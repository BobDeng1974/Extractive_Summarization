by @entity0 a football referee has been banned for life after allegedly headbutting another official after a youth match			2
@entity5 , 43 , was coaching an under 11s side at @entity8 ’s @entity7 when he was accused of assaulting the referee			1
he was originally fined ' for misconduct ' by @entity11 after the incident which took place on the car park at the non-league club			1
@entity5 , 43 , was coaching an under 11s side at @entity8 's @entity7 when he was accused of assaulting the referee in the car park after the match but now the regional @entity11 ’s referee @entity19 has imposed a lifetime refereeing ban			1
a @entity11 spokesman said : ' the referee committee have imposed a ban on him refereeing and that is subject to an appeal			1
' he did n’t have a personal hearing so he now has the opportunity to come along and puts his side forward			0
' mr @entity5 had been promoted to a @entity31 6 official in april last year - meaning he was able to referee county level matches			1
he also works as a junior and senior football development officer at @entity8			2
it comes days after a junior footballer was banned for seven years by @entity11 bosses after allegedly wiping spit on a referee 's back			2
@entity40 , 15 , reportedly spat on his hand and smeared it on the official at the end of a game between his side @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity49			0
he was reported to @entity50 and was stunned to later find out he had been banned from playing football until august 2021			0
he was originally fined ' for misconduct ' by @entity11 after the incident which took place on the car park at the non-league club ( pictured ) @entity8 chairman @entity57 added : ' the first i became aware of this ruling was on wednesday ( july 9 ) as i was leaving the country			1
i intend to discuss it fully with mr @entity5 on my return			2
' it should also be stated that he protests his innocence and that he will be appealing			0
' the club does not condone aggressive behaviour or any deviation from the high standards it sets for all it ’s officers , on or off the field , at any level			0
' one parent is now calling for the @entity76 side to take disciplinary action against mr @entity5 , who is also the club ’s junior secretary			1
the father - of - one , who did not want to be named , said : ' i hope that the club takes appropriate action @entity8 chairman @entity57 said that mr @entity5 insisted that he was innocent ' he oversees all of the youth teams and is supposed to set a positive example to the youngsters			1
' it ’s ridiculous that you can be banned from refereeing , but can continue to hold official positions at the football club			0
' if somebody like @entity92 can get banned from all football related activities for violent conduct , how can somebody who has been banned from refereeing be allowed to stay involved with the club ? ' being a referee himself you would think he would have respect for officials and what a tough job they have			0
' if he has been banned by the local @entity11 then surely he is n’t a good role model for the club ’s youngsters who are trying to make their way in the game			0
