by @entity0 a great grandmother has been banned from visiting a day centre in her own wheelchair after council health and safety bosses said it was made of the ' wrong ' kind of metal			1
retired nurse @entity8 , 80 , has been enjoying her outings to the centre in @entity11 , in her aluminium chair for six years without any complaints			1
but the pensioner was shocked to be told she has to leave her chair at home because it is not ' crash proof ' according to a new ' risk assessment '			1
banned : @entity8 , 80 , has been told by @entity19 that she can no longer be transported to a day centre in @entity11 in her aluminium wheelchair , because it is not ' crash proof '			1
the great grandmother has been told she must use a council approved steel chair instead			2
mrs @entity8 pays £ 2.40 a time to be transported by @entity19 from the doorstep of her home in @entity11 to the day centre three miles away			1
because the chair is not steel , but softer metal , council bosses are concerned about the risks of transporting her there in a wheelchair taxi or minibus			2
the authority fears that if there was a crash during the eight - minute journey the chair ’s frame might not withstand the impact - and the council could be held liable			2
mrs @entity8 said the first she knew of the new rule was when the council taxi service told her : ‘ i ’m sorry			1
we ca n’t take you because your wheelchair is not crash proof			1
' now the council drivers have to pick up a spare steel wheelchair from the day centre , take it to mrs @entity8 's home , and take her to the day centre in it			1
but the steel chair is too heavy for her to propel herself so she has to be pushed around by the care staff when she arrives - or just slump in an arm chair			2
she does not have the use of her left hand , having suffered a stroke affecting her left hand side , and would therefore be unable to move the heavier chair without help			1
mrs @entity8 , of @entity67 , @entity68 , has branded the ban ridiculous , particularly since she uses her own chair when her family take her out in a car			1
she has also been told by some of the care workers that they have taken clients out in the same type of aluminium chair without problems			2
she said : ' it is stupid idea			0
i have been going to the centre all these years in the aluminium chair and no one has said anything			1
lifeline : the retired nurse has been visiting the @entity88 day centre ( pictured ) for six years , with no problems			1
but @entity19 has now said her aluminuim wheelchair is not strong enough to withstand any possible crash , while travelling to and from the centre ' everyone has been having a good laugh about it			1
but on the serious side it has really upset me and i ca n’t sleep			0
' it is health and safety gone mad			2
my son asked me what the punch line was and i said " it is not a joke - it ’s true "			0
anger : mrs @entity8 branded the council risk assessment ' stupid ' , adding : ' it 's health and safety gone mad ' ' i have just paid over £ 75 for a new seat for my chair - and now they say it is no flipping good			1
' there is no way i ’m buying a steel one			0
a steel one would be too heavy and there is a long waiting list anyway			0
' her family say her visits to the @entity88 day centre have been a lifeline in the 80 - year - old 's twilight years			1
she has dinner there with her friends , plays bingo and dominoes , does a spot of baking , and goes for picnics in the local park			0
mrs @entity8 added : ' going to the day centre is the only time i can get out			1
i have had a stroke and ca n’t move far or walk very much			0
' sometimes they take us on to @entity143 on day trips in a mini bus			0
i suppose i wo n’t be able to go on those either now			0
' the silly thing is if i go in an ambulance to hospital for a check - up i go in my own chair			2
' if it can go in the back of an ambulance i do n’t see why the council ca n’t take me anywhere in it and the carers say they regularly take clients out in aluminium chairs			0
' a council spokeswoman said : ' the county council must ensure that people transported in wheelchairs in any of our vehicles are safe			0
' over the last couple of years therefore the county council has been carrying out a rolling programme of risk assessments to ensure that wheelchairs are suitable to be used on transport in line with the manufacturers ’ guidelines			0
' in cases where wheelchairs are found to be not suitable for transportation , the county council makes every effort to ensure that users are able to access their usual services			0
' in this case , the county council has arranged for a suitable wheelchair to be made available on a temporary basis so the customer can be transported in the usual way , until a permanent solution can be found			0
' but the @entity68 and @entity186 mp @entity185 said : ' it sounds like box ticking gone mad			0
i shall be looking into this			0
' if mrs @entity8 wants to get in touch with me i will speak to the county council on her behalf			2
' but on the face of it seems like one of the local authority more bizarre dictats			0
' there is clearly no health safety risk while she is inside the day centre			1
it is just a transportation issue			0

@entity8 has been visiting @entity88 day centre for six years
the 80 - year - old is wheelchair bound after suffering a stroke
her aluminium chair is light enabling her to push herself around
@entity19 said they can not transport her any longer
claim her chair is not ' crash proof ' because the metal is not strong enough
they will now only transport her to the centre in a steel wheelchair
but the retired nurse is not strong enough to get about in the heavier chair
mrs @entity8 said : ' it is health and safety gone mad '
