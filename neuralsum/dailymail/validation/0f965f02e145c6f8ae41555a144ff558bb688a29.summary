the wonderful thing with horses is that they know so little			2
@entity3 did n’t know he was a novice , did n’t know he was fragile , did n’t know he was n’t worth anything at all			1
he did n’t know a first - timer had n’t won the @entity7 since 1974 , or that winners of blue riband races are rarely so gauche that they lead from start to finish			1
and what he did n’t know could n’t hurt him			2
it is different for humans			2
@entity15 , wife of winning trainer @entity16 , and daughter of racing legend @entity18 , who bred @entity3 , remembers every doubt , every raised eyebrow , every cruel remark on the road to one of the most remarkable victories in the history of this race			1
@entity27 kisses the @entity7 following @entity29 's length - and - a - half victory @entity30 and trainer @entity31 are all smiles with the 2015 trophy on november 17 , after two years out with injury , @entity3 was withdrawn by a vet at the start of the @entity37 ’ @entity38 at @entity39			1
after 660 days off the track injured , the veterinary professional inspecting horses before the race decided @entity29 showed signs of lameness			2
‘ i said to him , “ it ’s not just any horse that you ’re f * * * * * * me about with here ” , ’ said mrs @entity15 , with a countryside earthiness that contrived to sound jolly , sporty and bloody furious at the same time			2
‘ and do you know what he said to me ? he said , “ he ’s had two years off , he ’s not worth anything anyway ”			1
’ no doubt there is a vet in the @entity58 area of @entity59 who is feeling a little sheepish this morning			2
the diagnosis aside — mrs @entity15 felt so angry about it she threatened to get her brother , a @entity62 , to sue — @entity3 was worth something after all			1
he was the horse that could , overcoming newness , shyness and an ability to pick up the strangest injuries to beat a field that included @entity70 on his last @entity7 ride , @entity72			1
to be fair , not even the love of the common people was present for @entity70 ’s horse , which went off at 14 - 1 and never contested , and some will say that @entity3 ’s victory was evidence of a poor field			1
@entity31 insisted there was no such thing — just the odd @entity7 that was more open than in other years , and either way , the manner in which @entity3 came home made him one of the bravest , if not the best , @entity84 has seen			1
there is something so marvellous about a front - runner			2
it is the honesty , for a start			2
it is why the public warmed to @entity94			2
by the time @entity3 came up the hill , any onlooker not financially involved will have been yearning for him to hold on			1
doubly so if they knew his history @entity3 clears the last hurdle to set up a grandstand finish at the @entity84 showpiece @entity30 and @entity3 clear a fence on their way to victory at the @entity7 ‘ this little mare that only cost £ 3,000 , ’ said @entity105 of @entity3 ’s mum , @entity107			1
she had been bought to give her father , who suffered from @entity111 ’s late in life , a little interest in his retirement			2
he bred @entity3 from her , and another horse of note , @entity117 , which won the @entity118 at @entity119 in 2011			1
‘ all of the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses , ’ mrs @entity15 added			0
‘ people quoted statistics at us , but this shows anyone can do it			0
i always said , when we win the @entity7 we ’ll win the lottery — it feels that amazing			1
@entity130 is n’t here , but he is looking down on us today , i know			0
‘ before the race i spoke to @entity133 , the jockey )			0
i was reminded of what @entity134 said about @entity136			0
nobody thought he could step up from two miles to three for the @entity7 but @entity134 said , “ if you go 20 yards clear , go 30 ”			1
that ’s what i told @entity133			0
if he wants to go clear , let him go clear			0
’ and he went clear			0
not by much , nothing like 20 lengths			0
the winning margin was one and a half lengths and @entity3 was made to fight by @entity149 and @entity150			1
@entity151 was told he did it the hard way			0
he said he did it the easy way			0
‘ he could go again , ’ he said , admiringly			0
in the distance , @entity3 steamed happily			1
they are proper horsey people , the @entity159 , and not just because @entity15 ’s father was a rider and later a brilliant journalist and broadcaster			0
it is a small stable , no more than 10 horses , and whatever @entity16 spends the proceeds on , it is n’t a stylist			0
his hair looked like he had been dragged through a hurdle backwards			0
he said he was n’t good at watching races and had spent @entity3 ’s three miles , two furlongs and 110 yards pacing and smoking			1
@entity15 had the air of a man who could have given @entity175 a run for his money in a smoke - off			2
his wife said he had nearly been arrested by security when his horse won			0
@entity30 celebrates following his 2015 @entity7 triumph at @entity84 @entity3 became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the @entity185 @entity30 is overcome with emotion on his way to the parade ring following @entity29 's thrilling victory @entity30 is congratulated by the @entity84 faithful as he makes his way to the winner 's enclosure @entity29 had been led up by the @entity159 ’ daughter @entity194 , whose junior riding career was curtailed by a neurological problem in her left leg following a kick from a horse			1
she would n’t have been able to walk two years ago , said @entity15			2
their son @entity200 , who has a showjumping background , is credited with a lot of work , too			0
@entity3 jumped beautifully , testament to the effort @entity200 has put in , along with rider @entity151			1
@entity15 said they had sent the horse over hurdles four times this week to prepare him for the @entity7			1
one imagines @entity15 is the real driving force in the family			0
‘ i ’m drinking champagne and @entity15 will be washing him down in his box , ’ @entity16 said			0
‘ she does most of the work behind the scenes			0
’ for there to be 41 years between novice victories at the @entity7 — the last one was captain @entity218 — suggests this was a win steeped in horse sense			1
the @entity222 knew @entity3 ’s injuries made it more experienced than the average novice , and chose to run it here rather than in wednesday ’s @entity38			1
the wet weather , and the result it helped produce , vindicated the call			2
captain @entity218 was seven when he outran @entity231 in 1974			0
@entity3 is a year older			1
mrs @entity15 talked about his perceived fragility — the ‘ ridiculous ’ long legs and a feisty temperament she believes can be expressed at the @entity236 stable , but would make him shrink in a big yard			0
‘ he ’s different , ’ she explained			0
‘ he got an injury to a small muscle at the top of one of his legs			0
the vet said he had never seen a horse hurt that muscle before			0
this was a different memory , without the sneer of that afternoon at @entity39			0
that vet said @entity3 had been nodding his head			1
‘ of course he was , he was excited to be on a course again , ’ mrs @entity15 explained			0
he did n’t know he had won the @entity7			1
but whatever the hell had just happened , it definitely seemed like fun the 2015 @entity7 champion punches the air as he is led past the grandstand @entity29 trainer @entity15 is overjoyed following his horse 's @entity84 result @entity29 ( right ) did just enough to beat @entity149 and @entity150 in a thrilling finish @entity70 looks dejected after @entity72 finished ninth at the @entity7 it was the 19 - times champion 's final ride in the @entity7 before his retirement @entity264 ( left ) and @entity265 were full of hope at the off and urge on husbands @entity269 and @entity270 as the race hots up @entity272 ( right ) was in attendance for the @entity7 @entity274 ( centre ) had to contend with second place as @entity149 finished a length and a half behind @entity3			1

@entity3 became the first novice in 41 years to win the @entity7 at @entity84
the eight - year old vindicated trainer @entity31 's *decision* to *opt* for a shot at the blue riband
@entity70 was ninth on @entity72 in what was his final ride in the @entity7 before retirement
