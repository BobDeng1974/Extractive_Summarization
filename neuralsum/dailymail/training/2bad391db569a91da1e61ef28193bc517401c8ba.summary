an epileptic boy who had 300 fits a day has had his life transformed by a high fat diet			1
six - year - old @entity3 from @entity4 , @entity5 , would lose consciousness when he had an attack			2
the youngster was taking a cocktail of drugs to control his severe seizures , but they left him drowsy and had little effect			2
@entity3 is epileptic and had up to 300 fits a day until he started following a high fat , low carbohydrate diet his desperate family were running out of options			1
so , when a neurologist suggested the family try a radical diet overhaul , @entity3 's parents , @entity22 and @entity23 , felt they had nothing to lose			1
within three weeks of putting @entity3 on a high fat , low carbohydrate ketogenic diet , @entity3 had stopped having seizures completely			1
his parents have also managed to wean him off his anti-seizure drugs completely			0
the ketogenic diet works by changing the fuel the body uses			1
the diet forces the body to burn fats , instead of glucose from carbohydrates , putting it into a state of ketosis , which appears to reduce seizures , although it remains unclear how this works			1
while @entity3 was struggling to eat any meals before the diet due to his severe seizures , he now clears his plate and loves butter so much he will eat it by the spoonful when he gets the chance			1
he also gorges on fatty foods such as cheese and cream			0
@entity3 ( pictured with his parents , @entity22 and @entity23 ) has not had a fit since his started following the diet @entity3 had his first epileptic fit when he was two and medication was unable to control his seizures mrs @entity59 , 47 , said : ‘ the diet has changed our lives for the better			1
as soon as @entity3 switched to it , it was as if a cloud had been lifted			0
‘ we were at our wit ’s end and just were just praying for a miracle			0
i was nervous about whether the diet would work			0
‘ @entity3 's fits were horrific , and as parents we were constantly worrying about him			2
she added : ‘ his first seizure was completely out the blue			0
he had no previous health problems , but stopped breathing one day			0
the ketogenic diet is a treatment option for epileptic children who do not respond to medication			1
it has been shown to reduce the number or severity of seizures , as well as to have positive effects on behaviour in some children			0
the diet is high fat and low carbohydrate			1
usually the body uses glucose from carbohydrates for fuel but the diet forces the body to use ketones - made when the body burns fat for energy - instead of glucose for its energy			1
it does this by depriving the body of carbohydrates			0
most often the ketogenic diet involves consuming a lot of fat from cream , butter and oil			1
it is not suitable for all children with epilepsy but can help those with @entity116 syndrome and @entity118 syndrome			0
to make sure the diet is nutritionally balanced , a dietitian has to work out exactly how much of which foods a child needs to eat each day			0
a @entity124 study suggested the diet helps about 40 per cent of children who have not responded to medication			0
source : @entity129 ‘ he was rushed to hospital and we were absolutely terrified			0
’ after @entity3 's first seizure at the age of two , they gradually got worse until the little boy was having 300 seizures a day , and drugs were failing to help him			2
the family endured two years of torment trying to find a solution to @entity3 's health problems , while also looking after their three other children @entity145 , 11 , @entity146 , 12 , and @entity147 , 14			0
the family were put in touch with charity @entity150 , who specialise in helping families and children who are embarking on the ketogenic diet			1
@entity3 's mother said : ‘ @entity157 's friends have been fantastic and really opened our eyes to the wonders of the diet			2
‘ they helped us work out exactly what @entity3 could eat , and what portion sizes he needed			2
’ ‘ he loves the meals on the diet and knows how important it is to stick to them			0
‘ @entity3 has definitely developed a taste for butter - he ca n't get enough of it and will eat it with a spoon if he can			0
’ it is important @entity3 sticks to the high fat diet as it been carefully calculated to ensure he is nourished but also keep his seizures at bay			1
@entity3 's father , 48 - year - old mr @entity3 , who works in the film industry , said : ‘ we were nervous about @entity3 relying on the diet alone to keep him seizure free , so weaning him off was a slow process , but since he was drug free it has been fantastic			1
@entity3 stopped having fits within three weeks of a doctor suggesting his parents put him on the ketogenic diet			1
he is pictured with parents , @entity22 and @entity23 , sister , @entity147 , and brothers , @entity146 and @entity145 ‘ @entity3 has his life back , and has n't had an attack since he started the diet , two years ago			1
it is a miracle and we could n't be happier			0
’ as part of his diet , @entity3 will have butter with every meal and has at least 12g with his breakfast , which is usually a cheese omelette , made with butter , oil , mushrooms , eggs and cheese			2
lunch comprises more high fat foods , including cheese and mayonnaise pitta bread , with yet more butter , and fruit			1
and for dinner he will have a high fat version of his family meals , which include lashings of extra butter on top of any meal			2
his mother carefully measures the ingredients in @entity3 's diet and he also takes additional vitamins to make sure he is fully nourished			2
@entity3 's mother carefully weighs his food and he follows a strict diet plan to ensure he is well nourished as well as following the ketogenic diet closely to prevent his seizures mrs @entity59 said : ‘ in the beginning it took a bit of planning and preparing but now we have worked out recipes for buttery foods which @entity3 enjoys			1
’ founder of @entity157 's friends , 46 - year - old @entity239 , @entity240 , started the charity after her own son , @entity157 , dramatically reduced his seizures after starting the diet			0
ms @entity239 said : ‘ to see the turnaround in @entity3 is phenomenal for him and his family			0
‘ before he started on the diet , he was suffering these horrendous seizures which may have worsened until @entity3 had no quality of life			2
‘ he is a phenomenal little boy who is now catching up and school and living his life - he is completely drug and seizure free and this is why we do it - to help children and families			0

@entity3 is epileptic and used to have *hundreds* of *debilitating* seizures
@entity262 failed to control them and his parents were losing hope
then a doctor suggested they try putting him on the ketogenic diet
this is a high fat , low carbohydrate diet than can help prevent seizures
it works by forcing the body to burn fat instead of sugar as fuel
it is not currently clear why this can prevent seizures but has helped @entity3
