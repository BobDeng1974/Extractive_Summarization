@entity0 has dubbed @entity1 ‘ the new @entity2 ’ in the wake of the @entity5 ’s pledge to bring back 1970s - style energy price freezes			1
and he mocked mr @entity1 ’s 8,000 - word speech – made without notes – saying sarcastically : ‘ he did well to remember @entity11 ’s entire 1983 election manifesto			1
’ the prime minister ’s private prediction that the next election , now just 18 months away , will be a re-run of the 1992 contest in which @entity17 defeated @entity2 , came on the eve of the @entity20 conference in @entity21			1
visiting time : @entity0 , the prime minister , and his wife @entity24 gear up for the @entity20 conference with a trip to the children 's cancer ward at the @entity29 in @entity30 yesterday mr @entity17 ’s victory came after @entity11 ’s lead in the polls was undermined by claims that their economic policy was too left - wing and lacked credibility			1
mr @entity1 ’s ‘ war on big business , ’ as the prime minister sees it , has convinced him that he will be able to portray the @entity5 as the new @entity2			1
mr @entity2 led the cheers at the conclusion of mr @entity1 ’s @entity44 speech last week			1
the prime minister also compared mr @entity1 ’s policies with the controversial election manifesto of @entity11 ’s @entity48 in 1983			1
that was dubbed the ‘ longest suicide note in history ’ and included a vow to scrap @entity52 ’s nuclear weapons			2
it led to @entity56 winning a landslide majority of 144 when the country went to the polls in june that year			1
leading the cheers : labour leader @entity1 clasps hands with his predecessor @entity2 , who famously lost to @entity17 's @entity63 in 1992 despite going into the general election with a healthy lead in the polls the second longest suicide note in history ? the @entity45 mocked mr @entity69 s 8,000 - word speech to his party conference , saying sarcastically : ' he did well to remember @entity72 s entire 1983 election manifesto ' mr @entity0 made his remarks as he announced plans for some married couples to get tax breaks worth up to £ 200 a year			1
a total of four million couples in marriages and civil partnerships , where both parties are basic - rate taxpayers , will benefit from a £ 1,000 transferable tax allowance from april 2015			1
labour critics said that an incentive that worked out at £ 3.85 a week was unlikely to persuade many people to tie the knot			1
mr @entity0 greets the @entity20 faithful in @entity21 : mr @entity0 made his remarks as he announced plans for couples in marriages and civil partnerships who pay basic - rate tax to get breaks worth up to £ 200 a year questions to answer : mr @entity0 was , on the eve of the conference , challenged by a leading conservative mp to break free from the party ¿ s ' @entity100 ' of pandering to left - wing opinion for approval @entity0 ’s pledge of tax breaks for marriage was last night branded ‘ social engineering ’ by one of his own @entity20 mps			1
the prime minister this weekend unveiled a £ 600million plan to give millions of couples tax relief to prove the party believed in marriage			1
but embarrassingly for the prime minister , the new flagship policy was under open attack from one ‘ happily married ’ @entity20 mp within 24 hours of the announcement			1
in a scathing response , @entity120 mp @entity119 dismissed the idea as a misuse of the tax system			1
he said : ‘ fiddling with the tax code to promote a policy of social engineering is not where i would go			2
i am a big supporter of marriage but i do n’t think we should be using the tax system to promote the things that we like			2
’ mr @entity0 was also challenged by a leading conservative mp to break free from the party ’s ‘ @entity100 ’ of pandering to left - wing opinion for approval			2
rising star @entity135 said the @entity63 should now stop concentrating on ‘ detoxifying ’ its image and being ‘ apologetic ’ for the faults of previous @entity20 governments			2
rising star : @entity135 said he was not afraid to back a ‘ less intrusive , smaller state ’ and mocked colleagues ‘ terrified ’ of being that labelled that way backbench mp mr @entity135 , who , like the prime minister went to @entity145 , also admitted he would ‘ love ’ to get a ministerial job			2
in an interview for @entity149 , mr @entity135 invoked the so - called @entity100 – in which a hostage takes the side of his captors – to suggest his party was still in hock to left - wing opinion			2
he said : ‘ for too long			0
we ’ve been captured by the @entity157 and we ’re apologetic about some of the positions we hold , on things like the economy , or welfare , or immigration			0
‘ if you believe you ’ve lost the battle and you have this sort of @entity100 , it limits your ability to win big majorities			0
’ mr @entity135 said he was not afraid to back policies for a ‘ less intrusive , smaller state ’ and mocked @entity20 colleagues ‘ who go nuts ’ and were ‘ terrified ’ of being that labelled that way			0
he also appeared to suggest that mr @entity0 ’s famous project to detoxify his party ’s image had run its course			0
mr @entity135 , a leading member of the party ’s @entity181 , said : ‘ the whole notion of detoxification of the @entity20 brand , i accept the idea , but people are sick of politicians trying to appear to be things they ’re not			0
‘ your first question should be , “ what is right ? ” – not “ what do i think is going to get me elected ? ’ ’ ’ rapists and knife - wielding thugs will no longer be let off with a warning under tough new laws to be announced this week			1
justice secretary @entity197 , writing in today ’s @entity199 , pledges : ‘ there will be no more cautions for rape , for burglary , for possession of a firearm			0
' and there will be no more cautions for an adult caught carrying a knife			0
i want to see those people in court facing charges			0
‘ if someone out in the town centre is carrying a knife in their pocket with no plausible excuse , a slap on the wrist seems like soft justice in the extreme			0
knife crime is a blight on our society			0
’ more than 500,000 people have been let off with cautions for serious offences in the past 15 years , including more than 400 sex offenders			0
the out - of - court penalty does not count as a conviction and does not have to be disclosed to employers			0
they are popular with police as they count towards solved crimes and are quick			0
mr @entity197 ’s move is likely to please delegates at the @entity20 conference looking for ‘ red meat ’ law and order policies in the run - up to the next election			1
more than one in five @entity20 councillors think @entity0 should form a pact with @entity249 at the next election , to avoid splitting the vote and handing victory to @entity11			1
the poll , for @entity253 , comes as @entity254 prepares to appear at the @entity20 conference			2
the @entity249 leader , who is barred from inside the secure zone , will address three fringe meetings , one titled ‘ conservative and @entity249 : enemies or allies ? ’ , and organised by the @entity262 , whose previous president was the @entity264			0
he will speak alongside @entity20 mp @entity265 who will argue that @entity249 candidates should not run against ‘ avowed eurosceptics ’ in the 2015 election			2
the event is expected to be attended by @entity20 members of the @entity271 group			0
there is growing speculation @entity249 might agree not to run candidates against such mps at the next election			2
last night , arch - @entity278 @entity20 mp @entity277 suggested an ‘ understanding ’ where @entity249 did not field candidates against like - minded @entity63 and in return , @entity63 gave @entity249 a free run in @entity284 - held seats			0
he added : ‘ if we end up replacing @entity284 with @entity276 , then hallelujah ! ’ but @entity20 colleague @entity286 dismissed talk of any pact , saying @entity249 was too ‘ disparate ’ to work with			0
a @entity249 spokesman ruled out a ‘ formal deal ’ , but said local branches had ‘ independence ’ over the issue .			0

@entity45 predicts the next election will be re-run of ' 92 when @entity17 beat @entity2
@entity2 led the cheers for @entity1 at last week 's @entity11 conference
