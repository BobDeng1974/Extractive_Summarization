two young thais have been jailed for more than two years for defaming the monarchy in a university play			1
student @entity6 , 23 , and activist @entity7 , 26 , had pleaded guilty to defamation following their arrests last august , nearly a year after ' @entity3 ' - a satire set in a fictional kingdom - was performed			1

@entity19 student @entity6 ( left ) , 23 , and activist @entity7 ( right ) , 26 , are escorted by prison security guards after their verdict at the @entity22 in @entity17 ' the court considers their role in the play caused serious damage to the monarchy and sees no reason to suspend their sentences , ' he told a packed courtroom including the accused , their relatives and representatives from the @entity34 human rights office and @entity35			1
rights groups say ' lese majeste ' prosecutions have surged since the army seized power from an elected government last may			1
the military seeks legitimacy from its self - designated role as protector of the monarchy			0
king @entity47 , 87 , is revered by many in the country as a demi - god and anyone convicted of insulting the king , queen , heir or regent faces up to 15 years in jail on each count			2
the pair had each been charged with one count of lese majeste linked to the performance at @entity17 's @entity62 , to mark the 40th anniversary of a pro-democracy student protest on the campus that was brutally crushed by the military regime in october 1973			1
after they were taken out of court in handcuffs their lawyer @entity67 said her clients would not appeal			0
@entity6 ( pictured between two security guards ) , and @entity7 were arrested last august , nearly a year after ' @entity3 ' - a satire set in a fictional kingdom - was performed police are still hunting for at least six others involved in the play for allegedly violating ' 112 ' - the feared section of the @entity19 criminal code that is one of the world 's most draconian royal defamation laws			1
of those on the wanted list , at least two have fled @entity19 , joining dozens of academics , activists and political opponents of the military regime in self - exile since the coup			0
the @entity94 - based @entity93 said at least 40 people have been arrested since the takeover - with nine of them sentenced to between two and 15 years in prison			2
critics say the lese majeste law has been used as a tool to suppress political dissent , noting that many of those charged have been linked to the opposition @entity105 movement			1
rights activists as well as local and international media are forced to censor discussion of cases since even repeating details of charges risks breaking the law			0
under junta rule @entity19 has seen a rapid deterioration in civil rights with the military crushing any criticism of the coup - from banning protests and censoring the media to arresting and detaining opponents			2
local students and activists show their support after a court announced the verdict on the two young @entity125 who were accused of insulting the monarchy in a university play ' @entity3 ' was performed in october 2013 , several months before the coup , but the case is just one of many driven through by the junta			2
' the junta is using the law to bolster its legitimacy with the @entity19 people , ' said @entity137 , director of research at the @entity139 in @entity140			0
previous administrations including that of ousted premier @entity143 have also used the legislation in this way , but the junta has been ' even stronger ' in asserting its ' obedience to the monarchy ' through the crackdown , he added			0
@entity150 from the @entity93 also said the junta was drawing legitimacy through the monarchy and that the surge in lese majeste cases looked set to continue			1
' we 're expecting a lot more people to go to jail in the next month			0
almost all cases have been backdated ( for alleged offences ) before the coup , ' he told @entity164			0
' it 's a very grim situation for rights in @entity19			0
' analysts say the most recent chapter of @entity19 's long - drawn political turmoil is fuelled by anxieties over who will run the country when the more than six - decade reign of the world 's longest - serving monarch eventually ends .			0
