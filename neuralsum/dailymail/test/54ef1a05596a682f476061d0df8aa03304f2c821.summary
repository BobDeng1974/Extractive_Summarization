the family of a four - year - old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered more than 75 years ago have accused police of a ' cover - up ' after officers ordered that the case file be kept secret until 2040			1
@entity7 was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in @entity13 on september 28 , 1939			1
the schoolgirl had been walking with her older brother @entity15 , who was seven at the time , but she disappeared when he lost sight of her			0
her body was found dumped by a railway station but police have never caught her killer			1
now , @entity22 , 71 , who is @entity7 's cousin , has accused the @entity23 of a ' cover - up ' after the force said information could not be released about her murder because it is unfair to the mystery suspect			1
@entity7 was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in @entity13 on september 28 , 1939			1
her body was found but her killer has never been caught the front page of the @entity31 shows the newspaper report following @entity7 's death in september 1939 , and reveals how officers want to track down a ' man with a slouch ' in connection with her murder mr @entity22 , who was not born at the time his relative was abducted and killed , used the @entity39 to find out more information about the case			1
he contacted the @entity23 about the killing - the oldest unsolved murder in @entity44 - since the @entity46 - based force was drafted in to help @entity47 with serious crimes at the time			2
he said that while he managed to establish that the force holds documents about the case , officers slapped an order on the file demanding it be kept secret for 100 years after the events concerned - until january 2040			1
a decision letter sent to mr @entity22 said : ' a named subject who was a suspect is described derogatorily and should not be associated with these matters			0
' as an unsolved murder , with potential of re-investigation at any indeterminate stage , practice to close for 100 years is invoked			0
the family of @entity7 ( pictured ) are accusing police of a ' cover - up ' for not releasing paperwork on the case ' however unlikely - indeed remote - it may be that this case is re-opened , we have to afford for that possibility			1
putting information into the public domain will include naming specific persons who may yet be identified			0
' these persons who may be living may have been witnesses and / or interviewees and who were not prosecuted and who therefore must be regarded as innocent parties			0
' persons will have given witness statements in the expectation that their information would not become public knowledge			0
' mr @entity22 said he ' does not accept the reason for refusing to release the documents '			0
he said : ' this smacks of a cover - up to me			1
as a result of this decision , which i am appealing against , i would n't get access to the file until i was 96 , even if i lived that long			0
' @entity7 's murder had a devastating impact on the family			2
@entity15 never forgave himself for letting @entity7 out of his sight as they walked home			2
' he never came to terms with it and died about eight years ago			0
' the body of @entity7 , who lived in the @entity104 area of @entity13 , was found on a railway embankment near @entity107 station just weeks after @entity108 declared war on @entity110			1
it was discovered by a dog walker who came across her remains when his spaniel began barking			0
dozens of @entity7 's schoolfriends turned out for her funeral on october 4 , 1939 , as documented in the @entity120 ( above )			2
the funeral procession went through @entity104 in @entity13 @entity7 was buried at @entity123 's @entity122 in @entity13 and has since been joined by her late mother @entity124 police found a copy of the @entity128 newspaper and a tobacco pouch near her body , and outlined at least two suspects in connection with her murder			1
newspaper reports from the @entity31 at the time , reveal how police wanted to trace a ' man with a slouch ' in connection with the killing			0
however , despite interviewing more than one thousand people and following numerous leads , @entity7 's killer has never been caught			1
mr @entity22 , who is desperate to learn more information about the case , has since been in touch with a leading forensic scientist who has told him that advances in dna technology could now make it possible to identify the killer			2
the family believe that had the murder occurred in modern day then her killer would have been caught			2
@entity156 has contacted @entity23 and @entity47 for comment .			0
