the efforts by the current chancellor , @entity2 , and the @entity3 to regain control of the public finances looks to be working @entity6 is on track to deliver the biggest turnaround in public finances by any advanced economy since the @entity11 , according to a report			1
the independent @entity13 says that if current policy remains in place the public finances will return to balance by 2018 - 19 – producing the first surplus for 18 years			0
‘ it would represent one of the largest budget reductions among advanced countries in the post-war period , ’ says its report			0
the @entity13 seeks to shed light on the causes and consequences of the build - up of deficit and debt in @entity6 since the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008			1
it heaped blame for hefty budget deficits on reckless spending by @entity33 in the period that @entity35 was prime minister and @entity37 was chancellor			0
it says the lavish spending plans announced by @entity33 in the 2007 @entity39 were adhered to despite the onset of the banking crisis , which was heralded by the collapse of @entity43 in 2007 and the subsequent failure of @entity45 in 2008			1
indeed , @entity33 actually advanced some capital spending plans – not due to take place until 2010 - 2011 – to the year before			1
it also spent heavily on employment support at a time when tax receipts were plummeting because of the depth of the recession			0
the efforts by the current chancellor , @entity2 , and the @entity3 to regain control of the public finances looks to be working even though returning to the black has been delayed			2
most significantly perhaps , the @entity58 - led government has taken an axe to the public sector , reducing spending to 38 per cent of the nation ’s output			1
that is a figure not seen since the early 2000s , when @entity33 abandoned the spending ceilings inherited from the @entity67 and embarked on a spending free - for - all			0
the improvement in finances has largely been achieved by cutting the spending of @entity72 departments , which ballooned in the latter years of the @entity33 government			2
the report heaped blame for hefty budget deficits on reckless spending by @entity33 in the period that @entity35 was prime minister there have also been sharp cutbacks in capital spending and the welfare budget also has been brought back under control			2
contrary to public perceptions spending on the @entity85 has continued to expand against the background of deep reductions in the annual spending of departments			2
budgetary woes were increased as a result of the financial crisis			0
as the economy plunged into recession and output plummeted so did the income the government received from taxes			0
cash receipts and nominal gdp ( the output of the economy without adjustment for inflation ) both fell in real terms in the years 2007 - 08 and 2009 - 10 – ‘ a rare event ’ says the @entity13			0
@entity106 , the @entity13 ’s director , described the surge in spending by @entity33 , at a time of worsening public finances , as ‘ unusual ’			1
he noted that other countries ‘ were trying to pre-fund the rising costs of ageing by getting the debt down in good times ’			0
as a result of @entity33 ’s reckless spending patterns @entity6 national debt climbed by 2.5 per cent of national output a year between 2004 and 2007 , a faster rate than @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 – the currently very sick eurozone countries			1
the @entity13 warns that the biggest risk to a return to health in the public finances is that the current government or a future one adopts different policies and abandons commitments to keep spending on a tight rein .			1

@entity6 is on track to deliver the biggest turnaround since @entity11
