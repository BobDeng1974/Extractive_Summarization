the bizarre patent for a ' wearable computing device , comprising a wig that is adapted to cover at least a part of a head of a user ' has been filed by electronics giant @entity16			1
the @entity18 patent describes a terrifying - sounding device called a @entity20 , which is packed with sensors and special devices that vibrate on the user ’s head to give them messages such as driving directions			1
the bizarre patent for a ' wearable computing device , comprising a wig that is adapted to cover at least a part of a head of a user , ' has been filed by electronics giant @entity16			1
it has a circuit board hidden under the hair and can talk to a second device - such as a phone the application describes a standard wig that could ‘ be made from horse hair , human hair , wool , feathers , yak hair or any kind of synthetic material			0
’ however , the wig could also include special fibres that move , changing its shape			1
it has a circuit board hidden under the hair and can talk to a second device - such as a phone			0
‘ the user can wear the wearable computing device as a regular wig while looking natural at the same time , ’ the says			2
wearers of the wig can give presentations wearing it and switched slides by tapping their sideburns , under which buttons are hidden			1
they may not be as impressive as @entity65 ' sideburns , who is pictured here after winning the @entity67 it vibrates on a user 's head to give them messages , such as driving directions			1
people can wear it to give presentations by tapping their sideburns			1
it also has a laser pointer built in for presentations			0
a built - in gps chip could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they do n't bump into things			0
the wig could include special fibres that move to change its shape			1
they could be worn by couples who want to make each other 's hairpieces vibrate			0
@entity16 has already tested the wig with employees who gave presentations wearing it and switched slides by tapping their sideburns			1
' one or two switch buttons may be provided under the sideburns of the wig , and the one or more buttons are connected to the external computer via a wireless connection ( using the @entity105 module ) , ' @entity16 ’s documents reveal			1
the @entity20 also has a gps chip built in and ultrasound sensors that could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they do n’t walk into things			2
' during a presentation the user may , for example , move forward or backward through presentation slides by simply pushing the sideburns			1
thus , the user can control the presentation slides simply by natural behaviour like touching side burns			2
' the @entity20 also has a gps chip built in and ultrasound sensors that could monitor the area around the wearer to make sure they do n't walk into things the @entity20 also has a built in laser pointer for presentations			2
‘ the laser pointer may , for example , be arranged on a forehead part of the wig , so that the user may point out relevant information on the projected slide in the above - explained presentation mode			2
’ @entity16 even says the wigs could be worn by couples			0
' if one user touches one of his / her vibration motors , the other users equivalent motor may vibrate , ' the patent says			2
as tech giants try to out - do each other by patenting cyborg - like technologies , @entity143 has recently filed a patent for a ' tattoo , ' which would be placed onto a person 's throat and pick sounds created by their voice			0
if the user is making a phone call , the tattoo would then send these sounds wirelessly to the smartphone and the caller			0
the patent is called ‘ coupling an electronic skin tattoo to a mobile communication device ’ and was originally filed in may last year			0
throughout the patent , @entity143 calls the device ‘ electronic tattoo 110 ’ and said it would ‘ comprise audio circuitry that enables reception of acoustic signals from a person 's throat ’			0
put simply , the tattoo ’s built - in microphone could pick up the sounds made by a person ’s voice by reading vibrations and fluctuations of muscle or tissue from their voicebox			0
it continues that the tattoo would either contain a battery that ‘ may or may not be rechargeable ’ , or alternatively , could be powered by an @entity184 or @entity185 charging device .			0

@entity16 has filed a patent for a @entity20 packed with sensors and special devices that vibrate on the user ’s head to give them messages
the @entity197 *multinational* said the wig could also include special fibres that move , changing its shape but claim it looks natural
it has been used by employees who gave presentations wearing it and switched slides by tapping their sideburns
