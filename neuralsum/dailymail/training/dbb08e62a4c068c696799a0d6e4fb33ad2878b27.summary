by @entity0 published : 22:01 est , 28 march 2012 updated : 22:22 est , 28 march 2012 while there have been reports of @entity5 agents stealing valuable items from travellers bags , it was one agent 's extra-curricular activity that got him arrested on wednesday			2
@entity11 @entity10 , 39 , was arrested during his shift at @entity14 's @entity13 for his alleged involvement with a prostitution ring			1
court documents say that he was the mastermind behind a group sex tryst that took place in a @entity21 hotel room the day after @entity22			2
arrested : @entity23 , 39 , was charged with five counts relating to prostitution after he was caught organizing a group sex event on february 15 the manager of the @entity28 became suspicious when @entity10 repeatedly came down to the lobby - as he was the only one with key card access to the elevator - to get groups of men who were waiting there			1
this raised a red flag for the manager because she recognized @entity10 from prior visits to the hotel and ' because this behavior is not typical of @entity28 guests , ' according to the affidavit			2
the manager then called police to report suspected prostitution activity , and they escorted to the room @entity10 had rented out			1
when he opened it , he denied that prostitution was taking place and invited officers inside.instead , he said that he had posted an ad on @entity53 for a swingers party			1
there , they found 11 people including ' three naked females and four males attempting to get dressed '			0
' multiple people were laying on the two beds , and other people were sitting in chairs and standing in the room , ' the report states			0
work : since 2002 , @entity10 had worked for the @entity5 at @entity13 just outside of @entity14 upon questioning , one of the men said that he paid @entity69 $ 100 to participate in the tryst			0
though he was promptly fired and denies the charges , it is not the first time that @entity10 , who worked for the @entity5 since 2002 , has received a prostitution - related complaint			0
it is not clear whether any charges were filed following the 2009 incident , but a @entity5 official told police that the ' very similar ' complaint ' alleged that @entity10 was operating a prostitution ring and charging individuals $ 25 for sexual acts '			1
again , @entity10 denies any wrongdoing , saying that the @entity5 is out to get him and he plans to file a racial discrimination complaint with the @entity87			0
unusual behavior : a manager at the @entity90 called police because she suspected something when @entity10 kept going down to the lobby to collect waiting men the @entity5 said in a statement that they were cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation			1
' the allegations against this individual are unacceptable and in no way reflect the integrity and professionalism of the more than 50,000 security officers who strive every day to ensure the security of the traveling public , ' they said in the statement			0
regardless of his plans , @entity10 stands charged with five counts relating to prostitution and is due to appear in court on may 8 .			0
