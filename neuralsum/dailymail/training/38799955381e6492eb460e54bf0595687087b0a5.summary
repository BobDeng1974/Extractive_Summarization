by @entity0 fresh charges : more women have come forward after @entity4 ' conviction for child abuse which could lead to further charges @entity4 could face fresh sexual abuse charges because more women have already come forward after his conviction for 12 indecent assaults			1
the @entity12 star was yesterday found guilty of a string of sex attacks on victims as young as seven over 18 years			1
the @entity16 said today the celebrity 's conviction has given others the courage to come forward and report sex attacks			1
but @entity21 said it is too early to say whether @entity4 , 84 , will face fresh criminal charges over claims from women who say they were also abused			1
' we know there has been more reporting , what we do n't know yet is whether or not more charges will follow , ' she told @entity31			0
' we will work with the police and look at any cases that they send to us to see whether there is enough evidence to bring more charges			0
so it is too early to say really			0
' ms @entity21 said @entity4 had been exposed for using ' elements of grooming ' when targeting his daughter 's best friend , who he indecently assaulted over many years beginning when she was just 13			1
she added : ' these were nasty assaults committed by a man who thought he was not going to be discovered and who thought he was above the law			1
' @entity4 was revealed as a ' @entity48 ' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to ' mesmerise ' underage fans before abusing them with impunity			2
' he committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law ' , @entity54 said			2
the legal bullying meant the @entity74 did not name the paedophile predator until four months after he was first quizzed by detectives			2
when the news blackout ended , a flood of other victims went to the police to back up the first woman â€™s claims			0
but asked if more women might have come forward if @entity4 ' name had been publicised earlier , mrs @entity21 said it was a ' difficult balance to draw '			1
non committal : @entity16 @entity21 says she is not sure if @entity4 will face fresh charges but is aware of the new accusations she said : ' it is difficult , there are arguments on both sides - some people feel that they have been named and then if no charges are brought their reputation has been tarnished			1
' but at the same time we have seen both in @entity4 and in other cases that if victims know that people are reporting that someone has been arrested they feel safer in coming forward , they feel they are not the only one and therefore we have seen more and more victims coming forward as people have been named			1
' @entity4 is the second celebrity to be convicted under @entity104 , which was set up in the wake of the @entity107 scandal			0
ms @entity21 defended the police probe , saying it showed ' no - one is above the law '			2
and she dismissed criticism that only a few of the high - profile arrests of celebrities had so far resulted in convictions			0
she told @entity118 's today programme : ' what you have to remember is that we get it right in 86 % of cases , we get convictions in 86 % of those cases that we take			0
' so we are not risk averse , we have to be very careful that we do n't get to a situation where we only take very short cases			0
' it 's a matter for the criminal justice system and the juries to decide whether or not they believe , and whether they are satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that we put before them			0
' that 's a very different test from the one that we take , which is , is there a realistic prospect of conviction			0

*director* of public *prosecutions* says there are already new sex abuse claims
@entity21 believes women have new courage after @entity4 conviction
@entity4 ' groomed ' young girls and committed ' nasty assaults ' because ' he thought he was above the law ' , she said
his arrest kept secret for four months by his legal team citing @entity159
but mrs @entity21 refuses to be drawn on whether this stopped more victims coming forward earlier
