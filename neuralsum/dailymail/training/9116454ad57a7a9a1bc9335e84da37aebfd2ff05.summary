by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 12:10 est , 28 november 2012 the passenger aircraft of the future could one day be flown by remote by pilots sitting in a control room hundreds of miles away			2
tests on a new breed of civilian aircraft which use the same pilotless technology currently found in military drones begin next month in the @entity10			1
the consortium behind the project hopes it will dramatically slash the costs of air travel , make possible new airborne services , and free pilots from potentially dangerous but essential missions			1
staged by government - backed consortium @entity33 ( @entity35 ) , the test are will look at how well communications links operate with pilotless aircraft			1
it will also test failsafe systems that will allow the aircraft 's computers to take autonomous control of the flight should contact with the ground be broken			2
@entity35 is a £ 62million programme backed by the @entity10 government and seven aerospace companies including @entity10 firms @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
modern planes are already capable of taking off , flying to a destination and landing with no human interference whatsoever			0
but the @entity21 test will see whether they are able to do those things safely without a pilot - while at the same time complying with the rules of the skies			2
death from above : a @entity64 @entity63 mq - 9 reaper drone takes off from @entity65 , @entity66 the unmanned aircraft will need to be able to ' sense and avoid ' other planes that may cross its path			1
in the case of large - scale commercial aircraft this is easy			1
in most cases these are equipped with transponders warning of the plane 's presence - and sometimes its course , altitude and speed			2
it ’s one of the drawbacks for anyone setting off for far - flung places : how bad will the jet lag be when you get there ? those feelings of tiredness and disorientation could become a thing of the past , however - thanks to what are claimed to be the world ’s first ‘ time - control ’ spectacles			2
the high - tech glasses emit a soft green glow which is said to work on the human body clock to change our sleep patterns			0
using the device , called the @entity103 , means long - haul air passengers can step off the plane feeling fresh , even after a flight from @entity10 to @entity107 , say the sleep researchers who created it			1
inventor professor @entity111 said the glasses could also help insomnia sufferers , keep shift workers more alert and get teenagers out of bed in the morning			0
‘ the light from @entity103 stimulates the part of the brain responsible for regulating the 24 - hour body clock , ’ said professor lack , of @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity107			0
‘ using a light device allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps			0
this eliminates the sudden change people experience after flying and reduces the symptoms of jet lag			0
’ however , light aircraft and gliders are not legally required to be equipped with such beacons , meaning that @entity35 's @entity21 must also be able to ' see ' through video cameras attached to image - recognition software			1
in other tests , to be carried out over the @entity141 , aircraft will be flown near to the unmanned plane , with some following a deliberate collision course to see whether the drone can recognise the danger and take evasive action			0
' the results to date suggest you can do sense - and - avoid as well as a human , ' @entity147 , director of @entity35 , told @entity25			0
the market for such a technology is potentially huge , and lucrative			0
in the @entity64 , @entity154 has asked aviation regulators to make unmanned aircraft work with the existing air - traffic control system as soon as 2015			1
small drones are already used commercially for things like aerial photography , but in most jurisdictions they must remain within sight of their pilot on the ground			0
with the costs of pilotless aircraft much lower than manned aircraft or helicopters , such commercial drones could make tasks like road traffic monitoring , border patrols , police surveillance far cheaper			1
they also have potential applications in environments which pose a risk to pilots , including monitoring forest fires or accidents at nuclear power plants			0
they even have the potential for providing temporary airborne @entity185 or mobile phone services			2
by 2020 , the global market for civilian unmanned aircraft and services could , according to some analysts be worth more than $ 50billion , @entity25 reported			1
commercial freight and postal flights could one day also lose on - board pilots , but questions remain as to whether airlines could persuade customers to board pilotless passenger aircraft - no matter what the discount			1
the hope is , rather , that such flights will have just one pilot in the future , rather than the team of two found on most modern airliners .			0

civilian aircraft would use same pilotless technology as military drones
it could slash costs of air travel and make possible new airborne services
government - backed £ 62m project begins testing over @entity31 next month
