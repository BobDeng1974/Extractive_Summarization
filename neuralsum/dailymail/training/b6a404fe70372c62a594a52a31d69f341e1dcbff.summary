tremors , excessive salivation and difficulty breathing are all signs you may have been bitten by a @entity5			1
in a number of cases , the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom ; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time			1
now scientists from around the world are hoping to harvest @entity15 , the active ingredient in the spider 's venom , to create a natural @entity18 that can work in 20 minutes			1
tremors , excessive salivation and difficulty breathing are all signs you may have been bitten by a @entity5 ( pictured )			1
in a number of cases , the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom ; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time @entity5 can cause priapism - a condition which occurs when blood becomes trapped in the penis , leading to abnormally long - lasting erections			1
to discover exactly how @entity15 does this , @entity32 from @entity33 reported that researchers cut off the penis of a dead mouse , and connected it to an electrical stimulator			0
scientists from the @entity40 were then able to measure the contraction of the muscles in tissue when they came into contact with different chemicals			2
they discovered that not only does the venom work , but it also has fewer side effects compared with existing erectile dysfunction drugs , such as @entity18			2
although drugs such as @entity18 , @entity50 and @entity51 have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years , around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement			1
a drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative			2
stock pictured used never mind those little blue pills – men who have problems between the sheets could reinvigorate themselves simply by eating a @entity66 diet			0
eating fish , salads and olive oil , and enjoying the odd glass of wine , could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence , according to @entity76 cardiologist @entity75			0
he said his research had shown that consuming such healthy foods helped clean out blood vessels , especially the narrow ones in the penis that are essential for a man to perform			0
dr @entity75 , an expert on erectile dysfunction at @entity84 in @entity85 , said : ‘ the @entity66 diet is well known to be a healthy diet , one that is associated with longevity , wellbeing , lower incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease			0
‘ and this is very important , because people can choose this type of diet to prevent or restore their vascular health			0
’ he explained that when a man had problems achieving an erection , ‘ it can be a sign of worse health problems to come ’ , because the blood vessels in the penis were ‘ very , very sensitive ’ to what was happening in the rest of the body			0
‘ adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reverse moderate erectile dysfunction , ’ dr @entity75 said			0
back in 2011 , when the research took place , dr @entity111 , a physiologist at the college , said : ' the venom of the @entity5 nigriventer spider is a very rich mixture of several molecules			1
' these molecules are called toxins , and then we have various toxins in this venom with different activity			2
' because of this , when a human is bitten by this spider , we can observe many different symptoms including priapism , a condition in which the penis is continually erect			1
' separate tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide , a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow			0
since then , researchers have also successfully recreated the @entity142 - 6 gene and infected a culture of caterpillar cells which produced the spider toxin			1
this artificial venom proved effective on rats			0
ms @entity32 reports that now scientists can create more of the venom , trials to determine the toxicity of the drug in humans may take place – although a product is likely to be years away			1
although drugs such as @entity18 , @entity50 and @entity51 have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years , around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement			1
for these men , the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis , or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ			0
a drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative			0
scientists from the @entity40 found that not only does the venom work , but also has fewer side effects than existing erectile dysfunction drugs , such as @entity18			2

venom of the @entity5 contains ingredient @entity142 - 6
this can cause priapism - a condition that causes painful erections
scientists have now been able to create @entity142 - 6 using caterpillar cells
testing on humans may follow soon , but treatment could be years away
