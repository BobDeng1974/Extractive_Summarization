by @entity0 and @entity1 the last of the 29 @entity2 whose tribal language was used to develop a code that stumped the @entity6 during the @entity7 has died aged 93			1
@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , died wednesday morning of kidney failure , @entity12 , who helped @entity8 write his memoirs , said			1
he was one of seven veterans honored for their bravery in november last year , when he was presented with the @entity17 for distinguished service			2
hero : @entity8 , who was one of the 29 members of the @entity22 tribe who created a secret code , has died code : a two - man team of @entity22 code talkers send orders over a radio during the @entity7 before hundreds of men from the @entity31 became @entity32 , 29 @entity22 were recruited to develop the code based on their then - unwritten language			1
@entity8 was in 10th grade when he enlisted , keeping his decision a secret from his family and lying about his age , as did many others			1
the @entity42 @entity41 used codetalkers in every @entity45 assault from 1942 to 1945			0
the @entity46 used a code based on their language , which was never cracked by the @entity6			1
it was estimated that outside of tribes , fewer than 30 people understood the @entity52 during the @entity7			0
native american language had also been used for code purposes in the @entity55			2
the code was made up of unrelated @entity58 words that would be translated into @entity59			2
the first letter of the translated word would then be used to build up the message			0
when the @entity41 developed the code they had to create new words in the language to incorporate military terms , including ' besh - lo ' meaning iron fish for submarine , and ' dah - he - tih - hi ' , which translates as humming bird , for fighter planes			2
the @entity74 , as the @entity41 became known , were essential to the war effort , with @entity76 , a @entity77 signal officer , saying : ' were it not for the @entity2 , the @entity41 would never have taken @entity78			1

using @entity22 words for red soil , war chief , clan , braided hair , beads , ant and hummingbird , for example , they came up with a glossary of more than 200 terms that later was expanded , and an alphabet			2
@entity8 has said he was concerned the code would n't work			1
at the time , few non-navajos spoke the language			0
even @entity22 who did could n't understand the code			2
' i was very proud to say that the @entity6 did everything in their power to break that code but they never did , ' he told @entity123 last year			2
having his language used as a code was a big step for @entity8 , who recalled how he and other @entity128 boys would have their mouths washed out with soap for speaking it at government boarding schools			1
when he was a child , the @entity22 language was all @entity8 spoke , as he helped his family tend sheep on a reservation			1
he was eventually sent to a government - run boarding school that had been set up to assimilate native americans with mainstream culture , according to the @entity141			0
proud : @entity142 , pictured during a signing for @entity144 , was pleased that the @entity6 were never able to break their code honor : @entity147 were presented with a @entity148 in 2001 secret weapon : the @entity22 language made the perfect basis for a code because so few people knew it			2
pictured are two @entity32 in @entity153 in 1943 the @entity22 trained in radio communications for the war effort were walking copies of the code			1
each message read aloud by a @entity32 was immediately destroyed			0
' the @entity6 did everything in their power to break the code but they never did , ' @entity8 said in 2010			1
after the war @entity8 volunteered to serve two more years during the @entity163			1

their mission was n't declassified until 1968			0
the accolades came much later			0
the @entity32 are now widely celebrated			0
the original group received @entity174 in 2001 , and a movie - @entity74 - which was based on the unit was released the following year			2
war hero : @entity8 helped develop the code from his tribal language vital : the work of the @entity128 codetalkers was celebrated in the 2002 film @entity74 , above they have appeared on television and in parades , and routinely are asked to speak to veterans groups and students			1
@entity8 threw the opening pitch at a 2004 @entity190 game and offered a blessing for the presidential campaign of @entity193			1
