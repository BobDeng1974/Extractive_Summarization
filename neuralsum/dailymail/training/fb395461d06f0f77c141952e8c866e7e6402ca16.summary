by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 17 january 2014 updated : 06:24 est , 17 january 2014 it is known as the @entity3 , so it is perhaps no surprise to find that the porn industry is moving to @entity7 after @entity8 passed a law requiring performers to use condoms			1
as the industry struggles to survive in an age of free websites and amateur videos uploaded to the internet , producers looking to cut costs are also attracted by the cheap hotels , mansions and warehouses to use for their films			1
in a worrying development , many adult film makers are also using the move as a way to get around stringent health checks imposed in @entity8 , including a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms , brought in after several actors tested positive for @entity32			1
cheeky : since a law requiring all male performers to wear condoms in @entity8 requests for permits have dropped 95 per cent , from 480 in 2012 to just 24 in the first nine months of 2013 several big name producers have already moved to @entity7 , while experts predict it could house 20 per cent of the industry by the end of this year the number of permits requested to make porn films in @entity46 has declined by an estimated 95 percent since the law took effect , according to @entity49 , a private nonprofit that issues the licenses			1
the number of applications fell from about 480 in 2012 to just 24 through the first nine months of 2013			0
at the adult entertainment expo , taking place in @entity7 this week , porn purveyor @entity53 warned reporters not to ask him about condoms , but said : ' it 's not really an option to change the way we make our movies , and moving production is n't that hard			1
' in @entity68 , in the state of @entity67 where @entity7 is located , there is no law requiring the use of prophylactics and performers are not even required to undergo health checks			1
the fees required to get a permit are also much smaller			0
fellow producer @entity76 added : ' @entity7 is a fresh town , and it 's where people need the business			2
' @entity79 , a studio owner and film producer , works on a film set featuring a hospital bed in his new studio in @entity7 the @entity84 , which is taking place this week , showcases just how big the industry has now become in the city			1
here a photographer stashes his collection of images and signatures while apparently carrying a magazine copy of @entity93 @entity76 says that @entity7 , in town in which prostitution is legal and women can be ordered to hotel rooms for a minimal fee , was also less squeamish about his line of work than @entity102			2
sitting among child - sized desks in his classroom set , he said : ' they 're used to it here because they already kind of have it			0
figuring out how to make these things more cheaply wo n't include shooting in @entity46			0
' the studio sits in what was once another empty building on blighted @entity114 behind the town 's tourist corridor			0
local officials appear content with the arrangement and have no plans to pass additional rules			0
' it 's a legalized industry and properly regulated , so i do n't see it as a problem , ' said @entity68 commissioner @entity124			1
' i think the city and the county will benefit from any expansion of the film industry			0
' @entity7 is home to some major porn players , including @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and newcomer @entity135			2
as film makers look to cut costs @entity7 provides cheap hotel rooms , mansions and warehouses to use for shoots , charges less for permits , and worryingly does n't require performers to have health checks vegas has also been less squeamish about the arrival of adult stars as prostitution is already legal and women can be ordered to rooms for minimal fees several producers with top porn purveyor @entity154 are talking about moving to @entity7 , according to owner @entity156 , and enough porn stars have settled down in the area to supply all the extras a film could need , if not all the stars			1
@entity162 , owner of adult talent agency @entity163 , opened an office here last autumn			0
he estimates that 20 per cent of the industry will have moved to @entity7 by the end of the year			1
some contrarians believe the boom will eventually lead @entity68 to adopt the same regulations that are scaring the industry in @entity46			2
this september , the same group that championed the 2012 condom law started a similar campaign in @entity173			1
for now , concerns about an eventual condom showdown in the desert are not stopping producers from making investments			0
@entity76 has several producers coming through his studio this week			0
after that , he will turn his attention to repurposing the cave set featured in the high fantasy spoof ' @entity185 ' for another pornographic parody , based on @entity187			0
last year porn actors @entity189 and his girlfriend @entity191 revealed they both had @entity32 and condemned the industry for putting profit before the health of performers campaigners have also launched a condom campaign against the adult industry in @entity173 and industry insiders believe it will only be a matter of time before @entity7 is forced to follow suit the star of both films , @entity203 , a millennial porn icon who acted alongside @entity205 in ' @entity206 , ' said moving the industry to @entity7 is just a band aid			1
' the issue with running to @entity7 is it does n't actually fix anything , ' he said , taking refuge near a stairwell at the convention hall to avoid interruption by a constant stream of fans			1
' we should explain to the people who put that law in place why it 's unnecessary , and appeal it the same way any community would appeal any asinine law			0
' the controversial regulation was passed in 2012 after being championed by @entity226 , a former performer and hiv - sufferer , and following an industry shutdown in 2011 after another star contracted the virus - which causes @entity231			0
in 2013 there were three shutdowns in @entity8 after several more performers tested positive for the virus			2
performers @entity237 and his girlfriend @entity191 also went public with their joint diagnosis of @entity32 in order to condemn the adult industry as putting profit before the health of their performers			2
and in another damaging blow to the industry 's credibility a male performer was caught trying to book a webcam sex session with a female partner , only days after discovering he was infect with @entity32 .			0

since law was passed requests for @entity8 permits have dropped 95 per cent
@entity7 is now the preferred *destination* for film makers
hotels , mansions and warehouses are all cheaper to rent there
fees for permits are cheaper , and performers do n't need health checks
there is also no condom law in @entity68 , where @entity7 is situated
