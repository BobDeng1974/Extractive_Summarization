by @entity0 published : 12:39 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 13:46 est , 21 march 2013 a minister who opened his church to @entity4 worshippers told today how he has been hit by a barrage of abuse by internet users			1
@entity9 's @entity8 became the first church in the @entity11 to share their building with @entity4 after @entity13 saw members of a neighbouring mosque praying outside in the snow because of a lack of space			1
hundred of @entity4 now pray in the @entity21 's main hall and chapel every week , but the news has not been well received by some , who have taken to the church 's @entity25 page to attack the decision			1
@entity28 , right , said he would not be true to his faith if he did not offer to help his neighbours with their overcrowding problem one user said that the church was ' sharing @entity35 's table with @entity36 ' before others another predicted a ' flood ' of @entity4 moving to @entity21 to convert the church into a mosque and said @entity28 needed to be given the ' boot ' before it was too late			1
another posted : ' i would leave this so called " church "			1
@entity45 is @entity36 , and no @entity46			2
they ( the church ) have nothing to say about persecuted @entity50 , but invite @entity36 in			1
' we are dealing with evil people that bow down to @entity45 and lost their belief in @entity35 a long time ago			2
' the church 's facebook page was no longer available this afternoon			1
but today @entity28 said he would not sever his relationship with the nearby @entity59			2
he said : ' i keep seeing these @entity25 comments coming up on my email account , but i will not back down			2
we have developed a relationship with the mosque and we will not be breaking that up			2
sheikh @entity67 , left , and @entity13 , right , behind the altar at @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity21 , which is also being used as a place of worship for @entity4 ' these people have reacted spontaneously , but over time i hope they will change their minds			1
' there is a huge religious cultural gap between the two , and if it takes time for them to be brought together then that 's the way it is			2
' with our media culture these days one can easily make comments and respond to things instantaneously , you just have to live with it			2
' one user even criticised @entity28 for being a @entity86 to just be ' liked ' and said there was nothing ' courageous ' in his actions			0
@entity28 said : ' what governed my human response was the @entity93 teaching ' love your neighbour as yourself ' and that was honestly my first thought , ' i have to help them as a neighbour '			0
' @entity35 was n't one who wanted to be liked and i do n't expect people to like me or the @entity21 for what we do			1
we do n't go into this blindly , we go into this knowingly and we do n't go around trying to please people			0
' it was simply a gut feeling to let them in after seeing someone in the cold praying and i believe that prayer is never wrong			2
there is nothing wrong with making them comfortable			0
' @entity9 's @entity8 in @entity21 is believed to be the first in the @entity11 to share with muslims sheikh @entity67 of the @entity116 mosque said : ' what happens here is special and there should be no problem repeating this across the country			1
' the relationship is friendly and respectful			0
' @entity9 's is part of the @entity125 , which is part of the @entity127 and distinct from the @entity128 of @entity129			1
the bishop of aberdeen and @entity133 , the @entity131 dr @entity130 said that this relationship could be the start of a change in dynamics between the two faiths			0
dr @entity130 said : ' it would be good to think we can change the world			0
most of us most of the time feel we ca n’t so do n’t bother			0
' but sometimes , someone has a vision we can do something of global significance on a local scale			0
' this is what is happening between @entity9 ’s and the mosque in its grounds			1
' everyone can do something locally and if more were to do so then something big might just begin to happen globally			0
' sections of the church hall have been handed over to the mosque and the imam has led prayers in the chapel dr @entity130 said that the ' eyes of the world ' were now focused on the two faiths represented in the building on the city ’s @entity166			1
although the @entity169 regards @entity35 as the son of @entity46 , the @entity4 faith views him as a key prophet			0
even with differences like these , there can be a mutual respect , said dr @entity130			0
the relationship between the mosque and @entity9 ’s has developed over the past few years			1
on christmas eve 2010 both opened their doors for prayers , food and socialising			0
in 2011 , the church and mosque teamed up to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the @entity187			1
verses were read from both the @entity189 and the @entity190 to commemorate those who died			0
there have been cases of @entity50 allowing @entity4 to pray in their churches in parts of @entity187			0
in 2011 , two @entity197 churches were criticised for opening their doors to @entity4 groups			0
but @entity8 leaders believe the move in @entity21 is a first for the @entity11 .			1

internet users targeted @entity9 's @entity8 in @entity21
@entity116 mosque was too small to fit everyone
