a students ’ union has been accused of racism and sexism after banning white people and men from an event to promote equality			1
those studying at @entity9 , were invited to the students ’ union meeting to discuss ‘ diversifying the curriculum ’			1
but they were shocked when an organiser told white people and men ‘ not to come ’ as it was only open to @entity16 [ black and minority ethnic ] women			1
@entity19 , student union welfare and diversity officer at @entity22 in @entity23 , sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a ' diversity ' meeting the union eventually backed down after a backlash from students , one of whom described the exclusive policy as ‘ patronising beyond belief ’			1
the event , held on wednesday , was organised by welfare and diversity officer @entity19 , who said she hoped to persuade academics to broaden courses to include more material relating to minority groups			2
she wrote on @entity43 : ‘ invite loads of @entity45 and non-binary people ! ! also , if you ’ve been invited and you ’re a man and / or white @entity47 just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a @entity16 women and non-binary event only			2
’ non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female			0
miss @entity19 , 27 , added : ‘ do n’t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do ’ , followed by a wink			0
the event ’s online page said it was open to ‘ self - defining @entity16 women and non-binary people with gender identities that include “ woman ”			0
’ the ban on men and white students is surprising , since the organisers claim to promote ‘ zero tolerance ’ for ‘ all forms of prejudice , discrimination and oppression ’			1
a senior union member told student newspaper @entity79 that miss @entity19 ’s actions had made it ‘ very difficult ’ for male students			1
he said many white men felt they ‘ could not say anything for fear of retribution ’ , adding : ‘ for @entity83 to have the nerve to write this is patronising beyond belief			1
the irony that she thinks that they are diversifying the student community in the name of feminism and multiculturalism is laughable			2
’ the event sparked a fierce backlash on social media , with one user writing : ‘ is n’t this racism – and why was n’t she prosecuted ? ’ another said : ‘ hypocrisy of the left ... when will people see it			0
’ organisers later appeared to back down on the rules , with the statement ‘ allies now welcome ! ’ added to the meeting ’s @entity43 page			1
miss @entity19 recently graduated from @entity9 with an @entity113 in gender and media studies			0
she is understood to live with her mother @entity116 , 55 , father @entity117 , 57 , and sister @entity118 , 23 , in @entity119 in a £ 450,000 three - bedroom terrace			0
ms @entity19 appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this @entity43 post a notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped , stating : ' allies now welcome ! ' a spokesman for @entity9 said the university had no part in the decisions of the union , adding : ‘ we are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression , including racism , sexism or any other form of bigotry			1
‘ we have written to the students ’ union to express our concern			2
’ the union said : ‘ @entity144 places huge importance on equality and diversity			2
‘ it is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face			0
‘ the accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly			0
’ the @entity158 tried to contact miss @entity19 but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her @entity43 account			0
@entity9 has insisted the @entity161 is a separate organisation over which it has no control			0

after anger over the move , organisers backed down and *overturned* ban
