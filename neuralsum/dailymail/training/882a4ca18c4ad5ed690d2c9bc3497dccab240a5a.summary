yet the intricate and other - worldly detail belongs to something a bit closer to home - a golf ball			0
the unexpected bright centers found in something quite mundane have been documented by photographer @entity14			1
despite the rings of color , this is the inside of a golf ball and not a new planetary discovery a space oddity : mr @entity14 did not expect to find beauty in the middle of a golf ball photographer @entity14 decided to slice his golf ball collection in half to see what lies beneath the core of a golf ball affects how quickly it spins and how far it will fly through the air sheer curiosity led him to cut his golf ball collection in half to see what was inside			1
beneath the dimples lies the core of the ball , made from dough , which affects how quickly it spins and how far it can fly			2
there are strict rules on how golf balls are made , set by the @entity40 , based at the world 's oldest golf club in @entity43 , @entity44 , and they must not be heavier than 1.62oz			0
the dough , usually made from about a dozen raw ingredients , is color - coded depending on its intended effects on a golfer 's game			2
despite his collection , mr @entity14 , from @entity50 , @entity51 , is not a golfer himself			2
not every golf ball has a colorful interior , with some looking more futuristic than their bright counterparts the golf ball project made photographer @entity14 more excited about taking abstract pictures alongside his documentary work @entity14 was delighted to find ' elegant formal qualities ' in the most mundane of places - inside a golf ball beneath their plain exteriors , there 's a riot of color to be found and each color stands for a different impact the raspberry interior of this golf ball is created out of dough , which is blended from a dozen ingredients instead his pictures , which appear under the title @entity78 , have given him a new appreciation of photography beyond his award - winning real - life work			1
mr @entity14 , who gained his master 's degree at @entity85 , said : ' to my surprise , what i found inside inspired me to consider that i could discover , in the unlikeliest of places , elegant formal qualities and surprising metaphorical possibilities			0
' @entity78 has moved me to be enthusiastic about abstraction , an exciting corollary to my work as a documentary photographer			0
' quality : @entity97 sealed his first @entity99 victory - a tournament he has always been desperate to win the planet - like appearance of the insides of golf balls give a mundane object an other - worldly effect after being sliced in half , the dough sags in some , left , and holds its pattern perfectly in others , right it looks like a sun , and the right core in a ball could fire up a golfer 's game they 're small and lightweight but the core of a golf ball can have a significant impact on a golfer 's game mr @entity14 said he had a new appreciation for abstract photography at the end of his project			1
