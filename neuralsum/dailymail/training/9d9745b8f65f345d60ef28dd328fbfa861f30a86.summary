piercing the skyline and sprouting branch - like balconies , an apartment block resembling a giant tree is set to come to life in @entity6 , @entity7			1
aptly called the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , at 17 - storeys , the high - rise building embodies the capabilities of 21 century architecture			1
as its name suggests , the building 's unusual shape takes inspiration from the tree form , with endless stair - step balconies protruding off the building 's trunk - like core in the same way branches do on trees			2
appearing to grow out of the ground , the plans for the structure draw further comparisons to a tree			0
in addition to the balconies jutting off in different directions like branches , these will be complimented by functional decks that provide shade for adjoining units , thus creating a tree - like set of stairs that encase the building			1
tree in the sky : an apartment block unlike others , the building 's balconies are inspired by tree branches , which draw natural light and create an open atmosphere for vegetation construction on the mixed - use high - rise building is set to start in july next year , with completion expected by december 2017 the unique 56 - metre tall tower will feature 120 residential units and office space along with a restaurant , panoramic bar and art gallery			1
visitors and guests will be welcomed to the tower by the restaurant and gallery while the penthouse bar will offer views of the coastline and mountains			2
its design will invite vegetation on balconies to thrive due to the open atmosphere , which is ideal for plants			0
against the buildings white facade , this will create a vertical garden with bring colour and contrast			0
bringing life to the tree building , residents will have the impression they are outside when they are indoors by mixing the two settings			0
with the outdoors an important part of life in @entity6 , the structure 's balconies draw natural light , absorbing sunshine the same way leaves do			2
@entity95 reported the building 's architects were inspired by a tree 's efficient properties and the city 's tradition for outdoor living , hence the name @entity103 , which translates from @entity105 to @entity106 as @entity107			1
standing tall at 56 metres , the building will pierce the @entity6 skyline , with a penthouse bar offering spectacular views of the coast and nearby mountains offering 120 apartments , @entity107 will offer residents the chance to pick from various units with different floor plans due to structure 's unique form piercing the skyline , the building will be set between @entity6 's new and old districts , sitting halfway between newly developed districts @entity124 and @entity125 and the city center			1
from the building , residents will have easy access to nearby the pedestrian and cycling paths			0
it was announced in march that the 10,000 square metre @entity105 - designed building will be built by @entity135 architects and fittingly , the building will draw and blend influences from both countries			1
with a modular design , this allows the mixed - use building to feature many different layouts with stunning panoramic views of a nearby mountain range and the ocean			2
@entity146 reported this will allow residents to choose a floor plan from many varying layouts and encourage free choice architecture			0
the @entity8 will become @entity6 's second folly structure because if it 's extravagant form and ability to challenge the traditional notions of architecture a restaurant will greet people on the ground floor , while nearby pedestrian and cycle paths will encourage residents to connect with the environment but the project is getting attention for all the right reasons , after being dubbed the second architectural folly of the 21st century			1
part of @entity6 's plans to build 12 new follies across the city , @entity170 reported that it will join the first building that won a competition to be built			1
selected last year , with construction due to start this year , the 11 - storey holiday apartment building features curved and stack levels			2
an architectural folly is when a building 's purpose is considered to be for aesthetic pleasure			0
while the @entity186 building is still functional , it 's extravagant design and ability to challenge traditional notions of architecture help qualify it as an architectural folly			0
construction is set to start on the @entity186 in july 2015 and is expected to finished in december 2017			0
the 10,000 square metre @entity105 - designed building will be built by @entity135 architects and draw influences from both countries stunning : the tower will sit between @entity6 's new and old districts , spurting out of the ground like a giant tree with branch - like balconies in every direction folly : last april @entity204 won a competition to build the first folly building ( pictured ) in @entity6			1
