by @entity0 and @entity1 after @entity3 congressman @entity2 threatened to throw @entity5 reporter @entity4 off the @entity7 balcony last night he followed up his ferocious threats with a series of insults questioning the journalist 's masculinity			1
this has led @entity15 media and gossip site @entity16 to openly speculate whether the real reason former @entity19 and @entity20 agent @entity2 threatened the 35 - year - old political reporter was because he is gay			1
indeed , after threatening to throw @entity4 off the ' f * * * ing balcony ' , @entity2 seethed that he was going to break the reporter in half ' like a boy ' and then proceeded to torment him by claiming ' you 're not man enough			1
' according to @entity16 , who spoke to the reporter 's colleagues , it is well known among his friends that he is indeed gay			0
' within the station community it ’s pretty well known , ' one colleague told @entity16			0
the website poses the question : if @entity4 did n't ask @entity2 anything about his or anyone else 's sexuality , then why did the congressman fire back a stream of insults aimed at questioning the reporter 's masculinity			1
@entity16 claims that this is a ' common weapon of homophobes seeking to torment and marginalize gay men			0
' @entity16 makes the point that it is unclear if @entity2 was aware of @entity4 's sexuality at the time of their ugly spat			2
however , the two men have been involved in interviews repeatedly over the years			0
apology : @entity5 political reporter @entity4 takes a phone call from rep. @entity2 , @entity70 , in @entity71 on wednesday a day after @entity4 was threatened by @entity2 after president @entity72 's @entity29 ( left ) and ( right ) returns to work ' he and congressman @entity2 have worked together professionally for a while , ' @entity5 ’s @entity71 bureau chief @entity73 told @entity16			1
' but this is the first time @entity2 has said anything like this			2
' however , @entity4 's friends claimed that the argument had nothing at all to do with his sexuality			0
' it looked to me like old - school a * * holedom that had nothing to do with @entity2 being gay , ' argued a friend of his , who added - ' i ’d be surprised if @entity2 knew			2
' @entity73 added , ' i do n’t think that was a factor in the confrontation			0
' last night , @entity2 stormed off after @entity5 reporter @entity4 tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but returned to confront the tv news man			1
bully pulpit : rep @entity2 , a @entity97 from @entity98 , was being interviewed by @entity5 about the @entity29 address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him he squared up to @entity4 and told him ' you ever do that to me again i 'll throw you off this f * * * ing balcony ' before threatening to break @entity4 in half ' like a boy '			1
but today @entity2 said he had called @entity4 to apologize and said he ' overreacted ' when he threatened him with physical violence following the @entity29 address			1
@entity4 posted a message on @entity109 wednesday morning announcing the call , but it comes after @entity2 already defended his decision to ' take him to task ' after the reporter asked about an ongoing federal investigation into @entity2 's campaign finances			1
the incident was caught on camera , showing how @entity2 cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe			0
off - topic question : @entity5 political reporter @entity4 attempted to question @entity2 about the @entity20 investigation into his 2010 campaign fundraising , but the politician cut him off and refused to discuss the matter ‘ i 'm not speaking to you off - topic , this is only about the president , ’ said an irate @entity2 before stalking off			1
‘ so congressman @entity2 does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances , ’ @entity4 said into the camera			2
that is when @entity2 , 43 , marched back and confronted a startled - looking @entity4			1
although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low , a transcript provided by @entity5 shows that at one point @entity2 said to @entity140 : ' let me be clear to you , you ever do that to me again i 'll throw you off this f * * * ing balcony			2
’ the reporter attempted to defend himself , pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘ a valid question			0
’ in response , @entity2 told him : ' no , no , you 're not man enough , you 're not man enough			2
i 'll break you in half			0
’ in the wake of the incident , @entity2 released an unapologetic statement claiming that he was ‘ extremely annoyed ’ because he was doing @entity5 a favor by agreeing to do their interview first			2
‘ the reporter knew that i was in a hurry and was only there to comment on the @entity29 , but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap shot at the end of the interview , because i did not have time to speak off - topic , ’ @entity2 said			1
fit of rage : the 43 - year - old retired @entity19 and former @entity20 agent went after @entity140 , threatening to throw him off the balcony next step : hours after issuing a statement defending his decision to ' take him to task ' , @entity2 called the reporter and apologized he continued , saying : ‘ i verbally took the reporter to task and told him off , because i expect a certain level of professionalism and respect , especially when i go out of my way to do that reporter a favor			1
‘ i doubt that i am the first member of @entity180 to tell off a reporter , and i am sure i wo n’t be the last			0
’ he issued a second statement wednesday morning : ' i was wrong			0
i should n’t have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool			0
' ' i have apologized to @entity4 , which he graciously accepted , and will be scheduling a lunch soon			2

' earlier this month , the @entity20 charged @entity2 ’s donor @entity206 with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the @entity97 ’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $ 10,000			1
@entity2 , 47 , has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged			0
the @entity211 reported that the politician has faced an investigation into allegations that he or his campaign illegally asked for contributions from foreign donors			0
this is not the @entity220 's first threat of violence , as @entity222 reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a @entity226 nightclub more than a decade earlier			2
he allegedly said the man ' do n’t know who he ’s f * * * ing with ... i ’ll f * * * in ’ make him disappear where nobody will find him '			0
the confrontation continued into the club 's garage , where a @entity235 officer who was working at the club confronted then - @entity20 agent @entity2 after @entity2 was holding his gun and threatening the man			1
' i ’m gon na f * * * in ' kill him ... i ’m a fucking @entity20 agent , ai n’t nobody gon na threaten me , ’ @entity2 reportedly said			1

rep @entity2 , 43 , of @entity98 , told @entity5 political reporter @entity4 he will throw him off @entity7 balcony

the @entity97 has since called the reporter to apologize *personally*
not his first time threatening violence as he allegedly used his gun to threaten a man at a nightclub back when he was an off - duty @entity20 agent
@entity2 apologized on wednesday to @entity272 and the reporter accepted this
they are now set to go for lunch next week
