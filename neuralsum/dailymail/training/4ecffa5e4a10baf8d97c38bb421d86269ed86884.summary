by @entity0 published : 19:15 est , 10 november 2012 @entity2 : 21:05 est , 10 november 2012 a successful lawyer working for a high - profile law firm recently turned in a departure memo saying that she could no longer juggle her work and family responsibilities			1
the woman , identified only as mrs x , wrote a heart - wrenching email to her co-workers at law firm @entity13 in @entity14 , spelling out her 20 - hour days filled with stress , spit - up , and sine qua nons			1
her letter , obtained by blog @entity21 , spells out a typical day for the working mother , which begins at 4am and did n’t end until 1:30am the next day , punctuated with long commutes , meetings , and parenting duties that go well into the night			1
having it all ? one lawyer in @entity14 wrote in a resignation email that she could no longer do 20 - hour days juggling work and family ( stock photo ) mrs @entity33 begins her departure memo with a play - by - play of how she spent a typical day , starting at 4am with checking in on her crying child , and ending only after hours of exhausting meetings , commuting children to and from daycare , and answering thousands of emails on her @entity41			1
by 7:30am , the working mother had already made her children breakfast , dressed them , and changed the sheets of her young son , who wet the bed			1
she writes : ‘ realize that i am still in my pajamas and have n’t showered , so pull my hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit			2
’ she wo n't have the chance to shower until 1:30 the next morning			2
then , mrs @entity33 writes , it ’s time for the daily commute , complete with congestion and her infant child spitting up on her suit			2
by 9:20 , she manages to get her children to daycare , gets to the office , and dials in five minutes late to a conference call			0
from that point on , her day is a blur of client calls , meetings , endless to - do lists , and of course , emails			1
at 2pm , she explains : ‘ realize i forgot to eat lunch , so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers			0
’ only a half hour later , she receives a ‘ frantic ’ email from one of her clients demanding an answer to a question that day			1
mrs @entity80 writes that she has to pick up her children from daycare by 5:30pm			0
for every minute late , she must pay $ 5 per child			0
following a 5:50pm pickup , the frazzled mother faces rush - hour traffic and her two children hungry and screaming in the back of the vehicle			1
all work and no play : the mother , mrs x , worked at the @entity14 branch of @entity13 by 7:15 , she makes a quick dinner of microwaved chicken nuggets for her family , bathes her children ( after losing a negotiation with her husband ) , and puts them to bed			1
but her day is far from over			0
after the children are asleep , she checks emails and does even more work			0
at one point , she dozes off and makes coffee			0
she manages to find time to shower at 1am ( ‘ lord knows i wo n’t have time in the morning , ’ she writes ) , and is asleep by 1:30			0
the memo then says : ‘ repeat			1
’ argument : the question of whether women can have it all was famously questioned by @entity113 in the july / august issue of the @entity115 mrs @entity80 then wrote that she ‘ truly admires all of you that have been able to juggle your career and family and do not envy what a challenge it is trying to do each well			1
’ @entity21 ’s @entity124 observed that maintaining such a gruelling schedule day to day is simply impossible			0
‘ you ’ve got to keep going back and forth , not just in terms of where you are , but also in terms of your focus , ’ she wrote			0
mrs @entity33 ’s time - crunch dilemma is part of a much larger topic that touches on a buzz - worthy subject – if the working woman can ‘ have it all			2
’ the @entity137 ’s @entity136 wrote that especially in law , the workplace is ‘ a 1950s model set in a 2012 world , ’ requiring workers to put in extreme hours ‘ with no distractions , because there is someone ( traditionally a wife ) at home to sort out the rest of their lives			0
’ ms @entity136 goes on to say that this model is intrinsically flawed , as the new model is that of a dual - income household , with both parents working out of necessity			2
that leaves women - the traditional caregiver - dual responsibility			2
the @entity115 ’s @entity159 stoically rejected that a work - life balance was possible for working moms in the much - debated cover story from the july / august issue of the magazine			2
ms @entity113 worked as a high - profile government official but noted in the article she had little time for her family			1
‘ i still strongly believe that women can “ have it all ” ( and that men can too ) , ’ she wrote			0
’ but not today , not with the way @entity174 ’s economy and society are currently structured			0
' my experiences over the past three years have forced me to confront a number of uncomfortable facts that need to be widely acknowledged — and quickly changed			0
’ @entity181 ( and many others here , i presume ) : 4:00am : hear baby screaming , hope i am dreaming , realize i ’m not , sleep walk to nursery , give her a pacifier and put her back to sleep 5:30am : alarm goes off , hit snooze 6:00am : see the shadow of a small person standing at my bedroom door , realize it is my son who has wet the bed ( time to change the sheets ) 6:15am : hear baby screaming , make a bottle , turn on another excruciating episode of @entity203 , feed baby 7:00am : find some clean clothes for the kids , get them dressed 7:30am : realize that i am still in my pajamas and have n’t showered , so pull hair back in a ponytail and throw on a suit 8:00am : pile into the car , drive the kids to daycare 9:00am : finally arrive at daycare , baby spits up on suit , get kids to their classrooms , realize i have a conference call in 15 minutes 9:20am : run into my office , dial - in to conference call 5 minutes late and realize that no one would have known whether or not i was on the call , but take notes anyway 9:30am : get an email that my time is late , @entity228 ! enter my time 10:00am : team meeting ; leave with a 50 - item to - do list 2:00pm : realize i forgot to eat lunch , so go to the 9th floor kitchen to score some leftovers 5:00pm : receive conflicting comments from senior associate and partner ( one in new version and one in track changes ) ; attempt to reconcile ; send redline 5:30pm : wait for approval to send response to client ; realize that i am going to be late picking up the kids from daycare ( $ 5 for each minute late ) 6:00pm : race to daycare to get the kids ( they are the last two there ) 6:30pm : traffic with a side of screaming kids who are starving 7:15pm : finally arrive home , throw chicken nuggets in the microwave , feed the family 7:45pm : negotiate with husband over who will do bathtime and bedtime routine ; lose 8:00pm : @entity257 , pajamas , books , bed 9:00pm : kids are finally asleep , check blackberry and have 25 unread messages 11:30pm : wake up and realize i fell asleep at my desk ; make more coffee ; get through task number three 1:00am : jump in the shower ( lord knows i wo n’t have time in the morning ) 1:30am : finally go to bed repeat			1
