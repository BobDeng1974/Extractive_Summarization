sonar scans have shown that the mysterious object could be a huge @entity3 anti-submarine weapon lost beneath the waves since @entity5 divers exploring a ' @entity8 - shaped ' object in the @entity9 say that the strange , curved object might be a @entity3 device lost beneath the waves since the end of the @entity5			1
sonar scans have shown that the device , raised 10ft above the seabed and measuring 200ft by 25ft , could be the base of an anti-submarine weapon			1
the weapon was built with wire mesh which could have baffled submarine radar , leading enemy craft to crash - much in the same way as turning out a lighthouse could be used as a weapon against shipping			1
but now former @entity27 naval officer and @entity5 expert @entity26 has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block @entity33 and @entity34 submarine movements in the area			1
the huge steel - and - concrete structure could be one of the most important historical finds in years			0
@entity39 claims it would have been built of double - skinned concrete and reinforced with wire mesh to baffle radar - which could explain why the dive team 's equipment repeatedly failed near the mystery object			1
‘ the area was vital to the @entity49 war machine because most of the ball bearings for its tanks and trucks came from here			1
without them the @entity49 army would have ground to a halt , ’ explained one expert			2
‘ this device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery , ’ they added			0
explorer @entity63 - who is studying the images for the @entity72 diving team - agreed : ‘ it is a good candidate for the answer to this mystery			2
the object lies directly underneath a shipping route			0
’ ‘ it would be of enormous weight in steel and concrete			0
other @entity3 anti-sub anchoring devices were nowhere near as large , ’ he added			2
while the @entity80 team is understandably excited about their potentially earth - shattering find , others are slightly more sceptical and are questioning the accuracy of the sonar technology			2
' this device dwarfs anything ever found before and is an important weapons discovery , ' said the dive team which discovered the strange structure but now former @entity27 naval officer and @entity5 expert @entity26 has revealed that the structure - measuring 200ft by 25ft - could be the base of a device designed to block @entity33 and @entity34 submarine movements in the area landing spot : the exact coordinates of the object have not been released , but it is confirmed to be somewhere at the bottom of the @entity100 in the @entity9 between @entity101 and @entity27 @entity27 submarine officer , @entity26 says that the most likely explanation is that the object is a @entity49 submarine trap from the @entity5			1
these huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for @entity109 submarines			0
speaking to the @entity27 newspaper @entity110 , @entity26 said that similar concrete structures had been built by the @entity33 during @entity112 says it is likely that the object is built from double - skinned concrete for the purpose of holding large steel wire mesh structures , expected to disturb the propagation of radar and other signals used by any nearby submarines			1
during the decades after the war , the wire mesh structures would have eroded away , leaving only the holes shown on the images provided by @entity126 , a member of the @entity72 research team states that @entity39 ' theory is a good candidate for the answer to the mystery			2
' the object looks like as it has been formed by pouring , layer by layer			0
it is believable also because the object is located in the middle of a ship route '			0
these huge concrete structures were built to make navigation more difficult for @entity109 submarines ( pictured ) the @entity27 team exploring the structure have been plagued with problems			0
the divers exploring a ' @entity8 - shaped ' object at the bottom of the @entity9 said that team their equipment stops working when they approach within 200m			1
professional diver @entity148 , part of the @entity72 team which is exploring the anomaly , said some of the team 's cameras and the team 's satellite phone would refuse to work when directly above the object , and would only work once they had sailed away			1
the divers exploring a ' @entity8 - shaped ' object at the bottom of the @entity9 say their equipment stops working when they approach within 200m			1
professional diver @entity148 , part of the @entity72 team which is exploring the anomaly , said some of the team 's cameras and the team 's satellite phone would refuse to work when directly above the object , and would only work once they had sailed away			1
he is quoted as saying : ' anything electric out there - and the satellite phone as well - stopped working when we were above the object			0
' and then we got away about 200 meters and it turned on again , and when we got back over the object it did n’t work			0
' hefty trajectory : the @entity27 diving team noted a 985 - foot flattened out ' runway ' leading up to the object , implying that it skidded along the path before stopping but no true answers are clear the team did get some pictures , such as these soot - covered rocks that encircled an egg - shaped hole which went into the object at its center , and have no idea what any of it means no clarification : the divers made their sonar discovery public but waited a year to make the dive because they had to gather enough funding and base off of weather conditions the sonar picture of the unidentified object resembles the famed @entity195 ship the @entity196 the object was first found in may last year , but because of a lack of funding and bad timing , they have were not able to pull a team together to see for themselves - just the strange , metallic outline , and a similar disk - shaped object about 200 metres away			1
during their visit , the team saw a 985 - foot trail that they described ' as a runway or a downhill path that is flattened at the seabed with the object at the end of it '			1
as it was before the recent dive , the story behind the object is anyone 's guess , from a ' plug to the inner world ' to the @entity196 ship from @entity195			2
in the past , such technology has confused foreign objects with unusual - but natural - rock formations			0
part of the trouble they face , however , is that they have no way of telling what is inside the supposed cylinder - whether it is filled with gold and riches or simply aged sediment particles			0
they 're hoping for the former , and history seems to be in their favour			0
the @entity9 is a treasure trove for shipwreck hunters , as an estimated 100,000 objects are thought to line the cold sea 's floor			0
the company have created a submarine that they hope will appeal to tourists and wannabe shipwreck hunters who will pay to take a trip down to the bottom of the @entity9 to see for themselves			0
a further dive will take place in the coming weeks			0
the @entity80 team 's sonar pictures show that the object is a massive cylinder with a 60 metre diameter and a 400 metre - long tail deep in the @entity9			1
a similar disk - shaped object was also found about 200 metres away unidentified treasure : shipwreck divers are perplexed by the oddly - shaped object that they found at the bottom of the @entity9 tourist trips : diver @entity267 is hoping to take wealthy tourists down in this submarine to see the object			2

object is raised about 10 to 13ft above seabed and curved at the sides like a *mushroom*
@entity5 expert says object may be @entity3 anti-submarine weapon
wire meshes could be used to baffle submarine radar and make them crash
area vital to @entity49 war machine
object has wire meshes - which could explain why dive team 's equipment failed
divers say phones and some cameras *switch* off when close to the object
