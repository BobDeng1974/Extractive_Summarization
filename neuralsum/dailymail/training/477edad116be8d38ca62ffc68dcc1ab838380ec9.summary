by @entity1 reporter published : 16:06 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 28 july 2013 a baby bottle that heats milk as it is being drunk has sparked a huge amount of interest on parenting forums – but not everyone is convinced			2
the @entity10 - designed @entity9 features a warmer in the top of the bottle , containing the same gel found in hand - warmers			1
milk flows through a network of grooves on the outside of the warmer			0
new invention : @entity9 only warms milk as it is being consumed - meaning the rest stays fresh when it reaches the teat , it has been heated to @entity26 – the same temperature as breast milk			1
only milk being consumed is warmed , meaning the rest stays fresh			2
designer @entity31 came up with the idea after his wife became exasperated that milk she had previously expressed into a bottle had to be thrown away if had been warmed up but was then left unused			1
the warmer stays at the optimum temperature for up to an hour , after which it must be ‘ recharged ’ , usually by being placed in a steam steriliser for 25 minutes			0
however , one blogger , @entity42 , points out that convenience does n’t come cheap			0
the warmer can be recharged only 150 times , and the blogger estimates that parents would need to spend £ 32 a month on the product			0
other parents say their children do n’t seem to care whether milk is warm or not			0
still , with @entity10 sales of @entity9 in excess of 15,000 a year and rising , the product has legions of fans : ‘ perfect temperature straight from the fridge – what more could a busy mum want ? ’ wrote one online reviewer			2
