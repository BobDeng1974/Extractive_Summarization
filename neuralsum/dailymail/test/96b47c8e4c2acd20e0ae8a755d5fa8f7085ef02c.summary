@entity1 boss @entity0 hailed the ' belligerent , stubborn and hard working ' qualities of his ' horrible bunch ' of players after a determined 1 - 1 draw at his former club @entity6 moved @entity7 closer to securing a place in the @entity10 play - offs			1
despite @entity6 bouncing back to take a point through @entity14 's 31st goal of the season in the 50th minute after a @entity17 own goal had given @entity1 a first - half lead , @entity7 's play - off hopes are now in their own hands with two games remaining			1
former @entity6 boss @entity0 was delighted with his side 's determined display and he said : ' it was a good performance and a good point			1
@entity0 's @entity1 were denied three points as rivals @entity6 fought back to draw 1 - 1 on saturday ' @entity6 were in the ascendancy in the second half but we have had a great , stubborn , belligerent , professional performance - all those horrible words people do n't like in football but i do because you win games and win leagues by doing that			1
' we are always hard to beat and hard to play against			0
' the first thing i said to the players in the dressing room after the game was what a belligerent , stubborn , hard working , tough , horrible bunch you have turned out to be and i love you and i am proud of you because you need all those qualities to be a good team			1
it is lovely to have			0
' a lot of those qualities are probably the reasons why we are where we are			2
' it takes a lot of things to be in the top six and there will be teams below us who are all playing sexy football but we are winning games and we are in the top six and we still have a chance of being promoted			0
' so to anyone who cocks a snook at the way we are doing it i laugh at them and think it is comical because i think what we do we do well and is n't that what having a job is all about ? ' @entity77 's header ( right ) rebounds off @entity6 defender @entity17 for an own goal @entity0 , who was sacked by @entity6 in february 2012 after almost six years in charge of the club , insisted that he did not have anything to prove on his second return to @entity83			1
he added : ' i think i am very much liked and respected by the @entity6 fans and i love the club and the people here so i do n't think i have got anything to prove and i always appreciate getting a nice warm welcome coming back			1
' but i have taken the point and i am happy with that			0
' although they trailed at the break , @entity6 needed only five minutes of the second period to draw level when @entity14 stabbed home at the far post and they could have gone on to snatch a winner with @entity97 carrying their greatest			1
@entity0 hails the ' belligerent , stubborn and hard working ' qualities of his ' horrible bunch ' of @entity1 players they could not find a second goal , though , and their play - off hopes are now hanging by a thread			1
however , coach @entity104 insisted they will not be throwing in the towel			0
he said : ' it is out of our hands and now we will need to win our final two games and other teams will need to lose			0
but you do n't know what will happen			0
so we need to make sure that we go again next week			0
' it is a tough call , we understand that			0
we will have to see how the table looks but one way or another we have to put in a good performance and give it everything we have got next week at @entity120			0
@entity104 is still hopeful his @entity6 side can secure a @entity10 play - off spot despite the 1 - 1 draw ' if the door is still open through other people slipping up we have to make sure that we are there			1
' he added : ' we gave it everything against @entity1			2
i thought that we showed a lot of spirit , effort and energy in the second half when we pushed @entity1 all the way			2
the attitude and tempo was there			0
' ' ultimately it is a better point for @entity1 than it is for us			2
we needed to win and i felt that we built up very well in the second half			0
we got a goal back early on but could n't break down a very determined and well organised and resolute @entity1 defence			1
' the number of times that they got blocks in was high and for us not to break them down in that period was our undoing so i am disappointed with the draw			2
we needed three points but @entity1 are very , very resolute			2

@entity1 denied three points as @entity6 fight back to draw 1 - 1 on saturday
