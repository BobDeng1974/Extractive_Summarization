@entity0 , 34 , dreaded having to get dressed up after giving birth to her second child			1
she 'd had no problem getting back to a size 10 after the birth of her first child , @entity10 , three years ago			0
but after having her daughter @entity12 18 months later , her ' mummy tummy ' simply would n't shift			1
instead , she remained at her peak weight of 13 stone for more than a year , despite trips to the gym three times a week			1
she believes she was a victim of ‘ second baby syndrome ’ whereby it is far harder to shift excess fat from the abdomen because a woman ’s stomach muscles are weakened by the rigours of giving birth in quick succession			1
@entity0 , who lives with her husband @entity27 and children in @entity29 , near @entity30 , said : ‘ i had two children quite quickly			1
‘ i had always prided myself on staying in shape and having a great figure but after the second birth there was nothing i could do to shift my mummy tummy			1

it was classic “ second baby syndrome			2
” ‘ i think your body changes so much by having children so quickly together			0
’ mrs @entity0 lost three stone in four months while taking the @entity48 diet pills she added : ‘ it was also hard to be really disciplined when i had two small kids to look after			1
‘ i would be snacking quite a bit during the day because there was n’t time always to eat healthily			0
‘ my stomach was still protruding and i was not at all happy with my figure			0
i could n’t bear to go on nights out because i feared someone at a bar or club would say , “ when is the baby due ? ” – even though i ’d given birth nearly a year before			2
‘ all my friends would still be wearing their tight going - out clothes and i was wearing loose baggy tops to cover my tummy			2
‘ i did n’t feel sexy at all			0
i started to get really depressed and feared that i might not ever get my figure back again			0
’ @entity0 had read about how @entity66 and @entity67 had both used @entity48 diet pills to keep in shape in the @entity70 raspberry ketones are fragrant compounds that occur naturally in raspberries and a number of other fruits			1
before taking the pills ( left ) @entity0 dreaded going out in case people thought she was still pregnant			1
now ( right ) , she is confident enough to pose in a bikini after taking the pills @entity0 felt sufficiently confident to wear a bikini while on a family holiday in @entity81 they were hailed as a ‘ miracle ’ diet cure after being featured on the popular @entity70 medical show @entity86 – and immediately sold out across the @entity70 and @entity87			1
they are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising			0
it is believed the pills may also boost levels of a hormone called adiponectin , which regulates metabolism			2
higher levels of this hormone are associated with fewer fat stores			0
@entity0 , who took @entity105 , claims they had an immediate effect and within four months of taking them she had shifted her dreaded ‘ mummy tummy ’ and lost three stone in weight			1

despite going to the gym three times a week , @entity0 struggled to shift her ' mummy tummy ' after the birth of @entity12 ( pictured ) she added : ‘ there is no doubt that the pills made all the difference			1
i had tried everything to shift my “ mummy tummy ” and at one point was going to the gym three times a week			1
' ‘ but it was so difficult to diet and bring up the kids properly at the same time and i need a bit of extra help			2
‘ the pills only work really effectively if you combine them with exercise and a good diet – but they give me the impetus to get all elements of my life into order			1
‘ i do n’t drink tea or coffee so i would really notice the energy boost when i took them			0
it was nothing strong – just a little pep up			0
' but it was especially what i needed – particularly in the afternoons which were the time of day when i would have starting snacking			0
’ @entity0 ’s confidence surged as she got back to her ideal weight			2
