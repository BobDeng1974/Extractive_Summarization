by @entity1 reporter most people probably would like to assume that if they were awoken at 6:30 in the morning by a drunk , naked stranger in their bedroom - who 'd just smeared his own feces throughout their house and tried to flood their kitchen - that the intoxicated intruder would be arrested when police ultimately show up			1
that , however , was not the case for a couple in @entity13 , @entity14 , who say that exact scenario played out in their home earlier this month - in their case , they say responding officers did n't arrest the drunken poop - smearer , they only cited him for a misdemeanor and let him go home			1
