by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 19:53 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 09:01 est , 4 january 2014 @entity2 has replaced @entity3 as favourite to become the next @entity6 leader , according to a poll of party members			0
the survey by influential grassroots website @entity11 reveals the home secretary has beaten the @entity14 mayor into pole position for the first time , after a series of tough interventions on immigration			1
of the 800 @entity6 members polled last month , 22.7 per cent said mrs may should be the party ’s next leader , just ahead of mr @entity3 on 22.6 per cent			1
after a series of interventions on immigration , @entity2 ( left ) has beaten the @entity14 mayor for the first time other contenders include the education secretary @entity27 , who has repeatedly ruled himself out , on 17 per cent and former leadership contender @entity28 on 11 per cent			1
despite the economic recovery , just 7 per cent of @entity29 believe chancellor @entity31 should succeed @entity32			1
but the most startling finding in the poll , one of a regular series by the website , is the growing support for mrs may whose proportion of the vote has never previously risen above the mid-teens			2
@entity42 , a former @entity6 mp who edits @entity11 , said the results were ‘ rather surprising ’ , given the government ’s problems over immigration			1
he added : ‘ the best explanation is that may ’s reputation as an effective , focused and no - nonsense minister continues to grow among party members			0
’ the prime minister 's satisfaction rating remains at 21 per cent mrs may is regarded as having had a good year , culminating in the deportation of hate preacher @entity54 in july last year			0
she has also flaunted her right - wing credentials with a number of toughly worded interventions on immigration and human rights			2
the home secretary has refused to rule out standing for leadership in the future , while stressing that she remains loyal to the prime minister			1
the emergence of mrs may as a serious challenger is a significant setback for mr @entity3 , who has spent years courting party activists			0
it follows controversy in november when he suggested that attempts to tackle inequality were ‘ futile ’ because some people were simply not bright enough to ever get ahead in life			0
delivering the annual @entity75 lecture in @entity14 , mr @entity3 also hailed the ‘ spirit of envy ’ – comments which drew widespread criticism			0
the survey of party members also revealed that mr @entity27 and the work and pensions secretary @entity82 remain the most popular cabinet ministers , with net satisfaction ratings of 83 per cent and 76 per cent			1
satisfaction with mr @entity31 rose dramatically last year as the economy recovered – up to 58 compared to a rating of minus one 12 months ago			0
but the prime minister ’s satisfaction rating remains at just 21 per cent			0
mr @entity42 said : ‘ while @entity32 takes the flak for what members see as the leadership ’s errors – @entity96 and @entity97 entry , onshore wind farms , same - sex marriage , the growth of @entity101 , compromises with the @entity103 – @entity31 takes the credit for the recovering economy			2
