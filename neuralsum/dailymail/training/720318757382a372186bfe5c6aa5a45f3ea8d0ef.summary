by @entity0 last updated at 8:46 am on 27th october 2011 @entity1 is to reopen tomorrow , a week after it closed because of anti-capitalist protesters – but its dome and galleries will remain shut			1
church officials did a u-turn after locking the cathedral doors for the first time since the @entity10 as the number of tents in the ramshackle camp in its churchyard doubled to 200			1
the move came as the @entity16 announced that it is about to begin legal action to evict the demonstrators			1
the decision to shut @entity1 ’s last friday is believed to have cost the cathedral more than £ 100,000 in lost tourist revenue			1
officials blamed it on health and safety concerns caused by the camp , which included fire hazards and the spread of rats because of poor hygiene among the demonstrators			1
but the @entity33 , the right reverend @entity34 , said yesterday that the crypt and ground floor areas should reopen tomorrow afternoon after protesters agreed to move tents near one of the entrances back by 10ft , which cleared fire escape routes			1
do not pass go : protesters have been whiling away the hours playing monopoly outside @entity1 he said : ‘ the staff here have been working flat out with the police , fire brigade and health and safety officers to try to ensure that we have confidence in the safety of our worshippers , visitors and staff which will allow us to reopen			1
being a full - time protester might sound exciting but day - to - day it can get , well , a bit dull			1
so to pass the time demonstrators outside @entity1 have acquired a giant @entity63 board to help them wile away the hours			1
it is believed that street artist @entity65 is behind the art installation at the occupy @entity69 movement 's camp who delivered it to the protest as a gift			1
the three dimensional depiction of the famous board includes mr @entity75 begging with his top hat and the playing pieces include a sports car to represent the bankers			1
the board also includes names of places where other occupy protests are being hosted			1
in addition there is a red plastic house adorned with the @entity89 tag which could represent toxic mortgage lending which triggered the financial meltdown in @entity92 , or it might be a reference to recently convicted graffiti artist ' we have wide statutory obligations to ensure the safety of our staff , congregation , visitors and pilgrims and final checks will be made tomorrow			1
' a passageway allowing evacuation procedures to be improved has been created ; the kitchen providing food for those in the camp has been moved from close proximity to the building ; bicycles chained to the railings have been shifted and a clear pathway restored			1
' but he said that ‘ for the time being ’ the galleries and 365ft high dome will remain closed because large fire engines would still struggle to get to @entity1 ’s in an emergency , a decision which is likely to continue to hit the cathedral ’s tourist trade			1
he added : ' we will revisit the risk assessment in the light of any overnight developments and subject to us getting the green light we hope to reopen in time for the @entity129 on friday to which everyone is welcome			1
' ‘ we reiterate our basic belief in the right to protest as well as requesting that those living in the tents now leave the site peacefully			2
' we want the site to be fully open to members of the public to have open access over the area as well as for those wanting to visit @entity1 's			2
' the mission of the cathedral is committed to the @entity145 message of justice , dignity and peace			2
the debate about social justice and economic policy will remain at the heart of the work of the @entity154			2
' the board has large scale models of playing pieces , including a sports car ( to represent bankers ) and a red plastic house with a @entity89 tag sprayed onto it to represent the toxic mortgages that started the recession it is believed that street artist @entity65 is behind the @entity63 art installation at the @entity168 movement 's camp the decision to attempt to reopen the @entity1 comes after the @entity170 called on the protesters to leave			1
@entity172 , the third most senior cleric in the @entity173 , said in a statement : ' the time has come for the protesters to leave , before the camp 's presence threatens to eclipse entirely the issues that it was set up to address			2
' the @entity180 and the @entity181 , who are responsible for @entity1 's , have already made clear that the protest should come to an end and i fully support that view			2
' the closure of @entity1 ’s descended into farce after the @entity188 revealed that the camp was made up of part - time protesters and is virtually deserted at night			2
@entity191 said he was optimistic that the @entity1 would reopen following changes to the layout of tents used by anti-capitalist protesters there had been growing calls for it to reopen after visitors noted that the camp was not blocking the steps to its main entrance			2
the @entity16 said it expected to announce plans for legal action to evict the protesters following a meeting tomorrow			0
@entity1 ’s declined to comment on whether it would join the legal action , but the corporation has always said it would not start court proceedings alone because the camp straddles land belonging to both groups			0
@entity213 protest : just three tents are occupied , as shown by the yellow and red from the thermal imaging camera			0
behind , similar colours highlight warmer shops and their windows			0
empty tents are in purple returning to life : same view of the camp looking busier in daylight yesterday the cathedral was last closed in september 1940 – for four days – after a time - delayed @entity229 bomb crashed through its south - west tower			0
yesterday @entity231 , believed to be the last remaining member of the bomb disposal team that cleared the device , called for the protesters to leave the site			0
mr @entity231 , 90 , from @entity237 , said : ‘ i believe in the right to peaceful protest , but i also believe in respect and i do not believe these protesters are showing it			0
’ this image was taken at about 1am this morning , showing considerably more activity than when the thermal images were taken			0
the bright light is from the floodlit shops of @entity247 security : a dog stands guard at the entrance to a tent near the cathedral steps at the front of the occupation camp the former royal engineer was just 19 when he took part in the operation which saved the cathedral from obliteration			0
‘ i ca n’t pretend it was n’t frightening , ’ he said			0
after deactivating the bomb , the team took it to @entity266 where it was detonated , leaving a 100ft crater			0
@entity268 , an @entity168 spokeswoman , said : ' the overriding principle is a civil liberties one			0
the right to protest and participate in politics in a free society is sacrosanct			0
tent city : a couple walk by the damp protest shanty town last night , lit by the glare of the street lights ' we are very keen to work with @entity1 's and the @entity16 to address their concerns			0
the channels of communication from our perspective are always open			0
' it would be a shame if the @entity16 were to launch legal action against a democratic and entirely peaceful protest when it 's entirely unnecessary			0
' we are concerned that any move to evict us could be the result of a political decision not related to health and safety and that would be very worrying			0
' @entity294 , who has previously been shortlisted for @entity295 by campaign group justice , said he would defend the protesters free of charge in any legal action .			0
