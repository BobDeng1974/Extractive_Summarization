@entity13 , 46 , was planning to use the machine after he got through to the second round of the @entity17 talent show			1
but it went missing from storage in @entity21 , @entity22 , after a row with his nephew @entity24 , 26 , over £ 3,500 unpaid wages , it was said			1
the @entity27 performing on the @entity28 before the act went missing @entity24 took the ' wheel of @entity8 ' machine to the scrap yard - selling it for just £ 585 then sold his uncle ’s @entity35 van on @entity37 to a man in @entity39 for £ 2,500 , the court heard			1
it emerged @entity13 had originally paid £ 3,000 for the act but then added to it adapting it through the years , spending a further £ 3,500			1
the fallout occurred last november after @entity45 - born @entity13 employed @entity24 to help run his circus act in which three acrobats walk , skip and jump on a set of triple revolving wheels whilst blindfolded			1
@entity50 heard @entity13 spent his winters in @entity45 and summers touring around @entity52 attending agricultural shows , outdoor shows and festivals with his death - defying act			1
@entity57 , pictured left leaving @entity50 is accused of stealing @entity58 , worth £ 29,000 , from his uncle , @entity13 , pictured right also leaving court the wheel of @entity8 is a steel construction of two or three wheels connected by spokes which revolve at high speeds he would occasionally get bookings over @entity68 and @entity69 and @entity24 was paid per event but during 2010 business began to slump and @entity13 fell behind paying wages			1
@entity13 told the jury : ' i have been doing it since 1984			2
@entity24 is my sister ’s son			2
i brought him over in 2005 , i trained him up with the hope eventually , one day , he would take over from me			0
' i was hoping to keep it in the family , i was hoping to pass it to the next generation			0
' i paid him £ 250 for each performing day and he took care of his own tax situation			2
' in the recession , in 2009 , bookings were hard to come by and i was struggling a bit , i was in some debt in @entity45 as well			0
the wheel of @entity8 went missing from its storage location in @entity21 in november last year @entity13 bought the wheel of @entity8 in 1984 and has been touring with it ever since ' i asked if i could pay him back at a later stage			1
' 2010 was worse : i went to work in a traveling circus in @entity91 because there were no bookings			0
in 2011 he worked with me from april 25 to july 9			0
i terminated it ( his contract )			0
' a booking on a triple wheel came up , there was a guy i was using that he did n’t like - but there was a contract			0
i told him it does n’t matter whether you like him or not , i need to make sure i fulfil the contract			0
' he eventually did agree but ( he ) said only if he could work the rest of the season and i said as long as you are clean - shaven , but he refused			0
' @entity13 returned to @entity45 in the second week of september last year , putting his van and equipment into storage in @entity21 , whilst @entity24 remained in @entity52			1
@entity57 denies two charges of theft in relation to the disappearance of the wheel of death @entity13 said that the recession led to a decline in bookings for the wheel of death he said he had been in touch with the man managing the storage to say they would be back in the beginning of the @entity68 to practice because they had gone through to the second round of @entity5 ’s @entity4			1
@entity13 said he bought the van in july 2011 for £ 2,750 and had bought the wheel of death in 1987			1
he said the only communication he had with @entity24 since last july was an email saying that he would clear the debts with any bookings he got , which included the @entity136 grand prix			0
@entity13 said he had already repaid his nephew £ 1,100 , through £ 100 pay outs and still owed him £ 1,300			1
he has since bought another wheel of death from @entity141 at £ 5,500 and was still paying it off			2
the truck has been returned to him after police tracked it down a short time afterwards			0
@entity24 denies two charges of theft			0
@entity148 prosecuting said : ' he accepted that he took it but he felt like he was entitled to do so because he had no money			2
' ' the question is his honesty			0
he says he was entitled to do so , or he believed he was entitled to do so - the crown say he told lies that he must ’ve known that he was not entitled to scrap this piece of equipment or sell the van to some innocent third party down in @entity39			2
