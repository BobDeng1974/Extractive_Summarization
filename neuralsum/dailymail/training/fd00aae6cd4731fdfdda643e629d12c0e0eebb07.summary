one month ago , @entity0 languished eight points behind @entity2 in the @entity3 and appeared to be on the point of @entity6 elimination			1
some supporters might have wondered about the future of their likeable coach @entity9			1
fast forward , however , and @entity12 ’s last - minute winner against @entity13 is beginning to resemble the season - defining moment many suspected it might be			0
@entity0 players celebrate as they move level on points with @entity2 at the top of the table city manager @entity9 congratulates goal - scorer @entity21 as he is substituted a routine 3 - 0 victory against @entity23 on saturday — achieved without a recognised striker — was ominous in its simplicity and @entity0 now sit level on points with @entity2 at the top of the table			1
@entity9 was pithy in his assessment , saying : ‘ i know three weeks ago we were many points behind , close to elimination in the @entity6 and we were a team that depends on @entity12			1
so maybe this is a miracle			0
but the miracle has a name — and that is work			0
’ the modern @entity0 do not disappear quietly			1
ask @entity39 , whose @entity41 team were nine points clear of @entity0 with four weeks left of the last campaign			2
‘ we ’re @entity0 , we fight till the end , ’ was the defiant chant at the @entity45			2
@entity21 opened the scoring with a deflected shot during @entity0 's win against @entity23 @entity21 ( right ) struck his second goal after the interval to send the champions right back into the title race @entity0 have been wearing their ambush paint again in recent weeks and this time it is @entity56 ’s @entity2 who must concentrate their formidable energies on keeping their noses in front			1
it will not be easy , with @entity0 on a run of eight victories , six in the @entity3			1
it is a streak that features four consecutive clean sheets — mostly without @entity66 , @entity12 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
on saturday , the goalscoring mantle was taken up by @entity21			2
with @entity71 as the frontman , the @entity70 was typically graceful , conducting the attack with @entity74			0
the two have struck up a fantastic understanding and , at times , looked to be operating on their own clock			0
@entity79 completed the rout with his side 's third goal from a thunderous strike late in the game @entity85 manager @entity9 insisted his side 's revival this season is the result of hard work @entity23 , it should be said , were limited in the extreme and it is now only one victory in 11 league games for @entity96 ’s side			1
they are trying to strengthen at the back and have offered £ 2.5million for @entity99 and @entity100 left back @entity101			0
it helps @entity0 to have @entity71 , that @entity104 army knife of a footballer who produces accomplished displays wherever he is asked to perform			2
‘ he is a complete player ’ was @entity21 ’s glowing verdict on @entity71 , who laid on the pass for @entity79 to seal the victory			1
@entity21 is sure @entity2 will be tested at @entity111 this evening and also in imminent visits to @entity113 and @entity114			2
a defeat for @entity56 ’s team tonight would see @entity0 overtake them and grab first place for @entity119			0
‘ it will be a tough game for @entity2 , ’ added @entity21			0
with fixtures against @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 on the horizon , there is optimism in @entity129 that the pendulum is swinging @entity0 ’s way .			0

@entity0 beat @entity23 3 - 0 in their @entity3 clash
@entity21 scored twice and @entity79 also scored for @entity0
@entity9 said hard work had brought them back into form
