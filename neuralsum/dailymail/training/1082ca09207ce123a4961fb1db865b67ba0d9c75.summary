the handshake seen ' round the water cooler was no fluke , it turns out			0
when president @entity5 approached the podium at @entity8 's memorial service and made a beeline for a row of foreign leaders – stopping first to shake @entity13 dictator @entity12 's hand – it came after representatives from the two historically antagonistic nations had already been in talks for six months			1
' [ b ] ehind the scenes , ' two @entity22 national security reporters wrote on tuesday , ' @entity20 and @entity13 officials have held midlevel discussions in @entity24 and @entity25 on a range of issues , including direct postal service , migration issues , disaster response , and search and rescue at sea			1
' during the president 's trip back from @entity36 , deputy national security adviser @entity33 told reporters on @entity38 that ' it 's been quite some time since the presidents of the @entity20 and @entity13 were even in the same place			1
' but he acknowledged that ' we ’re in talks on issues associated with migration that , again , i think allow for there to be greater connectivity particularly among @entity50 and @entity13			0
the @entity5 administration has already turned heads by lifting an earlier prohibition on family travel and money transfers to @entity13			0
but a hostage situation and the iron fist that @entity12 wields against @entity84 activists have largely kept the @entity20 at arms ' length			0
national security adviser @entity87 laid out a case for the softer approach on dec. 4 during a speech during a @entity25 human right summit			1
' ultimately , it will be the @entity13 people who drive economic and political reforms , ' said @entity95			0
' and that ’s why president @entity5 has increased the flow of resources and information to ordinary citizens			2
' the hostage situation involves @entity102 , who has sat in a @entity13 jail for four years			0
he drew a 15 - year sentence ' for facilitating uncensored internet contact ' between a small religious community on the island and the rest of the world , ' as @entity111 press secretary @entity110 put it on dec. 3			0
@entity102 penned a letter to @entity5 this month , asking for his direct participation in an effort to free him			0
some observers hinted on tuesday that the @entity5 – @entity12 handshake may have been an overture toward that end			2
the @entity5 administration , meanwhile , faces immediate obstacles to a @entity13 rapprochement that go far beyond the imprisonment of one @entity123			2
@entity12 was a guerrilla commander under his brother @entity124 in the 1950s and then helmed @entity13 's armed forces for nearly five decades before becoming president in 2008			2
after the revolution , he was responsible for overseeing the executions of soldiers who were loyal to the deposed , @entity20 - supported president @entity131 @entity13 - @entity123 lawmakers were brutal in their assessment of the @entity36 handshake , and threaten to make noise if the @entity111 takes public steps toward relaxing its half - century - long estrangement and trade embargo			1
' it is nauseating ' : rep. @entity140 slammed @entity5 for shaking hands with the @entity13 strongman ' when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like @entity12 , it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant , ' @entity144 rep. @entity140 said tuesday during a @entity153 hearing			1
@entity154 , another @entity144 @entity155 , said in a statement that ' the excitement exhibited in some liberal quarters regarding the embrace of @entity12 by president @entity5 ignores the millions of victims of the totalitarian @entity12 regime			1
' ' president @entity5 failed the people of @entity13 with this very public handshake , ' added @entity166 @entity165 rep. @entity165			1
some criticism came from @entity168 , including @entity170 rep. @entity169			0
' i 'm very disappointed that the president would shake the hand of someone who stands for the opposite of everything @entity8 stood for , " the @entity13 - @entity123 congressman told @entity178			2
' @entity12 stands for the abuse of human rights and lack of freedom			0
it was just very hypocritical of the president to go and honor @entity8 and then turn around and shake hands with @entity12			0
' in july the nation of @entity187 intercepted a ship traveling from @entity13 to @entity189 with a cargo of what the vessel 's manifest said was sugar			0
it turned out to be a massive cache of missiles and missile parts intended for one of @entity123 's more fearful enemies , in violation of both @entity20 and @entity203 sanctions			1
' it was just very hypocritical of the president to go and honor @entity8 and then turn around and shake hands with @entity12 , ' alleged rep. @entity169 and while @entity5 and @entity12 shook hands in @entity36 on @entity210 , at least 20 human rights protesters were detained in @entity24 when they gathered for a public demonstration			2
but when it 's practical , the @entity5 administration has seemed to embrace @entity13 's involvement in achieving @entity123 's other geopolitical objectives			1
the whole world is watching : @entity5 and @entity12 found themselves under an unprecedented spotlight as the world 's attention turned to @entity8 's memorial service when @entity12 agreed to host peace talks between the @entity224 government and a @entity226 guerilla group called the @entity227 ( @entity227 ) , @entity5 had good things to say about @entity13 's decision to put @entity227 , which is has supported , in the same room with a government whose drug - interdiction policies are crucial to @entity20 efforts along the same lines			1
episodes like that , some former government insiders say , have put @entity123 on a collision course with a @entity13 that 's suddenly interested in normalizing relations – an outcome that nearly every nation supported during a recent @entity243			2
. ' the @entity13 regularly say to people that they are ready for a different relationship , ' @entity5 administration veteran @entity244 told @entity22			0
during @entity5 's first term in the @entity111 , @entity244 managed @entity123 policy at the @entity249			2
he said in addition to one - on - one midlevel talks , intermediaries have delivered @entity12 ’s messages to the @entity5 administration – usually @entity20 citizens with connections to the @entity13 government			1
@entity123 diplomats political leaders , he added , have also been involved with back - channel - communications between @entity25 and @entity24			1
@entity262 fellow @entity261 added that ' there has been a string of emissaries , both private citizens and @entity123 leaders , who have begun to nudge @entity5 forward on engaging in talks with @entity13 and also carrying a message from @entity12 that he ’s willing to talk			1
' @entity261 has what the @entity22 called ' exceptionally close ties to the @entity5 @entity111			0
' he also traveled with vice president @entity272 when he visited @entity273 recently .			0

@entity20 and @entity13 officials have held *mid-level* discussions in @entity25 and @entity24
' we 're in talks ' with @entity13 on a wide range of issues , agreed deputy national security adviser @entity33 on tuesday
middle - men including @entity123 diplomats have also been carrying messages back and forth between @entity25 and @entity24
@entity20 - @entity13 relations have seen an unprecedented thaw since president @entity5 took office , and a host of lawmakers with @entity13 ties are upset
@entity123 's 50 - year - long trade embargo with the communist nation has been slammed by the @entity203 but embraced by *survivors* of the @entity12 regime
