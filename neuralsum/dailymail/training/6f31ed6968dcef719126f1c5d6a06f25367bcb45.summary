the @entity3 was snapped in the driving seat of the green @entity8 on a visit to @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 yesterday			1
the car firm has teamed up with the @entity3 's @entity14 to offer five @entity8 2 vehicles for a year to individuals and groups who can prove they can put it to good use for the benefit of their community			1
launching the scheme , the @entity3 showed off his driving skills as he drove one of the vehicles on a mini-terrapod that uses a combination of steep slopes , low friction surfaces and other obstacles to emphasise the grip and traction abilities of the vehicle			1
dressed in a tweed coat and olive green scarf and gloves , he smiled as he climbed behind the wheel - without a chauffeur in sight			2
just minutes later he 'd completed the tricky maneuver with aplomb			2
the @entity3 said said : ' i want to use this opportunity to express my warmest possible gratitude to @entity8 for their really remarkable generosity in ensuring we now have this splendid scheme			1
' this is a wonderful act of generosity			2
it is the sort of willingness to become involved on the part of different companies which can make such a fantastic difference , above all in ensuring we can maintain the priceless national asset which is our precious countryside			0
in particular , the upland areas which tends to be the ones that visitors want to go to - millions of them every year			0
on the way down : the @entity3 maneuvers down the slope at @entity10 , near @entity11 , @entity12 safely back : the prince climbs out of the vehicle in his tweed coat and olive green gloves ' the important thing to remember is if we do not look after it , of course it is the farmers who do much of that , then once that is lost you just can not recreate it			1
it is not something you can start again so easily			0
' so far as i am concerned , the @entity14 will do its utmost to help the future of all of these smaller family farms and the rural community			2
' the fund 's director @entity98 said : ' we are excited about the variety of people and businesses that we are expecting to apply			0
4x4 vehicles are crucial in helping rural businesses get around the countryside for their daily business needs			2
' meeting : the @entity3 greets locals during the demonstration day at @entity10 , @entity111 , @entity12 @entity112 , marketing director of @entity8 @entity113 , said : ' having reliable and dependable transport to work in the countryside is essential and we hope these bursaries will benefit entrepreneurial farmers			1
' @entity3 set up the fund three years ago to support @entity113 's hard - pressed rural areas			1
so far it has given more than £ 2.1 million in grants distributed to 60 projects and directly benefiting nearly 40,000 people			0
earlier this week , the fund authorised £ 219,000 from its emergency relief fund to help farmers during the @entity129 period following the recent cold snap and late arrival of spring			0
he said : ' i know at the moment that the farming community must be suffering the most awful difficulties and challenges , what with the weather and last year 's awful difficulties again with the weather			0
flying visit : the @entity3 arrives by helicopter with his entourage for the cold and windy visit ' on top of that comes diseases of all kind and also rising prices , the beef costs , and also the difficulties so many farmers have been experiencing in not being able to drill their autumn crops and now with more difficulty in trying to drill the spring crops			1
' and of course the snow now , the cold , lambing , people losing their lambs and sheeps ... all of these things combining			0
' what we find is that the farming charities are experiencing more and more calls to their offices , in despair many of them at the situation they are facing			0
so that stress levels are rising all the time			0
' crowds : prince @entity3 visits @entity11 market , shaking hands with traders tasting : the @entity3 enjoyed a tipple of jubilee stout courtesy of the @entity181 @entity3 later enjoyed an hour - long tour of the historic market town of @entity11 which he last visited in 1993			1
