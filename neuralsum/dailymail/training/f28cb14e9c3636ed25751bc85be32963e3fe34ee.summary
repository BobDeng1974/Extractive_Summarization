by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent stringent : the rules have been introduced after @entity3 , pictured , abused children for decades celebrities and other public figures who use their fame to abuse children will face longer sentences under new rules published today			1
tougher sentences for future cases similar to those of @entity3 and @entity14 are a response to the public outcry over a string historic sex abuse cases dating back decades			1
the move is part of wider toughening of sex offence sentencing guidelines designed to protect the public against dangerous rapists , paedophiles and online perverts			1
among the changes are : @entity29 chairman @entity28 said : ' no - one wants more people falling victim to offenders who come before the courts , and public protection is central to this guideline , whether this is by jailing offenders or , where appropriate , imposing a rigorous treatment order and other restrictions to prevent reoffending			0
' the new guidelines for judges cover more than 50 sex offences including rape , child sex offences and trafficking			1
significantly , it will mean future cases similar to that of @entity14 - the disgraced it ’s a knockout presenter - or @entity52 , would be likely to result in longer jail sentences			2
sex attackers will no longer get a shorter sentence because of their claimed ‘ good character ’ if they used their public image and status to target victims			1
paedophile : the guidelines were released in the wake of celebrity abusers including @entity3 jailed : former it 's a @entity51 presenter @entity14 , pictured , was also convicted of exploiting children other factors likely to lead to a longer sentence are the involvement of multiple people - a response to the sickening grooming gang cases in @entity72 and @entity73			1
the guidelines also explicitly recognise for the first time the psychological damage caused by rape and other sex crimes , and the long term impact on victims			1
on child pornography offences , anyone caught downloading even the lowest level of images will not ‘ get off ’ with a fine , although judges are also encouraged to use community sentences involving treatment than short jail terms			1
sick : the @entity29 also reviewed cases of gangs of men grooming girls			2
@entity94 , pictured , led one such gang in @entity72 anyone distributing sick videos or making their own while abusing youngsters will also receive longer sentences			2
over the last five years a total of 59 paedophiles were fined for possession of child abuse images			2
earlier this year there was an outcry when a 13 - year - old sex attack victim was described in court as ‘ predatory ’ - and her attacker got a suspended jail sentence			0
the new guidelines make clear that children aged 13 or over no longer able to ‘ consent ’ to sex			0
longer terms will be doled out to gangs found guilty of grooming their victims			1
in @entity72 and @entity73 young girls were abused by groups of men whom they regarded as their ‘ boyfriends ’ and whose plight was ignored by police and social services who regarded them as consenting			1
the new rules also acknowledge the increasing use of technology by paedophiles online			0
criminals who use codes to hide sex offending activity , who groom online and luring children into sharing explicit photos or videos can expect tougher penalties			0
children ’s charities welcomed the changes , which come in to effect from april			0
@entity147 ’s deputy director of strategy @entity148 said : ‘ the publication of this new sentencing guideline will help to ensure the focus is on the perpetrator and not the victim			0
‘ as the guideline emphasises , it is plain wrong to imply in any way that the experiences of sexually - exploited children are something they bring on themselves			0
’ @entity162 , deputy @entity163 said : ‘ these far - reaching changes to the guidelines on sentencing for sexual offences by adults by the @entity170 rightly place the victims centre stage			2
‘ the new guidelines give an unequivocal message that society considers sex offences to be amongst the most serious and grave crimes that can be committed			0
‘ the impact , including long term consequences , for victims are frequently devastating			0
these guidelines make clear that such crimes are abhorrent and that sentences will properly reflect the gravity of the offence			0

@entity188 guidelines for judges cover more than 50 offences
celebrities who abuse their good name and ' grooming gangs ' both targeted
paedophiles who download child porn will no longer be let off with a fine
guidelines recognise psychological damage in sentencing for the first time
an end of the *scandal* of paedophiles caught downloading child pornography being let off with only a fine
longer basic sentences for the most *extreme* rape attacks of at least *15* years
longer terms for groups of predatory men who groom young victims following the @entity72 and @entity73 sex ring cases
