denied : @entity0 said she was warned by @entity2 officials that she risked arrest before she took on the case of three @entity6 journalists @entity0 has denied claims that she was threatened with arrest by @entity2 officials over her work representing three @entity6 journalists			1
according to a @entity11 report last week , the human rights lawyer was warned after presenting a report identifying cracks in the judiciary that led to the conviction of three @entity6 journalists last year			1
on sunday , mrs @entity0 clarified that the warning came in early 2014 - months before she took on the case - when officials said publishing a report could lead to her arrest			2
the @entity21 moved the report 's launch from @entity24 to @entity25 as a result			1
writing in an op - ed for the @entity27 - which calls for the release of detained reporter @entity29 - mrs @entity0 wrote : ' the journalist has since apologized for the misleading presentation of this matter in the article and corrections were made to the text to attempt to address this			0
' her words come after @entity2 's interior ministry spokesman @entity39 denied the allegations from mrs @entity0 , demanding she reveal who threatened her			1
' she should say exactly who said that , ' @entity39 said			0
' why not specify from the start who told her that ? ' ' we have nothing against her , ' he said			0
mrs @entity0 's report , which was written before she became involved in the @entity6 case , was considered highly controversial for its criticisms of @entity2 's courts			1
speaking to @entity11 after the @entity6 journalists ' appeal hearing this week , she said : ' when i went to launch the report , first of all they stopped us from doing it in @entity24			1
' they said " does the report criticise the army , the judiciary , or the government ? " we said " well , yes "			2
they said " well then , you 're risking arrest "			0
' the report , compiled on behalf of the @entity21 , suggested @entity2 's judicial system was insufficiently independent			1
it highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors			2
mrs @entity0 , who recently married @entity78 star @entity77 , and her team recommended the practice that allows @entity2 officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop			1
she added : ' that recommendation was n't followed , and we 've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts			0
' the three @entity6 journalists represented by mrs @entity0 are @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96			0
the group was initially sentenced to between seven and ten years in prison last june by the controversial @entity2 judge @entity99			0
a few months later he gained further infamy after sentencing 188 people to death in one mass trial			0
the three journalists launched a new appeal yesterday - but mrs @entity0 suggested she fears the flaws highlighted in her report will prevent the group from receiving a fair trial			0
the men have been held since december 2013 - with their arrests coming after the overthrow of @entity127 president @entity126 , a @entity128 member			0
one of the defendants , @entity95 , hold an @entity2 passport - and must pin his hopes on his sentence being overturned by the @entity2 courts			2
but @entity0 's other clients , mr @entity96 , a @entity136 citizen , and his @entity138 colleague mr @entity94 , are still hoping for deportation to their home countries			0
both have applied to @entity2 's chief prosecutor to demand they be sent to @entity136 and @entity138 under the terms of a new presidential decree that gives foreign prisoners such an option			2
inside @entity2 , mr @entity96 's appeals team was led by an @entity2 lawyer with contributions from @entity0 that related to international law - but outside the country she is the one leading the efforts to win deportation			1
wedding of the year : @entity0 married @entity77 in @entity154 in september last year - seven months after her legal team produced a report exposing flaws in @entity2 's judiciary system			1

human rights lawyer produced report before taking on @entity6 clients
@entity2 officials warned she could be arrested for criticizing government
she was prevented from presenting the report in @entity24 on this basis
her team 's findings suggested courts were not sufficiently independent
