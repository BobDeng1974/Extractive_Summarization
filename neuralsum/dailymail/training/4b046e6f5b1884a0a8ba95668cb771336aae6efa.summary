it contains one of the biggest and brightest stars in our galaxy , weighing at least 90 times the mass of the sun. the @entity9 star system , however , also has a dark side - it could bring the end of life on @entity13			1
however , the good news is that experts say this is ' extremely ' unlikely - but can not rule it out			2
@entity9 , also dubbed the ' death star ' , is a stellar system 7,500 light years from @entity13 , and it is on the brink of a supernova detonation			1
' simply put , @entity9 is a supermassive stellar powder keg nearing the end of its fuse , ' said @entity26			2
' it could , in fact , already have met its doom , and the light bearing news of its cataclysmic death could be streaming toward us even now			0
@entity9 , also dubbed the ' death star ' , is a stellar system 7,500 light years from @entity13 , and it is on the brink of a supernova detonation			1
' as one of the first objects observed by @entity42 's @entity41 after its launch some 15 years ago , this double star system continues to reveal new clues about its nature through the x-rays it generates , ' said @entity42			0
astronomers are trying to learn more about the two stars in the @entity9 system and how they interact with each other			1
the heavier of the two stars is quickly losing mass through wind streaming away from its surface at over a million miles per hour			2
while not the giant purge of the @entity59 , this star is still losing mass at a very high rate that will add up to the sun 's mass in about a millennium			2
though smaller than its partner , the companion star in @entity9 is also massive , weighing in at about 30 times the mass of the sun. it is losing matter at a rate that is about a hundred times lower than its partner , but still a prodigious weight loss compared to most other stars			1
the companion star beats the bigger star in wind speed , with its wind clocking in almost ten times faster			0
astronomers reported extremely volatile behaviour from @entity9 in the 19th century , when it became very bright for two decades , outshining nearly every star in the entire sky			0
this event became known as the ' @entity59			0
' data from modern telescopes reveal that @entity9 threw off about ten times the sun 's mass during that time			1
the @entity41 internet site 14 october , 1999 shows the complex nature of the region around @entity9			0
some experts believe that @entity9 ’s supernova could unleash a gamma - ray burst ( @entity95 ) , one of the brightest explosions in the universe			1
this could , in turn , destroy our ozone layer , frying everyone and everything that does n’t have access to some very , very strong sun block			0
however astrophysicist dr @entity107 told @entity26 that this is nearly impossible as ‘ we simply are n’t close enough to it and it ’s not pointing in our direction in any case ’ .			0

@entity9 contains one of the biggest and brightest stars in our galaxy
weighs at least 90 times the mass of the sun
some believe it could some experts believe that @entity9 ’s supernova could unleash a gamma - ray burst ( @entity95 )
