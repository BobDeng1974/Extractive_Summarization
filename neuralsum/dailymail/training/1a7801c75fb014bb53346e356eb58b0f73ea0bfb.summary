by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 16 april 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 16 april 2013 @entity1 is believed to be about to start manufacturing the @entity2 , the latest version of its hugely successful handset			1
@entity5 , the @entity6 manufacturer that has made previous versions , is believed to have been hiring 10,000 workers a week since march for the production lines that will produce it			2
the handset is expected to go on sale in the autumn , and @entity1 is also believed to be developing a cheaper version			1
customers queue up to purchase the @entity17 smartphone at the @entity1 flagship store on @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21			1
the firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer			0
@entity1 's next two @entity25 had already been designed before @entity26 died in october 2011 , it has been claimed			1
at a meeting with the @entity30 district attorney , @entity29 , who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region , @entity1 's liaison officer @entity27 is reported by the @entity33 to have said the designs for the next two phones ' preceded @entity36 [ being chief executive ] '			1
' we have been very busy recently as we will start mass - producing the new iphone soon , ' a @entity39 - based @entity5 executive told the @entity42			0
the company has more than 1.4 million workers in @entity6 , according to the report			0
it typically adjusts staffing according to the electronics production cycle , for which demand usually picks up in the second quarter after a traditionally slow start to the year			0
the new model is believed to look identical to the current @entity17 but include a faster processor and updated camera , according to online reports			0
it will also run @entity56 7 , a major new version of @entity1 's @entity58 and @entity17 software being overseen by @entity1 's sir @entity59			2
earlier this month it was reported @entity1 had hit major delays with its flagship @entity63 software due to a radical new look and feel			2
experts say engineers have had to be pulled from its @entity69 software group so the new version can be finished in time for a rumoured summer launch			0
sir @entity59 was given responsibility for the software earlier this year after the company fired @entity76 in a move believed to be related to the firm 's huge problems with its @entity81 app. ' what i 've heard : @entity56 is running behind , and engineers have been pulled from @entity85 to work on it ' said @entity87 of the @entity1 blog @entity89			1
he also claimed engineers working on the project had been given special handsets			0
' @entity93 is that @entity56 engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their @entity17 displays , such that it greatly decreases viewing angles , thus making it difficult for observers to see the apparently rather significant system - wide @entity104 overhaul			0
' leaked photo ? this image purports to show the case of the new @entity2			2
published by @entity113 website @entity111 , the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update to the latest @entity1 phone the claims echo those made by @entity118 of investment bank @entity119 earlier this year , who said @entity1 will begin making a new @entity17 model in march for an expected launch in june or july			1
mr @entity118 predicted that @entity17 sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model , but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to march			0
' as word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread , we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand @entity132 in anticipation of the new product launch and @entity1 will likely start curtailing channel inventory , ' he was quoted as saying by @entity137			2
' therefore we tweak down our @entity139 shipment estimate from @entity140 to @entity141 , which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid- @entity144			0
' the analyst 's prediction of a summer launch date for the @entity2 is a reiteration of claims he made last month , when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life			1
on rumours of an entry - level @entity17 , mr @entity118 claimed @entity1 could release a low - cost device made of polycarbonate with no @entity158 ( @entity160 ) capability			1
the speculation seemed to contradict comments made by @entity163 , @entity1 's marketing chief , who recently told @entity6 newspaper the @entity165 that ' despite the popularity of cheap smartphones , this well never be the future of @entity1 's products			1

@entity2 is expected to go on sale later this year
@entity1 also rumoured to be developing a lower cost iphone made from *plastic*
