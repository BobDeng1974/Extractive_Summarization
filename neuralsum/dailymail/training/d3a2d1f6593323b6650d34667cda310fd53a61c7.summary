when @entity3 was dropped after two matches of @entity6 ’s tour to @entity7 before @entity8 , his @entity1 place was very much in jeopardy			1
now he has confirmed his role at the top of the order in emphatic fashion			0
not only did @entity3 ’s magnificent 187 at the @entity14 on wednesday spoil @entity17 prime minister @entity16 ’s annual cricketing party but it proved that perhaps @entity6 can play modern one - day cricket after all			1
the giddy heights of 391 for six against a far - from - shabby prime minister ’s @entity20 was certainly a statement from an @entity6 side who seemed to arrive in @entity25 hoping once again that everything would be all right on the @entity1 night			1
@entity3 hits out on his way to a magnificent 187 as @entity6 beat a @entity20 in @entity28 @entity3 's innings dispelled any thoughts that he does not deserve a place in @entity6 's @entity1 line - up nothing more so than the contribution of @entity3 , who was controversially handed @entity36 ’s opening role here ahead of @entity38 on the far - from - convincing evidence of just three centuries in 150 odis			1
@entity3 is @entity6 ’s classiest @entity42 batsman but he has never been as comfortable in coloured clothing and his selection seemed to provide more ammunition to those who feel @entity6 remain stuck in the one - day dark ages			2
this , then , was vindication for the selectors , who ditched their captain cook before coming here but not their game - plan , and provided a little hope that this @entity1 mission might not necessarily be doomed to failure			0
the opener 's enormous score helped @entity6 reach a total of 391 for six at the @entity14 @entity3 is congratulated by @entity60 after reaching his century against the prime minister 's @entity20 ‘ of course i was worried about my @entity1 place , ’ admitted @entity3 afterwards			1
‘ the squad had to be narrowed down and a lot of people have come in and done well			0
coming out here i did n’t know where i was going to bat or even if i was going to start , so it was nice to have a good chat with @entity71 when he told me i was going to get first crack			0
’ the sight of @entity74 , far from certain of a place in @entity25 ’s @entity1 side , smashing 136 off 89 balls in reply ensured @entity6 did not get too carried away by their sudden show of batting strength			1
another notable mention must go to @entity82 who managed to complete a stunning ' keepy - up ' catch to dismiss @entity84			0
@entity82 fumbles a catch in the field during the prime minister 's xi clash in @entity28 on wednesday the 25 - year - old keeps his eye on the ball as it rebounds off his thigh after a wayward shot from @entity84 @entity94 manages to flick the ball with his feet back towards his grasp all in one motion the 25 - year - old fumbled @entity84 's attempt for a boundary as the ball rebounded off his thigh and looked destined to be a missed chance in the field			0
however @entity82 was able to flick the ball with his feet back towards his hands in one swift motion to complete an impressive recovery to add an extra gloss to the victory			0
more will become clear once @entity6 have faced @entity25 and @entity110 in the tri-series , which begins tomorrow , but for now they can be satisfied with just about the perfect batting display even if their bowling here was not so effective			0
@entity6 want @entity3 to bat through an innings while others , notably his partner @entity119 , attack around him and the plan was executed spectacularly by the openers and a worthy accomplice in @entity60			1
@entity94 completes his remarkable recovery and catch to help dismiss @entity84 off @entity125 's bowling @entity119 said ahead of this final warm - up game that he would carry on being aggressive and he was as good as his word as he smacked 71 off 49 balls , including six fours in one frenetic nine - ball spell			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , moved to his hundred at just about a run a ball before accelerating to @entity6 ’s highest individual score in a one - day match , hitting three sixes and 20 fours while consigning @entity38 very much to the subs ’ bench			1
‘ one thing i ’ve probably been guilty of when i ’ve opened in the past is getting to 60 or 70 and not going on , ’ said @entity3			0
‘ but i enjoyed myself and if i can do that a couple more times it will be good for the team			0
it ’s nice to have a good start but the big stuff starts on friday			0
’ @entity149 ( centre ) celebrates with his @entity6 team - mates after dismissing @entity152 ( 14 ) @entity74 led the fightback for the prime minister 's xi , hitting 136 off 89 balls @entity156 is bowled by @entity157 ( not pictured ) for 19 runs as wicketkeeper @entity159 looks on only when he had reached 68 did @entity3 offer a semblance of a chance — @entity74 doing well to get a hand to a low drive — before guiding @entity6 to their equal highest score in a 50 - over game , matching the 391 they smashed against @entity166 at @entity167 in the heady summer of 2005			1
@entity60 is another batsman who looked a long way from a @entity1 place not so long ago but he came into the @entity6 side in @entity7 when @entity36 was suspended and has made the most of his unexpected opportunity			2
the biggest compliment that can be paid to @entity3 and @entity60 is that they moved through the gears without fuss and as effortlessly as any of the leading exponents of the modern @entity180 - driven 50 - over game			2
they added 141 in 24 overs , @entity60 hitting 71 off 77 balls , as @entity6 impressively followed up the 364 they had scored in their opening tour match here in the @entity17 capital against rather more modest opposition			2
@entity6 's @entity60 hits out during his innings of 71 off 79 balls @entity119 offered strong support for @entity3 with an attacking 71 runs off 49 balls when @entity6 stood at 200 for one after 30 overs , a score of 400 did look on the cards and their failure to fully do themselves justice looked as if it might cost them dear when @entity74 set off in hot pursuit			1
the man known as the ‘ @entity201 ’ in these parts is certainly a destructive performer and here he came close to taking apart a one - dimensional @entity6 attack lacking @entity204 , who is being eased back into competitive action			0
if @entity74 , one of two @entity17 @entity1 players along with @entity207 in the pm ’s side , had stayed for another five overs , @entity6 would have been in trouble			2
but once @entity149 had him caught at point , the home side had too big a mountain to climb			0
they finished 60 short on a day of 722 runs , @entity159 having earlier taking a spectacular running catch to dismiss captain @entity217 , and now @entity6 will travel to @entity218 to take on @entity25 with just a little hope in their heart			2
@entity17 prime minister @entity16 joins captains @entity71 and @entity217 for the toss @entity119 celebrates with @entity159 after taking the wicket of @entity224 for 16 runs @entity74 celebrates reaching his century - his innings of 136 was n't quite enough for the @entity20			1

@entity6 beat @entity20 by 60 runs in @entity1 warm - up
@entity3 hit magnificent 187 at @entity14 in @entity28
@entity119 and @entity60 both hit 71 as @entity6 posted score of 391 - 6
@entity74 scored 136 in response but hosts could only reach *331*
@entity149 was pick of the bowlers with four wickets
