@entity10 district judge @entity9 gave the tax agency a month to submit the explanation in writing			1

he said the @entity1 declaration must be signed , under oath , by the appropriate @entity1 official			0
the @entity1 says it lost the emails in 2011 when @entity27 's computer crashed			1
at the time , @entity27 headed the @entity1 division that processes applications for tax - exempt status			1
@entity27 , who refused to answer questions at two @entity42 committee hearings , has become a central figure in several congressional investigations over the handling of tea party applications			2
at both hearings , @entity27 cited her fifth amendment right not to incriminate herself			0
@entity1 commissioner @entity49 has testified on the lost emails before @entity51 at least three times			0
each time he was under oath			0
@entity49 said he first learned there was a problem with @entity27 's computer in february but did n't learn that emails were lost until april			2
the @entity1 notified @entity51 june 13			0
@entity21 lawyer @entity58 complained that the @entity1 never informed her group or the court about the lost emails , even though @entity9 had ordered the @entity1 to produce documents related to the information request on a monthly basis			1
@entity10 district judge @entity9 ordered the @entity1 to declare under oath what happened to @entity27 's emails @entity67 , a @entity68 lawyer representing the @entity1 , said the agency had no legal obligation to tell @entity21 about emails that may have been destroyed two years before the group filed its request for information			1
@entity21 filed a series of requests with the @entity1 shortly after the @entity7 controversy erupted in may 2013			0
among its requests , the watchdog group wanted communications @entity27 had with others concerning the handling of applications for tax - exempt status since jan. 1 , 2010			1
@entity21 filed a lawsuit against the @entity1 in october , saying the agency did n't produce any documents			2
since then , the @entity1 started to produce some documents in february , @entity58 said			0
on thursday , @entity58 asked @entity9 to conduct a limited discovery to determine what happened to the emails , perhaps compelling testimony from @entity1 officials			2
but @entity9 said that would be premature			0
@entity67 noted that the tax agency 's inspector general is conducting an investigation into the lost emails			2
@entity67 said the inspector general has asked the @entity1 not to question witnesses that may have information about the lost emails to avoid interfering with its investigation			0
@entity9 said the sworn @entity1 statement should include information about the inspector general 's concerns			0
@entity9 said he would assign federal magistrate @entity106 to look into ways of obtaining the @entity1 records from other sources , though it is unclear how much information could be recovered			0
@entity1 commissioner @entity49 has already testified under oath that @entity27 's emails were unrecoverable , and drew gasps in a @entity42 hearing room when he said the agency had already destroyed and recycled her hard drive in 2011 , the @entity1 had a policy of backing up emails on computer tapes , but the tapes were recycled every six months , @entity49 told @entity51			1
he said @entity27 's hard drive was recycled and presumably destroyed , after technicians in the agency 's criminal investigations unit tried unsuccessfully to restore it			1
the @entity1 was able to generate 24,000 @entity27 emails from the 2009 to 2011 period because she had copied in other @entity1 employees , @entity49 said			0
as part of the congressional investigations , the @entity1 said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from @entity27 , covering the period from 2009 to 2013			2
