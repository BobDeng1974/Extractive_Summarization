a breakthrough in genetic science could pave the way for the developments of drugs for asthma and other allergies			1
scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies , which could become targets for new drugs			1
asthma affects one in ten children in the @entity14 , and allergies are thought to afflict a third of the population			1
scientists have discovered 34 genes that predispose people to allergies , which could become targets for new drugs			1
it could pave the way for new treatments for asthma , which affects one in ten @entity14 children ( file picture ) this new study , led by scientists at @entity27 over the last decade , used new ways to study the genes in the immune system			1
scientists pinpointed genes which regulate an antibody involved in triggering allergic responses			0
although the antibody , called immunoglobin e , was already well known , the genes that control it had never been identified			0
the discovery creates the process of switching off these genes using drugs			0
professor @entity41 , from the @entity42 at @entity27 , said : ‘ our pioneering approach allowed us to obtain insights that we were n’t able to get from traditional genetics			0
‘ it is n’t just the genetic code that can influence disease and dna sequencing can only take you so far			0
‘ our study shows that modifications on top of the dna that control how genes are read may be even more important			0
” the research , published in the journal nature , focused on genes that are altered by an environmentally - triggered process called methylation , which switches them off			0
the study , led by scientists at @entity27 ( pictured ) , used new ways to study the genes in the immune system and scientists pinpointed those which regulate an antibody involved in triggering allergies white blood cells from @entity71 families affected by asthma were analysed to compare levels of methylation with the amount of the antibody in the blood			1
the scientists found strong associations between the antibody and low methylation rates in 34 genes			2
tests confirmed that all 34 genes were most active in asthmatics with high levels of the antibody			2
if the genes can be switched on using drugs , the antibody levels could be reduced and allergies effectively treated			2
dr @entity92 , director of research at @entity14 , said : ‘ we welcome this research which explores the genetic relationship between allergies and asthma which could bring us one step closer to developing ground - breaking asthma treatments and finding a cure			2
