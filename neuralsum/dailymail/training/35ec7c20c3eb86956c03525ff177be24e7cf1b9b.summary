it 's the vital ingredient which ensures @entity2 dinner will go with ... well , a bang			0
this year we will pull apart 300 million crackers – that ’s five for every person in the country – at a total cost of £ 60 million			1
that ’s an awful lot of feeble puns , cheap toys and flimsy paper hats that disintegrate as soon as you try to get them around your head			1
@entity17 ( right ) had his daughter @entity18 ( left ) put a range of @entity2 crackers to the test			2
she found that @entity23 's budget set of eight for a quid topped @entity26 ' set of six which cost over 130 times as much @entity23 's crackers might come with flimsy hats but they let out a great ' crack ' and wo n't hurt your pocket but high - end versions are also available			1
one luxury - goods website has launched a set of six for £ 4 million with gifts including @entity38 necklaces , an @entity40 coupé and a @entity42 yacht ... but no jokes			1
even the @entity45 ’s meal is said to feature crackers , with the queen believed to be especially fond of finding musical toys			0
co-op 's crackers promise more than they deliver , while @entity51 's have an excellent bang and funky hats at the other end of the scale , @entity23 is offering eight crackers for a quid			1
here we ’ve put those budget versions , as well as supermarket favourites and designs from top - end stores , to the ultimate test – trying to impress my eight - year - old daughter , @entity18			1
the most expensive we tested came from @entity26 , which is selling a set of six for £ 99.50			2
@entity68 ' family version are better than their luxury range , while you ca n't quibble with @entity71 's 33p a pull to make comparisons easier , we ’ve calculated the cost per cracker , as they are variously sold in packs of six , eight or 12			2
extraordinarily , @entity23 comes out ahead of the luxury store – whose crackers cost more than 130 times as much			1
that , at least is @entity18 ’s verdict in our entirely subjective test			0
@entity18 and i pulled the crackers apart to gauge the quality of the jokes , toys and hat within – and to ensure that the cracker gives that all - important satisfying bang			2
@entity93 's crackers are questionable value at nearly £ 15 a pull			0
@entity95 's are cheaper , and special crackers were invented in 1847 by @entity98 confectioner @entity97 to shift his bon - bons – sugared almonds wrapped in tissue paper			0
he was said to have been inspired to add the ‘ crack ’ after hearing the crackle of a log on a fire			0
other traditional elements – the gifts and paper hats – have been around since the days of @entity97 ’s son , @entity109 , who introduced them to differentiate his product from a burgeoning number of rivals			0
@entity116 offer ' cracking hats ' , but @entity119 ' fare are not great value and look like ' cheap @entity122 shortbread '			0

this year we *'ll* pull apart 300 million of them at a total cost of £ 60 million
cheap crackers come with feeble puns , cheap toys and flimsy paper hats
at top end , set of six costs £ 4 million and comes with @entity38 necklaces
but @entity23 offers eight for a quid , and @entity26 sells six for £ 99.50
from *low* - end to *mid-range* and deluxe , my daughter put them to the test
@entity18 found @entity23 's came out on top over the luxury store 's offering
