it 's almost 29 years to the week since i made my @entity3 debut as a 19 - year - old			1
that feels like a lifetime ago , but some things in football never change : everybody wants to see young players come through			2
the good news is that this season more managers are willing to give the kids a chance			1
so far 21 players aged 21 or under have made their @entity16 debuts this campaign			2
more than half of those are defenders and that ’s unusual for a position that requires great maturity			0
but it does prove one thing : if you ’re good enough , you ’re old enough			2
this year @entity35 ’s @entity28 and @entity29 , @entity30 at @entity31 and @entity33 ’s @entity32 , whose average age is just under 20 , have each made a significant impact on his team			1
that is good to see			2
defender @entity28 ( right ) has made quite an impact at @entity35 this season too many people think the step up from youth team to first team is a massive one			1
yes there is a jump in quality , but if you ’re an ambitious youngster , it should just be another game			0
the problem for young players is that it often takes a special set of circumstances to play			0
are they ready ? is the incumbent injured or out of form ? what if they do n’t fit the manager ’s style ? managers are under so much pressure that they might not want to play a young lad in a key role			0
that ’s why you tend to see more young attackers than defenders playing			0
defenders normally get better with age			0
@entity29 ( right ) has repaid the faith of @entity35 manager @entity72 it ’s human nature to look at what people ca n’t do but if you make yourself part of a winning team , those doubts quickly disappear			1
possession is nine tenths of the law in football — if you ’ve got the shirt and the side is winning , then the manager has a difficult decision to make			0
at @entity3 , @entity89 had to persuade @entity90 to play me but after the first game at @entity93 my next two were against @entity94 and @entity35			1
@entity96 was already playing and our youth team included @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			2
@entity33 ’s @entity32 ( right ) has shown if you 're good enough , you 're old enough at the top level a group like that is rare , but when we saw @entity96 doing it — and he went on to become the club ’s youngest captain at 21 — we knew we could make it too : success breeds success			1
some managers do n’t trust young players in positions of responsibility — they would sooner play a young goalkeeper than a young centre half			0
but @entity35 manager @entity72 has always been happy to field young players and his use of @entity28 and @entity29 this season is first - class management			1
people assume playing centre back at @entity124 is too much pressure for a kid			0
these two have shown otherwise			2
@entity31 defender @entity30 was signed from @entity127 for £ 4m in the summer i do n’t think either would have had a chance of playing last season but now they are important members of @entity35 ’s squad			1
@entity28 is strong , fast and a quick learner , an important skill for any defender			1
my sources tell me that @entity29 was only on the fringes of @entity35 ’s @entity138 until @entity139 trusted him to play			1
that faith has been repaid			0
full back is slightly different as there is less defensive responsibility			0
even so , @entity30 and @entity32 have impressed and @entity143 has stood out for @entity3 — it ’s easy to forget he ’s still only 19			1
@entity31 striker @entity145 , aged 21 , has forced his way into the team further forward @entity148 , 23 , and @entity145 , 21 , have forced themselves into the team at @entity31			1
i like both but it ’s interesting to hear @entity148 say he is n’t a kid any more — his time is now			1
players obviously develop at different stages but age should not be a reason to hold anyone back			0
we all want to see more youngsters at the top level , especially kids who have come through the @entity166 season , at least , we are seeing more of them given a chance			2
@entity168 it worries me when i see goalkeepers being surprised by conditions on the pitch			0
they are always the first ones out for the warm up so if they do n’t get used to a dodgy surface in the hour before kick off something is wrong			0
if somebody shoots from outside the box , unless it ’s a wonderstrike i expect the keeper to deal with it .			0

@entity35 's @entity28 and @entity29 have had a significant impact this season
@entity33 defender @entity32 has shown if you 're good enough , you 're old enough
@entity148 and @entity145 have forced themselves into the @entity31 team
