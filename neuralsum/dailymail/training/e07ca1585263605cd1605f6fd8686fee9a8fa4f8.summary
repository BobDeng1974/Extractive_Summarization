a man who collected almost every @entity2 scratchcard since they first went on sale in 1994 could have missed out on millions of pounds as he refuses to scratch off the silver films to find out if he has won			1
@entity6 , 42 , boasts the world 's biggest scratchcard collection , but thousands of his 100,000 - strong hoard remain unscratched , much to the annoyance of his partner @entity11			1
@entity6 , who has spent £ 80,000 over the last 20 years on buying both used and unscratched cards , has left 10,000 with the silver film still intact - and almost all of them have now expired			1
@entity6 with some examples from his 100,000 - strong collection of scratchcards the hoarder has dedicated an entire room in his @entity21 home to storing the cards			1
he said : ' i ’ve got a designated room in my house where i keep them all in boxes so i know exactly which ones are where '			0
@entity6 , whose severe arthritis prevents him from working , has an extensive collection which includes complete sets of special edition cards from @entity35 to @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
but the collector now plans to call time on his hoarding and is putting his cards up for sale for £ 500,000			1
@entity6 and his partner @entity11 with one of @entity6 's special edition @entity38 scratchcards he said : ' i want to give someone else the chance to own this unique gathering			2
' it ’s taken half my life to build up and i want it to go to a good home			0
' @entity6 , who has always been an avid collector , began the hobby in the 1980s when he used to gather phone cards			2
but this particular collection was brought to an end with the rise of mobile phones towards the end of the decade			0
his obsession turned to scratchcards when a friend gave him a batch of 400 in 1994			0
@entity6 ( right ) has an extensive collection which is only missing one card - the 1994 @entity70 special edition he said : ' i was given around 400 from a close friend when they were first released by the @entity2 in 1994			1
' after that i went into a shop and i saw a container that was bulging with used scratch cards so i asked the woman behind the counter if i could have them			0
' from there i asked a few different retailers if they could keep the used cards for me and all of a sudden my collection became enormous			0
@entity6 bought around 90,000 of the cards in his collection after they had already been used			2
but there are also 10,000 fresh cards which remain unscratched , much to the frustration of @entity6 's partner @entity11 , as the six - month limit on the cards means they are now all out of date			2
@entity6 stands in front of his 100,000 - strong collection of scratchcards , accumulated over 20 years despite his best efforts , the collection is incomplete , as , he said , there is one card that has evaded him - he has been unable to get hold of the first @entity70 scratchcard from 1994			1
' apart from one i know of , i ’m pretty sure i ’ve managed to get hold of all of the cards ever made and i ’ve spent around £ 80,000 in doing so			0
' but @entity6 's partner @entity11 has had enough of his hobby , which has proved fruitless due to his refusal to tarnish the cards by scratching them			0
@entity6 and his partner @entity11 , who has put up with his collection taking over an entire room in their @entity21 home he said : ' every so often @entity11 looks at me angrily and asks me when am i going to get rid of them but she knows i ’ve had a lot of fun collecting them			2
' i still have just under 10,000 that have not been touched - but sadly they would n’t be valid anymore even if they were winners because there ’s a six - month expiry date on them			0
' now i wo n’t be sitting on a pile of money			0
' @entity6 now plans to sell his collection intact , but hopes the next owner will scratch the cards so he can find out how much he could have won over the last 20 years			1
he said : ' i ’ve been told it could be worth up to £ 5million , but i ’m only asking for around £ 500,000 .			1

@entity6 has 100,000 - strong hoard of @entity2 scratchcards
collection accumulated since 1994 could be worth £ 5 million
on sale for £ 500,000 - hopes next owner discovers what he could have won
