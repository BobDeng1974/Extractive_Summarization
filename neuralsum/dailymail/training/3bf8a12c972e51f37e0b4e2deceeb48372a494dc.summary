by @entity0 published : 07:52 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 4 april 2013 the world 's first zoo - born male orangutan to be released into the wild has been killed by a poisonous snake after just 17 months in the jungle			1
seven - year - old @entity7 made history in 2011 when @entity9 in @entity10 decided he had the right temperament to be released into his natural rain forest habitat in @entity13			1
but park rangers on the island of @entity16 were horrified to find his body in the jungle , where he had easily adapted to his surroundings			1
poisoned : the seven - year - old orangutan became the first zoo - born male to be released into the wild in 2011 however an investigation has now begun into whether his background of being born and raised for six years in a zoo left him without the basic instincts needed to protect himself from the dangers of the jungle			1
' we have been keeping track of @entity7 ever since he was released into a protected part of the rainforest and he seemed to be doing well , ' said a spokesman for @entity13 's orang - utan rehabilitation department			1
' we found a snake bite and tests have since proved he died from toxic poisoning			1
' his death might also have been due to what zoo officials said was his independent and curious nature			0
instincts : officials are looking into whether @entity7 's upbringing at @entity9 left him without the basic instincts to cope in the jungle whether his curiosity had led to him approaching and perhaps trying to handle a toxic snake is a question that no - one will be able to answer			1
a spokeswoman for @entity9 said : ' all the staff are devastated at this loss , but we 're glad that @entity7 was able to spend part of his life in the wild			2
' @entity7 was transported from @entity9 in october 2011 to @entity62 in @entity16 as part of the @entity66 orang - utan re-introduction programme to establish a new population of the crtically - endangered species in the wild			1
he was born at @entity9 in june 2005 to mother @entity70 and father @entity73			2
zoo officials said @entity70 was an excellent first - time mother and doted on @entity7 , the first of the third generation of orang - utans born at the zoo			0
he was chosen for the release programme because of his age and temperament			0
officials said he had reached the natural age of dispersal for a male orang - utan and was confident , curious and independent			0
the world 's first female orang - utan to be released into the wild was @entity89 , who was also born at @entity9			2
she was released in the same area as @entity7 in 2006 and is said to have adapted well to her surroundings			0
@entity13 has four extremely dangerous snakes , the venom of which can bring about death in an hour or so			0
venomous : the black cobra ( pictured ) is one of a number of highly dangerous snakes found in @entity13 , along with the pit viper , the king cobra and the banded krait they include : the banded krait , the bite of which causes muscle weakness , loss of co-ordination and eventually respiratory paralysis			2
victims have only a 50 per cent chance of surviving			0
the black spitting cobra and the king cobra , the bite of both causing pain , muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis			0
the pit viper , which causes great pain , bleeding and tissue damage , and the tree snake , which also causes death through paralysis of heart and lungs .			0
