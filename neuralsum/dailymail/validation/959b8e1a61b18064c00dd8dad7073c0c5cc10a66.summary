an @entity1 agent was allegedly recruited by a terrorist mastermind in @entity3 and sent back to @entity4 in a plot to launch a devastating attack against his handlers			1
the agent was recruited by @entity1 as an undercover informant within the radical @entity10 community and he then travelled to @entity3 where he became part of a jihadist group			1
but he apparently double - crossed his @entity4 handlers and returned to @entity14 with plans to launch an ' insider attack ' in the capital			1
the @entity18 has been aware of the alleged plot for more than a year but agreed to previous requests from the security services not to publish the story for ' national security ' reasons			0
parts of the plot were reported in a story in @entity18 last year , in which we revealed that the jihadist , who has a @entity4 passport , had plans to attack @entity14 and that @entity31 had been briefed about the details			2
this newspaper is aware of the man 's identity and further details of the investigation but are not printing them for legal reasons			0
a long undercover operation was run by @entity1 to try to identify linked individuals who might be travelling back from @entity3 to launch similar attacks but this investigation has now concluded , meaning we can now report the fact that he was a potential ' double agent '			1
the revelations come as the terror threat in the @entity4 continues to be ' severe ' but as @entity1 faces difficult questions about its tactic of recruiting agents who are known @entity10 extremists			2
supporters of @entity52 , the @entity53 executioner known as @entity54 , have claimed that @entity1 harassed him and similar allegations have been made by the family of @entity57 , one of the killers of fusilier @entity59			2
the security services refuse to answer such questions because they stick by a strict policy to ' neither confirm nor deny ' whether individuals have been approached or recruited â€“ a policy they stick to even after suspects have been accused of serious crimes			0
however , @entity18 can disclose that the man worked for @entity1 for a period before he decided to travel abroad in 2012			2
@entity1 faces difficult questions about its tactic of recruiting agents who are known terrorists , while supporters of @entity52 ( pictured ) have claimed that @entity1 harassed him investigators believe he met a terrorist mastermind with designs on attacking the @entity76 who encouraged him to plan an attack			1
back in @entity4 , information suggested he began plotting to attack the @entity1 handlers who had recruited him and set about trying to buy automatic weapons in this country or abroad			1
the alleged ' double agent ' was apparently planning to use the firearms to stage a murderous attack on the public in an echo of the @entity93 shopping mall massacre last year , sources said			0
he remained in contact with his jihadi controller , a terrorist mastermind who is thought to have established links to @entity4			1
the agent also joined up with another extremist and they approached two other men for help in obtaining the equipment , but these other men did not agree to help them			0
@entity1 were sufficiently concerned by an intercepted communication they received that they launched an emergency operation to apprehend the man			1
@entity111 's firearms unit was sent to @entity14 when investigations suggested he was close to launching his attack			2
the man was detained for questioning and remains in custody			2
however , no firearms were discovered linking him to a plot and it appears the security services ' fears of an imminent attack were unfounded			0
there has been growing concern from within the security services that there could be ' blow - back ' from the conflict in @entity3 , where hundreds of young @entity4 have joined the fighting			1
eleven months after the agent was allegedly planning his attack , police and @entity1 rounded up another cell linked to @entity135 also allegedly planning a gun attack in @entity14			1
five men are currently awaiting trial			0
some details of how @entity1 go about recruitment have been released in recent months as part of an investigation by the parliamentary @entity143			0
they often approach individuals they are investigating in order to try to recruit them as agents , known as @entity149			0
they then assess them on their suitability , their access to intelligence , personal qualities and their motivation for working with @entity1			0
recruiting a target is seen as a ' positive outcome ' as it means they have reduced the risk , gained increased ' visibility ' of their activity and have a new source of intelligence .			0
