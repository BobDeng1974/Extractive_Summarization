babies conceived through @entity1 may be twice as likely to develop autism , according to new research			1
children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally			1
assisted reproductive technology ( @entity9 ) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body , including @entity1 , artificial insemination and surrogacy			1
during @entity1 - the most popular @entity9 treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised , which can lead to multiple births			1
babies conceived through @entity1 ( pictured ) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally , a study found			1
but this could be due to the complications of @entity1 , such as multiple births researchers explained they found an association between @entity1 and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder , according to @entity32 news			1
the higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with @entity1 , not the treatment itself , they said			1
after taking into account factors such as the mother 's education and multiple births , researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old			1
and they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child			1
this means @entity1 using a single - egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism , experts said			1
the study involved nearly six million children born from 1997 to 2007			0
the team , led by @entity61 , a professor of social sciences at @entity63 in @entity64 , collected data on 5.9 million @entity67 births , including 48,865 infants conceived through assisted reproduction , and 32,922 children with autism			2
autism is mainly caused by a child ’s genes , a major study of @entity74 twins has found			2
scientists said that , in the average boy or girl with autism , genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness			0
the research , by @entity85 , found the condition is highly inheritable			0
controversial research linking autism with the @entity90 jab has been widely discredited , but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution			0
with cases of autism much more common today than in the past , many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles			0
but the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics			0
they compared the incidence of autism in births that involved advanced infertility treatment such as @entity1 and those that did n't			2
professor @entity61 said this was the largest study looking at this relationship that has ever been carried out			0
the results are not a condemnation of @entity1 technology , as the study did not prove a cause - and - effect link , he said			2
he added : ' there is an association between ivf and autism , but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use @entity1 , for example , age and social status , this association is lessened significantly , ' the remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with @entity1 , he said			1
he added that there was no significant increased risk of the disorder for children of women who gave birth to one child			2
he said : ' knowing that one can largely reduce the risk of autism by restricting the procedure to single - egg transfer is important for women who can then make better informed decisions			2
' the research was published online in the @entity149			0
the news comes after a major study published this week found genetics are the main cause of a child 's autism , not lifestyle			0
scientists from @entity85 said that , in the average boy or girl with autism , genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness			0
controversial research linking autism with the @entity90 jab has been widely discredited , but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution			0
autism is mainly caused by a child ’s genes , rather than lifestyle factors , a study published this month found			0

children conceived using infertility treatments were more likely to develop autism than children conceived naturally , @entity63 study found
these treatments include @entity1 , artificial insemination and surrogacy
experts : study shows a link - but does not prove - that @entity1 causes autism
higher risk could be explained by complications of @entity1 , like multiple births
there was no extra risk if a woman did not have a multiple birth
