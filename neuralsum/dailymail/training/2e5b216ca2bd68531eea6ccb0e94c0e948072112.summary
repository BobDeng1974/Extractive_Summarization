by @entity0 spinning wind turbines might soon be confined to the recycling bin			1
that 's because @entity5 company @entity4 have revealed their innovative design for a new wind turbine that can operate even in low wing conditions			1
known as the @entity10 , it uses two pairs of wings to generate power even when the wind speed drops to nine miles ( 14 km ) per hour			1
scroll down to watch video the product is part of @entity4 's @entity18 and mimics the natural beating of a bird 's wings			1
as one wing rises the other drops so that they help each other move even when the wind speed is low			0
the shape of the wings means they generate lift when wind passes over them			2
the motion of the wings is turned into electricity by an integrated circuit motor			2
as one wing rises the other falls , so it can operate even in conditions when wind speed is low but it 's the effectiveness of the turbine to operate at low wind speeds that really makes it impressive			0
it 's possible that it could one day be used as an alternative to modern wind turbines			1
@entity4 's @entity10 is the first flapping turbine of its kind the @entity10 is an evolution of @entity4 's @entity50			1
the @entity50 's revolutionary design allows it to start , fly and land autonomously			0
its wings not only beat up and down , they also twist at specific angles , providing the ultra-light model with ' excellent aerodynamic qualities and extreme agility '			0
controlled by a radio handset , it can also simply glide through the skies if left to its own devices			0
steering is achieved when the @entity50 , which weighs just 450 grams , moves its tail and turns its head from side - to - side			0
inspired by the herring seagull , scientists at technology firm @entity4 control the up / down flapping motion of the wings by spinning two wheels inside the robot 's torso .			2

@entity5 company @entity4 has unveiled their @entity10
*proposed* as an alternative to large wind turbines to generate electricity
two pairs of *opposing* wings generate power at winds as low as 9 *mph*
the motion of its wings is *similar* to that of a bird
