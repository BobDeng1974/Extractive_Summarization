dolphins are said to share the human traits of bravery , jealousy and even a sense of humour			0
but it seems they share some worrying vices as well			0
scientists were amazed at footage of the mammals apparently getting ' high ' with the help of a toxic puffer fish			1
@entity14 sillies : dolphins have been filmed eating toxic puffer fish , which when digested in small doses can have a ' narcotic - like effect ' in an extraordinary scene filmed for a new tv series , the dolphins are shown gently passing the fish between them			1
experts believe the creatures are using the toxins , which emerge from the puffer fish as part of its defence mechanism , for their own enjoyment			1
they nudge the fish with their snouts and as the toxin is released into the water , they seem to lapse into a trance - like state			1
at one point the dolphins are seen floating just underneath the water 's surface , apparently mesmerised by their own reflections			0
the dolphins were filmed gently playing with the puffer , passing it between each other for 20 to 30 minutes at a time , unlike the fish they had caught as prey which were swiftly torn apart			2
the footage , from a forthcoming @entity51 show called @entity16 : spy in the @entity53 , was taken by wildlife filmmaker @entity54 â€“ who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens			1
mr @entity54 designed underwater cameras disguised as squid , tuna and even other dolphins			1
toxic trance : the footage , captured in the tv series @entity16 : spy in the @entity53 , shows the dolphins deliberately putting the puffer fish in their mouths ( left ) and afterward , appearing intoxicated hanging near the surface ( right ) zoologist and series producer @entity70 said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way			1
he added : ' we saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves , very gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset the fish too much or kill it			2
' as a result the fish released various toxins as a defence			0
' the dolphins then seemed to be mesmerised			0
' he insisted that the scene could n't have been a one - off encounter , saying : ' the dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately handling them with care			2
' fun - loving fish : the dolphins were filmed watching their reflections just below the surface in the series which used cameras disguised as sea creatures including a dolphin to get a glimpse of the mysterious life of the mammal never seen before : viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water , as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once in the up close footage the @entity51 series follows the success of @entity115 : @entity116 , which used similar tactics of disguised cameras , documentary producer mr @entity54 was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favourite species			1
as well as the @entity128 , the @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 have also been created for different spying roles , with each fitted with @entity131 cameras to capture life under the sea			2
with the help of the cameras , viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water , as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once			2
hundreds of hours of filming were put into the programme which will be narrated by @entity142			0
some 900 hours of raw footage collected over a year from around the world including @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
the puffer fish footage was filmed in waters near @entity152			1
the film crew also dived some 1,500 times , spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the @entity156 in all types of weather			0
sea spies : the disguised cameras included @entity126 ( pictured ) , @entity125 and @entity127 to spy on other deep sea species secretive sea creatures : with the use of the secret cameras and human dive crews , a huge amount of raw footage was collected such as this close - up with a bottlenose dolphin speaking of the project , mr @entity54 said : ' unlike penguin - cams , this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast - moving dolphins , often out in the deep ocean			1
' the dolphins were very curious about their new neighbours and allowed them into their lives			0
' @entity54 's last project , @entity181 , took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year			0
the first of the two - part series will air on thursday , january 2 at 8pm on @entity51 .			0

the footage features in tv series @entity16 : spy in the @entity53
series uses several cameras disguised as sea creatures to film dolphins
the mammals were filmed in a trance - like state after eating puffer fish
