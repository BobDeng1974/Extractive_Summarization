battle : @entity9 , 46 ( left ) accepted £ 10.35m from her ex-husband @entity10 ( right ) in the belief it was half his fortune			1
but his firm @entity11 was later valued wildly higher , and his stake was said to be worth £ 150m ms @entity9 tried to secure more money from her ex-husband but her bid was rejected , despite a top judge agreeing he had ' lied ' and ' misled ' the first hearing			1
today ms @entity9 was given the go - ahead to challenge that rejection in @entity35 's highest court			1
the @entity8 , which was founded in 2009 and sits opposite the houses of @entity37 , will consider the case next june because it raises wider issues about the @entity35 legal system			2
her barrister @entity41 told the @entity14 : ' she was cheated into an agreement			2
if someone dupes you into a deal , why should you be held to a deal ? ' this was a case of equality			0
it was a long marriage			0
all the assets had been acquired during the course of the marriage and each party had made their full contribution			0
' part of the wife ’s case was that she was busy making post-separation efforts as well			0
she had the unusual task of lifelong care of the parties ’ disabled child			1
' popular : @entity11 provides remote access software to 4,000 companies and was said to be worth £ 460m the couple married in 1993 and separated in 2010 , divorcing two years later			1
they lived in @entity67 , @entity68 , and had three children as they built a substantial fortune			0
mr @entity10 ran his company from a business park in @entity74 , near @entity75 , while mrs @entity9 ran an autism charity , the court heard			1
in july 2012 they agreed a settlement which handed ms @entity9 £ 10.35million in cash and properties			1
she would also gain 30 per cent of proceeds from her ex-husband 's shares in his company when it was floated on the stock market			0
mr @entity10 would take less in cash and properties at £ 5.64million , but retain 70 per cent of his shares in the digital firm when it was floated			2
the row then ignited over how much mr @entity10 's company was worth			0
used by high - end firms including the bank @entity93 and the airline @entity94 , @entity11 was founded in 1999 and has offices in cities including @entity15 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
in the original court action , the firm was valued at between £ 31.5million and £ 47.25million while mr @entity10 's shares were said to be worth £ 7million			1
but it later emerged the company was said to be worth £ 460million - putting mr @entity10 's stake at £ 150million , the court heard			1
landmark : ms @entity9 's case will be heard at the @entity8 , opposite the houses of @entity37 high court judge sir @entity109 refused to ' set aside ' the agreement and restart the process , even though he found mr. @entity10 had been ' dishonest ' about his wealth			1
he took the decision because he said it would not have made any substantial difference to the settlement			0
@entity10 founded @entity11 in 1999 and it has now grown into one of the biggest firms of its kind in the world			2
it provides secure remote access software for large companies , so their employees can get onto complex internal systems reliably from their laptops in airports or hotels			0
the technology is used by more than 4,000 firms including the bank @entity93 , sports channel @entity134 and the airlines @entity135 and @entity94			0
an article in the @entity140 in august 2012 - a month after the @entity138 ' divorce settlement - suggested it could be worth as much as $ 1billion ( £ 613million )			2
but the firm 's finances are also secretive and difficult to define for sure			2
a spokesman told the newspaper at the time : ' the company does n’t comment on rumour or speculation			0
' she escalated her fight to the @entity14 but it agreed , throwing out ms @entity9 ’s case by a two to one majority			1
she was ordered to pay the appeal 's £ 50,000 legal costs , including those of her ex-husband			0
that was despite the @entity14 saying mr @entity10 's behaviour was ' deplorable ' and his deceit had been ' deliberate and dishonest '			2
lord justice @entity160 added mr @entity10 ' had lied to the court and misled both the wife and the judge			0
' mr @entity10 did not deny that he had misled the court , but insisted the settlement reached was a fair one			0
the @entity8 case will rest on whether the millionaire 's dishonesty made the whole of the original divorce settlement ' unjust '			0
ms @entity9 's lawyer @entity171 , of solicitors @entity172 , said : ' we are very pleased that the @entity8 has agreed that this is a case which requires consideration at the highest level			1
' dishonesty in any legal proceedings should not be tolerated ; the family court should not be an exception			0
' there are numerous legal arguments to be had before the @entity8 but we hope that ultimately justice will be done and will be seen to be done			0
' mr @entity10 's solicitors , @entity186 and @entity187 at @entity188 , said : ' with the @entity8 due to consider the details of @entity10 and mrs @entity9 's divorce , we feel that it would be inappropriate to prejudice those deliberations by taking relevant arguments to the media before they are presented to the @entity8			2
' the fact remains that the @entity14 upheld the @entity196 's judgement that the agreement struck between @entity10 and mrs @entity9 was fair and had not caused her any loss			1

@entity9 , 46 , was married to @entity11 founder charles for 17 years
she accepted £ 10.3m in 2012 on the basis it was around half his fortune
but his share in the firm was estimated at around £ 150m soon afterwards
@entity14 ruled he had lied - but refused to change ex-wife 's payout
she will now challenge that decision in landmark battle at @entity35 's highest court
marriage was equal , she said - and she now cares for their disabled child
