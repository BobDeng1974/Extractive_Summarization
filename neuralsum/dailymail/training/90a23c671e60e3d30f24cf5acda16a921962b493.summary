usually , by the time the final vote takes place , many voters become fed up with the election			0
and often the difficulty of staying enthusiastic is made worse by the whole process starting up again not long afterwards			0
the @entity13 presidential candidate was asked the cheeky question after being visited on the campaign trail by his wife , son and three grandchildren ( pictured ) but it seems having the attention span of a four - year - old makes it even harder to maintain an interest			1
@entity24 - the @entity13 candidate for this year 's election battle for the @entity26 - has told how his grandson has already asked whether he has won the race			1
four - year - old @entity29 was reported to have questioned his grandfather immediately after he visited him on the campaign trail in @entity32 , @entity33			0

answers varied from the comfortable couches on their grandfather 's bus , to a giant jar of peanut @entity67 's			1
@entity24 is hoping to woo white conservatives who shunned him in the @entity13 primaries , but are now crucial to his quest to unseat president @entity38 in november and @entity24 's grandchildren were also eager to show their support for the 65 - year - old			2
the @entity13 candidate fielded a question from a reporter asking who @entity77 , his grandson , thinks will win			0
mr @entity24 then asked the little boy himself who , apparently shy , pointed at his grandfather			2
