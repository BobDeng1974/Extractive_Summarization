@entity0 must win the @entity1 this season , or their star man will surely want out			1
who knows what is going on in @entity7 ’s mind but just put yourself in his boots for a second : what do you think is going on in his head when he takes a look at the @entity15 table ? during his little injury break i suspect he will be wondering whether he should be playing at a bigger club , a club capable of a genuine title challenge			1
@entity7 , pictured in action against @entity21 , may be wondering whether his future is at @entity0 the @entity23 international has shined for the @entity25 so far this term , but the club are still outside the top four he ’s had the season of his life so far – he ’s been shining virtually every week for @entity0			1
yet when he looks at the table he sees that his team is not even in the top four			0
how will @entity7 feel , having played so well , worked so hard , shown world - class quality , to see that those efforts have only managed to take @entity0 to fifth in the table ? in the same way nobody really knows what was going on in @entity40 ’s mind last tuesday when he was putting his stamp on that @entity43 tie , i ca n’t be sure what is going on in @entity7 ’s head			2
but i ’m guessing he will be feeling exasperated and frustrated , asking himself what he has to do to get this side challenging for the title			0
@entity7 , pictured grabbing hold of team - mate @entity51 , missed the 5 - 0 victory over @entity53 on sunday will @entity7 be happy staying on the @entity55 train where the destination is @entity57 ? do n’t get me wrong - i ’m certain @entity0 will finish in the top four			1
and they ’re still in the @entity1 where a kind draw could take them all the way to a final where anything can happen over 90 or 120 minutes			0
but if @entity0 do n’t win the @entity1 where will that leave @entity7 ? will he be happy staying on the @entity55 train – destination @entity57 , calling at @entity65 and @entity66 ? he ’s bigger than that of course			1
he ’s enjoying his football at @entity0 , some might argue			0
just like he ’d enjoy his football at a club that wins big trophies			0
others will wonder how i can write this stuff after the @entity25 have just won 5 - 0			2
it was against @entity53 – it ’s standard behaviour for @entity0 to batter weak teams more often than not			2
@entity81 wins a penalty for @entity0 after he is fouled by @entity53 goalkeeper @entity83 per @entity84 congratulates @entity85 after the @entity0 youngster scored his side 's fifth goal @entity89 was also on target in the win for @entity0 against a poor @entity53 side at the @entity93 from the sidelines or sat in his living room @entity7 would have heard the ‘ @entity98 ’ of the @entity0 fans when their team was strolling to victory on sunday			1
he might think it ’s brilliant from the fans ; or he might realise he ’s at a club where standards and expectations are so low those fans are satisfied with a bit of keep ball when a terrible team comes to the @entity93			2
quite what he made of the last 20 minutes of the game turning into a testimonial with everyone desperately passing to young @entity81 hoping for him to score a goal is anyone ’s guess			0
it ’s all very sweet and nice from @entity0 to look after a young player , but a bigger win was easily achievable , and would have landed the @entity25 in the top four			1
that would have been a huge statement			0
the elite challenge themselves – they do n’t settle for fourth - best , it ’s not in their mentality			0
that ’s why @entity124 left in the end			0
@entity7 has an opportunity to do something this season not even @entity124 did for @entity0 – lead the @entity25 ’ charge to @entity1 success			2
if they do n’t achieve that glory , are all @entity0 fans confident their star man will want to stay ? and if @entity0 do achieve @entity136 glory this season , will all 11 players get statues outside the @entity93 ? i do hope so .			1

surely @entity7 will want out if @entity0 do not triumph in @entity136 ?
he has been the club 's star man , but @entity25 are not even in the top four
@entity0 should have beaten @entity53 by a bigger *margin* **...** but players were happy to turn the @entity15 clash into a testimonial
@entity7 would have heard the ' @entity98 ' from the @entity0 *faithful* at the end **...** are expectations so low , they *'re* happy with keep - ball against a poor side ?
