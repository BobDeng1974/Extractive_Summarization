by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has slated @entity3 for being ' too aggressive ' as the @entity5 's world was turned upside down in @entity6			1
for the second successive grand prix , @entity2 's race was brought to a premature end on the opening lap , following a first corner - shunt with @entity12 rookie @entity3			1
in the @entity14 @entity13 at @entity15 , @entity2 was unfortunately taken out by @entity16 following the @entity18 's frightening smash into a metal guardrail , with the 33 - year - old simply in the wrong place at the wrong time			2
out : @entity2 crashes in the first curve of the @entity6 @entity24 in @entity25 crash : @entity2 ( left ) collides with @entity27 driver @entity3 ( right ) on the first corner at @entity25 , @entity2 was left in no doubt the impetuosity of youth wrecked his race , resulting in him being flipped over as the accident unfolded			1
mercifully for @entity2 , the rollbar on top of his @entity36 did its job , with his car eventually righting itself , allowing him to walk away unharmed			1
@entity2 , though , was left fuming with @entity3 as he said : ' when i turned into the corner suddenly another car hit me on my tyres and just flipped me over			1
' it was very strange because i did n't know there was a car there , but @entity3 should know i was there as he was behind			0
@entity49 : the high - speed crash saw @entity2 's car flipped upside down sparks flying : the view from @entity3 's car as he crashes into @entity2 ' for me he was too aggressive			1
i was doing my line			0
if you 're doing your line and you 're in front then the guy behind needs to choose and needs to brake			0
' if i see someone then i will consider doing whatever i can to not be involved in an accident , but it was impossible to see him there			0
' he could see and he knew there were two cars there			0
this is not the first time he was in an accident on the first lap. ' most of the time these young drivers want to win races at the first corner			2
if you take most accidents , they happen with them			0
' i 've not spoken to him , but if i do , i 'll tell him to take it easy because i 'm not the only one losing out , he does as well			0
relief : the @entity5 seemed to be ok after the heavy collision sweeping up : @entity2 gets out of his car before it is collected and taken away from the track ' i hope it 's enough for him to understand to take it easy a little bit more in the next race			2
' @entity3 , however , felt @entity2 left him with no room as he said : ' i feel if i 'd had somewhere to go there would n't have been contact with @entity2			1
' i did my best to try and avoid the accident , but there was n't much else i could do			0
' racing director @entity98 also exonerated the 21 - year - old @entity99 , stating : ' @entity2 was on the outside and probably did n't see @entity3 , who was on the inside line and had nowhere to go			1
' @entity3 was quite blameless in the accident , so it 's even more annoying it destroyed his chances of finishing in the top four			2
' disappointment : @entity2 revealed he ' very frustrated ' by the incident as for @entity2 's moment when he was rolled over , he conceded that was a scary sensation			1
' i 've never flipped in a racing car before , only a go - kart , but it was a very strange feeling to see everything upside down , ' said @entity2			0
' but i did n't have any impact , so when the car stopped i was 100 per cent fine , but just so disappointed			0

@entity2 's @entity36 flipped over after contact from young @entity99
@entity119 blames young drivers for most early crashes
@entity12 deny that rookie @entity3 was to blame
