by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 7 november 2013 a @entity2 farmer has cultivated a ' tree of fire ' that has yielded over 1,000 of the world 's hottest chillies			0
@entity7 , 55 , has a glut of the @entity10 chillies on her hands and just one of the pungent red fruits is thought to contain more heat than eight vindaloo curries			1
they measure an eye - watering 1.2 million units on the @entity20 heat scale , compared to a mere 30,000 in the average red chilli			1
chilli out : @entity7 with a bowl of the @entity23			0
the chilli is grown from the @entity10 , native to north - east @entity26 but given a @entity2 twist by @entity28 on her farm in @entity30 , @entity31 the @entity32 , originally native to north - east @entity26 rather than south - west @entity33 , usually has 800,000 scoville units - the scale used to measure chilli heat			1
but their heat has been turned up this year thanks to the red hot summer			2
mrs @entity7 has now submitted an application to @entity41			2
she started growing the chillies in 2005 and sells the wickedly fiery treats at the local farmer 's market - eight for three pounds to the bravest customers			1
while handling the dangerous fruit the farmer two pairs of latex gloves and a plastic mackintosh to protect her skin from the heat			2
she also advises that people wear goggles or glasses while preparing the chilli and to tie long hair back			1
just a small taste can cause burning eyes , a streaming nose , and uncontrollable hiccups			0
warning signs : the chillis come with there own caution , warning customers of their ferocity while ( right ) mrs @entity7 smiles next to this years ' bumper haul hope there are no holes in those gloves : @entity74 hot chillis like @entity10 contains capsaicin which , although sweat - inducingly hot , actually relaxes blood vessels and can reduce blood pressure safety first : farmers are forced to wear two layers of latex gloves while picking the fruit			1
of course , a metal bowl is probably safer @entity7 , 55 , who originally hails from @entity84 , said : " it really is astonishing to think about how much heat is on this plant			0
' it is holding more heat than any other i can think of			0
the most chillies we have ever had on a plant is about 700			0
' i believe this plant has over 1,000 chillies on it so extra care will need to be taken when we pick all the fruit from it			2
small beginnings : the innocent looking seedling ( right ) will go on to produce chillis 120 times hotter than a jalepeno while mrs @entity7 ( left ) smiles next to one of the fully grown plants ' not only that , but they are much hotter this year than ever before with an average reading of 1.2 million on the @entity20			1
' this could be because of the warm summer as the hotter the weather , the hotter the chilli			0
' the @entity10 chillies are so full of chemicals they can be quite dangerous , if their skin is intact they are ok , but if not , precautions must be taken			1
' when i am picking or preparing them i wear two layers of latex gloves and i change them every 15 minutes as the chemicals will seep through and inflame the skin			2
' i have applied to the @entity41 and am waiting to hear back from them			0
' the @entity126 scale is named after its creator @entity126			1
his method , devised in 1912 , is known as the @entity129			0
the higher the number , the more potent the chill : - spice up your life : chilli peppers come in all shapes , sizes and hotness			0
