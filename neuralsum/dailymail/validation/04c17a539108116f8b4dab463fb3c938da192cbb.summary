they say money can corrupt even the most honest of people			1
now one social psychologist has revealed a series of experiments that shows this adage to be true			0
instead of transforming people into a charitable benefactors , professor @entity7 believes money causes people to break the rules at the expense of others			1
professor @entity7 from the @entity14 , has revealed several experiments in which the rich struggled with empathy and generosity towards others , compared with their poorer companions ' it makes you more attuned to your own interests , your own desires , your own welfare , ' the @entity14 , researcher told @entity26 at the @entity27			1
' it isolates you in certain ways from other people psychologically and materially			1
you prioritise your own needs and your own goals and become less attuned to those around you			0
in one experiment , professor @entity7 spent an afternoon going back and forth over a pedestrian crossing in @entity37			1
he found that none of the least expensive cars broke the law , while almost 50 per cent of the most expensive car drivers sped across the pedestrian crossing			1
in another recent study , professor @entity7 brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab , and flipped a coin to assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged monopoly game			1
the rich players collected twice the salary when they passed @entity52 , and they were able to roll both dice instead of one , so they got to move around the board more			1
money isolates people psychologically and materially , according to recent research			1
as a result they prioritise their own needs and goals and become less attuned to those around them hidden cameras revealed , over the course of 15 minutes , the rich player showing signs of dominance , smacking the board with their piece and talking loudly			0
the rich players also became ruder toward the other person , less sensitive to the plight of the poor players , and more demonstrative of their material success			2
the feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine			2
it increases the levels of testosterone and its by - product 3 - androstanediol in both men and women			0
this in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine , the brain 's reward system called the nucleus accumbens , which can be very addictive			0
like cocaine , scientists now believe power can lead to too much dopamine causing more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience			0
' when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of @entity101 they talked about what they 'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game , ' professor @entity7 said in a recent @entity106			1
' they became far less attuned to all those different features of the situation , including that flip of a coin that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position in the first place			0
' and that 's a really , really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of advantage			0
' other scientists have conducted similar studies to back up the findings			0
last year , after undergoing psychological testing to measure individual differences , including honesty , a group of volunteers in @entity123 played the ' dictator game '			2
in the game , they were given complete control over deciding pay outs to themselves and their followers			2
the leaders had the choice of making pro or anti-social decisions - the latter resulting in awarding less money to the group but more to the leader 's own earnings			2
the findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour			0
but , over time , even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power , according to the @entity149 in @entity123			0
professor @entity7 , however , says not all hope is lost for the wealthy			1
' we 've been finding in our own laboratory research that small psychological interventions , small changes to people 's values , small nudges in certain directions , can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy			2
' for instance , reminding people of the benefits of cooperation , or the advantages of community , cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian as poor people			0
' in one study , volunteers watched a brief video , 46 seconds long , about childhood poverty that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them			0
' after watching this video , an hour later , rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person , a stranger , as someone who 's poor , ' said professor @entity7 .			1

this is according to @entity7 from @entity14
his tests reveal money isolates people psychologically and materially
in a rigged game of monopoly , richer players were rude and dominant
another study found people in better cars were more likely to break law
