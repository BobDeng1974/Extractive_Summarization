by @entity1 reporter published : 14:28 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 14:43 est , 9 april 2013 police have detained a 14 - year - old suspected of participating in the brutal gang rape of an @entity6 student inside a moving public transit van in @entity8			1
@entity10 newspaper @entity9 reported yesterday that the teen was apprehended in a hiding place in downtown @entity8 on sunday			1
he is the fourth suspect to be taken into custody in the march 30 attack on the @entity6 and her @entity17 companion , who were held for six hours , robbed and beaten before being dumped by the roadside			1
the other three suspects , aged 20 - 22 , include the van 's driver			2
the report says the teenager was the van 's money - taker			2
it says he has acknowledged robbing the couple and beating the man but denied taking part in the rape			0
a few minutes after the pair of tourists boarded the mini-bus , the operators ordered the other passengers to get off and inflicted a ' party of evil ' on the couple			2
the three assailants took turns raping the woman and beating the man , whom they handcuffed and sometimes struck with a metal crowbar , police investigator @entity63 said yesterday			2
the men split up the driving , ending up in @entity8 's sister city of @entity72 across , where they went on a spending spree with the foreigners ' credit cards			1
once they hit the limit on both cards , spending around $ 500 at gas stations and convenience stores , the suspects drove the pair back to @entity8 and forced the woman to fetch another credit card , mr @entity63 said			1
he said that she did not dare call for help at this point ' because the young man was still under the suspects ' control and she feared something even worse might happen to him '			2
around six hours after they were kidnapped , the tourists - both in their early 20s - were dumped by the side of highway 30 miles away from @entity8			2
they managed to reach a consulate , where staff helped them contact police			0
the woman has returned home , while the man is still in @entity10 helping officers with their inquiries			1
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity37 have been arrested on suspicion of the crime			0
' the victims recognised the three without a shadow of a doubt , ' mr @entity63 said			0

left to right : @entity41 , @entity35 and @entity42 , who allegedly raped a foreign tourist in a minibus in @entity8 on march 30 , 2013 it has been reported that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the @entity123 in @entity8 early on saturday many are now asking whether @entity8 authorities , who have succeeded in cracking down on much of the city 's drug violence , are up to the task of protecting the waves of tourists expected to flood the city during the @entity53 and @entity133			1
some 2million people are also expected to flock to the city in late july for @entity135 , a @entity137 pilgrimage that @entity138 is scheduled to attend			0
observers said the attack came as a particular shock given that safety has improved at least in the city 's tourist - friendly seaside neighbourhoods			1

' @entity149 is our @entity146			0
' three men boarded the minibus after the woman and her boyfriend got on and forced all the other passengers off , @entity8 police said police have said a @entity10 woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects the suspects allegedly rented their van , which seats about a dozen people and has dark tinted windows , from the vehicle 's owner , who has not been linked to the attack			1
@entity8 's van services are widely reviled for their precarious safety conditions and reckless driving , as well as their links to organised crime			1
some vans are run by militias largely composed of former police and firemen who control large swaths of the city 's slums and run clandestine transportation and other services			0
in general , tourists avoid the vans and opt for regular buses or taxis			0
