by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 15:41 est , 23 july 2013 meeting the first grandchild is an important and moving occasion for any grandparent			0
but for @entity5 and @entity6 , it was more momentous than most			1
for as this middle - class couple from @entity9 gazed down at their own flesh and blood , they were looking into the scrunched up face of the future @entity14			0
@entity5 and @entity6 arrived at @entity16 's hospital in @entity17 just after 3pm today			1
and of course @entity5 , an attractive woman with a keen fashion sense , was sure to look perfectly polished for this high profile moment			2
perhaps giving a nod to the gender of the baby , @entity5 chose a belted silk tea dress in a muted blue shade by @entity27 designer @entity26			1
it is no longer on sale at the store , but is likely to have cost around £ 160			1
@entity5 paired the dress with , what else , nude pumps			1
though while @entity42 favours the @entity44 sledge , @entity5 wore the @entity46 mid-heel court , £ 175			2
the @entity47 became the very first members of the family to meet the @entity50 and @entity50 's new son , almost 23 hours after the infant was born			1
until then the new parents had spent time bonding together with their baby			0
they are both doing really well			0
we are so thrilled , ’ @entity5 told the gathered @entity55 outside the @entity56 after their hour and a quarter - long visit			2
she said the new parents were doing ‘ fabulously ’ - but would n't be drawn over the issue of naming the baby			0
no suggestions from them , them ? ‘ absolutely not ! ’ said @entity5			2
@entity5 and @entity6 arrived a short while after @entity42 's hairdresser , @entity67 , unofficially confirmed that the @entity50 and @entity50 would be departing today by arriving at the back entrance of the @entity69 wheeling along her kit bag			1
the @entity71 paused only for the briefest of moments at the top of the steps at the front entrance of the @entity69 before disappearing inside , no doubt eager to meet the new arrival			1
the boy , who is third in line to the throne , will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , and will succeed his father @entity81 , making him third in the line of @entity83 that will follow on from the @entity85 's lengthy reign			0
@entity42 , @entity81 and the new baby are expected to make their own appearance on the steps of the @entity69 , just like @entity90 and @entity91 did before them , at around 6pm today			1
delighted : the two were all smiles as they arrived at the @entity69 grandmother of the monarch : @entity5 and @entity6 are now linked by bloodline to the throne a member of the royal household arrived at the same time as the hairstylist , carrying an opaque dress bag that looked to be holding at least three garments , thought to be the selection of dresses @entity42 will choose from to make her first appearance as a mother			1
speculation raged over what the @entity50 might wear - but the odds were on her choosing a blue dress by a @entity113 designer			1
as for other visitors , @entity115 watchers initially said we were unlikely to see any of the major @entity115 arrive at the hospital , mainly owing to the increased security it would demand			0
early reports suggested police presence would have to be upped sixfold if the @entity85 were to attend @entity16 's - and the @entity115 would likely deem there had already been enough disruption to the running of the hospital and the areas around it			0
the wait is over ! @entity5 and @entity6 arrived at the hospital by @entity130 taxi but over the past hour , onlookers outside @entity16 's have reported an increase in police presence that could either herald the departure of @entity42 and @entity81 - or the arrival of @entity115 visitors			1
@entity90 and @entity137 are thought to be the most likely to be the next to arrive			1
on royal duties elsewhere , @entity139 said she feels ' ridiculously happy ' about the birth			2
' it is a wonderful event			0
i 'm hoping in the next few days to catch up with them , ' she said			0
' i have sent messages but have n't visited			0
having had babies myself i know you really want to close down the hatches and be with your immediate family for the first few days and weeks			2
' i never expected to feel quite this happy but i 've had a big smile on my face every since the news broke			0
' runs in the family : the @entity6 clan favour a nude pump - and @entity5 is no exception			1
she chose the mid-heel court @entity159 for today 's appearance facing the media : photographers take pictures of the @entity42 's parents @entity5 and @entity6 as they arrive at @entity31 today the stylists assistant arrives carrying a suitcase and a dress hidden beneath a protective sheet it was one of the first clues that the @entity50 and @entity50 would be leaving the hospital with their little prince today : @entity42 's hair stylist arriving at the @entity69			1
accompanied by her assistant - who was carrying a baby car seat and a dress bag - the royal hairstylist , who also does the hair of prince @entity81 and prince @entity178 - arrived at @entity31 in @entity17 shortly before @entity42 's parents @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity67 , 50 , often styles @entity42 's hair at home and has been cutting @entity81 and @entity178 's hair for years			0

the blonde stylist was credited with giving @entity42 heat - proof hair that defied the humid @entity192 weather			0
previously @entity42 was a long - term client of the @entity194 celebrity salon in @entity195			0
a source told the @entity198 's @entity197 last year : ' @entity67 is an expert at what @entity42 loves – full glossy blow dries that hold			0
' mrs @entity67 ’s ex-husband @entity202 also has royal connections			2
his @entity205 salon held the @entity206 from 1980 to 1994 and he worked closely with the @entity85 ’s longest - serving hairdresser , @entity207			0
the @entity208 paid the cost of mrs @entity67 throughout the tour last autumn , believed to be £ 300 a day plus travel costs			0
a spokesman for the @entity50 at the time said : ‘ @entity215 ’s hairdresser on the tour is a private individual paid for privately			2
