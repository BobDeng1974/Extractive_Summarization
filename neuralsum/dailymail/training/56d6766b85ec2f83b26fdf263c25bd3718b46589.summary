@entity0 is once again playing with a smile after what has been a frustrating few years for the @entity4 loanee			1
two years ago the winger 's outstanding displays in south @entity7 led @entity8 to come calling , paying a fee which could reach up to £ 15million			1
@entity10 remained with the @entity4 for the remainder of 2012/13 campaign , playing an integral role in their promotion to the @entity16 via the play - offs			1
@entity0 applauds the travelling @entity4 supporters who witnessed the 3 - 2 win at @entity20 @entity10 runs to celebrate with @entity4 team - mates during the 3 - 2 @entity22 win over @entity20 things then began to go awry , though			1
sir @entity24 's last ever signing barely got a look - in under successor @entity26 , leading the 22 - year - old to end the season on loan at @entity30			1
@entity10 again departed @entity31 temporarily in the summer , returning to his south @entity7 roots to rejoin @entity4 on a season - long loan			1
it offered him a chance to relaunch his career and , after an inconsistent start , he is beginning to regularly show glimpses of the skill which led to the chant ' he 's just too good for you			2
' @entity44 of @entity20 attempts to dispossess @entity4 loanee @entity10 at @entity45 's on saturday ' obviously there was a period where i thought " what 's going on here ? '' ' @entity10 said			1
' as a footballer it is important not to think that way and remain professional			0
' i knew that if i got the chance i needed to take it and not dwell on the past and i am not one to dwell on the past and it was up to me to take it			0
' i have a smile on my face because i am back on the pitch			2
i enjoy playing football , so when i am on the pitch i am happy			0
' it is about having trust in me			0
this gaffer has put trust in me and i am trying to give it back and performing for the team			2
' @entity69 runs alongside the @entity4 away support after netting his second , and @entity4 's third @entity10 is enjoying life under new manager @entity73 , who on saturday oversaw his fourth straight win since replacing @entity75			2
the @entity77 international was impressive in the latest victory , causing havoc as @entity4 progressed to the @entity22 fifth - round with a 3 - 2 win at @entity20			1
' i said to myself that if i got minutes on the pitch , then i would get better and better , ' @entity10 said			0
' to find a manager that has got trust in me and get me on the pitch			0
i am going to lose the ball			0
i will do tricks and lose the ball , but if i get the chance i will either try to score or set up a chance			0
' @entity10 celebrates with fellow loanee @entity91 as @entity4 made it through to the @entity22 fifth - round @entity10 's improvement bodes well for both @entity4 and parent club @entity8			1
the winger looks unlikely to taste relegation for the second successive season given the @entity4 ' recent improvements , while @entity8 manager @entity100 will no doubt be pleased to see he has kick - started his career			1
' i can not keep that in my head all the time because i could have another move , but @entity4 is my home , ' @entity10 said			2
' when i am here i feel more confident			0
i have lived in @entity7 all my life and my family is here			0
