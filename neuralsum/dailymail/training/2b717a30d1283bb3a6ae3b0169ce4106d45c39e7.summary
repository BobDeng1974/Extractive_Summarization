by @entity0 for @entity1 a woman who was so fat she struggled to fit through the door and was given less than four years to live has shed a staggering 22st			1
@entity4 , 46 , tipped the scales at 36st , was left housebound as she struggled to walk - or even stand			1
unable to stand long enough to cook herself a meal , the mother - of - three spent her evenings gorging on takeaways and piling on the pounds			2
@entity4 said : ' i was in such a rut , for years i would pick at food all day and then eat takeaways at night			2
' i did n’t go out the house because i was just so embarrassed that my daughter was my carer			0
' when i got really big , i lived on takeaways primarily as i could n’t get up and stand to cook a meal as i was in constant pain , it was horrendous			0
' a seat belt in a car would n’t fit and when i had pictures taken i noticed i was wider than the doors			0
' with her weight spiralling out of control , @entity4 was diagnosed with pulmonary stenosis , oedema , high blood pressure and arthritis in her arms , spine , neck and legs			1
at her heaviest ( left ) @entity4 was unable to stand long enough to cook a meal and when doctors told her weight was threatening her life she decided to undergo gastric bypass surgery ( right , in hospital ) @entity4 now says her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day unable to even leave her home , doctors told her she would be dead within four years if she did n’t alter her eating habits and significantly reduce her weight			1
but in november 2012 , she had a gastric bypass which helped her to drop an incredible 22st - saving her life			1
she said : ' i had written letters to my family just in case i did n’t make it as there was a real possibility i would n’t			0
' i was obviously very anxious at the time , but the operation was a complete success , i suffered no complications and was home the next day			0
when @entity4 holds up her old clothing , the sheer scale of her weight loss is visible ' the week after my operation , i found out i was going to be a nana for the first time , i was so happy			2
' @entity4 , who is the youngest of five children , says she was spoilt as a child and started to gradually gain weight at age 11			1
by the time she reached adulthood , she started to binge excessively on chocolate , crisps and late night takeaways , ignoring her parents ’ advice to lose weight through exercising and dieting			2
in one desperate bid to lose weight , she even attempted to starve herself , but @entity4 , who had to buy specially made clothes on @entity91 , was unable to keep her weight down			1
as well as the surgery shrinking the size of her stomach , @entity4 has totally changed her diet , swapping takeaways for fresh healthy food and when she met her now fiancé , @entity99 , 49 , her body mass index ( @entity101 ) soared to a massive 89.6 - more than 60 units above the recommended average for an adult			1
but it was only when @entity4 reached her heaviest that she was referred to a weight management specialist who secured her funding for the gastric band operation			1
dr @entity110 of @entity111 carried out the surgery and through a strict diet of mainly fruit and vegetables , @entity4 managed to shed a staggering 22st			1
she said : ' i love being able to buy clothes from normal shops for the first time			0
@entity120 pizza chocolate crisps pies bags of sweets chips @entity128 @entity129 ’s @entity130 cakes biscuits fish chicken tuna beef salad fruit cereal cottage cheese crackers skimmed milk nuts homemade vegetable stews ' i have n’t even thought about eating any chocolate or anything sweet since my bypass			0
' i am determined i was given an opportunity to change my life , so that ’s exactly what i ’m doing			0
' i can now see a future with my children , grandchild and husband to be			0
' following her remarkable weight loss , @entity4 ’s partner @entity99 from @entity156 , proposed in february this year and she said her next challenge is to have the 3st of excess skin removed before her wedding day			2
she still suffers from arthritis and takes medication to keep her blood pressure down , but after years of obesity @entity4 is now able to spend more time with her one - year - old grandchild , @entity4 and said she is determined to grab life with both hands			1
she said : ' the excess skin i ’ve been left with does get me down and does add to the pain i suffer with on a daily basis			0
' some would say it ’s a small price to pay , but it ’s very disheartening when you have worked so hard to lose so much weight			0
' but on the other hand , i would n’t change my decision to have a bypass , it changed my life and i would n’t be here to see my beautiful grandchild without it			0
