by @entity0 published : 02:28 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 18:08 est , 13 april 2012 @entity1 off the beat : new @entity4 chief constable @entity3 , pictured , wants to take warranted officers off the streets plans to replace beat policemen with community support officers were heavily criticised yesterday ... by the man who created the so - called plastic pcs in the first place			1
fully - trained officers would be taken off the streets and put into fast response teams			2
community support officers – also nicknamed ‘ @entity1 ’ after former home secretary @entity17 under whose watch they were established – lack the arrest powers available to warranted officers			1
they are also cheaper and have less training			0
but even mr @entity17 , who is an mp in @entity20 , condemned the plans , saying @entity22 were intended to help police but not replace them			1
he said : ‘ warranted officers will always be required to conduct arrests , develop good scientific forensic investigations and build the kind of community policing which engages those living there			2
’ the proposals are for @entity30 but there are fears the idea could be adopted by other forces			2
the senior officer behind them was forced to deny it would lead to officers sitting in police stations			0
chief constable @entity3 said : ‘ they will still be working in the same areas			1
‘ if somebody needs a police officer , they will get one , in the same way they always have			0
’ ' we ’re determined to use both police officers and @entity22 as efficiently as we possibly can			1
what we want to do is make sure that we send them to the right jobs , ' he said			0
of the remaining 20 per cent , only a small number turn out to be confrontational situations			0
pcsos are asked to deal with a huge range of things already – what we ’re looking at is if there ’s anything else we can do to maximise what we get out of them			0
' in an interview this morning @entity3 said the issue was a ' storm in a tea cup '			2
opposed : former home secretary @entity17 helped bring in @entity22 but says they are not a replacement for beat bobbies he told the @entity81 4 today programme the policy had been in place for some time but ' grabbed the headlines ' based on an update report to the local police authority			1
mr @entity3 said : ' any suggestion we are taking officers away from areas they have been working in the past is plain wrong			1
' we have had @entity22 in the police service for 10 years , we have some fantastic , dedicated and talented people			1
' they are capable of dealing with 95 % of the community type issues which come up			0
but there are also generally things , particularly around more confrontational situations , you would genuinely want a police office for			0
' when those occasions arise people will have a police officer to deal with that			0
' former home secretary @entity17 has raised concerns about the proposals saying it is a mistake , despite being the man who brought in @entity22 , then dubbed ' @entity17 's @entity1 '			1
a spokesman for the @entity110 , which represents rank and file police , said : ‘ what we do n’t want is for officers to only turn up when someone needs arresting or dealing with			0
‘ we do n’t want to be seen to be the bad guys			0
1960s : @entity120 stars @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , and the move by @entity4 police has been described as a return to this style of policing ‘ we ’ve spent years and years with communities building up a relationship with the police			1
’ opposition leader @entity133 said he did not back the proposals			1
speaking in @entity137 upon @entity138 in @entity4 , the @entity136 leader said : ' we need @entity22 but we need them supporting and working with police officers on the frontline			1
i think that 's the kind of neighbourhood policing that people want to see			0
' i do n't think they want police officers out of the way , just in their patrol cars , just dealing with other issues and away from the beat			0
' i think you need on the beat police officers and @entity22			2
' video : @entity133 has reservations about the policing plans			2

@entity30 chief @entity3 wants @entity22 to do all street patrols so officers can focus on serious crime
former home secretary @entity17 opposes the plan , despite bringing in @entity22 himself
the *change* has been *branded* a return to the @entity120 - style policing made *famous* in the 1960s
labour leader @entity133 brands the plan ' not what people want '
