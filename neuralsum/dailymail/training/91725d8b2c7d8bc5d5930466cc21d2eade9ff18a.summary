@entity0 knows that the dividends will come from the weeks he has been spending with the buddy he describes as ‘ @entity3 ’			1
the friend in question is @entity6 , his host and training partner last month in @entity8 , where they worked themselves into a stupor before @entity12 to prepare for a new season which should see them spend more time together			1
that is because @entity0 ’s steadily - climbing ranking should mean he gets into some of the tournaments @entity6 takes for granted , such as the @entity19 , which begins on monday			1
@entity6 's gruelling training regime is paying dividends as he prepares for the @entity19 @entity6 goes into the first grand slam of the year in great shape after putting in the hard graft the 27 - year - old @entity25 , now on the cusp of the world ’s top 100 , further illustrated that he belongs there with a 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 victory over @entity32 no 1 @entity31 in the @entity33			1
true , it was only an exhibition but to defuse the giant ’s serve when he is tuning up for the year ’s first @entity38 is a good effort all the same , and an early payback for the toiling in @entity42			0
‘ @entity6 is a beast , everyone knows that , and he might disagree but i kept up with him , we were pushing each other , ’ said @entity0 , who spent two - and - a - half weeks as @entity6 ’s house guest , before hooking up with him again in the @entity44 after @entity12			1
‘ it was hard but you do n’t have doubts because you know you have done the work with one of the best in the world			0
’ @entity0 outlined the kind of regime they endured in a place where most go for hedonistic pleasure , not brutal training punishment			2
@entity0 joined @entity6 in @entity8 last month to prepare for the new season ‘ every other day we would play for about three - and - a - half hours , like in a @entity38			1
on the other days it would be more like two hours on court and then every day it ’s up to two hours in the gym			1
’ there would also be sessions on the beach , no recliners necessary			0
‘ we did sand work , mainly short repeated sprints when you ’d compete against each other			0
at the end of most days you are dead ... in bed by 10 o’clock			0
‘ i was looked after really well by his team			0
i am a lot stronger and moving better than before			0
’ this is the sort of regime that sees @entity6 turn up every year in @entity84 in prime shape , and his reversion to sand training looks to be a change under his new structure working full - time with trainer @entity90			1
@entity6 has been gearing up for the @entity19 under the watchful eye of coach @entity92 @entity6 ’s future father - in - law , the experienced coach @entity93 , revealed earlier this month that his resting heart beat was a phenomenally low 37 beats per minute			2
the former @entity98 champion has been working on his already lightning foot - speed , spending slightly more time on the court and less in the gym			2
he and @entity0 have become close since becoming a regular duo in the @entity104 team and although they have largely inhabited different tennis worlds @entity6 has taken a close interest in his rise up the rankings			1
‘ @entity6 is always the first to say well done when i ’ve had a decent win , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i was flagging a bit at the end of last season and he helped keep me going			0
’ they have a shared interest in @entity118 , for whom @entity0 , who grew up in @entity114 , dreamed of playing as a child			2
while @entity121 ’s @entity120 has an unusual sports clothing deal with men ’s outfitter @entity125 , @entity6 has a more lucrative tie - in with @entity127			1
‘ the only bad thing about him is that he is sharing his clothing supplier with @entity130 , ’ added @entity0			2
@entity0 has made a steady rise up the rankings and is on the cusp of the world 's top 100 @entity121 youngsters @entity135 and @entity137 moved to within one match of qualifying for the main draw of a @entity38 for the first time when they made the third round of the @entity19 qualifying event			2
@entity135 , the 20 - year - old from @entity145 , came back to beat @entity32 left - hander @entity146 4 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 and now faces a winnable clash with world no 323 @entity149 of @entity84			0
@entity137 fought out a fine 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 win over another @entity32 , 18 - year - old @entity151 , a superb ball - striker reckoned to be one of the sport ’s hottest prospects			0
it was a match of supremely high quality for the qualifying event on the most remote outside court , and his reward is to meet @entity32 veteran @entity161			0
@entity163 ’s encouraging form continued when she made her second semi-final on the main @entity165 by defeating @entity167 ’s @entity166 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 in the @entity168 .			0

@entity0 joined @entity6 in @entity8 to prepare for new season
@entity172 spent a gruelling three - and - half hours on court every other day
@entity104 pals spent two hours flat out in the gym every day
both men were put through punishing beach sprints to get in shape
