@entity0 said @entity1 announced ' to me and to the crowd that he would ' kill ' me if i ever came to his house with my camera for an interview			1
' i 'll kill you , ' he declared			0
' at the time @entity1 was being honored for his film @entity23			2
he made the comments after referring to @entity0 's on - camera confrontation with then - @entity27 president @entity26 in his documentary @entity28			1
speaking from the stage , @entity30 : ' @entity0 and i actually have a lot in common			2
' we both appreciate living in a country where there 's free expression			0
but , @entity0 , if you ever show up at my front door with a camera , i 'll kill you			2
' @entity0 said he laughed nervously along with the rest of the audience			2
he assumed , @entity1 was joking			0
he wrote : having just experienced a half - dozen assaults in the previous year from crazies upset at ' @entity45 ' and my anti-war @entity47 speech , plus the attempt by a right wing extremist to blow up my house ( he was caught in time and went to prison ) , i was a bit stunned to hear @entity1 , out of the blue , make such a violent statement			1
but i instantly decided he was just trying to be funny , so i laughed the same nervous laugh everyone else did			0
@entity1 , though , did n't seem to like all that laughter			0
' i mean it , ' he barked , and the audience grew more quiet			0
' i 'll shoot you			0
' @entity0 said there was a ' smattering of approving applause ' , but most people simply turned around to check his reaction			0
i then mumbled to those sitting at my table			0
' i think @entity85 just said , " make my day , punk			0
'' ' @entity0 sparked a flurry of debate after he spoke out on @entity89 following the release of @entity1 's box - office record beating @entity8 , calling snipers ' cowards '			1
@entity94 was one of many high - profile people to defend the film calling out @entity0 for his ' disrespect ' of @entity99 troops			0
while attending the @entity101 last week , the former vice presidential candidate posed with @entity103 recipient @entity102 , who held up a sign reading ' f * * * you @entity0 '			1
in his @entity13 page , @entity0 goes on to say that @entity1 is a ' great filmmaker ' and that his movie ' @entity110 ' is his favorite @entity111 of all time , before then proceeding to attack him further			1
he writes : ' but something started to go haywire with @entity1 in the last decade			0
' he cites @entity1 casting himself in ' @entity114 ' and his staging of a conversation with an invisible @entity117 two years later at a @entity118			2

@entity0 said in the coming days he will share ' some thoughtful pieces ' on @entity8 , by others , as well as ' my real thoughts ' on it			1
