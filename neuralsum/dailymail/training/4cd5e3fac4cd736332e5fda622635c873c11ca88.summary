' @entity2 made the announcement overnight via a guest column in the @entity32 newspaper			2
the outgoing congressman said he has already asked @entity35 gov. @entity34 to call a special election for his district that coincides with the nov. 4 general election			0
that would enable his successor to take office immediately			0
that person is likely to be college professor @entity43 , the @entity45 - backed political novice who @entity2 lost the @entity3 primary to in june			1
the non-partisan @entity48 rates @entity2 's seat as a solid @entity3 congressional district , and brat is expected to win the general election by as many as 10 points			0
in his guest column @entity2 indicated that he had not yet made a decision about how he intends to use his new - found free time			2

' @entity2 , centre , had previously said he would serve his full term , which would have ended in january but now says he will step down to make sure constituents have a voice during the ' consequential ' lame - duck session before his defeat , @entity2 had been seen as a potential rival — and likely successor — to house speaker @entity83			1
though he had a conservative voting record , @entity2 was distrusted by some @entity45 supporters who suspected he might be too eager to reach a compromise on immigration legislation			0
on his final day as no. 2 @entity89 leader , @entity2 gave a 10 minute speech thanking his colleagues and sharing his vision for @entity67			2
at the time , the remarks came off as more of a long goodbye than a changing of the guard , but with several months left before the end of the current legislative session , spectators assumed @entity2 was giving a @entity101 as the @entity3 majority leader			1
during his remarks @entity2 mentioned problems in the @entity104 and tensions with @entity106 and @entity107 and said the @entity67 must ' make leadership abroad a priority			0
