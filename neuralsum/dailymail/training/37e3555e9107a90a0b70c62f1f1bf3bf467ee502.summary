' @entity129 told i was borderline diabetic was n't nice			0
i 'd tried so many diets over the years but nothing really worked			0
this was the shock i needed to act			0
' i started using the band and doing @entity46			1
every time i ate i would feel it pinch , and i 'd stop eating			1
' so as well as me having set meals to follow , as soon as my stomach was starting to expand , the band would kick in and stop me			0

now , i go shopping with them and chat about fashion			0
' i wear trendy dresses and look forward to getting dressed up for a night out			0

lost the weight using a slimming aid favoured by @entity92
@entity39 string sits round the waist to remind you not to eat too much
it will feel tight and pinch if you eat past feeling full
you shorten the string as you slim , ensuring the weight keeps dropping
