palmistry is the ancient art of predicting the future through the reading of palm lines			1
the art is hugely popular in @entity6 where palm readers charge optimistic customers upwards of £ 50 a session to tell them what the future could hold , simply by looking at the markings on their hands			1
but and now for those not content with the fortune lines that nature gave them there is a drastic new way of trying to be master of their own destiny : by altering their palm lines through cosmetic surgery			1
the surgery , which has also been known to be carried out in @entity27 , is performed with an electric scalpel which burns the flesh leaving a semi-permanent scar			1
the people of @entity6 , where palmistry is huge , are having their palm lines improved by cosmetic surgery to enhance their fate a report on @entity37 found that between january 2011 and may this year , 37 palm plastic surgeries have been performed at one clinic in @entity6			1
@entity40 offers the surgery for £ 662 but no longer advertises the treatment because they could n't keep up with demand			1
dr @entity44 , who has performed 20 of the operations , told @entity37 : ' if you try to create a palm line with a laser , it heals , and it wo n’t leave a clear mark			0
' you have to use the electric scalpel and make a shaky incision on purpose , because palm lines are never completely straight			2
' if you do n’t burn the skin and just use a plain scalpel , the lines do n’t form			2
it ’s not a difficult surgery , but it has to be done right			2
' the procedure usually takes 10 to 15 minutes and can include between 5 to 10 lines being on the palm being altered			1
one clinic in @entity6 offers the surgery for £ 662 and it takes around 15 minutes to complete			1
men want their financial lines lengthening and women opt for enhancement to their marriage line some patients use a marker pen to show the surgeon which lines they want extending prior to surgery			1
it takes around a month for the wounds to heal and for the new palm lines to form			0
most of the patients are thirty - something men and women who have a predilection for fortune - telling			1
whilst men want their money line or success line extending , women want their love / marriage line lengthening			1
some women do n't even have a marriage line and believe that because of this , they wo n't find love			1
others do have a marriage line but seek another one because they believe their first one appeared too early and they missed their chance			0
but does it work ? dr @entity44 gave one woman a wedding line and soon after she wrote to him saying she had married			0
two other patients won the lottery after he extended their fortune lines			2
despite these success stories , @entity44 is n't , however , sure how effective the surgery really is and believes there may be a placebo effect			0
' if people think they ’ll be lucky , sometimes they become lucky			0
and it ’s not like the palm lines are really written in stone — they ’re basically wrinkles , ' he adds			0
he explains that lines do change with time and even the way people use their hands can change them			2
some palmisters reportedly suggest that their clients who do n't want to undergo the surgery can draw the lines on their hands themselves to change their fortune			1
' the placebo effect could positively change somebody 's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary surgical intervention			0
try a lucky charm maybe ... ’ @entity130 , a @entity132 - based palm reader , says the surgery is futile			0
' i read about this surgery and i was very surprised			0
' even by having surgery , the lines can not be changed			2
' if you want to improve your fortune , take physical actions			0
so if you want greater health , do some exercise			0
' i have seen people 's health lines change after six months of yoga			1
' dr. @entity146 , founder , director and head of practice and surgical at 111 @entity150 in @entity132 , added : ‘ it is possible to have complications from this type of surgery such as infection and painful neuromas which can create a source of irritation			0
' the placebo effect could positively change somebody 's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary surgical intervention			0
' try a lucky charm maybe			0
’ a high @entity165 shows someone who can be promiscuous and overindulgent a flat @entity165 shows you have little or no interest in family life and tend to criticise others palmists look at qualities of the hand , such as shapes and lines of the palm and fingers , colour and texture of the skin and fingernails , as well as the sizes of the palm and fingers and knuckles			2

new plastic surgery trend in @entity6 and @entity27
patients want to extend their lines to change their future
one clinic has stopped advertising the procedure as demand was too high
men want longer financial lines , women want longer marriage lines
