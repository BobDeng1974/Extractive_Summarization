but one plucky surfer who lost a finger while fighting off a shark off of @entity7 in @entity8 decided to keep one of its teeth as a memento			1
the 29 - year - old man , who has not been named , managed to raise a smile while being treated by paramedics , despite suffering serious injuries , including another partially severed finger , a crushed knuckle and a deep gash in his leg			1
‘ he tried to push it off with his left hand and his hand has gone into its mouth , ’ said senior police constable @entity32 after the surfer had been taken to hospital in @entity7 , north of @entity35			2
‘ he ’s lost the index finger past the knuckle , and another finger was just hanging by shreds i do n’t know if it can be re-attached			0
’ constable @entity32 said the man ’s thigh had suffered a ‘ slash bite ’ rather than losing any flesh and paramedics were confident the wound could be easily stitched up			1
the man was able to paddle in by himself on his board with a friend at his side , when they were able to raise the alarm			0
he was later flown to hospital in @entity55 , 100 miles north of @entity35			0
the experienced surfer told police and paramedics that he was reasonably sure he had been attacked by a bull shark measuring about 8ft long			2
danger : the surfer believes he was attacked by a bull shark ( like the one pictured ) but the exact species has yet to be confirmed ‘ he ’s been able to keep a tooth from the attack and give it to the right people , ’ said constable @entity32			1
‘ i do n’t know where he found it – maybe in his board , which was damaged – and put in in his pocket when he got to the beach			0
’ experts from the @entity74 will examine the tooth to confirm the species of shark involved in the attack			1
the surfer had been staying at a camping site with his wife , who flew with him to hospital			0
@entity81 , at @entity82 , south of @entity7 , where the attack occurred , is popular with surfers due to its exposed location and protection from north - easterly winds			0
beaches in the area have been closed as a precaution			0
local people said it was extremely rare for a shark attack to occur in the area			1
there have been 50 fatalities from shark encounters in @entity99 waters in the past 50 years , 30 per cent of attacks proving fatal			2
in recent years , most attacks have occurred off the coast of @entity103 .			0
