@entity1 boss @entity0 felt bad memories of last season 's 5 - 1 thrashing at the hands of @entity6 might have affected some of his players during sunday 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity10			1
@entity12 ' side were dominant in the opening half but both sides went into the break level at 1 - 1 , a stark contrast to the last time the two sides met in february - when @entity6 were already leading 4 - 0			1
this time around @entity18 looked to have given @entity1 a welcome three points with his second - half goal , but @entity22 's injury - time equaliser earned the hosts a share of the spoils - leaving the @entity26 four points off fourth - placed @entity28 as a result			1
he said : ' we had problems to get our flow going			0
' we did not have enough possession in the game			0
in the first half it was down to tactical and some psychological reasons : maybe bad memories from last year			2
some players were not at their best			0
' i felt we played with the handbrake too much , in the first half especially , in the second half we played much better but at 2 - 1 we sat back too much			1
@entity26 right - back @entity60 celebrates scoring @entity1 's equaliser on the stroke of half - time @entity65 international @entity64 is congratulated by his team - mates after giving @entity6 the lead @entity6 boss @entity12 and @entity1 manager @entity0 watch on from the touchline on sunday ' when you do n't score goal number three you are under threat to concede a second			1
' @entity0 , too , was unhappy with his side 's defending throughout the game			2
he added : ' overall i think once they were down to 10 men they were not dangerous any more			0
' to concede the corner that was a bit unlucky but then we did n't jump with @entity22			0
' overall it is a fair result but a frustrating result for us because they came back when we had plenty of defenders on the pitch and could have defended the set - piece much better			0

@entity1 conceded a last - gasp goal to be *denied* a win at @entity6
@entity22 struck at the death to earn the hosts a point
@entity0 believes some of his players might have had ' bad memories ' of last season 's thrashing at @entity10 during the 2 - 2 draw
@entity6 beat @entity1 5 - 1 in last 's season league *clash* in february
