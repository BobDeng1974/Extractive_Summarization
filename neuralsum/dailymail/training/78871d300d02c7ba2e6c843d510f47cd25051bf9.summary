by @entity0 accessing the @entity1 , where drugs and weapons can be purchased at the click of a button , just got easier with the launch of a search engine based on @entity8			0
@entity9 , which was launched last week , appears to have modeled itself closely on @entity8 , from the brightly colored logo to the ' @entity14 ' search button			1
unlike the mainstream search engine however , those wanting to use @entity9 have to access the tor browser that provides an extra level of anonymity			1
web search : grams may look like @entity8 but it helps users find drugs and guns the site works by searching multiple illicit websites such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , which are known for providing access to stolen credit cards , fake ids and drugs			0
previously , accessing those sites would have meant knowing the exact url to type in			2
' i noticed on the forums and reddit people were constantly asking " where to get product x ? " and " which market had product x ? " or " who had the best product x and was reliable and not a scam ? " , ' the creator , who asked to remain anonymous , told @entity47			0
' i wanted to make it easy for people to find things they wanted on the " darknet " and figure out who was a trustworthy vendor			0

the site will also help users track down sites that have been closed by agencies such as the @entity57 , which closed @entity55 - where illegal drugs could allegedly be traded - last year			2
other functions of @entity9 mirror @entity8 , such as space to leave reviews , and the development of an advertising tool to allow sellers to pay for a more prominent listing .			1

@entity9 searches several underground sites to provide *detailed* results
*buyers* and sellers can also leave reviews on purchases
