by @entity0 from the dress to the flowers to the cake , it ’s the second-most important event of a woman ’s life			1
you ’ve had your @entity9 , now it ’s your daughter ’s time to shine			1
but being the mother - of - the - bride is fraught with danger			1
while you want to look your best , you do n’t want to overshadow your darling girl			2
i may be 54 , but i take care of my appearance and i feel — and look — better than i did in my 20s			2
but my daughter @entity19 , 26 , is getting married soon , to her lovely fiance @entity20 , 27 , in a historic church in @entity22 , and i certainly do n’t want to steal the spotlight			1
so how to choose the perfect outfit ? i asked bridal experts to compile five of the best mother - of - the - bride outfits the @entity27 has to offer			1
did i find ‘ @entity28 ’ ? read on to find out			2
@entity30 lace dress , £ 295 , and shoes , £ 160 , @entity32 , £ 30 , coast.com the expert view ‘ the length of hem can make or break your outfit , ’ says wedding wear designer @entity34			1
‘ too long and it looks dowdy ; too short and it looks as if you think you ’re 21			2
‘ the mother - of - the - bride needs to be able to bend down to smooth your daughter ’s train , reach up to fix her veil , and sit down and stand up in church without your hem rising			1
go for one inch above the knee if you have great legs ; one inch below if you do n’t			2
’ @entity52 's verdict i love the way this look is modest , but not mumsy			1
the pretty lace overlay means i can show a little bit of decolletage without having any cleavage on display			2
the nude colour is slimming , and it fits well , skimming over my hips			0
i ’m not so keen on the hat , which looks like a piece of fishing kit			0
i thought black was out of the question for weddings , but used sparingly in details such as the lace , shoes and hat , it sharpens up the outfit			0
score : 4/5 floral dress , £ 129 , jigsaw - online.com , @entity30 jacket , £ 129 , jacques - vert.co.uk , @entity30 hat , from £ 220 , fenwick.co.uk shoes , £ 170 , lkbennett.com the expert view ‘ every mother - of - the - bride wants to cover her arms , ’ says @entity34			1
‘ you do n’t need to have full sleeves — you can go for a lace overlay or wear a cropped jacket or bolero you can take off later for dancing			0
’ @entity52 's verdict this outfit ticks all the boxes for me			1
@entity95 dresses can look chintzy , but this watercolour floral print is on trend and you could pick out any shade , from pink or purple to teal or blue , for your jacket and hat			0
it ’s fitted but not restrictive , a great length and the neckline does n’t show too much cleavage			0
the bracelet sleeves are comfortable			0
i ’m a big fan of this hat — it ’s like a fascinator , making a statement without swamping your head			0
score : 5/5 goat dress , £ 450 , fenwick.co.uk hat , £ 280 , ginafoster.co.uk shoes , £ 39.99 , zara.com clutch , £ 165 russellandbromley.com the expert view ‘ a plain outfit can be worn with an elaborate hat , while an embellished dress works with simple headwear , ’ says milliner @entity119			0
‘ full hats and larger headpieces are popular this season , but choose a style that wo n’t cast a shadow over your face in photographs			0
’ @entity52 's verdict this saucer - shaped creation is a showstopper but it is n’t too big and it ’s incredibly light , so there ’s no danger of ‘ hat hair ’			1
the pastel crepe dress wo n’t crease when you sit down and the darts are slimming			0
score : 5/5 @entity144 dress , £ 149 , @entity145 @entity147 coat , £ 439 , and @entity149 hat , £ 99 , @entity150 fenwick.co.uk shoes , £ 88 , boden.co.uk the expert view ‘ the bride ’s mother chooses the colour of her outfit first , getting her cue from her daughter , ’ says @entity34			1
‘ the mother of the groom should then go for a complementary hue from a different colour group			1
so , if the bride ’s mother chooses lilac , the groom ’s mother should go for metallics			1
as to how pale you can go , if your daughter ’s happy for you to wear cream , try it with gold , which reflects light on to the face			1
’ @entity52 's verdict truly lovely			1
the long jacket will look smart , but i can take it off for dancing			0
it ’s a flattering length , and not too restrictive , while the metallic spots give it the wow factor			0
i love the gold shoes , which take the outfit up a notch			0
the hat is light and unobtrusive , and the weave matches that of the dress and coat			0
score : 4/5 blue coat , £ 99 , marksandspencer.com hat , £ 35 , coast.com trousers , £ 95 , reiss.com clutch , £ 25 , dorothyperkins.com shoes , £ 185 , lucychoi.com the expert view ‘ if you ’re not comfortable showing your legs , trousers can be very chic — just be careful not to look underdressed , ’ says @entity34			0
‘ a super-smart coat can be the answer , made from silk with a little natural shimmer , or a detailed design			0
if you ’re pear - shaped , it ’ll draw the eyes to tour top half and skim over your hips			2
’ @entity52 's verdict i would never have considered trousers as i ’d have assumed they ’d be too casual			2
but while these are fairly simple , the coat transforms them into something special , and i particularly like the combination of white with eau de nil			0
the hat is by top milliner @entity220 , so you get designer style at a @entity27 price			1
