by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 19:08 est , 28 january 2014 the number patients aged over 90 having to be taken to @entity3 by ambulance has soared by 80 per cent in just three years			1
some 300,370 were brought in to hospital accident and emergency units last year , up from 165,910 in 2009/10			0
mps and campaigners say cuts to social care budgets and failures by @entity13 services mean the elderly are not being properly looked after at home			1
surge : the number elderly patients rushed to @entity3 has surged since 2009 a lack of home help and inadequate monitoring by doctors , practice nurses and – in some cases – families has left them prone to falls , fractures , infections and sudden problems with long - term complaints such as heart failure			1
figures from the @entity33 show that overall , 21.7million people attended @entity3 last year , up from 21.5million in 2011/12			1
but the increase was starkest among the over- 90s brought in by ambulance , up from 275,883 in 2011/12 to 300,370 last year			2
there is concern that many are having to wait in ambulances outside @entity3 because hospital staff are too busy to attend to them immediately			1
shadow health secretary @entity43 said : ‘ the government ’s severe cuts to social care have left thousands of older people without the support they need , at risk of going into hospital and getting trapped there			2
’ however , health secretary @entity53 has pledged to bring back the traditional role of family doctor overseeing the care of elderly patients round the clock to stop them ending up in @entity3			1
concern : age @entity59 warned that increases in hospital visits can be a result of poor car at home in an article for the @entity67 in november , he promised to give the over- 75s a named gp familiar with their conditions			2
he said yesterday : ‘ @entity70 ’s disastrous 2004 gp contract left many vulnerable elderly patients without good out - of - hours care , so it ’s rank hypocrisy for them now to complain about the consequences of their historic mistake			1
we have ripped up that contract and are bringing back proper family doctoring			0
’ @entity81 , charity director at @entity59 , said : ‘ in some cases being admitted to hospital is the consequence of not getting good - quality care at home			0
' the core of the problem is that funding for social care has failed and is still failing to keep up with growing demand			0
‘ the care of our most vulnerable must be a priority			0
” consultants had feared this winter would be one of the worst on record for @entity3 units facing a shortage of doctors and a steady rise in patients			1
promise : health secretary @entity53 has pledged to bring back ' proper family doctoring ' but most departments have been far less busy than anticipated , partly due to mild weather and low levels of flu and the norovirus stomach bug			2
however , dr @entity110 , president of the @entity111 , warned that ‘ the system remains fragile ’			0
he said : ‘ that is why we are working with @entity115 and the government to deliver			0
efficient long - term solutions			0
’ the figures also show patients aged 20 to 24 are more likely to go to @entity3 than other groups – which campaigners say is because they are pushier and expect to be treated immediately			1
they comprise 8.6 per cent of all attendances , compared with the 50 to 54 age group , for example , who make up 5 per cent , and the 70 to 74 group at 3.5 per cent			0
@entity127 , of @entity128 , said : ‘ this is the demanding generation who want a cure now			0
‘ they may also be far more familiar with @entity3 units than they are with @entity13 out - of - hours services or walk - in centres			1
’ he added : ‘ if only the elderly were more pushy			2

mps and campaigners blame budget cuts and failures by gp services
they say lack of help makes elderly prone to falls and infections
concerns ambulances are being forced to wait because @entity3 is so busy
@entity33 figures show *drastic* increase
