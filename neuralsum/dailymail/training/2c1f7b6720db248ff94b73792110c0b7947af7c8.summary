a @entity1 volcano has created a substantial new island since it began erupting last month and spewing out huge volumes of rock and dense ash			2
the volcano , about 65 kilometres north west of the @entity10 nation 's capital @entity11 , rumbled to life on december 20 for the first time in five years , the @entity6 said			1
it said the volcano was erupting from two vents , one on the uninhabited island of @entity18 and the other underwater about 100 metres offshore			1
' the new island is more than one kilometre wide , two kilometres long and about 100 metres high , ' it said in a statement			1
' during our observations the volcano was erupting about every five minutes to a height of about 400 metres , accompanied by some large rocks ... as the ash is very wet , most is being deposited close to the vent , building up the new island			1
' it said ash and acidic rain was deluging an area 10 kilometres around the volcano and killing of nearby vegetation , adding : ' leaves on trees on @entity18 and @entity18 have died , probably caused by volcanic ash and gases			1
' the new island is more than one kilometre wide , two kilometres long and about 100 metres high @entity49 ( marked ) sits beneath the ocean 65km northwest of @entity18 's capital @entity11			1
the volcano gets its name from the two islands it is situated between - @entity18 and @entity18 a number of international flights were cancelled earlier this week amid concerns about the volcano 's ash plume , which reached heights of more than 4,500 metres			1
however they resumed on wednesday , with authorities saying debris from the eruption was not being thrown high into the atmosphere			2
the underwater volcano was also responsible for causing a so - called red tide. , also known as an algal bloom , in which the surrounding ocean turned the colour of blood			0
an algal bloom occurs when there is a sudden increase in the amount of algae in water			0
it is said to be part of the volcanic @entity81 and was one of a 36 undersea volcanoes locally when levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise , which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of @entity18 , algae can multiply			2
typically , this causes water to turn green , but the effect also causes reds and yellows to be released			0
in particular , a bloom of dinoflagellate algae causes water to turn blood red in colour			0
@entity18 , which is almost 2,000 kilometres northeast of @entity100 , lies on the @entity10 ' @entity81 ' , where continental plates collide causing frequent volcanic and seismic activity			2
these natural - colour images from 29 december and 31 december show the waters around @entity18 , @entity18 , and @entity18			0
they were taken by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) on @entity110 's @entity109 satellite			0
dense cloud cover prevented other remote observations for several days when levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise in water , which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of @entity18 , algae can multiply			0
typically , this causes water to turn green , but the effect also causes reds ( pictured in @entity124 ) and yellows to be released			0

the new island is more than one kilometre wide , two kilometres long and about 100 metres high
it was created by the volcano @entity49 , which lies 65km north of @entity18 's capital
its ash originally reached heights of over 4,500 metres , but is now only reaching 400 metres
' as the ash is very wet , most is being deposited close to the vent , building up the new island , ' the @entity6 and @entity137 said
@entity142 and acidic rain from the eruption are deluging an area 10 kilometres around the volcano and killing of nearby vegetation
