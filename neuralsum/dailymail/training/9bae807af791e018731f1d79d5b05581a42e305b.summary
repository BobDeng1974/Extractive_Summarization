by @entity0 published : 22:05 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 09:29 est , 31 january 2014 a @entity3 town is covered in 8 to 9 - foot piles of tumbleweed thanks to days of high desert winds blowing in the roaming bushes			1
homeowners in @entity9 say the tumbleweeds just started flowing in on sunday like ' herds of cow ' and have since buried homes and even trapped residents in their houses			1
even longtime @entity9 residents say they 've never seen anything like it			1
' we 've lived here 23 years and never seen this			2
so it 's pretty crazy			0
@entity26 and his mother were among the dumbfounded residents of @entity9 who woke up monday morning to the mountains of @entity35 , or @entity37 thistle			1
the noxious invader that arrived from the @entity39 in the 1800 's is now common weed throughout the @entity41			0
too common if you ask @entity43 of @entity9			1
trapped : some people became trapped inside their homes and had to call 911 tumbleweeds aka @entity37 @entity48 iberica is native not to the barren @entity41 , but to the frigid steppe of central @entity50			2
the tumbleweeds hitched a ride with settlers , likely landing somewhere in the @entity54 prior to the 1880s			2
the tenacious plant , which saps water from already parched lands and has few if any uses , quickly became ubiquitous in the central western states			0
the largest specimens can grow as large as a @entity62			0
each winter when the plants dry up and die , the break off their stems and roll away with the winds to spread their nefarious seeds , hundreds of thousands of them , for miles around			1
' it looked like a herd of cows coming , ' she said of the invasion			0
' the tumbleweeds were just rolling in			0
' ' we tried to get out of the house and front and back door was both covered with tumbleweeds and we could n't get out , ' @entity75 said			0
unsure what to do , he called 911			0
' the lady asked what was the emergency and i told her we were covered with tumbleweeds , ' he said			0
though it sounds funny , the tumbleweeds are no laughing matter			0
city crews from @entity9 quickly began the herculean task of removing the thousands of tumbleweeds that just keep doing what they do best and rolling away			1
and with each recurring bout with high desert winds , @entity9 was dealt another prickly , dead brown blow from their tumbling invaders			1
the city of @entity9 told @entity101 that workers would be around town with dump trucks and excavators through the end of the week trying to clean up the unprecedented mess			2
but that 's just on public property			0
the city ca n't go into years to help rid residents of tumbleweeds			2
and that has many folks in @entity9 fearing the nuisance nettles might be around for quite some time			1
the cleanup began shortly after the invasion but renewed desert winds kept sending more weeds flying into town herculean : the city sent out men , trucks , and heavy machinery , but the task before them was daunting private problem : crews did what they could to remove the weeds from public land , but there was nothing they could do for homes inundated with the prickly plant			1

@entity9 , @entity3 has found itself inundated with 8 - foot piles of the *windblown* desert plants since sunday
the tumbleweeds blew in with *extremely* high winds and just kept coming for days
many long - time residents say they 've never seen anything like it
