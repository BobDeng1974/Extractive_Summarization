@entity1 pilots have been banned from flying the new @entity3 fighter jets in a storm over fears the £ 100million plane could explode if struck by lightning			1
the @entity8 or @entity9 said that the stealth @entity3 , which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks , could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm			1
named ‘ @entity3 ’ , it was even at risk of its namesake while on the ground with pilots told to move it under cover if less than 11 miles away from a storm			1
@entity1 pilots have been banned from flying @entity3 fighter jets in a storm over fears it could explode the fighter was created under the @entity29 20 - year @entity28 programme , with the @entity29 government having ordered 2,500 of the @entity32 planes			1
in @entity34 , 14 of the aircraft have been ordered to replace the ageing harrier jump jet on the decks of the new queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers			1
but a recent @entity39 report highlighted concerns over the placement of the jet 's fuel tanks , which are located all the way through the wing , through the fuselage , around the inlets and back toward the engine			0
@entity49 , a former @entity39 analyst who helped design the @entity50 in the early 1970s , compared the engine to ' a blowtorch surrounded by fuel			0
' there was also a risk of catching fire if the fighter plane was shot at			0
last june , an @entity3 burst into flames as it was taxiing for take - off at @entity60 in @entity61 , because the engine had cracked during previous flights manoeuvres			2
one of the @entity65 engines broke apart , pushed through the top of the aeroplane , and caught fire while the pilot was preparing to take off			0
the entire fleet of f - 35s was grounded for three weeks , and the plane missed its international debut			0
but that was not the end of problems for the fighter jets			1
the single - seat , single - engine fighter aircraft boasts a helmet mounted display system which is supposed to offer a 360 degree view of the outside of the aircraft			2
but the @entity85 admitted there were still ' unresolved issues ' surrounding the technology			2
the @entity8 or @entity9 said that the stealth @entity3 , which has been plagued by design flaws and technical setbacks , could not be flown within 28 miles of a thunderstorm in case it was hit by lightning @entity95 defence spokesman @entity94 , who brought up the safety issue in a series of parliamentary questions , told the @entity99 the @entity85 were ' burying its head in the sand ' over the jet 's failures			1
he said : ' when they named the aircraft lightning i do n't think they expected that very thing would render them totally useless			0
adding to this ­ embarrassment is the revelation none of these new jets have yet broken the sound barrier			0
' the @entity1 website states that the @entity3 was built to be a ' multi-role , all weather , day and night aircraft '			1
planes have a top speed of 1,300mph , a range of 1,450 miles and can carry a range of weapons including air - to - air rockets and satellite guided bombs			0
the design also uses stealth technology which will allow pilots to minimise its radar signature .			2
