embarrassed about his country 's inability to complete the promised infrastructure ahead of next month 's @entity5 , @entity1 great @entity0 believes the hosts will get it right on the pitch and win the tournament for a record sixth time			1
@entity1 will stage the @entity5 in june and july for the first time since 1950 and are favourites to lift the trophy at the @entity14 on july 13			1
chaos : @entity0 said he was embarrassed by stadium delays and transport problems in @entity1 concern : building work is still going on at the @entity21 stadium in @entity22 tragedy : an accident at @entity26 's stadium left two workers dead in november taking action : @entity1 's civilian police have recently gone on strike over pay the hosts have struggled to build stadiums on time and many of the promised infrastructure projects such as airports , bus lanes , and metro lines have been either cancelled or scaled down			1
@entity0 , who as a member of the @entity41 is one of the most visible backers of soccer 's world governing body @entity43 and the @entity47 government , said @entity1 has always faced problems of ' corruption , embezzlement , overcharging ' and he lamented the late delivery of stadiums , three of which are still not ready			1
' in 2007 when they decided that the @entity5 would be in @entity1 , president @entity54 signed everything and agreed to everything and then they get here and there 's this bureaucracy , total confusion and lateness , ' @entity0 said			1
' it 's a shame			2
i am embarrassed , this is my country and i love it and we should n't be transmitting this image abroad , ' he added			2
' but we must n't forget that @entity1 was n't perfect before the @entity5			1
it was the same or worse			0
' the former @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 striker is betting on @entity1 to win the competition , with @entity74 his second favourites , followed closely by @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity1 are on a rich run of form and have won 13 of their last 14 encounters , including the five games that won them the @entity84 last year			1
however , no side has ever won the @entity5 a year after lifting the @entity84 trophy and there is also the little matter of pressure			0
local fans are desperate for a home win and yet only six players in @entity94 's 23 - man squad have been to a @entity5 before			0
horrific : evidence of the damage at the stadium , where two workers died following the collapse high hopes : @entity1 legend @entity0 believes the hosts can triumph in the @entity5 shambles ! the @entity103 in @entity26 wo n't be completed before the @entity5 starts ( picture taken in march ) @entity0 , 37 , said the players were experienced enough for the big occasion and will be well prepared by @entity94 - the man who led @entity1 to their last title triumph in 2002 , with the help of two goals from @entity0 in the final			1
the first match against @entity114 on june 12 could set the tone for the tournament , he said			0
' the first game in the @entity5 , in @entity1 , the first match for many players , it is going to be very important and it could determine the team 's future , ' he said			1
' we see players that are 20 years old who 've played with big clubs or with the national team for a year or two so i do n't think the lack of experience will determine the final result			0
' it could be important at some moments of the match but i do n't think it will determine the result			0
' @entity0 also dismissed concerns that @entity138 teams will cope better with the tropical climes and noted that while humidity could be high in coastal and jungle cities , temperatures in some venues could drop to almost freezing in the southern hemisphere 's winter			2
stubborn : @entity1 's civilian police want an 80 per cent pay rise ahead of the @entity5 major blow : the stadium 's roof will now only be completed after the @entity5 has ended ( picture taken may 8 ) fever pitch : a mural of @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity0 and @entity157 in @entity1 ' in @entity159 they play in higher temperatures than here , ' @entity0 said			1
' the games that could be controversial , for example 1 pm kick offs in @entity165 , have been moved			0
' i was in @entity165 in the summer and at game time it could get to 35 degrees ; in the winter it 's 28 , 29			2
that 's a nice temperature to play in			0
' in @entity1 it 's another controversy that makes no sense			2
no one is worried about the cold in @entity22			0
why does no one speak about that ? " ' if i could have manipulated the draw , i 'd have sent the @entity179 to the north and the @entity181 to the south , ' he said with a laugh			0
@entity0 went to four @entity184 and took home winners medals in 1994 and 2002			2
while he holds the record for most goals scored in @entity184 , @entity187 @entity186 could surpass him if he gets two goals this year			0
@entity0 joked he would spend only a little time willing @entity186 to fall short of his 15 - goal tally , then acknowledged that if the big @entity193 forward does equal or break his record then he will deserve all the plaudits that come his way			1
' if he scores more goals than me then all credit to him , ' @entity0 said			2
' so i am not going to be cheering against him			0
the record itself , it was made to be broken , someone will break it , i am under no illusions that it will remain forever			0

the hosts have struggled to build stadiums on time and proposed airports , bus lanes , and metro lines have been either cancelled or scaled down
