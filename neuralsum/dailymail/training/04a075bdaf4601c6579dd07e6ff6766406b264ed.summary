if @entity1 were to continue in their current vein of form for the remainder of the season , they might only just avoid relegation			1
@entity8 ' side have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the 2014 - 15 @entity11 , which puts them on course to earn 44 points			0
that kind of tally would have put them just 11 points outside the drop zone last season , and eight outside it the year before			0
@entity23 and @entity1 have averaged just 1.16 points per game in the current @entity11 season @entity8 ' @entity1 side have lost their last four games in all competitions however , given that 40 points is seen as the ' magic ' marker for team down the bottom , it could be more uncomfortable for @entity8 ' men if they do n't buck up their @entity36 if @entity1 are hoping to make the top four again this campaign , they need to win roughly 2.5 points per game for the rest of the season - a feat they did n't even manage last year when they had the free - scoring @entity43			2
similarly , @entity44 could be set for their first mid-table finish since 1995 if performances do n't improve			1
the @entity48 ' current points per game rate is 1.41 , which would give them a total of 53.5			0
that figure would have earned them ninth place last season			0
if @entity44 's form were to continue as it was they would finish ninth based on last season 's points totals @entity44 have had some reasonable patches this season but have failed to turn that into points @entity65 's side might need to win roughly 2.3 points per game if they want their customary @entity69 spot			1
one team that can afford to be pleased with their performances , though , is @entity73			2
@entity75 's side are currently picking up a staggering 2.6 points per @entity77 if they carry on at that rate they will end the season on 98.8 points , which would break the current @entity11 record			2
even if @entity85 were to win as many points as they did last year ( 86 ) , at this rate @entity73 would still be champions by @entity87			0
@entity75 will be delighted with how his @entity73 side have performed so far this season if @entity73 's form continues they will likely have the @entity11 won by @entity87			1

continuation of @entity1 's form could see them face relegation fight
@entity44 are likely to finish mid-table if performances do n't improve
@entity73 could be @entity11 champions by @entity99
