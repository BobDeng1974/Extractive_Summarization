by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 7 april 2013 a @entity2 woman claiming to have purchased @entity4 painting for $ 7 at a flea market has been unmasked and is now under @entity7 investigation after it emerged the painting was stolen in 1951			1
@entity11 ' @entity10 from @entity12 , @entity2 , had tried to remain anonymous and said she purchased the painting simply for its frame and had no special ‘ understanding of art. ’ but it has now emerged that the painting ' on the @entity19 ' was reported stolen from the @entity20 in 1951 , according to the @entity21			1
the @entity7 seized the painting late last year after learning that information and it has since emerged that @entity10 's mother was a painter who specialised in reproducing the work of several artists including @entity4			1
it was gifted to the museum after its purchase from a @entity44 art collector in the 1920s			1
a few decades later , it vanished she said , only to appear in the hands of @entity10 at auction last year			1
after the auction house was contacted by a @entity21 reporter who revealed the piece 's theft , the @entity7 stepped in , immediately removing the painting from @entity10 ’s possession			1
in a letter to the agency in december , @entity10 - who runs a driving school and is a retired physical education teacher - declared her innocence while demanding its return to her			1
' i have a layperson ’s understanding of art , ' she said in her letter obtained by the @entity21			2
stolen : in 1951 the @entity20 reported this painting , on the @entity69 , stolen with the @entity7 seizing it just days before it was to be sold at auction late last year ' i am not an art dealer or broker , art historian or art collector , and have no special education , training or experience which would give me expertise in the field of fine art or in particular , in the identification of authentic @entity85 impressionistic works , ' she wrote			1
but her null experience in art does n't appear to be entirely true , according to the @entity21			0
until now ms @entity10 's name was hidden from the public - she referred to herself only as ' @entity90 ' in a september interview			2
@entity10 's mother graduated @entity93 with a degree in fine art , before in 1957 receiving a master ’s degree from the @entity98 she then opened up an art school which her daughter for a time helped her run , the @entity21 reports			1
@entity10 's professional background consists of having taught middle school physical education and working as a casino blackjack dealer , according to the @entity21			1
adding an unexpected twist , a man who identified himself as @entity10 's brother , @entity110 , later told the @entity21 that the painting 's origin may not have been all his sister said			1
' [ my mother has ] had it for a long time , probably 50 or 60 years , ' he said of the painting			0
fight : the museum , pictured , hopes the painting will be returned but @entity10 insists that it is hers and purchased without knowing its true value or having any special art knowledge ' my girlfriend and her friends were cleaning out my mom ’s studio , and my sister stepped in and said , " wow , i want this			1
" all i know is my sister did n’t just go buy it at a flea market			0
. my sister kind of snagged it out of my mom ’s art studio			0
' he added that his mother and sister ' are keeping me out of the loop			0
it was supposed to be mine			0
' the man later retracted what he told the @entity21 , saying he does n't ' know the facts			0
' after a third phone call he told the @entity21 that someone posing as him had answered the phone			0
he said that person has since been arrested			0
in @entity10 's september interview she told the @entity21 , ' it ’s all very coincidental ... i am one of those people that believes that things happen for a reason			2
' ' i noticed the frame on this picture and i liked the frame			0
i bid $ 7 and i won the box , ' she said			0
though the frame boldly shows a center plaque reading @entity4 on it , she said she never thought that it would be authentic , it having been found in a box at a flea market after all			2
she said she stored it in a plastic trash bag for two years , even in a shed at one point , before having it authenticated as a genuine @entity4			2
@entity35 hopes that however the @entity7 ’s investigation ends , it will with the painting ’s return to the museum			2
' a number of people have submitted or individuals or organizations have submitted pleadings regarding it and the court will make a decision , ' she said			0
