the required wool fabric was made in just three weeks and has been hung in a number of rooms in the @entity37 , including the famous @entity10			1
and in a further stroke of luck , mr @entity24 's election means his curtains will hang on the walls of power for another four years			1
the father - of - three said : ' my dad started with nothing , making ties in a lock - up garage and now we have curtains hanging in the @entity37			1
' they were designed and developed specifically for them at the request of @entity55 which is really flattering , we are so proud			2
expert snipper : @entity0 , 46 , from @entity21 who designed the curtain patterns for the @entity10 ' we have always prided ourselves on quality and design and hopefully that is reflected in our products			2
i ’m very pleased the @entity63 seemed to like our work			1
' i have a little piece left , and you never know , i may make some cushions for myself from it one day			0
' @entity20 was founded in 1973 by mr @entity0 's father @entity69 , 74 , in a lock - up garage in @entity21 , @entity22			0

' i feel really lucky that i get to travel around the world and meet all these brilliant people			0
' the family ’s crowning moment came in september 2010 when they received a call from mr @entity91 , who became a fan nearly 10 years ago when he unwittingly began to use their fabric for various projects			1
impressive : mr @entity0 's curtains provide a colourful backdrop to the @entity10 mr @entity91 had been commissioned by first lady @entity55 to furnish the inside of the @entity37 , which included replacing the brown curtains hung by former president @entity131 , and wanted to use the family ’s fabric			1
mr @entity0 and company designer @entity134 set to work and three weeks later a sample was sent to the @entity37 for personal approval			1
after being given the green light , 120 yards of the fabric was dispatched to a curtain - maker in @entity111 for cutting in january last year the finished design has hung in the @entity37 ever since			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i suggested we make them out of pure wool and give it a two tone effect which , from a distance , would look like one block colour			0
' i think the design works really well			0
they hang beautifully and really look the part			2
' we made 135 yards but only shipped 120 , i have kept the remaining 15 for myself			0
' this is a family business , it always has been , and i really hope i can pass that legacy onto my children			0
