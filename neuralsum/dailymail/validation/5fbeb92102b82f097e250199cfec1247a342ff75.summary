ministers have been accused of putting profit over human rights after organising a secretive arms fair to sell tear gas and rubber bullets to a host of authoritarian regimes			2
the three - day ' @entity8 ' , which is closed to the public and press , has been organised by the @entity11 to showcase @entity13 anti-riot kit to dozens of foreign governments , including @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 sniper rifles , phone - hacking equipment and specialist ' sound guns ' will be available to help foreign police control uprisings			1
ministers have organised an arms fair to sell anti-riot equipment to foreign governments including rubber bullets , like those used by police against protesters in @entity31 , @entity32 last year 2014 the government has publicised the event as a unique opportunity for arms manufacturers to market equipment ' which would be too sensitive to show in a more - open environment '			1
since the @entity41 came to power in 2010 , £ 15.9million worth of export licences for crowd - control have been approved by @entity44 's @entity43			1
this includes £ 10million of tear gas or ' anti-riot irritants ' , £ 640,000 of ' crowd - control ammunition ' and £ 3.1million of riot shields			1
much of the kit is sold to democracies like @entity52 and the @entity53			2
but crowd - control supplies have also been cleared for countries on the government 's own human - rights blacklist			2
nine of the countries to receive export approvals - @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity17 and @entity15 - feature or have featured on the @entity69 's human rights blacklist of ' @entity70 ' over the last five years			1
the figures - compiled from @entity57 data by the @entity73 - show that goods worth £ 6.7m were cleared for shipping to the nine countries between 2010 and last september			0
since the @entity41 came to power it has signed off export licenses for anti-riot equipment to foreign regimes , including @entity66 under @entity79 ( left ) and @entity80 some £ 2.95m of tear gas was sold to @entity15 and £ 228,000 of ' crowd - control ammunition ' to @entity66 while @entity79 remained in power , the @entity81 reported			1
@entity85 , from @entity73 , told the newspaper : ' this is a sign of a system that puts arms - company profits ahead of human rights			0
weapons like tear gas have an indiscriminate effect and are synonymous with internal repression			0
' the government may have revoked the licence for tear gas to @entity66 , but it should never have been signed in the first place			0
@entity79 was a brutal tyrant from day one , and this is a reminder that acts of oppression by his regime were carried out with @entity13 support			2
' the government insists licences will not be granted when there is a ' clear risk ' that the exports ' might be used to facilitate internal repression '			0
in a statement , the @entity43 said : ' we rigorously examine every licence application on a case - by - case basis against internationally recognised criteria			0
' risks around human rights abuses are a key part of our assessment and we do not grant licences where there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression			0
