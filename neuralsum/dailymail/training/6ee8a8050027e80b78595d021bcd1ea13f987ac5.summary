ms @entity24 said : ' @entity0 is meant to be serving a 29 year sentence in a real prison - not a haven for paedophiles			1
' i know how evil this man is and people like him will never change and need to be punished severely			0
' he and they need to be out of their comfort zone of swapping sick stories with other paedophiles and in a real prison to serve their time			2
' if not then where is the punishment for them and justice for the many children and families these evil predators have destroyed ? ' you may as well have put them up in an @entity52 having a constant paedophile convention			0
' she was arrested last year for possession of indecent images of children that @entity0 had sent her over the internet but cleared by a jury after a week - long trial			1
the court heard she had repeatedly tried to show the images to police and report his paedophile activities for four years before @entity0 was arrested			0

he was originally sent to the @entity95 in @entity97 - dubbed ' @entity96 ' because it houses some of the most heinous murderers in the @entity99 including april @entity102 ' paedophile killer @entity100			0

the @entity110 has refused to confirm or deny the prison move but said they were determined to have ' one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders '			1
an @entity117 spokeswoman said : ' on the basis of the available evidence the current strategy is to concentrate sex offenders together			2
' by doing this , we aim to place sex offenders in prisons that offer specialist assessment and interventions and take account of research findings that indicate that on balance , sex offenders are more able to concentrate on rehabilitation if co-located away from a non sex offender population			2
' the available research that has directly examined the ethos of sex offenders units has consistently shown that prisoners are discouraged from discussing their offences with each other			2
a petition calling on justice secretary @entity23 to reverse the prison move has been launched by @entity0 ' former lover @entity24 - who repeatedly reported the singer to police and social services for four years before his arrest ' this does not mean that the risk of networking is ignored , and systems are in place to monitor and address this as necessary			1
' apart from the provision of specialist interventions and services , and the expertise and experience of the staff group , there is no particular difference in the regime and facilities available to prisoners with a predominantly sex offender population from other prisons			0
' eight jails in @entity169 and @entity170 now house only sex offenders as the number of abusers has rocketed to more than 11,000			1
@entity174 , operations manager at @entity175 for people abused in @entity177 , said : ' it is disturbing that there are serious sex offenders who are able to mix with their own kind			2
' we have to recognise there are people in society who have these urges and they have to be treated and one day they are going to be released			0
' but by letting them mix solely with people like themselves that does not seem like it will help			0
' from the point of view of the survivors who were affected by these horrific crimes it sends out the wrong message			0
' we should be punishing these criminals and not letting them swap sick stories , if not other materials			0
' we know that on sex offender wings in @entity203 prisons in the past there have been child abuse videos found along with other contraband such as drugs			0
' mr @entity174 said there was a ' real concern ' about whether @entity0 is co-operating fully with his sex offenders treatment and admits to the seriousness of his crimes			1
he said : ' we have n't seen anything to say he is and he has been appealing against his sentencing			0
he needs to recognise what he did was wrong			0
