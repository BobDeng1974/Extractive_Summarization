by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 stars put their club rivalries to one side as players from @entity7 and @entity8 competed in a basketball match			1
the game paired @entity11 and @entity12 against @entity13 and @entity14 - with an ( over ) enthusiastic video commentary from @entity16			1
the @entity7 striker became so involved in what was , in truth , an extraordinarily average exhibition of co-ordination between professional sportsmen that he even turned away picture hunters by squealing : ' not now baby ! i 've got ta record this '			0
nonetheless , @entity3 's talisman was involved in the game 's only highlight when he blocked a shot from the equally diminutive @entity13 - not quite clash of the titles but enough to send @entity16 into hysterics			2
unfortunately , the video ends just as @entity11 shoots from the three - point line with a nicely arced shot , the outcome of which may never be known			0
not now baby ! video commentator @entity64 was so engrossed he turned away photo hunters up in the air : @entity11 and @entity13 at @entity3 's training session in @entity68 on monday pointing the way to glory : @entity13 could start for @entity3 against @entity71 in @entity72 on saturday low expectations : @entity12 celebrates after @entity11 manages to keep out @entity13 's effort			0
