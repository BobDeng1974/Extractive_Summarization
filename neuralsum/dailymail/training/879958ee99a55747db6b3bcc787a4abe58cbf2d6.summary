petrol prices across @entity1 are expected to rise in the next two weeks as the government introduces a new tariff on fuel companies			1
finance minister @entity5 announced the new tax , which will increase from 38.143 cents a litre to 38.6 cents a litre from november 10 , during a press conference on tuesday			1
it is expected to cost the average @entity1 household , which consumes about 50 litres of petrol each week , an extra 40 cents a week by the end of the next financial year			1
however , if the opposition parties fail to approve the change when it is reviewed by parliament in 12 months time , mr @entity5 warned that the money would be returned to fuel companies rather than the paying motorists			1
finance minister @entity5 announced the new tax , which will initially increase from 38.143 cents a litre to 38.6 cents a litre from november 10 , on tuesday senator @entity5 explained that the government had bypassed the parliament and will use ' tariff proposals ' , to be tabled in parliament this week , to bring about the hike			1
he downplayed the effect the tax would have on motorists , describing it as a ' very modest ' rise , but said the $ 2.2 billion dollars that it would raise for the government over four years would go far in providing structural reform			2
' while the impact on individual households will be modest , this measure will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue , which will help the government boost its investment in job creating and productivity enhancing road infrastructure , ' senator @entity5 said			0
' in the budget , we 've announced a record investment on infrastructure - $ 50 billion dollars - and our commitment remains for 100 per cent of the money collected by the fuel excise indexation to go into road infrastructure investment , ' senator @entity5 told @entity51			2
the average @entity1 household , which consumes about @entity53 of petrol a week , is expected to eventually be paying an extra 40 cents a week the finance minister told reporters the parliament 's support would be needed to validate the measure within 12 months			1
' if the measure is not validated within 12 months - and we 're confident it will be , by the way - the money would have to go back to those that have paid the excise and the duty , ' senator @entity5 said			2
' it will go back to fuel manufacturers and to fuel importers , who would essentially have a windfall gain at that time			0
' opposition leader @entity73 , called the move a ' new sneaky tax on @entity1 motorists ' and slammed the federal government for being ' so addicted to new taxes ' however , mr @entity5 said there would be ' no requirement ' for fuel manufacturers and importers to pass the windfall on to road users			0
he said he expected @entity85 and the @entity86 to ' see sense ' within a year and that the money should be used for roads and not go back to fuel companies			0
opposition leader @entity73 , called the move a ' new sneaky tax on @entity1 motorists ' and slammed prime minister @entity94 for going back on election promises that his government would not see the introduction of any new taxes			0
senator @entity5 revealed the tax would raise $ 2.2 billion dollars for the government over four years he said the move came less than 24 hours after prime minister @entity94 told parliament he wanted a ' mature discussion ' about tax			1
' yet today he ambushes @entity1 motorists , ambushes the parliament of @entity1 and through the back door has launched a sneak attack on the wallets and cost of living of every @entity1 , ' mr @entity73 told reporters in @entity111			0
he does n't have the courage to take his new taxes to an election			0
he is desperate to prop up his unfair budget			0
