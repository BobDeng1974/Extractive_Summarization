by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:18 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 22 may 2013 @entity3 took so many tablets in her fight against cancer that her mother described her as a human ‘ rattle ’			1
on top of the gruelling chemotherapy treatment , the 11 - year - old needed nearly 50 tablets , medicines and ointments a week to combat the wide variety of side effects			2
it meant her battle against leukaemia became like a military operation			0
@entity3 was on so many medications that her mother , @entity22 , branded her the ' human rattle '			1
she required treatment to combat the effects of the chemotherapy which ranged from nosebleeds to dry skin she was diagnosed after she and her brother , @entity29 , eight , both developed chest infections and her cough failed to improve			0
tests showed her white blood cell count was low , and at the start of 2012 she became very unwell the family put up a large whiteboard that filled an entire wall in the dining room and wrote down a detailed schedule , with every type of medicine , dose required and time of day to be taken clearly set out			1
it was also vital @entity3 was suitably hydrated to protect her kidneys from the strong medicines and the board was used to keep a tally of her drinks of water			1
thankfully the treatment and her careful tablet - taking worked well			0
@entity3 was treated at @entity53 where she underwent a gruelling course of chemotherapy which left her so weak that she had to spend most of the last two years in a wheelchair cocktail of drugs.jpg she was given the all - clear from cancer a few weeks ago and is now delighted to be off her medication and planning a return to school			1
her mother @entity63 , 33 , a nursery nurse , said that at one stage @entity3 had to take 11 pills in a single dose and ‘ put them all on one spoon ’			1
she continued : ‘ i used to say she would rattle , she was taking that many tablets			0
‘ we drew a weekly timetable because she was taking tablets at different times of the day and we were so worried we were going to mix up her doses			0
the chemotherapy was lowering her immune system which was making her really susceptible to all different kinds of infections and illnesses			0
’ @entity3 , from @entity80 , was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in february 2011 after she appeared to fail to recover from a chest infection			1
mrs @entity3 , her businessman husband @entity83 , 38 , and their son @entity29 , eight , were shattered by the news			2
the schoolgirl immediately started two years of treatment at @entity53 and she is now on the mend			0
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ the hospital have been amazing , they scooped us up and told us what they were going to do			2
from then on you do n’t have time to think about it			0
’ although @entity3 will need check - ups for years to come , doctors say she is in remission			1
‘ she can come off treatment and this huge amount of medication and get back to normal life , ’ said mrs @entity3			2
as a result of the treatment and medication , @entity3 ( pictured with brother @entity29 and father , @entity83 ) , developed unusual food cravings and would ask for sunday roasts late at night			0
however , when provided with the food she was often unable to eat anything the family ( l to @entity112 : @entity29 , @entity22 , @entity83 and @entity3 ) are now looking forward to their lives getting back to normal and @entity3 , who has missed a year of school , if looking forward to starting year 7 in september			2
