one treatment , which involves inserting needles 2mm deep on five points around the outer ear , was particularly effective at tackling a bulging waistline			0
but even targeting one spot termed the ‘ hunger ’ point produced results , they said			0
participants in a two - month study saw their body mass index ( @entity31 ) drop by up to 6 per cent and also had less body fat and a smaller waist , says a report published online in the journal @entity36			1
so - called auricular acupuncture therapy is based on the understanding that the outer ear represents all parts of the body			1
