speaking ahead of the tenth anniversary of 9/11 the prime minister said that for the sake of international security , president @entity20 must be ousted from power			1
' if @entity2 were to acquire nuclear weapons capability it would destabilise the region very , very badly			2
' if they were to do that - even now in @entity29 they 're still interfering where they can and as much as they can			2
i think regime change in @entity36 would immediately make me significantly more optimistic about the whole of the region , ' he told @entity39			2
mr @entity0 , who is now peace envoy for the @entity40 , blames @entity2 for the lengths of the @entity29 and @entity43 conflicts - wars that he led the @entity45 into alongside @entity46			2

he said that president @entity62 has shown he can not take @entity3 through the process of change and must give up power and is unable to invoke reforms			1
mr @entity0 stopped short of suggesting @entity84 - style military intervention in the country but implored the international community to ' do everything it can now to hasten that '			0
he said : ' his position is untenable			0
i was saying even two or three months ago , if he genuinely showed that he was prepared to lead a process of reform , then i would give him the chance to make the evolution work			1
' however , he adds that it will be difficult for @entity62 to start making political reform towards democracy as he knows that at the end of the process he would not be elected as president			1
@entity0 in @entity66 where he heard about the attacks			0
he went straight back to @entity102 and he said he knew straightaway that the attacks would change the politics of global security if @entity0 's mission against terrorism was not started by the events of 9/11 , then it was at least heightened			1
he was in @entity66 preparing to give a speech to the @entity68 when the planes flew into the @entity70 in @entity71			0
