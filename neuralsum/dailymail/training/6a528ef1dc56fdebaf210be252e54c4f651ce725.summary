by @entity0 published : 20:57 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:57 est , 15 november 2013 eleventh - hour : @entity1 , 40 , was due to be put to death on thursday but was issued a stay of execution so he could give his liver to his mother a death row inmate has had his execution rescheduled so he can donate a kidney to his mother			1
less than a day before child killer @entity1 was set to die by lethal injection , the governor of @entity11 called it off			1
@entity1 , 40 , who raped and killed a three - year - old girl , also wants to give his heart to his sister			1
‘ i realise this is a bit of uncharted territory for @entity11 , but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen , ’ governor @entity17 said			1
his sister , who has serious heart problems , might not be able to use the heart because it may be poisoned by the lethal chemicals			1
the execution will now take place on july 2 , 2014			2
critics have questioned whether the condemned can freely give consent , or are desperately hoping to win clemency			1
they worry such practices could make judges and juries more likely to hand out death sentences			2
and they are troubled by the notion of using inmates for spare parts			0
medical ethicist @entity43 of @entity44 said organ donation is incompatible with the goals of punishment			0
' it 's unethical because this guy who 's being executed raped and killed a 3 - year - old			1
when you donate your organs , there 's a kind of redemption , ' @entity43 said			1
postponed : child killer @entity56 will now be executed on a gurney similar to this next july ' punishment and organ donation do n't go well together			1
i do n't think the kinds of people we 're executing we want to make in any way heroic			0
' yet it 's not unheard of for a death row inmate to become an organ donor			1
condemned @entity70 inmate @entity69 was allowed to donate a kidney to his mother in 1995 , though his execution was n't imminent			0
controversial : governor of @entity11 @entity17 said the decision was ' uncharted territory ' in 1996 , the @entity77 halted @entity79 's execution so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother			1
his brother was too ill for surgery and later died			0
requests in other states , including @entity86 , have been rejected			0
all involved so - called live donations , never donation of a vital organ like a heart			1
@entity91 , executive director of the @entity93 - based @entity92 , which opposes capital punishment , said the practice raises troubling concerns			1
' once you put the person into the death row or execution category , then their life becomes less in the equation of things , ' he said			0
' that 's a slippery slope of one life being used to save another			2
' @entity107 , a spokeswoman for the @entity108 , said in a statement that her organization 's ethics committee in 2007 deemed the practice ' morally reprehensible			2
' she said the committee sees extreme difficulty ' in ensuring that a condemned prisoner could give proper informed consent for donation , free from any coercion or consideration of personal gain			2
' @entity43 said keeping vital organs viable during executions would require avoiding lethal injection , electrocution and other methods that would harm them			1
@entity128 murderer @entity127 , executed by firing squad in 1977 , agreed to donate his eyes , kidneys , liver and pituitary gland for medical use			0
his kidneys proved unusable because of bullet wounds			0
' the only way i can think of to get organs out of prisoners is to shoot them in the head or guillotine them , ' @entity43 said			0
' are we really going to have witnessed executions of that type ? i do n't think so			0
' dr. @entity148 , the director of the @entity149 and a transplant cardiologist , said it would be possible to use some organs after an execution , including the liver and kidney , but not the heart			2
even so , he said he is opposed to the idea , saying it could lead a judge or jury to believe that handing down a death sentence could help save another 's life			2
precedent : in 1996 , @entity79 's ( left ) execution was halted so he could donate a kidney to his sick brother and @entity127 , agreed to donate body parts for science before his execution in 1966 ' one would worry that the enticement of organ donation could somehow be perceived , even subconsciously , as some kind of perverse incentive			1
i think that 's wrong , ' @entity148 said			2
' there are certainly accusations of prisoners being executed in other countries for organ donation , and we have to be well above that			0
' states such as @entity184 , @entity128 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity86 have nonetheless considered policies promoting organ donation among inmates			0
some proposals would shorten sentences in exchange for organ or bone marrow donations			0
some transplant recipients think such donations could be a good thing			0
' i do n't know who my donor is and i really do n't care , " said @entity198 , a 57 - year - old accountant and financial adviser who underwent a heart transplant nearly two years ago			1
' it gave me my life back , and i 'm a single dad with a couple kids who suddenly got their father back			0

@entity1 , 40 , was due to receive lethal injection on thursday in @entity11
raped and murdered his girlfriend 's three - year - old daughter in 1993
but governor @entity17 called it off at the eleventh hour appeal
child killer also wants to give his heart to his sister before he dies
critics say it could set a precedent of *offenders* trying to win clemency
