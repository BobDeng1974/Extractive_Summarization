it was by any standards an unlikely and quite bizarre foray into the turbulent world of @entity3			1
so what could possibly have prompted @entity5 to pass comment on the minimum wage ? who could he be referring to ? already on this tour we have had the @entity12 blackmail plot and now came another unexpected twist to life with the @entity16 cricket team when @entity5 found himself having to defend comments on the worldwide strength of @entity20 pay levels			1
@entity5 tried to calm the @entity3 storm over his unlikely comments on the minimum wage @entity16 bowler @entity5 walks with his partner @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , on tuesday there was only one conclusion to be reached here in scorching hot @entity26 and that was that @entity5 , one of the players attacked by @entity32 in his controversial autobiography , was having a subtle dig at his bête noire			1
it was @entity32 , of course , who caused another rumble here last weekend with his comments about the need for changes to the structure of the domestic game and his belief that only the fittest should survive in county cricket			1
‘ @entity46 that only earn £ 15 to £ 18 grand should either get better or get out and do something else , ’ @entity32 had said			1
so was that what caused @entity5 , who was accused of bullying by @entity32 in his book and of ‘ not being the sharpest , ’ to have a dabble in the world of financial politics ? no , insisted @entity5 , who had tweeted ‘ i ’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in @entity16 you ’re in the 10 per cent top earners in the world			1
‘ it was genuinely innocent , ’ said @entity5 at the end of another long and gruelling @entity16 training session in temperatures touching 40 degrees			1
‘ i heard that stat and i was quite surprised and amazed at the size of the world			2
@entity5 takes part in a fitness drill and a nets session at the @entity72 with @entity16 on tuesday ‘ that was all that was in it			1
i put two more tweets out to try and clarify and emphasise that i did n’t meant any offence if anyone took it that way			2
he even came to @entity32 ’s defence over what were , to be fair , constructive comments about the best way forward for @entity86 cricket in @entity16			1
‘ to back him up a bit he does use that word ( muppet ) about himself sometimes , ’ said @entity5 at the @entity72			1
‘ but the development role in the county game is very important			1
no - one ’s going to come in and start on big wages			2
‘ you have to earn your stripes			0
i think that figure @entity97 used is a bit below the minimum earned anyway so it was a bit off the mark			2
i do n’t think he meant any offence by it			0
it was just a little bit misguided i think			0
’ at times like this you do wonder why on earth any public figure would get involved in @entity3			1
all it seems to bring them is a torrent of abuse when they attempt to say anything even vaguely different			0
but @entity5 has not been put off			1
‘ i do n’t look at my mentions on @entity3 so i did n’t see the response , ’ he said			1
‘ i only heard second hand			0
there ’s a notification thing where you can only see it when people you follow mention you			0
the people i follow were n’t that bothered about it to be honest			0
bowler @entity126 ( left ) and @entity5 get put through their paces in the @entity129 sun ‘ we ’re quite lucky in the abuse we receive compared to footballers			1
i ’ d hate to see @entity133 ’s @entity3 mentions after he ’s lost a game			1
it ’s part and parcel of the world now			2
you ’re more open to everything , are n’t you ? it was n’t a mistake			0
it was just a genuine comment and i did n’t think about the other side of it			0
the stay humble hash tag was aimed at myself to remind us how lucky we are			1
maybe i misjudged it a bit but hopefully it will die down a bit now			0
’ @entity5 was far more comfortable talking about his return to the @entity16 side after knee surgery that caused him to miss the one - day tour of @entity156 before @entity157			1
he has appeared to be easing his way back here in the tri-series which precedes the @entity161			1
‘ four and a half months is a long lay off and i think when you get back you grow with every game , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve got a lot of experience but there ’s nothing like getting out in the middle			0
realistically i can look at my performances and say i ’ve bowled one or two too many bad balls and given away cheap fours which you ca n’t afford to do in one - day cricket now			0
‘ i also know that i ’ve gone through games where i have n’t taken wickets and then picked up a handful so hopefully come semi-final and final time in the @entity161 it will be my chance to shine			1
’ his pace has been down here so now , with @entity5 bowling at no more than 81 or 82 miles per hour for the most part , and that man @entity32 for one said at the weekend that he was a bit concerned about @entity16 ’s match - winning bowler			1
@entity5 insists there is no cause for alarm			1
‘ a bit of extra pace comes with the rhythm and the match feeling i suppose			0
i feel like i ’m running in nicely and i ’ve had no problems with the knee whatsoever			0
and i ’ve had quite a decent workload			0
it ’s been good to be involved again			0
@entity5 , pictured during @entity16 's recent odi against @entity26 , has come in for criticism for his tweet @entity5 bowls during @entity16 's defeat to @entity26 in their @entity202 match in @entity203 last week he is looking forward to tomorrow ’s match here against @entity206 which will see the winners take on @entity26 on sunday in the tri-series final			1
‘ @entity25 is where you want to bowl as a tall bowler so hopefully we can do to @entity206 what we did to them in @entity216			2
i ’ve not taken the wickets i want to up to now but i feel i ’m delivering what ’s in my mind			0
the way one - day cricket is , wickets will come to you when it ’s your time			0
when it ’s your day you have to cash in			0
’ while @entity5 and @entity225 are easing their way back after injury , @entity223 and @entity224 have impressed for @entity16			1
‘ you only need to look at the amount of wickets @entity231 has taken in the last 15 or 20 one - day internationals , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ he ’s done fantastically well and i think from watching him in the nets he ’s developed a bit more of a snap at the crease			0
that has given him a bit more pace and i hope he can take that form into the @entity161			2
‘ but the biggest change in confidence is in @entity244			0
just the way he ’ s been around the group			0
his head is up a lot more			0
he ’s a lot clearer on what he wants to work on in the nets and it was great to see him get that five - for in @entity216			0
it was just rewards for how he has been improving			0
’ it is the lack of variety in @entity16 ’s attack that worries onlookers			1
‘ teams have won @entity260 without left - armers before , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ you can see from @entity86 stats that they have good records in white ball cricket and every team would want one in their side			0
but there is enough variety in our attack with the different heights and each bowler has different slower balls and that sort of thing			2
we ’re just looking to put a complete game together			2
’ and stay humble in the process .			2
