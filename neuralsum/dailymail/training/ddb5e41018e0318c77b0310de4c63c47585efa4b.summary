by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd neither @entity1 nor @entity2 could get past @entity4 's deep defence in @entity5 as @entity7 's two key threats suffered without being able to show their usual counter attacking talents			1
and in the end , after failing to break down the tournament 's surprise package , it came down to penalties			2
both dispatched their spot kicks and then @entity18 played hero from the bench to send the @entity21 through			0
@entity1 might have made a renewed effort to stay on his feet after talk about his diving dominated the post match coverage following the 2 - 1 win over @entity28 , but he need n't have - @entity4 constantly kicked him as they tried to stop his attacking runs by hook or by crook			1
relief : @entity1 and @entity2 enjoy their shootout win after a tough game against @entity4 at last ! @entity37 finally gets the ball past @entity39 - from the spot in the penalty shoot out me too : and @entity1 confidently dispatched his into the top corner no ! @entity37 could n't believe his lack of luck as chance after chance went begging tough night : @entity1 was kicked all over the place as he struggled to make an impact in @entity5 thwarted : @entity39 so often stopped @entity37 during normal and extra time @entity37 was unlucky with his finishing on multiple occasions			1
it was a frustrating night for the @entity21 - and none moreso than their two top scorers			0
both @entity37 and @entity1 have thrived on the counter attack in this @entity57 so far but @entity4 's defensive solidity rarely allowed them to take that sort of opportunity			1
in the first half 's one occasion where they were able to break with pace , their opponents found another solution : bringing @entity1 down with a cynical challenge as he tried to break into their half			2
@entity37 did have one decent effort at goal but it was easily saved by the excellent @entity72			1
but it did n't - the second half looked to be going even worse from the off			0
@entity4 became even more willing to sit deep and frustrate their illustrious opponents			1
manager @entity78 kept both of his danger men on - unlike against @entity28 - and threw on reinforcements but still neither man was really firing			0
@entity1 still caused problems for the defence but he was often brought down by challenges designed to stop him in his tracks - no need to dive this time			1
@entity37 could have won it with two minutes left but missed the ball to waste a gilt - edged chance			2
but by the time the whistle blew for the end of normal time the @entity92 man must have been seriously cursing his luck after his shot was cleared onto the crossbar by @entity100 's misskick off the line			1
as a pairing - they had no luck			0
two extra time shots from @entity1 were deflected away from goal by @entity37 , it just did not seem to be their night			1
@entity37 then @entity1 both dispatched theirs , with @entity18 saving twice to get @entity7 through			1
both forwards will be hoping the luck that only joined their side for penalties will continue into the semi final against @entity115 and beyond			0
8 minutes : @entity1 goes on a dangerous charge down the right flank but @entity118 puts a stop to him on the byline			2
21 minutes : @entity37 has a great chance but he fires it with power straight at @entity72 who palms it away			1
24 minutes : @entity1 runs at the @entity125 defence and plays the ball wide to @entity127 who finds @entity37 but he 's offside			1
28 minutes : it 's @entity37 's turn to run at @entity4 's back five before playing it to @entity131 to shoot			1
34 minutes : @entity1 leads a rare @entity7 counter but he is scythed down as he breaks into the opposition half			1
41 minutes : the @entity135 winger slips @entity37 in but @entity39 comes and claims the ball ahead of him			0
51 minutes : @entity1 has been staying on his feet so far but he justifiably goes down after being brought down by @entity138 and @entity139 together			0
the latter goes into the book			0
55 minutes : the winger pokes a ball through to @entity37 after considering his options on the right hand side			0
the recipient ca n't quite make up his mind what to do but he wins a corner			0
80 minutes : @entity1 is dragged down by @entity118 just outside the area and he took earns himself a booking			0
83 minutes : @entity37 does n't appear to be having any luck - the brilliant @entity153 denies him again			0
88 minutes : @entity154 calls in a brilliant ball and @entity37 just has to get a touch to convert it but he completely misses the ball and the chance is gone			2
the best chance of the game			0
90 minutes : @entity1 breaks past @entity138 who again fouls him			1
he should see red but gets away with it			0
91 minutes : @entity162 hits his free kick straight at @entity153 , then his drive at the back post is cleared off the line and onto the crossbar by @entity100 - somehow the ball does n't go in			0
101 minutes : @entity1 is still full of steam and he runs down the right , cuts in but has his shot blocked			0
he ends up on the ball again and this time it 's blocked by @entity175 - the referee deems it to be his arm and gives another free kick			2
106 minutes : another way to stop @entity1 - @entity179 goes in for the challenge on the @entity21 right wing and it ends up with a clash of heads which brings @entity1 crashing to the ground for yet another free kick			2
116 minutes : @entity1 sees his chance to win it cutting in from the right and ignores @entity37 and @entity189 - @entity188 in the box			2
in the end his shot actually hits @entity37			0
118 minutes : @entity154 hits the bar , it comes back to @entity1 but again his shot hits @entity37 ! @entity37 's penalty : he goes low to the right and it just evades @entity153 ' dive to nestle in the corner of the net			1
@entity1 's penalty : sends @entity18 the wrong way by thrashing his penalty confidently into the top left hand corner			2
tricky : @entity1 makes one of his trademark runs , bursting past the @entity125 back line hot shot : @entity37 fires in an effort in the first half that is saved by @entity72 hard work : @entity1 took a few kicks from the @entity125 as they tried to neutralise the danger marked man : @entity4 's @entity138 and @entity118 give @entity37 no room to move			1

@entity7 's star men struggle against opposition who sit deep
@entity72 makes a string of saves to deny them both
@entity37 misses two *fantastic* chances at the death in normal time
@entity1 won eight fouls as @entity4 turned dirty to stop him
neither could get past the *underdogs* as game goes to penalties
@entity37 scores his spot kick , as does @entity1
