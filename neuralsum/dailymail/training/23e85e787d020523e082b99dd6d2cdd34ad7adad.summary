by @entity1 reporter published : 00:28 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 04:32 est , 3 may 2013 killer robots that can attack targets without any human input ' should not have the power of life and death over human beings , ' a new draft @entity3 report says			1
the report for the @entity13 this week has called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of killer robots until an international conference can develop rules for their use			1
according to the report , the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 have developed various types of fully or semi-autonomous weapons			1
report says killer robots , such as the @entity30 aircraft , pictured , should ' not have power to destroy human life ' the @entity13 deals with legal and philosophical issues involved in giving robots lethal powers over humans , echoing countless science - fiction novels and films			1
report author @entity39 , a @entity40 professor of human rights law , focuses on a new generation of weapons that choose their targets and execute them			1
he calls them ' lethal autonomous robotics , ' or @entity48 for short , and says : ' decisions over life and death in armed conflict may require compassion and intuition			0
' humans - while they are fallible - at least might possess these qualities , whereas robots definitely do not			2
' he notes the arguments of robot proponents that death - dealing autonomous weapons ' will not be susceptible to some of the human shortcomings that may undermine the protection of life			2
' typically they would not act out of revenge , panic , anger , spite , prejudice or fear			0
moreover , unless specifically programmed to do so , robots would not cause intentional suffering on civilian populations , for example through torture			0
robots also do not rape			0
' his findings are due to be debated at the @entity81 in @entity82 on may 29			0
the report goes beyond the recent debate over drone killings of @entity87 suspects and nearby civilians who are maimed or killed in the air strikes			0
the report said killer robots differed from drones , pictured , because there is human control over drone use drones do have human oversight			1
the killer robots are programmed to make autonomous decisions on the spot without orders from humans			1
@entity102 ' report notes the increasing use of drones , which ' enable those who control lethal force not to be physically present when it is deployed , but rather to activate it while sitting behind computers in faraway places , and stay out of the line of fire			0
' lethal autonomous robotics , if added to the arsenals of @entity19 , would add a new dimension to this distancing , in that targeting decisions could be taken by the robots themselves			1
in addition to being physically removed from the kinetic action , humans would also become more detached from decisions to kill - and their execution , ' he wrote			0
the report says the @entity19 's @entity123 system for @entity125 - class cruisers could fall into the category as it automatically detects , tracks and engages anti-air warfare threats such as anti-ship missiles and aircraft			1
other examples include @entity21 's @entity132 , a ' @entity134 ' autonomous weapon system designed to detect , attack and destroy radar emitters			1
@entity20 's @entity30 jet - propelled combat drone prototype also can autonomously search , identify and locate enemies but can only engage with a target when authorized by mission command			1
it also can defend itself against enemy aircraft			0
the @entity144 surveillance and security guard robots , deployed in the demilitarized zone between @entity147 , detects targets through infrared sensors			0
they are currently operated by humans but have an ' automatic mode			0
' a separate report is due for the @entity154 this year on drone warfare and targeted killings current weapons systems are supposed to have some degree of human oversight			1
but @entity39 notes that ' the power to override may in reality be limited because the decision - making processes of robots are often measured in nanoseconds and the informational basis of those decisions may not be practically accessible to the supervisor			0
' in such circumstances humans are de facto out of the loop and the machines thus effectively constitute @entity48 , ' or killer robots			1
separately , another @entity3 expert , @entity20 lawyer @entity173 , is preparing a special investigation for the @entity154 this year on drone warfare and targeted killings			2
his probe was requested by @entity176 , which officially opposes the use of @entity19 drones on its territory as an infringement on its sovereignty but is believed to have tacitly approved some strikes in the past			2
@entity176 officials say the drone strikes kill many innocent civilians , which the @entity19 has rejected			2
the other two countries requesting the investigation were two permanent members of the @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			0
in april , an alliance of activist and humanitarian groups led by @entity198 launched the ' campaign to @entity200 ' to push for a ban on fully autonomous weapons			2
the group applauded @entity39 ' draft report in a statement on its web site .			0
