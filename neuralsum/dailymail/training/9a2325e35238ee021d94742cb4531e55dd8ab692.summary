by @entity0 with its distinctive 45 - degree diagonal crown the @entity1 is one of @entity5 's most prominent skyscrapers			1
but nearly 40 years ago , as a hurricane threatened the @entity7 , @entity9 's @entity8 was hurriedly planning a mass evacuation of @entity5 in case the tower collapsed - decimating 18 blocks of @entity5 like dominoes all the way to @entity16			1
thankfully , that plan was never put into action , and the story of how just one phone call from an architecture undergraduate set off the chain of events that saved @entity9 from certain disaster went untold for almost 20 - years			1
scroll down for @entity25 iconic : the stilts of the @entity1 ( then @entity26 ) center are visible in this 1978 picture along with directions for @entity29 ( left ) when it was topped - out in 1977 , the 59 - story , $ 195 million skyscraper on @entity31 was the seventh - tallest building in the world			1
in fact , the most distinctive part of its construction are its four massive , 114 - foot - tall stilts that are located in the center of the building , rather than its corners			2
1977 's @entity9 - the new @entity1 , which occupies 74,180 square feet of a city block officially opened on 10/12			1
it is 915 feet high , which made it the seventh tallest building in the world at the time they exist because the skyscraper had to be built around the remodeled @entity29 which originally existed on the corner of 53rd street			2
but these stilts caused a potentially catastrophic structural design flaw which went unnoticed from drawing board to completion			1
had the weakness not been discovered and fixed under cover of night , the @entity1 could have come down during any of the major storms which hit @entity9 in summertime			1
while the architect of the building was @entity58 , the real genius behind its unusual design belongs to its chief engineer , @entity63			1
designing the building around the church called for the stilts so as to allow the building to start more than one hundred feet above the ground			0
because the stilts were not on the corner of the building , where they would obviously traditionally be , @entity68 came up with a brilliant chevron structure - literally eight rows of steel v 's running vertically through the building , acting as its skeleton			2
indeed , @entity78 was aware that this chevron structure would make the building very light for a skyscraper , meaning it would sway in strong winds			2
to account for that , one of the first ever tuned mass dampers - a 400 - ton concrete ball at the top of the building - that would compensate like a stabilizing force for the movement in wind , was added			0
@entity91 : the ingenious chevron design is seen here in one of the offices in the @entity1 shortly after it opened in 1977 however , one year after the building had opened , full of office workers and tens of thousands of oblivious @entity9 commuters below , @entity78 got a phone call			1
an undergraduate named @entity101 phoned him to ask for his considerable expertise on the design , which had begun to confuse her			0
she explained that her professor had expressed his own doubts about the 25,000 ton skyscraper because the stilts were not on the corners			0
' listen , i want you to tell your teacher that he does n't know what the hell he 's talking about , ' @entity63 told @entity101 according to @entity117 ' because he does n't know the problem that had to be solved			0
' the esteemed engineer , then 51 , explained to @entity101 that the tuned mass damper was in perfect alignment with the stilts and chevrons , leaving it able to withstand huge winds , especially from a diagonal angle - the most powerful			1
after putting the phone down , @entity78 decided to double check because he had been so forceful in his rebuttal of @entity101 's questions according to 99 percent @entity130 cut across : another of the huge chevrons ( there are 8 in total ) is seen to dart through the skyscraper like a skeleton he became especially fixated on a minor engineering change that took place during the construction phase			0
@entity141 discovered that the joints on the chevrons were bolts , not welds , because the actual builders of the skyscraper had not been aware that the @entity1 was vulnerable to diagonal or quartering winds			2
this set huge alarm bells off			0
usually , all buildings are strongest at the corners and winds that face full on , or perpendicular winds are the most troublesome			0
however , because of the unique design of the @entity1 , @entity78 discovered that @entity101 and her professor had made a frighteningly correct observation			1
@entity68 came to the terrifying conclusion that without the damper , a storm powerful enough to bring down the skyscraper hits @entity9 every 16 - years			1
but , that only works on the proviso that the high - tech tuned mass damper , which is powered by electricity , is operational			0
what if the storm caused a power - cut ? ethics : @entity63 was the chief engineer for the construction of the skyscraper and realized the enormous structural flaw in the building so , in the spring of 1978 , with hurricane season fast approaching , @entity78 took his findings to his friend , @entity174 , who confirmed his worst fears			1
devastated , @entity78 retreated to @entity176 , in @entity177 to work out what to do			0
his reputation might be ruined , he would possibly face bankruptcy			0
part of history : this is @entity101 - who is now a real estate consultant in @entity185 - who helped discover the massive flaw in the @entity1 he contemplated suicide			2
however , he knew that if he did n't act , tens of thousands of people would , in all probability die			0
he rushed to meet with @entity1 executives and using a book , which they slammed shut , dramatically demonstrated to the bank 's executive vice-president , @entity195 , what would happen			2
getting to work in secret in june of 1978 , @entity1 , the @entity198 and the @entity8 began work on repairs and an evacuation plan that spanned a 10 block radius			1
the public had no idea the danger they faced and a fortuitous newspaper strike helped authorities keep a lid on the crisis			0
more than 2,500 @entity214 volunteers were on standby along with three different weather services constantly watching the weather			1
welders worked through the night , after staff had left the building			0
but then in august , with repairs only half - way completed @entity221 formed off @entity223 and seemed on a collision course with @entity5			1
the evacuation plan to empty most of the eastern side of @entity5 was readied			0
luckily @entity221 did not make landfall and the repairs were completed in september , revealing the skyscraper to now be one of the sturdiest in the world			0
disaster averted : this is the course of @entity221 which caused @entity9 to plan for the worst in august of 1978 the story remained secret until reporter @entity235 overheard it being told at a party and published the piece in the @entity9 magazine in 1995			1
@entity101 did not even know she was responsible for saving thousands of lives until she saw a @entity241 documentary in the early 2000s			0
up until then , the undergraduate was anecdotally referred to as a man			0
@entity78 's swift action despite his reputation being on the line caused him to became a symbol of ethics in architecture			2
indeed , executives at @entity1 were allegedly so relived he came to them that they covered $ 6 million of the $ 8 million costs of the repairs - asking @entity68 to pay the $ 2 million maximum his insurance allowed .			2

@entity9 authorities and 2,500 @entity214 *members* prepared for the @entity1 to come crashing down on @entity5 in the summer of 1978
a catastrophic design flaw was uncovered when an architecture *student* phoned the building 's chief engineer
he discovered that the building could not withstand high winds
@entity221 began to form off the @entity7 in august 1978 - *launching* authorities into action
disaster planners believed that 18 blocks of @entity5 would be destroyed if the building came down
contingency plans were made in secret and the story was not made public for nearly 20 - years
