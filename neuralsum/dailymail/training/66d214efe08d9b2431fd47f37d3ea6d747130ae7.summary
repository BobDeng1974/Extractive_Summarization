with his marriage over , a friend told the @entity43 the magnate ' went wild , ' going on a dating binge			0
magnate : @entity3 , right , co-founded @entity4 in @entity18 , left , in 1995 after drawing inspiration from a visit to @entity8 's firm , @entity111 in an interview with the @entity113 this past january , @entity3 criticized the media of mischaracterizing him as a ‘ private equity party boy			1
’ ‘ i think the portrayal of me as having wild and crazy parties is absolutely incorrect , ’ he told the paper			0
‘ i spend a small percentage throwing some parties , attending some parties			0
but rather than reporting on how i spend 340 days and nights of my year , the media likes to report on the other 25			0
’ in the same january interview with the @entity113 , the @entity126 revealed that he was inspired to go into private equity after paying a visit to @entity8 ’s investment firm , @entity111			1
‘ mr. @entity8 was an early investor in some of the deals done by mr. @entity3 's investment company , @entity4 , which today oversees about $ 8billion in equity , ’ the article said			1
leaked : @entity35 , a liberal news magazine , says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser blunder : the resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the @entity9 lost the race to the @entity144 the @entity113 noted that @entity3 ’s firm was accused by a federal regulatory agency of pushing the fast food chain @entity148 into bankruptcy in 2011 to avoid paying pensions – a fate that was shared by some 25 companies in @entity4 ’s portfolio since 2008			1
before founding @entity4 in 1995 , @entity3 worked as a senior vice president at the now - defunct @entity155			1
on may 17 , @entity3 organized a fundraiser for @entity8 , inviting 150 wealthy donors to his home in @entity18 for a lavish dinner			2
during the party , the @entity9 nominee was taped telling the guests , among other things , that the nearly 50 per cent of voters who support the president ‘ believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you - name - it			0
exclusive event : @entity3 invited some 150 wealthy donors to his @entity18 home in may to help raise funds for @entity8 's presidential bid ' that , that 's an entitlement			1
and the government should give it to them			0
and they will vote for this president no matter what … these are people who pay no income tax			0
' he added that ' my job is not to worry about those people -- i 'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives			0
' the comments set off a firestorm in the media , prompting @entity8 to hold a late - night press conference in an attempt to minimize the damage from the leak			2
the @entity9 candidate said that @entity11 believes in ' a government - centred society ' whereas he believes in a ' free people , free enterprise , free market ' society and had an approach that would put 23 million people back to work			0
he added that ' my campaign is about helping people take more responsibility ' and ' getting people back to work			0
' @entity8 conceded only that his sentiments were ' not elegantly stated ' because he was ' speaking off the cuff			2
' battered : the @entity11 campaign quickly jumped on the statement saying @entity8 ' disdained ' half of the nation standing by his words : at a press conference on monday , @entity8 said his remarks were ' not elegantly stated , ' but did not back away from the message on its part , the @entity11 campaign quickly seized upon the controversial comments by the president ’s opponent , which came only 50 days before the november 6 election			2
in a statement reacting to the secret recordings , @entity234 , @entity11 's campaign manager , said : ' it 's shocking that a candidate for @entity239 would go behind closed doors and declare to a group of wealthy donors that half the @entity25 people view themselves as " victims " entitled to handouts , and are unwilling to take " personal responsibility " for their lives			0
' it ’s hard to serve as president for all @entity25 when you ’ve disdainfully written off half the nation			0
' @entity8 's 47 per cent figure seems to have come from a @entity254 report that found 46.4 per cent of @entity25 households paid zero income taxes or received a net refund from the government			1
but @entity8 appeared to mix up the 47 per cent of people who did not pay income tax -- many of whom pay state and local taxes and payroll taxes -- with the proportion of core @entity11 supporters			2
many of those who do n't pay income tax are @entity9 supporters -- particularly working class white men and the elderly			0
