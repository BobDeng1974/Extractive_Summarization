by @entity0 millions of people gazed up at a moonlit sky last night to witness an incredible astronomical phenomenon			1
with cameras at the ready , sky watchers around the world were treated to the sight of a perigree moon , more commonly known as a supermoon			1
one photographer in @entity11 was able to capture not only the stunning lunar surface , but also a mysterious - looking dark object as it floated by			1
photographer and co-founder of group travel company @entity14 took these pictures of the moon around 11.30pm bst on sunday night and was amazed to see a black object ( ringed in red ) flying from the right side to the left of the moon @entity24 , photographer for group travel company @entity14 , took these pictures of the supermoon around 11.30pm bst last night			1
‘ i captured the image from my back garden in @entity31 using an 800ml @entity33 lens , ’ mr @entity24 told @entity28			2
‘ at first i thought it was an aircraft as it was moving from right to left at the same sort of speed you ’d expect from a plane			0
' mr @entity24 added that he believes it may be some sort of satellite shown up by an unusually bright moon			2
what is this mysterious object ? @entity46 , an astronomer at @entity47 , said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the @entity51			0
but he added , that if the image was from @entity11 , then it is unlikely it is the @entity51 the mysterious object travelled from the right to the left hand side of the moon			1
mr @entity24 added that he believe it may be some sort of satellite illuminated by the unusually bright moon the supermoon is not the technical term for the full moon			1
astronomers call this phenomenon a ' perigee moon , ' which describes the full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to @entity70 each year			1
@entity71 marks the closest point of a body as it orbits around @entity70 , while apogee marks the farthest point from @entity70			1
however , dr @entity76 , a reader in @entity77 at @entity78 claims the most likely explanation for the shadow is the @entity51			0
' the shape is slightly strange , however , there could be something docked to it at the moment , ' he said			0
astronomy and physics writer , @entity46 , said at first sight it is plausible the dark object is the @entity51			0
but , he added , that if the image was taken from @entity11 , then it is unlikely it is the @entity51 ‘ looking up @entity51 visibility for the @entity94 in july shows that it does n't make an appearance above @entity11 until the 19th , ’ he said			2
he added the most logical explanation is that it is a satellite , which often pass in front of the moon			2
the supermoon rises over houses in @entity102 , in the southern @entity104 province of @entity105 looming lunar : the supermoon captured over @entity108 in the @entity110 @entity109 glorious : the moon over the @entity113 in @entity114 a supermoon occurs when the moon is 30,000 miles closer to @entity70 than the farthest point in its orbit making it look bigger and brighter than usual			1
in fact , it is just an optical illusion caused by its position in the sky			1
it is not that uncommon			0
last year we had three although only one made the news			0
this year we will also have three supermoons with the next occurring on august 10 and then on september 9			1
it is the one in august that moon fans are really looking forward to with glee and anticipation			2
the moon will be 863 miles closer than last night ’s			1
@entity135 at the @entity136 said : ‘ i guarantee that some folks will think it 's the biggest moon they 've ever seen if they catch it rising over a distant horizon , because the media will have told them to pay attention to this particular one			0

right , a young girl plays on the sand at @entity151 in the town of @entity153 , @entity154 a supermoon , is seen on the top of a traditional @entity158 lantern that decorated downtown of @entity160 , @entity161			0
@entity158 began on june 29 and ends on july 28 when @entity162 celebrate @entity163 the waxing gibbous moon is viewed from @entity165 , @entity166			0
the supermoon happens when the moon is 30,000 miles closer to @entity70 than the farthest point in its orbit the ‘ @entity178 ’ is probably what will make people remember this coming set of full moons , more than the actual view of the @entity177 itself , he said			1
the illusion occurs when the moon is near the horizon			2
for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists , low - hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees , buildings and other foreground objects			0
when the moon illusion amplifies a perigee moon , the swollen orb rising in the east at sunset can seem super indeed			0
' there 's a part of me that wishes that this ' @entity198 ' moniker would just dry up and blow away , like the ' @entity199 ' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse , because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis - information , ' admits dr @entity135			2
' however , if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy , then it 's a good thing			0

@entity198 happens when the moon is 30,000 miles closer to @entity70 than the farthest point in its orbit
@entity11 photographer captured image of a mystery shadow travelling across the lunar surface last night
astronomers believe it could be an orbiting satellite but are unable to say for certain what it is
a supermoon is an optical illusion caused by its position in the sky and occurs three times this year
there will also be another ' supermoon ' on august 10 and a third *eagerly* anticipated show on september 9
