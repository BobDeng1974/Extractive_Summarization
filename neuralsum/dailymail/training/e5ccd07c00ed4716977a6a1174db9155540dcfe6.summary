by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 20 march 2012 updated : 09:31 est , 20 march 2012 @entity3 mps will today call for an investigation into the case of young men under the age of 21 allegedly castrated in the 1950s by the @entity8 ' to get rid of homosexuality			1
' the government will come under pressure to probe what some claim is a cover - up of a scandal which saw boys ' testicles removed if they dared report abuse by the clergy			1
mps will raise the issue after a @entity3 newspaper revealed details of the punishments - which had not been exposed by an official investigation into sexual abuse within the church published last year			1
the @entity28 , a daily evening paper in the @entity3 , identified a man called @entity31 , as one of the young men who were castrated as well as nine other minors			1
revealed : the @entity28 , a daily evening newspaper in the @entity3 , newspaper identified a man @entity31 as one of the young men who were castrated as well as nine other minors after reporting two monks to the police for abusing him in a catholic boarding home , he was surgically castrated in 1956 , when he was still a minor			1
@entity44 , 79 , a well - known @entity3 sculptor who knew mr @entity31 witnessed the phyiscal evidence of the castration			2
' we once asked @entity31 to drop his pants when the women were gone			0
it was a huge shock , ' he said reported @entity52			0
there are also allegations that @entity55 , who was a @entity3 prime minister had links to the case			1
in 1956 , he was the chairman of the @entity60 children 's home where mr @entity31 and other children were abused @entity62 , an investigative journalist who investigated the @entity31 case , says sources told him that the surgical removal of testicles was regarded as a treatment for homosexuality and also as a punishment for those who accused clergy of sexual abuse			1
mr @entity31 was castrated at the age of 20 - in 1956 he had accused @entity75 clergy of sexually abusing him in his church run care home			2
children in institutional care , regardless of religious affiliation , in the @entity3 were at substantial risk of being abused during the period , the molestation rate was 20 per cent , twice that of elsewhere			2
although the monks were convicted of the abuses , mr @entity31 was still transported to a @entity75 psychiatric hospital , and underwent a surgical castration			2
court papers confirm he was castrated ' at his own request ' , but there is not a submission of his written consent			0
mr @entity31 died two years after the castration in a car crash , but mr @entity44 felt compelled to report the castration to an official inquiry into abuse within the @entity8			2
the investigation headed by @entity100 , a former @entity3 minister , received 1,800 reports of sexual abuse by clergy or volunteers within @entity3 @entity75 dioceses in the period since 1945			1
horrifying : @entity107 , a former boarding school in the @entity3 , where mr @entity31 suffered the abuse in the 1950s the @entity100 inquiry received mr @entity44 's report , but said ' there were few leads for further research , ' so decided not to investigate			1
the inquiry revealed that eight hundred @entity75 clergy and church employees were guilty of abusing children over 40 years			2
the newspaper investigation also revealed that government inspectors were aware that young men were being castrated while in @entity75 - run psychiatric institutions			0
minutes of meetings held in the 1950s show that inspectors were present when castrations were discussed and that the @entity75 staff did not think parents needed to be involved , even if the patients were minors			0
there are also allegations that @entity55 , who was a @entity3 prime minister from 1963 - 65 , had links to the case			1
not only was he a rising star in his political party , he was also vice-chairman of the @entity3 @entity75 child protection agency ,			2
most importantly , in 1956 , he was the chairman of the @entity60 children 's home where mr @entity31 and other children were abused			0
he intervened to have prison sentences dropped against several priests convicted of abusing children			0
the commission said it did not report on the actions of @entity55 because ' the case was unmistakeably tied to circumstances which could be traced back to an individual person			1
' speaking of his findings mr @entity62 said the cases could ' no longer be traced			0
' ' there will be many more			0
but the question is whether those boys , now old men , will want to tell their story , ' he added			0
today @entity3 mps are going to call for a parliamentary investigation into the allegations			1
' i am shocked that boys were being castrated in the 1950s , ' said @entity162 , a @entity163 mp			0
' i want an independent investigation			0
we must find out how many cases there were , who knew about it and why the government did not act			0

surgical removal of testicles was also a punishment for those who accused clergy of sexual abuse
there are also allegations that @entity55 , former @entity3 *pm* had links to the case
@entity3 mps will today call for a parliamentary investigation into the allegations
