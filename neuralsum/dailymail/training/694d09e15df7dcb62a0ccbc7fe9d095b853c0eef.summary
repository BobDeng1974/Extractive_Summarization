in your social circles , there will likely be friends you love spending time with , those who calm you down , and others that you know are a bad influence			2
and now an app can reveal exactly how these different people make you feel , including which friends you should cut out of your life for good			0
called pplkpr , pronounced ' people keeper ' , it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track and log subtle changes in emotional state when you ’re around these people			1
when the monitor spots a change in heart rate , the app alerts the user			1
it asks the wearer to explain how they 're feeling and who they 're with , and over time , an algorithm learns the difference between the varying heart rates and in doing so , it can even tell you which friends could be damaging your health			1
the free @entity43 app was created by @entity45 - based artists @entity46 and @entity47 , and was recently tested on a group of students at @entity50			0
@entity52 pairs up with any @entity22 - enabled heart rate monitor , although the students were given @entity56 devices during the test			1
from this list , the free @entity43 app ranks friendships based on different emotions ( left )			0
the app can then reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress , it can block people who make the wearer anxious ( right ) , or send text messages to people who make the wearer happy or calm using gps , the app also notifies wearers when they change locations , to ask if they ’ve just left , or are about to meet someone			1
the measurements are based on a metric called ‘ heart rate variability ’ ( example pictured ) , where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state			2
this is fed into an algorithm called pplkpr , or @entity87 , it syncs with a heart rate monitor to track subtle changes in emotional state			1
@entity91 notifies the wearer when it detects heightened emotion , and asks them to report how they ’re feeling			0
using gps , it also notifies them when they change locations , to ask if they ’ve just left , or are about to meet someone			0
the measurements are based on a metric called ‘ heart rate variability ’ , where subtle changes in heart rhythm signal changes in an emotional state			2
@entity91 knows when the wearer is experiencing a strong emotion , but lets them decide what that emotion is			0
once established , pplkpr can write text messages , invite people to hang out , or block or delete contacts			1
all of these actions are shown on the home screen before they take place			0
it tracks and logs changes in heart rate and , when it notices a shift , asks the user to explain how they ’re feeling , where they are and who they ’re with			1
over time , an algorithm built into the app can then learn which emotions the subtle changes in heart rate relate to			1
from this list , the app tracks which people make the wearer happy , who calms them down , and the people who cause the most fear or stress			2
this has a number of benefits , according to the developers			0
it can reveal which friends should be avoided during times of stress , for example			0
it can also block or unfriend people who make the wearer anxious or bored , or will message those who make them happy , or calm			0
‘ @entity52 uses gps and a heart rate wristband to keep track of when you 're coming and going , and when you 're feeling emotional , ’ said the developers			1
‘ [ it ] implements a complex metric called “ heart rate variability " that uses subtle changes in heart rhythm to determine your emotional state			2
' this data is correlated with the people you interact with to determine who should be auto - scheduled into your life and who should be removed			0
’ ms @entity47 and mr @entity179 came up with the app to explore quantified living in relationships , and how people interact			0
and for people who do n’t have a heart rate monitor , the app also lets them add manual emotional readings .			1

the pplkpr app syncs with a @entity22 heart rate monitor to track emotions
when the monitor spots a change in heart rate the app alerts the user
it asks the user to explain how they 're feeling , such as happy or *scared*
over time , an algorithm learns the difference between different heart rates
it then identifies people who cause stress , or who are a calming influence
the app can even delete contacts it considers to be bad for the wearer
