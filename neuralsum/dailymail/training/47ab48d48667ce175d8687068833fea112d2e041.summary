he took action because information gained by @entity127 and @entity22 intelligence agents in the city of @entity129 over the past week helped them establish that the risk to @entity25 and her fellow hostages was increasing			0
senior military and intelligence officials attended @entity122 meetings with @entity127 chief sir @entity136 every day last week as information about the kidnapping flowed in through @entity139 , the government ’s secret communications centre			0
it was during the @entity122 meetings that the ‘ nuts and bolts ’ of the rescue plan were put together , and the @entity148 team was placed on stand - by to deploy once a signal was sent from @entity123			2
mr @entity15 attended three of the @entity122 meetings			2

weighed down with bullet - proof vests , weapons and heavy backpacks , the @entity148 troops then faced a gruelling trek of at least five miles across rough , forest - covered terrain before launching their attack			2
they had to land several miles away from their target because the heavily wooded terrain in the area made it difficult for the helicopters to touch down			0
it was also crucial that the gang did not hear the sound of the engines and rotor blades			0
relieved : @entity15 gave the go - ahead for this morning 's rescue of @entity190 , who had been working for a @entity58 - based aid organisation kidnappers ' lair : aid worker @entity0 was held in a cave - dwelling complex the @entity10 troops were used to provide a security cordon around the area of cave dwellings where @entity25 and her colleagues were being held			1

i pay tribute to their skill and dedication			0
’ speaking outside no 10 @entity258 , the prime minister said the rescue should serve as a warning to terrorists across the world who targeted @entity1 citizens			0
‘ they should know if they take @entity1 citizens as hostage we do not pay ransoms , we do not trade prisoners			0
they can expect a swift and brutal end			0
’ mr @entity15 said decisions on rescue attempts were ‘ extraordinarily difficult ’ and ‘ never rushed into ’			1
but he said he decided the risks to the hostages lives were becoming too great			0
mr @entity15 added that he had spoken to @entity25 and to her parents and brother			2
‘ they are incredibly relieved about what has happened , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s just a huge joy that they are finally going to be reunited and they are all healthy and all well			0

spokesman @entity326 said that since the kidnapping , the charity had steered clear of publicity about the situation because it felt that might jeopardise efforts to secure a release			0

we are immensely grateful to all parties involved in ensuring their swift and safe return , ’ mr @entity326 said			0
@entity336 : the hostages were held in a mountainous region close to the border with @entity116 the success of yesterday ’s rescue comes in the wake of a number of tragedies involving aid staff helping the @entity10 people			1
in august 2010 , @entity1 doctor @entity347 was shot dead in an ambush in @entity12 as she delivered medical supplies			1
the @entity55 claimed they killed the 36 - year - old aid worker for ‘ preaching @entity352			1
’ but @entity10 authorities said her killers were more likely to have been bandits , as they stole dr @entity358 ’s belongings and passport along with those of her seven colleagues			2
two months later , @entity1 aid worker @entity362 died during a failed mission to rescue her from kidnappers in @entity10			1
ms @entity362 , 36 , was killed by a grenade thrown by a @entity22 soldier during the operation , although at her inquest @entity370 coroner @entity369 did not blame him or his comrades for the tragic mistake			0
three afghans captured with her were released unharmed a few days later			0
in @entity377 in march building contractor @entity375 was killed with an @entity379 colleague as @entity377 troops and @entity382 commandos launched a rescue mission			1
