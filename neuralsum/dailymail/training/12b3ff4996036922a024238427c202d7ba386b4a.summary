@entity0 continued their recent resurgence with a fourth straight win at home to a stuttering @entity5 side			1
striker @entity6 pounced after @entity8 's mistake to secure the three points after 73 minutes			1
here , @entity11 's @entity10 gives his verdict on how the players performed at @entity14			2
@entity23 - 7.5 strong in the tackle – upending @entity25 at the cost of a booking – but was purposeful in attack as well , although he was lucky to avoid second yellow			2
@entity30 - 7 a picture of coolness and composure yet again			2
@entity34 is in fine form right now			0
@entity36 - 7.5 no - nonsense defending throughout and kept @entity25 out of the game			0
three wins from three since he came into side			0
@entity40 challenges @entity42 @entity41 for possession during the clash at @entity14 @entity45 - 7 kept @entity46 quiet and for that he must be applauded			1
@entity40 - 6.5 nervy at times on @entity50 debut but kept things ticking over in middle of park			1
@entity54 - 6.5 tidy if unspectacular but got through a lot of work			0
@entity16 - 8.5 menacing runs from deep asked questions of @entity60 and it was he who had major say in winning goal			0
immense from first minute to last			0
a man of the match performance @entity66 international @entity16 , holding off @entity46 , was a constant threat on saturday @entity68 ( off 27 ' ) - 6 was causing problems for @entity8 before thigh injury cut short his involvement			1
@entity72 ( off 46 ' ) - 5.5 one chance which was cleared from line but did not look as sharp as he did before the knee injury which has troubled him the past fortnight			0
@entity68 pulls up whilst on another speedy break and had to go off injured in the first - half @entity80 ( off 66 ' ) - 6 got at @entity81 early on but faded and became sloppy as the game wore on			1
substitutes : @entity84 ( on 27 ) - 6 the intent was there but the execution not after first - half introduction			1
promising @entity0 junior @entity84 manages to keep the ball from @entity90 and @entity91 @entity92 ( on 66 ' ) - 6.5 could have scored his first goal for club but was denied by @entity95			2
was busy after arrival midway through second half			0
@entity6 ( on 46 ' ) - 7 @entity0 ’s match - winner for the second week in a row and is fast becoming a favourite in these parts			1
@entity5 : ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity5 keeper @entity95 made some impressive saves but could n't keep out @entity6 's strike @entity95 - 5 flapped at crosses and did not command his area			1
@entity81 - 5.5 was troubled by @entity80 early on but saved his side with goal - line block before half - time			2
@entity109 - 6 a couple of shaky moments but was strong apart and perhaps should have scored with first - half header			1
@entity113 - 5.5 did n’t have a great deal to do in fairness but @entity15 was n’t pleased with some of his distribution			0
@entity8 - 5 his error proved costly when dithering to allow @entity6 to score			1
@entity5 full back up against @entity68 was at fault for the decisive goal in the second - half against @entity0 @entity121 - 5.5 failed to impact and barely got a kick first - half			1
did n’t fare much better after break			0
@entity90 - 6 tidy enough but nothing telling from the skipper and raking passes came to precious little			0
former @entity129 captain @entity90 could n't prevent his @entity5 side losing at @entity14 @entity91 ( off 66 ' ) - 5 passed the ball efficiently without ever penetrating @entity0 ’s backline			1
@entity41 ( off 80 ' ) - 6 looked @entity5 ’s best bet of conjuring something in final third			2
@entity25 - 5.5 anonymous first half , although he was too isolated			2
came into game after break but still not enough from the @entity139			0
mercurial striker @entity25 was closely marked at @entity0 and was isolated for large parts of the game @entity46 - 5 a subdued afternoon and he ’ll be disappointed with this performance			1
substitutes : @entity146 ( on 66 ' ) - 6 almost made immediate impact with shot which fizzed wide			0
@entity149 ( on 80 ' )			0

subdued first - half with few chances for either side at @entity14
@entity6 scores as @entity8 fails to clear after 73 minutes
@entity0 have won their last four matches on the spin
@entity5 have now lost four times in the @entity50 this *season*
