@entity3 roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver , spins the cylinder , places the muzzle against his head , and pulls the trigger			0
with a six - shooter revolver , players have in theory a one - in - six chance of blowing their brains out ; but in practice the force of gravity will probably make the full chamber come to rest at the bottom of the cylinder , altering the odds in favour of the player			0
the term ' russian roulette ' first appeared in a story of the same name by @entity52 , which describes @entity3 officers playing it in @entity56 in 1917 , although it is claimed the game had been widely known in @entity3 since the early 19th century			0
@entity59 pictures : mr @entity18 had taken a @entity6 revolver and gone to visit a friend in @entity8 , a city in the western @entity10 province of @entity11 , where he proposed playing the lethal game mr @entity18 's death came as the @entity68 's chief of police , colonel @entity67 , warned of the danger of having guns in homes precisely because they could fall into the hands of the young and reckless			1
days before mr @entity18 's death he had launched a firearms amnesty in the city , asking any citizens with firearms to ' surrender your weapon ' anonymously and with no legal repercussions			1
since mr @entity18 's death it has emerged that the revolver he used was stolen from a neighbour , who was registered to own it			1
a police spokesman said they are looking into the matter .			2
