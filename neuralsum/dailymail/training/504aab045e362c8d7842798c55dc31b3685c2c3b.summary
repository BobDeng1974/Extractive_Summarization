by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 19 july 2012 updated : 14:16 est , 19 july 2012 beachgoers in @entity2 have been left mystified after millions of tiny purple creatures , curled up in balls , appeared on the shoreline			2
the identity of the strange , pea - sized animals - littered along the beaches of @entity9 , @entity10 - has also perplexed marine biologists , who have never seen anything like it			1
most of the crabs , which washed up in the surf over the past few days , were dead or dying			2
@entity38 , a biologist at the aquarium , said : ' what you are seeing is a swimming stage , probably a few more molts before they settle into their crab stage self			2
' researchers are said to be studying those which are still alive to try to find out what they will grow to become			0
the 7 - 11 crab ( above ) is so named because when first seen in the water , it has seven spots but closer inspection reveals a further four on its underbelly			1
also known as the spotted reef crab , it can grow up to 7inches long			2
they live in the tidepool reef - and according to legend , the spots are the results of a fight with a sea god			0
while the tiny crabs that washed up were purple , the 7 - 11 has a rusty orange shell - although its spots are maroon			1
it generally feeds at night on other crustaceans and invertebrates and hides during the day			0
the little crabs are less than an inch long and , if they are 7 - 11 crabs , they will eventually grow to around six or seven inches			1
' the lifeguard called and asked what these things were because she had reports that surfers were actually having these things crawl up on their boards and onto them , ' mr @entity38 added			0
meanwhile , one resident told @entity81 news : ' it 's really weird			0
' it looks like you want to eat it like a berry			2
' another said : ' when something washes up like this , you do n't know what to expect - maybe tsunami stuff			0
' the coastline affected stretches from @entity95 to @entity96 on the southern tip of @entity10			1
dr @entity98 , director of the @entity30 , reckoned that the crabs were washed up after rough seas left air bubbles in their shells , leaving them unable to dive			1
as a result of this , they get caught up in tides and come ashore			0
' it could be a flux of warm or cold water coming in but i do n't have any signs of that , ' dr @entity98 told @entity115			0
he added : ' and if it was pollution , it would have affected other species as well , so we really do n't know [ why this is happening ]			0
' dr @entity98 , director of the @entity30 , reckoned that the crabs were washed up after rough seas left air bubbles in their shells , leaving them unable to dive one local said : ' it 's really weird			1
it looks like you want to eat it like a berry ' experts at @entity30 said they had never seen an event like this before			1

' it looks like you want to eat it , like a berry , ' said one local
creatures could be larval stage of 7 - 11 crab , according to scientists
experts have never seen an event like this before
@entity148 affected from @entity96 to @entity95 in @entity10
crabs may have got air bubbles in their shells during rough seas and were unable to dive
