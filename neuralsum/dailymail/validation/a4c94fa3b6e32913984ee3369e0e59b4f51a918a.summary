@entity1 midfielder @entity0 ( right ) believes his side can cause an upset against @entity3 @entity0 chases @entity22 defender @entity21 ( right ) during the @entity5 game at @entity24 midfielder @entity0 said : ' it was quite evident the mentality we 've got in the squad and obviously coming from two goals down at a stadium like that , backs to the wall , and getting a point , we can take a lot of heart from that			1
' we know it 's going to be difficult			2
we 're not in a fairyland where we think it 's going to be easy , but we know what we 've got in the dressing room			0
we know we 're going to work for each other and technically and ability-wise we 've got that as well			0
' last time at half - time we knew one goal could change it , and it did , and we had chances to win it as well			2
first half they were superb and we knew if they got the next goal it was going to be very difficult for us			0
' but you get a goal and , no matter who you 're playing against , it 's going to take its toll			0
we started getting control of the ball and passing it about and then @entity60 turned up with a wonderful finish			0
' @entity1 followed up the point against @entity3 by claiming a draw at @entity64 and then beating @entity65 but since then times have been tougher			1

' when you 're playing against your cities , @entity90 , @entity91 , they 're the games you look forward to at the start of the fixture list , the ones you want to play in			0
' every game 's enjoyable in this division but when you 're playing the big boys you want to get on the ball and show what you can do			0
' @entity1 's fate is likely to be decided by their home form , and @entity0 knows they can not afford more of the slips that saw them fail to turn leads against @entity108 and @entity109 into wins			1
' it 's massive , ' said the @entity112			0
' with the fans behind us , last season it was a fortress at times , people did n't want to come and play against us at home			2

the fans have been different class and we need to get more points			0
