the girl is currently flying home from @entity9 , and is expected to arrive at @entity10 around 8.30pm			2
she was discovered after police issued a photofit image of her showing what she could look like today			1
six - year - old @entity4 , is finally home more than three years after she was abducted by her father and taken to @entity3 a computer generated image of how @entity4 could look now , which is said to have helped in finding her @entity17 , 32 , said she been through an ' absolute nightmare ' and ' three years of trauma ' as the search for her daughter continued			1
but earlier this week @entity4 was taken into protective custody after apparently being found living with relatives of her father in @entity3			1
it is thought she was traced after police published a computer - generated image of what she would like now - a day before her sixth birthday in november			1
the @entity29 has reported that @entity3 authorities were involved in tracking @entity4 down , and that she was discovered in @entity31			1
a @entity33 spokesperson confirmed the youngster would be returning to the @entity35 later today			2
detective superintendent @entity36 said : ' this has been a long and hard investigation which has thankfully culminated in @entity4 being on her way home			1
' throughout the three years of her disappearance , her mother @entity41 has understandably been sick with worry			2
she had not heard from her beloved daughter and did not know whether she would ever set eyes upon her again			0
' however , @entity41 , alongside ourselves and a variety of organisations , were determined we would not give up and remained dedicated to finding her			0
thanks to this determination and the help from the @entity3 authorities , we have the outcome we were hoping for			2
' separated : @entity5 , left , and ms @entity4 , right , had an ' on - off ' relationship split - up before @entity4 was born @entity17 weeping as she earlier made an appeal for information about her missing daughter @entity58 @entity57 said : ' i was delighted to be able to assist @entity33 to bring this case to a satisfactory fruition			1
two @entity33 officers have provided continued support for this case for over three years but the real credit goes to @entity4 's mum , @entity41 , who never gave up			1
' i am also very grateful to the @entity3 authorities who did the work on the ground to locate @entity4			1
' her father , a former insurance salesman , took his daughter to @entity31 on her third birthday , and told @entity41 that she was ' never going to see @entity4 again '			1
@entity5 is currently serving a prison sentence in the @entity35 for refusing to reveal his daughter 's whereabouts despite a court order			1
he was first jailed in june 2010 , and in april this year a high court judge handed him a fourth consecutive sentence after he continued to insist he did not know where @entity4 was			1
mr @entity82 imposed a 12 - month prison term after he found him in contempt of a @entity79 order instructing him to disclose @entity4 's whereabouts			1
he said @entity5 , 28 , would not be eligible for release until he had served at least six months			2
judges have previously imposed jail terms of two years , 12 months and another 12 months in the hope that @entity5 would provide information			1
they have re-jailed him as each sentence neared its end			2
ms @entity4 , a former charity worker , took legal action in an attempt to force @entity96 to reveal the crucial details			1
@entity5 , who represented himself at the latest court hearing , indicated that @entity4 was in @entity3 or @entity99 but said he did not know her exact whereabouts			1
2003 : @entity17 and @entity101 meet while studying at @entity102 and start on - off relationship november 7 , 2006 : their daughter @entity4 was born 2008 : ms @entity4 ended her relationship with @entity5 after he became overly possessive november 7 , 2009 : @entity4 went missing on her birthday after her father said he was taking her on a trip to @entity6 november 16 , 2009 : @entity4 was supposed to share a flight back from @entity3 with her grandmother but the woman returned alone november 20 , 2009 : @entity5 arrested after returning to the @entity35 without his daughter and refusing to reveal her whereabouts june 2010 : @entity5 jailed after refusing to comply with a court order compelling him to reveal @entity4 's location november 6 , 2012 : ms @entity4 made an emotional appeal for @entity4 's return and a photograph of what she looks like now was published december 2012 : @entity4 found living with relatives in a village in @entity3 december 28 , 2012 : @entity4 is due to be returned home to her mother mr @entity82 said he was sure @entity5 was lying			1
the judge said : ' i am certain that he is in contempt			0
it is absolutely absurd for him to suggest that he does not know the whereabouts of his daughter and he can not contact her			0
i am certain he is lying			0
' another judge previously said the case was ' as bad a case of child abduction as i have encountered '			0
just last month ms @entity4 , from @entity135 , @entity136 , launched a fresh appeal for information on her daughter 's whereabouts			1
she said : ' it 's been an absolute nightmare			0
as to her whereabouts we know nothing			0
we 've had no contact			0
i 'm worrying every day , every single day			0
everything is affected by it			0
when i close my eyes i see her			0
' i say goodnight to her every night before bed			0
i pray she ’s okay but we do n’t have any proof that she ’s okay and no proof she is even still alive , ' she said			0
' it ’s been discussed that she could have been sold , but i do n’t want to believe it			0
' as far as i ’m aware she has n’t been with any family member so i can only assume she ’s with strangers			0
' to know that she ’s safe , to know that she ’s being looked after , to know where she is			0
a child does n’t disappear , does n’t evaporate			0
a child is put somewhere and people know - and that information needs to be talked about			2
' she was so funny			0
she was a little bundle of joy			0
she loved her lip gloss and handbags - as soon as she got hold of my make - up bag , everything in it was hers			2
we just want her home			0
' ms @entity4 met @entity5 in 2003 while they were studying the same course at @entity102 , and @entity4 was born on november 7 , 2006			1
but the couple ended their on - off relationship in 2008 after @entity5 apparently became controlling and possessive - and when ms @entity4 broke off the affair , her ex swore revenge			1
during a visit on the youngster ’s birthday he said he was taking @entity193 to @entity6 but instead , he took her to @entity31 where he claimed she was staying for a week with relatives			1
torment : @entity4 's mother described the horror of being without her little girl for three years @entity4 was supposed to share a flight with her grandmother on november 16 , but the grandmother came back alone			1
@entity5 himself returned to the @entity35 on november 20 without his daughter and he was subsequently arrested			2
he claimed he handed @entity4 to a mystery man called @entity205 who took her to @entity99 , but the supposed middleman could not be tracked down after the address @entity5 gave for him proved to be false			1
@entity41 said at the time : ' he 's not prepared to back down - he 's not prepared to work with the police			2
' he 's enjoying playing his controlling mind games			0
' @entity5 is refusing to say where she is , who she 's with and he wo n't say anything other than " she 's in @entity99 "			1
' originally she was in @entity3			2
he wo n't give the actual location of where she is			2
' he 's doing this because he has control over me			0
he knew the relationship was non-existent			0
' while @entity4 is not the only @entity35 child to have been abducted by a family member and held in @entity225 or the @entity226			2
@entity227 , top right , was twice kidnapped by her father and is currently being held in an @entity231 village - even though her mother @entity232 was awarded custody by local courts			0
@entity235 , bottom right , was kidnapped by his uncle aged 10 and forced to live with family members he did not know in @entity239			0
the number of parental child abduction cases handled by @entity35 officials has risen by 88 per cent over the past decade , according to figures released earlier this month			0
and if the children are taken to a country such as @entity3 which has not signed up to the @entity247 on protecting children , there could be no legal way to return them to @entity35 .			2
