if you ever wanted proof that pre-season form should not be taken too seriously , the 24 hours between @entity1 ’s spectacular win and uninspiring defeat at the @entity3 had it			1
fielding a side far from their best starting @entity8 , @entity1 tore apart @entity10 champions @entity9 5 - 1 on saturday afternoon , suggesting @entity12 ’s side could finally rid themselves of any squad depth concerns			1
then , a tame 1 - 0 defeat to @entity15 on sunday brought the @entity16 right back down to earth , despite @entity12 selecting first team stars			1
of course , the players wo n’t take it to heart			0
pre-season has one priority ; fitness			2
both have won all their pre-season games so far , despite a new leader and a desperate need for rebuilding at both clubs			2
typically , the @entity50 champions rarely lose more than two of their pre-season games , but in recent years the @entity53 clubs have not always shown a sign of things to come in the summer months			1
last season , @entity31 lost four of their eight pre-season fixtures , overcome by @entity58 , @entity1 , and @entity61 outfits @entity59 and @entity62			1
@entity64 ’s side went on to take the league title by two points			0
similarly , in 2010 , neighbours @entity41 lost three of their seven warm - ups , against @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
sir @entity71 did n't mind too much , and they wrapped up their 19th title with a game to spare			2
tackle : @entity76 and @entity77 compete for the ball in the @entity79 @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 @entity86 , @entity81 , @entity87 @entity88 , @entity81 , @entity89 @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity85 @entity92 , @entity84 , @entity87 @entity93 , @entity91 , @entity94 @entity95 , @entity81 , @entity94 @entity96 , @entity91 , @entity87 @entity97 , @entity91 , @entity85 @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity85 likewise , @entity41 ’s treble season in 1998 - 99 started with defeats at @entity102 and @entity103			1
as you ’d expect , @entity71 did n't take the defeats to heart			0
there ’s also a warning sign for the fans of relegation candidates			0
saints , torn apart by the departure of @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , have ignored talks of a crisis under @entity119 and performed on the pitch , while newly promoted @entity121 are unbeaten in their four pre-season games with three wins			2
encouraging ? do n’t read too much into it			0
in recent years , summer promise has more often than not led to tears come may			2
@entity127 lost just once in pre-season last term but failed to avoid the drop , while @entity131 were unbeaten in their seven warm - up matches in 2012 before going down			1
in 2011 - 12 , the relegated teams enjoyed fine pre-season form - @entity134 won six of their eight games , while @entity138 and @entity139 each lost just one of their six fixtures			1
all three went through the trap door and have failed to emerge since			0
pairs : @entity144 and @entity145 battle for the ball while flanked by @entity149 ad @entity147 fresh from signing the likes of @entity152 and @entity153 in the summer of 2010 , @entity150 won six of their seven , beating @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			2
sadly , it took them until late february to even win six @entity50 games			2
you guessed it , @entity164 ’s side went down , alongside @entity165 ’s @entity102 , who lost only one of seven in pre-season			1
shock friendly results can also be misleading			0
you ’ll struggle to find a @entity171 fan left unaffected by the 6 - 1 defeat to @entity173 just two months after dropping out of the @entity50 in 2009			0
despite @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 all playing , spirit seemed at an all - time low			0
they went on to lose just four games in the @entity182 , and won the division with 102 points under @entity185			0
defeat : @entity96 suffered defeat at the hands of @entity189 , @entity186 blamed it on the referee @entity96 need games - @entity186 jump : @entity192 heads the ball as @entity33 took on @entity194 in a friendly tournament in @entity196 players , too , can show promise in july and flop when points are on the line			1
@entity203 ’s @entity202 forward @entity201 scored seven goals , including two hat - tricks , before the 2003 - 04 season , but went on to score just one more in 15 games			1
similarly , in 2004 , @entity208 took his goalscoring form from @entity210 to @entity96 for pre-season , scoring four in three games , but only managed another four in the @entity50 before leaving for @entity213			1
@entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity147 will hope to take their impressive pre-season form into the competitive season after struggling in the @entity50 last term			1
of course , weak squads , fitness and motivational levels must all be taken into account			0
no matter how many sponsored international super friendly tournaments are created , the thrill of competitive action is difficult to replicate			0
pre-season does serve a purpose for fans			0
it is a time for optimism , a period where all fans get gee themselves up for the new campaign and dream of what is to come			0
but do n’t take it too seriously			0
when there are points on the line , everything changes			0
@entity96 @entity33 v @entity31 highlights			1

@entity1 lost to @entity15 *yesterday* , and so did not win the @entity37
@entity96 lost 3 - 0 to @entity189 in their last game
but pre-season form bears no real *correlation* to the season ahead
@entity31 lost four out of eight friendlies last summer
@entity41 lost to @entity103 and @entity102 before winning treble
