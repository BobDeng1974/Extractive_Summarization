by @entity0 @entity2 the condom dress was made by @entity4 youngsters it looks like something @entity7 might wear			1
the neon coloured crazy latex creation made from 300 condoms was created 6 months ago and is now touring the shores of @entity12			1
it was originally created by @entity15 artist @entity14 who creates dresses from expired or defective condoms to promote safe sex amongst youngsters			2
now the blueprint is being used in @entity12 and neighbourhood groups are making their very own @entity2 the condom dresses			1
this is the fifth time a @entity2 frock has been created by a group of youngsters			1
not everyone is in favour of the dress with @entity31 councillor @entity30 and mayor @entity32 clashing over the issue			2
mr @entity30 told @entity34 he did not like @entity2 being displayed at ' family friendly venues '			2
' they ( children ) are already bombarded with sexualisation every day and it just creates confusion , ' he said			2
' there is also no evidence the dress raises sexual health awareness among young people			0
' but mayor @entity32 hit back at the negative comments telling @entity34 she was ' pleased that it is back ' even though @entity2 ' does create differences of opinion '			1
' we have high sti rates and anything we can do to draw attention to that is a good thing , ' she said			0
' i am well aware how difficult it is for adults to talk to kids about this and at least this is creating the conversation			0
' the latest @entity2 was made by 174 people , aged from just 11 to 24 , at @entity65 on the @entity12 south coast between april and june this year			1
the project took so long because the youngsters could not find a glue that would stick the condoms onto the mannequin			2
mrs @entity76 , 25 , told @entity34 her centre created their first @entity2 in 2011 but the new one was ' much better '			1
she said : ' last time we had quite a positive reaction when she toured in @entity12			2
' we had a number of parents saying they wished their children had learnt about condoms when they were younger , as they had children very young or discovered they had an @entity96 later in life			0
the idea for the dresses came from @entity15 artist @entity14 who runs the @entity101 campaign ' we had one or two negative comments and complaints , but generally @entity2 was received very positively			0
' i think we got chosen a second time because we did a good job			0
' statistics for young people with sexually transmitted diseases is high in @entity110 and something like this gives us the opportunity to we chat to young people and we can tell them happen if you do n't have a condom			0
' at first the kids were saying they were not interested and that 's gross but that 's where the questions start			0
' some will say why is it only the boy that has to use it and if a girl kisses her boyfriend is she going to get pregnant ? ' making @entity2 helps them show that we are open to questions and we have better conversations when they are being creative			0
the aim of the dress is to start conversations in young people about sexually related diseases @entity76 says @entity2 has generally received a positive response in @entity12 ' some youngsters do n't actually think @entity139 are problematic and can be really painful			1
' they do n't realise it can be so serious , but we show them appropriate pictures of things like genital warts to show them what can happen			0
' youth projects all over @entity12 can put together their own proposals to @entity148 and @entity149 ( @entity150 ) for funding to make their very own @entity2			1
the group used expired or defective condoms for the project it took the youth project three months to create @entity2 @entity157 , @entity148 and @entity158 for south eastern @entity159 , which rolls out the project , told @entity34 : ' there has been an increase in chlamydia in recent years and most of the increases have been with young people			1
' @entity2 raises awareness in young people and something like chlamydia is easy to treat and people often do not know they have got it			0
