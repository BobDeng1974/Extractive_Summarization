but it may actually be a sign that @entity19 needs a lot more bomb fuel to back up its nuclear threats			1
despite the bluster , it could be years before @entity11 completes the laborious process of creating more weaponised fuel			1
its announcement , experts say , is also likely an effort to boost fears meant to keep its leadership safe while trying to extract concessions from the @entity34 and its allies			2
@entity11 has declared itself a nuclear power and threatened to expand its atomic arsenal after its third nuclear test in february sparked the recent rise in hostility on the @entity41			1
but that arsenal is estimated to be only a handful of crude devices			0
to assemble a cache of weapons that would make it a true nuclear power , and to back up its threats , @entity11 scientists need more bomb fuel - both for the weapons they hope to build and for the repeated tests required to perfect those weapons			1
' despite its recent threats , @entity11 does not yet have much of a nuclear arsenal because it lacks fissile materials and has limited nuclear testing experience , ' @entity56 , a nuclear scientist who has been regularly granted unusual access to the @entity11 's nuclear facilities , said this week in answers posted to the website of @entity66 's @entity65			1
@entity11 nuclear capabilities are something of a mystery			1
what is known is that it possesses the ability to produce both fuels that can be used to make nuclear bombs - plutonium and uranium			0
this causes serious long - term worries following @entity11 's announcement tuesday that it is ' readjusting and restarting ' all facilities at its main @entity81 nuclear complex , including a plutonium reactor shut down six years ago as part of now - failed nuclear negotiations , and a uranium enrichment plant			1
' what they really want is a safety blanket and a blackmail tool , ' @entity99 , president of the @entity100 think tank in @entity106 , said in an email			0
the announcement ' is primarily political , designed to signal strength and intimidate			0
it should not necessarily be seen as a revelation about @entity11 's capabilities and true intent , ' @entity110 , a senior fellow at the @entity111 in @entity112 , said in an email			2
a reactor at the main @entity81 nuclear complex could eventually make , in one year , enough plutonium to power one bomb			2
examination : @entity34 researchers visited @entity11 in 2008 - researcher @entity56 examines machining lathes that were used for machining uranium metal fuel rods and are now stored in monitored storage locations in the fuel fabrication facility threats : the empty inner structure of a cooling tower at the @entity131 vowed this week to restart a nuclear reactor that can make one bomb 's worth of plutonium a year restarted : in 2008 file photo the cooling tower of the @entity81 nuclear complex is demolished in a sign of its commitment to stop making plutonium for atomic bombs , but now it is being re-started it was shuttered as part of international disarmament talks in 2007 , its cooling tower blown up in a dramatic show of commitment to a now - scrapped nuclear deal			1
@entity11 shocked many when in 2010 it unveiled an industrial - scale uranium enrichment facility , which gives it an alternative route to create bombs			2
estimates on restarting the vital facilities at the plutonium reactor vary from three months to a year , depending on the expert			0
@entity11 has already begun construction at the reactor and it could be back in operation sooner than expected , according to a @entity34 research institute that analyzed recent commercial satellite imagery of @entity81			1
rebuilding the cooling tower would take six months , but a march 27 photo shows building work may have started for an alternative cooling system that could take just weeks , the @entity34 - @entity165 at @entity166 said wednesday			0
@entity11 today announced that it would kick - start its nuclear programme once again by re-opening a complex which was closed as part of disarmament talks six years ago			1
a file handout satellite image shows the @entity81 complex nuclear facility but even if the reactor is now up and running , @entity99 estimates it would be two to three years before scientists could obtain more plutonium for bombs			0
there are other challenges to restarting the reactor			0
@entity11 scientists need to clean , check for any leaks , test components and replace ones that no longer work , according to @entity188 , a nuclear expert at the @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity97			1
a map showing @entity11 missile ranges			2
the @entity194 has announced it is deploying missile defense systems to the @entity34 base in @entity197 and missile defense ships to sea between @entity200 and the rogue nation is @entity11 's missile system a threat ? today @entity97 's defence minister said that @entity11 has moved a missile with ' considerable range ' to its east coast			2
officials said there were no signs the @entity11 planned to test fire their new longer - range @entity212 road - mobile intercontinental ballistic missile			2
the range he described could refer to a mobile @entity11 missile known as the @entity217			2
what is the @entity217 ? the @entity217 , also known as the @entity219 or the @entity217 , is an intermediate - range ballistic missile			0
it has a range of 3,000 kilometres ( 1,800 miles ) - that would make @entity200 and @entity97 potential targets , but little is known about the missile 's accuracy			0
what is the @entity212 ? adm. @entity227 , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , noted this missile could probably hit the @entity34 - it is thought he means @entity229			0
defence secretary @entity230 cited the @entity212 as a justification for the administrationâ € ™ s decision to deploy 14 additional missile interceptors in @entity229			0
the @entity11 military claims it has a range of 10,000 kilometres , but military experts believe that the 18 - metre - long @entity212 has a range of 6,000 kilometres			2
it is a concern as it is road - mobile and easy to hide			0
is the @entity34 strong enough ? @entity11 is n't thought to have nuclear - armed missiles that can hit the @entity34 and is extremely unlikely to launch a direct attack on @entity243 or its @entity34 ally , knowing that military retaliation would threaten the leadership 's survival			1
this week the @entity194 deployed two @entity249 - equipped missile defense ships to operate off the @entity41			0
it is readying long - range ground - based interceptors in @entity229 and @entity252			0
it is also deploying one of its newest ground - based missile defences to the @entity256 about the nuclear power station ? @entity11 's vow to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities raises fears about assembly lines churning out fuel for a fearsome arsenal of nuclear missiles			1
but it may actually be a sign that @entity19 needs a lot more bomb fuel to back up its nuclear threats			1
despite the bluster , it could be years before @entity11 completes the laborious process of creating more weaponized fuel			1
its announcement , experts say , is also likely an effort to boost fears meant to keep its leadership safe while trying to extract concessions from the @entity34 and its allies			0
' nuclear material can be very corrosive			0
cleaning the chemical equipment for reprocessing plutonium can be an overwhelming task , ' @entity188 said			0
@entity11 is n't thought to have nuclear - armed missiles that can hit the @entity34 and is extremely unlikely to launch a direct attack on @entity243 or its @entity34 ally , knowing that military retaliation would threaten the leadership 's survival			1
experts estimate it has enough plutonium for between four to eight crude plutonium - based weapons			0
but @entity11 has yet to show that it has mastered the technology needed to shrink down warheads so they can be placed on missiles , although @entity19 has bragged - as recently as thursday - that it has ' smaller , lighter ' nuclear weapons ready to strike the @entity34 to back up that boast , however , @entity19 needs more tests , which would deplete its limited supply of nuclear fuel			1
this motivation may partially explain the vow to restart @entity81			0
two other larger plutonium reactors had construction halted because of a past nuclear disarmament deal ; @entity56 said the @entity11 claim both are unsalvageable			1
@entity11 is also thought to be making progress on building a small experimental light - water reactor			2
the @entity310 also suggested this week that it was boosting uranium enrichment efforts			0
@entity11 's uranium program worries @entity112 because the centrifuges that enrich the fuel into bomb - grade material are much easier to conceal than bulky plutonium reactors , which produce large amounts of heat that can easily be seen by satellites			1
a crude uranium bomb is also easier to produce than one made with plutonium , and @entity11 has large natural uranium deposits			1
@entity56 was shown 2,000 uranium centrifuges at @entity81 in 2010 , but it 's not clear whether the centrifuges have been reconfigured to make highly enriched uranium			0
it 's also unknown what fuel @entity11 used in its feb. 12 test , its third since 2006 ; a confirmed uranium - based nuclear test would show that @entity11 has centrifuges producing highly enriched uranium			1
@entity11 built its secret uranium program at its main nuclear facility without the knowledge of the @entity34 intelligence community , @entity331 , a former @entity34 intelligence officer and now an analyst at @entity333 think tank in @entity112 , said in an email			1
' as such , we do not know how many covert uranium enrichment sites @entity11 has nor how many uranium weapons they can produce per year			2
' still , scientists ca n't make a uranium bomb overnight			0
even if the @entity11 's 2,000 centrifuges were configured properly and spinning 24 hours a day , every day for a year , they could only make one or two uranium bombs , said @entity347 , a nuclear expert at @entity349			1
the @entity310 's plan to restart the plutonium reactor looked to some like an admission that @entity19 has n't made much progress in its uranium enrichment program			2
' why else would it go to the trouble of a time - consuming and expensive restart to plutonium production at a known and vulnerable facility ? ' @entity110 asked .			0

@entity11 has vowed to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities
raised fears about churning out out a fearsome arsenal of nuclear missiles
could be a sign @entity19 needs a lot more bomb fuel to back up threats
