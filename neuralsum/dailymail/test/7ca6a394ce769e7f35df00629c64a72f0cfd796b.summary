@entity1 boss @entity0 believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals			1
with hopes of retaining the @entity7 crown looking increasingly forlorn , @entity1 have again failed to build on a title success			1
they were hampered last summer , however , with their punishment for breaching the @entity10 regulations of @entity13 governing body @entity12 including a Â£ 49million net spending cap			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 insists his side must splash the cash in the summer @entity0 has said @entity1 must sign a ' crack ' player such as striker @entity19 @entity1 are currently fourth in the @entity7 a return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after @entity24 's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option , for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions , but @entity0 has warned they can not stay idle			1
@entity0 recently spoke of a need to sign a ' crack ' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker @entity19 - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it			1
the @entity36 , whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of monday 's trip to @entity41 , said : ' well , it is just the way of thinking , that big teams need to sign a big player			1
it is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it			0
' i 'm not just talking about @entity1			2
you see @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 - all the big clubs - they all do it			0
it is important to have big names			0
' given the general disappointments of last summer 's principle signings - @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 - @entity0 's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash			1
but when pushed further , @entity0 , perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain , would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned			2
@entity0 still believes his @entity1 side are capable of retaining the @entity72 title he said : ' i do n't want to talk about ( plans ) for next season because we have to finish this season			1
it is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players			2
so it is not the right moment to talk about it			0
' @entity0 's immediate concern is his side 's league position			2
results elsewhere have seen @entity1 drop two places over the weekend and , although @entity0 has not given up on the title , he clearly can not even take the runners - up spot for granted			1
he said : ' well we are not thinking about just one team			0
i think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we ca n't win the @entity7 then we must try to be second			0
' but it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title			0

the @entity36 insists it is important to splash the cash every other season
