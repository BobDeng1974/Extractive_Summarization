taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in the building housing mp ’s offices			1
private discussions have been held about how to cope with the latest - and most expensive - setback at @entity8 , the modernist glass ‘ atrium ’ adjoining @entity10 which opened in 2001			2
it has emerged that @entity13 have approved £ 488,000 for temporary repairs to the damage , almost half of which will be spent on a ‘ feasibility study ’			1
taxpayers will have to fork out a staggering half a million pounds to fix four panes of glass in @entity8 , the modernist glass ‘ atrium ’ adjoining @entity10 which opened in 2001 a permanent solution in the coming years could take the bill way past £ 1million			1
the glass structure houses the offices of some 200 mps and their staff , modern committee rooms and a vast seating area with a canteen , restaurant and meeting area			0
its ’ construction ran to £ 235million after massive over-spending , and the building has been plagued by scandals from persistent cracks in the glass to the £ 400,000 cost of renting 12 decorative fig trees			2
but the most expensive repair to date has been approved this year , after one of the damaged panels of glass crashed to the floor nine months ago , fortunately not injuring anyone			0
it is understood from @entity50 sources that around £ 38,000 was spent on making the pane safe			1
another £ 210,000 is being spent on a temporary replacement for it and three other cracked panes			1
finally , £ 240,000 has been approved for a ‘ feasibility study ’ by construction experts to work out how much a permanent solution to the roof problems will cost			1
the glass structure houses the offices of some 200 mps and their staff , modern committee rooms and a vast seating area with a canteen , restaurant and meeting area during rainy weather last week , large red buckets had to be placed on the floor outside the staff canteen where the panels fell in march			0
@entity72 mp @entity71 , who sits on the @entity73 said : ‘ it is astonishing to find that this problem is going to cost so much to fix			1
‘ a very unwelcome @entity76 present for both the parliamentary authorities and the taxpayer ’			2
@entity80 , of the @entity79 , said : ‘ @entity8 increasingly looks like a black hole for hard - pressed taxpayers ’ cash			2
‘ at a time when we ’re trying to find savings everywhere else across government , spending a quarter of a million on a ‘ feasibility study ’ seems like a waste of money , especially on top of the cash already frittered away on forestry and fig trees in the building			1
‘ the @entity10 employs an army of maintenance officials and engineers and it should n’t require extra administration or bureaucracy to work out a permanent solution			1
‘ politicians talk a lot about fixing the roof when it comes to the economy , but when it comes to taxpayers ’ cash it needs to be done as cheaply as possible			0
’ its ’ construction ran to £ 235million after massive over-spending , and the building has been plagued by scandals from persistent cracks in the glass to the £ 400,000 cost of renting 12 decorative fig trees @entity8 was designed by award - winning architects @entity121 and partners and was opened by @entity123 13 years ago			1
officials were criticised after some £ 13million was lost to one of the contractors which sued @entity10 over a deal to supply wall and window units			0
then cracks appeared almost immediately and a section had to be replaced in 2005 for £ 100,000			0
more damage was discovered in 2008 and again in 2012 , apparently due to hot summer weather , and anti-shatter film had to be applied to parts of the glass to stop shards falling on staff			0
a report from the parliamentary director of @entity141 just after the pane crashed in march and released under @entity143 , recommended repair work straightaway			0
it said : ‘ a design team is being assembled to fully investigate the unique structure and design of the @entity150 roof and propose any necessary long term remedial measures			0
‘ this is likely to be a major undertaking			0
’ mps on the @entity156 committee have - after meetings with @entity10 officials - been asked to approve the costly work and feasibility study			1
a @entity50 spokesman said : ‘ in order to identify and mitigate the risk of future damage to the @entity8 roof , a professional specialist team is currently undertaking a detailed examination of all glazed units … and will determine the nature and potential costs of any remedial measures that may be required			2
‘ as we are always committed to achieving value for money for the taxpayer , the investigation will also identify the most cost - effective means to maintain the roof in future			0
any implementation of remedial work will follow the normal ‘ business case ’ process			0

almost half of the £ 488k sum has been spent on a ' feasibility study '
a permanent solution in the coming years could take the bill past £ 1million
@entity72 mp @entity71 said the repairs costs were ‘ astonishing '
