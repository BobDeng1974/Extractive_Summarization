by @entity0 scientists have uncovered a bizarre 165 million - year - old fossil with a gigantic sucking plate attached to its body			1
an international team recently discovered the spectacular fly larva fossil in the freshwater lakes of present - day @entity8 , @entity10			1
in this habitat , the parasite would crawl onto passing salamanders , attach itself with its sucking plate , and penetrate the thin skin of the amphibians in order to suck blood			1
thanks to the fine - grained mudstone , the details of the 0.7in ( 2cm ) long parasite @entity21 ( pictured ) are exceptionally preserved			2
the head was tiny in comparison to the body and was tube - shaped			1
the mid-body was completely transformed into a sucking plate while its abdomen had caterpillar - like legs the spectacular fly larva , which has received the scientific name of ‘ @entity21 ’ , was an unexpected find			1
‘ @entity35 ' in @entity10 means ' bizarre ' ; ' jurassica ' refers to the @entity38 period to which the fossils belong			0
to date no insect is known that has such a huge sucking plate			2
scientists believe the parasite , a fly larva around 0.7 - inches ( 2cm ) long , had undergone extreme changes over the course of evolution			2
for instance , the head was tiny in comparison to the body and was tube - shaped with piercer - like mouthparts at the front			1

‘ the parasite lived the life of @entity97 ’ , said professor @entity92 from the @entity93 of the @entity94			0
this is because there were many salamanders in the lakes , as fossil finds at the same location near @entity104 in @entity105 shown			0
‘ there scientists had also found around 300,000 diverse and exceptionally preserved fossil insects ’ , reports scientist dr @entity106 , who is researching in palaeontology at the @entity94			0
‘ no insect exists today with a comparable body shape ' , said dr @entity106			1
that the bizarre larva from the @entity38 has remained so well - preserved to the present day is partly due to the fine - grained mudstone in which the animals were embedded			0
' the finer the sediment , the better the details are reproduced in the fossils ' , explained dr @entity120 of the @entity121 of the @entity94			0
this reconstruction shows how scientists think the fly larvae attached itself to the skin of the salamander			0
' no insect exists today with a comparable body shape ' , said dr @entity106 astonishingly , no fossil fish are found in the freshwater lakes of this @entity38 epoch in @entity10			1
' on the other hand , there are almost unlimited finds of fossilised salamanders , which were found by the thousand ' , says dr @entity106			0
this unusual ecology could explain why the bizarre parasites survived in the lakes : fish are predators of fly larvae and usually keep them in check			0
' the extreme adaptations in the design of @entity21 show the extent to which organisms can specialise in the course of evolution ' , professor @entity92 said			0
a team of @entity152 and @entity10 researchers recently discovered the spectacular parasite fossil in the freshwater lakes of present - day @entity8 , @entity10 as unpleasant as the parasites were for the salamanders , their deaths were not caused by the fly larvae			1
' a parasite only sometimes kills its host when it has achieved its goal , for example , reproduction or feeding ' , dr @entity120 explained			0
if @entity167 had passed through the larval stage , it would have grown into an adult insect after completing metamorphosis			0
however , the scientists do n't yet have enough information to speculate as to what the adult would have looked like , and how it might have lived .			0

' @entity21 ' fossil was found in freshwater lakes of @entity8
fly larva is said to have been 0.7in ( 2cm ) long and had caterpillar - like legs
@entity183 was tiny and tube - shaped with piercer - like mouthparts at the front
parasite would crawl onto salamanders and attach with its sucking plate
it would then penetrate the thin skin of amphibians to suck their blood
‘ no insect exists today with a comparable body shape ' , the scientists said
