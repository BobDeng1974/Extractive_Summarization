by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:09 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 16:20 est , 27 january 2014 @entity3 , the @entity4 congressman who pleaded guilty to a cocaine charge in november , has resigned from @entity6 despite his earlier promise to forge ahead and remain in his job			1
he delivered a resignation letter to @entity11 speaker @entity10 on monday			0
' unfortunately , some of my struggles had serious consequences , ' he wrote			0
' while i have dealt with those issues on a personal level , it is my belief that i can not fully and effectively serve as a @entity11 to the place i call home , @entity4			0
' @entity3 , a former radio talk show host and television journalist , took a leave of absence from the @entity11 after a stint in rehab			2
it was unlikely that the first - term @entity29 would run for re-election			2
several challengers have cropped up in his heavily @entity29 @entity32 , @entity4 district , including @entity34 , the popular talk show host and @entity37 personality			1
' asked about the possibility during his january 22 @entity37 broadcast , he conceded , ' the answer is yes , i think about it			0
' @entity34 will be in @entity58 on tuesday to attend president @entity60 's @entity59 as a guest of hyper - conservative @entity63 @entity62 rep. @entity62			1
also in the mix is former state representative @entity65 , who finished third to @entity3 in a 2012 primary and has the support of a super pac with $ 1 million already in its coffers			2
former rep. @entity71 – who held @entity3 's seat until last year , may also run to replace @entity3			1
the congressman 's office confirmed his departure on monday but did n't offer further comment			0
a @entity11 @entity29 source told @entity78 that the timing of the congressman 's resignation is related to an investigation by the @entity83 , which was poised to recommend official sanctions against @entity3			1
that committee will now cease its work without issuing a formal report			0
the investigation was triggered by an @entity90 rule requiring action , or a written explanation of why no action was taken , within 30 days			0
zoned out : @entity3 has appeared in the past alongside prominent @entity29 leaders like house speaker @entity10 ( @entity96 ) and majority leader @entity97 ( r ) , but his days in the limelight may be over @entity99 , a liberal - leaning watchdog group , demanded an investigation on november 21 , the day after he entered his guilty plea in court			1
' rep. @entity3 's resignation is welcome , though overdue , ' the organization 's president , @entity104 , said monday			1
' the timing , however , is certainly suspicious			0
' ' why now ? it ’s not as if the @entity29 leadership just learned of the cocaine bust over the weekend			2
it seems possible his resignation is intended to stymie the ethics investigation that might have elicited damaging information about other members of @entity6 and congressional staff			0
' congressman @entity34 ? he 's admitted that the thought has crossed his mind the @entity29 of @entity4 had called for @entity3 's resignation shortly after he announced his entry into an intensive inpatient drug rehab program			1
he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in november , and drew a one - year probation sentence			2
' i 'm profoundly sorry to let down my family , particularly my wife and son , and the people of @entity4 , ' he wrote on @entity128 after his arrest for buying 3.5 grams of coke from an undercover police officer on october 29			1
. ' i struggle with the disease of alcoholism , and this led to an extremely irresponsible choice			0
as the father of a young son and a husband to a loving wife , i need to get help so i can be a better man for both of them			0
' @entity143 , @entity4 sheriff @entity144 , a @entity29 , has been a source of unrelenting pressure on @entity3 since his public troubles began			1
' while @entity3 returned to his congressional office following a microwave stint in rehab and a gaggle of rehearsed apologies , i have hundreds of inmates in our jail that are unable to return to their home due to similar or lesser drug offenses , " @entity144 wrote this month on @entity128			2
' the sad reality is that @entity3 does not even qualify to drive a @entity143 school bus at this point , yet he occupies a seat in @entity6			1
i have fired deputies for less			0

the @entity4 *tea* - party @entity29 came back to work after @entity6 ' winter recess , but wo n't stay past january
@entity3 entered an intensive inpatient drug rehab program in november after pleading guilty to buying 3.5 grams of cocaine from an undercover cop
@entity34 , the popular conservative media personality , is *mulling* a run for @entity3 's seat , as is @entity178 – who held it before @entity3 won in 2012
the @entity83 was *nearing* the *completion* of a *damning* report , but @entity3 's resignation means it will never be released
