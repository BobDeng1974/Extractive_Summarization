‘ this came up at @entity21 this morning			2
i said that within the next few weeks we should be seeing petrol down to round about £ 1 a litre			1
that is what people should be expecting and pushing for			0
‘ we saw the price fall again to below $ 50 a barrel two to three weeks ago			2
so there ’s a six week time lag before that gets passed through at the pumps , so there should be further cuts			1
treasury minister @entity7 today briefed the @entity21 on the latest treasury forecasts , and the expectation that the price will hit £ 1 within less than a month ‘ i will certainly be pressing the fuel retailers to make sure we continue to see the pass through			1

but bus firms in particular complain that they bought their fuel in advance to protect themselves from rising costs , and are yet to see the benefit of falls			0
mr @entity7 insisted the excuses were not good enough : ‘ i think bus passengers are going to say well we should be seeing this passed on to us			0
i ’m looking at the moment into is there anything more we can do in that area			0

clearly someone is making a lot of money out of this , i ’d quite like to find out who it is and see what we can do to accelerate it			0
‘ when you see such a massive shift , i really do want to see that passed on to not just people who are filling up their car but people who are travelling by bus , people who are travelling by plane , people who are buying package holidays			0
