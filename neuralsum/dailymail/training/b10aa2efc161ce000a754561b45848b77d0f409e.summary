by @entity0 published : 16:52 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 17:32 est , 16 october 2013 for centuries it was the myth that transfixed fortune - hunters : @entity4 , the dazzling city made of gold , hidden in deepest @entity7			1
countless @entity9 bounty seekers lost their lives in search of this legendary place			1
others believed that @entity4 was not a city at all , but a man painted with powdered gold who had dived into @entity18 , near the modern @entity20 capital of @entity21 , and whose priceless body lay waiting to be discovered			1
neither the city nor the man was ever found			2
but as a new exhibition at the @entity26 , opening today , shows , @entity9 explorers did find an ancient civilisation seemingly obsessed with gold and other precious metals , mined in the @entity31			1
in the new show , 200 objects from the @entity47 in @entity21 and 100 from the @entity26 reveal just how devoted to gold the pre-hispanic civilisations , from 1600 bc to ad 1600 , were			1
they did n’t see gold as a currency but as a magical material of great symbolic and spiritual meaning , closely connected to the immense powers of the sun. gold was used to make models of the alligators and jaguars to be found in the @entity7 jungles			1
the ancient @entity20 revered the animals and thought that if they donned their skins , they could assume their athletic powers			0
the jaguar was particularly prized for its strength and ferocity , and its skins were worn by the society ’s leaders			2
figure of fear : this flask , or ' poporo ' , shows a human face wearing a peacock headdress one star exhibit in this show is a flask in the shape of a jaguar made from hammered gold sheets — with a platinum ring strung through its nose			2
@entity84 was as prized as gold in ancient @entity20			2
in order to make the transition from the human world to the animal one , these pre-hispanic civilisations also devised golden costumes			0
‘ birds , bats , felines , amphibians , snakes and alligators were just some of the powerful disguises adopted , ’ says @entity92 , the curator of the show			0
sitting pretty : this female figure , left , which would have been used for holding lime powder , features in the exhibition alongside this religious chest ornament , right ‘ representations of these animals were frequently made in elaborate gold pieces			2
‘ @entity110 objects , including nose , lip and ear ornaments , diadems [ ornamental headbands ] , pectorals [ decorations worn on the chest ] and pendants enabled a person ’s physical transformation , together with paint , animal pelts and feathers			2
’ they used gold , too , to contain their favourite narcotic stimulants from plants including tobacco , cocaine and the yopo — a tree that produces leaves and beans with hallucinogenic effects			2
on show at the @entity26 is a huge , egg - shaped shell of gold alloy , 21.4cm long and 10.5cm wide			1
finery : the @entity141 people used gold for all sorts of ornaments , including this necklace this priceless artefact was made purely for the purpose of holding coca leaves			1
another exhibit shows a man sitting down in a state of blissful leisure , chewing on a wad of the same leaves			0
the pre-hispanic civilisations became extremely adept at drug - taking			0
in order for the stimulants to be absorbed better , they were combined with a chalky powder made from lime and smashed seashells			0
delicately carved golden dippers — like pipettes — were used to carry the intoxicating powder from elaborate drug pouches to the mouth			0
at other times they used gold snuff trays — like ornate mini-shovels — piled high with dried or crushed yopo seeds , which they then swallowed or sniffed			2
by taking these intoxicating substances , the men of this ancient civilisation believed that their spirits might leave their bodies — just as they did through the wearing of animal skins			0
dazzling : an alligator pendant			2
powerful creatures were revered and often crafted from gold a priest told one of the first @entity187 colonials that , under the influence of yopo beans , he had ‘ flown ’ a vast distance to and from the distant village of @entity192 in a single night			1
so the idea of the drug trip is certainly nothing new			0
but the world of @entity4 was far from being a zonked - out , peace - and - love civilisation			1
many of the gold objects in the @entity26 exhibition are devoted to warfare , including spear - throwers — sheaths in which a spear was placed before it was hurled , to give it greater reach			1
one tunjo — or religious figurine — in the exhibition shows a small golden figure at work on the most spine - chilling of activities : headhunting			0
grisly : this figure shows a headhunter carrying a shrunken head in one hand he holds a bow and arrows , in the other the shrunken head of his victim			0
two other tunjos show a pair of dead victims tied to sacrificial poles			0
headhunting is thought to have been a common practice in warfare , and these tunjos are supposed by experts to symbolise victory on the battlefield over rival tribes			0
the 16th - century @entity187 chronicler @entity236 described the ritual , saying : ‘ if the men of @entity21 kill or take any @entity241 prisoner , they take the heads back to their homeland and put them in their oratories [ or prayer chapels ]			1
’ meanwhile , in @entity187 at around the same time , men were becoming ever more obsessed with the lure of gold			1
as @entity249 wrote to the king and queen of @entity187 in 1503 : ‘ gold is the most exquisite of all things			1
whoever possesses gold can acquire all that he desires in this world			2
truly , for gold he can acquire entrance for his soul into paradise			0
’ and so , from the early years of the 16th century onwards , @entity187 adventurers , their imaginations fired by tales of @entity4 , poured into @entity7 in search of gold			1
it was this precious metal , in fact , that provided the main reason for colonising @entity7			1
‘ in their eagerness to obtain gold they paid scant attention to the objects into which it was fashioned , ’ says @entity92			0
‘ they had no interest in how or why such items were crafted , or in the archaeological contexts in which they were found : treasure seekers looted burial mounds and often melted down the gold items they found			1
’ in a 1550 ruling by the royal @entity187 legal court , all pre-hispanic objects were divided into two categories : gold was to be melted down in furnaces for currency ; ritual objects made of bone , shell , wood and feathers — classed as ‘ idols of the @entity299 ’ — were to be confiscated and destroyed			1
thus the survival of the objects in the @entity26 exhibition is near miraculous , given that ancient tombs , piled high with food , drink , fine textiles and gold masks and chest ornaments for use in the afterlife , were plundered and despoiled			1
but what really fuelled the @entity187 ’ gold fever was the legend of @entity4 , the @entity314			1
mask : this artefact may have been stored away for use in the afterlife the story is first mentioned by @entity236 in his history of the region , written from 1535 to 1548			0
@entity236 tells of a ‘ golden king ’ who ‘ went about covered with powdered gold , as casually as if it were powdered salt ’			0
in time , this story became magnified and embellished until @entity9 adventurers , including sir @entity328 — and his son @entity329 , who was killed battling the @entity187 over @entity7 gold — began to believe in a whole golden city or kingdom			1
however implausible it may seem to us now , there was a tiny kernel of truth at the heart of the fabulously embroidered tale			0
the @entity341 people of ancient @entity20 were known to have carried out ritual practices on the shores of @entity18 , a round lake that sits in the crater of an extinct volcano			0
tales of one ritual captured @entity9 ’s imagination like no other			1
at its height , a @entity341 leader was covered in gold dust and taken on a raft to the middle of the lake , where he and his servants threw piles of gold , emeralds and other jewels into the water			0
intricate : this golden helmet has been elaborately patterned by ancient craftsmen it was believed that these treasures would reach the gods , who would restore order to the world			0
among the gold objects were those tunjos — ritual human figurines			0
one miraculous @entity375 that survives shows the raft ritual as it happened			0
a large figure stands in the middle of the raft , attended on all sides by smaller figures			0
the main figure is adorned with a gold head - dress , chest plates and nose ornaments			2
full - size versions of these golden religious ornaments are also on show at the @entity26			1
little wonder that , as soon as the @entity187 heard of this ritual , they rushed to drain the lake			2
in 1580 a notch was cut in the crater that reduced the water level by 20 metres before the crater collapsed , drowning many of the workers			0
some of the discoveries there — golden ornaments , jewellery and armour — were sent to @entity404 of @entity187 , and a great , ugly scar runs through the side of the crater to this day			1
then , in 1910 , a group of @entity409 speculators again tried to drain the crater and recovered some gold ornaments and pottery from the bottom of the lake			2
but they never found the spectacular hoard they sought			0
the @entity20 government has outlawed draining of the lake now , so the remaining secrets of @entity4 , which have fascinated explorers for centuries , will lie concealed and undisturbed , deep beneath its waters — at least until the glittering myth once again proves too great a temptation for explorers to resist .			1

the myth of @entity4 has gripped explorers for centuries
@entity9 bounty hunters in @entity7 found a society transfixed by gold , which was used for a wide variety of intricate and dazzling ornaments
@entity187 *conquistadors* tried to melt down or destroy it all
surviving artefacts have been put on display at the @entity26
beyond @entity4 : @entity444 is at the @entity26 until march 23 , 2014 .
