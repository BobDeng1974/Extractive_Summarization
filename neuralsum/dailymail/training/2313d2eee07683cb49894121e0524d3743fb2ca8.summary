the sheriff leading the investigation into the cinema shooting which happened after a row over texting has told @entity5 there is no chance of a @entity9 defence , saying , ‘ it was an empty movie theatre			1
if he was scared why did n’t he move seats ? ’			0
sheriff @entity12 has completely dismissed shooter @entity13 ’ claims that he gunned down @entity15 because he feared for his safety and said there is no way he can use @entity20 ’s controversial self - defence law			1
he is convinced the retired cop , 71 , simply lost his temper after married father - of - one @entity15 refused to stop texting and then threw a bag of popcorn at his killer ’s face			1
a source told @entity5 : ' although she was only very slightly unwell , he was concerned to know how she was feeling ' @entity13 ’ attorney @entity43 suggested on wednesday that his client was not hit with popcorn and was actually attacked with another more dangerous ' dark object '			1
however @entity47 has completely dismissed that idea , saying nothing else was thrown and that monday ’s shooting is an open and shut case			1
speaking to @entity5 the @entity52 said : ‘ @entity9 is a hot topic in @entity20			1
even if you have a clear @entity9 case then you still have to work incredibly hard to prove that is valid			1
‘ so from our perspective , if we think it is going to be used as a defense we have to prove why it ’s not relevant			2
we immediately brought in our states attorney ’s office to work with us after monday ’s shooting			0
‘ i remember very clearly that we stood outside the movie theatre , got all the detectives over and said , " what do we think we ’ve got here ? is this a @entity9 case ? " everyone said , no way , this is not @entity9			1
‘ one of the key elements is that the theater was not packed so there was ample opportunity for anybody to move their seat if they wanted to			2
‘ from our investigation it seems simply that the agitation of someone using their cell phone to text has caused this			0
all the evidence and witness statements we have point that way			0
‘ the suspect was sitting there , they had an argument about texting , the victim turned around , threw something , a shot is fired and the next thing you know a man is dead			1
’ support : @entity101 and friends of @entity13 attend his tuesday morning hearing @entity43 , the attorney for @entity13 , talks to reporters after his client 's first hearing another shot ? @entity12 said @entity108 may have been planning to shoot again but his gun was jammed			1
@entity110 added that it is not relevant to the investigation former @entity114 police captain @entity13 was in the @entity116 theater with his wife @entity117 watching ‘ @entity119 ’ when he asked @entity15 to stop using his phone			1
@entity15 , 43 – who was with his wife @entity36 – was texting the babysitter looking after his two - year - old daughter @entity37 and he refused to stop			1
@entity13 went out to get a manager , came back alone and continued the row			1
@entity12 explained : ‘ we believe the manager did n’t have a full conversation with the individual because he was dealing with other customers			1
‘ but the fact the suspect had the ability to go and see the manager , shows he had the ability to move his seat			0
’ soon after the row restarted , @entity15 threw a bag of popcorn in @entity13 face and the older man drew a pistol from his pocket			1
@entity143 desperately tried to shield her husband , but @entity13 fired his weapon and the bullet passed through her outstretched hand and hit @entity15 in the chest			1
@entity108 then placed the gun on his thigh and calmly sat down , before being restrained by an off - duty deputy			1
his gun was jammed when it was recovered and investigators are not sure whether he tried to fire a second time			1
sheriff @entity12 said : ‘ after he shot his weapon he put it down			1
it was jammed when he put it down on his thigh			2
‘ i ca n’t tell you if he was trying to shoot again , or what he was doing			2
we will look at the gun to see what happened in the future , but that is n’t relevant to the second degree murder charge at present			2
’ today @entity43 was quoted as saying something more than popcorn was thrown			1
he told the @entity170 : ‘ if it was popcorn , do n't you think the detective would have written popcorn ? it 's an unknown object , dark in color			1
those facts will come out			0
’ but @entity12 hit back : ‘ there is absolutely nothing to prove anything else was thrown			1
’ since the shooting a couple , @entity180 and @entity181 have said they had a run in with @entity13 in the same cinema back in december after they used their cell phone			2
senseless killing : @entity143 was shot in the hand and @entity15 shot fatally in the chest sheriff @entity12 says they are looking into the claims and they could help the case against father - of - two @entity13			1
he said : ‘ other people are now saying this happened to them			2
we are currently trying to verify those statements , using credit card statements to make sure they were definitely at the movies when they said they were			0
if we can verify that then it gives us even more to go on			0
