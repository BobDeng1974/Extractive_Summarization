@entity2 exports to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to the @entity6 , official figures showed yesterday			1
it is the first time since records began that such sales of @entity2 goods have outstripped those to the @entity6 for six months in a row			1
previously they have beaten @entity6 exports on a quarterly basis – or three months – but never for such a sustained period			0
the figures appear to vindicate @entity19 's ' mercantile ' foreign policy , which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world in order to refocus trade away from the @entity6 's struggling economies			2
they are also a major rebuff to @entity27 , who claimed in a speech this week that quitting the @entity6 would cause ' significant damage to our economy '			1
meanwhile eurosceptics will seize on the figures as evidence that @entity2 could carve out a prosperous future outside the @entity6			2
the news that @entity2 sales to the rest of the world are surging ahead of those to @entity40 is a major blow to former prime minister @entity27 's claim that leaving the @entity6 would damage the economy the figures appear to vindicate @entity19 's ' mercantile ' foreign policy , which has seen him lead trade missions all over the world but total sales of @entity2 goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a ' straitjacket ' on exporters			1

exports to the @entity62 were worth £ 147.9billion in 2014 compared with £ 144.9billion to @entity64 countries			0

@entity76 , chief executive of @entity77 , said : ' these figures put the kibosh on the scaremongering from the @entity82 cabal that would have had us stuck in the euro today			0
' the @entity6 makes up a declining share of our trade yet its out - of - date rules make it harder for the @entity2 to do business across the globe			2
' with firms on the @entity62 so reliant on trade with the @entity2 we are in a strong position to renegotiate our relationship inside the @entity6 or secure a trade deal outside altogether			1
' @entity2 goods overseas have fallen to the lowest level for nearly five years amid warnings that the strong pound and weak eurozone are acting like a ' straitjacket ' on exporters in a ringing endorsement of @entity2 's @entity6 membership this week , mr @entity27 said : ' i believe passionately that leaving @entity40 would leave @entity2 diminished in the world , do significant damage to our economy and , less obviously but just as important to our future , would go against the very qualities that mark us out still as a great global nation			1

@entity134 , head of trade policy at the @entity136 , said : ' our trade deficit in goods with the @entity6 continues to widen , reflecting weak demand caused by prolonged stagnation in the eurozone			2
this underlines the need to reorient our focus on key emerging markets , including @entity147			0
the government should be pushing the @entity6 as hard as possible to secure trade deals with countries where tariffs on goods still matter for @entity2 manufacturing exporters			1
' under the coalition led by @entity19 , exports to the @entity62 were worth £ 147.9billion in 2014 compared with £ 144.9billion to @entity64 countries meanwhile the pound has risen by nearly 20 per cent against the euro in the last two years – making it more expensive for buyers in the single currency bloc to buy goods made in @entity2 factories			2
during this time , @entity2 firms have sought to exploit faster - growing markets such as @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			2
@entity169 , an economist at the @entity170 and @entity171 , said : ' there has been a certain amount of conscious redirecting of exports through trade missions and trade deals with partners outside the @entity6			0

unless we see firm action to improve our export performance , it is not clear how we will sustain strong growth in the long - term			0
' @entity209 , @entity2 economist at @entity210 , said the bleak figures ' will re-ignite fears that the strong pound and weakness in demand in the euro - zone is acting as a straightjacket on exporters '			1
