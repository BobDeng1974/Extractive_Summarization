however , the meeting could have significance on the ground beyond mere symbolism			0
the meeting will also cement @entity1 ' reputation as a leader unhindered by diplomatic and theological protocol who is willing to go out on a limb for the sake of peace			2
' in the @entity3 , symbolic gestures and incremental steps are important , ' noted the rev. @entity54 , a veteran @entity7 analyst for the @entity55			0
' and who knows what conversations can occur behind closed doors in the @entity7			0
' the unusual prayer summit was a feat of diplomatic and religious protocol , organized in the two weeks since @entity1 issued the surprise invitation to @entity9 and @entity11 from @entity64 in @entity65			2

officials say the @entity1 invited the two leaders to his home in a bid to rekindle a desire for peace the three men make their way to the service			2
the meeting will no doubt cement the @entity1 's reputation as a leader who is willing to go out on a limb for the sake of peace it took place in the @entity7 gardens in the shadow of @entity87 , the most religiously neutral place in the tiny city - state			1
it incorporated @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 prayers - delivered in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
the prayers focused on three themes common to each of the religions : thanking @entity96 for creation , seeking forgiveness for past wrongdoing and praying to @entity96 to bring peace to the region			0
@entity1 , @entity9 and @entity11 were expected to deliver brief remarks , shake hands and plant an olive tree together in a sign of peace			1

a view inside @entity87 showing the @entity110 taking place this evening pope @entity1 led the prayer summit this evening - which focused on three themes : thanking @entity96 for creation , seeking forgiveness and praying for peace @entity7 officials have described the prayer evening as something of a ' time - out ' in political negotiations , merely designed to rekindle the desire for peace through prayers common to all the main faith traditions in the @entity125			1
but even @entity1 ' secretary of state , cardinal @entity126 , has said the power of prayer should n't be discounted for its ability to change the reality on the ground			0
' prayer has a political strength that we maybe do n't even realize and should be exploited to the full , ' he said at the end of @entity1 ' trip			2
' prayer has the ability to transform hearts , and thus to transform history			0
' that said , no concrete results are expected : @entity9 has no formal role in peace negotiations , holds a largely ceremonial post and leaves office at the end of the month			0
but @entity147 , a political adviser to @entity9 , said sunday the @entity5 government authorized the trip and @entity5 prime minister @entity150 was in ' constant contact ' with @entity9			2
pope @entity1 during the mass. @entity7 officials have described the evening as a ' time - out ' in political negotiations the pope blesses the altar			1
no concrete solutions are expected following the event - arranged following a surprise invite to the leaders two weeks ago pope @entity1 holds the book of the gospels during the evening prayers			1
the @entity5 president is due to step down from his role at the end of the month speaking on @entity167 , @entity147 stressed the meeting was not political , even though he said @entity9 and @entity11 were expected to discuss political developments when they meet in private after the prayer			1
@entity150 had urged the world to shun @entity11 ' new unity government which took office last week because it is backed by the @entity29 militant group @entity174			2
his pleas have been ignored by the @entity176 , with both the @entity18 and the @entity177 saying they will give the unity government a chance			0
@entity9 ' participation thus undermines @entity150 's attempts to isolate the @entity6 , and instead adds to the growing isolation of @entity150 's hard - line position			0
@entity150 's office has declined repeated requests for comment about the @entity7 summit			0
pope @entity1 sits centre stage during the events this evening pope @entity1 celebrates a mass of @entity192 in @entity87 nevertheless , @entity147 stressed that the meeting had a different aspect to it			1
he said : ' the government of @entity5 decided not to hold political negotiations , but we are n't talking about political negotiations			0
' we are talking about a different gesture , a spiritual gesture , an act of public diplomacy			0
' @entity11 told @entity34 daily @entity203 that @entity1 ' invitation was ' an act of great courage ' ' nothing should stop us in the search for solutions so that both of our people can live in their own sovereign state , ' he was quoted as saying in sunday 's editions .			2
