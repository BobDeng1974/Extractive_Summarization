a grandmother who survived a 13 - storey plunge down an elevator shaft finally overcame her fears and got back in the lift for the first time in 15 years - only to get stuck			1
pensioner @entity6 , now 65 , her daughter and her then six - month - old granddaughter were lucky to escape with their lives when the cable snapped in the lift in a council block in @entity12 , north - east @entity13 , in 1999			1
she vowed never to use an elevator again , but three weeks ago , after returning home with heavy shopping and facing a 196 - step climb , she decided to chance it			1
ms @entity6 was stuck for more than two hours waiting for help to arrive because of a firefighters ' strike			1
she said : ' i 'm asthmatic and diabetic so i felt i had to use it			0
but when i was trapped i thought i was going to have a panic attack			2
' i 've just had enough now			0
it was a very scary experience			0
' it was the first time she had used a lift since her terrifying experience in 1999 , when the emergency brakes kicked in moments before the carriage would have slammed into the ground , stopping the family just inches from almost certain death			2
the first lift accident saw ms @entity6 , her daughter @entity48 and her grandson @entity49 plummet from the 14th floor , where she lives , to the ground floor			1
the grandmother said : ' it was terrifying , i 've never experienced anything like it before			2
we were all in such shock - and we got whiplash			2
' i 'd only been in the building about two weeks - it was n't the best welcome			0
' ms @entity6 , who made a full recovery after the first incident , developed an acute fear of using the lift and climbs 14 storeys of stairs to get to her flat			1
the lift dropped several feet and stopped working , leaving the unlucky grandmother trapped for hours now ms @entity6 wants @entity71 to move her to a new building , preferably with a ground floor flat she said : ' for a long time i avoided the lift , because the memories were too scary			1
' but last month i had just had enough , and could n't manage carrying my shopping up almost 200 stairs on my own			0
' i was panicking a bit , but as soon as the doors closed there was a loud bang and the entire thing dropped			0
i thought i was going to die			0
' but it did n't fall very far and i was able to use the emergency button to call for help			0
' still , they took their time coming to rescue me - that was the longest two hours of my life			2
' i want the council to give me a ground floor flat somewhere now			1
i 'm never using a lift again			0
' the retired cleaner lives in the flat with her 36 - year - old son , who said the lift had been making a funny ' groaning noise ' for the last couple of weeks			1
@entity71 , who manage the @entity101 building , say they will fix the lift and apologised to the shaken grandmother			1
deputy council leader @entity103 said : ' we are really very sorry to hear that ms @entity6 was trapped in the lift			1
' a combination of factors led to a delay in responding to this incident			0
a technician has since reviewed the condition of the lift and it is now fully working			0
' this was a very unfortunate incident and we want to reassure tenants that this does n't happen very often			0
