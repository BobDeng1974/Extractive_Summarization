by @entity0 published : 06:31 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 10:16 est , 29 october 2012 hair straighteners are causing ' horrific injuries ' to hundreds of young children across the @entity5 , a safety charity has warned			1
the @entity6 said at one hospital in @entity8 , one in 10 of children admitted with burns , had been injured by the beauty device with some needing plastic surgery			1
hair straighteners can reach scorching temperatures of @entity15 - hot enough to fry an egg			1
as they take 40 minutes to cool they remain dangerously hot for far longer than many parents realise			1
figures released by the @entity33 show that 17 children aged between three months and nine years attended @entity35 at the hospital in 2009 - 10 with hair straightener burns			1
the average age of the patient was just 18months			0
they represented nine per cent of the 187 children who attended with ' thermal injuries ' during that year			1
in june this year , the @entity43 in @entity44 revealed is had treated 110 children for serious burns in the last five years			1
the @entity6 have urged parents to remember the three @entity49 's ... @entity51 hair straighteners off and unplug them straight away slide them into a heat resistant bag store them out of the sight and reach of children they add to take care not to burn yourself when using straighteners by making sure you do n't place them too close to your scalp or ears			1
across the @entity5 this would add up to hundreds of serious injuries every year , with thousands more receiving minor injuries			0
children are most likely to receive burns to their hands , however children have also sustained injuries to the head , arm and foot			1
@entity77 , a mother from @entity78 , revealed her 19 - month old toddler was injured after falling onto her straighteners a year ago just after she had switched them off			0
although she whisked him away , just a couple of seconds did serious damage			0
she said : ' @entity86 has just learned to shuffle so he was moving along the bed , he caught himself in the sheets and just fell forward onto the straighteners			0
' the middle of his eyebrows was all red and his skin had melted			2
if the straighteners had been any hotter , they would have peeled off his forehead			0
' @entity86 was lucky that he did n't lose his eyes , although he has been scarred for life			0
' now @entity6 are working with the @entity99 on a ' @entity100 ' to raise awareness of the risks			0
@entity103 received facial burns after he fell onto his mother 's straighteners @entity107 , @entity6 ’s public health adviser , said : ' the campaign in @entity8 builds on other awareness - raising work that @entity6 has been carrying out across the @entity5			1
' we know from reports and from talking to the people who work in @entity35 that burns from hair straighteners is a significant issue and a national problem			2
' and yet the risks posed are so easy to reduce			0
simply by putting these devices into heat resistant bags after use , and storing them in a place that ’s out of the sight and reach of children , we can go a long way to preventing the kind of burns which can scar for life			1
' the campaign has created a video to show just how hot straighteners can become			2
dr @entity133 , consultant in paediatric emergency medicine at the @entity135 , said : ' hair straightener burns are preventable			2
the @entity100 to handle campaign will highlight how dangerous these devices are , particularly to small children and that the public need to be aware of the horrific injuries that can be sustained			2
' @entity142 , director general at the @entity143 , said : “ the @entity143 is delighted to support the @entity100 to handle campaign			0
' our grants funding schemes mean that we can work with organisations like @entity148 to raise awareness of electrical dangers in the home and to change people ’s behaviour so that they act more responsibly around electricity			0
' electrical goods are now common items in people ’s homes , so it is essential that they understand the risks associated with products like hair straighteners , particularly when they are using them around children			2
by taking the simple steps suggested in the campaign , people will be able to protect themselves and their families			0
' video : too hot to handle ! hair straighteners can reach @entity15 !			1

the beauty product can reach @entity15 , which is hot enough to fry an egg
children 's skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults so far more *vulnerable* to burns
@entity180 takes 40 minutes to cool down
