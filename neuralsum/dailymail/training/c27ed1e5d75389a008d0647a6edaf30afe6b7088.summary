@entity10 said : ' based on my experience over the past 17 months and through the most recent managerial search , it became clear to me that the new @entity4 manager - in fact , the entire football operation - would benefit from someone whose sole responsibility was to focus on the short , mid and long - term product on the pitch			2
@entity0 has quit his role as the @entity1 's head of talent identification to join @entity4 @entity0 , who formerly worked as technical director at @entity30 and @entity31 , was only at the @entity1 for one year ' in my mind , that called for a head of all football activities that would report directly to me but work collaboratively with kit , our scouting group , the @entity32 , sports performance medical and our analytics team			1
' this was n't a revelation , but rather the recognition that the challenges football clubs face today are more complex than ever and our ambition requires that we organise in the optimal way to achieve our goals			0

' we are really sorry to see @entity0 go but we totally understand his reasons , ' said @entity72 , in a statement released by the @entity1			2
' it was always likely he would move back into club football at some stage , as this type of role becomes increasingly common within the game			0
