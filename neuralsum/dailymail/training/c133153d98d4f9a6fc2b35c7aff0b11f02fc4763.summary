by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:56 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 11 october 2013 one of two men who claim that they encountered an unidentified flying object and its inhabitants 40 years ago on the banks of the @entity6 has said that he has never come to terms with the extra-terrestrial encounter			1
@entity10 , who became famous along with @entity10 after reporting the sighting , says the encounter on october 11 , 1973 turned his life upside down			1
' this is something i really did n't want to happen , ' @entity10 told @entity1 as the 40th anniversary of the encounter approached			1
he tried to dodge the spotlight for decades , moving frequently before returning to @entity34 's @entity33 in recent years			1
@entity10 never regretted the notoriety that came his way after he told authorities he encountered an unidentified flying object and its occupants 40 years ago on the banks of the @entity6			1
until his death in 2011 , @entity10 told his story to anyone who would listen			1
the incident made headlines , sparked a wave of @entity30 sightings nationwide and became one of the most widely examined cases on record			2
skeptics ranged from the deputies who first interviewed the men to an author who sought to poke holes in the story , and @entity10 himself has had conflicting thoughts about whether he was visited by aliens or demons			1
@entity10 , now 58 , was 18 when he went fishing with @entity10 on a tranquil thursday night after work			1
embracing it : @entity24 , who died in 2011 , enjoyed the fame and regularly told the story of the crab - clawed extra terrestrials to anyone who would listen but @entity10 had the opposite reaction as they dangled their lines without much luck , the two said a ufo with blue lights swooped down			1
they told of a zipping noise made by the object			2
@entity10 , then 42 , said three creatures with leathery gray skin and crab - like claws - he thought they were robots - took them by the forearms and levitated them aboard the craft			1
he said something that looked like a large floating eye appeared to examine him			1
@entity10 says he was conscious but paralyzed			1
' they gave a thorough , i mean a thorough , examination to me just like any doctor would , ' he said			2
and then they were back on the shore , where it all began			2
the @entity30 was gone and @entity10 said they tried to collect themselves			1
@entity10 needed three shots of liquor from a bottle in his car to calm his nerves before deciding to report what happened			1
at the @entity99 , deputies initially suspected both men were drunk			2
reliving it : @entity10 said that the police did not believe him and @entity24 but eventually realized they were not lying getting out of dodge : @entity10 took out of state construction jobs following the incident to avoid the attention then - capt. @entity107 , who still works for the sheriff 's office , said he laughed at the report , but met with the men			1
@entity10 and @entity10 stuck to their story			1
after the formal interview , deputies left @entity10 and @entity10 together in a room with a hidden tape recorder , hoping to catch them in a lie			1
' me and the other investigator got up and left to let them talk , to see if they were going to say , “ well , we got them fooled , ” but they did n't , ' @entity107 said			0
' they were really concerned			0
' another sighting : @entity24 , seen here in 2001 , said that he had a similar encounter in 1974 on the tape , @entity10 tells @entity10 , ' it scared me to death too , son			1
you ca n't get over it in a lifetime			0
' ' i do n't know what happened to them , ' @entity107 said			0
' i was n't there with them , but i know you do n't fake fear , and they were fearful			0
' the next afternoon , the story was splashed across the front pages of newspapers in @entity6 and @entity150			0
overnight , @entity6 became a magnet for news reporters and @entity30 investigators			0
widespread interest in @entity30 began in the 1940s with an incident at @entity157 , in which @entity30 enthusiasts believe the government got its hands on a crashed @entity30 and alien bodies			0
the government spent decades denying it			0
in the 1960s , interest flared anew with a series of reports , including the purported alien abduction of @entity169 couple @entity167 in 1961			0
the widespread attention to the @entity6 encounter set off a new round of reports			0
in south @entity34 , hundreds of reports overwhelmed authorities in the two weeks after the @entity175 encounter			1
there were hoaxes and humor too			0
a @entity180 , @entity181 , taxi driver told police a being with pincers tapped on his window , a story he admitted days later was fake			0
a @entity186 , @entity188 television station said it would record a @entity30 appearance predicted by a psychic between @entity186 and nearby @entity6			0
roughly 1,000 cars converged on the spot , where nothing happened			0
an @entity195 alderman proposed an ordinance making it illegal to operate a ufo at more than twice the speed of light on @entity200 90 , the coast 's main drag			0
mayor @entity203 voted against the ordinance , joking he did n't want to discourage tourism			0
@entity30 skeptic @entity206 believed @entity10 and @entity10 's report was a hoax			1
in his book ' ufos explained , ' he noted @entity10 changed some details of his story and claimed a polygraph operator whose test @entity10 passed was n't up to the task			1
@entity10 later passed a lie detector test himself			1
interpretation : @entity24 , seen here in 1998 , said at one point that they could have been demons @entity10 would go on to appear on talk shows , give lectures and interviews , and self - publish a book in 1983 titled ' @entity225 at @entity6			1
' he reported three more encounters in 1974 , and said the aliens communicated to him that they were peaceful			2
' the only thing he wanted to do was let everybody know we were not alone , ' said @entity231 , his son			0
' he did n't care if you believed him or not			0
if you wanted to listen , by gum , he 'd tell you			0
' ' he could never understand why he was chosen , ' the younger @entity10 added			1
' but he never once told me that he wished it had never happened			0
' @entity10 said the intrusions by curiosity seekers have become less frequent over the years , but have never really let up			1
' you do n't never have no privacy , ' he said			0
@entity10 married later in 1973 and eventually took oil industry and out - of - state construction jobs to escape the attention			1
local celebrity : @entity10 said he regularly gets recognized when he visits the area near the abduction site ' by the time you get somewhere and they figure out who you were , i 'd just go , ' he said			2
' i 'd just go find another job somewhere			0
' @entity10 attended some @entity30 conventions , and was once hypnotized by @entity253 , a noted @entity30 investigator			2
he briefly tried to capitalize on his story in 1993 by starting a @entity256 company called @entity257 where he and partners would produce television segments on the subject			0
@entity10 moved to @entity261 in 2006 and in 2010 suffered a stroke that limited him physically			2
he 's on disability aid now , but sometimes boats by the site of the encounter when he goes fishing			2
he said that just recently he met a woman at a gas station who already knew who he was			0
' i 'm always recognized , ' he said			0
there 's no historical marker on the river bank noting the encounter , and stores do n't sell @entity30 souvenirs			0
but local people remember - though often with skepticism and jokes			2
for his part , @entity10 said he 's had conflicting thoughts over the years about that night in 1973			1
at one point , he was n't even sure the creatures were aliens			2
they might have been demons , he said			0
' i 'm a firm believer in @entity288 and where there 's good , there 's bad , ' @entity10 said .			2
