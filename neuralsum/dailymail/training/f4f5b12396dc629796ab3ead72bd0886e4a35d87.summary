mr @entity9 said : ' i had n't sat on a bike for a couple of months prior to starting so i had to get used to it again			1
' i 'm not really a cyclist , the bicycle was a conveniently cheap and deliberately slow means to an end			1
' the end being to see the world , meet interesting people and to challenge myself both physically and mentally			0
hopefully , i 've learnt a thing or two along the way too			0
' i cycled out of my village , took a ferry across the channel then did n't stop			2
i flew a few times over war spots for safety , but other than that , i rode most places			0

but the route quickly snowballed and soon mr @entity9 had quadrupled the length of his route			2

' i was detained at the boarder between @entity190 and @entity138 because they thought , after looking at me , my passport and some of the pictures i had taken i might be a spy			0
' they put two and two together and made 12 , but they released me soon after			0
in @entity143 i was chased by elephants on a road aptly named " elephant highway "			2
' the elephants just graze by the side of the road and they are used to vehicles driving past them , but they do n't see so many bicycles			2
' it 's an animal shape moving at speed on wheels , they were bound to get a bit jumpy			0
' i had a large bull elephant stand there and face up to me flapping his ears before he began chasing towards me			0
' i had a heavily laden bicycle that probably weighed about as much as me			0
' it was a little bit frantic , there were a good few miles i did n't look behind me and just keep pedalling			0
' as his epic journey grew bigger @entity9 's regular blogs , updating his friends and family of his adventures , gathered a devoted following			2
mr @entity9 camped under the stars on several nights , including here at @entity252 camp in @entity33 the cyclist gets off his bike as he passes as ovoo - a @entity256 cairn - in the @entity257 north of @entity258 , @entity185 he took some time out of his cycling schedule to enjoy the calm of @entity261 , @entity180 ( pictured ) through his updates he persuaded people to donate to two charities to support his adventure			1
he chose @entity266 , which supports street children in @entity268 , @entity76 , and the @entity269			0
mr @entity9 said his biggest battle during his four year challenge , was the mental battle he faced			0
he said : ' i had been travelling for a bit for a few years before and my trips got slowly more intrepid			0
i wanted to develop myself as a travel writer , so when i finished university and got a job i saved up enough to go			1
' thelast few years have certainly been tough , and often lonely but , on balance , an incredible and positive experience			0
