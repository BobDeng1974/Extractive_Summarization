but last night @entity3 picked up the pace of @entity8 life once more , heading out with boyfriend @entity13 for a date night in @entity15 wearing a stylish monochrome outfit that showed off her enviable toned legs			1
in the first public outing since their romantic trip to @entity22 before @entity23 , the couple dined at exclusive dim sum restaurant @entity24			1
@entity3 paired a short leopard sprint skirt with black boots and a cream top , shielding herself from the rain with a massive umbrella clutching her beloved @entity32 bag , @entity3 also wrapped up in a fur - trimmed jacket as she left the exclusive @entity15 restaurant despite the typically erratic @entity36 weather @entity3 opted for a short animal print skirt which she paired with sheer tights and knee length black suede boots that displayed her slim legs			1
however the 30 - year - old did wrap up against the wind and rain as she left the high - end restaurant , opting for a chic @entity45 jacket with fur by @entity47			0
obviously comfortable in @entity13 ’s company , @entity3 wore minimal make up and kept her glasses on for the meal			0
@entity13 did n't seem too bothered by the bad weather as he left the dim sum restaurant @entity3 kept her make up minimal and wore her glasses for the couple 's low key date night as with nearly every outing in the past few weeks , @entity3 was clutching her favourite £ 795 @entity59 tote by luxury leather goods brand @entity32 as she left			1
clearly a huge fan of the monochrome bag , made of @entity66 calf leather , @entity62 ’s sister is responsible for a massive surge in demand for the style , which has sold out			0
@entity3 was almost swamped by her oversized umbrella @entity13 wore a grey suit jacket over a navy jumper and white shirt @entity3 attempts to open her umbrella as she headed for the car , but seemed to struggle initially @entity3 headed to the couple 's car after the meal , where @entity13 took the driving seat as additional protection against the deluge @entity3 opened up a large black umbrella as she made a dash for the car after the meal , followed by a relaxed looking @entity13			1
seemly unperturbed by the inclement weather , the 36 - year - old stockbroker wore a grey suit jacket over a navy jumper and white polo shirt			0
also electing to wear suede on his feet despite the rain , @entity13 wore blue suede shoes and jeans			0
@entity3 was seen indulging in some retail therapy in @entity96 last week , again with her trusted tote bag despite dating for over a year and having enjoyed a number of romantic trips together the couple are rarely seen out together in their home @entity101			2
