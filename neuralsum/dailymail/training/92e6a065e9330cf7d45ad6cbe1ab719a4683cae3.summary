@entity10 ’s wednesday triumph was all the sweeter since he took home his first gold medal just minutes after his better half won a bronze			1

if i was still riding for the @entity9 , i 'd be back home with perhaps some mediocre job doing something mediocre , ’ @entity2 said after winning his first gold medal earlier this week			1

the victories are also worth about $ 250,000 to @entity10 and his wife			2
@entity32 did n't make it out of first round of elimination saturday , but it hardly mattered			1
their windfall at the @entity112 means maybe they can move out of the 300 - square foot apartment they share in @entity75			2
