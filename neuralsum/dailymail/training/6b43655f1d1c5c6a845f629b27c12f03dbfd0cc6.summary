any means necessary : residents of the summer capital @entity40 rode to relative safety on the back of a tractor , one of the few vehicles which could brave the flood patient : the only way to get around @entity40 safely is now by boat , but few are available and residents have had to wait in the upper floors of their homes rubble : survivors in @entity10 @entity2 's winter capital @entity31 were dwarfed by their damaged houses today as authorities vowed to speed up the rescue effort nothing left : the disaster has flattened thousands of homes and forced their residents to flee the area			1
