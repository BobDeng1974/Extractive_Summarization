that ’s the thing with @entity1			1
they can do it on a mild monday night in @entity4			0
that is the bad news for those betting on a white @entity7 this year			2
the good news for @entity9 and @entity1 is that they will wake up on december 25 three points clear at the top of the @entity14 table and playing like champions			1
for @entity9 , this is a very good omen			2
he has been in pole position at @entity7 on seven occasions in his managerial career , and each time he has won the title ; twice at @entity21 , @entity1 and @entity22 , once at @entity23			1
it is a stunning record			0
@entity25 slides on his knees to celebrate after his goal secured the win for @entity1 , who will be top on @entity7 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity30 6 ; @entity31 5.5 , @entity32 7 , @entity33 6 , @entity34 5.5 ; @entity35 6 , @entity36 5 ( @entity37 68 , 6 ) ; @entity38 6 , @entity39 6 , @entity40 5 ( @entity41 82 , 5.5 ) ; @entity42 5.5 ( @entity43 63 , 5.5 )			1

we are used to winners who come from down the field — and that was @entity85 ’s style under sir @entity86			0
@entity9 is different , a front - runner			1
his campaigns start well , and on monday night @entity1 looked the team to beat			2
@entity4 were disappointing , but theirs was still a robust challenge , and plenty of good teams will lose here			0
this place has n’t changed all that much from the @entity95 days , as @entity97 ’s battered legs will confirm			2
@entity4 present a significant physical challenge and it is easy to see why teams with fainter hearts have a problem here			0
at @entity104 on sunday , @entity103 could n’t find a defender who wanted to head away a 96th - minute @entity107 corner ; @entity1 often had two men jumping to make the same clearance			1
there are stronger attacking forces than @entity4 , but this was still an impressive rearguard action , seeing off a second - half bombardment			1
@entity1 scored after two minutes			1
that is a hell of a long time to defend a 1 - 0 lead away from home			0
@entity4 rode their luck , could have given away a penalty when @entity32 fouled @entity25 , and @entity1 had the best chances of the night			1
but @entity50 ’s men were still in there fighting until 12 minutes from the end			0
@entity50 upped the tempo and the ante with substitutions and every half - chance brought a mighty roar			2
@entity1 sucked it all up , and then swatted @entity4 away with a second goal to put the match beyond reach			1
fabregas made certain of victory with a goal that had a small degree of good fortune , but it was no more than he and @entity1 deserved			2
his build - up play with @entity97 was typically precise , but he took the finish off the toes of @entity61 and seemed to scuff his shot , which squirmed in at the far post			1
@entity4 had the odd shot from range but the stadium was mute and half - empty by the end			2
@entity1 are too smart and too good to lay on a grandstand finish			2
they more than had the measure of @entity4			0
the goal that set them on their way came from the first attack of the game			0
a lovely move saw @entity25 feed hazard and the ball slipped to @entity52 on the overlap , his shot charged down , but winning a corner			1
fabregas curled it in and had @entity36 kept his eyes on the delivery , he may have been in a better position to head it away			0
instead he had decided to enter @entity173 with @entity54 , in and out of hold , nice top line , @entity171 would have loved it			1
@entity54 then spoiled the routine by ignoring his partner and heading the ball past @entity30 in @entity4 ’s goal			1
@entity54 rises to beat @entity36 to the ball and give @entity1 the lead after just two minutes at the @entity181 the @entity1 captain is mobbed by his team - mates after giving his side the lead from @entity25 's corner kick @entity54 's goal was his 58th for the club and his 35th goals in the @entity14 it could have been more were it not for the unlikeliest sight — two sitters missed by the fearsome @entity61 , one in each half			1
the first came in the 32nd minute when a full - blooded tackle by the outstanding @entity57 sent the ball into the path of @entity25			1
he thought quickly and played it into @entity61 , who beat the offside trap and sped towards goal			0
at the start of the season you would have put your house on him scoring , but @entity61 steered his low finish narrowly wide of the far @entity207 second was teed up nicely by @entity59 with seven minutes remaining			2
@entity61 was spare at the far post , but @entity30 smothered			0
even factoring in these errors , it was still a mightily impressive win			0
@entity1 have the stuff of champions right now and in @entity57 , @entity25 and @entity97 three of the most important footballers in the @entity216 game			1
@entity57 was voted man of the match and understandably so given the battle in the heart of the pitch , but @entity25 is on course to break @entity224 ’s record of 20 assists in a @entity14 season , and @entity97 was simply the bravest soul out there			1
@entity4 tried to kick him into submission , and failed			0
he never stopped taking them on , never stopped probing , teasing , testing them to the limit			0
by the time his brutal treatment saw him limp down the tunnel , injury - time was being played and the match was won			2
yet @entity97 deserved better from referee @entity73 ; indeed , the same could be said for good footballers everywhere			2
@entity97 , who was a threat all night on the left wing for @entity1 , takes on @entity31 and @entity4 captain @entity32 @entity4 manager @entity50 has a well developed chip on the shoulder about the treatment his team receive from referees , but heaven knows why on this evidence			1
with 20 minutes gone , right back @entity31 was lucky to still be on the field after two poor tackles on @entity97			1
the first was a booking , the second arguably a straight red			0
@entity31 received nothing initially , and then a limp - wristed yellow from the ineffectual @entity73			1
any bad behaviour that is not stopped is encouraged , so @entity73 must take his share of the blame for the treatment @entity97 received			2
the @entity257 is a candidate for @entity259 , and @entity31 had clearly made it his mission to test his mettle			2
in the 14th minute , he went in high			0
that was the moment when @entity73 should have offered protection			0
it was a yellow - card challenge , no more , but it would have put @entity31 and @entity4 on notice			1
yet he let it go with just a free - kick and six minutes later @entity31 could have ended @entity97 ’s participation in the game , maybe even the season			1
some tackles look worse than they are			0
it looked exactly what it was : late , high , reckless , hitting @entity97 at full pelt and launching him into the air			2
@entity4 right back @entity31 badly mistimes a challenge by the touchline on @entity1 winger @entity97 hazard is sent flying by the force of the challenge from former @entity285 and @entity85 defender hazard screams after being taken out by @entity31 , who was only booked for the challenge , much to @entity9 's annoyance @entity9 remonstrates with the linesman after @entity31 was booked by refereee @entity73 @entity73 could easily have made amends for his earlier leniency			1
instead , he produced an overdue yellow			0
@entity9 looked fit to burst , so too @entity50 — although he was fortunate to still be managing 11 men			0
the pair exchanged words and @entity9 appeared to be suggesting — without irony — that @entity50 had too much to say			0
he had a point , though			0
@entity50 is a ball of discontent in the technical area , always unhappy with some perceived injustice or slight , often without cause			0
he moaned when @entity61 went down after a challenge by @entity32 , although replays showed the @entity306 striker had every reason			0
he appeared agitated when @entity31 was injured making a tackle on @entity97 , but the @entity1 man most certainly did nothing wrong			1
the play up @entity4 ’s end , @entity31 still floored , @entity97 kicked the ball into touch to allow his adversary to receive treatment			1
@entity61 is treated by @entity1 doctor @entity318 after being caught by @entity32 in an aerial challenge @entity57 ( right ) jostles for position with @entity35 as @entity1 defend a @entity4 corner @entity42 , who was ineffectual up front for @entity4 , trudges down the tunnel after being substituted in the second half @entity325 ca n't fault @entity4 performance so it was a sad indictment of @entity73 ’s officiating that he ultimately allowed the best player to be kicked out of the game			1
@entity38 ’ foul was not as blatant as @entity31 ’s assault , but he clumsily trampled on @entity97 ’s heel late on and , after a literally lame attempt at continuing , the @entity1 man signalled he could not continue			1
would @entity335 have been as wanton had @entity73 done his job sooner ? the fans who accused @entity97 of diving may feel pangs of guilt , too			0
far from being a faker , he was the most courageous player out there			0
getting kicked and going back for more : that takes guts			0
@entity25 scuffs his shot past @entity30 to double @entity1 's lead with just over 10 minutes of the match remaining @entity25 celebrates as the @entity4 defence hang their heads after the @entity352 had netted late on @entity9 embraced @entity31 at the end of the game and also shared a joke with @entity4 forward @entity39 @entity356			1

@entity54 opened scoring for @entity1 after just two minutes , heading in @entity25 's corner
@entity31 lucky to escape with just a yellow card after first - half lunge at @entity97
@entity25 added @entity1 's second with just over 10 minutes left as @entity1 maintained top spot in the table
@entity9 's side are three points clear of @entity370 and will be top on @entity7
