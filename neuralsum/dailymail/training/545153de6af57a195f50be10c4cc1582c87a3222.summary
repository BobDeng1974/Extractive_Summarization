inspector @entity33 , from @entity21 , said : ' @entity25 precinct is an area that has suffered with anti-social behaviour and criminality			2

' @entity161 , a @entity1 fan from @entity26 , came to watch the @entity73 being launched			2

' finding fame : the police telephone box has become better known as the exterior disguise for dr who 's @entity1 - pictured left in the 1970s show starring @entity177 and pictured right in the 2005 series starring @entity179 deterrent : the phone box will serve as a new police office to help the town confront anti-social behaviour retro : police phone boxes were a common sight in @entity8 in the 1920s but most were closed in the 1960s when telephones became more readily available replica : the navy blue phone box also has an a4 - sized notice on the outside - just like the @entity43 in @entity194 piece of history : an original police phone box in @entity198 , @entity199 the first ever public police telephone boxes in @entity8 were introduced in @entity201 in 1891			1
they were then brought in across the rest of the @entity8 in the 1920s so members of the public could report an emergency			1
they were designed differently to ordinary telephone boxes , as the phone was located behind a hinged door , and could be used from outside the box			2
the inside of the box was effectively a miniature police station which officers could use to collect first aid kits , pick up supplies or take down reports			0
as telephones were not readily available in the 1920s , the police phone box was a vital link between communities and their nearest police station			1
the typical police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station , allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station , reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary			0
they also normally contained a stool , a table , brushes and dusters , a fire extinguisher , and a small electric heater			0
a light on top of the box would flash to alert nearby officers that they had to contact the station			0
by 1953 there were 685 police boxes on the streets of @entity249			0
police boxes were usually blue , except in @entity201 , where they were red until the late 1960s			0
police phone boxes started to be taken out of service from the late 1960s onwards as telephones became more widely accessible and officers began carrying two - way radios rather than relying on fixed kiosks			1
today the image of the blue police box is more widely associated with @entity1 's time machine , the @entity43 , which takes the shape of a 1960s @entity8 police box .			1

@entity21 phone boxes were a common sight across @entity8 in the 1920s
but they were scrapped in the 1960s as telephones became widely available
the boxes are now better known as the disguise for dr who 's @entity1
