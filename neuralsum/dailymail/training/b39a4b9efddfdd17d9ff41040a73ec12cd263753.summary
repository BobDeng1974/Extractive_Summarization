the radical @entity1 spacecraft , designed to carry astronauts into deep space , has been given to go - ahead to launch for the first time on thursday			1
the launch has been overshadowed by two space disasters - the @entity8 rocket explosion and the tragic failure of @entity11 's @entity10			1
however , @entity12 hopes the launch could reinvigorate the space programme			2
weather conditions remain good for thursday 's @entity1 test flight , forecasters say			1
the latest predictions show there is a 60 percent chance of favorable weather for the 7:05 a.m. launch aboard a @entity30 rocket at @entity31			2
there is a 40 percent chance of violating the flight through precipitation and liftoff wind rules			0
engineers are now preparing @entity1 to launch atop 180ft tall ( 55 metres ) @entity19 rockets in an unmanned test flight on december 4th			1
@entity12 and @entity40 completed the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) for @entity1 's upcoming flight test dec. 4 , giving a ' go ' to proceed			1
the @entity41 is a rigorous assessment of the spacecraft , its systems , mission operations and support functions needed to successfully complete @entity1 's first voyage to space			1
the spacecraft is hoped to take astronauts to explore an asteroid and eventually make the 34 million mile ( 55 million km ) journey to @entity54			1
@entity12 's quest to send astronauts out into the solar system begins this week with a two - laps - around - @entity60 test flight			1
the new @entity1 spacecraft is not going to @entity54 just yet ; thursday 's debut will be unmanned and last just 4 1/2 hours			1
but it will be the farthest a built - for - humans capsule has flown since the @entity66 missions , shooting 3,600 miles out into space in order to gain enough momentum to re-enter the atmosphere at a scorching 20,000 mph			2
the dry run , if all goes well , will end with a @entity73 splashdown off @entity76 's @entity75 coast			0
navy ships will recover the capsule , a la @entity66 , for future use			0
this initial @entity1 is rigged with 1,200 sensors to gauge its durability for the day when astronauts do climb aboard during the decade ahead			2
advertised destinations include an asteroid to be corralled in lunar orbit for human exploration in the 2020s , followed by @entity54 in the 2030s			2
' we 're approaching this as pioneers , ' said @entity92 of @entity12 's exploration systems development office			1
' we 're going out to stay eventually			0
... it 's many , many decades away , but that 's our intent			0
' @entity40 built the capsule and is staging the $ 370 million test flight for @entity12			1
@entity1 is @entity12 's first new spacecraft for humans in more than a generation , succeeding the now - retired space shuttles			1
unlike the capsules under development by two @entity106 companies for space station crew transport , @entity1 is meant for the long haul , both in time and space ; it would be supplemented with habitats for potential @entity54 trips			1
' we need a spacecraft that 's going to be sturdy enough and robust enough ' to carry astronauts well beyond low - earth orbit for weeks and months at a time , said @entity40 's @entity118 , a former @entity12 shuttle flight director who will oversee @entity1 's maiden voyage			1
during its december 4 test flight , the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles ( 5,790km ) into space			1
it will then take two big laps around @entity60 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h ) and parachuting into the @entity73 off the @entity127 coast			0
the launch @entity128 and upper stage , shown in the left of this image , have been transported to @entity31			2
here , they will be joined with the @entity132 ahead of a test flight in december			1
the right image shows the stages @entity1 will go through during flight during the two - orbit , four - hour mission , engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety , the launch abort system , the heat shield and the parachute system			1
the data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models			0
the flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later @entity1 flights			2
the capsule will re-enter @entity60 's atmosphere generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees @entity155 , before splashing down in the @entity73			0
' that 's how @entity1 really separates itself from the commercial field			0
' they 're there to get you to station and back			0
of course , we 're there to be hardened enough to sustain it for that long duration			0
' for this orbital tryout , a @entity132 rocket will hoist @entity1 from @entity31			1
' liftoff is scheduled for 7:05 a.m. est , just after sunrise			0
' the rocket , with @entity1 and its launch escape tower at the tiptop , stretches 242 feet high			2
future @entity1 launches will use the mega rocket still under development by @entity12 , known as @entity175 or @entity175			1
the first @entity1 - @entity175 launch is targeted for 2018 , unmanned , followed by the first piloted mission in 2021			1
no one at @entity12 is pleased with such a poky pace			0
at best , it will be seven years before astronauts fly @entity1 - anywhere			2
by comparison , it took eight years from the time president @entity184 announced his intentions of landing a man on the moon - before @entity188 had even rocketed into orbit - to @entity190 and @entity192 's lunar boot prints in 1969			0
given the present budget situation , ' it is what it is , ' said @entity198 's director @entity197 , a former astronaut			0
and the presidential election ahead could bring further delays and uncertainties			0
in any case , do n't confuse @entity1 with @entity12 's old - time @entity66 capsules			1
for one , the 11 - foot - tall @entity1 is designed to hold four astronauts , one more than @entity66			1
for relatively short outings of three weeks or so , @entity1 could accommodate six			0
after a 22 - mile journey from the @entity207 at the @entity198 , the @entity1 arrives at @entity208 at the @entity31 , in @entity31 test flight : @entity1 will make two big laps around @entity60 before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph ( 32,200 km / h )			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of the @entity1 craft in orbit ' people often ask us , ` hey , this thing looks like a capsule , it looks like @entity66 , ' and people will confuse that with ` it 's not new , ' ' said @entity223 , @entity12 's @entity1 production operations manager			1
while physics drives the capsule 's outer bell shape , ' everything else in the capsule is state - of - the - art , ' he said			0
' everything , from the thrusters , from the environmental control systems , to the structure itself ' is benefiting from all the advances in technology , @entity223 said			0
with no one on board , this first @entity1 will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast , simulators instead of cockpit displays and , obviously , no life - support			2
the heat shield on @entity1 's base , designed to protect the craft from the searing temperatures of atmospheric re-entry , is 16.5 feet across and is the biggest , most advanced of its kind ever made , according to @entity12			1
on this flight , @entity1 will reach close to 4,000 degrees , not quite the 5,000 degrees that would be generated from a moon mission , but close enough for a shakedown			0
that 's why @entity1 will aim for a 3,600 - mile - high peak altitude , more than 14 times higher than the @entity257 - to pick up enough speed to come back fast and hot			2
@entity12 is pulling out all the stops for @entity1 's inaugural run			1
the space agency has teamed up with the nonprofit , educational @entity262 to promote not just this mission , but the effort to send astronauts to @entity54			2
comics , video and graphics are building up the countdown			0
' the astronauts of the 2030s and beyond are today 's preschoolers , ' @entity12 explains on its website			2
there 's even a new countdown clock to herald the event			0
last week , @entity198 took down its familiar launch countdown clock dating back to the @entity66 ; officials said it had become too expensive to fix and maintain			0
a new multimedia display went up in its place , just as long at 26 feet , but taller at 7 feet			0
the countdown begins : the @entity1 craft , designed to carry astronauts into deep space , as it arrived at @entity284 in @entity285 ' this is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low @entity60 orbit , ' said @entity291 , deputy associate administrator for @entity292			1
' in a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced			0
it 's thrilling to be a part of the journey now , at the beginning			0
' during the trip to @entity31 from @entity12 's @entity198 , the conical - shaped capsule was encased in its 52ft - tall ( 16 metre ) protective fairing			1
the entire transported stack - which includes the fairing , crew module and ' @entity207 ' - is 70ft tall ( 21 metres ) in total , or about the size of five double decker buses			2
when attached to the rockets , it will be around 250ft ( 76 metres )			0
last month the @entity30 rocket , built by @entity30 , made its move to nearby @entity314 at @entity31 .			0

@entity12 's @entity1 spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to an asteroid and eventually to @entity54
will be launched for first time on thursday from @entity31 in @entity285
engineers are now preparing @entity1 to launch atop a @entity19 rocket
pointed tip of the capsule is known as the @entity207 and can take astronaut 's to safety
the fairing - or casing - which aims to stream line the launch , will be *jettisoned* during @entity1 's ride into space
unmanned test flight will take place on december 4th and will take around four hours
