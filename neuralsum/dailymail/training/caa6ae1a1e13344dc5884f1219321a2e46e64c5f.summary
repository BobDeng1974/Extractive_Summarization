by @entity0 published : 03:06 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 04:18 est , 3 april 2012 he has battled raging ocean storms during a solo and unaided 2,700 mile voyage across the @entity5 and became the first disabled person to sail single - handed around @entity7 , all while confined to a wheelchair			2
having never let his disability get in the way , @entity9 was appalled when a guard told him he could not board a train because his electric wheelchair would damage the floor			1
furious mr @entity9 , 45 , said he could not recall the last time he was so upset and angry after the incident on the @entity18 's three - minute @entity17 to @entity20 service on the @entity21 on saturday			1
triumphant : @entity9 contended with storms and ferocious seas during his solo 2 - 700 mile voyage across the @entity5 to his horror , he said , ‘ in typical @entity32 fashion ’ , no passenger came to his aid as he argued with the guard			1
the unnamed guard has now been suspended pending an investigation and a senior manager has apologised , the ‘ horrified ’ train operator has confirmed			2
@entity37 also said they were investigating after mr @entity9 reported suffering cuts when ramp stored on the train was thrown onto the platform , hitting his foot and leg in the process			1
writing on his blog , the award - winning sailor , who champions disability issues and was awarded an mbe in 2010 , said : ‘ i ca n't recall the last time that i was so angry and upset i was physically shaking , emotion choking my voice , a sense of genuine rage			2
‘ so why the rage ? quite simply , a guard on the train , specifically " @entity61 " as he reluctantly identified himself when pressed , refused to let me board the 4.45pm train - the same journey i had made nine hours earlier			2
record - breaker : @entity9 became the first disabled person ever to circumnavigate @entity7 in 2007 ‘ why ? to quote guard 1003 , pointing at my wheelchair , “ those things are n't allowed on these trains , they will damage the floors ”			1
‘ i could n't quite believe what i heard and asked him to repeat it , which he did			0
‘ reminding myself this was 2012 , not 1912 , this was public transport and this was the year the @entity77 were coming to @entity7 , the red mist was descending			0
‘ expanding his fictional list of reasons why i could not travel , he then said , if he got me on this train , there was no guarantees i could get off three minutes later ( at ) the same station i had successfully travelled from earlier that morning			0
‘ trying to intimidate me , he said i might have to stay on the train to @entity86 , over 12 miles away			0
' when i said i had made the journey hours earlier , he said , and i quote : “ @entity89 , you would not have been allowed to board the train ”			0
‘ eventually , after several minutes of his posturing , huffing and puffing , guard 1003 lifted the tiny ramp stored on the train and , quite literally , threw it on the platform , hitting my foot and leg in the process ( when i got home , i found it was grazed and bleeding , i did not know this at the time because i ca n't feel it )			2
determined : @entity9 competed in the @entity104 in a @entity105 despite being disabled in a swimming accident that left him handicapped ‘ and with that simple , easy manoeuvre , which took him only 10 seconds , i was on the train , @entity61 snarling at me like some prison guard			1
all the other passengers looked on in disbelief but , in typical @entity32 fashion did nothing			0
’ mr @entity9 has been in a wheelchair since a swimming accident 28 years ago in the @entity117 and he completed his 2,700 - mile transatlantic sail in 2010 finishing at the site of his 1984 accident			1
the father - of - one added : ‘ he had publicly humiliated me , he had publicly degraded me and he had made me feel like a worthless piece of dirt ... it was quite simply the most disgusting way to treat another human being , let alone a disabled one			0
’ @entity18 refused to confirm that ' @entity61 ' - as identified by mr @entity9 - had been suspended			1
but a spokesman said : ‘ we are absolutely horrified at the events mr @entity9 has described			1
we welcome electric wheelchairs on our services and it is very important to us that all of our passengers feel welcome on our network			0
‘ we are taking this matter very seriously and have already launched an investigation			0
a senior manager has contacted mr @entity9 directly to apologise			1
‘ we can also confirm that one of our employees has been suspended while our investigation is under way			0
