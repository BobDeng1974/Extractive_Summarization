by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 20:00 est , 26 july 2012 when medal winner @entity2 scooped gold at the last @entity4 over half a century ago , the event was a far cry from the all - encompassing , multi-billion pound ' @entity7 on @entity8 ' it is today			1
now 64 years after the capital last hosted the @entity13 , @entity11 's only surviving gold medal winner has described how it felt competing in the first post-war @entity4 in 1948			1
sporting hero mr @entity2 , now 90 , claimed gold as one half of the @entity18 class sailing team - having taken unpaid leave from work to compete in the @entity13 his bosses barely cared about			1
proud : mr @entity2 , now 90 , pictured with his gold medal from 1948 , said he had to take unpaid leave to participate in the last @entity13 victorious : mr @entity2 and his sailing teammate @entity24 receive their gold medals by sir @entity27 and in stark contrast to the fever pitch surrounding @entity4 , he told how holidaymakers in @entity11 did not even know the @entity4 were on at all			1
mr @entity2 , also known as ' dinghy ' , forged an unbeatable partnership with @entity33 , originally from @entity34 , who passed away in 1991			2
@entity36 : mr @entity2 , pictured with teammate @entity24 , told how @entity11 holidaymakers in 1948 did not even know the @entity13 were going on as he was a genuine amateur , he had to take unpaid leave from work to practice , with his employers paying no interest in his activity			1
the gold medallist , who now spends most of his time between living in @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity47 , said : ' the participants are now professionals - they work full - time on improving their sport whereas in 1948 participants were amateurs			2
' you practised your sport after work and at weekends and you funded yourself			0
there was n't any sponsorship			0
' i took unpaid leave from my job in the aircraft industry to take part in the games and my employers were n't the slightest bit interested in why i wanted the leave			0
' @entity2 was born and brought up in @entity46 by his father who was also a sailing enthusiast , but unfortunately died of cancer in 1940 - eight years before his son won gold			1
he did n't even know he would be competing in the games until march 1948 , less than three months before the start			0
@entity2 is now preparing to watch the great @entity11 hopefuls at the @entity4 gets into full flow this weekend			1
however , the build - up to the games is a far cry to what he was used to back in 1948			2
he said : ' there was very little atmosphere in anticipation of the @entity4 in 1948 but it was a very different time then			0
' there were a number of battleships manning the harbour and the @entity4 were such an under reported local story that holidaymakers on the seaside were heard to ask : ' who are all these young people from different countries and why are they here ? ' mr @entity2 , from @entity46 , @entity47 , is now as excited as the rest of the nation for the start of the @entity4 spectacle : the @entity4 , in which mr @entity2 took part in the sailing , were a far cry from the billion pound global event that will be @entity4 priceless : mr @entity2 still fondly cherishes his gold medal from the @entity99 ' the other difference was the lack of media in 1948			1
' there was n't internet , tv , a wide range of newspapers or any of the multimedia sources there are today			0
so people were n't really aware of the games			0
' i did n't even know i was taking part until march 1948			0
so it was a very different approach then , although equally competitive			0
' there was no media interest worth talking about			0
in 1948 the @entity118 gave half a page a day or less to the sailing at @entity121 - it was the only paper to do anything at all			2
' a different era : mr @entity2 's uniform and pass for the 1948 games show just how much the event has changed since the last time @entity127 hosted winning team : mr @entity2 and teammate @entity24 won gold in the @entity131 sailing event			1

@entity2 , 90 , was one half of medal - winning sailing team 64 years ago
he tells how holidaymakers in @entity11 did not even know 1948 @entity13 were going on
