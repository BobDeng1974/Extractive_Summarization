by @entity0 for @entity1 a pensioner just weeks from her 70th birthday is a real high flyer ... but we 're not talking about her career			2
at the age of 69 @entity8 , from @entity9 , has long since retired from her job in financial services			1
these days the pensioner likes nothing better than swinging from a trapeze at circus school			1
@entity8 , 69 , a trapeze artist with no fit state circus , and likes nothing better than throwing herself around while many elderly people would n't dream of such daring exploits for fear of the physical demands required , @entity8 is something of an anomaly - and that 's just the way she likes it			1
she attends circus skills classes at the hq of world - renowned @entity9 - based @entity29 twice a week			1
' i started circus skills and aerial work , which is my favourite , just before turning 50 , ' she recalls			1
related ] ' i saw an advert in @entity36 for a trapeze class run by @entity38 who had been going for about eight years by then			2
' it was a class for children , so i called and said , " i 'm a 50 - year - old adult "			2
' there was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line , but the instructor said there were only 14 spaces , so we should wait and see if all the spaces got taken up			2
' @entity8 attends circus skills classes at the hq of @entity9 - based @entity29 twice a week as luck would have it , @entity8 received a call to partake in the class - and when she arrived the only other adults there were parents ready to watch their children pick up circus tricks			1
' i squatted on the floor with the other children and the instructor said , " i wondered if you were going to look like an old granny "			0
coming from anyone else , that would have been rude , but it was so funny			0
' it was a very hard class , but such fun			0
exercising with young people was and is still very liberating			0
' hanging upside down from ropes might not be every pensioner 's idea of fun , however @entity8 's agility has come as no surprise to her friends and family			1
she took up rollerblading at 55 and there are plenty of other adventures she would like to have a go at before she thinks of winding down			0
her husband @entity86 - with whom she celebrated 50 years of marriage this year - gets a similar thrill from surfing and windsurfing			0
@entity8 says exercising with young people was and is still very liberating as a child growing up in the @entity91 , @entity8 longed to do gymnastics , but did n't have much opportunity to partake in her passions - instead she took piano lessons at the insistence of her father			1
however , it was when she hit 40 that her life took a turn			0
an article about cancer patients had a profound emotional impact and made @entity8 realise it was time she started looking after herself , taking care of her body and fitness			2
now retired , @entity8 , who begins her eighth century in november , regularly goes to the gym - when she 's not flying on a trapeze of course			1
she has also practised yoga for years and with regular swimming and running , exercises up to five times a week			2
and for the future ? well she 's going to keep on keeping on			0
to this inspirational woman , age really is just a number			0
' many people think that just because they 're getting old that should stop them from exercising			0
i 'm proof that if you look after yourself , you can achieve whatever you want			0
