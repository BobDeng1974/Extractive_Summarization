@entity20 players are normally too proud to do that unlike our foreign friends			1
' for instance , ( @entity61 ) @entity60 would come in some days ( at @entity63 ) and sit on the massage bed while the team trained ... " i 'm tired ... match day - firing & energised			0
' either some real dumb heads on here or they just missed the point totally			0
doing what 's better for the team & yourself long term ... ' with more rest at the right times throughout seasons ( @entity48 ) @entity48 would have gone into tournaments for @entity8 fresher 100 % ... too proud again			1
' same could be said of ( @entity80 ) @entity79 , ( @entity82 ) @entity81 , @entity83 ( @entity83 ) , @entity84 , myself , etc. - all too proud to set out of training or a match with the bigger picture in mind			0

' yesterday we trained but @entity2 was complaining a little about being tired and was not at his best			2
so we wo n't risk him and @entity50 is in fine form , ' @entity15 told @entity110 before the game			0
' we can use him as a sub			0
@entity50 was very good against @entity96 and interpreted the role behind the two attackers very well			1
' they are different types of players and both feature strongly			0

that 's nice to know			0
