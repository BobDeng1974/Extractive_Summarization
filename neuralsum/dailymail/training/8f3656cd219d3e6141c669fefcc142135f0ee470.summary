by @entity0 published : 06:18 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 30 may 2013 why not carry your essentials around with you in a jam jar , a giant felt @entity5 , or even @entity7 piano ? for those struggling to make a statement with their bag , a new and slightly out - there range of made - to - order bags will certainly set you apart			1
the brain child of @entity18 brand krukrustudio , who describe the bags as ‘ bag - objects ’ fashion , their creations are mainly made out of felt and wool			1
@entity26 bag : this might look like an average pot of strawberry jam , but it is in fact a rather unique handbag it 's a knockout : a bag in the shape of a boxing glove , left , and a @entity37 from @entity38 style solved : the eye - catching @entity5 bag is made of @entity43 felt and costs £ 98.89 out to play : the @entity5 cube bag in action , left , along with a ' house of cards ' bag , which opens at the ' roof ' ah , the humble carrot , so much more than just a vegetable : as @entity52 studios prove , it can also inspire a clutch bag , £ 105.71 time on your side : let everyone you pass in the street know just how cultured you are , with a @entity59 bag , left , or violin backpack get patriotic : this number in the shape of a @entity64 bus costs £ 64.79 from a giant boxing glove and an @entity70 to a violin , a dalek from @entity38 and even the @entity67 logo , the bags come in every conceivable design			2
barely a day goes by without another ‘ it ’ handbag being announced or seen on the arms of numerous celebrities			0
but with most of these costing thousands of pounds and acquiring a waiting list months long , it can be difficult to feel original			0
so the customised ‘ carrot ’ bag or blueberry jam bag with a lid opening is one way to get noticed			0
picture perfect : this @entity67 logo bag could be an ironic statement about social media - or simple somewhere to keep your lippy , £ 64.79 express your love of the outdoors with either a hot air balloon bag ( it unzips down the centre ) or a traditional green watering can number , left a quirky gift for a pianist : this @entity7 piano bag even unzips as if you were opening up the piano lid , and has three tiny pedals time for tea : though be careful as the brand point out that while felt is slightly water resistant , it is most definitely not waterproof c'est chic : the @entity70 bag , left , is made with silver washable print and grey felt insets , while the ' jam ' bag also comes in @entity110 and @entity112 ' flavours ' the @entity18 pair behind the brand @entity115 and @entity116 started selling their designs in @entity119 in march 2011 and now sell internationally			1
most of their bags can be customised in a variety of colours and cost anywhere from around £ 60 - £ 120 online .			0
