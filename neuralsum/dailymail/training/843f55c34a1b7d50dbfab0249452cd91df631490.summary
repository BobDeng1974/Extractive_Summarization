by @entity0 the @entity1 rejected a campaign to erect a statue of @entity4 outside @entity5 in @entity6 because the author was ' too left - wing '			1

inspirational : @entity4 ( real name @entity4 ) , worked for the @entity1 during @entity11 before leaving to publish @entity26 and 1984 @entity4 produced radio programmes at @entity5 during @entity11 , before leaving to write @entity26 and dystopian masterpiece 1984			1
@entity29 , writing in the @entity31 , said she put the idea to mr @entity22 in a meeting earlier this year			2
campaign : baroness @entity17 is leading the campaign for a statue of @entity4 she said : ' i met @entity22 at a @entity1 reception and mentioned the project			1
' he said , ' oh no , @entity17 , we ca n’t possibly			0
it ’s far too left - wing an idea			1
' mr @entity22 has been appointed chief executive of the @entity43 , which publishes the @entity44 , and will hand over to new @entity1 director general @entity45 next month			1
the campaign to honour @entity4 outside @entity5 has raised more than £ 60,000 and gained the support of currently - serving journalists including @entity49 and @entity50			0
the @entity1 confirmed that plans for a statue in the piazza outside @entity5 had been turned down , saying the area already houses @entity56 ’s £ 1.6million work world			0
a spokesperson for the @entity58 added that there were plans to put the @entity4 statue on a nearby site in @entity63 , which does not belong to the @entity1			2
a spokesperson said : ' we can not put the statue immediately outside @entity5 as the @entity1 piazza already has artwork by @entity56 built into the pavement which would be obscured			0
' we are , however , working with @entity71 city council and those involved with the statue to find an appropriate location nearby			0
' the statue was commissioned by the @entity76 run by @entity77 , a former @entity78 politician			0

@entity4 first started working at the @entity1 in 1941 , working as a @entity58 's @entity82			2
he initially supervised broadcasts to @entity84 designed to counteract @entity86 propaganda , working full time for the @entity1 until 1943			0
@entity88 , the sculptor commissioned to create it , told the @entity31 : ' @entity4 is regarded as something of a patron saint of political journalism so his presence near the @entity1 could surely act as some kind of inspiration to all independent - minded broadcasters			2
' fans of @entity4 may want to remind @entity22 of the hatred felt by many on the @entity101 towards the author after his searing condemnation of @entity104 in @entity26 and 1984			2
early in his career , @entity4 certainly harboured disgust with aspects of imperialism and capitalism			0
but these views changed dramatically during the @entity111 when he was caught up in a bloody purge by @entity116 's increasingly @entity115 - controlled @entity114 government			0
writing on @entity119 , @entity118 columnist @entity117 said : ' the experience of being hunted by the secret police and seeing his comrades arrested , tortured and killed by the @entity116 stalinists and their @entity125 bosses gave @entity4 an abiding horror of @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity130 's many @entity20 apologists - including his own publisher , @entity131 , who refused to publish @entity4 's account of his @entity116 experiences " @entity134 " for fear of upsetting the @entity115			0
' @entity4 saw what horrors could be committed in the name of ' socialism ' and , although he did quit the @entity1 during the war to become literary editor of left - wing tribune magazine , he went on to publish the dystopian novels @entity26 and 1984 , the most cutting indictments of @entity145 totalitarianism ever written			1
mr @entity117 said : ' a doughty warrior in the cause of liberty , free thought and political prose as clear as a glass pane , @entity4 deserves his statue all right - but on second thoughts perhaps @entity22 is right			1
' today 's @entity1 - aka the @entity154 ( from 1984 ) - might not be the best place for it after all			0
