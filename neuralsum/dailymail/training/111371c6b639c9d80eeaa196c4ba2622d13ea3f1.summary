@entity0 knew the importance of his no 9			1
when @entity4 's late penalty nestled into @entity6 ' net , the @entity8 manager span , roared at the home dugout and celebrated with his staff			1
' i do n't want to sound big - headed but not many teams come here and get a draw			1
nobody are favourites except @entity16 , ' was the manager 's assessment			2
once @entity4 trudged off after the final whistle of a game the visitors really ought to have won , @entity0 was the first to embrace the striker with a man hug			1
it told all those at the bottom of the @entity27 just what the @entity28 think of their new man			0
@entity8 ' @entity4 scores the 1 - 1 equaliser from the penalty spot against @entity16 goalkeeper @entity6 the 2,800 travelling supporters went wild - a solitary flare was let off - as @entity8 earned a 1 - 1 draw @entity0 of @entity8 looks on during the @entity37 match against @entity16 which ended 1 - 1 @entity38 a potential return to the @entity40 may be something under - fire manager @entity43 at @entity45 regret			1
@entity16 after @entity4 's showing at @entity47 compared to @entity48 , @entity16 may wish they 'd went in for the @entity50 striker			1
@entity51 stuck with @entity52 for £ 16million , @entity4 cost @entity8 half that amount			1
did @entity51 miss a trick in letting @entity4 leave @entity55 ? @entity56 another potential return that could have seen @entity58 go a long way to keeping his promise of more attractive football			2
@entity62 @entity63 and @entity64 from @entity65 to @entity62 have proved successful buys so far , and @entity4 could have been the third			2
by @entity68 back in @entity55 for the second time since leaving @entity65 in the summer , the 29 - year - old played as if he had something to prove			2
to the @entity73 , definitely			0
he strutted around @entity47 as if there was only one man to settle this game			2
only a string of @entity6 saves stopped @entity0 and @entity4 would have been leaving with three precious points , almost sealing their qualification from the group in turn already			1
in the end , it was left for the @entity86 to grab a point			0
on an evening he stood above the rest , that finale seemed fitting			0
the 2,800 travelling supporters went wild - a solitary flare was let off - as @entity8 , knowing the @entity37 is a gateway to @entity95 qualification for first time this season , earned the least they deserved			1
@entity0 , when referencing the swell of support in the @entity101 corner , joked afterwards that he wished there were as many fans in @entity104 as there are in @entity106			2
tricky to blame him given the noise projected from that area of the ground well before kick - off			0
they had been allowed in particularly early on thursday night - a wise move after the scenes around the @entity114 the night before - and it filled up rather quickly			0
with an hour to go there were at least 1,500 already out in their seats chanting away			0
that would give any team a lift			0
there they were , hollered on to their warm up - similarly so when the @entity126 came out half - an - hour later			0
@entity4 thrived and meant business			0
@entity4 was pumped up , thrashing an arm towards @entity129 in the opening minutes and being cautioned @entity4 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity132 during the @entity37 match against @entity16 @entity8 ' @entity4 reacts after missing a chance during the @entity37 tie but the striker got a goal in the end @entity4 bags fifth goal in six games against @entity16 as @entity16 are held and @entity142 watches his old club he was pumped up , thrashing an arm towards @entity129 in the opening minutes and being handed a relatively harsh booking			1
that knock riled @entity16 , from which their back four never really recovered			0
there is a sense of mystery surrounding why @entity151 opted to allow @entity4 to leave @entity152 in the summer in favour of splashing £ 8.5million @entity154 - for all his goalscoring prowess - does n't impose himself on matches in quite the same way			1
@entity4 's mere presence had the @entity16 central two scared of playing too high a line for fear of being caught in behind , while they were consistently beaten in the air			1
@entity0 of @entity8 with @entity16 manager @entity164 after the pair took a point apiece on thursday the next @entity37 fixtures will be shown on @entity167 1 , @entity167 and @entity168 ! if all else fails , watch the highlights on @entity170 by clicking here ! with that said , @entity164 will see this as a point gained on the road to @entity175			1
@entity16 were nowhere near touching their best - not surprising given the manager had made 10 changes - and , but for @entity6 , might have come away with nothing			1
they missed something going forward , often lackadaisical in their approach and did n't have a focal point to hit			0
@entity182 offered when dropping deeper into the no 10 but the consistent beige produced by @entity48 must continue to concern			0
@entity164 said afterwards that he had ' all the information ' needed on the players in his squad after three months working with them			0
a modern day target man in @entity4 's mould ca n't be far from topping the january wishlist			2
