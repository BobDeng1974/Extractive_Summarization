by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 04:24 est , 1 march 2014 @entity3 sold more than $ 1 billion of @entity5 set - top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products , boss @entity2 said at the company 's annual meeting today			1
the firm is believed to be working on a range of tv sets alongside an improved version of its current $ 99 tv box			0
future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live tv as well as buy movies and tv shows			0
@entity3 's current $ 99 tv box , which the firm revealed today has made it over $ 1bn rumours claim that @entity3 's tv set will use a @entity28 screen making is far sharper than even current hdtv pictures			1
the firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live tv as well as but films ans tv shows			0
it is also expected to be able to run apps , and work with an @entity38 or @entity39 as a remote control			0
@entity3 's ability to again transform the fast - moving technology arena is the central question in investors ' and @entity49 executives ' minds as the company 's growth slows , and rivals like @entity51 and @entity52 take chunks out of its market share			2
industry executives and @entity3 observers continue to believe that the company will come up with some sort of wearable device , like a smartwatch , and speculation persists about a long - rumored tv product of some sort to shake up the living room viewing experience			1
' we 're working on some things that are extensions of things you can see and some that you ca n't see , ' @entity2 said at the annual meeting , referring to a 32 percent increase in research and development costs last year			2
responding to a question about innovation , @entity2 said @entity3 preferred not to talk about new products under development so as not to tip off the competition			1
' you can see we 're getting ripped off left , right and sideways , ' he said			0
@entity3 's shares fell 0.27 percent to close at $ 526.24 on friday			2
they have clawed back substantial ground since falling below $ 400 in june , but remain well below the record - high $ 700 level of 2012 , weighed by concerns about whether the company has any new hit products in the pipeline			0
though @entity2 steered clear of that discussion , he shed some more light on the @entity3 tv business , which executives have long referred to as a ' hobby ' for a company expected to chalk up some $ 181 billion in sales this fiscal year			1
ceo @entity2 also slammed @entity94 for security problems , and warned short term investor not to buy stock the $ 99 @entity5 set - top box , which streams content from @entity100 and other video sources to a tv , had racked up $ 1 billion in sales in the past year , he said			1
' it 's a little more difficult to call it a hobby these days , ' @entity2 said			1
@entity2 took pot shots at @entity52 , saying that most users of its @entity94 mobile operating system are using older versions , presenting a security threat			1
in contrast , he said , 89 percent of users of devices based on @entity3 's @entity115 operating system have the most recent version of the software			2
shareholders at the annual meeting at @entity3 's @entity121 , @entity122 , headquarters re-elected all board members			2
in the run - up to the meeting at 1 @entity127 , many investors had publicly debated whether @entity3 should not put any of its massive cash pile to better use			2
@entity2 said the company will provide an update within 60 days on how it will use the cash , which totaled nearly $ 160 billion at the end of 2013			0
that time frame is in line with @entity3 's previous comments that it would announce its latest cash management plans around april			0
@entity52 also has its eye on the tv market , and recently launched the @entity142 , a $ 39 dongle to give any tv online capabilities @entity3 repurchased $ 14 billion in stock in a two - week period earlier this year , under pressure from activist investor @entity147 , who had been publicly calling for the iphone - maker to buy back an additional $ 50 billion of stock on top of its existing buyback program			1
the billionaire investor , who in late january said he held more than $ 4 billion of @entity3 shares , withdrew his shareholder proposal following @entity3 's announcement of the buyback			0
some analysts believe @entity3 may eventually dip into its coffers to buy something big			0
the @entity39 maker has so far shied away from the mega-acquisitions that far more aggressive rivals like @entity52 and @entity166 have pursued , though @entity2 did not rule out forking over a big sum of cash if warranted			0
@entity2 said @entity3 has acquired 23 companies in the last 16 months and remained on the lookout for interesting technology and companies			1
@entity3 is not in a race to acquire the most companies or to spend the most money , but that ' does n't mean we wo n't buy a huge company tomorrow afternoon , ' he said			1
and he warned shareholders not to focus too narrowly on short - term gains			0
' if you 're in @entity3 for only a week ... or two months , i would encourage you not to invest in @entity3 , ' he said			1
' we are here for the long term			0
