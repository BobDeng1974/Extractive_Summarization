after his golden season , @entity0 is experiencing the flip - side of acclaim and recognition			1
he is striving to live up to that sustained near - perfection and finding it frustrating			2
raised and distorted expectations are the issue for @entity11 ’ @entity10 full back , who believes that his game continues to improve			1
the peaks of 2013 - 14 featured endless tries and awards and fanfare for his work in the @entity10 no 15 shirt he had always craved			1
the 29 - year - old became seemingly untouchable as the national team ’s last line of defence			1
@entity0 celebrates after scoring the first try against @entity27 in the @entity28 last year @entity0 ( bottom centre ) drives forward with the ball for @entity32 side harlequins @entity0 runs with the ball during the @entity35 match between @entity10 and @entity36 in november he was named @entity37 , @entity10 ’s player of the @entity35 autumn series and @entity28 @entity40			1
he was identified by the @entity36 as the key threat to their home rule last june			0
but this season , @entity0 has not been feted in the same way			1
with @entity11 blowing hot and cold and @entity10 stumbling through their november campaign , his every isolated error has been identified as proof that the spell has been broken			1
he can sense murmurs of doubt , but points to a shift in his job description and his profile , which has diminished his freedom to run amok			0
‘ i ’m pretty happy with how i ’m playing , ’ he said			0
‘ i think my game is a lot more rounded than it was last year and i have a different role this season , especially with @entity11			1
i ’ve been playing more as a distributor — putting others into gaps , which is frustrating at times because my strength is my running game			2
i ’ve been doing more kicking , too			0
‘ i feel like more of a marked man this year , but that creates more space for other people			2
as long as i ’m making the correct decisions about when to pass and when to run , that ’s good			0
i think i ’m still playing at that same high level ; it ’s just that people focus on the flashy stuff			0
@entity0 ( right ) tries to hold off the challenge of @entity77 ' @entity76 during the @entity78 @entity0 ( centre ) , pictured in action against @entity81 , was named @entity10 's player of the @entity35 series @entity0 attempts to evade the challenge of @entity85 during match against @entity36 in november ‘ people expect me to be making those long breaks and scoring tries in every game now , but there ’s so much more to rugby			1
i ’m working hard and improving in other areas			0
if i was n’t , i certainly would n’t be starting @entity10 games			2
’ @entity0 has all the self - belief associated with a run of 17 consecutive starts at full back for @entity10 , after spending time filling in on the wing			1
nevertheless , he is alert to speculation about selection , with @entity102 of @entity103 continuing to pressurise him and many observers championing @entity105 until he suffered a season - ending knee injury			2
‘ once a player gets to a certain level and gets talked up , there ’s always going to be chat about how they are performing , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ look at @entity112 and how often he gets it — about who should be playing instead of him			0
then he puts in another top performance			0
‘ it creates a debate , but i ca n’t really look at that			0
i just have to get on with it			0
’ having spent so many years striving for his @entity121 breakthrough , @entity0 has no intention of tamely allowing a challenger to usurp him — particularly in this momentous year of a home @entity124			1
@entity10 international @entity0 ( centre ) is an ambassador for the @entity129 wheelchair rugby team @entity0 pictured with @entity130 ( left ) , @entity131 ( centre ) and @entity133 ( right ) ‘ there ’s no way i ’m going to take my foot off the gas now , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s such an important year and hopefully i keep getting selected			0
i ’m trying to show that my game is more rounded , even if some people do n’t want to see it ! i ’m sure the coaches recognise what i ’m doing			0
’ when he is back on @entity10 duty again next week , the focus will be to prepare for a return to @entity147 , where a @entity149 crusade was buried under an avalanche of @entity152 points in the record 30 - 3 defeat two years ago			2
@entity0 recalls the fervent atmosphere in the @entity155 that day and the fact that @entity10 were in the hunt for longer than the scoreline suggests			2
@entity160 ’s men have finished runners - up in the @entity28 for the last three seasons and as the arch - competitor , @entity0 wo n’t settle for that			1
‘ we ’re an ambitious squad and we want to win it this year , ’ he said			0
on saturday , @entity0 will hope that he and the rest of @entity11 ’ international contingent can lead the way in putting @entity170 to the sword in @entity172 , in the faint hope that it will lead to a place in the last eight of the @entity78			1
he will be desperate to come through unscathed , to resume his attempts to live up to heightened expectations , in the national cause			0
@entity0 is an ambassador for the @entity180 team , who have announced plans for an eight - team tournament at @entity184 during the @entity124			1
their new three - year partnership with @entity187 is designed to grow the game in the build up to @entity190 and beyond			1
