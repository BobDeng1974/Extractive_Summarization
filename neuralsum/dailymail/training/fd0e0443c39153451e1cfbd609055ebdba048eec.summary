by @entity0 a meteorologist for @entity4 affiliate @entity3 in @entity5 , @entity1 recently received some rather unwelcome fashion advice from an elderly viewer in a handwritten letter			1
the letter tells @entity10 that while she 's a ' great meterologist [ sic ] , ' she would get a lot more compliments if she did n't wear ' those high bodice dresses			1
' the letter - writer left no return address , so @entity10 posted the letter on her @entity19 page along with a polite but firm response to the advice therein			1
weathering the storm : @entity10 says that after 12 years on - air , she 's realized she 'll never please everyone with her appearance unsolicited : in a letter apparently penned at 2am , an ' elderly person ' told @entity10 not to wear dresses that ' fight snugly ' under her bust the letter begins by complimenting @entity10 at her proficiency at her job but quickly gets to the point : @entity10 's appearance			1
' please change your appearance ! ' reads the letter from someone who describes themselves as an ' elderly person			1
' ' do you have any dress or dresses that do n't fit snugly under your ( @entity42 ) ? please ! you are beautiful – but you need a change , ' it goes on			1
@entity10 , rightfully , was annoyed at the unsolicited fashion advice			1
accurate forecast : @entity10 says that if she knew people would value her more for her appearance than her work she could have saved a lot on her meteorology degree ' does the fact that i bring an accurate forecast mean nothing ? i was a straight a student			1
if i had known being on @entity58 's list of " best dressed " mattered more than an accurate forecast , i could 've saved a ton of money on that meteorology degree , ' she writes			2
the @entity3 meteorologist has been on - air for 12 years and says she 's tried to change herself to please other people before , and that she 's realized it 's pointless			1
' i will never , ever be able to please everyone with my appearance , ' she writes			2
' i have " changed my appearance " to try to please people before			0
so , i please myself			0
i feel good about my appearance			0
i am always covered , dressed modestly and professionally			0
' as @entity10 points out , commenting on other people 's appearance is ' very rude			1
' viewer letter : hello @entity74 [ sic ] , you are a great meterologist [ sic ] ! i am at [ sic ] elderly person who depends on @entity77 for my daily news and weather – my daily beginnings – i watch this news from 2 a.m. – thru the day			1
i observed every one gets great compliments about their job , how they give great forecast [ sic ]			0
there are not any compliments about you ! why ? please change your appearance ! ! those high bodice dresses are not ( for ) you			0
do you have any dress or dresses that do n't fit snugly under your ( @entity42 ) ? please ! you are beautiful – but you need a change			1
please do n't feel like i 'm putting you down			2
this letter is meant for the beautiful lady you are			2
go forward ( be happy ! ) @entity10 's response : so , it 's not fun to wake up to things like this			1
no return address was left , so i 'll address it here			0
i will never , ever be able to please everyone with my appearance			0
i have tried for 12 years on - air to do that			0
i have " changed my appearance " to try to please people before			0
so , i please myself			0
i feel good about my appearance			0
i am always covered , dressed modestly and professionally			0
yet , she mentions that i am a great meteorologist ! and she also says i get " no compliments " ? does the fact that i bring an accurate forecast mean nothing ? i was a straight a student			2
if i had known being on @entity58 's list of " best dressed " mattered more than an accurate forecast , i could 've saved a ton of money on that meteorology @entity120 n't do this , people			2
that 's my opinion , and it is as valuable as anyone else 's opinion .			0
