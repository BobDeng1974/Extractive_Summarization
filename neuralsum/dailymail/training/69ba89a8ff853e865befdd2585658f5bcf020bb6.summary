by @entity0 last updated at 7:28 am on 27th january 2012 defiant : @entity1 has hinted it could reopen talks with the @entity3 , but president @entity4 insists it will not give up its nuclear ambitions @entity1 has indicated it is ready to revive talks with the @entity3 as @entity7 cedes ground in the face of toughened sanctions			1
president @entity4 has insisted international pressure will not force @entity1 to give up its demands , including the continuing enrichment of uranium , which forced the collapse of dialogue last year			1
but a senior @entity18 nuclear agency team is expected to visit @entity7 on saturday - the first since a report in november that alleged @entity1 was on the brink of developing a nuclear weapon			1
the @entity23 and @entity24 allies want @entity1 to stop making nuclear fuel , which they worry could lead to weapons - grade material and the production of nuclear weapons			2
@entity1 has always claimed its programme is for peaceful purposes - generating electricity and producing medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients			0
the 27 - member @entity35 imposed an oil embargo on @entity1 on monday , part of sanctions aimed at squeezing @entity7 into resuming talks on the nuclear programme			1
it follows @entity23 action aimed at limiting the country 's ability to sell oil , which accounts for 80 per cent of @entity1 's foreign revenue			1
suspicions : technicians work at the reactor building at @entity51 nuclear power plant , 750 miles south of @entity7			1
@entity1 has always insisted its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes secretive : mr @entity4 at the @entity54 nuclear plant in 2007			2
a report by the @entity56 last year indicated @entity1 was developing nuclear weapons no date has been set for a possible resumption between @entity1 and the five permanent @entity61 members , as well as @entity62			0
negotiations ended in stalemate in january last year , and @entity1 later rejected a plan to send its stockpile of low - enriched uranium abroad in exchange for reactor - ready fuel rods			2
mr @entity4 has accused the @entity3 of trying to scuttle the negotiations			0
he said : ' it is you who come up with excuses each time and issue resolutions on the verge of talks so that negotiations collapse			0
' why should we shun talks ? why and how should a party that has logic and is right shun talks ? ' it is evident that those who resort to coercion are opposed to talks and always bring pretexts and blame us instead			0
' security : a satellite image of @entity93 - a restricted area in @entity7 - which was completely dismantled after it was suspected of harbouring missile equipment a delegation from the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) will be led by deputy director general @entity97 , who is in charge of the @entity1 nuclear file			1
@entity1 began uranium enrichment at a new underground site built to withstand possible airstrikes earlier this month , in another show of defiance against @entity106 pressure to rein in its nuclear programme			1
centrifuges at the bunker - like @entity110 facility near @entity1 's holy city of @entity112 are churning out uranium enriched to 20 per cent			0
that level is higher than the 3.5 per cent being made at @entity1 's main enrichment plant at @entity54 , central @entity1 , and can be turned into warhead material faster and with less work			0
@entity1 says it wo n't give up its right to enrich uranium and produce nuclear fuel , but it has offered to allow the @entity56 inspectors to visit its nuclear sites to ensure that its programme wo n't be weaponised			2
the nuclear programme has been the target of covert @entity106 operations , believed to have been carried out by @entity127 's @entity126			0
four nuclear scientists have been killed in the last two years there , and there have also been mysterious explosions at nuclear facilities			1
mr @entity4 also said sanctions and oil embargo will backfire because it has minimum trade with @entity35			1
' @entity23 have not purchased @entity1 oil for 30 years			0
our central bank has had no dealings with them ... our ( total ) foreign trade is about $ 200 billion			0
' between $ 23billion to $ 24billion of our trade is with @entity24 , making up about 10 per cent of our total trade ... @entity1 wo n't suffer , ' he said			0
the @entity35 had been importing about 450,000 barrels of oil a day from @entity1 , making up 18 per cent of @entity1 's oil exports .			2

talks broke down in january 2011 over *refusal* to stop uranium enrichment
@entity35 *stepped* up sanctions on @entity7 , including oil embargo aimed at squeezing *regime*
inspectors *due* to arrive in country no saturday to view nuclear facilities
