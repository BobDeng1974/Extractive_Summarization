by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:40 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 18:18 est , 22 december 2012 church leaders have warned that @entity3 is in danger of becoming a ‘ frenzy of bargain hunting ’ after @entity5 announced it is launching its sale on december 25			2
online retailers expect an astonishing £ 307 million of business on tuesday alone – 50 per cent more than an average day			1
critics have called for the sales to be postponed until @entity13 , leaving @entity3 as a family occasion and religious celebration			1
unheard of : @entity5 has announced that it will be launching its sale on christmas day to the anger of church leaders however , after a disappointing december , many retailers desperate to clear their stock have decided to unveil their sales a day early			1
a huge proportion of the 42 million @entity23 who shop online are likely to log on , dwarfing the 2.3 million expected at @entity3 services , including @entity25 most controversially , the biggest retailer , @entity5 – already under fire for avoiding @entity23 tax on its estimated £ 3 billion annual sales – will begin listing bargains from 9am on christmas morning			1
alongside discounted stock will be ‘ @entity32 ’ – limited offers throughout the day , which are likely to pose a distraction from unwrapping presents			1
high street chains in the online rush include @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , all of whose sales begin on @entity46 or @entity3			1
however , many have already begun to offer major discounts in shops and online			1
' it never stops ' : @entity5 ( warehouse pictured ) - already under fire for avoiding @entity23 tax - will begin listing bargains from 9am on december 25 @entity56 , the former archbishop of @entity57 , said : ‘ @entity3 is a time to be together with the family , to focus on the children and to have a great time together			2
‘ this day is precious			1
we are now in danger of the gadgets taking over our lives and we are not in control of them			2
’ the @entity67 , @entity68 , a close contender for the post of @entity70 earlier this year , said : ‘ @entity3 is an oasis of peace in an often frenzied world			0
‘ it ’s a pity we do n’t seem able to sustain a 24 - hour period free of our acquisitiveness			0
we do need a sabbath [ rest ] from shopping if only once a year			0
’ and @entity77 , chief executive of @entity78 and a member of the @entity80 , added : ‘ we all miss out if we forget the true meaning of @entity3			0
‘ and we will forget it if there is no space to remember			0
@entity86 businesses have a responsibility to leave that space open for families to spend time with one another			0
@entity56 said : ' @entity3 is a time to be together with the family ... ' ‘ companies like @entity5 will say they are meeting consumer demand			0
but surely even they recognise their responsibility to ensure time for things that money ca n’t buy ? ’ her views echo the words of pope @entity102 , who last year claimed @entity3 had increasingly become a ‘ shopping holiday ’			0
however , a spokesman for @entity5 said that although its website would take orders on christmas day , warehouse staff would not begin dispatching products until @entity13 or december 27			1
he added that last year , some shoppers logged on as early as 6am to download music and books for their new ipods , kindles and other devices			1
@entity116 , of e-retailers ’ organisation @entity115 , said : ‘ as consumers encounter discounts and offers already available in the sales on these sites , it is not surprising they will spend more than £ 300 million even on christmas day itself			1
‘ online , the @entity3 shopping never really stops			2
’ a spokesman for @entity38 said : ‘ we are simply offering something our customers want and have , in past years , demonstrated that they want			0
‘ of course the convenience of online is such that customers can dip in and out of the sales without compromising time with family , friends and the other things that they hold dear at this time of year			1
’ however , mp @entity137 , chairman of the all - party @entity138 in @entity140 , said : ‘ it ’s a sad reflection on our times			0
i hope that most people will be focusing on their families and on bigger issues on @entity3 and not ordering books online			2
‘ i would hope we ’d never see shops opening at @entity3			0
it would require a change in the law and i ca n’t see @entity140 voting for that – most people want to focus on their families and rightly so			0
’ senior @entity156 backbencher sir @entity155 , who speaks for the @entity157 in the @entity158 , added : ‘ i think that it ’s very sad if we ca n’t retain at least one day of the year as a family day , a day of celebration and reflection to mark @entity3 and for people to be together			2
‘ whatever @entity5 or others sell on christmas day , they will just as easily sell on subsequent days			2
it just seems unnecessary commercialism and very regrettable			0
