by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity2 's @entity1 is now just one step from the @entity5 final and says he is being supported every inch of the way by another @entity9 @entity8 who did n’t quite make it to the biggest game in football			1
@entity14 was @entity15 captain in 2002 and he scored the winning goal in the semi-final against @entity18			1
but he also picked up a booking ruling him out of the final			0
@entity1 was a 12 - year - old fan at the time			1
he went on to play for @entity21 – alongside @entity14 in 2011 – and then for @entity2 just like his hero , now he can outdo his idol by playing in the final next sunday at the @entity24			1
eyes on the prize : @entity1 's @entity15 take on @entity27 for a place in the @entity5 final aspirations : should @entity1 play in the final at the @entity24 he 'll have done something his hero and mentor @entity14 did n't ' we have stayed in touch throughout the @entity5 , ' he said			1
' he has sent me a messages before every game of the tournament and when i get back on the team bus there are usually messages too			0
we are in touch and the support helps me			0
' a revenge of sorts will be on the cards on tuesday in @entity47 when @entity15 face @entity27 for only the second time in @entity5 history			1
and with @entity50 likely to step back down to the substitutes ’ bench @entity1 could be in line for start			1
' now i am one step closer to achieving what @entity14 managed to achieve in his career , ' he says			2
' i want to get to the final and win the tournament			2
that was our goal right from the beginning			0
' @entity15 ’s chances are boosted by the absence of @entity27 ’s talisman and top scorer @entity66			1
in light of @entity66 ’s injury @entity1 ’s @entity2 team - mates @entity69 , @entity71 and @entity72 could all now have an even bigger role to play			2
@entity1 said the @entity75 contingent in the @entity2 squad have spoken about nothing but the @entity5 for the past few months , proud of hosting the tournament but also bearing the added pressure of a nation ’s expectations			2
big decision : referee @entity83 shows @entity14 the yellow card that meant he missed the 2002 @entity5 final support : the @entity2 and @entity15 legend has kept in touch with @entity1 before each @entity5 match ' they are well aware that whenever they go out on to the pitch there are millions of people watching them on television , ' @entity1 said			1
' they are handling it very well because it is not easy to play with this pressure			0
the @entity75 at @entity2 started to talk about the @entity5 about two months before			0
' they are proud to have the tournament in their country and we all saw what @entity27 was like last year when they won the @entity105 and how it brought the whole nation together			2
' the expectations are with @entity27 but the belief is increasingly with @entity15 , according to @entity1			1
' we have this feeling that we are close to going all the way , ' he says			0
it ’s now a long time since he came through at @entity113 with @entity14 the player he most looked up to			2
doing what his hero never managed to do would be a great way to head back to @entity2 for the new season for a campaign that will kick - off without another one of his role models , @entity122			0
proud : @entity2 and @entity27 stars @entity69 ( left ) and @entity124 ( right ) , along with team - mates @entity71 and @entity72 , have been talking excitedly about the @entity5 being in their country , says @entity1 on fire : @entity124 celebrates scoring the remarkable free - kick which ultimately saw @entity27 beat @entity129 ' it ’s very sad for all the fans to lose someone who is a @entity2 legend but he had achieved everything at the club , ' he says of the @entity136 midfielder who has played his last @entity2 game			1
' everybody loved him , i certainly loved playing alongside him			0
he was one of my idols when i was young and it was an honour to be his team - mate for one year			0
' there will be reinforcements and the £ 18million purchase from @entity21 last summer has been buoyed by the acquisitions of @entity148 and @entity149 in this summer ’s market			2
' they are both very good players and everybody ’s happy that we have signed them			0
but i am so focused on the @entity5 i do n’t think i will think about the new season until i am on holiday			0
' hopefully for @entity2 ’s @entity8 forward by the time he lies back on his lounger he will have played in a @entity5 final and picked up the winner ’s medal his hero @entity14 was never able to get his hands on			1
hero : @entity1 said he loved playing with @entity122 , who wo n't be at @entity2 when he returns to @entity136			0

@entity14 missed the 2002 final for @entity15 through *suspension*
