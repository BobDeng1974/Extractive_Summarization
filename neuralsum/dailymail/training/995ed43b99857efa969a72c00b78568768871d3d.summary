@entity0 is hoping to discover his best form under @entity2 after almost certainly becoming @entity4 's final addition of the 2014 summer transfer window			1
@entity2 had long stated that the window was closed for the @entity7 , having completed deals for @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 earlier in the summer			2
@entity14 ' departure to @entity15 for the final two years of his five - and - a - half - year @entity4 contract - in effect ending his time at @entity18 following his £ 50million move from @entity20 in january 2011 - necessitated the arrival of another striker , but even then @entity2 moved swiftly to sign @entity0 from @entity23 for £ 10.5million			1
new arrival : @entity0 joined @entity4 from @entity23 for £ 10.5milllion this week @entity26 man : @entity0 says @entity2 has set him goals for this season and can improve his game it could be if an opportunity arises - like the one last year which saw @entity33 join despite passing a medical at @entity35 - @entity4 may make a further signing , but , for now , @entity0 completes the squad for the first half of the 2014 - 15 campaign			1
' i spoke with him ( @entity2 ) , ' @entity0 told chelseafc.com after agreeing a four - year contract			2
' he is very clever and he knows exactly what he wants			0
he has targets for me and i know i have a target for myself as well			0

the striker was part of the @entity56 squad this summer prolific : @entity0 scored 14 league goals last season but did n't to score this year for @entity23 @entity9 has scored four goals in three @entity61 games so far this season after his double in the 6 - 3 win at @entity64			1
@entity0 added : ' we have two great strikers here already and i do n't have a choice if i want to be in the team - i have to play at a very high level			1
' many of those not in contention for a first - team place have left on loan - 21 in all after @entity76 , the midfielder who spent most of last season out with a serious knee injury , joined @entity14 at the @entity79			2
main man : @entity9 has made a great start at @entity4 with four goals in his first three @entity61 games back home : @entity0 will have a tough time getting above club legend @entity12 in the @entity4 pecking order the @entity87 's departure means @entity4 fulfil the @entity61 's homegrown player rule and will have the maximum 17 foreign players in their 25 - man squad			1
of the loan group , only @entity91 , whose initial loan runs until january , did not leave on a season - long deal .			0
