i 'm sick of it , i 'm taking a stand against it			1

@entity7 ’s @entity35 father @entity39 and mother @entity39 , reportedly have been ‘ floored ’ by their daughter ’s decision to turn to porn to fund her $ 60,000 - a - year education at the elite school			1
miss @entity7 said today that her parents were not aware of her decision to enter the porn industry but are now ' absolutely supportive ' of her choice			1
she added : ' we tell our children through school and socialization that sexuality is bad ' before adding to the shock of the panelists that she had been watching online porn alone since the age of 12			2
miss @entity7 has explained that she entered the porn industry to pay for her $ 60,000 - a - year tuition at @entity1			1
the teenager makes around $ 1,000 - $ 1,500 for each film she stars in			2
when asked by @entity63 why she could not work at something else to help pay her way through college , she replied : ' i 'm an 18 - year - old without a college degree			1
any other job would not have footed the bill			0
' she described her career in porn as ' empowering ' because it allowed her to make decisions in a ' safe , controlled environment '			0
exposed : a fellow student outed @entity1 porn star @entity7			1
her real name is @entity7 , 18 , from @entity37 , @entity38 , and was an @entity79 student at the $ 11,000 - a - year @entity81 prep school she attended however she admitted that life at @entity1 has been difficult since her porn career was made public			1
she said : ' i have received numerous death threats , people threatened to throw garbage on me			1
there are petitions online to have me expelled from @entity1			2
it 's been a hostile , unsafe , unwelcoming environment			0
' however miss weeks remained upbeat saying that she plans to graduate from @entity1 with her class and wants to become a lawyer for civil rights , particularly women 's rights			1
she is unsure whether she will continue in her porn career after college			2
a family member told @entity99 exclusively last week that despite the shock , the teenager wo n't be abandoned by her parents			0
@entity103 , the mother - in - law of @entity7 ’s brother @entity104 , told @entity99 : ‘ this is a tragedy in the family			1
the father is one of the best human beings i ’ve ever met			0
he is just back from @entity109 ; he served his country , how awesome is that ? ‘ he ’s so proud of his daughter ; there ’s no way they could have known this was going on			0
but they would never abandon their daughter			0
this is a nightmare what the family are going through			0
’ last week , @entity7 had claimed in interviews that her parents had only themselves to blame for her decision			1
' the financial aid that i was given to pay for my tuition was insufficient and just really an enormous financial burden on my family , ' she said			2
shocked : dr @entity129 returned from a tour of duty in @entity109 to discover his daughter was making x-rated films to fund her college studies			1
he and his wife @entity39 are heartbroken over what @entity7 is doing several relatives , friends and associates of the family interviewed by @entity99 painted a picture of an extremely devoted couple who have only wanted the best for their three children , @entity7 , sister @entity143 , 20 , and brother @entity104 , 22			1
@entity39 , 54 , and @entity144 , 48 , were dumbfounded when they learned that their daughter was a porn actress just 24 hours before the news broke			0
in their suburban home in @entity37 , 250 miles east of @entity149 , the couple was slowly coming to grips with their daughter ’s new lifestyle			1
mr weeks , a religious @entity35 , is an esteemed doctor at the @entity155 in @entity37 , which deals only with war veterans			2
his @entity158 wife comes from a culture where pornography is generally vilified			1
educating their children and setting them on the right path meant everything to them , say family members , and their financial outlay on their children ’s education has been staggering , even on dr weeks ’s six - figure salary			2
grin and bare it : even before emarking on her new career , sexy @entity7 like to show off all the children , including @entity7 , attended @entity174 in @entity37 , a @entity81 school known for its high academic and sporting achievements			1
tuition is about $ 11,000 a year			2
it was well worth the outlay			0
@entity7 was a straight a ‘ genius ’ student			2
she was given the ‘ @entity182 ’ in foreign languages during her final school year , 2012 - 13			2
it ’s hardly surprising that out of 38,000 applicants , @entity7 was one of just over 3,000 students admitted to prestigious @entity1			1
a doctor of @entity7 ’s father ’s standing would earn in excess of $ 200,000 a year plus deployment pay			1
it ’s believed that mrs weeks is not working right now			0
putting three children through private schools and college would cost over $ 1 million			2
as @entity7 herself said in an interview with the website www.realcleareducation : ‘ i have siblings in college , who are being supported by my parents , and my parents are paying $ 1,000 a month just for their own student loans and my dad graduated 20 years ago			1
' one of my parents is recently unemployed			0
i was offered $ 13,000 in financial aid			0
that was n't enough -- that 's $ 47,000 still unaccounted for			0
’ the couple also recently moved to a new house on a private estate in @entity37			2
they bought their four - bedroom home costing $ 477,730 , but they are burdened with a substantial mortgage of $ 460,607			2
in all likelihood , friends conclude , the family are going through financial hardship and cut @entity7 ’s funding because they could n’t afford the tuition fees and the living expenses , which total in excess of $ 6,000 a month			1
but many who know the @entity228 say that talk of them simply abandoning their child is ridiculous , which rings true considering how much @entity7 backed off her initial claims of financial abandonment			1
as one family member says : ‘ the more interviews she did , the more the truth came out that the family did n’t cut her funding			0
she just said that paying such a large amount would be a strain on any family , but it ’s hard to see they ’d abandoned her			0
‘ it seems more reasonable to suspect that she did n’t tell the family the truth as to how little aid she was getting from @entity1			2
ironically , she may have been trying to protect them from further financial pain , ’ said one source			0
@entity250 ’s , @entity7 ’s agent who spoke to @entity99 , insists her family is at fault for all of this			2
he says : ‘ she ’s not done anything wrong			0
her parents have cut her off financially			0
in the first semester , her parents worked out a payment plan with the university for tuition of $ 5,000 a month			1
but that lasted until the month of january , and then they cut her off			0
‘ so starting february 1 , she owed the school $ 5,000 a month			0
where is an 18 - year - old girl supposed to get that ? ’ @entity250 , who runs @entity264 in @entity265 , said he had ‘ @entity7 ’ booked up for four days solid of shoots in @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 during the media frenzy			1
no regrets : her agent insisted to @entity99 that she is ' level - headed , intelligent ' and ' never regretted doing porn '			0
for now , at least smackdown : @entity7 smooches with a fellow porn star , a prelude of more to come in one of her racy flicks ‘ if she had n’t done porn , she ’d have been thrown out of school , as she would have missed the monthly payments			1
i have no idea why they cut her off , as far as i know her parents were running into financial problems			0
‘ she makes a lot of money from porn			0
she could easily make $ 10 - 15,000 a month , that ’s for multiple shoots			2
she gets $ 1,500 - 2,000 per shoot , then i get a cut , which is less than 20 percent and then it ’s taxed			0
it ’s a legitimate business i run			0
‘ she simply had to make a decision whether she wanted to continue with her college career or drop out of school			0
she wants a college education , so had no other option			0
she tried to apply for government grants , scholarships , but the irony is that her parents make enough money so that she ’s not eligible for anything			0
' she ’s not poor enough , but they ’re not paying for her , so they ’re doubly screwing her because she ’s not viable for financial aid and they ’re not helping her			0
‘ my question is that if she wants to become a lawyer and stay at @entity1 , what else could she possibly do ? ’ @entity250 says @entity7 comes to @entity269 during her breaks , or if she has a weekend off			1
she ’s planning to go out to @entity269 for the whole summer , and hopefully pay for the rest of her next semester .			0
