@entity0 looks certain to be ruled out of the @entity1 on sunday after it emerged the @entity3 8 underwent surgery on his damaged left ankle on saturday morning			1
the @entity7 star , who finished the autumn as @entity3 ’s first - choice no 8 and was named @entity10 man of the series following a string of barnstorming displays , was injured during friday night ’s @entity15 clash against @entity16 and left the field on a stretcher requiring oxygen just after half - time			1
it is understood the 25 - year - old was taken to hospital in @entity7 and underwent surgery in the early hours of saturday morning to repair badly damaged ligaments			1
@entity7 's @entity0 leaves the pitch on a stretcher after he suffered a leg injury in the second - half @entity0 is likely to miss the @entity1 for @entity3 after having ankle surgery on saturday morning he now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines and , although his @entity34 participation is not believed to be under threat , his chances of playing in the @entity1 are ‘ almost zero ’			1
‘ @entity0 went under the knife soon after the game , ’ said a source close to the player			1
‘ we ’re waiting to hear the full extent of the damage but the fact he was sent for surgery so soon after the injury occurred is clearly not a good sign			2
’ @entity7 director of rugby @entity49 initially played down fears @entity0 had broken his ankle but extensive ankle ligament damage has left @entity3 coach @entity53 needing to look elsewhere for a starting no 8 to face @entity54 in @entity55 on february 6			1
@entity7 fly half @entity57 fires over a last - minute penalty to secure victory for the home side @entity0 ( left ) celebrates with @entity7 scrum half @entity61 after his superb try in the first - half @entity65 ( @entity16 ) : dropped during the autumn series but is back in form			1
@entity68 ( @entity69 ) : turns 37 this year but continues to deliver			0
@entity70 ( @entity71 ) : has scored nine tries in 12 appearances this season			0
@entity75 ( @entity76 ) : powerful ball - carrying ability and experience			0
@entity80 ( @entity81 ) : normally on the blindside but a switch to no 8 could provide some spark			0
@entity86 ( @entity71 ) : a possible bolter for selection who has previously been praised by @entity53			2
@entity91 ( @entity92 ) : the @entity94 state the @entity95 – based @entity96 will only be picked under ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			0
‘ when you see someone coming off on a stretcher it ’s never a good sign , ’ @entity49 said			0
a formal release is expected at some point sunday			0
with @entity104 already sweating on the fitness of first - choice centre @entity106 ( groin ) and tighthead prop @entity109 ( foot ) , he will have to embark on the final @entity1 campaign before the @entity34 without a host of star performers			1
@entity3 ’s autumn was blighted by injury withdrawals and it looks as if history is repeating itself			2
@entity0 ’s anticipated withdrawal is hugely significant			2
with 27 caps now under his belt , the 19 - stone powerhouse emerged as one of @entity3 ’s most effective forwards during the autumn , scoring three tries while offering scrum ballast and a constant ball - carrying threat			1
@entity129 8 @entity65 - his most likely replacement - has endured a difficult season , suffering back - to - back concussions either side of the autumn series and struggling to recapture the outstanding form of the past two seasons			1
@entity137 8 @entity65 ( left ) looks set to profit from @entity0 's injury by reclaiming his @entity3 spot @entity65 is finding some form again after losing confidence and suffering back to back concussions the 22 - year - old remains favourite to replace @entity0 at the @entity144 but he will need to show an improvement in form during @entity16 ’ upcoming @entity148 clashes with @entity149 and @entity150 over the next fortnight			1
he was subdued again on friday night , despite insisting he has put his troubled autumn behind him			0
‘ i am going to make sure i am never again in the position i was in the autumn where i questioned my own ability , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a tough time for me			0
self - doubt started creeping in			0
i ’d never had that before			0
’ the rest of @entity3 ’s @entity160 cupboard is not overly well stocked			2
at 36 , @entity69 ’ @entity68 is still a hugely influential @entity15 performer while @entity92 ’s @entity91 remains one of @entity164 rugby ’s outstanding back - rowers			0
@entity69 ' @entity68 is another contender for the no 8 role but has never been picked by @entity53 @entity92 ’s @entity91 ( right ) will only be picked for @entity3 in extreme circumstances but both men appear to be off @entity3 ’s radar , with @entity91 unavailable due to @entity94 policy dictating that only home - based players can be picked while @entity53 has not named @entity172 in a single squad since taking over from @entity174 in 2012			1
@entity71 ’s @entity70 could provide similar attributes to @entity0 while his heavyweight @entity71 team - mate @entity86 has attracted plenty of attention this season			2
@entity76 captain @entity75 has also enjoyed his best season for a number of years , although he has been starting on the openside flank alongside the hugely impressive @entity185 - born no 8 @entity184			2
the make - up of @entity104 ’s back row has been hotly debated , with many believing captain @entity188 is better suited to the blindside flank , where @entity80 has struggled in recent months			0
but with @entity0 apparently one of the few names guaranteed a @entity1 start , his expected absence leaves @entity104 with even more head - scratching to do			1
@entity76 captain @entity75 is enjoying an impressive season but has been playing on the openside flank @entity71 ’s @entity70 could offer similar attributes to @entity0 - his team - mate @entity86 is another player who has attracted plenty of attention this season			1
