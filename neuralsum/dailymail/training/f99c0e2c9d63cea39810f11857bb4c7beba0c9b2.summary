by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 17 january 2013 we 've had jeans that squeeze your tummy in , others that make your legs look longer - and now @entity7 is to launch denim that tackles cellulite			1
the @entity13 jeans brand 's ' @entity11 ' skinny jeans from the new @entity15 range are made from fabric treated with orange peel - busting ingredients such as caffeine , retinol and algae extract			1
but in a bizarre twist , @entity7 have hired the super-skinny @entity23 to model the range			2
sheer jeanius ? model @entity23 strikes a pose in a pair of @entity7 's new @entity15 jeans so does that mean the brand are worried the cellulite - busting jeans just do n't work ? although thin @entity23 probably does n't have much cellulite to worry about , @entity7 say that clinical tests showed that 69 per cent of those trialling the jeans reported an improvement in the appearance of their thighs			1
testers at the @entity42 in @entity43 wore the jeans for eight hours a day , five days a week during the six - week testing period			0
other options in the @entity15 range , due to go on sale at @entity49 at the end of the month , include pairs infused with moisturising olive oil extract and soothing aloe vera			1
bringing sexy back : the jeans , which could give you a perter posterior , are being sold via online retailer , @entity49 but do n't throw your body moisturiser away just yet : the interior coating only lasts for 15 wears or between four and six washes			0
annoying though that might be , @entity7 has also created a ' reload spray ' to use after each wash , which should extend the beauty benefits for up to 95 wears			0
after that , you 'll be left with plain old denim , although they should still look good with your favourite jumper			0
the jeans , which start at Â£ 85 per pair , come in the skinny ' @entity72 ' , ' @entity67 ' and ' @entity69 ' styles , and will go on sale on the 28th january .			2
