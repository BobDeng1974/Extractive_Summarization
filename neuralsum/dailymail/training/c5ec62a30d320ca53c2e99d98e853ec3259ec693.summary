at first sight it would appear to be a contradiction of the most bizarre kind			0
on the one hand , we have women all over the western world lining up to enjoy the story of a powerful man and his sex slave , whom he treats with savage abandon			1
references to rough sex are everywhere : the world is aflame with what are usually considered the seediest of practices			1
on the other hand , at precisely the same moment that @entity19 is storming the box office , there ’s another story in the news — about a powerful man said to have used not one but several disempowered women as his paid sex slaves			1
in this case , the world is outraged			1
why , in one case , should violent sex have become such a collective female fantasy , drawing millions to the cinema and making a cool £ 161.6 million in its opening weekend , while in the other , it should be a cause of international condemnation ? even though @entity43 ’s trial may end soon — his lawyers have asked for an acquittal after four prostitutes dropped their civil actions against him — the details to emerge from the hearing have nevertheless been stomach - churning			1
from 2007 , @entity43 was one of the world ’s most influential decision - makers			1
his career ended abruptly in may 2011 when he was taken into custody , following accusations of sexual assault by a @entity70 hotel maid			0
these claims were eventually dropped			0
however , what we learned last week is that this key global figure viewed women as nothing more than objects , and despised objects at that			1
lawyers for the 65 - year - old concede that he took part in sex parties between 2008 and 2011 , but argue that he did so without knowing that the women were professionals ( in @entity86 , it is against the law to solicit or run a prostitution operation )			1
they also deny that he organised the parties			0
@entity43 and his partner @entity90 pictured in 2013			1
@entity43 is alleged to have co-ordinated a sex ring regardless , the manner in which he treated these women was brutish			1
he is accused not only of being a pimp , but a violent pimp who routinely and barbarically abused the women in his employ			1
in one chilling account , a witness told the court that she was ‘ forced into ’ certain sex acts against her will , while @entity43 gazed on ‘ smiling ’			1
he is accused of having engaged in anal rape			0
meanwhile , his orgies were described in terms of the most extreme violence as both ‘ a massacre ’ and ‘ slaughterhouse ’ with a ‘ mishmash ’ of writhing bodies			0
despite holding the fate of the world in his hands during the financial crisis , he evidently viewed half its population in terms only of their sexual function			1
‘ i dare you to distinguish between a prostitute and a naked socialite , ’ he taunted the court			1
swaggering and self - assured , he was robustly unrepentant			0
‘ i was one of the world ’s most powerful men , ’ he bragged			1
‘ many people wanted to please me			0
women have offered themselves to me ten times			1
it is nothing unusual to me			0
’ he styled himself not as a rapacious monster , but a ‘ libertine who likes to party ’ , noting merely : ‘ i have a rougher sexuality than the average man			1
’ few would not recoil from his words			0
but as one man asked me this week : ‘ if this is what sadism looks like in the sagging flesh , then what the hell are so many women doing fantasising about being tied up and beaten ? ’ ‘ and why , ’ he demanded , ‘ is this happening at a time when they have never been more empowered ? ’ former @entity44 boss , @entity43 , was once one of the world ’s most influential decision - makers but his career ended in may 2011 when he was taken into custody , following accusations of sexual assault it is easy to understand the disbelief			1
there may still be a massive amount of work to be done in preventing women being subjected to discrimination and harassment			1
nevertheless , most of us consider ourselves if not as strong as men , then considerably stronger			0
historically , we can be more sure of ourselves than ever before			0
girls beat boys hands down at school			0
a review of 308 studies involving 1.1 million children and published by the @entity170 in 2013 found that boys have performed worse than girls at every single subject over the past 100 years across the globe			2
meanwhile , male students are outnumbered by females at most @entity178 universities , despite the fact there are actually more young men than women in the @entity178			2
in adult life , women become herculean multi-taskers , juggling workplace and family demands in a way than makes the majority of men look like amateurs			2
we are exhorted to aim for nothing less than a seat at the boardroom table by campaigners such as @entity198 boss @entity197			0
the @entity44 itself is now headed by the formidable @entity200			1
for today ’s superwomen , submitting to @entity19 - type behaviour might seem utterly incongruous — but the appeal is clearly strong			1
a friend ’s nine - year - old daughter mused over spaghetti hoops : ‘ @entity208 ’s mother is having a handcuff party to celebrate this new film			2
’ cue parental jaws dropping about the kitchen table			0
apparently , the hostess in question ( sassy , assertive in her job ) views this as being innocuous : a celebration of herself , her friends , and a manifestation of what used to be referred to as ‘ girl power ’			0
and that ’s the strange logic at the heart of this sexual conundrum : now that women find themselves increasingly empowered , many seem to be finding more enjoyment from being playfully disempowered in the bedroom			2
and though this is a long way from the brutality of @entity19 and the allegations facing @entity43 , if there is one area of life in which women can take a break from being in control in a loving relationship , while men try their hand at reclaiming it , it may just be here			1
as one senior female executive of my acquaintance tells me : ‘ obviously , it goes without saying that none of us wants real violence in our lives			2
‘ however , i am in charge in every aspect of my existence : my work , my family , my relationship			0
just occasionally , i want to surrender this control and enjoy not being the decision maker			0
‘ i feel like an idiot admitting it , but exploring these fantasies makes me feel feminine			0
this is one area in which i do n’t always have to be calling the shots			0
’ the same — in reverse — may apply for what we now refer to as ‘ new men ’			0
fifty @entity269 's main character , @entity19 , is a sadist who treats women as objects , but he is also deemed a ‘ safe ’ sadist women can control a lawyer friend , who boasts a predilection for bondage , insists : ‘ my husband needs this vent , too			1
in his public life , he is the ultimate new man : kind , caring , a good father and colleague			2
he ’s so good , it becomes exhausting			0
the bedroom is a safe space in which he can try on traditionally masculine roles without compromising his personality			0
’ even women who maintain more traditional roles insist they , too , require escapism			2
a full - time mother - of - three told me : ‘ i may not be ball - breaking in the boardroom , but i still need some sort of release , not least on days when i feel more of a feeding machine than a female			2
‘ i think of this sort of sex as a healthier take on “ wine o’clock ” — that moment when everything else can be shut out			2
i can stop running a one - woman show and switch off			0
’ in other words , it is not so much rough sex as an opportunity for imaginative escapism that these women truly want			1
besides , @entity19 is a sadist recreated in @entity308 form			1
he may treat women as objects , but the right woman will be an object hotly and tenderly adored			2
he will dominate only her , a faithful tormentor			0
a ‘ safe ’ sadist women can control			2
the answer , then , to the paradox as to why so many modern women appear to be seeking to cede power in the bedroom is that they are still in control ; crucially , they have given their consent			2
where the problems , as evidenced all too horrifically in the @entity43 trial , emerge is when consent is not granted			1
it is then that the grisly reality of what can happen when such fantasies veer out of control is brutally exposed .			0

women all over the world have been *queuing* up to see @entity19
the film tells the story of a powerful man and his sex slave
at the same time , last week a court heard a case involving a sex ring
former @entity44 chief @entity43 allegedly co-ordinated this
why does one attract women worldwide and the other draws condemnation ?
