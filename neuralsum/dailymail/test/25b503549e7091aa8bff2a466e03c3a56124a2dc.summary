humans may have been lighting fires since we lived in caves and dined on woolly mammoth , but now there ’s 21st century way to create a flame			0
a new lighter uses electricity to ignite , and it ’s claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind			0
the device , called the @entity13 , creates a ‘ super high - intensity ’ electrical arc and contains a rechargeable lithium - ion battery so users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again			1
a bright idea : a new lighter ( pictured ) uses electricity to ignite candles and paper for example , and it ’s claimed to be the first flameless gadget of its kind its inventors , based in @entity28 , @entity29 , are raising money to put the lighter into production on @entity32 and have almost doubled their goal			2
instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the @entity13 creates a ‘ super high - intensity ’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes			1
flameless : instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the @entity13 creates a ‘ super high - intensity ’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes			1
its inventors say it lights in any direction and is rechargeable , among other qualities shown above safer ? instead of using a spark and fuel mechanism like traditional lighters , the @entity13 creates a ‘ super high - intensity ’ electrical arc between two ceramic electrodes			1
this means there is no flare ups ( pictured ) like with matches or conventional lighters that can easily burn fingers @entity13 replaces a traditional flame with a high intensity electric arc that focuses its energy at the tip. it does n’t need to be refilled with fuel but is instead powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery			1
' simply place the @entity13 on its dedicated usb powered charging dock and it will be ready for the next moment you need it , ’ the company says			2
‘ when electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter , it produces what is known as an electric arc			2
‘ the air between these electrodes becomes ionised , creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat			0
' ‘ when electricity jumps between the two conducting electrodes at the tip of the lighter , it produces what is known as an electric arc , ' the company explains			0
‘ the air between these electrodes becomes ionised , creating the brilliant visual arc which produces the high heat			0
’ while the arc may be smaller than an open flame , it is much hotter , so it lights wicks more quickly and can be used from any angle			2
the company says : ‘ unlike a regular lighter , there is no flame that can flare - up when positioned upside down			2
‘ you can freely use the @entity13 in any direction			0
' the lighter has flame - proof ceramic tips with a zinc alloy cover and a plastic body			0
it focuses its heat at the tip so it wo n’t leave sooty marks behind			0
convenient : the device ( pictured ) has a built - in lithium ion battery and comes with a usb - powered dock ( also shown ) so it can be easily recharged			1

the start - up shows the lighter being used to ignite candles , incense , gas stove tops and paper as long as the material fits between the electrodes			0
the device costs cad $ 40 ( £ 21 or us $ 32 ) via @entity32 including the charger and cable			1
it 's expected to ship in november			0
durable : the device ( pictured ) , called the @entity13 , contains a lithium - ion battery and can be recharged , meaning that users will never run out of fuel at a tricky moment again			1

@entity13 creates a ‘ super high - intensity ’ electrical arc
it uses electricity stored in a lithium ion battery instead of *standard* fuel
@entity135 is smaller than an open flame , but is much hotter and does *n't* flare up
device is available to *pre-order* via @entity32 for cad $ 40 ( £ 21 or us $ 32 )
