@entity0 has showcased a new system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions – and it is set to be rolled out by the end of this year			1
the @entity9 company ’s ‘ sensing ’ technology offers a collection of driving aids to make journeys safer and easier for drivers			1
they work using a ‘ millimetre - wave radar ’ which is fitted to a car ’s radiator grille and a monocular camera mounted near the car ’s rear - view mirror			1
@entity0 has revealed a driver - assistive system that can read road signs and spot pedestrians to lessen the chance of collisions – and it 's set to be rolled out by the end of this year			1
it uses a ‘ millimetre - wave radar ’ which is fitted to a car ’s radiator grille and a monocular camera mounted near the car ’s rear - view mirror ( illustrated ) more than 1.2 million people are killed in car crashes around the world every year , but auto manufacturers are developing increasingly smart cars with a host of new safety features that give vehicles a mind of their own			1
@entity0 's radar can spot obstacles in the road , such as pedestrians , oncoming vehicles , or cars directly in front , while the camera captures information such as the object ’s size , speed and distance from the front of the car			1
when there is a risk of collision with a vehicleor a pedestrian , the system can provide the driver with audio and visual warnings			0
the radar spots obstacles in the road , such as pedestrians , oncoming vehicles , or cars directly in front , while the camera captures information such as the object ’s size , speed and distance from the front of the car			1
the system can warn the driver of an obstacle and brake if needed , as shown in this diagram if a pedestrian or obstacle is too close , the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) automatically applies gentle brake pressure to warn the driver			2
if they do n’t respond , the system automatically brakes to avoid an obstacle and a driver can steer the while to activate a ' collision avoidance effort ' ( pictured ) if the distance gets closer , the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) will automatically apply gentle brake pressure to warn the driver			1
if they do n’t respond , the system will automatically brake hard to avoid an obstacle			0
developing a system that can detect pedestrians has been a challenge for many car manufacturers because they do not reflect radio waves well and can move unpredictably or quickly			0
but the camera used in the new system can spot them within 196ft ( 60 metres ) ahead of the vehicle			0
the system itself recognises the car ’s surroundings and the intentions of the driver , the company says			0
for example , the @entity109 ( @entity110 ) system keeps a car in its lane			0
the camera detects the lane boundaries and if the car looks like it will stray from a detected line , the steering wheel will vibrate to warn the driver			2
the bundle of sensing technology also uses the camera to read traffic signs ( illustrated ) to show them on the dashboard display , or a heads - up display projected onto the windscreen , making it easier for drivers to notice a change in the speed limit it will also correct steering , if necessary , to pull the car back into lane			1
if it predicts that a vehicle could leave the road – if a driver has fallen asleep at the wheel , for example – it will brake			0
the bundle of sensing technology also uses the camera to read traffic signs to show them on the dashboard display , or a heads - up display projected onto the windscreen , making it easier for drivers to notice a change in the speed limit			2
@entity0 ’s sensing technology will be embedded in its legend – a luxury car that will become available in @entity9 towards the end of this year			1
the model is known as the @entity154 in the @entity155			0
the technology will be rolled out to other cars in @entity9 , before being embedded in @entity155 vehicles			1
it is expected to bridge the gap between today ’s minimal driver assist technology and autonomous vehicles of the future			0
the @entity164 assist system is shown , which warns drivers about their position and helps them stay in lane if they are about to leave the road collision mitigation braking system : the radar and camera can detect oncoming vehicles and pedestrians			1
if there is a risk of a collision , the system warns the driver and if they do n’t respond , it brakes hard			0
road departure mitigation system : the camera detects lane boundaries and if a car drives outside them , a warning is shown on the display and the steering wheel vibrates			1
it will correct steering is necessary and brake to stop a car coming off the road			2
@entity195 : the system detects pedestrians and a boundary line on the side of the road			0
it can predict a crash if the car strays from the road and will steer the car away from the person if necessary			0
@entity207 : the system will assist the driver ’s steering during highway driving to keep the vehicle in the middle of the lane using a vibrating steering wheel			2
@entity216 : the system can detect the distance and speed gap from a vehicle ahead , controlling the acceleration and braking so an appropriate distance is maintained			2
@entity223 : the camera detects traffic signs and they are shown on the display or a heads - up display on the windscreen			0
false start prevention function : the radar can spot a vehicle in front of a car that ’s stopped or is driving at a low speed			1
the system stops sudden accidental acceleration to prevent crashes			0
lead @entity238 : the radar can detect when a car in front stops in traffic , giving the driver a visual and audio warning to prepare to brake .			2

@entity0 's system is set to be rolled out by the end of this year in @entity9
‘ sensing ’ tech offers a collection of driving aids to make journeys safer
it uses a radar and camera mounted on a car to see obstacles ahead
radar spots obstacles in the road , such as pedestrians , oncoming vehicles , or cars directly in front , while the camera *gauges* their speed and distance
system provides warnings to drivers and takes control by steering if needed
it can brake for pedestrians or steer to keep a car in lane on the *motorway*
