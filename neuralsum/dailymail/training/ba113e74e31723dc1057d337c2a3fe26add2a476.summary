the invite is classic @entity1 - white , minimalist , and devoid of much writing			0
but it heralds what is perhaps the most anticipated device in the world ( at least since @entity1 's last launc ) - the fifth version of the @entity9			1
@entity1 is still staying quiet on exactly what will be announced - but , if you look at the invitation , a certain shadow manages , without saying a word , to confirm the @entity15 is real , and just weeks away			0
the invite : @entity1 's minimalist invitation asks people to attend the @entity19 launch event on the 12th - and the shadow of a five forms underneath the invitation offers a clue that the fifth version of the popular @entity9 could be in the pipeline			1
the invitation says ' it 's almost here '			2
a large number 12 on the invite , corresponding to the date of the event , casts a shadow of a number 5			0
the event will take place at @entity19 's @entity36 , the site where @entity1 has unveiled various past products such as the @entity39			1
the new handset has been the subject of astonishing online rumours , with a plethora of supposed leaks showing everything from batteries to motherboards			0
and in recent days , the leaks have become more common , with the most recent showing a supposedly working @entity9 being switched on			2
however , despite all the speculation , @entity1 has refused to confirm any details of the new handset - indeed , it has even refused to admit it is launching one			0
however , the majority of the leaks point to two major updates to the iconic handset - a 4 inch screen using a new type on thin display , and a new connector .			1

launch will take place in @entity19 's @entity36
*ceo* @entity62 expected to unveil new version of the @entity9 with a larger 4 inch screen and a *controversial* new dock connector
