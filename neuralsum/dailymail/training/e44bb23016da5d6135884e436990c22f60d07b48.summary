by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:51 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 24 september 2013 @entity2 hope to eliminate the roughly 20,000 pages of regulations that the federal government has published under the @entity7 law			1
house speaker @entity8 reportedly favors a ' repeal and replace ' approach a group that represents more than 190 conservative republicans in the @entity12 will unveil a plan on wednesday to replace the @entity7 with a radically different approach to eliminating @entity1 's health care gap			1
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , an informal caucus that provides research and writes legislation for conservative partisans , plans to offer a 200 - page bill that would repeal president @entity22 's 900 - page health care overhaul and its 20,000 pages of related federal regulations			1
but right - wingers will undoubtedly hit a roadblock with democrats when they learn that the bill would ban the use of federal tax dollars for funding abortions			0
sponsored by @entity33 @entity32 rep. @entity32 , @entity34 would repeal the @entity7 law and offer taxpayers direct subsidies so they can choose their own insurance plans on the open market			1
the tax deductions , valued at $ 7,500 for individuals and $ 20,000 for families , would be portable from job to job			1
americans would be permitted to pocket whatever portion of the subsidies they do n't spend , and insurance plan purchases would be permitted across state lines on a nationwide basis for the first time			0
more attractively for conservative @entity2 , the proposal would cut federal bureaucrats out of the health care - buying process , giving @entity1 full authority to decide what kind of insurance suits them			1
' this is about giving @entity1 all the choices and none of the grief , ' a @entity2 @entity12 staffer to an @entity16 member told @entity64			1
' basically , we 've had it up to here with voters telling us to kill @entity7 before it kills them			0
' a billboard in @entity69 promotes a plan to defund @entity7			2
the conservative @entity71 sponsored the ad @entity33 rep. @entity32 ( @entity74 ) and @entity76 rep. @entity75 ( r ) lead the @entity16 and promoted their bill wednesday on @entity79 ' we think people are smart enough and will find the best plan for their family , ' @entity32 told @entity84 , which first reported the details of the @entity16 's plan			0
@entity32 stressed @entity2 ' belief that @entity1 should have a wider berth when choosing their health insurance , and said the @entity16 's bill would provide options ' if sex change operations are not something you want ... if you want a bare - bones policy , [ or ] if you want a @entity97 plan			1
' ' by allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines and pool together so small businesses and families can get the same buying power as large corporations , ' he said wednesday in a press release , ' we can lower costs and increase choices while removing @entity109 bureaucrats from your health care decisions			1
' according to a bill summary provided to @entity64 , the proposal would provide for a 10 - year $ 25 ' high risk pool ' fund , intended to offset the health care costs of @entity1 suffering from pre-existing conditions that could otherwise make them ineligible for some private insurance plans			1
the law would also prohibit the spending of federal health care dollars to provide abortion services			1
the @entity22 administration has made hay in recent months over @entity2 ' reluctance to offer an alternative to the @entity7 law while simultaneously complaining that it represents a government takeover of one - seventh of @entity1 's private - sector economy			1
while @entity12 @entity2 leaders have held more than 40 separate votes to repeal the law , they nave failed to rally around a single replacement proposal			2
president @entity22 has taken public victory laps this year on his health care law , but his hand - picked press conference companions do n't reflect the country 's mood , polls show the cheerleader : @entity142 secretary @entity141 addressed health care providers on monday in @entity144 , as part of a tour to quell concerns before the @entity7 law 's october 1 enrollment deadline ' they offer no hope of a better situation when it comes to healthcare for all those millions of @entity1 , ' @entity151 press secretary @entity150 said on monday			1
' they say , " sorry , we ’re going to take away those refunds , we ’re going to take away the benefits that you ’ve already enjoyed , " all in the name of an ideological agenda			0
the president engaged @entity2 directly on monday , saying that he is ' more than willing to work with them where they 've got specific suggestions that they can show will make our health care system work better			1
' but he , too , insisted that the @entity2 had not proferred a workable alternative			0
' remember , ' he said , ' initially this was like " repeal and replace , " and the replace thing has kind of gone off to the wayside			0
now it 's just " repeal			0
" ' the @entity151 has not commented wednesday on the @entity16 's reported proposal			0
but the liberal @entity178 website called it an impractical ' health care unicorn			2
' @entity182 - affiliated conservatives rallied in @entity109 on sept. 10 , demanding the kind of @entity7 exemptions for all taxpayers that members of @entity187 and their staffers have already won from the @entity151 president @entity22 has also complained this week about reports that the @entity2 plans to use the @entity7 law as a bargaining chip in an upcoming federal budget fight			1
president @entity22 is sticking to his guns as the october 1 @entity7 deadline approaches for individual taxpayers during a wednesday speech to the @entity198 , he blamed @entity2 partisanship for holding the federal budget , and a planned increase in the federal debt ceiling , hostage to a health care law repeal			1
' this town , @entity109 , is locked up , ' @entity22 said , blaming a ' small faction ' of @entity2 intent on derailing ' progress ' on various issues			2
congressional republicans , he claimed , are ' extort [ ing ] ' the @entity151 with threats of a debt default			0
' what we now have , ' said @entity22 , ' is a ideological fight that 's been mounted in the @entity12 that says , we 're not going to pass a budget and we will threaten a government shutdown unless we repeal the @entity7			1
' ' we have not seen this in the past , that a budget is contingent on us eliminating a program that was voted on , passed by both chambers of @entity187 , ruled constitutional by the @entity222 , is two weeks from being fully implemented , and that helps 30 million people finally get health care coverage			2
' sen. @entity226 , an outspoken @entity69 @entity227 , predicted an electoral disaster last week for republicans who go to the mat for an @entity7 repeal			0
' what ’s going on here – and i ’ve never seen anything quite like this – is , this small few who represent maybe five percent of the electorate dictate what ’s going on , hold the country by the neck and paralyze things , ' @entity226 said			0
' the good news is , we do have elections			0
and if they succeed in their platform , they will fail the way @entity249 failed			0
' seventy - four @entity2 representatives – far more than five percent but not enough to form a @entity12 majority – have signed on to a plan that ties a budget ' continuing resolution ' to the repeal or defunding of the @entity7 , @entity22 's signature legislative achievement , even at the risk of shutting down the government in a stalemate			1
@entity2 moderates have resisted , citing fears that @entity1 would hold the @entity2 responsible for any government shutdown			2
a consensus is slowly building among @entity12 moderates , however , for a plan that would call for a one - year moratorium on @entity7 enforcement			0
anti-obamacare protesters may have the pulse of @entity1 after all , judging from the latest polling data to emerge about the @entity7 ' i think you ’re seeing more of us in the @entity12 gravitating toward a one - year delay , ' @entity32 told @entity84 , ' as the most – right now , the most – likely way to get relief from @entity7 and to keep this fight going			2
' according to the @entity16 , its @entity34 would : the first hard deadlines attached to the law are just two weeks away , but the @entity151 has already announced a one - year delay before insurance coverage mandates will be enforced against employers			0
rep. @entity75 , a @entity76 @entity32 who is a medical doctor , told a gaggle of reporters wednesday morning that delaying implementation for individual taxpayers as well would ' allow people to find out what a pig in the poke they bought			0
' @entity75 said another year of breathing room would give taxpayers ' some clarity for the rule - making			2
it 'll also give us the chance to go out and define clearly what they have now with the current law , and what they could have			0
' he held a copy of the @entity16 's plan in his right hand as he spoke			0
' unfortunately , during the @entity7 debate no one asked me or any of the other @entity2 doctors what we thought , despite requesting several meetings with the president because i saw this train wreck coming , ' he said wednesday in a statement			2
' we know the president ’s health care law is unworkable and that is exactly why chairman @entity32 asked me to help draft a replacement bill			1
our bill will not increase taxes , does not rely on mandates , expands coverage and lowers costs			0
' the @entity7 is reaching new lows in popularity among ordinary taxpayers			0
a @entity333 / @entity332 poll released this week found that 53 per cent of @entity1 disapprove of the health care law , a number that matches the highest the poll has measured since the law passed in @entity187			1
and an @entity340 / @entity339 poll found that just 12 per cent of @entity1 believe the implementation of @entity7 will be positive for their families .			2

plan would completely replace @entity7 with tax deductions of up to $ 20,000
@entity2 ' aim is to cut bureaucrats out of the process and give taxpayers ' all the choices and none of the grief '
@entity22 administration has *criticized* the @entity2 for seeking a repeal without proposing its own solution to @entity1 's health insurance gap
polls show the president 's signature health care overhaul law is wildly *unpopular* as its first hard deadline approaches on oct. 1
