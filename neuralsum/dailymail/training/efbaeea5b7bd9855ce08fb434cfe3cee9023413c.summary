by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 12 october 2012 it is traditionally the risk of being attacked by dogs that prevents nervous postmen from delivering the mail			2
but homes in one suburban cul - de - sac have been declared out of bounds for a rather less obvious threat – fleas			2
@entity11 has suspended deliveries to the addresses amid claims one member of staff was ‘ eaten alive ’ by the insects			1
' unprecedented ' : @entity19 resident @entity18 with the letter from @entity11 to say deliveries had been suspended outbreak : neighbours in the @entity7 have blamed the flea infestation on a rented property with they claim has a history of hygiene issues the postman 's arms and legs were covered in bites after he delivered letters to the @entity7 in @entity33 , and residents - one of whom described seeing him brushing the bugs from his trousers - have blamed the outbreak on a rented home they say has a history of hygiene issues			1
as well as putting up with the fleas jumping into their own properties , fed - up neighbours have now been forced to drive to the nearest delivery office to pick up their post after @entity11 temporarily blocked deliveries to @entity19 , @entity47			1
@entity18 , 58 , who lives next door to the flea - ridden house , said the bugs had got into her home and garden and bitten her face while she slept			2
she said : ' it ’s a joke , it ’s making me ill , i ca n’t live here anymore			2
' disgusting ' : @entity18 says she has been forced to sleep in her kitchen after being bitten on the face by fleas as she slept ' it ’s been going on for seven weeks			2
the other night i was in bed and the fleas were jumping on my face			2
' i have slept in a chair in my kitchen because i ca n’t go back to my bed , and i ’ve also been at a friend ’s house			0
' i have spent nearly £ 700 on carpets and for the pest control office from @entity71 to come out and various insecticides			0

' she claimed the house in question - occupied by a woman who lives alone - had a fly infestation last year because of dog mess			0
' she did have a dog but she never looked after it , ' she said			0
' last year there was a fly infestation because there was dogs mess everywhere			0
' people point blank refused to go into her home because it was so disgusting			0
' the dog has since been put down and i think that ’s where the fleas have come from , they have nothing to latch on to now			0
' they did try and clean her home but whatever they did did n’t work			0
it ’s still just as bad			0
' @entity103 , 71 , who also lives in the @entity7 , said she had seen the postman brushing off the bugs as he delivered the mail			1

' ' unfair ' : @entity122 said she saw the @entity11 postman brushing fleas from his trousers after making his delivery ' exceptional step ' : @entity11 has suspended deliveries to @entity19 in @entity47 , @entity33 the properties affected are a mixture of bungalows owned by @entity131 , and private houses			1
the occupant of the affected house is thought to be a renting tenant			0
in a letter to residents , @entity136 , @entity11 delivery office manager , said the postman returned from his round having sustained numerous bites from fleas or ticks that were in the grass and gardens of one of the homes			1
he said the decision to suspend deliveries had been taken on health and safety grounds , and explained that , until the situation is resolved , residents would have to travel to the @entity11 ’s nearest delivery office two miles away to collect their post			1
the letter , dated october 4 , said : ' this is now causing us concern and in turn causing the suspension of service			0
' this exceptional step has to be taken in order to safeguard the health and safety of @entity11 employees			1
' @entity11 has carried out its own investigation into the circumstances surrounding this health and safety hazard			1
' we will also consider whilst completing the risk assessment what steps need to be taken to ensure employee safety before we can restore mail deliveries to your address			1
' ' concern ' : the housing association which manages some of the properties said it has taken steps to address the infestation ' hazard ' : the @entity11 postman 's arms and legs were covered in flea - bites after he made deliveries at the @entity7 in @entity33 ( file photo ) @entity186 , customer manager at @entity131 which own some of the houses , said that it was unusual for them to become involved in cases like this as it was a tenants responsibility to deal with infestations			1
