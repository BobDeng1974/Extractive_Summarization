@entity0 splashed the cash during the summer in an attempt to fire themselves back into @entity5 contention after their seventh - placed finish last season			1
new manager @entity9 spent £ 150m to overhaul the squad at @entity11 , bringing in the likes of @entity13 and @entity14 among others			1
with no fewer than six new arrivals to bed in ahead of this weekend 's game against @entity20 , we asked our team of experts what they think @entity25 's strongest team is ( assuming everyone is fit			1
) @entity27 @entity28 @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 four at the back offers a more solid base for all the attacking forces			2
@entity35 in to sit and control			2
legs from @entity38 and @entity29			2
and what a front three			2
sadly no room for @entity40 , a wonderful player , but he can be involved behind two strikers with a slight tweak to 4 - 3 - 1 - 2			2
you can like our @entity0 facebook page here arrival : @entity48 striker @entity13 joined @entity0 on loan from @entity50 on transfer deadline day @entity27 @entity52 @entity29 @entity30 @entity53 still not sure about the key full - back areas and @entity28 is a mistake waiting to happen every game			1
@entity35 , playing very deep and dropping to make an auxiliary centre back / front sweeper is key to this			2
@entity40 slows down the game too much			2
the front three could be explosive , if they can fit together			2
i ’ve gone for @entity79 at right back because i simply do n’t trust @entity28			2
but the forward line , with @entity71 playing a number 10 role , is packed with pace and ability			2
this is a team that should score more goals than it concedes			0
in and out : @entity40 has struggled to cement a place in the team since his big - money move from @entity90 @entity27 @entity91 @entity70 @entity92 @entity13 @entity93 even though it ’s an attacking line - up , there ’s no room for @entity30			1
on current form , he would be used off the bench			0
the system depends on two things : the front three of @entity71 , @entity40 and @entity29 being inter-changeable , and @entity102 and @entity28 being more defensively responsible			0
otherwise , i would n’t fancy facing this lot			0
competition : @entity107 's first - team place is under threat after the arrival of @entity13 @entity27 @entity79 @entity110 @entity111 @entity112 @entity113 try and play around with the names @entity0 have available and you will see that for all razzmatazz up front , the defence would n't fill you with great confidence			1
they might score goals but they are going to concede a few along the way until @entity25 's methods begin to work			1
they could n't slip up against @entity20 with those options , could they ? skipper : @entity71 has struggled to make his mark after being named as @entity0 captain @entity27 @entity129 @entity35 @entity130 @entity40 @entity131 @entity132 take a leaf out of @entity135 's book and play with a diamond to get the best out of attacking players			1
the problem is @entity71 , arguably @entity0 's best all - round player but master of none			1
is he specifically a better creative number 10 than @entity40 ? but he would be first reserve if anyone is tired , injured or suspended			0
fitting in : @entity145 was one of @entity0 's first signings in the transfer window from @entity148 @entity27 @entity129 @entity149 @entity150 @entity13 @entity151 ditch the back three - @entity25 has played with four for much of his career so there 's no need to continue with a vanity project			1
@entity156 will have to take a back seat for now and @entity107 and @entity40 will have to learn how to be super subs			0
just get the right shape and the best 11 on the pitch and worry about reputations later			0
ideally @entity35 would play in holding midfield when back from injury			0
switch : @entity166 @entity165 poses at @entity167 after joining @entity0 from @entity168 @entity27 @entity28 @entity169 @entity71 @entity170 @entity171 this system best accommodates the almost embarrassment of riches @entity0 have in attack			1
@entity71 reverting to the no 10 role allows for @entity13 's inclusion and could suit him better as he ages and loses the electrifying burst of pace he once had			1
four at back is stronger			0
@entity40 is the one to miss out			0
moving on : striker @entity182 was sold to @entity183 for £ 16million on transfer deadline day @entity27 @entity28 blind @entity186 @entity170 @entity187 with that many forward options , @entity0 need to revert to @entity190 's hyper - attacking formation of last season to get the most out of them			1
even then , there is still no place in my side for new - boy @entity29			0
@entity40 gets the nod for me , to give him a chance to return to the devastating form he produced in the no 10 role for @entity90			0
@entity145 is also sacrificed in that formation , with @entity38 's defensive ability required over @entity145 's diverse passing range			1
it also opens up a space for @entity186 on the left wing			0
he is one of the brightest young talents in world football , so it is astounding he 's not first choice already			2
@entity71 is forced into the right of the three attacking midfielders behind the strikers , but i feel his future lies further back			0
home : @entity216 ( right ) ended his @entity11 stay to return to @entity217 and @entity218 @entity27 @entity28 blind @entity220 @entity131 @entity221 this system is a defensive risk but @entity38 performs the screening role ahead of the back four excellently , and would allow the likes of @entity29 and @entity145 scope to get forward to do damage			1
those two up front would scare the daylights out of any centre - backs and @entity71 can pull the strings			0
@entity28 needs to get fit and @entity28 produce consistency but they are full - backs of quality			0
@entity110 sneaks in ahead of @entity110 after his @entity236 horror show			0
condition : @entity156 has been hampered by fitness and injury problems since moving from @entity240 @entity27 @entity28 @entity241 @entity170 @entity242 forget three at the back , it ’s had its summer of love , it would be a winter of depression if @entity25 persisted with it			1
and forget @entity71 , he ’s become a problem for club and country , an angry man who knows his powers are – pardon the pun – on the wane			0
the back four picks itself but the two who miss out in midfield are @entity145 and @entity40			0
@entity145 looks a class act , admittedly , but @entity35 will be more like the player of two seasons ago with the likes of @entity29 and @entity13 to feed off his cunning creativity			1
blind provides a little bit more know - how in the middle of the park and that allows @entity186 and @entity29 to terrorise down the flanks			0
@entity30 and @entity13 could be devastating as a pair , do n’t complicate it by trying to accommodate @entity71			1
sliding in : new signing @entity276 ( right ) in action for @entity278 in a friendly against @entity280 @entity27 @entity28 @entity35 @entity281 @entity170 @entity282 this emphasises @entity25 ’s riches from midfield up and dearth of options in defence			1
you ’d ideally want a better right - back and another better , more consistent centre - half , at least one			0
as it is , a shield is crucial , @entity35 in this case with the huge proviso he 's at his peak			2
@entity71 would have license to roam in the central role of the three			0
other choices there abound - @entity149 , @entity40 and @entity145 foremost among them			0
plenty to ponder : @entity9 is without a win in his first four games as @entity0 manager @entity27 @entity91 @entity169 @entity71 @entity170 @entity306 @entity25 will have to make the best out of a poor selection of defenders			1
he can keep the marauding full - backs of @entity102 and @entity28 , but @entity311 and @entity110 will have to form a decent partnership – quickly			0
the signing of @entity38 should add a bite to midfield previously lacking , while he can also drop into a back three if the full - backs are bombing on			0
attacking-wise is clearly a different story - @entity29 can add creativity from a midfield position while @entity71 will also drop deep , leaving @entity30 and @entity13 as the deadliest duo in the league			1
@entity40 will be the odd man out and see his second consecutive january transfer			0
blow : @entity324 scored the winner for @entity326 in a 2 - 1 win at @entity11 on the opening day lagging behind : @entity0 have just two points from their first three @entity5 games @entity27 @entity330 @entity331 @entity70 @entity29 @entity112 @entity332 there is no room for @entity40 in the side , no matter how you look at it			1
it 's also near impossible to see how @entity71 , @entity30 and @entity13 can all play together			1
given that @entity71 got the nod to captain @entity0 over @entity25 , one has to assume @entity30 is now third choice			1
with @entity311 and @entity110 doing the dirty work either side of him , @entity35 could be developed into a sweeper and linchpin of @entity25 's 3 - 5 - 2			1
@entity346 wo n't win the title - @entity347			2

@entity0 have spent £ *150million* this summer
@entity9 has signed six players in an attempt to overhaul his squad
@entity13 and @entity14 among big signings at @entity11
united without a win in @entity25 's first four games as manager
