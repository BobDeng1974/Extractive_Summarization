@entity2 fear @entity0 will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in @entity6			1
and their worries look set to be realised with @entity10 planning to slap a £ 35million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors , while the north @entity16 club are determined not to sell the @entity17 to a domestic rival			2
@entity2 are considering a move for the @entity21 goalkeeper as fears grow over a @entity24 's future , while he is also a long - term target for @entity26			1
@entity6 has established himself as one of the @entity29 's top keepers with some fine displays spurs are determined to keep @entity6 at @entity32 and will put a £ 35million price tag on his head but @entity10 are determined to keep their no 1 at @entity32 and will demand a sky - high price for the keeper			1
the current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the £ 32.6million @entity41 paid @entity42 for @entity43 in 2001			0
but @entity10 chairman @entity0 values @entity6 even higher than that fee and wo n't consider any offers for a penny under £ 35million			0
and it is for that reason @entity2 , despite their interest , are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch			0
@entity0 ( right ) , alongside @entity10 owner @entity53 , is known to drive a hard bargain @entity43 is the world 's most expensive keeper after his £ 32.6m move from @entity42 to @entity41 in 2001 @entity0 is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in @entity59 and will not let @entity6 leave on someone else 's terms			2
his reputation for getting maximum value from the club 's assets was underlined when @entity66 paid a world record £ 85million for @entity68 after a summer of hardball tactics from @entity0			0
and the @entity10 supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep @entity6 , who signed a five - year deal last summer .			1

@entity6 has established himself as one of the @entity29 's best keepers
with *uncertainty* over @entity24 's future , @entity2 and @entity26 are interested
@entity6 signed a five - year deal with @entity10 last year
and @entity0 will put price tag on @entity6 to keep @entity2 and @entity26 at *bay*
