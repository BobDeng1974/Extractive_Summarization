by @entity0 published : 05:19 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 05:55 est , 17 march 2014 a couple told they were unlikely to ever have children - even with the help of @entity6 - have spoken of their joy at becoming parents			1
@entity10 , 36 , and her husband @entity11 , overcame 250,000 - to - one odds to conceive naturally			1
they were devastated when mr @entity14 , 39 , was diagnosed with teratozoospermia , a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped			1
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ the doctor said there was a very remote chance we could conceive , but that the odds were more than 250,000 - to - one			1
@entity10 and @entity14 overcame odds of 250,000 - to - one to conceive baby @entity24 naturally ‘ the issue was that @entity11 ’s sperm cells could n’t fuse with my eggs			1
it was a practical problem and there was n’t much we could do about it			0
‘ there was the option to try a special form of @entity6 which would track down one suitable sperm cell and inject it into the egg			1
but the problem was finding the sperm			2
‘ it would have been a lengthy process and quite invasive on my body , so we decided the odds were just too much for us			2
‘ we had just started the six - month interview process for adoption when i found out i was pregnant			1
i did n’t believe it at first			0
’ their son @entity24 is now 15 months old			2
mr and mrs @entity10 , from @entity46 - on - @entity47 , @entity48 , started planning for a family soon after they married in 2007			1
the couple were told that even @entity6 would be difficult because mr @entity14 has a condition which causes his sperm to be abnormally shaped			1
they were going through the adoption process when @entity24 was conceived @entity24 was born healthy in december 2012 and is now a thriving 15 - month - old mr @entity14 said : ‘ i was the one pushing for children			1
i ’d always wanted to be a dad and i brought up the subject in conversation quite frequently			0
‘ as we started to settle down , @entity10 became enthusiastic about the idea			2
’ mrs @entity10 said : ‘ we were on holiday when we realised that we wanted a child of our own to be with us and share the experience			1
’ @entity65 is a condition which causes sperm to be abnormally shaped			2
it is often associated with infertility			0
in most cases , the cause of the abnormally shaped sperm is not known			2
however , it can be caused by @entity74 's disease , coeliac disease and @entity77 's disease			0
the abnormal sperm make traditional @entity6 unlikely to succeed but some patients can benefit from @entity80 ( @entity80 )			1
this is a type of @entity6 that involves selecting a single , healthy , sperm and injecting it directly into an egg in an effort to succesfully fertilise it			1
but after two years of trying , the couple realised something was wrong			0
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ @entity65 is quite rare			1
the doctor had n’t heard of it - she had to look it up in a book before she could talk to us			2
‘ we got used to the idea that natural conception just was n’t going to happen			0
but the ivf being suggested seemed quite invasive and a huge effort , and it was not likely to be successful in any case			2
’ mr @entity14 said : ‘ it was a difficult time for me			1
women are often expected to be the ones who are devastated if fertility becomes an issue - men are expected to be shoulders to cry on			2
but our case was often the opposite			0
‘ i thought it was my problem and it was quite a lonely place to be , with the way society treats the issue			0
‘ women get sympathy , but men with fertility problems are somehow supposed to stand there and accept that it ’s their fault			0
it becomes a point of ridicule			0
‘ there ’s an idea that you ’re not even a real man if you ca n’t create children			0
men need to be much more open in talking about these issues and how it affects them			0
’ mrs @entity10 said : ‘ we realised we wanted children , but the child did n’t need to be ours biologically			1
' we got our thoughts together and decided to go for adoption , even though the process was very full - on			1
’ but then , five months into the process , mrs @entity10 missed a period and took a pregnancy test			1
mrs @entity10 said : ' to find out i had conceived naturally against such odds was very strange			1
we were surprised and delighted ' she said : ‘ i ended up taking three tests at home , and a further test at my gp			0
only then did i believe that i was actually pregnant			0
we were in " adoption mode ” , so to find out i had conceived naturally against such odds was very strange			2
we were surprised and delighted			0
’ there were nervous moments during the 26 - hour labour in december 2012			1
mrs @entity10 ’s contractions were unpredictable and @entity24 had to be delivered with forceps when his heart rate dropped			1
then , after the delivery , mrs @entity10 needed surgery to remove part of the placenta			1
but after five days in hospital , the family was able to return home and start their longed - for life together			2
mr @entity14 said : ‘ i thought i would be crying with joy when @entity24 arrived , but i felt a quiet , cautious relief that they were both ok			1
it was only when they both came home that we were relaxed enough to experience the joy of being parents for the first time			0
’ the couple are urging other people with fertility problems not to give up as ' good things can , and do , happen ' today , mr @entity14 , a chef , looks after @entity24 at home while mrs @entity10 works as a college science lecturer			1
he said : ‘ it ’s brilliant - but it comes with challenges			2
he ’s at the moment where he ’s learning to walk , pulling books and cds from the shelves , so he needs constant watching			0
‘ i take him to the library every day			0
he charms everyone he meets - i love taking him out and showing him off to everyone			2
’ mrs @entity10 said : ‘ the best moment was when the midwife gave me @entity24 after the labour			1
i felt his skin on mine			0
i remember that moment so vividly			0
i felt a joy which is impossible to describe			0
‘ @entity24 ’s brilliant - he smiles all the time and has a healthy appetite			1
i feel incredibly close to him , considering all we went through			0
we had three years of uncertainty and all of a sudden we have a baby boy			0
every day we reflect on how lucky we are to have him			0
‘ it makes me think about other couples who are facing difficulties and heartache with fertility problems			0
‘ do n’t give up hope - good things can , and do , happen			0
