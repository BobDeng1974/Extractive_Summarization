it just would n't be @entity1 without turkey , tinsel and top politicians ' desperately trying to say something about themselves with their official festive cards			1
once again we have @entity8 posing outside @entity9 and @entity10 posing with his children			2
but @entity12 - not used to winning much these days - must surely be judged to have the best card this year , posing in a @entity15 hat in a series of photobooth snaps with wife @entity18 in a festive jumper			1
this year is especially important , with just five months to go until the general election			0
mr @entity12 , who in the past has asked his three sons to design his card , has chosen an offbeat series of passport photo - style images with his wife			0
the couple are shown in four shots , with the deputy prime minister donning a @entity15 hat before holding up a sign saying ' @entity1 ! '			1
prime minister @entity8 and his wife @entity44 as they pose for a picture outside 10 @entity47 in @entity48 with @entity49 on their card @entity10 's card shows the @entity53 leader with his children @entity55 ( aged 5 ) @entity56 ( aged 4 ) and wife @entity57 as they made @entity1 cards for their family at their home in @entity48 by contrast , mr @entity8 has once again opted for a picture with his wife @entity44 outside the door to @entity9			1
they are seen posing in @entity47 with @entity49 before hosting a reception for the war veterans held in july			0
mr @entity10 , who hopes to take the keys of @entity9 in may next year , again chooses an informal portrait of his family , with wife @entity57 and their sons @entity55 , aged 5 , @entity56 , 4			2
they are seen making @entity1 cards at their home in @entity48			1
it is not easy to get these things right			0
when @entity79 's card was released this week , it was met with ridicule			2
the picture , which was shared online , provoked widespread mirth for the awkwardness of their pose , the lack of festive cheer and most bizarrely of all mr @entity79 's teeth			1
in the photo , @entity89 appears to have attempted to portray a softer look , wearing a scooped neck red dress and matching ruby accessories she leans into her husband , resting one hand on his chest			0
but @entity79 obviously did n't get that message , his smile appearing to have been held frozen for too long in the glare of the camera and turned into a rather aggressive grimace			0
critics also noted his apparently un-ironed open necked shirt			0
@entity8 2013 : @entity8 and @entity105 chose this image with daughter @entity107 for their card last year 2012 : in the year of the @entity111 , the @entity110 opted for a photo of the @entity113 outside @entity9 being carried by @entity114 2011 : a photograph of the @entity8 's celebrating the royal wedding at a street party outside @entity9 2010 : @entity8 surprised her parents by arriving early in september 2010 , and featured on that year 's @entity1 card 2013 : @entity10 and wife @entity57 have made a habit of choosing family portraits with sons @entity55 ( right ) and @entity56 ( left ) , including this picture taken at the @entity53 conference in @entity125 2012 : the @entity126 posed at their home in @entity48 for this informal portrait 2011 : mr @entity10 's card was decorated with red snowflakes and a simple black and white photo of him with wife @entity57 and children @entity55 and @entity134 2010 : in his first card after becoming @entity53 leader , mr @entity10 chose this black and white photograph , featuring baby @entity134 who was born that year 2013 : an informal photograph of @entity12 and wife @entity18 was given a festive touch by their three sons , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 2012 : the seasonal collage featuring @entity146 and a snowman was designed by by eight - year - old @entity148 after a competition 2011 : this felt pen festivity was once again the work of @entity143 and @entity144 2010 : the @entity154 ' 2010 @entity1 card , again drawn by their children , may have given away rather a lot about life at home			1
