an @entity1 woman has spoken out in a @entity2 about why she and her @entity4 husband made the painful decision to have a legal abortion at 23 weeks			1
when the couple learned that their unborn daughter had a chromosomal defect ' incompatible with life outside the womb ' , they decided that terminating the pregnancy was the best course of action			1
' i am pro-choice because i am pro-life , ' the woman , who has chosen to remain anonymous , said			1
' my little girl would never have [ had ] a life , and attempting to give her that could take mine away in the process			2
' sad decision : after an amniocentesis , the @entity1 woman found out that her unborn daughter found out that her daughter would n't survive outside the womb , and she chose to get an abortion the anonymous couple was happy to learn that they were expecting last december			1
in march , they were looking forward to the 20 - week anatomy scan			0
but the woman had a gut feeling something was n't right			1
at about five months along , she was n't showing yet , and though her family assured it was just because she had an athletic body , she explained : ' things just felt wrong , felt off			2
' her fears proved to be right			0
on april 1 , she and her husband went to her @entity41 for the planned anatomy scan			2
they found out they were having a girl - but at the same time discovered that the fetus was much smaller than it should have been at that time			0
she was referred to another hospital with a specialized fetal medicine center where , two weeks later , an amniocentesis test showed that the fetus had @entity52 , a chromosomal defect that is ' incompatible with life outside the womb '			1
they learned that their unborn daughter had 69 chromosomes instead of the normal 46 , an abnormality that also resulted in @entity60			1
the fetus also had a diaphragmatic hernia and severely stunted growth , weighing 8oz when she should have weighed just over a pound			0
these major health issues also meant there were risks for the mother			2
the fetus was so small that it could have died in the womb without the woman knowing , which could have resulted in an infection			1
the mother was also at a higher risk for preeclampsia , a blood pressure - related pregnancy complication that can be fatal			2
she also noted that her placenta could have ruptured , leaving her to ' bleed out in my bathtub faster than anyone could help me '			0
with the knowledge that her health was at risk and her child would be unable to live , the woman and her husband made the decision to terminate the pregnancy			1
it was n't an easy choice			2
the couple had already picked out a name , @entity95			2
and the woman added that the decision was especially hard for her husband , who grew up @entity4			1
still , he agreed , carrying the child to term was n't worth the risk to his wife 's health			1
in their state of @entity1 , abortion is legal until 24 weeks - but that does n't compel all doctors to perform them			1
at the age of 23 weeks , the average baby is the size of a large mango			0
the woman tracked down the only doctor in her city who offered abortions			2
but because he practiced within a @entity4 institution , he had to seek special approval from the ceo and the ethics board , explaining that that the woman 's child would n't survive and that there were dangers in letting the pregnancy progress naturally			1
she was approved for the abortion , and quickly started taking steps toward having the procedure			0
' my doctors were honest and clear about the situation , ' she said			0
' they used explicit terms and did n't dance around the issue			0
during the different procedures they walked me through exactly what they were doing , but at the same time , they were very empathetic and understanding			0
' first , she had to have three to four sticks of laminaria , a form of kelp , inserted into her cervix to begin dilation , which she describes as ' pretty uncomfortable '			0
after going home for the night , where she experienced cramping , the woman went back to the clinic with her husband the next day to have the 45 - minute procedure under general anaesthesia			1
' [ our baby ] passed painlessly inside me and was never alone , ' the woman said , adding that their daughter will be be cremated , and the ashes will be spread over garden at hospital			1
also called @entity167 , @entity52 is a chromosomal disorder characterized by having three of every chromosome - so infants affected have a total of 69 chromosomes rather than the standard 46			0
babies with @entity175 are often lost through miscarriage			0
those that survive usually die within the first five months of life			0
the rare disorder also causes babies to be much smaller than average , and often results in birth defects			0
source : @entity185 the woman said that she and her husband are still grieving and experience bouts of ' spontaneous sobbing '			1
she wonders how @entity189 , which is on may 10 , will feel and how she 'll cope on the baby 's due date , but she knows that she and her husband made the right decision			1
' i do n't regret it , ' she said			1
' my other option was to wait for her to pass naturally , but the risks were too high			0
' she does , however , wish people would stop telling her that ' the next baby will be just fine ' ; she explained that though she and her husband do plan to try again , they are still dealing with the loss of this baby			2
' i 'm facing this head - on and telling people about it no - holds - barred , ' she expained , because she knows she is not the only woman to go through this			0
' because it does happen , a lot , and we should n't be afraid to talk about it			0

the @entity1 woman revealed on @entity2 that her unborn daughter 's dangerous condition would have left her unable to live outside the womb
*potential* complications from the pregnancy put the anonymous mother 's life in danger
she and her @entity4 husband had to get special approval for a doctor at @entity4 hospital to perform the procedure
