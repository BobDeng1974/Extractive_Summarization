while working as a berry picker in 2009 , the 46 - year - old got into a dispute with a group of @entity19 women who objected to her drinking their water because , as a @entity2 , she was considered ' unclean '			2
as a result of the initial allegations , the family were savagely beaten by angry villagers at their house and forced to go into hiding after receiving death threats			1

shocking : christian woman @entity10 , pictured , has seen her appeal against the death sentence denied when she asked one of her attackers for water , they instead smashed the glass against the wall to torment her			1
' they dragged her to the centre of the village			0
we both were crying but there was nobody to listen to us			0
' after half an hour or so , the police came and my mother asked me to go and find my father , who was hiding at my uncle 's house			1
' but he was too terrified to leave			0
i ran back and by that time police had taken my mother away			2
' ms @entity10 's husband , @entity95 , said his other daughter , 15 - year - old @entity38 who has special needs , had also been abused			1
' all those people who abused and tortured my wife knew me very well , but they did not respect anything , ' he told @entity32 at his house in a @entity2 district of @entity103			1
' they became so cruel			0
they even did n't spare my daughters and tortured them			2
bowing his head in shame , mr @entity37 said : ' i was so afraid that day			1
' i do not think it could have helped her or our family if i had tried to save her that day			1
' i might also have ended up in jail as a blasphemy - accused and there would be no one to help my daughters			2
' mr @entity37 , who used to work at brick kiln as a labourer in his village , said their lives have been destroyed			1
' i was born in that village			0
i spent almost 45 years of my life in that village			0
i had so many friends in that village but i do not want to go back there			0
' ' i have restricted my movement			0
i am afraid of being recognised as @entity128 's husband in public			0
' i have almost stopped communicating with @entity19			0
i am afraid they could recognise me			0
just imagine how tough it will be for my wife to live in prison			0
' in november 2010 ms @entity10 was sentenced to death by a lower court , becoming the first woman in @entity3 's history to be given the death penalty for blasphemy			1
over the past four years ms @entity10 has languished in the high - security @entity140 , 22 miles north - west of @entity103 , before being moved to a more remote prison			1
terrified : ms @entity10 's husband , @entity95 , said the family has been forced into hiding over fears for their lives despair : the family has launched a second court appeal against ms @entity10 's death sentence the shocking case hit global headlines after two prominent politicians who tried to help ms @entity10 were assassinated , one by his own bodyguard			1
lawyers showered the killer with rose petals when he appeared in court and the judge who convicted him of murder had to flee the country			2
ms @entity10 's lawyer , @entity163 , said her accusers have contradicted themselves many times since first raising their complaint			1
two witnesses allegedly involved in the incident did not appear in court , he said			2
a muslim prayer leader did appear , saying he did not witness the original altercation , but that ms @entity10 had confessed to the supposed crime in front of him			1
last week , despite international outrage and hundreds of thousands of people signing a petition for her release , ms @entity10 lost an appeal to have her sentence overturned , meaning she now faces death by hanging			1
the family have forced to move five times in the last five years because of the abuse they have suffered the decision of the @entity187 has thrust the family back into public spotlight , placing their safety in jeopardy once again			2
' this is too dangerous for all of us ' , said mr @entity37			1
' we have changed five residences during the last five years			0
the blasphemy accusation on my wife has ruined our family			2
' i could not sleep properly after the decision of the @entity187			0
we could be attacked or framed in similar kind of case			0
' human rights groups say @entity3 's blasphemy law is increasingly exploited by religious extremists as well as ordinary @entity3 to settle personal scores			0
the law does not define blasphemy and evidence might not be reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence			2
there are also no penalties for false accusations			0
those accused are sometimes lynched on the spot			2
if they are arrested , police and the courts often allow trials to drag on for years , as in the case of ms @entity10			1
the delays tend to be caused because officials are afraid of being physically attacked if they release anyone they feel had been wrongly accused of blasphemy			2
only one person has been executed since @entity3 imposed a de facto moratorium on executions in 2008			0
this year has seen a record number of blasphemy cases as well as increasing violence against the accused			2
support : @entity232 , husband of @entity10 , along with his daughters @entity234 , second left , and @entity37 , left , speak to @entity3 minister of minority affairs @entity235 , right			1
he was later murdered anger : protesters hold up placards while demanding the release of mrs @entity10 at a rally in @entity103 in 2010 the crime of blasphemy was sealed into @entity3 law under @entity245 rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator @entity246 , who died in a plane crash in 1988			1
in recent years , however , the country - which is 96 per cent @entity19 - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting @entity44 , says @entity252 - based think - tank , the @entity253			0
but many analysts see the claims as score - settling or a front for property grabs , and in fact have nothing to do with @entity44			0
if found guilty , defendants can expect the death penalty			0
the charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement			0
it can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime			1
@entity272 carries the death penalty in @entity3 but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them			1
judges have previously been attacked in @entity3 for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead			0
ms @entity10 - a farm worker from rural @entity282 - released a memoir called ' @entity272 ' last year , in which she described her torment at not knowing how long she has left to live			1

' my wife was framed in the charge of blasphemy only because of her faith			0
' the day our house was attacked by an angry mob at our village , she was offered to convert to @entity44 to get out of trouble but she denied as she has not committed any crime			1
' there is no pressure on her in jail to convert to @entity44			0
authorities , in fact , are somewhat helpful , ' he said that he was hopeful to get justice from the @entity312			0
he has called on the @entity313 and president @entity314 to help secure the release of his wife			0
' we need help from all quarters			0
@entity314 should play a positive role and convince @entity3 government to ensure justice in @entity128 's case			0
' the family have struggled to look after @entity38 , who has difficulties with her speech and walking , after her mother 's arrest			2
speaking in broken words , @entity38 said : ' i miss my mother too much			0
' both sisters go to a private school being run by @entity334 , executive director @entity335 , a @entity2 educationist who has been helping the family since december 2010			2
