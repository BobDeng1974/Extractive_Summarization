the @entity0 has refused to get involved in a row brewing at @entity2 , @entity3 where the on - base spouses club has refused membership to the lesbian spouse of a female @entity10 lieutenant , a @entity0 spokesman said wednesday			1
last month @entity11 , the newlywed wife of lt. col. @entity12 , was blocked from joining the club at @entity2			1
she was told she could n’t be admitted because she lacked a military spouse id card , a rule only enacted after she asked to join			0
the move sparked accusations that @entity18 was being prevented from joining simply because she is a lesbian			1
modern family : @entity11 , right , the same - sex wife of lt colonel @entity12 , left , has been denied membership of @entity2 's military spouses ' club speaking out after the @entity0 ’s decision not to get overrule the club , @entity18 said she was extremely disappointed by the disregard of both officials at @entity2 and at the @entity29 to the continued discrimination against gays and lesbians despite the repeal of ' @entity34 ' in 2011			1
‘ this is no longer about me joining this officers club			2
this is about the @entity0 and the @entity0 and the @entity37 telling the country that it is ok to discriminate against gay and lesbian service members and their families , ’ she told @entity35			2
‘ this is not the end			0
i ’m not going to drop this			0
i ’m not going to sit back and take the discrimination when i know good and well the @entity0 and secretary of defense can sign rights today that would also authorize military ids and extend housing ( to the same - sex spouses of service members ) , ’ she said			2
happy family : the couple have been together 15 years , they share a two - year - old boy and have another baby on the way the legal basis for the @entity0 ’s stance is a department - wide ‘ instruction ’ drafted in 2008			2
it ensures that ‘ non-federal entities ’ operating on @entity74 military installations do n’t discriminate on the basis of ‘ race , color , creed , sex , age , disability , or national origin , ’ but makes no mention of discrimination based on sexual orientation			1
‘ the officer @entity79 at @entity2 is in compliance with the @entity0 instruction , ’ said @entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity0			1
‘ when you look at the instruction there are a few things it has to meet			0
as long as they meet those criteria , they ’re allowed to meet on the base			0
’ the @entity10 ’s handling of that matter runs counter to a directive issued jan. 9 by @entity96 leaders who ordered that same - sex spouses be allowed to participate in spouses clubs at all @entity96 bases			2
however the @entity0 's position on the @entity2 matter is legally viable because the @entity0 still follows the 1996 @entity102 ( @entity102 ) , which defines marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman			1
@entity18 married her partner of 15 years , lt colonel @entity12 , in november after the repeal of ' @entity34 ' policy banning openly gay service members from the military			1
the newlyweds have a two - year - old son , and @entity115 is now eight months pregnant with the couple 's second child			0
' after " @entity34 , " i thought , wow , i can finally be part of something , finally give back to the military community in ways other than just writing a check			2
so it was a blow			0
here , i thought things were progressing			0
i was knocked back down , ' said @entity18			0
unofficial club : the @entity128 is located in @entity2 , @entity3 , but it is not directly affiliated with the @entity0 in an open letter to the spouses group in december , @entity18 wrote about her commitment to the military , saying that she has been to every one of her wife ’s promotion ceremonies and endured every deployment			1
in the letter , @entity18 said that she has been a valuable member of the military community , tutoring @entity10 children in reading and volunteering her time with @entity142 assisting soldiers in finding homes for their pets while they serve overseas – activities that make her an ideal candidate for membership in the club			1
the @entity128 is a non-profit organization , which means that it is not directly affiliated with the @entity0			0
@entity151 suggested that the club 's status gives it legal leeway to discriminate against applicants like @entity18			1
‘ they are part of and affiliated , by definition , with @entity2			0
they need to understand the @entity10 and the military ’s directive on this by the repeal of “ @entity34			1
” they need to step in line with that , ’ she said			0
@entity151 has accused club president @entity167 of imposing her personal homophobic beliefs on the organization and called on her to step down .			0

@entity11 , the wife of lt. col. @entity12 , was blocked from joining the wives club at @entity2 last month
the @entity0 says the club has **n't** done anything wrong because it has acted in compliance with the @entity0 's instruction
that instruction *predates* ' @entity34 ' and does **n't** yet outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation
@entity18 has accused the @entity10 of continued discrimination against gays and lesbians
