the @entity0 have opened a full - scale investigation in an attempt to find the culprit who launched a coin at @entity6 in @entity8 ’s draw with @entity9 - and want a lengthy ban for anyone found guilty			1
they are working with @entity9 and analysing @entity14 footage of the @entity15 when a member of the crowd , which holds @entity9 fans , threw an object which struck @entity6 as he celebrated @entity8 ’s goal			1
@entity9 stewards and staff at the club will also be questioned to provide eye - witness accounts of what happened			1
the @entity0 want anyone found guilty of the offence to face a lengthy ban from the game			1
a similar incident happened last season when @entity52 was pelted by objects from the same stand at @entity30			1
provided clubs provide adequate stewarding for their matches and have @entity14 to monitor any disturbances , the @entity0 feel it is impossible to stop fans from turning up and throwing objects from the stands			2
@entity8 manager @entity62 claimed afterwards that the coin could have left his player blinded			2
‘ i have seen it and it misses @entity69 ’s eye by an inch – another inch and it could blind him , @entity62 said			0
‘ you ca n’t have that in this game			0
i hope the authorities deal with it and i ’m sure they will because it will be on tv every other minute and rightly so			0
let ’s find out who it was and sort it out			0
‘ it just ca n’t happen , can it ? it has got to be taken out of the game			0
what is disappointing from @entity9 ’s point of view is that they have an unbelievable crowd here , an unbelievable atmosphere – it is a fanatical group of supporters in that corner			2
but it takes one idiot to throw a coin			0
’ stewards look for any objects thrown onto the pitch at @entity30 as one finds a coin on the turf ( centre ) one official shows his colleague the coin having found the object that was thrown at @entity6 on wednesday here you can see the coin that officials found after @entity8 captain @entity6 was struck in the face @entity8 head coach @entity62 was left fuming after his captain was struck by a coin at @entity30			1
