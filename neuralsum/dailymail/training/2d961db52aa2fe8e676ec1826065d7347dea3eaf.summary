@entity0 will take to the field in the @entity2 against @entity3 on monday without their record goalscorer - and @entity6 's absence creates a curious stat for the @entity9 football team			1
when you think of the @entity9 national side , you immediately think of the likes of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
yet , for the first time in 221 matches , @entity0 will line - up for a match without a player whose surname starts with ' @entity21 '			1
and , as the @entity56 striker is the only ' @entity21 ' in their @entity58 @entity2 squad , @entity23 's side will start with a vanless xi for the first time in 18 years			1
the last time the @entity61 did not have a ' @entity21 ' on the field was when they beat @entity63 2 - 0 on may 29 , 1996			1
interestingly , @entity0 will still be managed by a ' @entity21 ' in the form of @entity65 , but he will be unable to name any players bearing that name in his squad for the @entity3 encounter			1
@entity15 ( goalkeeper ) - 130 caps ( 1995 - 2008 ) there can only be one choice in goal for this five - a - side team and it has to be @entity15			2
during a glittering career he won the @entity78 with both @entity79 and @entity56 , as well as eight league titles			0
he also holds the world league clean sheet record after going 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal for @entity56 during the 2008 - 09 season			0
you would n't be scoring a lob past him , that 's for sure ... stopper : @entity9 goalkeeper @entity15 ( left ) played for @entity56 and @entity79 during his career save : @entity15 kept a world league clean sheet record of 1,311 minutes for @entity56 in 2008 - 09 @entity44 ( attacking midfielder ) - 109 caps , 25 goals ( 2001 - ) this five - a - side team is all about goals , goals and yet more goals			1
you 'll find very little defending in it			0
@entity44 is a wonderfully gifted midfielder who has played for @entity79 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 - and he can provide the assists for the deadly front three here			0
he would have been in the @entity0 squad but a calf injury curtailed his involvement			2
will have to do all the tracking back in this side mind ... creative : @entity44 is an extremely skilful player who scores goals and provides assists @entity6 ( striker ) - 86 caps , 46 goals ( 2005 - ) what needs to be said about @entity6 that has n't already ? the @entity56 striker is his country 's record goalscorer with 46 goals and he has terrorised defences in the @entity120 for years			2
after banging goals in left , right and centre for @entity123 for no reward , he finally won a league title under sir @entity126 in 2012 - 13			0
already has three goals at this @entity2 , and expect more when he returns from his enforced rest			0
absence : @entity36 will not play against @entity3 on monday after picking up two yellow cards amazing : @entity36 's opening goal of the tournament showed incredible improvisation for @entity0 @entity14 ( striker ) - 70 caps , 35 goals ( 1998 - 2011 ) in our midfield / front three , @entity6 is accompanied by the deadly @entity9 finisher that is @entity14			1
@entity140 , @entity101 , @entity100 , @entity141 and @entity56 were among the clubs for who @entity14 fired in endless goals , bringing him five league titles			0
from inside the penalty area , has there ever been a finisher more clinical ? expect very little movement around the court though ... clinical : @entity14 was a poacher who scored goals for fun throughout his career @entity13 ( striker ) - 58 caps , 24 goals ( 1983 - 1992 ) six league titles , two @entity159 and the 1988 @entity160 hardly seem enough reward for a striker of such supreme talent			0
injury prematurely brought to an end a fantastic career for a player who shone on the field for @entity79 , @entity169 and @entity0			2
he scored 277 goals throughout his career and many of them spectacular , most memorably his volley against the @entity175 during the 1988 @entity160 final in @entity177			0
no team of ' @entity21 ' would be complete without him , even if he is injured			2
expect truly special goals on the court from this man			0
class : @entity0 's @entity13 is one of the greatest strikers to have ever played the game simply the best : @entity13 's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion @entity44 's enforced @entity2 absence due to a calf injury ensured that only @entity36 took to field as a ' @entity21 '			1
it is likely that @entity36 's absence will hit the @entity9 hard as they face a @entity3 side who have taken the @entity2 by storm			1
both teams head into the match with two wins from two games , and @entity36 's three goals have helped the @entity9 dispose of @entity51 and @entity52			2
however , with @entity203 also having scored three times in @entity58 already , @entity0 do have another @entity2 player at their disposal			0
@entity0 only need a draw to top @entity208 , but a win for either side would set up a likely quarter - final tie with @entity212 , whereas the loser would probably be forced to take on hosts @entity58			1
the match takes place at the @entity41 in @entity42			0
@entity217 : with @entity36 suspended , @entity203 will need to continue his goalscoring form goals : @entity203 has already netted three times for @entity0 at the @entity221 in @entity58 high five : @entity36 ( left ) slaps the hand of coach @entity65 after scoring against @entity51 double vision : @entity36 ( right ) is suspended but manager @entity65 ( left ) will coach the @entity0 side @entity226 : @entity36 is suspended for @entity0 against @entity3 as they look to top @entity208			1

@entity23 will name a side without a ' @entity21 ' against @entity3 on monday
no @entity9 team has been without a ' @entity21 ' in the team for 18 years
the last ' @entity25 ' @entity0 side beat @entity63 2 - 0 on may 29 , 1996
their manager , @entity65 , is the only ' @entity21 ' on show for @entity0
a win or a draw will see @entity0 top @entity208 *ahead* of *opponents* @entity3
