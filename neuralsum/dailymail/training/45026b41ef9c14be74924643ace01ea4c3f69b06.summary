by @entity0 last updated at 10:44 pm on 27th october 2011 intimate letters to a pen friend from @entity3 have revealed new details of the four years she spent in prison wrongly accused of the murder of @entity8			1
@entity9 , 24 , received - and wrote - thousands of letters during her time in jail with many coming from male admirers who wanted to marry her and she only wrote back to people she knew in trusted			1
she was sensationally released earlier this month along with her former boyfriend @entity17 , 27 , after a year long appeal showed they had been convicted thanks to a botched police forensic investigation			1
behind bars : before her release @entity3 wrote and received thousands of letters in the letters @entity9 speaks of her fear at spending the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did not commit and tells her friend - known only as @entity33 - of how she spends her time in jail listening to music , studying and have a cell mate give her a manicure			1
she wrote : ' i often think " why am i here ? " , " why ca n't i be with my mum " , " why am i in jail ? i am 20 years old , i have never committed a crime			1
there is no sense to this			2
how can they say i need to stay in prison because i am a danger to the people around me ? when above all they do not know the truth ! " ' it is truly a torture and now i know the reason			2
i know the reason but i do n't agree with it			0
i am being tortured and i do not agree with it			0
as i say i am suffering so much in prison			0
i feel scared , lonely without hope , tired even though i am innocent			0
' famous : @entity3 breaks down in tears after hearing the verdict that overturns her conviction , and she maintained her innocence throughout the letters the letter was written in april 2008 , shortly after @entity68 's @entity67 overturned an application for bail and speaking of the ruling to keep her in jail she said : ' i do n't understand how some judges can sleep at night			1
when they know a big mistake has been made			0
ah ... mamma mia ... ' anyway i am studying so much , i even started reading @entity68 poetry ...			1
i pass the time reading books and singing ( i am still in isolation ) so when i get my fresh air time i get plenty of sun but i am still so very , very white			1
' in another letter @entity9 wrote of how she was not allowed to accept books with a hardback cover and expressed her regret that one she had been sent was not given to her adding : ' i 've asked for it to be kept - it would be a shame to ruin such a lovely book			2
i 'll read it when i am out			0
' not mentioned : @entity3 's letters never spoke about @entity8 , the @entity96 girl she was wrongly convicted of killing @entity9 never mentions @entity8 - who was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared - in her letters , instead she insists repeatedly she is innocent of the murder she has been accused and later convicted of			1
@entity9 also describes her daily routine in jail and in one undated letter wrote : ' i 'm happy that i am staying in @entity107 ( jail )			1
i do n't want to start all over again in a new place and i 've heard the jails in @entity111 can be quote tough			0
' i 'm doing fine in my new cell			2
i swapped so that i could be with a girl my age			2
we joke , cook and give each other manicures			2
we listen to lots of music because we are allowed a radio			2
' in another letter written in november 2009 - just days before she was convicted of murder and given 26 years @entity9 wrote of her hopes that she would be released and said : ' i suppose you are still playing basketball			1
i 'm terrible at basketball because i have small hands and i ca n't control the ball			0
' all of my family will be in court tomorrow			0
my dad , mum , stepmother and my aunt			0
my three sisters are arriving on december 2			0
i hope so much that i can finally go home with them , at last			0
i can see it in my '' third eye '' i 'm sitting on the plane between my mum and sisters			0
maybe i am thinking too much about it			0
' the letters are always signed off by @entity146 fan @entity9 the same way with a line from the @entity146 's hit @entity149 ' before she ends with the words : ' i know that i am not alone even when i am alone			2
' home : @entity3 has kept a low - profile since returning to @entity153 but was shown smiling during a walk holding chocolate and toothpaste earlier this month @entity9 has kept a low profile since returning to her native @entity153 earlier this month , while @entity17 has also remained in his home at @entity158 near @entity159 although in a recent interview he said the couple ' wrote and spoke ' to each other every day and he planned to visit her in the @entity163			1
prosecutors have said they intend to appeal the verdict although nothing will happen until early next year when the appeal judge publishes his report into the the sentencing which will be studied intently to see on what grounds they can act on			0
however there is no obligation for @entity9 to return to @entity68 as the @entity67 who would look at any eventual appeal will sit in @entity111 and examine the case to see if any mistakes were made in the application of the law and if they decide there were any than a new trial could be ordered			0
free : @entity3 's ex-boyfriend , @entity17 walking with his sister , father and father 's girlfriend since his release			1
he has also spoken to miss @entity3 and may visit technically they could request @entity9 's extradition but it is thought highly unlikely that the @entity163 would hand her over for trial			1
@entity8 , from @entity191 , @entity192 , was a @entity193 student who was in @entity107 as part of her degree course and had only been in @entity68 for two months before she was murdered four years ago next week			1
@entity197 drifter @entity8 was convicted of her murder and sexual assault in 2008 and given 30 years but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal .			1

notes reveal she spent her time in jail listening to music , studying and having manicures from cell mate
