by @entity0 published : 14:48 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 14:52 est , 3 december 2013 parents in a @entity3 suburb have teamed up with @entity4 after at least 10 area children have been diagnosed with brain tumors			1
@entity7 and @entity9 's son @entity8 died five years after being diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 19			2
after his death , they began hearing about other families whose children were also battling malignant and benign brain tumors			1
speaking out : @entity7 and @entity9 's son @entity8 ( pictured ) died after a five year battle with a brain tumor that he was diagnosed with when he was 19 years old scary trend : @entity8 is just one of at least 10 people who grew up in @entity22 , @entity23 and were diagnosed with brain tumors ' i just collected names , numbers and addresses and they kind of were in the same proximity , even though @entity22 ’s a small town , ' @entity25 told @entity31 @entity3			1
the @entity32 were joined at the @entity31 interview by two other parents of teens who were fighting the same disease - and who had all lived in the same area of @entity23			0
one of which was @entity40 , whose daughter @entity41 was diagnised with a fatal brain tumor at the age of 14			0
doctors told her that she would only live for three months , but she has since undergone 12 surgeries and is now 22 - years - old			0
voice of experience : @entity4 has made her career helping families fight against environmental causes of disease and now she is pushing for answers in the @entity22 case banding together : @entity54 ( left ) , @entity40 ( center ) and @entity25 ( right ) are just three of the concerned parents whose children have either been diagnosed with or died from a brain tumor ' i knew about three or four more people in addition to @entity8 ( @entity9 ) and @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , ' mr @entity40 said , mentioning one of @entity41 's friends who 's brain tumor is now in remission after extensive treatment			1
a number of the children in question attended @entity71 , the public school serving the area of 34,400 people			0
as much as the similar stories have given the parents a means of support through the difficult diagnoses , they are more concerned with stopping the problem and finding the source of the ' cancer cluster '			0
' i do n’t even know if ( county officials ) are aware of it , honestly , ' said mrs @entity25			0
fighter : doctors told @entity87 that she would only live for three months after being diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of 14 today : 12 surgeries later , @entity41 is paralyzed on her left side but has not given up hope after conferring , the families contacted legal advocate @entity95 , who became famous for building the case against one of @entity23 's biggest gas companies after finding them at fault for a similar cancer cluster			1
there are no firm leads on any potential causes for the high number of brain tumors in the area , but @entity4 says that further research into the case will be helped by a national disease tracking database			1
@entity4 has been advocating for some form of federal website that would allow people across the @entity115 to report when they are diagnosed with various cancers and brain tumors			1
such a database would help experts have a collective source recording how many cases of certain diseases are reported in certain areas			0
no more football : @entity41 's friend @entity62 was diagnosed with a similar brain tumor and although it is in remission , he has been barred from playing on the school football team she testified about its merits in the @entity132 in 2011 but the bill pushing for the creation of such a site has been stalled			2
' i think we need to get in the business of taking a look at a national reporting center , so we can begin to look at science , look at stats … help science help doctors , so doctors can help their patients , so we can have better health , ' she told @entity31 @entity3			0
cancer clusters which stem from environmental issues are spread across the country , including one recent case in the @entity152 suburb of @entity153			2
in that case , at least a dozen children were infected - two of whom died - as it was discovered that the school sports field was filled with toxic chemical waste .			2

families of teenagers from the same @entity23 high school are trying to find the cause of their children 's brain tumors
legal advocate @entity4 is now helping them on their case
no causes have been publicly identified
@entity22 , @entity23 is now thought to be one of *hundreds* of cancer clusters across the @entity115
