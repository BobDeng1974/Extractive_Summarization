wearing his sister ’s skirt to school certainly got @entity4 noticed			1
now it has also secured a nobler aim – and forced his school into a climbdown over its ban on shorts			1
@entity4 , 13 , made headlines with his outrageous method of protest at being prevented from wearing shorts in hot weather			1
skirting the issue : @entity4 , pictured last year , has finally made a breakthrough against his school 's uniform policy following his unusual protest he brought national scrutiny to the uniform policy at @entity22 , @entity23 , when he turned up for lessons in a knee - length skirt last year			1
he claimed it was unfair that girls were allowed to wear skirts while boys were banned from wearing shorts			1
forcing boys to wear long trousers during warm weather had a negative effect on their concentration , he argued			0
around 30 friends joined him at the school gates to beg headteacher @entity37 to reconsider			0
they displayed banners reading ‘ @entity39 ’ , ‘ shorts for the long - term ’ and ‘ @entity42 ’ , equality : @entity4 had argued it was unfair male pupils were made to wear trousers even in sweltering summer months yesterday @entity4 claimed victory after the school announced that boys would be allowed to wear shorts after half - term for the rest of the school year			1
the youngster , who hopes to become a politician , welcomed the decision but added : ‘ it ’s a shame that only a little has changed after such a long uniform review			0
it seems that the adults influenced the decision more than the students themselves			0
’ the 1,368 - pupil school , which was classed as ‘ good ’ in its latest @entity65 inspection in 2006 , imposed the shorts ban two years ago after a consultation with parents and teachers			2
its code stated that students must wear ‘ plain black tailored trousers or knee - length skirts without slits ’ – but did not specify gender			0
this meant that while shorts were prohibited , boys were free to wear skirts as long as they were ‘ free - moving , not tight against the legs ’			2
@entity4 won support across the country , with @entity83 presenter @entity82 donning a skirt in solidarity			2
the schoolboy was even named runner - up in @entity90 ’s human rights young person of the year competition in @entity92			0
yesterday his parents @entity94 and @entity95 said : ‘ we hope that @entity4 ’s campaign inspires other young people to take a stand for things they believe in			2
‘ in this case , he has won his campaign for shorts – if only for a trial period – but in the future there will no doubt be other more significant issues for him to engage with			0
