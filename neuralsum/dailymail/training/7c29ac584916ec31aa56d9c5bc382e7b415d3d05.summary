by @entity0 for @entity1 we might not be quite ready to send humans to @entity4 , but that has n’t stopped some bright minds coming up with ideas for what people might live in when they arrive			1
in a competition for @entity12 called the ' @entity13 ' , innovators were tasked with designing living space for future astronauts			1
the winning design is one that intends to give explorers two bedrooms , two bathrooms and other six - sided rooms in a ‘ honeycomb ’ shape			1
@entity25 - based designer has won a competition to design a home for future astronauts to live in on @entity4 with his ' @entity29 printed design for a contest run by @entity12 and @entity32 in may this year @entity12 's chief scientist dr @entity33 outlined the space agency 's plans for @entity4			1
in a series of talks across the @entity38 she said we 'll be there by the 2030s			0
but she explained there are key developments that must be made first these include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components this will ensure the first @entity4 - walkers survive a return trip to the red planet , she said			1
the competition was carried out by @entity12 in alongside 3d - printing company @entity32			1
it took place on @entity54 , a website where people can share their designs for 3d printers			2
contestants were tasked with designing their own abode using a 3d printer that future astronauts might one day live inside			1
the winning design was by @entity63 from @entity25			1
@entity12 asked entrants to design houses that could tackle @entity4 ’ extremely cold temperature , high radiation levels , lack of oxygen and frequent dust storms			1
‘ my solution is to use the tessellating hexagon due to its compactness and modular potential , ’ mr @entity63 wrote in his entry			0
mr @entity63 's design includes different rooms for people to use such as bedrooms and even a garden mr @entity63 says he chose the hexagon shape because it was less likely to break over time than squares the hexagonal shape also allowed a number of amenities to be fitted into the separate rooms most of the time , @entity4 is clear , dry , cold , and clear			1
clouds are very small , wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice			0
it never rains on @entity4 because of the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield , the the one that cover @entity95			1
temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20 ° @entity98 but at night , temperatures can drop to -90 ° @entity98 this dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks			0
the maximum wind speeds on @entity4 recorded by the @entity105 in the 1970 's were about 30 meters per second ( 60 mph ) with an average of 10 m / s ( 20 mph )			2
‘ i have extrapolated on the idea of a fully functional apartment on @entity4 with all the modern amenities fit inside 16ft ( 5 metre ) diameter hexagons			2
' i think that to present @entity4 life to people and actually make it appealing to the public , it needs to feel like home and reflect the lifestyle trends of @entity95 living			2
’ he says his design , without any appendages sticking out , would be more practical for long - term living			2
and a hexagonal shape would also be less likely to distort or rupture under pressure than other shapes , such as a square			0
to stay warm , meanwhile , a large subterranean container would hold water to be heated in an underground electric heater			0
this would keep the bottom of the house heated , while the creation of steam would allow for steam - powered generators for energy			2

this would keep the bottom of the house warm , while the creation of steam would allow for steam - powered generators in total the competition had 228 submissions , with first place winning a @entity149 printer			1
second place went to the @entity151 from user @entity152 , who favoured the triangular shape			0
their home was designed around sustainability and had a closed aquaponics system to grow food			0
the @entity163 meanwhile , from project and design engineer @entity162 , was a more complicated design that would have three greenhouses , a water tower to collect vapour from the atmosphere and even a runway			0

@entity183 is part of competition to design a base for astronauts on @entity4
the contest was run by @entity12 and 3d - printing company @entity32
it asked innovators to find *structures* that would allow humans to survive
the winning design *focused* on how to remain sustainable while coping with the *hostile* @entity4 *environment*
