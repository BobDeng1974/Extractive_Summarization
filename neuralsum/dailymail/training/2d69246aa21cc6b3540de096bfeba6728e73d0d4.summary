but i have swapped my rifle for a long lens now			2
i use the exact same techniques of a sniper - shape , shine and silhouette - to make sure i go unnoticed by the wildlife			0

‘ so everything has to be planned down to the very last detail			0
the deodorant you wear , the toothpaste you use , the smell of your clothes			0
believe it or not it all matters			0
