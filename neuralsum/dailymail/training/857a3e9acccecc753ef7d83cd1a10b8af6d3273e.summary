early this morning , the @entity12 @entity11 upheld the appeal of two last - minute stays of execution granted to @entity15 over the single drug @entity17 planned to use in his execution			1
less than one hour later , at 6.17am @entity21 , @entity15 's death sentence was carried out with an injection of pentobarbital at the state prison in @entity25 , @entity17			1
it was @entity17 's first execution in three years and the first using the single drug - a sedative that caused the accidental overdose of @entity31			2
through the years : @entity15 as seen in a series of booking photos from 2005 to 2012 @entity34 is starting to replace three - drug lethal injection cocktails that had previously been used because drug manufacturers will no longer provide them to @entity12 prisons			1
@entity15 rejected his last meal			2
he also made no statement before his execution and said nothing in the death chamber			1
as he was injected with the drug , he blinked , breathed heavily , swallowed hard and slipped away within minutes , the @entity45 reports			0

the @entity17 @entity60 wasted no time in executing him			0
of all the killings @entity15 admitted to , it was for the 1977 sniper shooting of @entity64 at a suburban @entity45 synagogue that he was executed			1
tools of hate : this grab from @entity69 shows the rifle and guitar case carried by the notorious serial killer mentally detached : mr @entity15 's lawyer says he was likely unaware he was on death row authorities provided no account of execution , except to say that he died at 6.17am cst			1
a federal judge had ruled tuesday afternoon that a lawsuit filed on behalf of mr @entity15 and 20 other @entity17 inmates on death row arguing the dangers of propofol must be resolved before anyone can be executed			1
lawyers for the serial killer have argued the drug can cause contamination and pain above and beyond thresholds allowed by the @entity90 - which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment			2
the judge on tuesday agreed , writing that the state ' has not provided any information about the certification , inspection history , infraction history , or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug			0
' a separate ruling from another judge tuesday called mr @entity15 's mental capacity into question , and said his mental illness should be reviewed before he is put to death			1
his mental state is such that he was n't even aware he was on death row			2
' he was happy , ' his attorney told the @entity111			0
' i ’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die			0
' mr @entity15 earlier this week confirmed to @entity69 he was responsible for the cold - blooded execution - style deaths of ' approximately ' 22 people			1
he was devoid of emotion as he attempted to justify his killings - which famously included an attempt on the life of @entity119 porn supremo @entity10 - who incredibly tried to stop his shooters execution			1
following his 1980 arrest , mr @entity15 told detectives that he selected the @entity125 synagogue from the @entity126 of the telephone directory because he wanted to ' find a @entity9 and kill him , ' according to reports			1

' death row : @entity15 is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on wednesday for the sniper killing of 42 - year - old @entity64 outside a suburban @entity45 synagogue in 1977 investigators believe his cross-country crime spree was fueled by a hatred of blacks and @entity9			1
mr @entity15 confessed collared in 1980 after the @entity136 killings			1
among his alleged crimes were two high - profile shootings — of civil rights leader @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170 , in 1980 , and the man he calls his ' old pal ' - porn mogul @entity10 , in @entity173 , @entity174 , in 1978			1
mr @entity15 told @entity69 he believed he was going to start a race war and that his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper 's nest from which he pick them off using a high - powered rifle			1
seemingly still in denial , mr @entity15 tried to blame his rough childhood on his three - year orgy of violence			1
offending magazine : these are the front covers from the 1975 edition of @entity119 that enraged @entity15 ' my momma did n't care about us , ' he said , as he complained he was n't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children			2
finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the @entity195 in the 1960s , mr @entity15 felt he found his calling after reading @entity199 's political manifesto ' @entity198 '			2
' i 've never felt that way about any other book that i read , ' he said , ' it was something weird about that book			0
' at 26 , he changed his name to @entity15 to honor @entity207 propaganda minister @entity206 and founding father @entity208			0
he even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer @entity209 by having the words ' @entity210 ' tattooed on his arm in reference to mr @entity209 's inspiration provided by @entity216 ' @entity215 '			0
the tattoo artist rebuffed the attempt , the tattoo never came			0
mr @entity15 explained that he hoped his early murders would set an example to other would - be soldiers in his one - man war on minorities			1
hatred : the neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple in @entity132 , @entity133 in 1977 , two black joggers in @entity136 in 1980 and bombing a synagogue in @entity142 , @entity143 in 1977 ' i figured once i started doing it and showed them how , other white supremacists would do the same thing			2
' mr @entity15 then shockingly claimed minorities he once targeted now have a kinship with him			2
' when you commit a crime against a certain group of people , a bonding takes place			0
it seems like you belong to them , ' he said			0
in addition to the murder of mr @entity64 outside a bar mitzvah , mr @entity15 was convicted of killing @entity248 and @entity249 in @entity132 , @entity133 , because they were an interracial couple			1
he also confessed to shooting dead college student @entity252 , after she told him in passing that she dated a @entity254 man			0
his most shocking murder was that of 13 - year - old @entity256 and his cousin 14 - year - old @entity257 in @entity259 - two @entity258 jogging with white female friends			0
@entity261 , who prosecuted that @entity259 case said , ' he 's just a creep			0
there 's no other way to describe him			0
and what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible			0
' victim : @entity10 says he does n't to see the man who shot him put to death @entity119 chief @entity10 was standing trial on an obscenity charge in @entity174 in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper 's bullet			1
no one was arrested at the time , but the shooting has since been linked to mr @entity15			2
@entity279 , @entity174 , district attorney @entity280 said he is convinced @entity15 shot @entity10 because @entity15 provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location , the type of weapon used , even the maker of the gun			1
the details were divulged while the killer served time in the 1990s in a @entity174 prison			0
mr @entity15 said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple			1
' i saw that interracial couple he had , photographed there , having sex , ' he told @entity69 , referring to the december 1975 issue of @entity119 ' it just made me sick			2
i think whites marry with whites , blacks with blacks , @entity303 with @entity303			0
i threw the magazine down and thought , i 'm gon na kill that guy			0
' however , mr @entity280 said he opted against filing charges because @entity15 had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it did n't make sense to bring him back to @entity174 to face trial for shooting mr @entity10			1
incredibly , the @entity119 founder has become an unlikely supporter of @entity15 's - in so much as he does n't want him to face the death penalty			1
mr @entity10 would rather his shooter rot away in a prison cell			2
' the government has no business at all being in the business of killing people , ' said @entity10			2
' ( it 's ) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection			0
' mr @entity10 's sadistic hopes have been kept alive for the time being .			0

@entity15 admitted to killing 22 people across multiple states between 1977 and 1980
he was executed less than an hour after the @entity12 @entity11 put an end to last - minute legal maneuvering
@entity15 declined his last meal , made no statement and said nothing in the death chamber
he was on @entity17 death row for the 1977 killing of a @entity9 man outside a @entity45 synagogue
