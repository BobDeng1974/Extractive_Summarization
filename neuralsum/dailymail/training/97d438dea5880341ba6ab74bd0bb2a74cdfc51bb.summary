by @entity0 federal mp @entity1 has received a death threat after posting a controversial @entity4 comment regarding the budget on thursday			1
the @entity7 member for the @entity9 electorate of @entity10 suggested that people who were unhappy with the tough budget measures , should try living in @entity14 before they complained			2
' @entity16 should do tour of @entity14 & live like locals to put these 1st world complaints re budget in perspective , ' mr @entity1 ’s tweet read on thursday			1
federal lnp member @entity1 reported a death threat to the federal police on monday , which he received after posting a controversial tweet telling @entity26 complainers to ' tour @entity14 ' on thursday the generalised comment which verged on racism , also included a picture of impoverished @entity32 children in a slum background for added effect			1
furious with the distasteful comment , dozens of @entity4 users fired back with their own tweets labeling the comment as shameful			1
greens member @entity39 was one of the many repliers , writing ' or , @ @entity42 , why do n't you live 6 mths in @entity16 on no income ( as u want under 30s to ) & tell us how you get on '			2
others rebuked mr @entity1 by criticising the budget ’s $ 7.8 billion worth of cuts to foreign aid over five years , suggesting a reversal to alleviate the poverty problems the mp was pointing out			1
unaffected by the backlash , the @entity9 mp defended his tweet with a simple : ' sometimes truth hurts ’ while accusing ' the lefty twitter warriors ' of going into meltdown			1
mr @entity1 also personally addressed a number of critics on the site , telling one that budget whingers ' complaints were minuscule on a global scale			1
' try getting any serious form of welfare in @entity68 or other @entity32 nations , ' he replied to another			0
but things took a far more sinister turn when mr @entity1 revealed via twitter that he had received a death threat regarding his original post			1
the anonymous email , which mr @entity1 said he took to federal police on friday , warned that mps in @entity32 countries are assassinated and was accompanied by a photo of a man whose head has been blown off			2
' just remember arsewipe , those @entity32 countries also have a high number of @entity53 ( sic ) that are assassinated			0
. just remember that ! ' the email said			0
' you have just become a @entity89 ! ' in an interview with the aap , mr @entity1 revealed he did n't expect that his tweet would lead to such a serious and dangerous reaction			2
' it 's probably the most confronting email i 've ever received , ' he said			0
' you receive nasty emails ( as an mp ) ... i have a thick enough skin for that but i do n't have a thick enough skin to stop a bullet from going through my head			0
' mr @entity1 also claimed anger about the budget was unwarranted , and debate about it needed to be brought down to a ' sensible level '			0
' i think everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down about it , ' he said			0
within his tweet informing followers that he 'd received the threat , mr @entity1 also wrote that the @entity114 , @entity115 , was ' fanning this violence '			1
a spokeswoman for mr @entity115 described the remark as a ' disgusting new low ' for the @entity120			0
' if the prime minister has any sense , he 'd instruct @entity1 to apologise for this offensive and irresponsible statement , ' she said			0
' there is a right way and a wrong way to protest this unfair budget - making threats like this is never acceptable			0
