by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 17:56 est , 28 november 2013 montanans looking to save on their @entity3 meal this year need look no further than the side of the freeway			0
that 's because the state passed a law on tuesday making it legal for residents to eat roadkill			1
predators , birds and sheep are the only animals not allowed to be salvaged , so turkey 's not an option			2
but certainly you could make due with one of the 4,754 whitetail deer killed a year in the state ? all you have to do is fill out a permit within 24 hours of salvaging the roadkill			1
what 's for dinner ? on tuesday , it became legal in @entity27 to salvage and consume certain kinds of roadkill now ok to eat : 4,754 @entity32 , 977 @entity31 @entity30 still off - limits : 39 black bears5 @entity36 lions15 @entity35 sheep ' any peace officer in the state of @entity27 can issue a vehicle - killed wildlife salvaged permit			1
the @entity45 is capable of actually printing the permits in their vehicles , we can issue the permits on the side of the road , ' @entity43 sergeant @entity42 told @entity51			2
if a police officer is n't present , @entity27 can alternately fill out a form online			1
there are some rules that govern how the animals can be used , however			2
road kill can only be used for one 's own consumption and must not be donated , used as bait or pet food			2
you also must clear the road fully of all parts of the animal			0
any animal still alive when found on the side of the road can only be killed if it 's in season and the person has a valid hunting license			0
anyone found taking roadkill without filling out the proper paperwork can be ticketed for illegal possession			1
authorities warn citizens to be careful what they choose to eat off the side of the road			0
no turkey : some kinds of roadkill are still illegal to eat including predators , birds of prey and sheep ' we assume no liability whatsoever for the quality of the meat , ' @entity85 , assistant chief of law enforcement for the state @entity88 , and @entity90 , told @entity95			1
' the conditions of the permit say you take full responsibility for the quality of the meat you salvage			0
' but many believe this new regulation will help feed many hungry @entity27			1
' we have people that are hungry here in this country			0
this is a good way to supplement your food			0
some of that meat 's good			0
yeah , some of it will be bad if it 's been hit hard ; but overall i think it 's a wonderful program , ' @entity112 resident @entity111 said			0
some 17 other states have codes regulating roadkill possession and consumption .			1
