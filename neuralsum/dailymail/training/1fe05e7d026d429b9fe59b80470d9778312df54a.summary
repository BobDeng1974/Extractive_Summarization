@entity0 have an interest in @entity3 midfielder @entity2 , as do all of the @entity6 's top clubs , but they have yet to set wheels in motion for any bid			1
any such action would likely depend on @entity11 and what comes of his planned talks with @entity15 's hierarchy			2
it is understood he and his representative @entity17 have made contact with the club owners to dampen the initial furore that surrounded his claims of feeling unloved			0
@entity37 have made no secret of their interest should @entity11 be made available while reports in @entity41 have linked @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
city hope to maintain control of the situation while the sale of such a talent would sorely test any buying club 's @entity49 guidelines			2
should the worst happen and @entity11 goes then @entity2 would come into their thinking but he would not be their only option			1
suffice to say @entity56 have no plans to sell @entity2			1
after last season 's step forward , it would be a huge fall backwards to sell the 20 - year - old			2
the statement it sends out would undermine what the club is striving to achieve			0
they know they could command £ 50million plus but @entity2 is pivotal to the plans of @entity70			1
if those plans come to fruition that should convince @entity2 his immediate future is at @entity74			1
@entity75 could see @entity76 move collapse due to heart problem @entity76 beat @entity0 to the signing of @entity75 , who was hailed as @entity81 's latest wunderkind			1
however , during the 19 - year - old 's medical in may , it was discovered that the @entity85 teenager had a heart defect and he was sent for surgery at a @entity89 clinic			1
the latest prognosis is that he must avoid all football for another six months to allow his body time to repair and re-adjust			0
moving off ? @entity75 's move to @entity76 could be cancelled after a heart problem was discovered the clubs have now decided to suspend the transfer and will monitor his recuperation with @entity76 poised to make a statement in the coming weeks			1
@entity75 , who hails from the same city as @entity101 , @entity102 , only made his full debut last year and had agreed a five year contract with the clubs agreeing a £ 6m transfer fee			1
@entity107 keen on @entity109 's @entity108 @entity107 admire @entity110 at @entity109 but are unlikely to make a bid at this stage			2
the 18 - year - old has been watched closely by @entity114 and @entity115 this season while @entity117 have an interest too			0
@entity107 are continuing talks with @entity120 over the permanent sale of @entity122 for £ 4.5m , rising to £ 7m , while @entity123 are trying to find money to pay for @entity125			0
keeping an eye on thigns : @entity110 of @entity109 is attracting interest from @entity107 @entity107 plan to sign @entity129 from @entity130 , who would then be loaned back			0
@entity133 's @entity132 , @entity135 's @entity134 and @entity137 's @entity136 are the other players in their sights at this stage			2
@entity142 's price and wages are an obstacle that @entity115 and @entity107 are wrestling with and if the figures do n't change he may well stay at @entity137			2
@entity115 are also among clubs to have enquired about 23 - year - old @entity147 at @entity148 but they are unlikely to pursue a deal for former @entity43 striker @entity150 , who it is understood has been offered to them			0
@entity152 have taken former @entity154 winger @entity153 on trial			0
the 19 - year - old endured a difficult loan spell at @entity158 last season but @entity160 is willing to give him a chance as he looks to inject some pace into his squad			0
@entity164 - born @entity153 came through @entity135 's youth academy and was picked up by @entity154 manager @entity166 as one to be developed for the future but the changes at @entity169 soon put paid to that			0
premier chance : @entity172 are keen on @entity173 's @entity153 @entity25 sign @entity29 winner @entity22 @entity25 have completed the signing of @entity177 man @entity22			1
although @entity22 , 20 , can also play as a defensive midfielder , the deal has increased speculation that @entity25 may be willing to allow @entity181 to leave			1
@entity42 and @entity182 have both been linked with @entity183 but the @entity185 side are concentrating on @entity186 at @entity117			0
on the move : @entity22 has signed for @entity25 following helping @entity177 win the @entity29 @entity188 the grinner after @entity25 move @entity42 have watched @entity183 for some time but had reservations about his lack of pace with injuries having taken their toll			1
he remains outstanding in the box but may struggle if in a high line of defence			0
new manager @entity201 remains keen on @entity114 's @entity202 and @entity148 midfielder @entity203 but there are talks planned between staff and some @entity208 agents at a @entity210 hotel which may clarify other targets			2
@entity42 are not pursuing @entity212 at @entity213 , though			0
@entity214 is the latest @entity6 player to be courted by clubs in @entity216			1
fresh from his @entity29 exploits with @entity220 , the former @entity218 striker is a free agent and weighing up offers from home and abroad			2
@entity216 clubs are willing to pay lucrative contracts but it 's not always easy convincing players to go			1
@entity227 , coached by @entity228 last week signed @entity229 to join former @entity230 forward @entity231			0
heading east ? @entity214 could be tempted by a move to @entity216 after leaving @entity218 they have agreed to match his wages at @entity235 plus bonuses which are understood to be around £ 4m a year			1
@entity237 and @entity238 made an approach for @entity214 in february and remain keen on the 32 - year - old			1
hammer time for @entity241 @entity230 have been offered the chance to sign @entity243 midfielder @entity241			0
the 22 - year - old @entity245 playmaker was one of several of his countrymen to impress at the @entity29 and @entity243 , who are in the throes of rebuilding , are ready to sell to re-inforce their squad in other areas			2
@entity230 would prefer a loan but have other options			0
they are pursuing left - backs , another wide player and a centre - back			0
hammer time ? @entity245 playmaker @entity241 could be on his way to @entity230 @entity259 on @entity43 's radar @entity43 have expressed an interest in @entity148 defender @entity262			0
as reported in @entity264 , the 27 - year - old is an option for @entity0 and @entity42 also			2
however , @entity43 are keeping a keener eye on talks between @entity268 and @entity44 this week			0
if there is any indication that he could leave , @entity269 will try and sign the @entity41 defender who he rates as one of the best in the world			0
blue day : @entity43 have shown an interest in @entity148 's @entity262 the 21 - year - old , a favourite of @entity279 coach @entity278 , wants re-assurances about his role in the team with @entity284 favouring he more experienced @entity285 and @entity286 for most of last season			0
@entity288 close to @entity290 move @entity290 expect to wrap up the finer details of @entity288 's transfer from @entity137 today			1
the 28 - year - old @entity288 was due to fly to @entity293 today before getting a connection to @entity295 , in @entity296 , northern @entity297 , where @entity290 hold their pre-season training camps			1
@entity297 job : @entity288 moves closer to a transfer to @entity290 the deal will be a loan with a guaranteed £ 8million to follow at the end of the season			1
@entity137 's @entity305 is close to finalising his move to @entity307 but they expect to finalise @entity309 's transfer from @entity310			1
@entity290 have maintained interest in @entity115 's @entity312 and may try to offer @entity313 as part of negotiations having baulked at the initial £ 20m valuation of @entity312 .			1
