a boy ’s brain tumour ‘ the size of a clementine ’ was missed by doctors - and only discovered after his mother threatened to get out her chequebook and pay for a scan			1
@entity8 , aged five , had suffered tell - tale signs including prolonged bouts of vomiting over nine months , once being sick every day for 18 days			1
he also had problems with his balance and the pupils of his eyes were dilated			2
@entity15 , 42 , threatened to pay for a private brain scan after @entity18 doctors were hesitant to give one to her son			1
@entity8 , five , pictured centre with his mother and his two brothers @entity23 and @entity24 , eventually had a scan - showing a tumour which could have been there since birth but @entity8 ’s illness was initially dismissed as a vomiting syndrome and he was discharged from hospital at least four times			1
doctors were reluctant to send him for a scan because of the risk posed by radiation			1
@entity8 ’s mother @entity15 , 42 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , said the scan was eventually ordered only after she ‘ threw her toys out of the pram ’			1
she recalled : ‘ i said , ‘ i want a brain scan and i will pay for it			1
it does n’t matter how much it costs			2
i will get my chequebook out now and i will pay for a scan			1
if it comes back clear , you keep the cheque			2
if it comes back with something on it then you are paying for it			2
‘ i said ‘ where can i go privately for a scan ? ’ the doctor said ‘ you do not need to do that ’ , and i said ‘ i do because i keep saying there is something wrong with his head and nobody believes me '			2
' her son ’s case comes after statistics were released by the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) showing that the number of young people dying from brain tumours in the @entity69 is the highest in @entity70			2
the 12 - 13 week average time it takes to diagnose cases in the @entity69 is 50 per cent slower than some other @entity70 countries , the @entity65 adds			0
last year , about 500 people aged 2 - 24 were diagnosed with brain tumours and 125 died			0
@entity8 eventually received a scan , paid for by the @entity18 , at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity37			1
the scan was delayed for two days until the monday as the procedure was not carried out on weekends @entity8 eventually received a scan at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity37 , without charge and on the @entity18			1
the scan was delayed for two days until the monday , as the procedure was not carried out at weekends			2
mrs @entity15 said : ‘ i carried @entity8 in on monday morning			1
he could n’t even walk at that point			0
he could not stand up any more			0
i was holding him in my arms as he was being sick			0
he was out with the fairies			0
‘ a tumour the size of a clementine was found , which the doctors said may have been growing since birth			1
’ @entity8 was transferred to @entity94 ’s @entity93 where he underwent surgery two days later			1
although critical of @entity8 ’s care before the scan , mrs @entity15 said that from the moment the tumour was discovered in 2010 , she ‘ could not praise highly enough ’ the swift treatment given to @entity8 which included rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
' when we spoke to other parents , they were all saying they had to fight to get their children referred to hospital			0
yet the quicker the diagnosis of brain cancer , the greater the chances of survival ’ @entity15 when the cancer returned in @entity8 ’s spine in may 2013 , the family faced an agonising decision between localised radiotherapy or wider treatment on his spine and brain which could attack any undetected cancers but also carried a risk of brain damage			1
they took the risk - and it paid off			0
now aged nine and nicknamed ‘ @entity125 ’ because of his positive attitude , @entity8 has scans every three months to check the cancer has not returned			1
mrs @entity15 is calling on @entity129 to change their attitudes on admitting children for brain scans			0
she said : ‘ we had been going in and out of the @entity137 ’s office for two weeks			0
we kept being told that he could be looked after in the community and that they could see nothing wrong with him , it was just a virus			0
' i was saying : ‘ we have had [ this sickness ] a lot throughout the year ’			0
i insisted on [ @entity8 ] being admitted			1
’ mrs @entity15 believes many gps are ‘ too reluctant ’ to refer children to hospital - potentially delaying diagnosis in cancer cases which can affect chances of survival			2
she said : ‘ it was not just us			0
when we spoke to other parents , they were all saying they had to fight to get their children referred to hospital			0
yet the quicker the diagnosis of brain cancer , the greater the chances of survival			0
’ a charity , the @entity162 ’s @entity161 , has been set up by her and her husband , to raise awareness and fund child brain tumour research			2
and mrs @entity15 is also urging gps ’ surgeries to carry cards provided by the @entity170 campaign , which detail the symptoms of brain tumours			0
concern about @entity8 ’s case was echoed by @entity175 , chief executive of @entity176			1
she said : ‘ this is yet another example of a family facing immense stress as a result of the lack of awareness about brain tumours			0
people tell us far too often : ‘ i had to fight to get the scan we needed to diagnose what we suspected all along ’			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity188 , which runs both the @entity189 and the @entity191 hospitals , said : ‘ scans are undertaken when deemed clinically appropriate by the clinicians caring for the patient at the time			0
' clinicians always seek to avoid unnecessary exposure to x-rays in children			0

@entity8 , five , from @entity36 , had bouts of vomiting for nine months
doctors were reluctant to order a scan *due* to the risks posed by radiation
the scan was only arranged once his mother @entity209 threatened to go private
it showed a tumour which doctors say could have been there since birth
