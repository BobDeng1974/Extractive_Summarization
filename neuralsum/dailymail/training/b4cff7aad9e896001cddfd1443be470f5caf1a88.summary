@entity0 : @entity1 made the comments during a debate on @entity4 with some of his followers @entity1 risked provoking fury today by claiming foetuses with @entity9 's syndrome should be aborted - and parents should ' try again '			1
the controversial comments from the scientist , who is a vocal atheist , came during a debate on @entity4 with some of his 1million followers			1
a discussion began when professor @entity1 posted a link to an article in liberal @entity21 magazine @entity20 entitled ' the @entity22 prefers medieval barbarism to modern abortion '			1
professor @entity1 , 73 , said : ' @entity25 is a civilised country except in this one area			1
you 'd think the @entity22 would have lost all influence			2
' in response , @entity31 fitter @entity30 asked him : ' 994 human beings with @entity9 's syndrome deliberately killed before birth in @entity37 and @entity38 in 2012			1
is that civilised ? ' professor @entity1 said : ' yes , it is very civilised			2
these are foetuses , diagnosed before they have human feelings			0
' he later added : ' learn to think in non-essentialist ways			0
the question is not " is it ' human ' ? " but " can it suffer ? " ' then , he was told by @entity48 - based writer ' @entity46 ' : ' i honestly do n't know what i would do if i were pregnant with a kid with @entity9 's syndrome			1
' professor @entity1 replied : ' abort it and try again			2
it would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice			1
' but campaigners and charity workers contested professor @entity1 's statements , saying that the disability does not stop people having ' full and rewarding lives '			1
' at the @entity75 , we do not believe @entity9 ’s syndrome in itself should be a reason for termination , however , we realise that families must make their own choice			1
' the @entity75 strives to ensure that all prospective parents are given accurate and up to date information about the condition and what life might be like today for someone with @entity9 ’s syndrome			1
' and the pro-life campaign in @entity25 said the comments were ' chilling ' and ' deeply insulting '			2
a spokesman told @entity76 : ' these shocking comments by professor @entity1 are a chilling reminder of how easy it is for society to fall into the trap of deeming some human beings " imperfect " and unworthy of life			1
' to suggest that unborn babies diagnosed with @entity104 should be discarded through abortion is deeply insulting to children with this special need and their families			2
objection : people used tweeted their disgust at @entity1 's comments ' cruel ' : @entity25 human rights activist @entity113 condemned the comments as wilful controversy ' no less human ' : @entity116 , the head of the @entity117 think tank , also criticised @entity1 ' all human beings are entitled to live their lives to the fullest of their capabilities			1
in a compassionate society , we must work together to put in place the supports and assistance that will make this possible for everyone			0
' professor @entity1 's comments come after he said last week that having a faith helped foster terrorism			1
he suggested those who believe in @entity133 enable suicide bombers to murder thousands and make the ‘ world safe ’ for extremists			2
and last month he referred to ‘ mild date rape ’ and ‘ mild paedophilia ’ in comments on @entity4			1
campaigners for women and child abuse victims condemned those posts as ‘ offensive and damaging ’			0
he became embroiled in the row when he made a point about logical thinking			0
adored : @entity149 , has @entity104			0
her family say her coming into the world has been hard , but immensely rewarding the father of a one - year - old girl with @entity104 has told @entity1 aborting his child , as he advocates , would have been ‘ the greatest mistake of my life ’			1
@entity157 , from @entity158 , @entity159 , found out that his daughter , @entity160 , had the condition shortly after she was born			0
when he saw the academic ’s comments he tweeted back his point of view			2
speaking to @entity76 , mr @entity157 said that caring for @entity160 has ‘ made life harder ’ but that that it is impossible to measure the joy of being her father			0
he said : ‘ my wife and i found out our baby had @entity104 just after she was born , i 'll be the first to admit that i was heartbroken by the news			0
‘ i did n't know anything about @entity104 and really struggled to come to terms with all the dreams that i had for her that likely would n't come true			0
but as i got to know her , those dreams became less important			0
‘ she has completely changed the dynamic of our family			0
she has three older siblings , and they completely adore her			0
she is a complete joy to have in our home			0
‘ the dreams i have for her now are different than when she was born but i still have dreams			0
there are tough times , she has health problems related to @entity104 that will make life harder for all of us , but i would n't trade any of that if it meant not getting to know her			0
family : @entity160 , pictured with her father @entity157 and her three siblings hiking in @entity202 national park , @entity159 ‘ i do n't think it is " civilized " to abort a foetus that has @entity104 to avoid difficulties in the future , because you will also lose any joy that you would have had from having a wonderful child of @entity133 as part of your family			2
‘ is it easy ? nope			0
is it worth every trouble ? yes it is			0
’ @entity9 's syndrome is a genetic disorder that delays a person 's growth and causes intellectual disability			1
the condition was first detailed by @entity37 physician @entity9 in 1862			2
he later characterised it as a mental disability in a widely published report in 1866			0
most babies with @entity9 's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone , eyes that slant upwards , a low birth weight , a small nose and mouth and short fingers			1
they also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children			0
some children with @entity9 's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders , digestive problems , hearing and visual impairments , thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders			1
it is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the @entity251			0
it is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby 's cells			2
currently , no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but @entity9 's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers			1
for example , if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having @entity9 's syndrome , but if a 45 - year - old woman has a baby , there is a one in 30 chance of it having @entity9 's syndrome			1
