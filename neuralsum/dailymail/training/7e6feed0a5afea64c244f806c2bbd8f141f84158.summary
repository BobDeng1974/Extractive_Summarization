a chief constable has sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in @entity5			1
@entity6 , chief constable of @entity7 , called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems themselves rather than calling 999			1
she also said officers should not have to spend hours dealing with those threatening suicide simply because there is no separate emergency service for people suffering a mental health crisis			1
and she blasted shops and petrol stations for lax security that allows thieves to get away			1
appeal : chief constable @entity6 sparked a furious debate by saying police should not have to deal with every missing person report or tackle drunk and violent patients in @entity5 in an interview with @entity29 , mrs @entity6 said the burden placed on police by other organisations prevents them fighting growing crimes such as online fraud and child abuse			1
as forces struggle to cope with ongoing budget cuts , she called on the public to say what they expect of slimmed - down forces			2
‘ it ’s inevitable that the cuts will have operational consequences , ’ she said			0
the police have had a 20 per cent budget reduction since the last election in may 2010 , leading to the loss of 15,000 frontline officers and the closure of stations			2
but mrs @entity6 – a former @entity51 assistant commissioner who was in charge of security for prince @entity54 and @entity56 ’s wedding – said that as the cuts bite , some types of crime are on the rise			1
she said public - sector bodies and private firms must stop relying so much on the police			0
‘ we are going to be smaller , and there are some areas where we need to grow , such as our response to dealing with paedophiles and online fraud , ’ she said			0
‘ we are going to have to make choices in other areas			0
and it does mean we need other sectors to be held accountable for their core responsibilities			0
’ there had been a ‘ huge increase ’ in missing person reports , she said			0
in @entity7 they rose from 1,158 to 1,648 in the past year			1
some involved vulnerable children or elderly people with dementia , and a few would end up as murder inquiries			0
she called on hospitals and care homes to tackle problems like drunks themselves rather than calling 999 mrs @entity6 said : ‘ hospitals , care homes and other agencies report people missing and there are questions about whether they should do more themselves before they call the police			1
she said hospitals were the most frequent callers to @entity99 , followed by the ambulance service , usually reporting ‘ violent people , drunk people or missing people ’			2
but she said all these could be handled by in - house security			2
the @entity104 , the new professional body for the service , is looking nationally at the demands placed on police by other public - sector bodies			0
its research is expected to show that some officers are spending up to eight hours with people suffering mental health problems while doctors assess them , and three - quarters of those taken to ‘ places of safety ’ are driven by police rather than paramedics			1
mrs @entity6 , who spent @entity120 on the front line with her officers , said that a fifth of calls that night were either people threatening to kill themselves or from worried relatives			1
she said : ‘ the ambulance service is established to deal with physical health issues but there is no one agency that can respond to people with mental health issues			0
’ mrs @entity6 is also against police locking up drunks , because it takes officers off the street to keep watch over them			1
she said : ‘ i think there should be some funding from the licensing community , which makes huge profits from people who drink alcohol			0
’ she criticised shops for not investing enough in security to ‘ design out crime ’			2
and she thinks motorists should have to pay for petrol before filling up , so police do not have to chase those who drive off			0
@entity7 @entity99 have faced criticism for some of their spending , however			2
they spent £ 14 million over six years developing an it system for criminal intelligence – then scrapped it .			0
