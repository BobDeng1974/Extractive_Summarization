from a dainty @entity2 teahouse perched in a grove of cherry trees to an elegant modernist cabin in @entity6 , today 's treehouses are a world away from the father - fabricated efforts of childhood			1
no surprise then , that the new breed of treehouse has proven even more popular with adults than with children as @entity16 revealed when it unveiled the world 's best treehouses			2
so cool are the new breed of treehouse , they 've even merited their own design book : @entity22			2
@entity23 by @entity24 ( £ 44.99 , @entity25 )			0
included in both is the @entity26 , owned by @entity28 guitarist @entity27			0
after being exhibited at the @entity29 , the red wood and steel latticed sphere was installed at @entity27 's @entity34 home , where he apparently uses it to sit back , relax and write music			2
spectacular : the steel and cedar wood @entity26 now belongs to @entity28 guitarist @entity27 who uses it as a song - writing retreat at his @entity34 home home : the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , boasts two bedrooms , a spectacular lakeside setting and even has a separate tree office ( pictured left ) more traditional is the red cedar @entity51 at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , which was made by @entity56 specialists , @entity57 and installed atop a centuries old oak tree			1
another , the @entity44 in the town of @entity45 in @entity46 , sits at the edge of a spectacular lake and boasts two floors and a separate children 's retreat			1
designed by @entity66 na @entity67 , the two - bedroom home was constructed from local timber and built around an @entity70 eucalyptus tree			2
elsewhere , there 's the @entity72 near @entity73 in @entity74 , which boasts not one but seven extraordinary treehouses			1
the best known is the @entity76 , designed by architects @entity78 & @entity79 , and complete with a roof terrace and an interior packed with furniture by @entity84 architect @entity83			0
another super specimen is @entity86 , where the scarlet tiled exterior conceals slick @entity89 design within			0
there 's even a ufo - inspired design created by architect @entity92 which bears a close resemblance to a flying saucer and looks completely unearthly in its pretty forest surroundings			1
now you see it ... the spectacular @entity100 was designed by @entity89 architects @entity78 & @entity79 while the stylish interior was kitted out with furniture by @entity83 standout : despite being just 40 miles short of the @entity105 , the @entity104 designed ' @entity86 ' room at the @entity72 proves style is not in short supply hideaway : the @entity110 and @entity111 designed @entity112 ( left ) has a double bedroom while the spooky - looking @entity114 is deceptively spacious and sleeps four perhaps the most unearthly of all though is the stunning @entity116 at the @entity117 in the @entity2 city of @entity119			1
perched atop a cypress base in a gorgeous grove of pink - petalled cherry trees , the @entity121 - designed teahouse looks as if it sprang direct from the imagination of @entity127 and even has a fairytale - style crooked chimney			1
also in @entity2 is the amazing @entity129 , which serves up classic @entity131 fare from its perch at the top of a gnarled old tree overlooking @entity135			1
equally extraordinary but with a distinctly tropical feel is the @entity137 in the @entity138 which is set in a @entity140 tree on the island of @entity142 just off the coast of @entity144			0
designed by treehouses of @entity148 's @entity147 , the ' shack ' shouts @entity150 cool , despite its precarious perch and views of the jade green @entity154			0
but you do n't have to travel to @entity156 , @entity144 or @entity2 to get your design fix			1
much closer to home is the eco-friendly modernist effort in the town of @entity161 in @entity6 's @entity162			2
designed by @entity166 architects @entity164 , it has two cabins , a technology room , a pantry and a bath			0
