by @entity0 published : 18:12 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 18:12 est , 4 may 2013 liberty director @entity1 says free speech is a basic right a key adviser to @entity5 is this week poised to electrify the debate on press regulation – with a sweeping onslaught against the proposed @entity9 agreed by the three main political parties			1
@entity1 , director of the civil rights group @entity11 , will say the measures it contains would give too much power to politicians – and that it poses grave threats to the freedom of speech			1
her intervention will be seen as politically explosive – and as an attack on the celebrity - led campaign group , hacked off , which virtually dictated the charter ’s terms			1
she is said to share mounting concerns that hacked @entity24 has become too influential and that it is effectively demanding a right of veto on any @entity28 plan			1
the impact of ms @entity1 ’s comments will be intensified by her dual role			1
she leads the country ’s main civil rights pressure group – but was also was one of six ‘ assessors ’ who guided the @entity37 , and helped to produce its report			1
she has said nothing about how the report should be implemented since it was published in november			1
but in an interview with this newspaper , she said one of its proposals – for compulsory , government - imposed regulation for newspapers which refused to join a ‘ voluntary ’ regulator – would be unlawful under the @entity49			1
on friday the government agreed to extend the period before the @entity52 makes a final decision on the planned charter until the middle of next month			1
most of @entity58 ’s national and regional newspapers , including @entity59 , have drawn up their own rival version , which would eliminate political control			1
last night , speaking to this newspaper , ms @entity1 also attacked the way some official bodies have ‘ taken @entity5 in vain ’ by advocating repressive , authoritarian changes to the law in order to restrict information in ways the report never envisaged			1
chief among them is the policy to refuse to name people charged with criminal offences – a policy now being followed by about a third of @entity58 ’s police forces			2
last week @entity80 cited @entity5 in order to justify refusing to name retired officer @entity82 , who has been charged with stealing £ 113,000 from the force			2
ms @entity1 also condemned the rapidly spreading police policy of refusing to name people who have been arrested , though not yet charged – even though this measure was included in the @entity5 report			2
@entity5 carried out his inquiry into press standards last year she said : ‘ it ’s too easy to take @entity5 ’s name in vain but what is the real motive for this new call for legislation ? do the police want to avoid making difficult decisions , or to seek a complete lock - down on information on how their powers of arrest are exercised ? it is unnecessary and deeply worrying for traditions of open justice			1
’ it was wrong , she went on , for the police to disseminate untested information to the press about suspects in criminal cases and those under arrest			2
but she added : ‘ so is any blanket refusal to confirm the names of those detained or charged			2
’ however , it is her views on the shape of future press regulation which will have the biggest impact			2
the scope and constitution of a press regulator was @entity5 ’s central concern , and her intervention will mark the first public statement by those involved in the inquiry as to what should happen now			2
it is understood she is considering either a speech or a high - profile television interview in which to make her full criticisms public			1
the current ‘ official ’ version of the charter , which will govern how the new regulator is run , emerged from an all - night meeting in march between a four - man delegation from @entity24 , @entity141 ’s @entity140 , the @entity142 ’ @entity143 and @entity144 , the @entity145 cabinet office minister			2
if approved by the @entity52 , it could only by changed by a two - thirds majority of both houses of parliament – something which , in practice , would be almost impossible to achieve			2
ms @entity1 is said to regard this clause as anathema – because it would give the current generation of politicians who serve on the @entity52 an effective stranglehold on the shape of press regulation and freedom of speech – far into the future			1
under the newspapers ’ rival plan – which ms @entity1 and her @entity11 colleagues are said to be ‘ seriously considering ’ – the charter could be changed if the new regulator ’s board and the newspaper publishers unanimously agreed to do so			1
in her interview in november , she said that journalism ‘ must never become a state - licensed profession ’			2
some argued that because the @entity172 licenses drivers , it could therefore license the media			2
but in her view , ‘ driving a car is n’t a fundamental human right			2
’ she also said she was opposed to @entity24 ’s demand for ‘ statutory underpinning ’ of the new regulator			0
media commentator @entity183 's guide to the options for press regulation ... what is being proposed ? there are two versions of the @entity9 on regulating @entity58 ’s press under consideration			1
the first is a cross-party proposal formulated in @entity141 leader @entity140 ’s office late on the night of march 18 , with representatives from the other two main political parties and four members of hacked off present – but conspicuously , nobody from the @entity199 is the alternative proposal ? there is a separate proposal by the newspaper industry for an @entity204 which it insists will meet the recommendations of last year ’s @entity37 into media standards – without introducing state - sponsored regulation			0
this proposal is supported by most of the country ’s national , regional and local newspapers and magazines			0
the @entity212 and the @entity204 are the only two national newspaper titles out of 11 that have not signed @entity215 are the areas of agreement ? both proposals agree on the need for a new press regulator to be recognised by a genuinely independent body			0
both acknowledge that a @entity9 , rather than statute , is the best way to achieve this aim			0
they both propose tough sanctions , including the new regulator having the power to impose fines of up to £ 1 million for systematic wrongdoing			0
other areas in common include up - front corrections , with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently , and strong investigative powers enabling the regulator to examine wrongdoing and call editors to account			0
in fact , the two parties have moved a significant distance over the past few weeks in the degree to which they agree			0
why will the newspaper industry not recognise the cross-party charter ? the newspaper industry disagrees fundamentally with certain details of the cross-party proposal			0
it believes a number of its recommendations are unworkable in practice , and could lead to unintended consequences			0
for instance , there are fears that offering a free arbitration service to anyone who feels unfairly treated by the press will lead to ‘ fine farming ’ , in which issues that would have been solved by compromise will now be motivated by financial gain			1
it also believes it gives politicians an unacceptable degree of interference in the regulation of the press			0
how does the newspapers ’ proposal differ from the cross-party proposal ? the newspapers ’ proposal would : what ’s happening currently ? the cross-party @entity9 has been temporarily withdrawn as the @entity52 examines the newspaper industry ’s alternative document			0
both parties claim they will not surrender any ground			0
have there already been consequences of @entity5 ’s report ? yes			0
@entity5 suggested that unless exceptional circumstance applied , the names of those arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public			0
fourteen of the 43 police forces in @entity288 and @entity289 are now keeping secret the names of suspects even when they have been charged			0
@entity1 , an adviser to the @entity37 , has described this controversial practice as ‘ chilling ’			0
what ’s the likely outcome ? the government is well aware that there ’s a serious risk the press will refuse to seek recognition from the new body , which would render the scheme totally unworkable			0
then , politicians would have to impose regulation upon the press by legislation – which nobody wants			0
it is in everybody ’s interests to come to an agreement , and to properly address certain key points of the proposal			1
so it is likely negotiations will continue until a compromise has been reached			0

@entity141 ’s @entity324 and the @entity142 ’ @entity316 became the first mps to break ranks with their party leaders to oppose a @entity9 scheme giving @entity329 the power to dictate terms over the press			0
their move came after the privy council said the plan would not be considered until it had studied the industry ’s proposal for a rigorous system of regulation – which would keep the press free from state interference			1
last night , ms @entity324 warned the @entity9 scheme would crush campaigning journalism			0
‘ if the @entity9 plan had been in existence at the time of the @entity325 ’ expenses scandal , the revelations would never have emerged , ’ she said			1
‘ there is an element of revenge to this			0
@entity353 mp is also opposed to a @entity9 ‘ i have always been uneasy about the huge influence wielded by a small , cliquey , elite			1
it is wrong to introduce legislation to cover up the misdemeanours and embarrassment of the high and mighty			0
’ ms @entity324 said the @entity9 scheme could also have a ‘ devastating effect ’ on local newspapers : ‘ the cost of dealing with large numbers of complaints , many trivial or vexatious , will be huge and could drive them out of business			1
’ she was supported by @entity142 mr @entity316 , who said : ‘ i was worried about a @entity9 that would be controlled by the government – but the newspapers are proposing one which is not subject to the whim of the prime minister of the day			0
some people are not committed to free speech and to have them in a position of power over the press is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop			1

@entity11 boss was judge 's key assessor
she will open huge rift by saying plan is threat to free speech
