by @entity0 over two - thirds of people believe litter and graffiti make an area look rundown - but this does n't stop us from littering we may have a reputation as being a reserved lot , but the @entity10 are actually a nation of rule - breakers			1
a study has found that many people break 260 rules a year - but we ca n't really claim to be dare - devils as , for most of us , this brush with danger involves using a neighbour 's bin or pinching stationary from the office			1
research shows that the average @entity23 knowingly breaks five rules every week , which amounts to 16,250 acts of rebellion in the average adult lifetime			1
dropping cigarette butts and sticking chewing gum to surfaces are among commonly flouted decencies , according to the report by cleaning specialists @entity33			1
cycling on the pavement , using other people 's @entity37 and ignoring ' do not walk on the grass ' signs are also sins we regularly commit			1
but less than a fifth of us ( 18 per cent ) actually feel guilty about these little misdemeanours			2
other common acts of defiance include sneakily trimming a neighbour 's hedge , not returning library books or sitting in a reserved train seat			1
meanwhile , stealing sachets of sauce from cafes , parking on double yellow lines and pretending children are younger to pay cheaper entrance fees are shady acts @entity56 are frequently guilty of			1
nearly half of us ( 41 per cent ) blame ' being in a rush ' for disregarding rules and laws , and many of us struggle to see the victim in many of our mini crimes			1
the study , of 2,000 adults , found two thirds ( 68 per cent ) only feel guilty if the wounded party is obviously a small business or single person rather than a large corporation			2
but it seems we 're utterly hypocritical , taking a very dim view of others ' transgressions			2
nearly half of us ( 41 per cent ) blame ' being in a rush ' for disregarding rules and laws , and many of us struggle to see the victim in many of our midsdemeanours we are infuriated when we witness other people neglecting the environment , with those who do n't pick up dog mess being the most annoying by far ( 75 per cent )			1
six in ten are wound up by those who throw litter from a car window ( 59 per cent ) , 57 per cent annoyed by dropping chewing gum on the floor and leaving litter on the train or bus riles 44 per cent			1
over two - thirds of people ( 69 per cent ) believe litter and graffiti make an area look rundown , with other bug - bears including unkempt gardens ( 59 per cent ) and cigarette ends on the floor ( 49 per cent )			1
eighty per cent says it makes them feel proud when their area has been tidied up - and there 's no graffiti in sight how our street , local area or community area looks certainly affects our mood , with 80 per cent saying it makes them feel proud when their area has been tidied up			2
and it can also impact property values			2
research shows external mess and signs of neglect can wipe 5 per cent off the price , equating to an 8,000pounds loss on the average @entity10 property			1
run in conjunction with charity @entity127 , the ' @entity131 ' campaign encourages people to clean up their streets and keep them tidy throughout 2013			1
psychologist professor @entity134 , of @entity135 , says we break rules we do n't perceive as serious			1
prof @entity137 said : ' only certain groups of people will break these rules , and they do it because they do n't really see it as serious			1
' they might rationalise something like dropping litter to themselves as ' well , i pay my taxes for someone to pick up after me '			1
' other very legalistic structured types will adhere to the rules no matter what			1
it 's about priorities - rule breakers do n't see the rules they flout as a priority			1
' as for looking down on others who break rules , human beings are very idiosyncratic			2
' we will adhere to certain rules ourselves and castigate others for not doing so , but hvae no qualms about brekaing other rules			2
' clearly , brits see these minor municipal rules as insignificant but of course if everybody broke them there would be no books in the library and rubbish all over the place			2
' prof @entity134 said behaviour would change if authorities issued on the spot fines or if members of the public told offenders off			2
