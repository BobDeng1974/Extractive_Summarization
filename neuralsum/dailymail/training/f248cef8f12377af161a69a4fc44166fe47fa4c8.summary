@entity0 is recalling the day , while on @entity2 duty , that @entity3 marched unannounced into his hotel room to see what the noise was about			1
‘ he heard me playing my guitar , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ he was only in for two minutes			2
he picked it up , had a go , put it down and away he went again			0
he seemed like he could play , i ’ll give him that			0
i think at one point he was really good but he ’s got about 14 jobs now , has n’t he ? ’ there is a telling smile			0
no discussion with @entity0 could ever be complete without the subject of music being broached and the spin - off from him discussing @entity23 ’s new album @entity24 - his record of choice this week - is how he is teaching himself to play the guitar			1
@entity28 left - back @entity0 is well - known for his love of music and is learning to play guitar @entity0 has spent the last seven seasons at @entity32 and is an integral member of the @entity28 team @entity0 and fellow defender @entity35 are regarded as two of the best full - backs in the @entity38 during the past 12 months , images have been plentiful of @entity0 heading off to games , either for @entity28 or @entity2 , with his bags in one hand and a guitar casually slung over his shoulders			1
it has captured attention but this is no expensive fashion accessory			0
‘ i do n’t get the chance to play at home , ’ @entity0 explains			1
‘ i try to sneak 20 minutes but when the kids are around , well , you know what it ’s like … i have n’t been doing it that long			0
when we travel , a lot of the lads just sleep , chill out and relax			0
i ’m not a sleeper though			0
‘ i ’m not good with time , really			2
it was something i was always intrigued about so i just started taking it with me			0
‘ i ’ve had a couple of lessons in @entity66 but i ’ve been using the internet			0
i ’ve not called in anyone famous … i would n’t dare ! ’ @entity0 was seen carrying his guitar whilst on duty for @entity2 in both in @entity71 and @entity72 this summer @entity0 , pictured with @entity74 frontman @entity73 and @entity75 , attended @entity76 last year so what reaction does he get from his @entity28 and @entity2 team - mates who would be more au fait with playstations or an @entity81 ? ‘ to be honest , nobody says anything , ’ @entity0 replies			1
‘ i thought i might get a bit of stick , as daft as that might sound			0
you know what the environment is like but they just accepted it			0
i imagine if someone else had done it , there would have been a bit of stick flying around but they just left me to it			2
’ this is not a run - of - the - mill conversation but , then again , @entity0 is not your average footballer			1
he will not , for instance , spend hours watching @entity104 , preferring instead to bury his head in a book - he is currently reading @entity107 by the @entity109 author @entity108			2
but he needs to keep occupied and , during our time together , the issue arises of what happens when his playing career is over			1
that wo n’t happen any time soon - he is 29 and committed himself to @entity28 for five more years in january - but he has thought about the future			1
will it involve football ? left back @entity0 , not your average footballer , prefers to read rather than spend hours watching @entity104 ‘ i hope not , ’ comes the refreshing answer			1
‘ as much as i love it - the reason i do n’t watch or read about it now is because i am giving everything i can to it - any bits of time that are my own , i come away from it			1
‘ so when i finish , i think i will get that passion back as i wo n’t be involved in it			2
i reckon i would go back as a fan but i ’d like to do something else			2
i just want to try a different world , with different people , different experiences			1
‘ it ’s not that i ’m not grateful for what i do now , i just want to try to do something different			0
i have always been thinking about the next move because it would n’t be good for me not to have a job or not have to get up to do something			0
’ @entity0 is @entity28 's set - piece specialist and often hits the back of the net from the penalty spot for the @entity146 the @entity28 left - back coolly slots the ball home during the @entity28 ' 4 - 1 @entity151 win over @entity152 why ? ‘ killing time at home is easy , is n’t it ? ’ he says			1
‘ you get a coffee , you have a read , you do the school run			0
by the time 9pm comes , you have an hour to unwind and then you conk out			2
the scary bit will come when the football stops , the kids are grown up and they do n’t rely on you			2
‘ i ’m aware that when i stop playing , i ’m going to have to roll into something else			2
it would n’t be healthy for the alarm to go off and not have something to do			0
’ @entity0 admits ' it would n't be healthy to not have something to do ' when his playing career is over honesty is one of @entity0 ’s virtues			1
he will not duck a question , so when talk turns back to how he viewed events in @entity72 - as @entity2 ’s @entity179 campaign ran aground inside six days , @entity0 found himself in the firing line - he does not offer excuses			1
‘ i ’ve touched on it a few times , ’ says a man who now has 28 caps			0
‘ we should n’t still be dwelling on it at this point			0
of course it was hugely disappointing the way that it went but you still reflect on it			2
‘ everyone came home hurting but you go away , you have your holiday and try to move on			2
for me , it was spending time with people who meant more to me than football - my family			1
i went away to @entity201 with my mum and dad , sister , my wife and three kids			0
@entity0 spent time on holiday with his family following @entity2 's disappointing @entity179 campaign ‘ you do still go back and think about it because it was so disappointing			1
of course , you understand the criticism			0
’ the ability to apply perspective is crucial , particularly during weeks such as this			0
@entity28 ’s season has not gone according to plan so far and two defeats in the space of 72 hours - at home in the @entity38 against @entity220 and then knocked out of the @entity221 by @entity222 - have left supporters anxious ahead of saturday ’s derby			1
yet @entity0 remains positive , extolling his manager @entity225 ’s blueprint			1
@entity28 lost to @entity220 at home on sunday despite @entity0 scoring from the spot late on in the game ‘ he keeps us thinking , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ you have got to be a thinking footballer and understand what he wants from you			0
there is no position that is played in the traditional , conventional way			0
‘ i think it ’s that thing of always trying to find something new , another aspect to your game			0
he has talked about using me in different positions ( @entity225 feels @entity0 has the class to play as a holding midfielder ) and something like that keeps you on your toes			2
’ he will certainly be on his toes at 12.45pm on saturday as @entity28 seek to avenge last season ’s chastening 4 - 0 defeat at @entity251			1
@entity0 , set to makes his 288th club appearance , hopes the time has arrived for a first success behind enemy lines			1
@entity0 and the rest of the @entity28 team will be hoping for victory against @entity259 at @entity251 on saturday @entity0 was interviewed courtesy of @entity28 ’s official sponsor @entity262 at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity265			1
follow on @entity266 and @ @entity267			0
