by @entity0 attack : @entity2 will accuse firms of targeting vulnerable families and causing misery for millions @entity6 was under increasing pressure to stop the spread of fixed - odds betting terminals last night			1
labour leader @entity2 announced plans to give councils the power to ban the gambling machines , which have been dubbed the ‘ crack cocaine of the high street ’			1
mr @entity2 admitted @entity16 , which allowed the creation of the machines in the @entity19 , had ‘ changed our mind ’ , following widespread concern that the machines are addictive for problem gamblers			1
bookmakers now rake in more than £ 1billion a year in profits from the machines , which allow punters to gamble up to £ 300 a minute , or £ 18,000 an hour , mostly on electronic roulette			1
mr @entity2 said he would legislate to put betting shops in a separate planning class so that councils can control the number opening in their area			1
that plan has already been backed by the @entity36 at their party conference			2
currently betting shops are classified as ‘ financial and professional services ’ , which means that one can open in any building that used to be a bank , building society , estate agent or employment agency without needing planning permission			2
@entity16 would also legislate to give councils the power to revoke or reduce the number of @entity49 in betting shops , currently capped at four , potentially to zero			1
finally , the party says it would legislate to increase the time between plays , curtrently once every 20 seconds , requiring on screen warnings and breaks in play			2
industry : fixed odds betting temrinals ( @entity59 ) make more than £ 1billion a year in @entity60 mr @entity2 said : ‘ there ’s clearly a massive and growing epidemic in some parts of our country of people losing huge amounts of money on these fixed odds betting machines			1
our high streets are turning into high stakes , high cost venues for gambling			2
‘ i ’m not objecting to having a betting shop or two on my high street but i do n’t think people want the high street to be full of betting shops			2
‘ it ’s right that we stand up to a powerful and important industry , the gambling industry			0
the betting industry has its place in the country but we ca n’t let them dominate our decisions			2
’ @entity6 has expressed concern about the issue but the @entity89 has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on gambling machines is conducted - due to report back in the autumn			2
campaign : @entity2 is backed by @entity96 including @entity97 ( pictured ) in a policy break from @entity16 , which attempted to allow ' super casinos ' mr @entity2 accused the government of failing to act			1
‘ they seem incredibly reluctant to act			0
i want to force them to act			0
i ’d rather they acted now rather than wait 18 months			0
they should stand up to the vested interests			0
mr @entity2 conceded that @entity16 ’s gambling policy from 2005 has proved problematic			1
‘ we ’ve changed our approach on the basis of the evidence			0
tuition fee repeat ? @entity114 has been accused of going against his word after voting against curbs on betting terminals this month in 2007/8 when the supercasinos were stopped people thought that was the big issue , actually this turned out to be as important an issue and it needs to be dealt with			1
we ’re responding to the evidence , which is concerning and worrying			0
something needs to be done			0
’ mr @entity2 will stop short of agreeing with one key demand of campaigners against the proliferation of the machines , which is for the maximum stake to be slashed to £ 2 per spin			1
but he told the @entity132 : ‘ we do n’t rule that out			0
we do n’t rule out going further			0
’ the @entity134 accused @entity16 of hypocrisy for accepting hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations from top gambling figures , including @entity138 of @entity139 and industry lobbyist @entity140 , the former boss of the @entity141			1
in total , @entity16 have received £ 192,000 of cash from @entity140 and @entity138 - with some of the donations being registered only months ago			1
two key members of his @entity145 , @entity147 and @entity148 , have also pocketed cash directly from gambling tycoons			0
but mr @entity2 said his policy would not be affected by the donations			1
‘ there are people who are @entity16 supporters in all walks of life , whether they ’re @entity16 supporters or not we ’ll do the right thing for the country			1
’ @entity159 , founder of the @entity160 and stop the @entity161 , said : ‘ we welcome this announcement and look forward to the national debate that now looks set to take place			0
the @entity165 ca n’t continue to delay action on @entity49 any longer			0
’ the @entity141 condemned the plans			0
a spokesman said : ‘ this announcement has nothing to do with helping problem gamblers ; it is simply about playing politics with the jobs of 40,000 people , and the enjoyment of 8 million customers for no reason			0
’ @entity6 has expressed concern about the issue but the @entity89 has delayed any action while a review of betting habits on gambling machines is conducted			2
it is due to report back in the autumn .			0
