gen. @entity7 stood ramrod straight before a judge thursday and pleaded guilty to three charges that could send him to prison for up to 15 years			1
it was a remarkable admission sure to end the military career of a man once regarded as a rising star among the @entity18 's small cadre of trusted battle commanders			1
@entity7 , 51 , still faces five other charges stemming from the claims of a female captain nearly 20 years his junior who says the general twice forced her to perform oral sex			1
but by pleading guilty to the lesser charges , @entity7 's lawyers believe they will strengthen his case at trial by potentially limiting some of the salacious evidence prosecutors can present			1
opening statements were expected friday			0
asked by judge col. @entity46 whether he clearly understood the consequences of his admissions , the decorated veteran of five combat deployments answered in a clear voice , with no emotion : ' yes sir			0
' @entity46 accepted @entity7 's plea after nearly three hours of often intimate questions about the married general 's flirtations and dalliances with four women - three military officers and one civilian			1
repeatedly , @entity7 turned to his lawyer before answering , prompting the judge to say : ' it 's important that you tell me the truth as you recall it			1
' ' you 'll get nothing but the truth from me , ' the general replied			0
the case against @entity7 , believed to be the most senior member of the @entity73 military ever to face trial on sexual assault charges , comes as the @entity76 grapples with revelations of rampant rape and sexual misconduct within the ranks			1
the @entity81 on thursday blocked a bill that would have stripped senior military commanders of their authority to prosecute rapes and other serious offenses in the ranks			2
the bill was firmly opposed by the @entity76			0
the general pleaded guilty to having improper relationships with two female @entity18 officers and to committing adultery with a third , the captain who was his longtime mistress			1
adultery is a crime in the military			1
when asked by the judge if he was aware of the prohibition against senior officers having relations with subordinates , @entity7 replied , ' oh , yes sir			1
' rising star : @entity7 was once considered a rising star amongst military brass			1
his career is now likely to be over he then described how the affair began during a war tour in @entity110 when his primary accuser asked if he wanted to watch a movie			0
once they were alone in his quarters , the general said the young officer made sexual advances that he initially rebuffed			2
@entity46 asked how @entity7 knew the woman wanted to have sex with him			2
' probably when she took her top off , sir , ' the general said with a nervous chuckle			0
@entity7 's wife of nearly 30 years has remained with him through his legal troubles and served as a staunch public defender , though she was not in the courtroom thursday			2
the couple has two children			0
the general admitted to violating orders by possessing pornography and to conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman			0
after he knew he was under investigation , @entity7 also said he deleted nude photos from a personal email account sent by a civilian woman with whom he was childhood friends			2
@entity7 's lawyer @entity138 has said the plea will strengthen the general 's legal position			2
by admitting guilt on the charges for which there is the strongest evidence , the married father of two hoped to narrow the focus of the trial to charges that rely heavily on the testimony and credibility of his former mistress			2
life : @entity7 is a former deputy commander of the @entity39 and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the sexual assaults in pleading guilty to possessing a cache of porn on his laptop in @entity162 , a violation of orders for soldiers in the socially conservative @entity167 country , @entity7 's defense hopes to limit the ability of prosecutors to use those graphic images to shock the jury			1
prosecutors also have evidence @entity7 asked two female officers to send nude photos of themselves to him			1
by conceding his guilt , the defense lessens the relevance of the messages they exchanged			0
the primary accuser is the only one alleging assault			2
@entity138 said @entity7 had long offered to plead guilty to the three charges as part of a plea agreement , but the @entity18 refused to make any deal without an admission on the alleged assault			1
' what remains of this case really rests on the damaged and tattered credibility of an individual who 's not been truthful , who has lied before the court , who has given inconsistent statements , ' @entity138 said outside the courthouse			0
' frankly , i think it 's an embarrassment that this case will go forward			0
but it 's going forward , and we 'll have not guilty verdicts at the end			0
' the defense will present evidence that the female captain lied under oath during a pretrial hearing in january about her handling of old @entity211 containing messages between her and the general			2
lawyers for @entity7 have painted the woman as a scorned lover who only reported the sexual assault allegations after the general refused to leave his wife			1
stand by your man : @entity7 's wife has stood with him throughout the many allegations of sexual wrongdoing the captain testified that on dec. 9 , shortly after what she described as a contentious meeting with prosecutors , she rediscovered the @entity211 stored in a box at her home that still contained saved text messages and voicemails from the general			1
after charging the phone , she testified she synced it with her computer to save photos before contacting her attorney			0
however , a defense expert 's examination suggested the captain powered up the device more than two weeks before the meeting with prosecutors			0
the @entity0 generally does not identify those who say they were sexually assaulted			0
during a pretrial hearing this week , a top @entity76 lawyer testified that the lead prosecutor assigned to the case for nearly two years , lt. col. @entity250 , had urged that the most serious charges against @entity7 be dropped after he became convinced the captain had lied to him about the cellphone			1
@entity250 was overruled by his superiors and removed from the case last month , after suffering what was described as a profound moral crisis that led to his being taken to a military hospital for a mental health evaluation			0
the new lead prosecutor , lt. col. @entity259 , said in court this week he does n't care what his predecessor thought about the weakness of the evidence			0
it is highly unusual for an officer of flag rank to face criminal prosecution , with only a handful of cases in recent decades			0
under military law , an officer can only be judged at trial by those of superior rank			1
@entity7 's jury is comprised of five major generals .			2

@entity7 pleaded guilty to having improper relationships with two female @entity18 officers
he also pleaded guilty to adultery for having a sexual relationship with his longtime mistress , an @entity18 captain
adultery is a crime under military law
@entity7 still faces sexual assault charges that could land him in prison for life
