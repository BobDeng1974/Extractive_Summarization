@entity1 manager @entity0 has attempted to protect out - of - sorts striker @entity2 by calling on the rest of his team - mates to share the goalscoring burden to keep the team in the @entity7			1
@entity2 , strongly linked with a move to @entity9 or @entity10 when his contract at @entity12 runs out in the summer , has n't scored since february 11 — a run of eight matches — and missed his side 's best chance in saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity18 that left @entity1 bottom			1
as a team , they have scored just one goal in their last seven matches and while @entity0 needs 23 - year - old @entity2 to rediscover his mojo quickly , starting with the critical home game against relegation rivals @entity26 , he insists it 's unfair to pin the club 's survival hopes on one man			1
@entity1 striker @entity2 is struggling for form at the moment and has n't scored since february 11 @entity18 full - back @entity33 ( right ) comes forward with the ball as @entity2 ( left ) gives chase on saturday @entity2 runs away in celebration after scoring for @entity1 against @entity9 at @entity37 in february @entity1 manager @entity0 insists that the rest of his players must help to relieve the pressure on @entity2 ' yes , @entity2 needs to find his goal touch but it 's not just him			1
you want everyone and anyone to score			0
@entity46 ( @entity47 ) has got goals , @entity49 's chipped in			0
@entity50 had a great chance against @entity18 so the whole team has to step up to the plate			1
' i 'd be questioning us more if we were n't creating chances but we have been creating			0
it 's rare at this level that you see a whole plethora of chances , say 15 or 20 like you see in other leagues , so when your chances come you have to take them			0
' @entity2 was mentioned in the same breath as @entity67 not so long ago but you could see a lack of confidence as he misdirected a header from a @entity73 cross in the closing minutes			2
it is 43 months since @entity18 last lost a 3pm saturday home game , a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity78 which marked @entity80 ' first match in charge as the visitors ' new owner			1
@entity18 won the game with a first - half goal from @entity86 who was later fortunate not to become the second player to be dismissed by referee @entity89 when he caught @entity90 on the shin			2
@entity1 's @entity92 had earlier been sent off for two bookable challenges , a decision @entity0 had no complaints about			1
@entity18 's stand - out performer was winger @entity97 who has impressed since a january loan move from @entity99			2
even so , manager @entity100 insists there are no plans at this stage to sign him on a permanent basis			2
' with all honesty , we are not going to think about that situation until the season is over , ' said @entity100			0
' when you have a loan player it is always a three - way conversation			2
the player is the first one that needs to make a decision and the parent club has a big say			0
i 've never been worried about what is going to happen at the end of it			0
' you see sometimes when you make loan moves permanent , they do n't work out			0
then sometimes it is the opposite , you sign a loan player and he becomes the best player you could ever sign because you know him and they know the way the team works			0
' @entity18 's young @entity135 player @entity134 suffered the indignity of missing an early penalty when he stepped up instead of @entity138 , whose conversion rate in the @entity7 is 15 from 16			1
even so , @entity100 insists he will continue to leave it to the players to decide who takes penalties if the regular taker @entity145 is n't on the pitch			0
@entity18 winger @entity86 scores his side 's winning goal against @entity1 at @entity149 on saturday @entity18 's star performer against @entity1 was @entity97 who is currently on loan at the club from @entity99 @entity18 manager @entity100 , however , has not let on if he intends to sign @entity97 permanently or not			1

@entity1 manager @entity0 is keen to protect striker @entity2
@entity2 has not scored since february as @entity1 *battle* relegation
although @entity0 would like @entity2 to return to form as soon as possible , he has made it clear other @entity1 players must step up to the plate as well
the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity18 last time out has left @entity1 bottom of the @entity7 table with 26 points from 33 games
