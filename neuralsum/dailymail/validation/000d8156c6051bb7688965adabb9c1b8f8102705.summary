@entity0 has urged @entity1 to will @entity2 to victory on saturday evening as he prepares to order his @entity5 title hopefuls to carry the game to @entity7			1
@entity0 believes the noisy support of a sold - out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role to play in edging rivals @entity11 and @entity12 for @entity14 glory on a nerve - jangling final day of staggered kick - offs			1
@entity2 are favourites to lift a first piece of silverware under @entity0 and their head coach refuses to view the match through the prism of the looming @entity21 on these shores			1
@entity2 scrum half @entity23 fires out a pass as @entity26 and @entity27 ( left ) watch on ' it will be hugely important that the crowd get behind the team , ' @entity0 said			1
' if there 's ever a day when we need the crowd to push us over the line and give us the momentum we need then it 's saturday			1
' whether we just need to get the win or win by 10 points or whatever it might take , the crowd will have a huge part to play			1
' this game is not about the @entity21 , it 's about winning the @entity14			2
and that 's all it 's about			2
it 's about saturday night only			2
' our mindset is to go and win the game			2
we ca n't play just to hang in there			0
we have to have a front foot mentality and have an intensity and tempo to our game from the first minute			0
' @entity2 fly half @entity53 winds up a pass in training at his side 's team base at @entity59 @entity2 head coach @entity60 has backed his side to handle the pressure of their final day shoot - out @entity2 enter the final round of matches with a points cushion of plus four and having digested earlier results from @entity12 ' trip to @entity71 and @entity11 's visit to @entity73 , their victory target against @entity7 will be made clear			1
the scheduling appears to have favoured @entity2 , but @entity0 insists providing the climax to the tournament creates its own challenges			1
' i do n't think we can be seen as favourites			0
i do n't think anyone can			0
it will play out on the day , ' @entity0 said			1
' whether the staggered kick - offs help us depends on what the other scores are			2
' if we have to win by 20 , psychologically if you concede seven points in the first five minutes and then a penalty , you then have to score 30			2
' psychologically it 's an interesting dynamic for the players to manage			0
the danger is that sometimes you can want to chase the game too early rather than build the score			0
' it 's an 80 - minute game			2
knowing that is one thing , but dealing with everything that 's around it puts incredible pressure on the players			0
the @entity2 squad gather for a huddle at the end of their training session as @entity106 looks on from afar former @entity7 no 8 @entity107 insists all the pressure will be on @entity2 on saturday ' on the staggered kick - off times , we all know the rules when we start			1
' @entity0 has made one change to the starting xv , promoting lock @entity116 at the expense of @entity118 , who drops out of the 23 altogether , with @entity119 recalled to the bench			1
@entity118 has started all four matches of the tournament but misses out on the final instalment with @entity0 believing the street-wise @entity124 is a better option to reinforce the final push for silverware			1
' when you boil it down , it 's the experience that @entity116 brings			0
he did n't go on the @entity131 tour by accident , he 's a high quality player , ' @entity0 said			2
' @entity118 is a very good player who has lots of qualities , but @entity119 will make a stronger impact from the bench and that 's why the decision was made			0
' @entity118 understood the decision			0
there were performance reasons as well			0
it was n't just done because of @entity116			0
there are areas of @entity118 's game we 've been asking him to improve on			0
' it was a difficult conversation but ultimately done on a performance point of view			0
@entity118 accepted it and knows the areas he has to work on			0
' @entity2 have finished runners = up for the last three years running with points difference alone deciding the 2013 and 2014 tournaments			1
when asked if he was fed up at finishing second , @entity0 said : ' yes ! it would be nice to win this time			1

@entity2 will know what points target is needed by the time they run out to face @entity160 at @entity1 on saturday
coach @entity0 believes the noisy support of a sold - out 82,000 home crowd will have a critical role
