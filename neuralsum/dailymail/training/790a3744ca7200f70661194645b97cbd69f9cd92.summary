by @entity0 at 8.30am on a saturday , you would expect to find most children in front of the tv with a bowl of cornflakes , or in bed			2
instead , 12 - year - old @entity8 is dashing up a sizeable hill in @entity10 , @entity11 , being timed with a stopwatch by her personal trainer			1
she has already done an arduous mini-circuit , involving push - ups , squats , lunges , knee - lifts and some serious grappling with a @entity20 suspension training device hooked to a trees to build up her core strength			0
in training : @entity25 with @entity8 , left , and @entity26 , both 12 by the end , @entity8 , who is 5 ft 5 in and weighs a trim 8 stone 2 lbs , is sweaty and exhausted			1
her mother , @entity29 , 48 , is thrilled			0
this is because trainer @entity25 has managed what @entity29 has been failing to do for some time : coax her daughter off the sofa and into a pair of running shoes			1
' @entity8 does an hour of @entity37 a week at school and was at the age when she was n't interested in going to the playground , ' says @entity29			1
' instead , she wants to listen to music , talk to friends on her phone , or watch tv			0
i was worried about her becoming a couch potato			0
she was n't overweight , but i was concerned she was n't moving			2
' @entity8 is typical of this generation of children who , this week , were called ' the least active generation in history ' by 2012 @entity52 organiser , lord @entity53			1
this was on the back of a new parliamentary report , which found half of children aged seven do n't exercise enough , and will live shorter lives as a result			2
while @entity53 is calling for ' breakfast fitness clubs ' , so pupils exercise before the day starts , mothers like @entity29 are outsourcing the problem , paying up to £ 200 a month to enlist a personal trainer			1
instead of turning off the tv and organising a trip to the park , the modern solution for time - stretched parents is to employ someone to do their nagging for them			2
@entity29 , who works full - time in publishing , heard about @entity25 through other parents and signed @entity8 up for the classes			1
' i wanted to encourage her to stay fit and healthy , but in a positive way , rather than telling her constantly that she 'd be fat if she kept eating biscuits , ' says @entity29			0
' @entity25 's sessions seemed perfect			1
some saturdays , @entity8 is reluctant , but when she gets going , she loves it			0
she 's been having sessions once a week for 18 months and is incredibly fit			1
on a recent break to @entity85 i was in awe of how she climbed a steep hill without getting out of breath			0
' it 's inspired @entity8 to take responsibility for her health			2
she 's now walking part of her way to school , instead of taking the bus			2
' workout : sean with nine - year - old @entity97 and ten - year - old @entity98 with the report claiming just half of seven - year - olds meet government recommendations of an hour 's moderate to vigorous physical activity a day , with activity levels halving again between ages nine and 15 , it 's little wonder middle - class parents like @entity29 are turning to experts			1
figures from the @entity110 reveal that 28 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese , and increasing reliance on @entity113 , @entity114 and mobiles for entertainment is a big contributing factor			2
worrying projections suggest that , without effective intervention , six out of ten children will be dangerously overweight by 2050			2
@entity25 , 52 , has about 20 children on her books , most around @entity8 's age or younger , each paying £ 5 for an hour - long session			1
she qualified as a trainer three years ago , after a career as a business development consultant			0
as a mum to a ten - year - old son and 13 - year - old daughter , she saw the need for her services			0
' state schools do n't have the resources to do a lot of sport , so parents are looking for alternatives , ' says @entity25			1
' the children may moan at the start , especially if it 's cold or raining , but they 're with friends , and end up having a laugh			1
there 's a real sense of achievement at the end			2
' @entity148 , 51 , from @entity11 , hired @entity25 in response to 12 - year - old daughter @entity26 's sedentary lifestyle			1
her son , @entity151 , 14 , plays a lot of sport , but finding a sport @entity26 enjoyed was more tricky			0
' she refuses to walk to school and i worried about how little exercise she was doing , ' says @entity148			0
' when we went shopping , she 'd lag behind and i 'd have to nag her to keep up			0
' @entity26 , who is 5 ft 2 in and weighs 7 stone 7lb , says her enjoyment of the sessions depends on her mood , but she loves the hill dash ' as it 's made my legs so much stronger '			2
is n't enlisting a personal trainer just another way for harried parents to palm responsibility off to hired help ? what happened to a family game of rounders in the park ? @entity25 worries about this , too			1
' so much of how children progress is to do with parents ' influence			1
they have to project the right image and be active , ' she says			0
' but parents are living high - pressure lives and feel guilty about not doing as much exercise with their family as they 'd like			2
that 's where i step in			2
' trainer @entity25 ( centre of both images ) has managed what @entity29 has been failing to do for some time : coax children daughter off the sofa and into a pair of running shoes ( pictured : @entity8 , left , and @entity26 , both 12 ) across the @entity200 , @entity196 - which offers high intensity strength and conditioning circuit classes for adults - has spawned a junior version , @entity202 , which is attracting parents in droves			1
@entity205 , 40 , a manager from @entity206 , has been sending her son @entity97 , nine , and daughter @entity98 , ten , to @entity209 's @entity202 classes once a week for the past six months , paying £ 5 a time , and has hired @entity209 to top @entity98 up with an extra weekly one - on - one session , at £ 30 an hour			1
' i probably spend around £ 200 a month on their fitness , ' says @entity205			2
' it 's worth it as it is setting them up with skills to keep healthy for life			0
' @entity205 , a fit size six , and husband @entity221 are into @entity196 themselves , and do five classes a week			1
' @entity97 and @entity98 were only doing two @entity37 sessions a week at school			1
even then , it was the first class to be dumped if they had a special assignment or presentation , ' says @entity205			0
in a normal 45 - minute session , @entity209 , 31 , does squats , deadlifts , press - ups , sit - ups and box - jumps , all of which are scaled , according to a child 's weight and ability			1
a former primary school teacher , he earns about £ 210 a week from his young clientele , seeing about five children one - to - one , and running a weekly @entity202 and @entity245 class , with ten to 12 children in each			1
and the interest is growing			0
' teenage girls are often sent to me because they 've put on a bit of weight and want to lose it , ' says @entity209			1
' one young client was thrilled because she dropped a dress size			0
' when they first come , they struggle to hold a squat for more than 30 seconds			0
as the weeks go on , they can hold the positions for longer			0
' the problem , according to @entity209 , is that schools are geared towards traditional or competitive sports , and some children lose interest			1
since going to his sessions , @entity209 has seen a big change in @entity98			1
‘ she 's a quiet girl , but when we do the session , she comes alive , ' he says			0
@entity205 agrees : ' @entity98 , who is 4 ft 5 in and weighs 5 stone 1 lb , is always buzzing after her sessions , telling me how many pull - ups or box - jumps she did , and how much stronger and more confident she feels			0
' all this after - school activity does eat away at @entity205 's time with her children			1
' i have to fight the guilt , ' she says			0
' i worry we 're not spending as much time as a family , or one - to - one , as i 'd like			0
but then , i see how much the children benefit			0
' @entity281 , campaigner and former director of @entity283 , which campaigns for greater provision of childhood play , is less enthusiastic			0
' this seems a sad indictment of the modern world , ' he says			0
' given the freedom to play outdoors , children will get the physical exercise they need			0
children of all ages should be able to play out near their homes naturally			0
parents should n't have to resort to paying to get their kids to exercise			1

@entity25 trains a number of youngsters in @entity11
@entity209 runs @entity202 classes once a week
parents are paying them to get their children moving
