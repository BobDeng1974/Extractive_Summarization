as a breakfast show presenter , i spend my life turning down invitations			2
my alarm goes off at 2.40am every morning and an ' early to bed , early to rise regime ' does n't permit anything like a normal social life			1
so an invitation from @entity12 's @entity11 hotel to test their new sleep programme was obviously just my thing			1
i am obsessed with sleep			2
i can fall asleep at the drop of a hat - not just on trains and in cars , but even once during root - canal surgery			0
but was i getting the right type of sleep ? the @entity11 's programme focuses not so much on the amount you get , but the quality			1
they look at how you can maximise that through what you eat , and how you unwind before bedtime			2
with the news recently about how women in particular could be putting their health at risk by not getting enough sleep , i wondered if it was time to assess the shut - eye i was getting			2
my next port of call was @entity55 , where i checked out the @entity57 exhibition , then the @entity58 which has more than 2,000 works of art. this trek around the sights meant i was definitely ready for my @entity63			1
it has to be said that the @entity11 is no ordinary hotel			1
its prices are certainly pretty extraordinary , but i had little time to absorb the luxuriously appointed reception as i was ushered off to the spa for an afternoon packed with treatments to ease away any aches and pains and make sure i was fully relaxed before my head hit the pillow			1
this began with a visit to resident osteopath @entity77			0
under his expert treatment , i soon began to feel all my long - held knots of tension disappear			0
early risers : @entity41 with @entity83 presenters @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 time to relax : @entity41 stayed at the @entity87 , which has launched a new sleep programme for guests before my next treatment , there was just time to unwind in one of the @entity94			1
the spa takes up an impressive four floors , and has not only a pool , sauna and steam room but heated marble loungers and an ice fountain			2
the sleep pods are nestled in the middle of the spa in a darkened room , with a flickering fire spilling out a gentle and mesmeric warm light			1
i already felt more relaxed than i had in a long time - but i was only halfway there			0
it was n't long before my next treatments - the @entity108 designed to balance the body 's energies , a @entity113 massage to calm the mind and hot stones to ease tension			2
this was followed by @entity118 - an @entity120 treatment that involves a therapist gently dropping warm oil on your forehead , to soothe the mind			0
it 's a therapy known to induce sleep , which it certainly did with me			2
i drifted off on the massage bed			0
back in my room , i decided it would be too much effort even to change out of my dressing gown for dinner , so i made the most of room service			0
the @entity45 has been specially designed by nutritionist @entity137 to make sure you have all the ingredients you need for a good night 's sleep			1
fresh - faced : @entity41 in her day job presenting @entity83 and , right , stepping out on the red carpet drifting off : @entity41 tries out @entity118 - an @entity120 treatment that involves a therapist gently dropping warm oil on your forehead , to soothe the mind just to make certain you 're not peckish during the night , the hotel even supplies a bedtime snack of banana , sunflower seed and pumpkin cookies with hot milk or valerian tea			1
i started to feel guilty about the biscuits and chocolates i often resort to in the tv studio for that early morning energy boost			0
my body was now set up for sleep , so it was time to turn to the mind			0
sleep expert dr @entity166 advises a routine : half an hour of wind - down time when you switch off all devices , dim the lights and - most importantly - avoid the temptation of using your phone or computer , as the light they emit makes your body think it is daylight			0
i began to realise you ca n't cheat sleep			0
in a busy day , all too often it 's the one thing we skimp on to make sure we cram everything in			0
the few hours spent during my sleep programme really made me think about just how vital my precious night - time hours are if i am to function at my best			1
i slept like a log that night , and felt more refreshed than i had done in a long time			0
the @entity63 at the @entity87 costs from £ 758 based on single occupancy			1
this includes one night 's full - board accommodation and a range of sleep treatments at the @entity192 spa			1
