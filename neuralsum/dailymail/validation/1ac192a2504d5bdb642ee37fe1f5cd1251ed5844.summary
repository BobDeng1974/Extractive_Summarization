the police chief at the @entity2 disaster said it was ' one of the biggest regrets of my life ' he did not think of the consequences of allowing thousand of fans in to the ground after he ordered exit gates to be opened			1
former chief superintendent @entity12 also added that it was his mistake and that he apologises profusely for the events that transpired			2
the match commander at the game agreed to a request to open the gates to prevent crushing at the turnstiles outside the ground , the inquest in @entity16 heard			1
former chief superintendent @entity12 says @entity2 was one of biggest regrets of his life but after @entity25 was opened on his orders at eight minutes before kick off , an estimated 2,000 fans poured in , heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already - packed central pens three and four , behind the goal			1
the jury was told as many as an extra 800 fans went in to pen three alone after the gate was opened			1
ninety - six @entity36 fans died following a crush on the @entity39 terrace of @entity41 's @entity2 ground as the @entity42 semi-final against @entity44 kicked off on april 15 1989			1
mr @entity12 said he now realised ' in hindsight ' the ' most likely ' route fans would take once @entity25 was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens			1
@entity50 , counsel for the inquests , said : ' you say in hindsight you recognise that 's where a number of fans might have gone			2
do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made , and in particular thought as to where the fans might go , is something you should have considered ? ' mr @entity12 replied : ' @entity66 , i think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life , that i did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates			1
' mr @entity12 , who has admitted he had ' limited ' experience of policing football matches compared with other senior officers , added : ' if i had been a fully competent , experienced , knowledgeable match commander of the experience of @entity12 ( @entity79 or mr @entity80 , i no doubt would have thought about it , but i was not in their position			1
' mr @entity12 , stationed in the police control box with a bank of tv monitors of the ground , said he was ' shocked ' at the request to open the gates from superintendent @entity90 from outside @entity39 after police became ' overwhelmed ' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles			1
96 @entity36 fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence in 1989 the witness continued : ' certainly i 'm sat there , i do n't mind telling you i was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking , ' where are these people going to go if i open the gates ? '' he said another message then came through on the police radio from mr @entity90 saying : ' if we do n't open the gates someone 's going to get killed			1
' the witness continued : ' that really was a shocking , terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation			0
' another officer in the police box , mr @entity115 , then said to him : ' are you going to open the gates ? ' the jury heard			0
mr @entity12 said : ' i remember saying to him quite clearly , mr @entity115 , if people are going to die i have no option but to open the gates			2
' he said he was left ' no option ' and thought fans would feel ' relief and comfort ' in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse			0
he added : ' @entity66 , it is difficult to envisage in the quiet of the court room but in that moment when i made a decision of that nature it really is , i 'm at a loss to describe it , other than to say it is a momentous decision and your mind is such that you do n't think upon the next step			0
' mr @entity12 said he did not think before opening the gates about blocking the tunnel off with a line of police officers - as had happened in previous years			2
miss @entity149 said : ' did you even consider for a moment the possibility that they might go through the central tunnel ? ' ' not at all ma'am , ' mr @entity12 replied			2
mr @entity12 added : ' i think it 's fair to say i was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision i had to make			1
' and as a result of that i was so overcome , probably with the emotion of us having got into that situation , that my mind , for a moment , went blank			0
' fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster before the @entity42 semi-final mr @entity12 said there was ' every possibility ' that he panicked , and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens			1
' i think i was so consumed by the events that probably by that time i was overcome and did n't consider delaying the kick - off at that stage			0
' the request was made , the crisis was building , the atmosphere and tension was increasing and i shall never forget ( another policeman ) saying ' it 's too late , the players are on the pitch '			0
' after viewing @entity185 footage of fans on a concourse behind the @entity39 terrace , having passed through @entity25 , mr @entity12 went on : ' i have a view from what i have seen that quite a few of the fans were apparently standing around , waiting for friends or wondering where to go or what to do			1
' the jury has heard that the exit gate remained open for five minutes , allowing fans to flow into the ground			1
miss @entity149 asked mr @entity12 : ' at any stage during those five minutes did it occur to you to wonder where those fans were going ? ' mr @entity12 responded : ' no ma'am			2
' chair of the @entity207 @entity206 arrives at the inquest on tuesday agreeing with miss @entity149 that a match commander of reasonable competence ought to have thought where the fans allowed through the gate might go , the 70 - year - old claimed to have been ' distracted ' by a radio message referring to another gate ' going in '			1
' i wanted resources to be directed to the @entity219 , ' he said			0
' that is why my thought processes moved from where they ( fans ) were going to go , to what would happen next			0
' referring to his failure to realise where fans would go during the five - minute period , the witness continued : ' it certainly was a mistake and an oversight			0
under the circumstances , with my limited ability , i accept it was a mistake - a mistake i should n't have made , a mistake i regret bitterly			0
' it was a grave mistake and i apologise profusely			0
' at 2.59pm , when the match kicked off , mr @entity12 told the jury , he looked towards the @entity39 terrace and had seen ' nothing untoward '			2
miss @entity149 suggested to the former match commander that it might be said to have been ' obvious ' that fans climbing out of the central pens might be connected to the ingress of supporters through @entity246 ' it was not obvious to me ma'am , ' mr @entity12 added			1
' i thought there may have been some crowd disorder or some problem and i was awaiting information			0
' i did n't know what to think			0
i was looking and waiting for information			0
' questioned about when he had realised that something was badly wrong , mr @entity12 added : ' i have a recollection that a young man came from the perimeter track behind the goal and either collapsed or fell down			2
' he was hobbling , i remember seeing him hobbling , and there was a sudden realisation that this was not a pitch invasion , this was a serious situation			0
