by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 20:25 est , 21 october 2013 @entity3 's father does n't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter 's case released to the public			1
@entity9 's attorneys sent a letter monday to the @entity12 district attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen 's parents			1
only six - years - old at the time of her death , @entity3 was found dead in the basement of her family 's home @entity21 in 1996 after the girl 's mother called 911 saying a ransom note had been left			1
help us find the killer : @entity9 looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife @entity30 touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of @entity3 reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both @entity9 and @entity38 , the deceased girl 's mother			1
@entity9 's attorneys argued monday that to release only the indictments , and not the entire grand jury record , would put him at a disadvantage			1
' public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame ( @entity9 ) and his late wife @entity47 , ' the letter said , according to the @entity48			1
' mr. @entity9 will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law , ' the letter continued			2
beautiful : @entity3 competed in and won several beauty pageants before her murder ' nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view , ' said the letter			2
the move to make the indictments public is an effort between the @entity70 and a @entity48 reporter			0
the indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter 's death , according to the paper			0
a grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges , but the district attorney declined to go forward with the charges over the fear he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt , according to the paper			0
@entity86 : the @entity87 appear at the @entity88 in 2000 to answer questions about their experience with the media from journalism students sent on @entity9 's behalf , the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules , the paper said			1
that judge ordered the current da to provide reason why it should be kept secret , according to the @entity48 , to which the said he would provide them to a judge to determine if they would be released			0
@entity9 's attorneys argued against this move , saying he was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter 's case - adding that without releasing the entire record , the objective will not be achieved			2
' the @entity114 found ' transparency ' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause , ' said the letter			0
' transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public			0
' ' the court should also order release of the entire grand jury record , including all witness testimony , all exhibits , all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury , ' the letter continues			0
officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired , according to the paper			1
the @entity87 were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl 's death by the then - @entity101			0
the statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002 .			2

@entity3 , 6 , was found murdered in her family 's basement on *christmas* day , 1996
the secret indictments reportedly claim both @entity9 and @entity38 abused the girl until she died
@entity9 argues releasing them will defame him and his deceased wife @entity47
the statute of limitations for the charges ran out in 2002
