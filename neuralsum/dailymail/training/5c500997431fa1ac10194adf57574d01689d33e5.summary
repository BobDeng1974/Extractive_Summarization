dozens of conservative mps are urging @entity2 to give @entity3 a veto over all @entity6 laws , in an attempt to take back control of @entity10 ’s borders			1
up to 80 backbenchers are expected to sign a letter to the prime minister calling for @entity3 to be given the right to throw out existing laws from @entity16 and block new ones			1
the mps say the move would allow @entity10 to ‘ recover control over our borders , lift @entity6 burdens on business , ( and ) regain control over energy policy ... in popular and sensible ways			1
’ up to 80 backbenchers are expected to sign the letter calling for the right to throw out existing laws from @entity16 so @entity10 can ' recover control over our borders ' ( file picture ) the letter will pile pressure on mr @entity2 to go further in addressing public concern about @entity6 immigration and interference by @entity16			1
the intervention comes as home secretary @entity36 prepares to release a report floating the idea of capping immigration from the @entity6 at 75,000 a year			0
the @entity41 document , part of a government - wide review of @entity6 laws , suggests a cap could cut net migration from @entity6 countries by 30,000 from the current 106,000 a year			0
but critics said the move would be illegal , unless @entity10 quits the @entity6 – and questioned whether mrs may was trying to burnish her reputation for taking a tough line on immigration			1
former shadow home secretary @entity55 said any action would almost certainly be too late to prevent an influx of migrants from @entity59 and @entity60 when transitional controls are lifted next month			0
home secretary @entity36 is preparing to release a report floating the idea of capping immigration from the @entity6 at 75,000 a year mr @entity55 told the @entity65 ’s @entity64 : ‘ the government is caught because it does n’t want to have a fight with the @entity6 courts and the @entity69 over it , but that ’s where it ’s going			0
‘ @entity36 , the @entity41 , are looking at a variety of policies to try to bring it under control			0
i have to say straight away it ’s a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted			0
’ the @entity80 also suggests blocking @entity6 immigrants from claiming benefits or tax credits for their first five years in the @entity10			1
other plans include giving @entity10 citizens a ‘ national preference ’ by explicitly reserving jobs for them and limiting labour movement from poorer countries			2
@entity92 leader @entity91 accused ministers of ‘ desperate spin ’ adding that the only way to achieve the measures ‘ would be to leave the @entity6 ’			0
a senior @entity97 source described the proposals as ‘ ridiculous ’ , adding : ‘ even the @entity99 do n’t think they can renegotiate to that extreme			0
the amount of @entity10 people it would impact would far outweigh the people they ’re trying to stop , and @entity10 business would be crippled			2
’ the prime minister has responded to mounting public concern about @entity6 immigration with a series of policy proposals in recent weeks , including curbing access to benefits and requiring migrants to speak @entity114			1
but the @entity69 has warned it will take the @entity10 to court if measures breach the @entity6 ’s freedom of movement principle .			2
