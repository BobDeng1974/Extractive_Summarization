i really was n't sure what to expect in @entity2			1
having travelled the world for over 17 years as a model , i 've been fortunate to visit some amazing countries for shoots			1
but @entity2 is a country i had never been to before and , yes , there were nerves considering all the negative publicity @entity2 has been getting since the revolution			1
even my grandmother asked me did i really think it was a good idea to take my son @entity13 ! @entity14 : @entity15 and toddler son @entity13 take a stroll on the sand next to the @entity19 hotel we flew from @entity21 and the flight was an easy five hours			1
we flew on @entity23 , and they are fantastic			2
a bit like the old @entity26 , though , as you are only allowed one piece of carry - on luggage - so we had to check in @entity13 's case			1
but other than that i really enjoyed the flight			1
i love their on - board menu as they have great healthy options and coconut water , which is my travel essential , especially for flying , as it 's great for rehydration			1
when we arrived at the airport it was a little chaotic with lots of men holding boards with people 's names on them			2
this is where flying with a company like @entity49 makes a difference			2
our driver picked us up and put our visas in our passports and immediately made me feel safe and well looked after			1
you need to make sure you have in cash for each visa			2
@entity13 was a little tired and fell asleep in the car on the way to the hotel			1
@entity61 is about 45 minutes from @entity63 airport			1
it was dark when we arrived , but the entrance to the @entity66 was very impressive and beautifully lit. we settled into our room and headed straight for dinner , as we were starving			2
we ate in the @entity70 restaurant and i had the set menu			2
if you are staying full board you do n't need to worry about extra bills at the end of your trip , and i do always recommend this option as costs can creep up otherwise			2
an oasis on the edge of the water : @entity15 and @entity13 spent part of their break at the @entity19 hotel @entity13 was so excited			1
when he saw the pool he was speechless , and wanted to go swimming straight away ( yes in the dark )			2
the next morning at breakfast he did n't even really eat because of the excitement			2
he went to the kids ' club in the @entity66 on the second day and i headed over to the spa			0
the @entity94 is recognised as the best in @entity2 , and one of the largest in the world			1
the @entity98 contains 830 cubic metres of sea water sub-divided into a number of distinct zones - with water jets , currents , counter-currents , showers and bubbling baths			1
each one is designed to provide comfort and to regenerate and tone a specific part of your body			0
it 's amazing for breaking down cellulite and fat - so , needless to say , instead of the recommended 20 seconds when the jets were at my legs and bottom , i took considerably longer			1
the man who was working there quickly understood what i was doing			0
we both burst out laughing			0
in one of the areas i tried , he told me to swim with the current			0
it was an amazing experience , as the current moves you around really fast			0
but then he asked me to walk against the current , and that was tough			0
but he said it 's amazing for your legs			0
i wish we had a @entity134 in @entity135			0
ready for a quick dip : @entity13 prepares for a snorkelling adventure - and a meeting with @entity139 when i got back , @entity13 was smiling from ear to ear , eating pizza and chips in the kids ' club			1
@entity13 loved @entity146 who ran the club			1
they played football and built sandcastles while i relaxed			0
the beach at the @entity66 was out of this world			1
i could n't stop pinching myself as i stared into the crystal clear blue waters			0
@entity13 and i went on adventures , crab hunting - and finding dinosaur bones and teeth ( coral , really )			1
we even found dinosaur tracks ( birds , really ) as @entity13 said they have three toes			1
he was so excited and could n't believe how lucky he was			0
we found a crab and a jellyfish			0
i absolutely love discovering things through a child 's eyes			0
children really make you appreciate the beauty in everything			0
we did a mixture of beach and pool for the rest of our stay at the @entity66			1
@entity13 had his new swim - fin , which gave him great confidence in the water			1
there were a lot of @entity184 there , but i was amazed that the @entity186 and @entity135 have yet to really discover @entity61			1
it 's so close and so beautiful , and it ticks so many boxes			0
if you want a family holiday where you can relax and feel confident that your kids are safe and having fun , @entity61 is ideal			1
we transferred to the @entity19 for the last three days			0
wow , what a welcome			0
we stayed in a hotel within a hotel ! okay , so let me explain			0
there is a club within the @entity19 called the @entity199			0
it has its own restaurant for breakfast and dinner			0
we had an ocean view , which allowed us to see incredibly breathtaking sunsets			0
if you want luxury , you must stay here			1
beautifully designed : @entity15 also stayed at @entity61 's @entity66 , with its extensive swathe of space they even offer a selection of pillows , scented baths and great children 's amenities			1
again , we favoured the beach , as it was simply stunning			2
@entity13 made friends with lots of other kids , and he had a ball while i relaxed watching him			1
@entity13 had the biggest bubble baths ever			1
the bath looks out to the ocean and @entity13 said to me ' mum i can see how beautiful the sky looks from here '			1
he passed out most evenings very early , so i used to sit on the balcony reading a book			0
the kids ' club in the @entity19 was fantastic			0
they offer a full daily schedule , and you can drop the kids off and pick them up at your leisure			0
when they were down at the beach @entity13 joined in , or joined them for a movie in the afternoon			1
but as he 's my buddy and i 'm also a child we played on the beach and built sandcastles most of the day			2
our final couple of days were full of adventures			0
@entity13 went snorkelling right out in the ocean			1
i could n't believe it			0
it was quite windy but the instructor was amazing			0
at one stage i thought @entity13 was panicking , but he was trying to get his snorkel out of his mouth to inform me he had seen @entity139 and also @entity254 ... but she probably would n't remember			1
water features : there are plenty of pools for splashing , and sunloungers for a few hours ' relaxation we also rode on camels and went on a glass - bottomed boat			2
it was so much fun			0
there are also lots of day trips you can take to @entity270 and even @entity271 , but we stayed put as i needed a rest			0
for a winter sun break @entity61 really is perfect			1
a five - hour flight and you are in paradise			2
the water is crystal clear and the beaches have the most beautiful white sand i have ever seen			0
the one thing i noticed is that , although these are big hotels , they do n't feel overcrowded			0
everything is very well designed , and even on the beach you have great space between the seats			2
everywhere is very family - friendly , and no matter what your interest , as a family , everyone will be happy			2
if you are sporty , a diver , a golfer - or if you want to visit one of the leading spas in the world or simply chill out and relax , you can do it all in @entity61			1
