the chalet ski holiday is a quirk of @entity3 culture - and my goodness , it 's a survivor			1
most civilised countries think being cooped up in a poky wooden house with eight or ten others , sometimes sharing bathrooms and eating food cooked by gap - year students , has all the ingredients of a ghastly tv reality show			2
but as a nation , we ca n't get enough of it			0
a hideaway on the edge of the slopes : @entity21 is perfectly positioned for skiing in @entity23 yes , things can go wrong ( i remember coming down early one morning and seeing a young man rushing up from the basement where the chalet girls stayed			1
" sorry , forgot my trousers , " he said			0
) but standards have risen greatly since the @entity32 when @entity33 pioneered this kind of holiday with the help of his @entity38 ' @entity37 '			0
@entity39 has been in the game more than ten years and operates in the ski world 's @entity42 - @entity41 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
it 's a super-efficient and flexible company			0
come on in , the fire 's lit : the chalet has a cosy atmosphere in its main lounge space if you want only three or four dinners in the chalet , rather than six , that 's fine ( the price is adjusted accordingly ) and if you book ski and boot hire in advance , a man appears on your first evening with all the clobber			1
we opted for chalet @entity21 in @entity23 , where eight of us snuggled down in four double rooms , all with en - suite bathrooms			1
chalet girls @entity70 and @entity72 , who had been at school together , were charming and rustled up simple , but delicious , food ( freshly baked cakes for tea ) and the selection of wines ( included at no extra cost ) was greatly appreciated			1
a lot has been said about the @entity83 invasion of @entity84 , the next valley along from 1650 - and it 's all true , with @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 et al setting up shops beside the piste			1
a space to relax away from the slopes : the chalet has space for eight people in four double rooms but @entity98 is a different world entirely , with a few simple bars and restaurants , one or two hotels and lots of chalets on the hill			1
what 's admirably swanky , however , are the escalators that save you walking long distances with your gear to and from the main bubble lift up the mountain			0
the @entity113 ( @entity47 , @entity46 , @entity114 ) is such a large area it 's worth spending a day or even half day with a reputable ski guiding company			1
we chose @entity120 and not one , but two , qualified ski instructors arrived - the boss @entity124 and colleague @entity123			2
they skied with effortless style and were good company , too			0
while lots of people make for the dizzy heights of @entity114 , we tended to ski mainly in 1650 and then found some superbly uncrowded runs through trees down to @entity132 and @entity133			1
the challenge most days was to find places to eat on the mountain that were accessible to non-skiers such as my wife , for whom even sitting upstairs on a double - decker bus is something of a vertigo challenge			2
out on the terrace : the chalet offers the opportunity for @entity146 - if you feel it 's warm enough this proved remarkably easy			2
@entity150 , at the top of the @entity153 bubble lift , has a gorgeous balcony and the food is top - notch without charging @entity83 prices ; the newly opened @entity158 restaurant in 1850 is another good option if you 're happy with a fancy burger and there 's a decent and lively restaurant at the top of the @entity133 bubble			0
sadly we could not get to my favourite , @entity166 , where the @entity169 family has been in business more than 25 years			0
on the chalet girls ' day off , the younger members of our group enjoyed a fondue at @entity176 , while my wife and i checked out 1850 's newest hotel , @entity179			2
my goodness , it 's plush			0
stay here and your skis are put out for you in the morning and there is even a small drag lift so you do n't have to walk uphill for all of 20 yards			0
a mountain marvel : @entity47 is one of the most fabled ski resorts in the @entity192 @entity191 life was a little more simple back in our chalet - and a lot more @entity3			1
@entity197 ( 020 8877 8888 , www.powderwhite.com ) offers seven - nights at @entity198 in @entity23 from £ 349pp , including breakfast , tea , dinner and unlimited wine			1
@entity203 ( www.easyjet.com ) flies from @entity204 to @entity205 from £ 52.29 return			0
book car hire through www.carrentals.co.uk , and ski instruction with @entity210			2
meet and @entity212 parking is available through @entity213 .			0

chalet @entity21 sits in the fabled @entity192 ski resort of @entity23
@entity47 1650 tends to be a more *affordable* area than @entity84
@entity21 has a cosy ambience , *sleeping* up to eight in four double rooms
