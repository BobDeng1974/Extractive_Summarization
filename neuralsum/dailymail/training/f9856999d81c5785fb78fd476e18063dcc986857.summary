@entity0 celebrated his 28th birthday on monday by declaring himself so much a better fighter than he was a year ago that he is now the future of boxing			1
if he can demonstrate that to the world with a statement performance against @entity9 ’s @entity8 here on the @entity11 on saturday night , he hopes the public will give him the present he wants above all others			1
namely , that long awaited fight with @entity16			1
birthday boy @entity0 says he 's the future of boxing ahead of his clash with @entity8 @entity0 was speaking to reporters at @entity20 in @entity11 ahead of the big fight on saturday night @entity0 ( left ) with @entity8 ( right ) pose ahead of their fight alongside @entity24 ( centre ) @entity0 hopes victory over @entity8 in @entity11 can propel him into a fight with @entity16 ‘ i ’m focussed on @entity8 , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ but after i beat him i hope the people will say that i deserve to fight @entity16 and will demand that he meets me			1
’ that picture is clouded by the public ’s desire to see @entity16 meet @entity33 in the richest fight of all time			1
but if that does n’t happen @entity0 expects to be ready and waiting for the fight of his life			1
he says : ‘ i have the fastest hands in the ring			0
i have some of the best skills in boxing			2
i deserve to be regarded as among the elite fighters in the world , to be talked about in the same breath as @entity16 and @entity33			1
i believe i am the future of boxing			1
’ the boy from @entity50 has never been short of confidence , even after twice losing world title defences , but his detractors are wrong in confusing that self - belief with arrogance			0
this is the first time @entity0 has pronounced himself the equal of the two men widely regarded as the best pound - for - pound fighters on the planet			2
he does so in the certainty that he has eliminated the mistakes which saw him walk on to devastating punches and now knows how to protect a chin which many regard as made of glass			0
@entity16 ( left ) has yet to decide who he will face when he returns to the ring next may @entity16 outpointed @entity68 in their september rematch to extend his unbeaten record he explains : ‘ even though i ’m just turning 28 i still feel young , i ’m still hungry and still a nice person			2
but the difference is that i ’m wiser , smarter and i 've learned from those mistakes			0
’ @entity0 should have fought @entity8 a year ago , when the 27 - year - old from @entity76 held a world title			1
he pulled out in anticipation of a @entity16 fight and @entity8 lost that crown to @entity81 , who subsequently had it taken from him by @entity0 ’s @entity84 rival @entity83			1
but @entity0 does not regret starting that chain of events			2
he says : ‘ everything happens for a reason and i know now that i ’m a stronger , smarter fighter than i was 12 months ago			0
@entity0 was top of the table as he spoke to boxing journalists in @entity91 to cover the @entity8 fight there 's no escaping the @entity0 vs @entity8 fight as huge billboard posters fill the lobby of the @entity96 ‘ that would have been my first fight coming up to welterweight and there ’s no doubt that i ’m much more ready for @entity102 now than i would have been then			1
‘ i 've grown into the division			0
and in the time i had out of the ring @entity106 ( his trainer ) corrected my errors			1
he worked on my balance and my defence			0
he made me realise that although i ’m an attacking boxer i need to recognise when to go on the offensive			0
‘ it ’s in my blood to love a fight and that will always be a big part of me			0
but i have a better grasp of when to concentrate on boxing with abilities and not walk onto big shots			0
anyone who does that gets knocked down by the kind of punches i got caught with			0
‘ now i know that this is my time			0
’ @entity0 made an impressive debut at welterweight with a comfortable points win over @entity129 last may @entity0 lands a right hand on @entity131 during a dominant performance in which he showed vast improvements this is his first fight since the birth of his first child and he has spent most of the time since that day away from his daughter , his wife and most of his family at @entity142 gym near @entity143			1
he says : ‘ i ’ve sparred more than 160 rounds			0
i ’ve learned to eat clean because if you put high quality fuel in a racing car it goes even faster			0
i ’ve missed my family			0
but i ’m making the sacrifices because i want the big fights against the best in the world , the chance to prove i belong in the ring with them and see how well i can do			0
’ @entity0 ’s father and mentor , @entity160 , does spend time with him at the training camp			2
his separation from his mother ended , for a few hours on his birthday , as she welcomed him and his father to @entity11 as they flew in from @entity143			2
his eyes light up when he says : ‘ i ’ll be flying to @entity169 the day after this fight to see my wife and daughter and spend quality time with them over the holidays			0
’ he expects to make that trip as a hot contender in what is being described here as ‘ the @entity16 sweepstakes '			2
that will depend on him defeating @entity8 , another quick and clever boxer , in eye - catching style on his first bill - topping appearance at the fabled @entity96			2
@entity0 vs @entity8 will be televised live on @entity184 late saturday night			1
@entity0 believes he has improved considerably under the tutelage of trainer @entity106 @entity0 will fly to @entity169 after the fight to be with his wife @entity187 ( right ) and baby daughter			1
