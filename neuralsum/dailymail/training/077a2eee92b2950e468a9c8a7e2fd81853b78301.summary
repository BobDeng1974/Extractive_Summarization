@entity1 prosecutors said tuesday that dna tests could not identify the charred remains that might be those of 42 missing college students			1
an @entity7 forensics lab was unable to find any more dna that could be used by conventional means to identify them , but said they have authorized a final , unconventional effort			1
the attorney general 's office said the @entity13 reported that ' excessive heat ' damaged the mitochondrial dna in fragments of teeth and bones , ' at least to the point that normal methods can not be used to successfully analyze them			1
' failure to positively identify the remains would be a setback for the government , which has struggled with widespread , often violent protests demanding that the students be returned alive , and with relatives ' skepticism about the official belief they are dead			1
the shadow of a demonstrator is cast on a wall with graffiti protesting the disappearance of 43 rural college students , in front of the @entity1 attorney general 's office , in @entity39 the @entity13 had previously found @entity8 in the remains that belonged to one of the 43 students who were detained and disappeared in the southern state of @entity44 in september			1
prosecutors say the students were turned over to a drug gang that killed them and then incinerated their bodies on a fuel - fed pyre , before crushing the charred remains and them in a river			1
authorities sent only 16 sets of remains to @entity7 , saying the rest were so badly deteriorated there was no chance of identifying them			1
the university has offered to use one last technique to identify the remains , but says there is a risk the testing may destroy the samples without obtaining any useful information			2
that technique is known as massively parallel sequencing , which uses many computers in coordination to perform a task			0
the university said it expected the testing to take another three months , but could not give an exact date for results			2
' the main risk is that the dna extracted may be destroyed ' without yielding any usable results , prosecutors cited the university as saying			2
demonstrators clash with police during a protest in demand of justice and clarification for the disappearance of 43 students from @entity89 , in @entity90 , on monday prosecutors said , however , they had authorized the new round of testing			0
@entity93 , a lawyer representing families of the missing teachers college students , said prosecutors should have consulted the families of the missing students before making that decision			0
' if these tests are done on the bone fragments , there could be practically nothing left , ' @entity93 told local media			0
' this is going to have an impact on the parents ' belief system			0
... in rural tradition , mourning is highly symbolic , highly important			0
' the students went missing sept. 26 after confrontations with police in the @entity44 state city of @entity114 in which three students and three bystanders were killed			1
