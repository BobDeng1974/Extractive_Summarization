' as well as all the victims of these appalling crimes , the families of both of these men are victims as well			0
' their families have been completely betrayed by the horrendous activity that both of these men have been undergoing			0
' their crimes are absolutely despicable			0
they 've preyed on vulnerable young boys who have every right , in this day and age , to be able to experiment and use the internet			0
' and especially young boys who are perhaps confused about their sexuality , it should be perhaps a safe environment for them to be able to experiment and explore online			0
' however , both of these men - obviously vastly older than all of the child victims - have gained their trust , have preyed on that vulnerability and groomed them entirely for the purpose of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse			1
' and they 've actually gone on to meet the young boys in whatever setting that may have been and committed vile , horrendous offences against them			2
' life sentence : @entity102 will be sentenced at @entity32 , pictured , tomorrow ms @entity55 said : ' this abuse has been continuing for a long time			0

@entity11 believe there could be other young men out there who are victims of @entity0 and @entity2 and in need of help and support			1
ms @entity55 said : ' that 's definitely a possibility , unfortunately , purely because of the amount of time these men have been offending against young boys and because they have spent such an extraordinarily large amount of time online , grooming young boys			0
' i 've obviously made every effort to prioritise identifying any possible child victims but because of the scale of the offending , clearly there will be some young boys out there that unfortunately we have n't as yet been able to identify			0
if there are any young boys who have been offended against by these two i would urge them to come forward			0
