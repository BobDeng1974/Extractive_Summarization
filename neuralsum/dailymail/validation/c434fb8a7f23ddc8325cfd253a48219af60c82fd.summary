a @entity1 attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life , in a case that echoes that of @entity10			1
terminal : @entity12 , 46 , is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity @entity12 , a former police officer , says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against @entity19 lung adenocarcinoma , which has masticated into a golf ball - sized tumor in her brain			1
despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last june , the 46 - year - old has been told her death will be painful , as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her			1
' i think it 's a terrible injustice that i do n't have the choice to die in the manner i want to and instead that i 'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and i might even die alone , ' @entity12 told @entity34 in a new feature			1
@entity12 is now using what time she has left to support a death with @entity39 law in @entity40 , having been inspired by @entity41 , the 29 - year - old @entity40 woman who moved to @entity43 to take her own life last year , ending a long battle with brain cancer			1
@entity12 says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in @entity50 , with her 20 - year - old daughter , @entity51 , holding her hand			1
she says her greatest fear is that her daughter will come home one day and find her mother dead			0
@entity12 said she went to the doctors last year after waking up one morning and not being able to read properly			2
a big book worm , she had been reading before going to bed the night before , only to wake and hardly make out the letters of some words			0
she had her eyes checked , but the results came back fine			0
@entity12 then called her physician and explain what happened , and the doctor told her to immediately go to the emergency room			2
legacy : @entity10 , 29 , moved from @entity40 to @entity43 - one of five @entity69 states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in november an mri and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis			1
' @entity51 grabbed my hand and i just started crying and said , '' i 'm so sorry '' , ' @entity12 told people			2
' what i was really saying was , '' i 'm so sorry i 'm going to die and leave you without a mom ''			0
' @entity12 underwent chemotherapy and has taken part in numerous clinical trials			2
however her prognosis has not changed			0
' there is not anything medically we have not explored , ' @entity12 said			2
' so it is not like i have n't exhausted all my options			0
my opinion is an informed one			0
' doctors say the tumor in @entity12 's lungs causes fluid to build up			1
she will soon have to undergo a painful procedure to empty the fluid , however it will fill up again almost immediately			0
' there 's a good likelihood ( my daughter ) will come home from work , come home from school , and find me dead , ' an overwhelmed @entity12 told @entity106			2
in memoriam : three @entity40 lawmakers are promoting right - to - die legislation with the family of @entity10 ( pictured with husband @entity111 ) , a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under @entity43 law on november 1 love : @entity10 and @entity111 married at the @entity115 in @entity40 's wine country on september 29 , 2012 @entity12 is now hoping to fight not just to stay alive until @entity10 's 21st birthday in june , but for the law to allow her to die the way she wants			1
' in the short amount of time i have left , i want to spend it with my daughter - she and i are doing this together - and i want to speak out in whatever way possible to start that dialogue with the public , with the legislature and the courts , and try and impact change , ' @entity12 said			2
@entity12 's case is incredible similar to that of @entity41			1
her family - lead by mother @entity135 - are now trying to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in @entity40 with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor			1
the practice is legal in five states , including @entity43 , where @entity41 moved before her suicide on november 1			1
hoping for change : @entity135 , the mother of @entity10 , speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on wednesday january 21 , 2015 , in @entity151 the 29 - year - old @entity153 woman had made her case public with online videos , saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life - ending drugs in @entity40			1
' most californians would not be able to do what we did , ' @entity135 said			0
' they could n't leave their homes ; they could n't leave their jobs ; they could n't leave their families , their friends , their pets			0
' we had to do all of that			0
it added another layer of pain			0
' @entity41 wrote in her final @entity172 post : " goodbye to all my dear friends and family that i love			0
today is the day i have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness , this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more			0
