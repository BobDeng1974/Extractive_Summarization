by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the same federal scientist who recently found forgotten samples of smallpox at a federal lab also uncovered over 300 additional vials , many bearing the names of highly contagious viruses and bacteria			1
@entity12 officials said wednesday the undocumented collection contained 327 carefully packaged vials , listing pathogens like dengue , influenza and rickettsia			1
last week the government only disclosed that it had recovered six glass vials of smallpox dating from the 1950s			0
forgotten : forgotten viles of various diseases and bacterias have been discovered in storage at the @entity26 the new revelations raise serious concerns about the government 's ability to secure its collections of potentially deadly pathogens			1
' the reasons why these samples went unnoticed for this long is something we 're actively trying to understand , ' said @entity12 deputy director for biologics dr. @entity40			2
the samples , including those labeled smallpox , were found in 12 boxes in a corner of a cold storage room at the @entity26 in @entity47 , @entity48 , that has been used by the @entity12 since 1972			1
@entity12 officials estimate the collection was assembled between 1946 and 1964 by government scientists			2
' the fact that these materials were not discovered until now is unacceptable , ' said @entity54 , of @entity12 's director for biologics			2
' however , upon finding these materials our staff did the right thing â€” they immediately notified the appropriate authorities who secured the materials and determined there was no exposure			0
' smallpox : this 1975 file electronmicrograph from the @entity69 shows the smallpox virus @entity12 scientists said they have not yet confirmed whether the newly disclosed vials actually contained the pathogens listed on their labels			1
the agency is conducting a nationwide search of all cold storage units for any other missing samples			0
investigators destroyed 32 vials containing tissue samples and a non-contagious virus related to smallpox			2
several unlabeled vials were sent to the @entity69 for testing and the remaining 279 samples were shipped to the @entity86 for safekeeping			0
@entity12 officials said there is no evidence anyone was exposed to any of the agents , which were packed in heat - sealed glass vials with no signs of leakage			1
the finding of freeze - dried smallpox samples was disturbing because smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 , and world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in @entity101 and in @entity102			1
investigation : the @entity69 , pictured , and the @entity104 are investigating the six vials of smallpox found in a storage room it was the second recent incident in which a @entity110 government health agency appeared to have mishandled a highly dangerous biologic agent			1
last month , scores of employees at the @entity69 in @entity101 were feared exposed to anthrax because of a laboratory safety lapse			0
the @entity69 began giving them antibiotics as a precaution			0
in separate congressional testimony wednesday , @entity69 director dr. @entity119 acknowledged that systemic safety problems have for years plagued federal public health laboratories that handle dangerous germs such as anthrax and bird flu			0
@entity119 added that his agency had long thought of the lapses as unrelated accidents .			0

the freeze - dried samples were found in a *building* at the @entity26 in @entity47 , @entity48 , that has been used by the @entity12 since 1972
the vials were *intact* and sealed , and scientists have yet to establish whether the viruses are dead or alive
on *july* 1 , a scientist was *cleaning* out a cold room between two laboratories at the same *facility* when he discovered viles of smallpox
the find was disturbing because for decades after smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 , world health authorities said the only known samples left were safely stored in super-secure laboratories in @entity101 and in @entity102
