on the outside , the metal box looks like an oversized bread container			1
but what 's inside could save an abandoned newborn 's life			1
the box is actually a newborn incubator , or baby box , and it could be showing up soon at @entity10 hospitals , fire stations , churches and selected nonprofits under legislation that would give mothers in crisis a way to surrender their children safely and anonymously			1
@entity10 could be the first state to allow use of the baby boxes on a broad scale to prevent dangerous abandonments of infants if the bill , which unanimously passed the @entity25 this week , clears the state @entity26			1
@entity29 state rep. @entity28 and child - safety advocates say they 're unaware of any other states that have considered the issue at the level @entity10 has			1
safe haven : @entity35 , firefighter and medic who is president of @entity37 poses with a prototype of a baby box , where parents could surrender their newborns anonymously @entity28 says his bill is a natural progression of the ' safe haven ' laws that exist in all 50 states and the @entity47			1
those give parents a legal way to surrender newborns at hospitals , police stations and other facilities without fear of prosecution so long as the child has n't been harmed			0
many children , however , never make it that far			0
@entity59 , president of the @entity60 the @entity61 in @entity62 , said safe haven laws have resulted in more than 2,800 safe surrenders since 1999			2
but more than 1,400 other children have been found illegally abandoned , nearly two - thirds of whom died			2
@entity28 said his proposal draws on a centuries - old concept to help ' those children that are left in the woods , those children that are abandoned in dangerous places			2
' baby boxes , known in some countries as baby hatches or angel cradles , originated in medieval times , when convents were equipped with revolving doors known as ' foundling wheels			2
' choice : parents can leave children at @entity10 fire stations where they will be safely placed with new homes unwanted infants were placed in compartments in the doors , which were then rotated to get the infant inside			1
hundreds of children have been surrendered in modern - day versions in place in @entity95 and @entity96			0
the devices are even the subject of a new documentary titled ' @entity100 , ' which chronicles the efforts of a pastor in @entity103 , @entity104 , to address child abandonment			0
supporters contend the boxes can save lives by offering women who ca n't face relinquishing a child in person a safe and anonymous alternative to abandonment or infanticide			1
but critics say the boxes make it easier to abandon a child without exploring other options and contend they do nothing to address poverty and other societal issues that contribute to unwanted babies			0
expect them soon : these boxes could be showing up at hospitals , fire stations , churches and other selected sites under legislation that would give mothers in crisis a way to surrender their children safely some baby hatches in @entity133 have been so overwhelmed by abandonments in recent years that local officials have restricted their use or closed them			1
the @entity137 has called for a ban on the boxes in @entity95 and has urged countries to provide family planning and other support to address the root causes of abandonments , according to spokeswoman @entity144			0
whether the @entity145 is ready for the boxes is a matter of debate			0
@entity59 said many parents who surrender their children at safe haven sites need medical care that they wo n't get if they leave the baby in a box			1
handing the child to a trained professional also provides an opportunity to determine whether the mother simply needs financial support or other help to develop a parenting plan			0
' if you use a baby box , you have stripped away that option , ' @entity59 said			1
do n't abandon baby : mothers should not abandon their newborns dangerously and can instead leave them in a baby box where they will be safe ' there 's a lot of things that need to be done to improve safe haven laws throughout the country , but that 's not one of them			1
' a better approach , she said , is for states to spend more money to promote their existing laws			0
@entity35 , a @entity180 , @entity10 , firefighter and medic who is president of @entity182 , said the boxes are n't meant to circumvent the laws that already exist			1
instead , they 're part of a broader approach that includes increasing awareness about the laws and other options available to new mothers in crisis			0
' if these boxes are the answer , great , ' she said			0
' we 're trying to come at it from all angles			0
' @entity35 , who was abandoned in a hospital shortly after her birth because her mother 's pregnancy was the result of rape , suggested the boxes to @entity28 and has formed a nonprofit that is working with a @entity206 , @entity10 , company to develop a prototype			1
holes to breath : the boxes are safe for children and have holes so that they can breathe properly it would be about 2 feet long and be equipped with heating or cooling pads and sensors that would set off alarms when the box is opened and again when a weight is detected inside			1
the boxes also would include a silent alarm that mothers could activate themselves by pushing a button			0
' we 're giving her the power to do what 's right , ' @entity35 said			2
' we 're hoping that these girls know that once they push that button , their baby will be saved			2
' she stressed that the boxes should be viewed as a ' last resort ' and would include a toll - free number staffed 24 hours a day by a counselor who would first ask the caller to surrender the baby to a person			2
the state health department would regulate the boxes			0
@entity28 's bill , which covers children up to 31 days old , also would create a public registry listing box locations			2
@entity35 said the bill expands safe haven locations to include churches and established nonprofits that deal with child - welfare issues to ensure that everyone has access			0
' we want these locations to be able to accept a child if somebody ... thinks this is the only thing they can do , ' she said .			0
