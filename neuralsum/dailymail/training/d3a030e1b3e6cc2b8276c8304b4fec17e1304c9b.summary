by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 09:26 est , 31 august 2012 zombies			1
they 're the ' thing ' these days , are n't they ? movies , tv , video games			2
the walking dead are everywhere			2
it 's no surprise , then , that many modern - day zombie offerings lack that killer suspense ... after all , we 've all seen it all and played it all before , right ? wrong			1
because that 's where @entity14 comes in - a revolutionary first - person horror game built from the ground up to take full advantage of the @entity20 's @entity19			2
@entity21 is plagued with zombies and survivors are few and far between			1
your job is to stay alive for as long as possible			0
dead good : the zombies are smart and will attack in packs if you 're too noisy and thanks to the @entity30 controls , staying alive has never felt , well , more alive			1
it acts as a number of things			0
first and foremost it 's your satchel			0
with a click of a button the game zooms out from first person and you use @entity30 's screen to equip / use items			1
this works brilliantly as it forces you to take your eyes away from the main tv screen - giving you a sense of vulnerability never before experienced in games of this nature			0
of course , zombies can still attack you while you check your supplies			1
the controller also acts as a lock pick and an infrared scanner			1
with the scanner , you can use the @entity19 to scope out a room - any objects of interest appearing highlighted			1
what 's scary is that if there is a ghost in the room ( yes , there are ghosts , too ) your scanner reading goes all fuzzy			1
one boss battle was so scary , in fact , that i had to stop playing - much to one of the developer 's amusement			0
another cool touch is that when you die , your character turns into a zombie and you take control of another survivor			1
if you run into your old character - you can kill it and get back all your ammo			0
this feature is set to play a big part in the game 's online multiplayer component			0
graphically , it 's not a huge step up from current gen. there 's a silkiness to the visuals that both @entity93 and @entity94 do n't have , but textures and lighting seem very similar indeed			1
@entity98 land : you 'll have to survive @entity21 , like you 've never seen it before zombies look fantastic and charge at you unpredictably			2
they all look different , too			0
which makes a change from the ' i just killed that guy ... again ! why wo n't you die ! ' feeling so often associated with so many games of the genre			2
they 're also very clever ( for the undead , anyway )			0
they will scramble over desks and burst through doors to get at you			0
plus , their behaviour will be directly influenced by how you approach combat			0
go in all - guns - blazing and it will attract more zombies to your location			2
with that in mind , there are some points where you 'll just want to use melee weapons - an axe - for example , to take them down with minimum of noise			0
with games like this , there 's always going to be a controversial twist			2
@entity14 's ' shock factor ' is that one of the levels reportedly sees you killing the undead inside @entity136			1
so , is it looking like the title worth buying a @entity20 for ? a dead cert. follow @entity0 on @entity139 : mooseygamer and on @entity140 : @entity141 .			0

@entity30 controller to look through your *bag* , pick locks and use scanner
when you die , you die ! ( and turn into a zombie )
reportedly features controversial level battling zombies inside @entity136
graphics on the same level as current gen
