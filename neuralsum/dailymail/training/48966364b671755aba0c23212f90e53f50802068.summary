by @entity0 published : 06:54 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 18:19 est , 4 july 2012 it manages just six miles to the gallon and has a top speed of only 60mph			0
but this 100 - year - old @entity5 has zoomed into the world record books , selling at auction for almost £ 5million following a fierce bidding war			2
it was originally bought for £ 1,000 in 1912 ( almost £ 93,000 in today ’s money ) but has now gone under the hammer for £ 4,705,500 , making it the most expensive @entity5 ever sold at auction			1
unique : this 100 - year - old @entity15 has sold for a world - record price of £ 5million after a furious budding war at @entity18 through the roof : the lengthy auction saw two enthusiasts duelling for the pristine car as the bidding went up in increments of £ 100,000 , smashing past the £ 2million estimate in great nick : the six - cylinder , 7.3 - litre car comes with perfect provenance and is still purring smoothly , doing about 15 miles to the gallon what it lacks in gadgetry , the @entity31 - made classic more than compensates for with an extraordinary level of luxury that leaves its modern - day counterparts looking a little unsophisticated			1
its gleaming interior fittings are made of silver and ivory , while the door panels are embroidered silk , with brocade tassels attached to silk window shades for privacy			0
the passenger footrest hides a full picnic set for four , a china tea service , complete with an alcohol - fuelled burner and kettle to heat the water , and a set of six decanters – three in sterling silver and three in leather - wrapped glass			2
the sale took place at the @entity59 in @entity60 on friday			2
auctioneers had expected it to sell for around £ 2million and were astonished when the bidding between two rival collectors topped £ 4million			2
@entity64 , from @entity18 auctioneers , said : ‘ there were three bidders , then one of them dropped out at £ 2.3million and we thought it would end there			1
traveling in style : the design chosen by its original owner echoed the luxurious ' @entity76 carriages pioneered by @entity78 @entity77 luxurious : the elegant passenger compartment ( left ) complete with 29 bevelled glass windows and ( right ) the stylish steering wheel ‘ but then another bidder entered and the bidders were duelling			0
it went up in increments of £ 50,000 , and then £ 100,000 , and then back down to £ 50,000			1
‘ it went on and on and on and was the longest car sale i have ever witnessed			0
everyone was very respectful but when the price reached a milestone , like £ 3million , there was an intake of breath			2
‘ the bidders were duelling and when the hammer came down there was spontaneous applause			0
‘ it was fitting because the car is celebrating her centenary			0
’ the car was commissioned by @entity5 connoisseur @entity104 , who also bought the first @entity15 the luxury car - maker produced in 1906			1
the body was built by former royal carriage - maker @entity107 , which had previously built coaches for @entity110 and @entity112 @entity111			2
standing the test of time : the 7.3 - litre , six - cylinder engine is still purring smoothly and is capable of doing around 15 miles to the gallon mark of history : a plaque bearing the vehicle 's chassis number of 1907 touch of class : the original owner employed the services of the best coach - making company , @entity125 , to do the bodywork classic designs : one of the car 's brake lights			1
the @entity5 still had its headlights , carriage lights , rear lights and inflatable tyres when it went up for sale miniature version : the @entity138 toy of the roller , pictured , is a very accurate copy of the real @entity5			1
the real car was sold by @entity18 at the @entity59 unlike most car enthusiasts of his time , mr @entity104 , from @entity145 , @entity146 , asked the makers not to include a glass division window between the driver and the passengers as he wanted to drive it himself rather than rely on a chauffeur			1
the car even had an early speedometer – an important addition given that a 20mph speed limit was introduced in 1912			0
the car ’s distinctive cream and green design echoed the luxury ‘ pullman ’ railway carriages of the time , and it was known as a @entity162			0
but it was nicknamed ‘ the @entity168 ’ in the 1960s after the toy - maker based its @entity5 toy car on this model			1
mr @entity104 ’s car is believed to be the only one of its kind to survive with its full interior and bodywork , as many @entity175 from the era were converted into ambulances during the @entity178			0
@entity18 said : ‘ it is a statement of refinement , grace and gentility that for many defines the qualities and the edwardian period in which @entity5 established the unsurpassed reputation it still enjoys today			2
’ the identity of the anonymous telephone bidders has not been revealed but sadly @entity18 has confirmed the car will now be leaving @entity31 once more			1
it left @entity31 in 1992 after it was bought by a @entity78 enthusiast			0
a @entity192 lawyer bought it from him in 2007 for £ 1.9million and kept it until 2009 , when he was killed in a crash in a different car			1
the @entity5 was then sold once again before the latest seven - hour auction , which saw more than 80 cars go under the hammer for a combined £ 22million			1
astonishingly , the @entity5 was not the most expensive lot			0
that honour went to a 1929 ‘ @entity206 ’ @entity202 single - seater racing car , which sold for £ 5,042,000 , the highest price ever for a @entity31 car at auction			1
in 1932 , fighter pilot and @entity209 winner sir @entity207 set a 137mph speed record in the @entity202 , described as the @entity211 of its time			0
