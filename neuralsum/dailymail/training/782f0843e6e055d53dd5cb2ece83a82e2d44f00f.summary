@entity2 , a rare african pygmy hedgehog , was no longer wanted but luckily he was taken in by @entity8 animal rescue centre in @entity9			1
but with his pure white spikes and bright red eyes , it was unclear what the centre ’s resident black and white @entity14 pygmy , called @entity16 , would make of the new arrival			2
@entity2 , the rare albino african pygmy hedgehog , has befriended @entity16 , the black and white @entity14 pygmy @entity2 , who weighs less than 500oz , was given away to the rescue centre by owners who no longer wanted him but thankfully the two have proved that opposites do attract and they have now become best friends			1
park owner @entity26 said : ' @entity2 and @entity16 really are sweet - they love to burrow together and they change their house around all the time to get themselves comfortable			2
' they ’re very active and very sweet			0
' @entity2 and @entity16 have been given special permission to live in mrs @entity26 ’s home as they have to be kept in warm conditions			2
mrs @entity26 added : ' these hedgehogs ave to be kept in warm temperatures so they live with us in our house			0
@entity16 and @entity2 will join owls , a skunk , snakes , a leopard ghekko and other exotic creatures for a special public viewing at @entity42 ' you have to have heating on all the time for @entity45			1
you ca n’t just turn it off when you go to bed because they will die			0
' people buy these pets on impulse , but five minutes later they do n’t want them - they do n’t realise the amount of care that is needed			0
' @entity14 pygmys are small and do n’t hibernate because @entity14 is warm and they do n’t have the body fat to survive			0
' @entity16 and @entity2 will join owls , a skunk , snakes , a leopard ghekko and other exotic creatures for a special public viewing on @entity62 and monday			1
the tourist attraction found it could only showcase wild and exotic animals not native to the @entity65 seven days of the year , after officials at @entity67 realised the centre did not have a zoo licence .			0

@entity2 *'s* owners no longer wanted him so he was taken in by animal rescue
