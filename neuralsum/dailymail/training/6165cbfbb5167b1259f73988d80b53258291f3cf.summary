by @entity0 published : 12:17 est , 28 february 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 28 february 2013 a baby has cheated death after she was randomly chosen to have a new blood test			1
five - month - old @entity4 was one of 430,000 babies chosen by doctors at @entity7 to be screened for five serious conditions			1
the test showed that @entity10 has the rare metabolic condition , @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , which causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood			1
as soon as the results came in the seriously ill baby was rushed to hospital , where they discovered she was just hours from death			1
@entity4 ( pictured with her mother , @entity22 ) was diagnosed with @entity12 when she was just hours from death her mother , @entity24 , said : ‘ it was a big shock to begin with			1
the nurses called me on the phone and then a few minutes later they were at the door			0
‘ they called an ambulance straight away to take @entity10 into hospital			0
at this point she was n't crying , she was lethargic and already in a coma - like state			0
’ mrs @entity4 , who lives in @entity34 , had a normal pregnancy and only realised there was something wrong when her daughter did not settle like normal babies			1
@entity12 is so rare , and symptoms are initially so broad , that any number of ailments could have been causing the symptoms			1
‘ she was trying to cry but she was n't able to			0
we did n't know what to do , ’ said mrs @entity4			1
however , the child was saved because she took part in the newborn screening just six days after she was born			2
two days later , when @entity51 was eight - days - old , the results came back showing that she had @entity12 , a genetic disorder which stops the body breaking down parts of proteins called amino acids			1
the test identified high levels of the amino acid leucine in @entity10 ’s blood , a condition which can lead to coma , brain damage and death if not treated			1
sheer luck : @entity51 was only diagnosed because she was selected for a screening programme at @entity7			1
( pictured here with consultant dr @entity68 , left , and head of dietetic services @entity69 , right			0
) mrs @entity4 , 30 , said : ' she was a very lucky girl			1
she had to be taken straight to the @entity72			0
’ @entity51 was put on dialysis to cleanse her blood and then began special feeds given via a feeding pump			2
after just 48 hours she came out of the coma - like state and could cry normally			2
she is now being fed low - leucine feeds made up by her mother who has received special training on how to feed her daughter correctly			0
@entity12 is an inherited metabolic disorder which is caused by a mutation in at least four genes			1
it causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood			1
if untreated it causes brain damage , physical disabilities and death			1
globally it affects about 1 in every 185,000 live births			0
symptoms include maple syrup smelling urine and earwax , poor feeding , vomiting , poor weight gain , lethargy and seizures			0
it is managed through a carefully controlled diet which is low in the amino acid leucine			0
the only other treatment is liver transplant			0
as she grows up @entity10 will need to have a very low protein diet avoiding eggs , fish and meats amongst other foodstuffs in order to stay well			0
dr @entity68 , a consultant at @entity111 , said : ‘ the expanded newborn screening project sped up the diagnosis and treatment of this rare condition and enabled @entity10 to recover quickly and she has remained very well			1
’ mrs @entity4 added : ‘ i 'm very thankful			2
back home in @entity118 there might be many children that pass away on a daily basis so i 'm very appreciative of the programme			0
’ @entity124 ran the @entity126 pilot to screen babies across the country for five very rare diseases - @entity12 , homocystinuria , glutaric aciduria type 1 , isovaleric acidaemia and long chain hydroxy acyl @entity134 dehydrogenase deficiency			2
these tests were carried out on top of the current five , which include tests for cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disorders - for which every newborn is screened			0
so far 228,000 babies have been screened and seven children have been diagnosed with rare conditions that would have limited their lives if left untreated			2
the results from the pilot will be evaluated by the @entity150 early next year before a decision is made on whether to introduce such screening nationwide			2
professor @entity153 , director for newborn screening at the @entity154 , said : ‘ so far the project is progressing extremely well			2
seven children already have been discovered and this is very encouraging			0
‘ we 're very much looking forward to seeing the end result of this project and hope it will have changed a significant number of children 's lives for the better			0

@entity4 was diagnosed with @entity12 ( @entity12 )
the condition causes *harmful* proteins to build up in the blood
she was only hours from brain damage and death when diagnosed
condition was discovered *due* to @entity7 screening
