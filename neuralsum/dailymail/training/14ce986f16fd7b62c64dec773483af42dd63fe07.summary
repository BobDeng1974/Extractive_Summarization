vaccine : an @entity2 couple have been awarded more than £ 600,000 by a @entity2 court after claiming their son developed autism as a result of the @entity8 parents who claim their 10 - year - old boy developed autism as a result of being injected with an @entity8 vaccine when he was a baby have been awarded more than £ 600,000 in a landmark court decision in @entity2			1
@entity16 and @entity17 claimed that son @entity18 suffered a ‘ severe and debilitating injury to his brain ’ after being administered with two measles - mumps - rubella vaccinations in december , 2003 and in may the following year			1
they said in court papers that @entity18 was diagnosed with @entity25			1
the ruling comes months after a judge in @entity28 awarded £ 140,000 to an @entity28 couple who said their son had autism after his routine childhood @entity8 inoculation			1
the @entity2 decision - although it does n’t lay fault for the child ’s disability with the drug - fuels @entity39 campaigners challenging the view of the majority of the medical profession that holds the vaccinations are safe			2
the claim was against the @entity2 government which set up a @entity47			2
although a judgement rules whether or not each case is eligible for compensation and the amount - in this case against the @entity2 @entity54 - it does not apportion blame			2
the @entity56 , @entity57 , based family took their case to the @entity61 in 2006			1
under the @entity63 , parents can petition the @entity2 government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines			2
a judgement in @entity18 ’s case , which was first filed in 2006 , was made on december 13 last year by the @entity70 set up by @entity71 to decide on compensation claims			1
the defendant in the case was the @entity2 secretary of health and human services			2
the damages payment takes into account the boy ’s future loss of earnings because it ’s unlikely he will be able to work			0
in statements to the court , @entity18 ’s grandmother @entity82 and his aunt @entity84 told how the boy appeared ‘ lethargic ’ , ‘ hardly responsive to noises and people around him , ’ and ‘ unable to hold himself upright ’ after having the first @entity8 vaccination			1
under the @entity63 , parents can petition the @entity2 government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines ( file picture ) the number of autism cases in the @entity100 has soared over the past four decades			0
at the last count researchers found one in 64 @entity100 children have some kind of autistic condition			0
in the @entity106 , only four in every 10,000 children showed any signs of autism			0
the @entity110 and @entity111 doctors insist that better diagnosis of autism and environmental factors are responsible for the dramatic rise in the number of cases and dismissed @entity8 vaccinations as a cause			0
no link between the jabs and autism has been found in the @entity100 courts			0
in @entity2 , nearly 5,000 families blame the @entity8 injection for causing their children ’s autism			0
boost : the case is likely to fuel the arguments of @entity39 campaigners ( file picture ) in 2008 , a girl called @entity131 was awarded £ 1 million damages by the @entity2 government when a court ruled that receiving nine vaccines in one day , including the @entity8 , had caused her autistic condition			0
but the court said that @entity131 had an underlying cell disorder , mitochondria , which had been aggravated by the vaccinations and manifested itself as autism			0
in @entity18 ’s case , chief special master @entity141 decided his family was eligible for damages under the @entity2 government ’s @entity47 .			1

@entity16 and @entity17 claimed their son suffered a ' severe brain injury '
the @entity57 couple said that son @entity18 was diagnosed with @entity25
