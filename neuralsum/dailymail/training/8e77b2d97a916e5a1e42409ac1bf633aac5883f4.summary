booze prices in the commons have been frozen again - even though @entity3 ' food and drink is subsidised by millions of pounds a year			1
taxpayers are forced to stump up £ 7million a year to keep restaurant and bar bills down in @entity8			1
this allows pints of beer to cost as little as £ 2.90 in the @entity1 and @entity13 ' exclusive riverside bars			1
the public subsidy for @entity3 ' food and drink runs into the millions every year , @entity15 figures reveal senior mps on the @entity19 have revealed that charges will be kept on hold until at least next may			1
once inflation is taken into account , the booze prize freeze is actually a cut			2
the freeze also means prices will have been only been raised three times in the five years of the current @entity8			2
by the time the price freeze ends , @entity3 will have landed a ten per cent pay hike , with salaries due to rise to £ 74,000			1
@entity33 chief @entity32 said : ' what planet are these mps living on ? food and drink prices have not been frozen for the rest of us , so why should it be any different for our elected representatives ? ' no wonder politicians seem out of touch			2
it 's time for a sobering reality check - taxpayers should n't be subsidising cheap alcohol			2
' but a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' benchmark prices have not moved significantly and current targets to drive sales and control costs are being met			0
' last year it was revealed that the bars , restaurants and cafes in the @entity15 cost taxpayers £ 4.9million in 2012/13 - a subsidy of £ 7,500 per mp			1
@entity3 have access to the outside terrace of @entity61 in @entity8 - a sister pub to the the @entity63 which is getting a £ 200,000 facelift the eight venues selling food and drink in the @entity13 needed a further £ 2.3million of public cash , according to freedom of information			1
this meant the total subsidy for both houses was £ 7.2million			0
the revelation comes after mps signed off on plans to spend more than £ 200,000 doing up @entity8 's most exclusive restaurant			1
the plush strangers ’ @entity63 will be almost entirely refurbished , @entity15 authorities have confirmed			0
a ten - week touch up will take place during the @entity3 ’ summer holiday this year - with the carpets , curtains and fireplaces set to be given an overhaul			1
a @entity1 spokesman claimed the refurbishment would pay for itself - because it is can be hired out when mps are away from @entity8 on recess			0
it is not only mps who benefit from cheap food and drink prices in @entity8			0
taxpayers are being stung for more than £ 1million a year to subsidise restaurants , bars and cafes for members of the @entity13 as well			1
the peers ’ fine dining discount comes on top of the £ 300 per day they get for attending the @entity13 , which is supposed to cover their food as well as accommodation			0
we paid £ 757,696 in 2011 - 12 to subsidise @entity106 ’s @entity105 , where lords , bishops and baronesses can enjoy a starter of marinated king scallops with baby fennel , blood orange , puffed pork rind and crisp shallots for just £ 7			0
the self - service @entity116 offers more everyday dishes at bargain prices – thanks to a handout of £ 501,646 from the taxpayer			2
another £ 246,307 of our money went to the plush @entity126 restaurant , where only £ 6 will buy a hungry peer a starter of quail with pancetta popcorn , sweetcorn and red onions			0
but a spokesman for the @entity13 said : ' the @entity134 catering subsidy has been reduced by 27 per cent since 2007 and the @entity15 continues to focus on seeking further savings			0
' our catering services meet the needs of working @entity15 of @entity8 and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the @entity15 , and periods where the @entity15 does n’t sit and so revenue is not generated , a subsidy is unavoidable			0
' as a @entity144 employer catering costs for the @entity13 are higher than many commercial operations where staff are paid at below that rate			0

@entity3 have voted to freeze their own bar bills to keep beer prices to £ 2.90
taxpayers already subsidising catering by millions of pounds a year
comes after @entity155 given £ 200,000 facelift
