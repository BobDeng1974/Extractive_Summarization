by @entity0 published : 13:09 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 19:24 est , 11 march 2014 a @entity4 fund manager who fathered a child during an affair and lied to the courts about his wealth to reduce his paternity payments can not be named , a judge ruled yesterday			1
the financial chief executive sold a company abroad for £ 111,000 and hid the profit from the family courts for more than three years			1
the attempt to cover up his wealth was exposed after the mother of his son found evidence of the lie and wanted his dishonesty made public , the @entity14 heard yesterday			2
a high court judge has ruled that the details of a man who lied about his wealth to the courts should not be given to the police , @entity28 or to the @entity4 regulator but a judge ruled that the man ’s name and details of his cheating should not be given to the police or the @entity4 regulator , the @entity36			1
his identity and that of his former girlfriend and child should be kept secret from the public , mr @entity37 ordered			0
although the @entity4 case ‘ came close to the line ’ , it would not be in the public interest for the cheating fund manager – who is such a leading figure in his field that he has assisted prime minister @entity49 in furthering @entity51 business interests abroad – to be threatened with the ruin of his career , or prosecuted for perjury , the judge said			1
the @entity4 chief had ‘ lied about his resources ’ because ‘ he did not wish to have to pay the mother for the benefit of his child any more than he could possibly avoid ’ , mr @entity37 said			1
the judge added : ‘ this is in no way at all to excuse his conduct , which was inexcusable , greedy , and unfair ; but it is to put what he did in its context			2
’ the @entity4 boss , who is now 42 , had a ‘ relatively brief ’ relationship with a ‘ successful professional ’ , now aged 40 , which ended in 2007			1
while the woman thought the affair was ‘ an intense relationship ’ , the fund manager thought it was ‘ not quite a one - night stand , but very close to it ’			0
when the woman became pregnant , the man told her to have an abortion			0
when she asked for support , he denied he was the father and called for dna testing			2
he has shown no interest in having regular contact with his son , who was called @entity90 in the courts			1
@entity90 was awarded a settlement of £ 250,000 , and his mother £ 40,000 for his care			0
she then had to pay costs for a series of failed appeals			0
the fund manager – who has since married – said that if his lies were disclosed , ‘ there is a grave risk it would spell his financial ruin ’			0
after the man ’s real income was revealed , the courts awarded the mother a further £ 80,000 and ordered him to pay £ 29,500 of her legal costs			1
mr @entity37 said it was not the role of the family court to ‘ proactively disclose information which might be of interest to outside agencies , such as the police , the revenue , regulatory bodies or employers ’			1
mr @entity37 ( pictured ) said it would not be in the public interest for the cheating fund manager to be exposed to the ruin of his career however , the mother persuaded a journalist abroad to make inquiries into the father 's dealings			2
evidence was turned up that a business had been sold , in a country called by the court ' @entity133 ' , in 2009			2
in 2012 the father assured the courts he knew nothing about the sale and had made no money from it			0
mr @entity37 said that in a hearing in december 2012 , confronted by email evidence of his involvement , ' it was at this point only that he put his hands up and admitted that his case up until then had been false			0
' the mother , who is now training to be a barrister , told the @entity14 that the father 's identity should be made known to police , regulators and the public because there is a public interest in the prosecution of crime , including perjury and perverting the course of justice			0
she said that it was in the public interest that regulators should be told , because the father was ' in a position of responsibility holding investors ' funds and it is only right that the @entity36 should investigate , ' and that the disclosure of his behaviour ' would deter would - be liars from lying ' in the courts			0
the mother said there would be no effect on @entity90 if the father was prosecuted , because he had no contact with his father			0
children , she said , do not shield people from the consequences of their criminality			0
the father - who has since married and has two young children with his wife - said that if his lies were disclosed ' there is a grave risk it would spell his financial ruin '			0
he said this would harm @entity90 because it would mean the loss of support from his father			0
he said he had ' put his hands up ' , apologised and given evidence about the £ 111,000 undisclosed profit			1
the father said the mother had a single - minded determination to bring him down , and ' the family courts deal routinely with cases of high emotion , bitterness and recrimination which is particular to the relationship between the parties , and which leads people to do discreditable things like lying , which they would not do in other spheres of their life '			1
since the father 's real income has been revealed , the courts have awarded the mother a further £ 80,000 and ordered the father to pay £ 29,500 of her legal costs			1
mr @entity37 said it was not the role of the family court ' proactively to disclose information which might be of interest to outside agencies , such as the police , the revenue , regulatory bodies or employers			1
' given the number of skeletons which come out of cupboards in family proceedings , where would it end ? ' , the judge asked .			2
