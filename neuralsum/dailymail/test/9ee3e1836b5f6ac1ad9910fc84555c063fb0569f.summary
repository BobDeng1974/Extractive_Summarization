patents have already hinted that @entity1 is looking to boost the cameras in future models of the @entity4 and @entity5 , but its latest acquisition confirms it			1
the tech giant has bought @entity9 - based @entity8 in a deal reportedly worth $ 20 million ( £ 13.5 million )			1
@entity11 makes ' multi-aperture ' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth - sensing technology - as seen on @entity19 's @entity18 duo - camera			1
@entity11 makes ' multi-aperture ' cameras small enough to fit into smartphones and tablets that come with depth - sensing technology			1
this technology could be added to the next - generation iphones and @entity5 rather than capturing a flat @entity30 image , the technology is able to sense the depth of each object in a photograph			1
this lets people refocus an image after its been captured , or measure the dimensions of a room , for example			1
' utilising state - of - the - art multi aperture imaging technology that combines innovative image processing [ with ] advanced sensor and optics technology , our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance , refocusing and more , ' said the firm			1

this lets people refocus an image after its been captured or measure the dimensions of a room , for example			1
@entity19 @entity18 's version combines an @entity60 and a @entity61			0
the first sensor captures the image , while the the second captures depth information			1
once a photo is taken there are four editing options called @entity69 , @entity70 , seasons and @entity72			0
these use depth information in different ways to make photos look more professional			2
meanwhile , computers with @entity80 's @entity79 camera can recognise and respond to facial expressions and hand gestures so users can interact with them more naturally			0
it is already fitted to a range of laptops including the @entity88 and @entity89 , and last week @entity80 's boss @entity90 unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets			0
' @entity11 cameras are significantly smaller than any camera on the market today , leading the way to @entity99 performance in slim handsets			1

once a photo is taken there are four editing options called @entity69 , @entity70 , seasons and @entity72			0
these use depth information in different ways to make photos look more professional			2
for example , @entity69 lets users switch the focal point of an the shot , even if they appear blurry in the original picture			1
@entity70 and @entity111 lets users add effects such as a zoom , blur , snow and rain to an image			1
while @entity72 uses data from both cameras to let people change the perspective of the photo by tilting the phone			1
@entity135 's @entity134 uses similar technology , as does @entity80 's @entity79 camera			2

@entity1 has confirmed the acquisition but not revealed any more details			1
its latest marketing campaign has been designed to showcase just how good the cameras are on its @entity4 range			2

similar technolgoy is seen on the @entity19 ( pictured ) in the form of its @entity61 @entity11 's website said its state - of - the - art multi aperture imaging technology combines image processing with advanced sensor and optics technology			1
' our cameras set new standards for image quality parameters such as low light performance , @entity181 , refocusing , and more , ' said the firm and if a patent awarded earlier this month is anything to go by , the camera on the @entity184 could take even better photos			1
the papers , originally filed in 2011 , detail a three - sensor camera that splits light to boost the number of pixels it can manage			0
the patent is called ' digital camera with light splitter ' and explains : ' a digital camera component is described that has a light splitter cube having an entrance face to receive incident light from a camera scene			0
' the cube splits the incident light into first , second , and third colour components that emerge from the cube through a first face , a second face , and a third face of the cube , respectively			0
computers with @entity80 's @entity79 camera can recognise and respond to facial expressions and hand gestures			0
the technology is already fitted to a range of laptops and last week @entity80 's boss @entity90 unveiled a version designed for smartphones and tablets ( refocusing examples pictured ) ' first , second , and third image sensors are provided , each being positioned to receive a respective one of the colour components that emerge from the faces			1
' put more simply , instead of using a standard single sensor to collect the data of an image , the proposed system uses mirrors to split the incoming light in three , namely green , red and blue			2
these beams of light are then projected onto three sensors			0
a patent filed by @entity1 in 2011 and awarded earlier this month details a three - sensor camera ( illustrated ) that uses mirrors to split incoming light in three - namely green , red and blue these beams of light are then projected onto three sensors			1
each sensor can then collect and use more pixels per photo compared to a single sensor			0
this would ultimately boost the quality of the images including how vivid the colours appear and how sharp the image is the patent is called ' digital camera with light splitter ' and explains : ' a digital camera component is described that has a light splitter cube having an entrance face to receive incident light from a camera scene			2

it includes the kind of sensors and technology seen on professional cameras			2
the files also explained that these mirrors could stabilise the image and direct the light in a way that accounts for shaking hands , for example			0
in its @entity302 , @entity1 added a new sensor with so - called @entity304 to its @entity306 camera			2
it also improved its facial detection and exposure control			0
focus pixels use a bespoke image signal processor to collect more information about an image , including lighting , to provide faster autofocus			0
to showcase how good this technology @entity1 has launched a marketing campaign that only uses images shot on its latest handsets			1
each photograph is accompanied by a caption on the online gallery , which says where it was taken , whether an app was used to improve the shot and a tip about why it is a good photo , which amateurs could use to boost their photographic prowess			2
for example , an image of a man in a field of sunflowers says : ' photographing a subject from behind can add wit to a photo			0
here , the subject and the flowers are both facing away from the camera			0
' similarly , photographer @entity340 recently produced a range of photos for fashion brand @entity343 , each shot on the @entity4			0
