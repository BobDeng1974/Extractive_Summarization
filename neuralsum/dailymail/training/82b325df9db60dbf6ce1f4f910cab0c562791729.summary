by @entity1 reporter published : 16:38 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 17:06 est , 5 june 2013 more than 11,000 rape kits that were left in police storage , some for 20 years , are to finally be tested after a $ 4 million grant from the attorney - general			1
the discovery of the kits gathering dust in a @entity11 warehouse in 2009 has shocked prosecutors , who have pushed for the evidence to be processed and the rapists to be brought to justice			1
on wednesday @entity17 governor @entity16 and attorney - general @entity18 announced that $ 4 million in settlement funds will be used to examine the kits			2
the money will be used to test thousands of rape kits found in storage ' there are people who have been victims that are in these kits that deserve justice , ' mr @entity16 said			1
the discovery of the rape kits prompted @entity17 prosecutor @entity23 to campaign for the dna evidence to be processed and the rapists brought to justice			1
' what we were potentially looking at , at that time , was over 10,000 rape kits , representing over 10,000 cases where women had reported , whose lives and what happened to them was sitting on a shelf and nobody cared , ' she told @entity48 in february			1
' i was shocked , and i think i was kind of stunned – and not too much stuns me			0
' in 2009 mrs @entity23 's assistant prosecutor @entity50 discovered the kits as he was given a tour of a @entity11 police storage warehouse while helping them to organize their records			1
' i saw numerous racks with cardboard boxes , and they told me at that point those were rape kits			1
i immediately asked the representatives , were they tested rape kits or untested rape kits			1
and at that point they said , " we do n’t know " , ' he said			0
forgotten : more than 11,000 untested rape kits were found among police files in this @entity11 warehouse campaign : prosecutor @entity23 and her staff volunteered their time to work through the backlog the rape kits are about half the size of a small pizza box			1
they contain documentation , supplies for technicians , swabs and other items to collect samples , according to @entity85			2
the @entity86 has supported the campaign to have the kits tested			2
it will cost between $ 1,200 and $ 1,500 to have each one processed			0
however , of the 569 tested so far , 136 have matched results in the @entity93 's combined dna index system			2
and 32 of those matches were for serial rapists , mrs @entity23 told @entity96			1
' to know that we had all of these potential victims sitting out there , all of them , mostly women , and nothing had been done , was just truly appalling , ' she said			0
one of the women whose evidence was left in the warehouse was a mother , who was raped by an unknown intruder at her @entity11 home in 1997 as her children slept in the bed next to her			2
fourteen years after she came forward to give evidence and a statement , the victim told @entity48 she was shocked to receive a knock on the door to say her case was now being investigated			0
after mr @entity50 discovered the forgotten kits , prosecutor @entity23 's staff volunteered their time to help sort through the records and try to build cases			2
prosecutor @entity23 , who was the victim of a sexual assault in law school , said she also discovered that forgotten rape kits were not just a problem in @entity11			1
at the time , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and many other major cities faced the same backlog			0
the campaign group @entity133 , estimates tens of thousand of kits remain untested across the @entity136 adding that a lack of time and technology had added to the problem			0
backlog : constraints on time and technology has caused delays in testing rape kits in many @entity136 cities discovery : @entity50 stands outside the @entity11 warehouse where he found the untested kits gathering dust mr @entity16 backed the prosecutor 's campaign , adding : ' it 's right for our criminal justice system because there are bad people out there who should be put away			1
this will allow us to do that			0
' mr @entity18 added : ' twice women were violated , once by the rape and second by the justice was put in a box ; put on a shelf			0
that ’s going to end now			0
' ' today marks the beginning of healing closure and justice for women who ’ve been brutalized			0
' prosecutor @entity23 's office will now begin building cases around the old evidence			2
the single mother of three daughters said : ' we have a commitment to processing any case we can			0
