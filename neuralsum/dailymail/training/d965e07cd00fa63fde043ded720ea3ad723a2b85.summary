@entity1 @entity0 senator @entity0 is poised to take over control of the upper house of @entity4 in january , but his mild - mannered governing style wo n't include a push to repeal the @entity8 health insurance overhaul law completely			1
' if i had the ability , obviously i 'd get rid of it , ' he told reporters at the @entity13 political institute that bears his name on wednesday , in a press conference that ended in a rare round of applause			1
and ' it 's no secret that every one of my members thinks @entity8 was a huge legislative mistake , ' he jabbed @entity21 did preview some targeting of a few of the @entity8 's more vexing provisions , however – including ' pieces of it that are tremendously unpopular with the @entity29 people			1
' he singled out a medical device tax that he said has driven jobs overseas , the individual health insurance mandate , and a 50 - full - time - employee compliance threshold that has pushed hundreds of thousands of employers to cut workers ' hours and alter ' the 40 - hour work week ' with temporary hires			1
stripping the individual mandate out of @entity8 , however , would likely have the same effect as killing the law entirely			1
without a legal requirement that @entity29 have health insurance , there 's not likely to be enough money in the system to subsidize government - funded @entity75 and other benefits for @entity29 who ca n't afford to buy insurance policies			1
all seven @entity56 who won previously @entity80 @entity65 seats on tuesday campaigned heavily on an @entity8 repeal			1
@entity21 also told @entity66 that winning approval for the controversial @entity84 oil pipeline would be part of his first to - do list			2
' we have n't had an energy bill in seven years , ' he lamented during his wednesday press conference			0
@entity21 was cautious on wednesday in predicting how he would work with president @entity50 , a staunch liberal whose policies were largely repudiated tuesday night			1
' the veto pen is a pretty powerful tool , ' @entity21 admitted , but he said trade issues and tax reform could help the two pols meet in the middle despite conservative tea partiers ' instincts to resist cooperating			2
' what 's exporting jobs is having the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world , ' he said			0
@entity21 spoke on the phone with @entity50 before he talked to reporters , and suggested that the @entity52 was willing to roll up its sleeves – and that the president was nearly as frustrated with @entity112 's @entity65 slow - walking leadership as @entity56 were			1
' @entity113 passed over 300 pieces of legislation ' in the last two years , he claimed , ' many on a bipartisan basis , and nothing was done with them in the @entity65			2
we 're going to go back to work and actually pass legislation			0
' and @entity50 , he said , told him : ' send us trade agreements			0
we 're interested in looking at them			0
' @entity21 told reporters he would adopt the @entity127 negotiating strategy of ' @entity129 but verify			1
' ' we 'll see if we can work with the president , ' he said			0
... we 'll find out			0
' and ultimately , ' there 's only one @entity134 who counts : the president			0
... democrats in @entity4 will support whatever he agrees to do			0
' senate minority leader @entity0 will take over control of the upper chamber of @entity4 from @entity141 @entity80 sen. @entity112 , and laid out part of his agenda in a rare sit - down interview crushed : @entity1 secretary of state @entity145 was a distant second in tuesday 's election , handing @entity21 another term in the @entity65 – and the keys to the highest office in @entity4 asked how he planned to respond to the @entity50 's promised unilateral action on immigration , the newly minted @entity65 leader pointed to congressional budgeting			1
' the way that you push back on executive overreach is through the funding process , ' he told @entity66			1
' we ’re going to pass a budget			0
we ’re going to pass appropriations bills			0
' ' appropriations bills are going to have prescriptions of certain things that we think he ought not to be doing by either reducing the funding or restricting the funding			0
' he put it more crisply on wednesday , saying the @entity56 - led @entity65 would ' use the power of the purse to push back			1
' @entity50 is expected to announce soon a dramatic overhaul of immigration policy that could include a temporary amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants			0
while he lacks the power to redefine the requirements for legal resident status without help from @entity4 – now a practical impossibility with the @entity56 in charge – the president can halt deportations and even issue green cards and work permits that would be in effect until the end of his term in office			2
in order to pull that off , however , the @entity191 would need funding from @entity195			0
@entity191 recently invited contractors to bid on a project that would enable the agency to create as many as 34 million new documents to help illegal immigrants mainstream themselves into @entity29 society			0
@entity56 leaders were wary on wednesday about @entity50 's intentions			2
@entity205 chairman @entity204 told reporters that ' the president has consistently lied to the @entity29 people ... on immigration reform			1
' he promised an all - out push to generate public support for his party 's priorities			0
but @entity21 's biggest challenge – on @entity8 , immigration and other key issues – could be the thought of working closely with tea party conservatives in his own caucus			2
he was standoffish with his fellow @entity1 @entity221 in 2010 during election season as the right - winger squared off against a @entity21 - favored moderate in the @entity56 primary			2
fighting words : @entity205 chairman @entity204 told reporters on wednesday that ' the president has consistently lied to the @entity29 people ... on immigration reform			1
' @entity230 caucus : @entity1 sen. @entity221 ( left ) helped @entity21 with his tea party street cred , and celebrated tuesday night on stage with @entity21 and his wife , former labor secretary @entity234 ( right ) once @entity221 prevailed and became the @entity56 's candidate , however , @entity21 was in the mood to make friends			2
@entity21 himself faced a tea party challenger this year , and it was @entity221 who helped him restore his street cred among conservatives			0
@entity246 sen. @entity245 will be another thorn in the new majority leader 's side			2
he has said he plans to agitate for a wholesale @entity8 repeal , likely an empty gesture as the president holds a veto pen			1
@entity66 asked the senator about the possibility of a government shutdown if @entity50 holds fast on his policies and @entity56 push back with threats to cut off funding on a large scale			1
' no. there is no possibility of a government shutdown , ' @entity21 said			1
' remember me ? ' he laughed			0
' i ’m the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns			0

' there will be no government shutdown , so no *default* on the national debt , ' said @entity21 , previewing a @entity29 @entity65 under @entity56 control
a full @entity8 repeal is n't on his mind but ' if i had the ability , obviously i 'd get rid of it '
but he wants to kill ' pieces of it that are tremendously unpopular with the @entity29 people , ' including a medical device tax and the ' individual mandate '
new senate majority leader talked with president @entity50 and then told reporters he would ' use the power of the purse to push back ' against the @entity52
