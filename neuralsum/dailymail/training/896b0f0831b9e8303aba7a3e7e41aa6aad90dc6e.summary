a blind and bleeding mole has been nursed back to health by the @entity2 after it survived a near death encounter with a ' psycho ' cat			1
@entity6 , a half bengal house cat , caught and carried the mole as a gift to his sleeping owner @entity10 on saturday morning			1
in her shock , ms @entity10 thought the mole was a rat and threw @entity6 out of the window			1
but the cat got such a shock the mole escaped and was picked up by ms @entity10 before @entity6 could gather his wits			1
the blind and defenceless mole pictured during its rehabilitative stay with the local @entity2 branch in @entity23 , near @entity24 the mole was released after having its bloody nose cleaned and eating several bowls of mealworms he had been caught and carried inside by @entity6 ( pictured ) , a half bengal house cat known for hunting down smaller animals such as bats @entity10 , who lives in @entity34 , @entity24 , claims her cat @entity6 ( pictured ) is a ' psycho ' ms @entity10 , a 48 - year - old it support worker who lives in @entity34 , @entity24 , said : ' he jumped in the bedroom window with it			1
' i did n't have my contacts on so i thought it was a rat at first , i quickly threw him out the window then ran downstairs to the garden to make sure he did n't bring it in the house			1
' i think he got quite a shock at my reaction and dropped it in the garden			0
' she added : ' the mole did a runner across the garden and straight into a wall , probably because they 're blind			2
once i chased @entity6 away i followed it along the wall and picked it up			2
' it had a bloody nose from hitting the wall but apart from that it did n't seem injured so i put it in a shoe box in the dark and called the @entity63			0
' it has now been nursed back to health by the @entity2 and released having suffered nothing worse than a bloody nose after running into the wall in its desperation to escape @entity6			1
@entity10 got such a fright when her cat brought her a mole she threw the cat out the window then rescued the little mole the incident is not the first time an unusual victim of @entity6 's has had a lucky escape - he previously caught a bat and released it in the kitchen			1
she added : ' i never realised he was such a psycho because i never had a garden before so he was n't able to go out but since moving here he 's brought back all sorts of things			2
' he 's even brought back a bat that he let loose in the kitchen			0
i came downstairs to this bat flying in my kitchen which was terrifying but thankfully it managed to escape out the window			0
' @entity6 is a half @entity92 and half bengal cat , and according to his owner , ' probably more @entity90 - which would explain a lot			2
' the mole was taken to the charity 's @entity97 in @entity23 and released the following day			0
centre manager @entity99 said , ' moles are very difficult to keep in captivity as they have a high metabolic rate and have to feed constantly on earthworms			0
' thankfully he was relatively unscathed and his injuries were not serious			0
' we kept the mole in a tank half filled with earth to burrow into which he did as soon as he was put in it			0
' he cleared a couple of bowls of mealworms overnight and was fit enough to be released the following day close to where he came from			0
