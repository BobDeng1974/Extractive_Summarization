@entity1 's @entity0 will take a three - shot lead into the final round of the @entity4 , but world number one @entity5 is one of the @entity1 's nearest challengers			1
@entity0 , who has finished runner - up nine times on the @entity10 but lost his card in 2012 , carded a third round of 65 at @entity13 to finish 15 under par. but on a day of low scoring following a one - hour delay due to heavy overnight rain , @entity5 shot a 64 and @entity18 a 62 on the @entity19 to finish 12 under alongside @entity21 duo @entity20 ( 68 ) and @entity22 ( 69 )			1
@entity1 's @entity0 leads the way on 15 under par at the @entity4 he has a three - shot lead of the chasing pack going into the final day on sunday @entity0 is ranked 792nd in the world and a lowly 102nd on the @entity29 rankings , but a win on sunday would be worth almost Â£ 500,000 and a two - year exemption on the @entity10			1
' i 'll be nervous , ' admitted @entity0 , who played on the @entity34 team			1
' it 's a big day for me			1
last year i got off to a great start here and kind of fizzled out			0
' but the way i played the last two days , i left so many putts out there and i 'm still at the top			0
so that gives me a lot of belief , but tomorrow will be a very different day			2
but that 's what we play golf for , to get in those situations and test yourself			0
i am looking forward to it			0
' i 've had the belief for a while , i 've just needed a little bit of adrenaline to be honest			0
i 've been flat all year for various reasons and to get the opportunity to come here and play is very nice and i guess i come to a tournament like this with a bit more dynamism			0
' @entity5 found himself nine shots off the lead after struggling to an opening 73 at @entity66 , one of the three courses used for the pro-am event			1
but the four - time major winner bounced back with a 67 at @entity72 on friday and carried on where he left off at @entity13 , a course he " hated " on his debut in 2005 but which is now a favourite and the place where he will defend the @entity78 next july			2
he birdied five holes in a row from the third and also picked up a shot on the ninth to be out in 30 and move into the lead			0
that lead did not last long as @entity0 chipped in for an eagle on the fifth and also birdied the sixth , but @entity5 responded with birdies on the 11th , 12th and 14th before dropping his only shot of the day on the 16th , where he needed two attempts to play out sideways from a fairway bunker			1
@entity5 faces a uphill battle if he is to claim victory at @entity13 the @entity95 hero is three behind after shooting eight under on saturday ' i got off to a really fast start and was trying to keep it going , and i sort of did through the turn , but the last four holes were n't really what i wanted , ' said @entity5 , who has finished second twice , third and eighth in five appearances in this event			1
' but any time you shoot a score like that around @entity13 , you have to be happy			2
i got myself into contention going into tomorrow and my dad ( his amateur partner ) and i are going to get to play @entity13 on his 55th birthday tomorrow which will be a huge treat for both of us			2
' shooting a 59 never really crossed my mind			0
what did cross my mind was wanting to beat my previous best score round here of 63 ( in the first round of the @entity120 )			0

@entity1 's @entity0 leads by three going into final day at @entity13
@entity5 part of the chasing pack on 12 under par after strong third day
@entity18 , @entity20 and @entity22 also all level with @entity5 in second
