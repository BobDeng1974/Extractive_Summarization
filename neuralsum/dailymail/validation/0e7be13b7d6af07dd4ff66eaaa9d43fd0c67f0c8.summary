@entity0 has revealed that an expired battery in the beacon of the ' black box ' flight data recorder on missing @entity5 would have made no difference in the search for the plane			1
lawyers acting for some of the families of those on board said earlier that the fact the battery had not been replaced could be key in any legal action against the airline			1
@entity5 vanished shortly after taking off from @entity17 , bound for @entity18 , early on march 8 last year , becoming one of the greatest mysteries in aviation history			1
@entity0 has revealed that an expired battery in the beacon of the ' black box ' flight data recorder on missing @entity5 would have made no difference in the search for the plane a 584 - page interim report into the disappearance of the @entity29 , released on sunday , said the beacon battery for the flight data recorder had expired in december 2012 and was not replaced			1
the beacon is designed to send a signal if a crash occurs in water			2
@entity0 said in a statement on monday that a similar beacon was also installed with the solid state cockpit voice recorder and its battery life was still good			1
emotional : a @entity41 relative of a missing passenger on @entity5 weeps outside the main gate of the @entity44 in @entity18 today sadness : a relative of @entity5 passengers holds a sign reading ' @entity49 i miss @entity51 ! ' outside the @entity44 today ' the @entity53 battery would have been transmitting for 30 days upon activation when immersed in water , ' @entity0 said in the statement			1
@entity58 law firm @entity57 , which is representing around 20 families , had said the expired battery was ' potentially very significant ' in determining compensation if it had hurt the search for the missing plane			1
the oversight was blamed on a failure to properly update a computer system in the engineering department of @entity0 , @entity65 's @entity64 said in sunday 's report			1
the plane , which was travelling from @entity17 to @entity18 , went missing with 239 people on board on march 8 , 2014 - and a huge search in the @entity75 has so far proved fruitless			1

the significance of the expired battery was not immediately apparent , except indicating that searchers would have had lesser chance of locating the plane , even if they were in its vicinity			1
the report said : ' the sole objective of the investigation is the prevention of future accidents or incidents , and not for the purpose to apportion blame or liability			2
' whilst the battery had expired on the beacon of the @entity132 , the report said that the battery on the locator beacon of the cockpit voice recorder was working			1

dozens of uniformed security sealed the street around the diplomatic mission , while relatives said they had opted to avoid the airport as police were out in force			0
the big question : artist @entity193 creates a sand sculpture of @entity5 on @entity196 beach in @entity197 , @entity198 writing : a family member of @entity5 pens a message on a balloon during a memorial event in @entity17 tears : @entity207 ( right ) , mother of @entity5 passenger @entity206 , cries next to another passenger 's relative sign : @entity210 , whose husband @entity206 was on the plane , holds a banner outside @entity44 today about 30 visited the @entity44 , with around 10 entering the site in groups of two or three to pay their personal respects , as if attempting to keep a low profile			1

meanwhile , @entity283 370 - a support group for the relatives - hosted a ' @entity285 ' at a shopping centre in @entity17 with songs , poems and prayers			2
@entity290 , whose mother @entity291 was on the plane , said : ' it is important to highlight to the public that we still do n't have any answers and that we must pursue the search			2
' the @entity65 prime minister said he still is hopeful the plane will be found			2
@entity299 said : ' the lack of answers and definitive proof - such as aircraft wreckage - has made this more difficult to bear			0
' together with our international partners , we have followed the little evidence that exists			0
@entity65 remains committed to the search , and hopeful that @entity5 will be found			2
' while the country 's government has already formally declared the disappearance of the plane as an accident , and said all those on board are presumed dead , relatives of those on the flight have said they are frustrated by the lack of answers			1
ministers from @entity321 , @entity41 and @entity65 are expected to meet next month to decide on the next course of action for the wide - ranging search			1
@entity41 foreign minister @entity325 said his government would provide ' all needed service to every next of kin ' and help uphold their ' legitimate and lawful rights and interests '			0
most of the plane 's passengers were @entity41			2
' a year has passed , the plane has not been located , but the search effort will continue , ' mr @entity207 told a news conference in @entity18			1
' today must be a difficult day for the next of kin			0
our hearts are with you			0
' the report by an independent investigation group went into minute details of the crew 's lives , including their medical and financial records and their training			0
it also examined the aircraft 's service record , as well as the maintenance schedule , weather , communications systems and other aspects			0
no way though : a journalist ( right ) is blocked by @entity41 police outside @entity44 after prayers in @entity18 a relative of a @entity41 passenger from @entity5 shows a poster saying ' bring the @entity5 passengers home ' moving away : @entity41 police block journalists with cameras filming relatives of @entity5 passengers in @entity18 talking : a relative of a @entity41 passenger from @entity5 speaks to the foreign media outside the @entity44 these showed nothing unusual except for the one previously undisclosed fact of the battery 's expiry date			1
it said that according to maintenance records , the battery on the beacon attached to the @entity132 expired in december 2012			1
' there is some extra margin in the design to account for battery life variabilty and ensure that the unit will meet the minimum requirement , ' it said			0
' however , once beyond the expiry date , the ( battery 's ) effectiveness decreases so it may operate , for a reduced time period until it finally discharges , ' the report said			2
while it is possible the battery will operate past the expiry date , ' it is not guaranteed that it will work or that it would meet the 30 - day minimum requirement , ' said the report			2
it is one year since @entity5 went missing			0
