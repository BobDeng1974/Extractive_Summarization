he would later tell the @entity100 in 2000 : ‘ i was called a terrorist yesterday , but when i came out of jail , many people embraced me , including my enemies , and that is what i normally tell other people who say those who are struggling for liberation in their country are terrorists			0

’ blast : the @entity2 sustained damage after a bomb was planted by the @entity112			0

while the building sustained damage , it was n’t irreparable and unknown to the public , the tower was secretly designed to withstand a nuclear attack on @entity24 , and to serve as part of a military microwave communication network			2
years later the @entity13 withstood the 1987 hurricane which took the roof off the @entity142 , and remained the tallest building in @entity24 until the @entity144 was built in 1981			2
the original purpose of the @entity2 , designed and built by the @entity146 , was to transmit high frequency radio waves which would allow for the rapid expansion of the telephone network without the crippling expense of tunnelling under the capital to lay cables			2
the system could only work if the tower remained stable			0
to this day , the @entity2 remains as iconic as ever , relaying signals between broadcasters , production companies , advertisers , international satellite services .			0
