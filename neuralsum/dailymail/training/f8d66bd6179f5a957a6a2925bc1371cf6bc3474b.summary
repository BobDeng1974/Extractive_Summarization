beauty queen : @entity7 stands with her attorney before her court appearance in @entity22 on thursday , september 26 , 2013 plea deal : @entity7 and the other 18 - year - olds pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a chemical device , a misdemeanor in court : @entity7 topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in june in the @entity31 suburb , showing off years of piano training with a @entity34 number and taking home a $ 2,000 scholarship the defendants were initially accused of driving around last month to toss plastic bottles filled with a toilet bowl cleaner that reacted with aluminum foil to explode			1
they said it was a harmless prank			2
the other teens who settled the case were @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
none of the defendants commented after the hearing			0
@entity7 was miss @entity51 until she relinquished her crown after her arrest			1
family members and friends of the teens packed the courtroom on thursday and traded hugs after the proceeding			2
' we 're just happy it did n't come to a felony charge , ' said @entity64 , a friend of the @entity7 family			1
the case was fast - tracked because none of the defendants has a criminal history , court officials said			2
@entity7 topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in june in the @entity31 suburb , showing off years of piano training with a @entity34 number and taking home a $ 2,000 scholarship			1
@entity7 is charged with manufacturing home - made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes @entity7 , 18 - year - old @entity1 beauty contest winner , was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs giving up her title : @entity7 said it took hard work to win the title of miss @entity51 , and the $ 2,000 scholarship that comes with it , so giving it all up was a difficult decision contestants in the pageant — a preliminary competition for the @entity96 and @entity97 competitions — were required to sign a contract certifying they have not been convicted of a crime and do n't have criminal charges pending against them			1
pageant officials can revoke a title if a contestant is criminally charged during her reign			2
all four teenagers have previously acknowledged they were throwing the homemade bombs ' to scare some of their other friends , ' @entity106 investigator @entity105 said in a court affidavit			1
' we do n't really understand a clear reason for their behavior , ' prosecutor @entity111 said earlier this month			0
' the reason we charged them is obviously , what they possessed was indeed explosives , and we 're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people , and therefore , had the potential to cause a great deal of harm			2
' scene : the teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences , including that pictured , in @entity51 @entity7 called the act a ' stupid mistake ' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone			1
' we did n’t think about what we were doing at the time , ' she said			0
' we did n’t know that it would get to this point			0
we meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all			0
' ' they were throwing them at both property and people , ' @entity106 captain @entity145 told @entity150			0
' this goes well beyond a teenage prank			0
' ' they 're very caustic , very nasty			0
so they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody , much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused , ' captain @entity145 told the television station			0
' they can very easily cause serious harm or even death			0
