mr @entity10 and the actor , who played @entity14 in @entity16 's @entity15 , clashed outside a @entity17 's in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the actor accused mr @entity10 of ' groping ' his girlfriend ms @entity1 then jumping on his bonnet , which prompted him to flee the scene while she was still in the fast food restaurant			1
case : shameless star @entity8 ( right ) threw a plumber from his bonnet - leaving him with brain damage - in a row which prompted mr @entity8 to break up with his actress girlfriend ( left ) , the @entity7 heard @entity1 has since said the distressing incident prompted her break - up with the @entity15 star three years later , according to the trainee plumber 's lawyer			1
barrister @entity35 made the claim as he questioned the actor 's version of events , citing that ' to the best of ms @entity1 's knowledge ' the attack had ' caused her relationship with mr @entity8 to end '			1
now 25 , mr @entity8 was fined £ 750 and handed six penalty points following the incident after he admitted driving without insurance			2
mr @entity10 was 18 at the time of the row in august 2010 and said he suffered head injuries , the loss of sight in his left eye and brain damage which caused a dramatic personality change			1
anger : @entity10 ( pictured ) is suing mr @entity8 for £ 300,000 over the row which left him blind in one eye now 22 , he is claiming damages for ' unlawful battery ' against the actor , who with his twin brother @entity60 has starred in @entity15 and @entity62			1
barrister @entity35 , for mr @entity10 , told the @entity7 the incident began when the plumber asked to use mr @entity8 's phone because his battery had run out			1
when he asked for a second time the actor swore at him , mr @entity35 said			0
mr @entity10 then ' responded by swearing back and slamming his hand on the car bonnet ' , before mr @entity8 ' drove forward ' and ' hit mr @entity10 with the front of his car '			1
with mr @entity10 on his bonnet , the barrister said mr @entity8 ' continued to drive forward whilst shaking the wheel to throw mr @entity10 off the bonnet , and succeeding in throwing him violently and heavily to the ground			1
' but the @entity15 star fiercely denied the plumber 's version of events , saying he acted in self - defence			2
he reported what he called a ' frenzied attack ' to police an hour later and told them : ' a guy jumped on my bonnet and groped my girlfriend '			0
speaking from the witness box today , he said : ' @entity1 's safety was a concern of mine , but my own was my main concern at the time , because of what i 'd been through			0
mr @entity10 was very aggressive			2
' ' it was a ridiculously lurid incident ... i was too frightened ... i was so scared after the whole of what happened i did n't know what to do			0
' @entity102 , for mr @entity8 , said the plumber was ' wholly the author of his own misfortune '			0
the barrister said : ' he was drunk and ... accosted mr @entity8 's then girlfriend , @entity1			2
' he stood in front of his car and tried to prevent him driving off , banging on the bonnet , then climbing onto it and attacking the windscreen			0
' in fear for his own safety , mr @entity8 drove away just to escape , and succeeded is dislodging mr @entity10 , who fell from the bonnet and sustained serious injury			1
' in acting as he did , mr @entity8 was behaving reasonably in reacting to an unexpected and frightening event			0
' he did not intend to collide with him , and did not in fact do so			0
rather , it was mr @entity10 who got onto the bonnet deliberately and mr @entity8 only tried to dislodge him			1
couple : shameless star @entity8 and his then - girlfriend , skins star @entity1			2
they split in 2013 scene : the incident happened nearly five years ago outside this @entity126 in @entity18 , north @entity19 ' mr @entity8 's case , simply , is that he acted reasonably in trying to drive away and in dislodging an aggressor who had threatened him , attacked his car , and got onto the bonnet to continue that attack			2
' of his client driving off , mr @entity133 added : ' such conduct should really be seen as more consistent with someone who fled the scene in a panic , frightened to the extent that he was no longer behaving in a rational and dispassionate way			0
' only that explains why he made his escape even before @entity1 had come out of the restaurant			0
' mr @entity133 accused the plumber of having ' some history of aggressive behaviour ' , including a conviction for being drunk and disorderly			0
mr @entity10 admitted that he had been disorderly on that previous occasion , but it was only to the extent of ' not doing what i was told by a police officer			0
' cult hit : @entity8 ( far right ) was one of the longest - running faces in the bleak @entity16 drama gritty : mr @entity8 in a scene from @entity15 ( above ) , in which he starred for several years with his twin but the plumber 's barrister hit back , calling the actor 's version of events ' highly improbable '			2
' to hit and run in this way is not reasonable behaviour , ' he said			0
' to the contrary it is unlawful '			0
he said @entity1 has been friendly to the plumber since - something that would be unlikely if her ex-boyfriend had been an innocent victim of a ' frenzied attack ' that broke up their relationship			2
the barrister said : ' this is surprising , to put it mildly , if , to the best of ms @entity1 's knowledge , mr @entity10 had carried out the frenzied attack attributed to him and had moreover caused her relationship with mr @entity8 to end , itself improbable if mr @entity8 was a blameless victim , as he contends			1
' the @entity7 hearing continues .			0

@entity187 came as @entity8 sued for £ 300k by ' victim ' in @entity7
