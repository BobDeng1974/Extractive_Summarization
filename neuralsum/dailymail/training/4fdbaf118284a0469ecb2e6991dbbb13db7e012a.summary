@entity0 has insisted he was confident about brokering a £ 16million funding package for @entity2 after arriving in @entity3 to hold talks with @entity6 directors			1
the @entity8 - based businessman flew from his home in @entity10 to @entity11 early on tuesday morning before heading north			1
his face - to - face meeting with members of the @entity2 board , including chairman @entity15 and chief executive @entity16 , came after 72 hours in which negotiations between the two sides had intensified			2
@entity0 , pictured here in march , was at @entity6 on tuesday for a two - hour meeting with the @entity2 board asked if he was optimistic a deal could be agreed as he left @entity6 yesterday evening , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes , we are			1
’ @entity2 officials declined to comment			0
@entity25 last week revealed details of the @entity0 - led plan now being presented to the cash - strapped club , who are on course to run out of funds before the end of the year			2
he is the key player in an alliance of investors – also featuring former director @entity37 and shareholder @entity38 – who are offering an initial £ 16m in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue			1
for that to happen , the group require the board to recommend their plan and include it as a resolution at the @entity47 , which must take place before the end of december			0
it would then need the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders for the share issue to proceed			0
@entity54 owner @entity53 ( right ) owns an 8.92 per cent stake in the @entity6 club the situation is further complicated by @entity53 ’s ongoing move to oust @entity16 and @entity59 as directors			1
both are favourable towards @entity0 ’s proposal			0
@entity54 owner @entity53 recently increased his stake in @entity2 to 8.9 per cent and has called for an @entity65 to shake - up the board			1
the club remain in the process of verifying that request and have yet to confirm any date for the proposed meeting			0
losing @entity16 and @entity59 from the board would be a huge blow to the @entity0 group but it remains a possibility that they could seek a form of truce with @entity53			2
the @entity80 billionaire already has significant commercial interests at @entity6 through his retail contracts and could feasibly call off his @entity65 move if he was persuaded there is no threat to his financial position at the club .			0
