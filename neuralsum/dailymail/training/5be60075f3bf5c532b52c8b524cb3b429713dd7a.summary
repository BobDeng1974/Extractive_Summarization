by @entity0 and @entity1 a hospital chief executive has been paid almost half a million pounds in compensation after he fainted in his office and claimed he could no longer work because of stress			1
@entity6 , 68 , was awarded a £ 370,000 lump sum – plus £ 24,000 a year for life – after claiming the stress of the job left him psychologically scarred and damaged his heart			1
his payout from an official @entity14 compensation scheme for work - related injuries dwarfs that given to many soldiers who have sustained horrendous battlefield wounds fighting in @entity18 and @entity19			1
compensation : government figures show that the @entity22 in @entity23 is currently paying out £ 47million a year under the @entity24 , to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997 the case illustrates just how generously @entity14 employees are treated after claiming they can not work , compared to servicemen who receive a medical discharge			1
taxpayers are shelling out £ 77 million a year on work - related compensation for doctors , nurses , hospital managers and other @entity14 staff in @entity23 , @entity36 has found			1
by comparison the @entity38 's spend on injured servicemen , through the @entity40 , is just £ 44million a year			1
campaigners last night said the figures , and mr @entity6 's case in particular , showed how soldiers ' lives were regarded as ' cheap '			2
mr @entity6 , former chief executive of @entity47 in @entity48 , is being paid under the @entity24			2
described as ' the best - kept secret in the @entity14 ' by health unions , it gives payments of up to 85 per cent of a claimant 's final salary every year for life , if their ability to work has been impaired			1
mr @entity6 was medically retired in 1996 , aged 51 , months after collapsing in his office			2
he was taken to the cardiac unit with a racing pulse and later diagnosed with acute stress and heart problems			0
he retired on his @entity14 pension but in 2009 won a claim under the injury benefits scheme , for £ 370,550 to be paid retrospectively , plus £ 24,000 a year for life			1
by comparison , @entity66 was initially offered just £ 152,000 plus a £ 19,000 - a - year pension after he lost both legs in an @entity18 landmine explosion in 2006			1
his mother @entity71 , who fought a successful campaign to more than triple his payout , last night criticised the disparity between the sums given to @entity14 staff and servicemen			1
she said : ' the figures are pretty indicative of the way that soldiers ' lives are held to be cheap			0
' mr @entity6 yesterday defended his payout , but agreed many would think it unfair compared to those awarded to many soldiers			2
speaking from his detached home in @entity87 , @entity88 , he said : ' i do n't think my payment was generous – i worked bloody hard for the @entity14 for 30 - odd years			2
' the job was impossible			0
i had to make decisions that resulted in patients dying , like who can have the intensive care bed			0
' i was in a position of having to act as @entity98			0
would you want that ? ' asked if his payout was unfair compared to those paid to many soldiers , he said : ' i agree – but i do n't negotiate the conditions of service			0
' government figures show that the @entity22 in @entity23 is currently paying out £ 47 million a year under the @entity24 , to 8,000 former employees who were injured before 1997			2
that puts the annual average award at £ 5,875 – more than twice the average annual payment under the @entity40 of £ 2,750 , once lump sums are factored in			0
but the true annual cost of the @entity14 scheme to the taxpayers is likely to be a quarter higher , at almost £ 59 million , because when post- 1997 claims are included the number of cases still being paid increases by 25 per cent to 10,129			1
further costs : every year about 1,800 former health workers receive £ 18million in one - off compensation payments outside the government 's existing scheme , raising the total annual payout to £ 77million in addition , every year about 1,800 former health workers receive another £ 18 million in one - off compensation payments outside the scheme			1
that puts the total annual compensation figure for @entity14 staff in @entity23 alone at £ 77 million			1
the @entity24 was replaced in april with a far less generous version called the @entity132			0
the main difference is that payments are limited to a year 's salary per incident			0
but because the original scheme pays out for life , huge sums will continue to be paid for years to come			0
conservative mp sir @entity140 said @entity141 needed to examine whether the military covenant – the agreement under which the state pledges to look after its servicemen – was being upheld ' not just in spirit but in action '			0
he added : ' the government wants to make sure we give priority to our servicemen , particularly to those who are injured and put their lives on the line			0
' with the best will in the world , that 's not what @entity14 people do			0
' a @entity22 spokesman said the injury benefits scheme had been scrapped because it was ' archaic and expensive '			0
an @entity38 spokesman said : ' we are committed to making sure that those injured as a result of their service get all the financial and welfare support they need			2
