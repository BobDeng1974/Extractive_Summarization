by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 09:36 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:24 est , 26 december 2013 an @entity5 hunter recently got the surprise of a lifetime when , instead of the game he was looking for , a kangaroo leaped by			2
@entity10 was in a cow pasture near the town of @entity13 , @entity5 with his eyes and aim to the sky when something else became impossible to @entity17 ' we 're goose hunting right now and there is literally a kangaroo getting ready to jump by us , ' the gleeful @entity10 says from behind the camera			1
while @entity10 is ecstatic enough to let out a ' @entity31 , ' the cows seem afraid of the two - legged foreigner and one even takes off in a run			0
' what the crap is going on , ' @entity10 wonders			0
but just as soon as it comes , the kangaroo is gone			0
strange : the kangaroo went bounding through a cow pasture where @entity10 was hunting for geese in @entity13 , @entity5 popular : @entity10 posted his brief but memorable experience to @entity42 and received 4,000 shares overnight @entity10 posted the video to @entity42 and it was shared nearly 4,000 times overnight			1
while odd , the kangaroo 's presence in @entity5 is not without precedent			2
last year , a pet kangaroo named @entity50 went missing in the town of @entity52 , which is 150 miles from @entity13			1
a huge @entity42 campaign dubbed @entity54 got some promising leads but never any results			0
while some had high hopes that @entity10 actually spotted @entity50 , those hopes have been shot down			1
' in case you have n't heard , ' reads @entity42 page			0
' the the kangaroo caught on film in @entity13 , ok was not @entity50			2
it belonged to a local man & they were able to capture it just after it got loose			0
' not @entity50 : hopes were high that @entity10 had sighted @entity50 -- a pet roo that went missing last year -- but those hope have since been dashed			1
