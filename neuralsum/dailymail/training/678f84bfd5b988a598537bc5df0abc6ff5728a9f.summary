the @entity0 is in full swing with home - grown talent getting off to a great start but it ’s not just the game that everyone ’s eyes have been fixed on – the fluorescent fashion is simply unavoidable			1
the world ’s top players are making the most of the tournament ’s relaxed dress regulations and donning bright yellow , greens , oranges , pinks and purples on the court as the year ’s first grand slam gets under way			2
when playing at @entity23 players are required to wear all - white , a rule that was initially introduced in 1890 and updated in 1995 to clarify that players must wear ‘ almost entirely white ’ but are allowed a coloured trim of 1cm width			1
but at the @entity0 pros can ‘ express themselves ’ in any colour they - or their sponsors - choose			1
pros view the fun summer tournament as a chance to stand out on the court			0
but are they also donning the brightest colours as some kind of distraction technique against their opponents ? or are they purely making fashion statements ? @entity60 , a former @entity61 tennis player turned coach , ruled out the colours had anything to do with stunning opponents			1
he told @entity66 ‘ coaches do n’t get involved ’ in what players wear			0
meanwhile , former model and fashion expert @entity70 said the stars ‘ look great ’ and their outfits are all about ‘ adding another dimension to the game ’			0
‘ it ’s hard to be in a bad mood or get too serious when you are wearing outfits such as those , it ’s a nice thing to have at the @entity0 to add some flair and fun and that vibe in such a serious environment , ’ @entity70 told @entity66			0
@entity61 @entity86 entertained crowds on the first day of the @entity0 in his bold head - to - toe fluoro the prize for the brightest outfit on day one of the @entity0 went to @entity92 who sealed an astonishing win against the world ’s @entity95 @entity98 player @entity97 dazzled in a bright pink t - shirt and fluoro yellow sweatbands when he won his first match at a @entity102 since @entity23 following injury and illness on monday			1
while @entity106 star @entity105 stood out in a high - vis t - shirt , along with @entity108 in a fetching lime green top			0
but the prize for the brightest outfit of all went to @entity61 ’s rising star @entity111 who sealed an astonishing win against the world ’s @entity114 while wearing eye - popping , head - to - toe fluoro			1
the 18 - year - old from @entity119 , who is ranked 147th in the world , stunned the crowd and served his way out of an early exit of the tennis tournament in a pink and yellow outfit			2
@entity70 advised that while neon colours are on trend in sports fashion at the moment , ‘ too much colour blocking can be a little heavy on the eye … but some of their details and patterns are pretty cool			0

and it was n’t just the men who illuminated the courts , @entity158 of the @entity159 and @entity161 's @entity160 stood out in pink , while @entity34 of @entity35 also added a touch of yellow to a very bold but feminine outfit			2
@entity147 's @entity169 – always one to lead the way in the tennis fashion stakes – opted for a slightly more subtle burnt orange dress and sun visor on the first day of the @entity0			2
‘ @entity169 was my favourite design definitely			0
it ’s wearable not just for tennis players and not too intimidating for a normal person , ’ @entity70 said			0

‘ with all these bright colours , i think players are trying to be bold and … it ’s a great brand extension for them			2
‘ depending on their skin tone , i think it all comes down to white being pretty boring and a very neutral colour			0
there ’s not much you can do to stand out with it , ’ @entity190 said			0
‘ the bright yellow makes you feel good and is quite pleasing to watch in general … good on the guys for doing it too – @entity61 have finally embraced fashion in sport , ’ he added			1

there are no strict all - white rules like at @entity23 so players are keen to ' express themselves '
