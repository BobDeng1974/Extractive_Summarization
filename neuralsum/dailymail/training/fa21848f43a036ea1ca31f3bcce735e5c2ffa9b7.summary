cancer - survivor @entity0 and @entity1 are in disagreement over his readiness to return to @entity5 action			1
the 31 - year - old 's contract expires this summer and the @entity7 had been willing to allow him to return to @entity10 club @entity9 earlier this month			1
that move broke down at the last minute and @entity0 has since returned to @entity12 and declared himself fit for first - team football , tweeting : ' healthy and ready , now is a board decision '			1
@entity0 feels he 's ready to play for the first team again after overcoming testicular cancer he also said : ' i 'm available			1
i know there is a situation with my contract and i do n't know if i 'm going to get the opportunity to play again			2
' i 'm ready and i want to , but i know other things have to happen to be back			2
' what i can do is work hard and to be ready if the situation changes			0
' @entity26 is unsure whether @entity0 will be ready to return to the first team before the end of the season @entity1 fans are desperate to see the popular winger at @entity31 just one more time before he leaves at the end of the season			1
@entity0 has been building fitness with the club 's reserve team since being given the all - clear from testicular cancer for the second time in november			1
he told @entity38 last month that it was his ' dream ' to play again for @entity1 , but that is looking increasingly unlikely			2
head coach @entity26 said : ' a little bit of it ( whether he will play again ) is in his hands			2
the @entity10 is a favourite with the @entity1 fans , who would love to see him play for the club again ' he can play ( for the reserves ) , but you know when you 're ready to go at @entity5 level			1
i am waiting for the right time and it 's not right at the moment			0
i can see that on the training ground			0
' he has come back from a serious situation and i 'm not putting any pressure on him			0
' i do n't know ( if he will play again )			0
i 'd like to think so			0
it 's got to be right			0
he 's got to get in the team , in his position			0
he has to compete to get on the left hand side and there is a lot of competition there , more than we 've had for a long time			0
' the best @entity0 can perhaps hope for is an emotional cameo at the end of the season , especially as there is likely to be little riding on @entity1 's final few matches			1
@entity26 was handed the @entity1 job until the end of the season but is yet to impress the fans of that prospect , @entity26 said : ' at this moment in time it 's too early to say that			1
let 's see what happens as we get towards the end of the season			0
' one factor complicating the situation slightly is that @entity0 has a clause in his contract which , after eight appearances this season , would trigger an extension to his deal			2
the club will not allow that to happen but fans are still hopeful of them affording him a farewell outing			0
in the meantime , @entity0 's next appearance in black and white is likely to be a week on monday when the under - 21s entertain @entity102 at @entity31 .			1
