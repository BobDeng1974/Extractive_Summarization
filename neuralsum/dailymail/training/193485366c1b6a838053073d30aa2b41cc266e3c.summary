for nearly a decade in the 1980s , the nation learned of the day ’s events from her clipped tones and clear elocution			0
but former newsreader @entity5 admits the diction of actors and presenters has become so poor , she has to rely on subtitles to understand modern television			1
and writing in today ’s @entity11 , she called on broadcasters to enrol their young stars on courses to improve their spoken @entity15			1
former @entity16 newsreader @entity5 , pictured , said the quality of diction on tv has declined dramatically miss @entity5 , 72 , who spent seven years as a newsreader for the @entity16 , writes : ‘ there ’s been a noticeable rise in poor diction on tv over the last decade and it ’s getting worse			1
it ’s particularly evident among younger actors and presenters who , infuriatingly , so often swallow or do n’t end their words			0
‘ the solution , i believe , is for tv networks to enrol today ’s young presenters on courses to help them speak with greater clarity			2
i ’m not calling for them to be made to recite phrases like “ how now , brown cow ” , as in the past – but simply to be taught clear enunciation and voice projection			0
‘ after all , they ’re in the communication business so , to put it bluntly , do n’t they have a duty to make themselves understood by viewers ? ’ miss @entity5 , whose father enrolled her in speech and drama classes as a child to neutralise her south - east @entity50 accent , denies her age has anything to do with her difficulty hearing			1
she said : ‘ i can hear the kitchen cat flap go from my sitting room			0
but all too often i find myself switching on the subtitles in order to understand the @entity15			1
’ miss @entity5 praised @entity59 news anchor @entity58 , pictured , for his ability to read the news the former presenter , who has been married five times , refused to name newsreaders she believes fail to speak as clearly as they should – although she did single out @entity65 anchor @entity58 for praise – but is concerned there are some who ‘ put the emphasis on the wrong words when reading a bulletin			1
’ this is not the first time the pronunciation of modern television stars has come in for criticism			2
earlier this year , actors in @entity16 dramas @entity78 and @entity80 were accused of mumbling their lines and that their thick accents were impenetrable			1
with the former programme attracting nearly 2,200 complaints from disgruntled viewers			0
and in an interview last year , @entity16 director - general @entity86 said : ‘ i do n’t want to sound like a grumpy old man , but i also think muttering is something we could have a look at			2
‘ actors muttering can be testing			0
you find you have missed a line			0
you have to remember you have an audience			0
’ miss @entity5 , who presented the @entity97 , also singled out television actors for particular criticism			1
she recounted how she recently watched a comedy where half the parts were played by theatre actors and the other half by soap stars			2
she said : ‘ we understood the theatre actors perfectly but not the soap actresses , as they neither projected or enunciated			0

@entity5 *claimed* she watches tv with subtitles to see what *'s* being said
miss @entity5 said young stars need to improve their spoken @entity15
the @entity16 was *heavily* criticised over dramas @entity80 and @entity78
