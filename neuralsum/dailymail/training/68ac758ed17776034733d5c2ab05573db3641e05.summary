incredibly , the mix up appears to have taken place because staff at @entity16 branch said the girl ’s mother looked like the addict , and so got the medications confused			1
the girl , who should have been prescribed an antibiotic , had six doses of the addict ’s methadone before the mistake was uncovered and she was taken to hospital for treatment			2
details of the mistake were revealed in information released by the @entity32 under @entity34 laws			0
the mix - up took place when the child ’s mother went into the 24 hour branch of boots to collect a repeat prescription of @entity42 , an antibiotic commonly used to treat children ’s chest infections			1
but staff at the chemist appeared to mistake the mother for an addict who regularly picked up her methadone prescription from the same branch			1
instead of giving the mother the antibiotic , staff at the branch handed over the powerful heroin substitute , which has strict guidelines about how it should be dispensed			2
later the same day , the addict arrived at the @entity5 branch to collect her methadone but a different pharmacist refused to hand it over , saying their records showed it had already been given out			1
the report says that the mother then gave her daughter 5ml doses of methadone believing the medicine was the antibiotic her daughter had previously been prescribed			1
by the time the blunder was uncovered the child had taken 30g of methadone in a total of six 5ml doses			2
she was taken to hospital where medical staff cared for her while the effects of the drug wore off			1
the blunder in 2011 sparked a ‘ @entity86 ’ report which was sent to @entity16			0
a summary says : ‘ the pharmacist and the pharmacy should have followed the @entity5 standard operating procedures for dispensing medication			2

if a person takes too much methadone it can cause drowsiness , confusion , a weak pulse , weak breathing and fainting			0
