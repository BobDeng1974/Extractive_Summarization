by @entity0 when little @entity2 , three , blushed and turned bashfully into her father @entity3 's shoulder upon coming face to face with the @entity6 yesterday , hearts melted all over the world			1
but her shyness came as a surprise to @entity3 who says that not only is @entity2 not normally particularly timid , she actually thought the @entity6 was very beautiful			1
' she can be shy sometimes , ' says the professional sailor , 40 , from @entity14			1
' but after she met the @entity15 , she said she thought the @entity6 was beautiful and lovely			1
she 's very nice - she 's just got that charm			0
' but while @entity2 's day might have ended on a high note , no one was smiling more than her father , for whom winning the @entity26 for @entity27 is a long - cherished dream			1
' for a sailor , it 's the pinnacle , ' he enthuses			0
' i grew up in a sailing family and it was always about the @entity26			2
' the real rockstars of my sport were doing it and i never thought that it might be me one day , but when i got the opportunity to take part in 2003 , i jumped at it			1
' unfortunately , his first taste of the @entity26 ended with @entity43 crashing out in the quarter final after losing to @entity47 catamaran @entity45			2
job done : despite her nerves , @entity2 managed to complete the job and hand the @entity15 her summer posy @entity53 plans : sir @entity54 and the @entity6 pose with the @entity26 in @entity20 yesterday proud father : sailor @entity56 has raced in the @entity26 but is yet to take home the trophy that , however , will make victory taste all the sweeter should @entity3 , and his colleague sir @entity54 , take home the trophy in 2017			1
' if you read through early history of the @entity26 , brits were so often there in the final and it 's good to remember that , ' he enthuses			0
' winning it in 2017 really would be one for the history books and i think we 've got technology and sailors here that are as good as anyone else 's			0
' known affectionately as the ' @entity26 ' , the @entity26 was first offered as a prize by @entity80 in 1851 , who volunteered to present it to the winner of a sailing race around the @entity84			0
after a schooner named @entity86 from @entity87 took the trophy , which was made especially for the race by jewellers @entity91 , the cup was renamed in its honour , and both trophy and race have carried the moniker ever since			0
despite its @entity27 origins , the cup has never been taken by a @entity27 team , with the @entity47 's clinging on tenaciously to dominate the victor 's roll of honour , although @entity104 and @entity105 teams have triumphed in the past			0
' a lot of good men have tried and failed to win it , ' adds @entity110 of the reasons the cup has lasted so long is because it 's so hard to win			0
' ' if you do win it , then you can take it home and you own it completely , which means you can then rewrite the rules and stack the decks in your favour , making it hard for anyone to take it from you			0
' almost : @entity56 and @entity43 see off an @entity126 boat in 2003 but crashed out in the quarter final sailing fan : the duchess on an @entity26 catamaran in @entity132 harbour where the 2003 race took place one team which has done exactly that is current holders @entity137 , a @entity138 outfit that has held the @entity26 since 2010 , and were helped to victory last year by none other than sir @entity54			1
whether this year 's contenders , @entity142 , can manage to wrest it from them is yet to be decided but @entity3 thinks @entity27 should be in with a good shout come 2017			2
' in recent years , sailing has n't had much support because it is n't a mainstream sport but we 've got a great opportunity with @entity54 [ @entity151 ] on board and that should give the bid a boost			2
' in the meantime , he 's working with @entity151 to get more supporters on side for the 2017 bid for victory and says he is thrilled by the amount of attention yesterday 's launch garnered			0
' @entity15 ' involvement helped straight away in the obvious sense that it 's already getting more attention , ' he enthuses			0
team : @entity3 ( right ) is competing alongside sir @entity54 in the @entity169 2014 @entity170 : sir @entity54 lifts the @entity26 after winning with @entity137 last year in @entity138 hopeful : sir @entity54 is fronting @entity27 's bid for an @entity26 winning team in 2017 all smiles : @entity175 of @entity176 with the posy of summer flowers given to her by @entity2 ' it 's all been very positive			1
it 's also very much about being @entity27 and doing this for the @entity183 - we want to get the support of the country if we can and having the @entity6 on board really helps			1
' but while he 's looking forward to getting back on his catamaran and competing in another @entity26 race , he 's got another sailing fan to heave to with first - his small daughter @entity2			1
' i took her out for the first time the other day and i was almost more excited than her , ' he beams			0
' if she turned around one day and said , " @entity197 , i want to be a sailor too " , then i 'd be very pleased			0
' i do n't think i 'd push them too hard [ @entity2 and her brother @entity200 , one ] but i 'd give them all the support i could and i 'd tell her that if you work as hard as you can , then you can achieve a lot in this sport			2
' for @entity3 and fellow sailor sir @entity54 , the next few years could prove very hard work indeed but the rewards for them - and for @entity27 - could be just as impressive			1
