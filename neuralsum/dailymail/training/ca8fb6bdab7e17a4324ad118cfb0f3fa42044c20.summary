he added to @entity276 : ' because of corner cutting and an ingrained cultural attitude by management of " we make do with less , " the @entity12 is not protecting the @entity3 with adequate agents and uniformed officers and is not keeping up to date with the latest devices for detecting intruders and weapons of mass destruction ' @entity273 — who revealed the embarrassing scandal about @entity12 agents hiring prostitutes in @entity289 — said it 's ' arrogance ' that the @entity3 does n't even have a front door lock			1
' if the intruder were carrying chemical , biological or radiological weapons and president @entity35 and his family had been in , we would have had a dead president as well as a dead first family , ' said @entity273 , who authored ' @entity300 : secret service agents reveal the @entity302 of the presidents			2
