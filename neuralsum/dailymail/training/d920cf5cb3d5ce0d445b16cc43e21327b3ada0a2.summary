it 's been a strange weekend : @entity1 put out a team that got a great away win by playing some terrific football , reminiscent of @entity5 circa 2004			1
meantime @entity6 put out a team that got a great away win by playing some functional , effective football reminiscent of @entity10 circa 2005			1
i know which i prefer			0
@entity1 has replaced his old functional football at @entity10 with something far more spectacular @entity15 celebrates one of his two goals in @entity10 's 5 - 0 rout of @entity19 on saturday @entity20 , who also scored two goals at the @entity23 , celebrates with striker @entity15 after scoring i wrote this about @entity1 in my book is he all that ? ( available in pound shops up and down the country ) : ' it 's impossible to knock @entity1 's winning habit … ( but ) his style is rigid and formulaic			1
sometimes it 's labelled negative and defensive			0
' it was right at the time , but even those more critical of @entity1 than myself must surely now stand back and admire the change in this manager , and the style of his current @entity10 team			1
i have been to see @entity10 on numerous occasions this season			0
there is of course that defensive efficiency with which @entity1 's teams are synonymous ( it went awol at @entity46 ) , but further up the field things have changed			1
in his first spell at @entity10 he had a goalscoring midfielder in @entity52 and an out - and - out striker in @entity54 , but the rest were asked by the manager to be defenders			2
@entity1 was successful during his first spell in charge at @entity10 - but the football was n't attractive @entity1 's insistence on playing a defensive style infuriated big - name signings like @entity64 @entity65 was criticised by @entity1 for not having enough defensive discipline in a win at @entity68 in 2005 this is why players like @entity64 became frustrated			1
the @entity72 said this after leaving @entity1 's @entity74 : ' he puts out a winning team , it does not matter if it 's done with nice football or not			1
' further evidence is when @entity65 scored the winner against @entity79 in 2005			0
@entity1 said this in his post-match interview : ' i needed 11 players for my defensive organization , but i had just 10			2
@entity65 … has to improve when the team needs him to be part of a defensive organization			0
i made the trip to @entity90 at the weekend to see a decent @entity19 side ripped to shreds by some spectacular , sensational , sexy @entity10 football			2
@entity1 's players did their defending when out of possession of course , and @entity19 were n't at their best , but @entity10 were a joy to watch			1
@entity98 is congratulated by @entity99 after scoring @entity10 's fifth goal at the @entity101 @entity15 fires home @entity10 's second goal at @entity19 following a dazzling move how @entity10 's movement and passing unpicked the @entity19 defence in a matter of seconds for 2 - 0 it was n't functional , it was n't formulaic			1
it was bright , it was pleasing on the eye , and at the risk of enraging @entity1 , dare i say , it was like watching @entity116 's @entity115 at their peak			2
@entity10 led 4 - 0 at half - time with some stunning flowing football and some wonderfully crafted goals			1
it could have been six or seven at the break			0
take the second goal : when @entity124 receives the ball around 35 yards out , there are nine @entity19 players between him and the goal			0
four passes and less than six seconds later , @entity15 has hit the back of the net			0
they eased off after the interval but still scored a brilliant goal in which @entity134 sparkled during the build - up			0
he wo n't like being called the new @entity6 , he 'll hate being labelled as the next @entity116 , but @entity1 is certainly a manager reborn			2
@entity6 stormed the @entity136 on sunday and watched @entity5 win ugly against @entity137			0

@entity10 played wonderful football in their 5 - 0 rout of @entity19 on saturday
@entity1 has cast aside the functional style of his first spell
the manager now has his team playing spectacular football
the defensive rigour of @entity1 's old teams remains in evidence
but going *forward* they are a much more exciting *proposition*
