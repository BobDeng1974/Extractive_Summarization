miss @entity2 , who has divided mothers with her ultra-strict advice , insists difficult parents must be taught the importance of ‘ boundaries ’ and be treated with a ‘ fair but firm ’ hand			1
she told the @entity26 : ‘ applying good boundaries to a pushy parent is just as necessary as applying good boundaries to a demanding child			2
‘ a pushy or demanding parent needs to understand that he or she ca n’t fundamentally alter the way the school operates			2
