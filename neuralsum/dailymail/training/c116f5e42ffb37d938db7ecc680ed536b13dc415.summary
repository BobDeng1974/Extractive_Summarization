failed bid : @entity2 staff remove a man hidden in a lorry in the @entity6 port of @entity7 tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and failed asylum seekers were allowed to stay in the @entity12 without proper checks in yet another borders scandal , it emerged last night			1
a government inspector found that thousands of foreign nationals were granted an ‘ amnesty ’ without their files even being looked at			1
officials at the shambolic @entity2 ( @entity2 ) also ignored evidence of deception and fraud by applicants whose cases dated back up to 17 years			1
some 124,000 cases were put in cold storage without proper checks to see if the applicant could be found			1
it has since emerged 37,500 people involved could have been easily located and potentially booted out			0
a further 10,000 cases classified as having ‘ legal barriers to removal ’ had , in fact , just never been opened			0
officials also repeatedly misled @entity34 over what was happening , according to @entity36 , the chief inspector of @entity37			1
the grave charge has infuriated mps and could trigger a new inquiry by the home affairs select committee			0
its chairman , @entity42 , said last night : ‘ this is a devastating report			0
the failure to properly check asylum cases means @entity2 is in danger of overseeing an effective amnesty for many of them			1
' the failure to properly check asylum cases means @entity2 is in danger of overseeing an effective amnesty for many of them ' home affairs select committee chairman @entity42 ‘ it appears that senior officials of the @entity2 have misled the committee about facts and figures			1
to mislead a committee of the @entity62 is an extremely serious matter			0
on the basis of this report , they should hand them back immediately			0
’ one official who gave false information to the committee , @entity71 , has since been promoted to chief executive at @entity73 on £ 175,000 a year			0
mr @entity36 ’s explosive report lays bare the incompetence and confusion which took hold in the @entity78 when 450,000 historic claims were unearthed by former home secretary @entity80 in 2006			0
a deadline of april 2011 was set to clear the so - called legacy backlog , which involved 500,000 files			2
' devastating report ' : officials at the @entity2 ignored evidence of deception and fraud by applicants whose cases dated back up to 17 years the @entity91 has repeatedly highlighted how a huge number of the applications were being rubber - stamped			1
mr @entity36 ’s report puts a final figure on the number officially given asylum under this amnesty – an astonishing 172,000			2
but he also reveals what happened to the tens of thousands of cases where @entity2 officials insisted the applicants could not be found			1
in november 2010 , then agency chief executive miss @entity71 told @entity103 that 100,000 cases were put in a controlled archive only after a ‘ significant number of checks ’			2
miss @entity71 left the agency in january 2011			0
' we have known for some time that @entity2 is a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery ' @entity78 spokesman in april that year , acting chief executive @entity113 told the home affairs committee that each controlled archive case had been checked ‘ against 19 databases – @entity117 , @entity78 , private sector databases ’			1
but a sample of cases examined by mr @entity36 found that just 4 per cent had been subject to external checks			1
in the months leading up to april 2011 , cases were put in the archive on the basis that no trace could be found of the asylum seeker			2
but , the report found , in many such cases that was simply because officials in the unit processing them – the @entity133 – had not opened the post to find letters from lawyers			1
in april 2011 , the remaining cases were moved to the @entity138 and @entity139 , based in @entity140 , which quickly became ‘ overwhelmed ’			0
it took on 147,000 cases , with fewer that 100 staff			0
such was the chaos that 150 boxes of post were found unopened in the new unit			2
in the following months , vast numbers of cases were fast - tracked , with just 13 per cent of applicants refused the right to remain here			2
some were allowed to stay despite ‘ multiple examples of deception ’ and even imprisonment for fraud			2
' shambles ' : a government inspector found thousands of foreign nationals were granted an ' amnesty ' by the @entity2 without their files even being looked at case workers routinely granted migrants the right to stay under @entity164 of the @entity165 because they had been here so long , and applicants ’ statements were accepted at face value			1
there was , the report said , ‘ little evidence in a number of cases to demonstrate that they were being considered on their individual merits ’			0
in a desperate bid to clear the cases , managers allowed case workers to grant the right to stay without even opening the file			2
some 3,750 cases were decided this way			0
of the controlled archive cases examined by the inspectors , on average they were not dealt with for more than seven years and one was not opened for 17 years			0
once external checks were finally carried out this year , 31,000 migrants whose cases had been archived were ‘ found ’			1
even now , many individuals are not being chased down immediately because of ‘ insufficient resources ’			0
mr @entity36 said : ‘ i found that updates given by the agency to @entity34 in the summer of 2011 , stating that the legacy of unresolved asylum cases was resolved , were inaccurate			1
’ a @entity78 spokesman said : ‘ we have known for some time that @entity2 is a troubled organisation with a poor record of delivery			1
turning the agency around will take time , but we are making progress			0
’ @entity203 's analysis five years ago , when the @entity91 revealed on its front page that ‘ as many as 165,000 asylum seekers are to be granted an “ amnesty ” to live in @entity12 ’ , there were howls of protest from the @entity78			1
officials insisted it was nothing of the sort and that each and every case would be judged exhaustively on its merits , while the pro-immigration lobby dismissed the 165,000 figure as ‘ scare - mongering ’			2
today , we discover the truth			0
of 479,000 historic cases considered by the @entity78 under the so - called ‘ legacy exercise ’ , 172,000 have been granted asylum , while only 37,500 people have been removed			2
a further 268,000 files were bundled into a category marked ‘ other ’			0
in some cases the files were duplicates , but more than 100,000 applications were flung into what officials called a ‘ controlled archive ’			1
as today ’s report reveals , it was anything but ‘ controlled ’ – with few or no checks being carried out to trace the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers involved			1
thousands of people – including criminals and people who told blatant lies on their asylum claims – are walking the streets years after they should have been kicked out			0
over-stretched staff were rubber - stamping thousands of claims to stay without even opening the paper files			1
@entity2 staff dealt with the backlog of cases so inefficiently that at one point 100,000 pieces of post from lawyers , mps and others were unopened			2
as an exercise in incompetence , it can hardly be bettered			0
but to make matters worse we now learn how @entity78 officials repeatedly misled @entity34 over the scale of the scandal			1
checks which mps were assured had taken place simply did not happen.and the official who presided over much of this shambles ? @entity71 , the one - time £ 200,000 - a - year head of the @entity2 , has not been dismissed or even disciplined			1
indeed , she has been promoted to chief executive and permanent secretary of the @entity73 – which collects the tax required for the country to function			0
chancellor @entity275 should be very afraid .			0

@entity2 allowed tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to remain in @entity12 without proper checks
thousands of foreign nationals were granted an ' amnesty ' without their files being looked at
officials also repeatedly misled @entity34 over what was happening , a government inspector found
