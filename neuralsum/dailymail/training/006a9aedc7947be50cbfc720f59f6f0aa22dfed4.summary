the @entity0 has a children ’s website filled with characters that give the agency a saturday morning cartoon feel			1
@entity6 comes replete with a buck - toothed rabbit , an @entity9 fatigued - wearing bald eagle and a turtle wearing a backwards ball cap and sunglasses who thinks coding is ‘ kewl			0
’ the site launched in 2005 , but the @entity16 brought into the broader consciousness saturday after revelations made by former contractor @entity19 have cast an unfavorable light on the spy agency			1
@entity6 : the @entity0 's website targeted at the future spies of @entity24 ‘ in the world of diplomacy , knowing what your enemy is planning helps you to prepare , ’ the turtle joyfully says			1
‘ but it is also important that your enemies do not know what you have planned			0
’ children entering the site are treated to loading pages out of the late 1990s that say ‘ decrypting information ’ whenever clicking on different sections			1
