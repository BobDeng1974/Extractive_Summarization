by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 @entity2 has warned of a testing start to @entity5 's season and believes his seven summer signings should be afforded time to adapt to the @entity8			1
the @entity9 kick off their campaign at home to champions @entity12 on sunday with the manager under pressure to return on a £ 40million close - season investment by owner @entity16			1
in his last game at @entity19 was subject to howls of disapproval from supporters who had seen their side lose 14 of 19 matches			2
ready to go : @entity5 players train ahead of their season opener against @entity12 but the 53 - year - old survived and will return to the @entity29 in front of a sell - out crowd			1
only then will we be able to gauge the forgiveness precipitated by the arrival of players such as @entity37 midfielder @entity36 , @entity39 captain @entity38 and @entity42 right - back @entity40			2
@entity2 , though , is guarded against promising an instant return			1
' i do n't like setting targets myself with the team , ' he said			2
' what we do also need to understand - and i know people are saying it 's desperate that i need a fast start after what happened at the back end of last year – is that i think that 's going to be difficult because we have got a lot of new players			2
' so i am kind of preparing myself for an even start , if i am honest , and to get stronger as we go along			0
' good business : @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 ( right ) are among the players signed by @entity2 top acquisition : summer signing @entity36 is expected to play a major role for @entity5 this season @entity2 is happy with the make - up of his squad and has publicly thanked @entity16 for sticking by him after the trials of last season			1
there remains the chance of a late move for @entity72 's @entity71 – who scored 14 times on loan at @entity5 last season – but the boss is confident that goals already reside in his team			1
@entity2 's side failed to score in 13 of their final 21 matches last time around , but he said : ' we have had some good strikers here - @entity82 ( @entity83 ) had that fabulous year and @entity84			1
since i have been here they have been terrific , and @entity71 , obviously , last year on loan			0
' i do think that we have got one or two players in that dressing room who can emulate those guys			0
to emulate @entity91 or @entity92 , i think that 's a bit tougher , but those recent guys we have had , i think so , yes			0
' @entity96 – a £ 6m signing from @entity97 - will lead the line against @entity12			1
he outscored @entity99 and @entity100 last season after netting 13 times , mainly from the bench			0
stand by me : @entity2 is delighted with the way @entity5 owner @entity16 has backed him this summer and @entity2 is confident the 24 - year - old can prove to be his next big goalscoring hit on @entity108			1
' i think he 's a player that was stuck at @entity97 behind some unbelievable footballers , ' he said of the former @entity37 under - 21 forward			0
' all he could was come on to the pitch and score if he got the chance , and he did that , so he did n't do too much wrong there			0
' we 're fairly fortunate to have him and we think he 's a player who can grow			0
' i like his attitude and he 's hungry with a good mentality			0
he 's a different type of player to @entity82			0
' i just hope everything falls for him at the football club			0
i have been fairly successful here with strikers and hopefully he will be a success too			0
' @entity2 will certainly be hoping that proves the case			1
for while he has tried to temper expectation by reminding fans of his new - look team , memory of the old one still lingers			2
to that end , @entity2 needs to start well , for ' even ' – as the manager has predicted - might not be enough to pacify some supporters .			1

@entity5 kick off their campaign at home to champions @entity12
@entity2 wants fans to be *patient* with his seven summer *recruits*
manager is happy with the *financial* backing from owner @entity16
