@entity0 will ban bosses employing regular staff on zero - hours contracts for any longer than 12 weeks			1
@entity4 said it was ' not good enough ' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next			2
he said a @entity0 government would give workers the right to demand a ' regular contract if they do regular hours ' after three months			1
in an interview with @entity25 this morning , mr @entity4 said : ' if it 's not good enough for us , i do n't think it is good enough for the people of @entity31 , and that 's why we have got to make this change			2
' mr @entity4 said there had been an ' epidemic ' of zero - hours contracts under the @entity37 and dismissed fears scrapping them could force companies to lay off staff			1
it is estimated there are now 1.8million contracts in the @entity31 that do not guarantee any hours – with as many as one in seven jobs now zero - hours			2
@entity48 data shows that 58 per cent of people on zero - hours contracts have been with their current employer for over a year , and that workers on the contracts work 23 hours a week on average			1
mr @entity4 said workers should be given the right after 12 weeks to demand ' a regular contract if they do regular hours '			1
he said : ' i think it goes right to the heart of the election campaign			0
i do n't believe we can build a successful country when working people are facing that kind of insecurity			0
' there is an issue about the number of hours , but there is also an issue about the unpredictability of the hours			0
that 's the insecurity people face			0
' the @entity0 leader arrived in @entity76 this morning for a question and answer session with workers on the second full - day of the campaign he said most businesses did not use zero - hours contracts , but added : ' the trouble is for some businesses this has become the primary way that they employ people and i do n't think it 's the right way forward for our country			1
' zero hour contracts are just one example of the insecurity of our economy and what has happened over the last five years			0
@entity21 says it has all been a great success – i 'll let the @entity31 people be the judge of that			0
' the @entity104 have already announced that it would ban exclusivity clauses which stop staff on zero - hours contracts from working for other companies			1
under @entity0 's plan , workers will also be entitled to compensation if shifts are cancelled at short notice			2
the proposal goes well beyond the recommendations made by the former @entity117 exec @entity116 in an independent review for @entity0			2
he said workers should have a right to request a regular contract after six months ' continuous employment and to be given one after 12 months			1
critics have warned that company bosses could dismiss staff just before the right to a full contract kicks in			0
it also risks undermining @entity31 's flexible labour market which economists claim is behind the recent jobs boom			0
@entity23 grilled @entity21 over the number of zero - hours contracts in the @entity31 workforce but mr @entity4 told @entity0 activists later today : ' the problem of zero - hours contracts is at the heart of the key question in this election : who does our country work for ? ' does it work just for the rich and the powerful ? or does it work for working people – the people looking for a job , trying to find enough money to support a family , to make ends meet ? ' @entity154 , of the @entity155 said zero - hours contracts were used by just ' 2 per cent of workers ' which he said could ' hardly be described as an epidemic '			1
he added : ' nobody supports the misuse of these contracts , but demonising and ultimately outlawing them will simply risk jobs and undermine a labour market that has made us the envy of @entity168			0
' @entity169 , @entity170 director - general , added : ' the @entity31 's flexible jobs market has given us an employment rate that is the envy of other countries , so proposals to limit flexible contracts to 12 weeks are wide of the mark			0
' of course action should be taken to tackle abuses , but demonising flexible contracts is playing with the jobs that many firms and many workers value and need			0
' these proposals run the risk of a return to day - to - day hiring in parts of the economy , with lower stability for workers and fewer opportunities for people to break out of low pay			2
' but @entity195 general secretary @entity194 said ' we need a fairer system that guarantees zero - hours workers decent rights at work and stops them from being treated like second - class employees			1

@entity0 leader said it 's ' not good enough ' for staff not to have regular pay
he said workers should get the right to a regular contract after 3 months
comes after the @entity212 struggled to say if he could live on zero - hours contract
