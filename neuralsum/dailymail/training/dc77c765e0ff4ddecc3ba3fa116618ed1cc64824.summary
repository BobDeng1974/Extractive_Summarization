' if nothing has been achieved and this kind of thing is going on among the police who are meant to be responsible for law and order then everyone who has lost their lives has done so for nothing			0
' it begs the question that will be at the back of the minds of all those who lost someone in @entity47 ... did our loved ones lose their lives in vain ? ' the documentary casts doubt on defence chiefs claims the handover is on track mrs @entity77 said she was ' pleased ' the failings of the police had been exposed and questioned the need for @entity6 troops to ever have become involved in @entity47			1

' ' it 's vast , ' he said , ' everything from skimming ammunition off their supplies to skimming fuel off their shipments			0
