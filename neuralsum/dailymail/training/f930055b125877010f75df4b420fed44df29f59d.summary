mr @entity3 , who is currently an mep , has said that he will run for @entity18 at the general election in 2015			1
but sources in @entity5 have privately revealed that he also covets a seat in the upper house			2
in an interview with @entity24 , mr @entity3 joked that that become a peer ‘ sounds a bit respectable does n’t it , very , very worrying ’			0
but he added : ‘ what i will say that it ’s an absolute outrage that we have n’t been offered any peerages for the party already			2
‘ @entity13 blathers on about wanting a @entity8 that represents the way people in this country vote , well crikey @entity40 , we ’ve been offered nothing , it just goes to show , does n’t it ? ’ in the wide - ranging interview mr @entity3 admitted that his party has suffered in the past because it resembled a ‘ rugby club ’ and did not include enough women			1
he said : ‘ i think at its worst @entity5 has looked a bit like the rugby club on a day out ’ where the priority was to ‘ go off and have some fun -- we ’ve been a bit guilty of that			1
‘ we also , in the early days , just did n’t have many able women in the party , or able women who had the time to give to politics			0
that ’s changed completely and if you look at the @entity67 election list for next year , the women dominate it			0
’ mr @entity3 attacked @entity13 over his desire to want a @entity8 that represents the way people vote without any @entity5 members mr @entity3 said @entity5 would run candidates at every seat in 2015 but also suggested @entity5 would be prepared to endorse individual conservative mps who were prepared to call for an in - out referendum before the election			1
never say never : the @entity5 leader made clear he would not want to work with @entity13 if @entity5 won seats in @entity80 in 2015 , but said he would not rule it out @entity13 has pledged to hold a referendum in 2017 after re-negotiating @entity9 ’s relationship with @entity84			1

mr @entity3 said : ‘ i think there will be discussions at local level and let ’s see what happens			0
i think there are some people in the parliament who are on the right lines			0
when we do finally get the vote on the @entity103 amendment it will actually clarify things rather nicely			0
’ the @entity5 leader made clear he would not want to work with @entity13 if @entity5 won seats in @entity80 in 2015 , but said he would not rule it out			1
he said : ‘ it ’s pretty stupid in life to come up and say that you would never do something			0
i could say to you i ’ll never , ever jump out of that window , but you know what , if that was on fire and the option was burning to death or jumping out of the window , i ’d jump out of the window			0
‘ i ’d have thought @entity13 would rather go to his political grave rather than ever contemplate doing a deal with the ghastly @entity5 - that ’s my judgment , i could be wrong			1
’ mr @entity3 said he would rather work with @entity124 mayor @entity123 or education secretary @entity125 if they were @entity128 leader			1
‘ i ’ve always said i think @entity125 ’s an approachable , open - minded , interesting , intelligent politician who understands that different people have different points of view and that it can be actually quite acceptable to hold other points of view , ’ he said			2
working partnership : mr @entity3 said he would be happy to work alongside @entity123 or @entity125 if they were to become @entity128 leader ‘ @entity123 is obviously a fascinating character			1
one thinks that his instincts are closer to ours than they are to mr @entity13 ’s			2

’ mr @entity3 said he expects to be frozen out of tv leadership debates at the next election but plans to sabotage them by broadcasting his own response to the words of mr @entity13 , mr @entity142 and @entity152			2
he said : ‘ i think that if @entity5 has good cause to think that it should be in the tv debates and it ’s excluded we will provide an alternative form of entertainment on the evening			2
‘ people would have their tvs and their laptops next to it			0
they might think they can exclude us but modern technology has such a power			0
