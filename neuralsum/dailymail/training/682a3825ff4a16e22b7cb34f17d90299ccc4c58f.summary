mr @entity35 obtained a previously classified letter from that shows the @entity28 suspected the scientist of having communist sympathies			1

a new book claims that @entity19 escaped to @entity31 after @entity25 tipped off the @entity23 , who in turn tipped off the @entity1 physicist , that the scientist was being investigated by the @entity20 for communist activities ' one might imagine that the failure to find the [ @entity20 ] letters occurred because he had destroyed the evidence , ' mr @entity35 said			1
' it 's 99.9 per cent certain that @entity25 would then have informed [ the @entity23 ]			0
' the letter appears in mr @entity35 's new book @entity78 : the divided life of @entity0			2

a new book , written by scientist @entity35 ( above ) , suggests @entity1 nuclear physicist @entity0 defected from the @entity8 to the @entity2 after being tipped off by double agent @entity25 mr @entity35 said the family flew from @entity91 to @entity31 via @entity92 and @entity93			1
he added : ' in @entity93 , they were in two cars and his father was in the trunk of one car			0
[ the son ] said , in a huge understatement , " i knew something was up			0
