along with the sex change operation @entity39 also had facial reconstruction surgery to create a softer female jawline and nose			1
miss @entity39 , who has applied to have a gender and first name changed legally , said : ' i ’ve always wanted to be a woman			2
but i was too ashamed to admit it			0
eventually i could n’t hide who i was			0
' at first i was worried about how my police colleagues would react to the news but so far the reception has been great			2
prominent : miss @entity39 , pictured before her surgery , leads a police department in @entity14 ' very macho ' : colleagues spoke of her surprise at @entity39 's decision in light of her previous professional persona ' i have n’t received a negative comment from any of the people i work with			1
in fact , everyone is treating me as if nothing has happened , she told @entity3 newspaper @entity65			0
she has worked for the @entity67 state civil police force for over four years , first in the special narcotics division and then as the head of a division in @entity14			1
@entity71 , deputy general delegate of @entity67 civil police , said : ' we see @entity21 ’s personal decision as an act of bravery , ' said ' for us , her case is not an issue			1
we are more concerned about tackling the corruption , violence and negligent behaviour of some of our police officers , ' said the senior officer			2
' @entity21 has always been a valued and respected member of the corporation and this does n’t change just because she has undergone surgery			1
she will continue to be employed in the same position that she held as @entity9			2

i think he will have a difficult time settling back into the job dressed as a woman with a female name			0
' another who remembered her time as coordinator of the special narcotics investigative team , said : ' the chief was fearless in times of danger demonstrating his strength and courage as a man when facing killers and drug dealers			0
i remember he even had a beard at one stage			0

home turf : miss @entity39 is an officer in the city of @entity14 , in north - western @entity3 ' a number of us knew he was gay , it was an open secret but not something widely discussed especially as he was such a tough cop and someone you did n’t mess with , ' said one			1
@entity186 a senior police officer with the @entity67 force said : ' unfortunately , we still have to live with the fact that some police officers will be shocked and make jokes when they meet @entity21 , but we preach tolerance and democracy			1

we are trying to change attitudes internally so that police officer ’s behaviour improves not only towards colleagues who are homosexual but most importantly towards the general public			1
