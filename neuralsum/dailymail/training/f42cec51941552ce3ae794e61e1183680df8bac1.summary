by @entity1 - squire as they shop for clothes , @entity2 and @entity3 look like two friends simply enjoying a day out shopping			1
but @entity3 , 41 , used to be a very macho man called @entity9			1
a former soldier in the army ’s @entity12 , he once served in war - torn @entity14 and the @entity16			2
and before @entity9 became a woman , he married @entity2 in a white wedding			1
yet today , despite @entity9 ’s transition to the feminine @entity3 – she is already taking hormones and has grown b - cup breasts - the couple claim they are happier than ever together			1
the happy couple : despite the changes , @entity2 and @entity3 say they are happier than ever together they have no plans to divorce			1
in fact , mother - of - three @entity2 , 39 , who refers to @entity3 as ‘ she ’ , is helping her to live as a woman			1
' with @entity3 , i have the best of both worlds , ' said @entity2			1
' she is still the love of my life , the same person inside , but now i also have a best friend who i can talk about make up and clothes with			2
' of course i was absolutely shocked when she first told me			0
but now we are both going through the journey of her sex change together			0
i am as thrilled as she is to see her developing breasts and a new figure			0
' and @entity3 , who out of desperation to become a woman once took @entity2 ’s contraceptive pills , said : ' telling @entity2 i wanted to change sex was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done			1
it is such a relief that she is standing by me			0
' white wedding : @entity9 and @entity2 on their wedding day			1
@entity2 is now helping @entity3 to live as a woman today @entity2 and @entity3 even share a wardrobe			1
' we both have a huge passion for shoes , ' says @entity2			2
we often swap clothes – we have the same tastes			0
we both love casual clothes although @entity3 is more girly than me			1
she prefers to wear full make up every day and always has her nails perfectly manicured			0
' and @entity3 has even undergone plastic surgery to make herself look even more feminine			1
' telling @entity2 i wanted to change sex was the hardest thing i ’ve ever done			2
it is such a relief that she is standing by me ' - @entity3 the pair took out a £ 4,500 loan before @entity3 underwent plastic surgery to make her nose smaller			1
brow surgery at a cost of £ 3,500 to make @entity3 ’s forehead less prominent is also planned			1
@entity2 was just 13 when she first met @entity9 , 15 , at school			1
then , there were no signs that @entity9 was anything but masculine			2
' @entity9 was known as a tough bloke who everyone looked up to and no - one would cross , ' she says			1
' i developed quite a crush on him and for a few weeks we had a typical teenage romance with a few stolen kisses			0
' but within a few weeks @entity9 had disappeared			2
in fact he ’d gone to serve in the @entity12 , where over the next 23 years he became a @entity91 , fighting in @entity14 , @entity92 and the @entity16			1

' during these years i married and had my first son , now aged 21 , ' recalls @entity2			1
transition : @entity3 has undergone plastic surgery to make herself look more feminine			1
@entity2 also helps with her make - up ' and when that marriage ended i met someone else and went on to have two more children now aged ten and six			1
meanwhile , @entity9 also had various girlfriends and when aged 24 , also married			2
' but the couple never forgot one another			0
' @entity9 would suddenly ring out of the blue and when he was back on leave , we ’d sometimes meet up , ' she says			2
' sometimes years went by when we did n’t see one another			0
but when we did the attraction was always incredibly strong – but nothing happened because each time one of us was with someone else			0
' however , in september 2006 @entity2 suddenly got an email from @entity9 that rocked her world – confiding he wanted to become a woman			1
brave : former soldier @entity9 served in war - torn @entity14 ( pictured ) and the @entity16 @entity2 emailed back to ask if he was joking			1
' but when he sent me photos of painted nails , i knew it was for real			0
' @entity3 said : ' ever since i was a teenager i ’d always felt something was n’t right because i did n’t seem to fit with men or women but in those days there was no information about men who wanted to become women			2
so i kept any feelings to myself – there was no way i could have confided them at the time to any army colleagues			0
' we both have a huge passion for shoes			0
we often swap clothes - we have the same tastes ' - @entity143 ' i ’d always had a secret stash of women ’s clothes			1
my wife had no idea but when she went out i ’d sometimes dress up in them and just sit around the house			0
' in hindsight it was the only time i felt truly comfortable			0
after that shocking revelation the emails between @entity2 and @entity9 dwindled and for three years they lost contact			1
@entity3 admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with @entity2 forever			1
but by may 2010 @entity9 ’s 15 - year marriage had ended and when he emailed @entity2 out of the blue @entity2 ’s relationship with her youngest children ’s father was also on the rocks			1
@entity3 said : ' i ’d never been able to get @entity2 out of my mind and she ’d always been the one person i could confide in			1
' @entity2 recalls despite his revelation a few years earlier , she was thrilled to be back in touch with @entity9			1
' talking with him i realised it did n’t matter he still wanted to be a woman			0
he was my first love , a soulmate			0
i ’d never forgotten him			0
' service : @entity9 served in the @entity12 over 23 years , during which time he became a @entity91 shortly after @entity2 ’s partner moved out and she started dating @entity9			1
on @entity173 , 2011 , @entity2 made him up for the first time as a woman			2
' it was a very intimate moment and i proposed , ' she said			0
' years ago @entity9 had asked me to marry him but i turned him down because i ’d only just come out of my first marriage			2
now the time was right			0
i was delighted when he accepted			0
' within six months she moved with the children to live near @entity9 , who was still living as a man at his army base in @entity183 , @entity184			2
the pair were married in a small registry office in september 2011			0
' on our wedding day @entity9 was still as a man – and we made love as man and wife			2
no - one knew our secret but i already knew that i ’d support him through his transition			0
' shortly after @entity9 retired from the army and for the first time began dressing as a woman full time			2
she said : ' i could immediately see how much happier @entity9 was as a woman			2
as a man he was a typical quiet reserved @entity202 man but as @entity3 she was much more outgoing , chatty and relaxed			2
' the first step for @entity3 ’s transformation was to get rid of her body hair			2
' that took a whole day , ' admits @entity2			2
' and she began taking my contraceptive pills , which i ’d researched on the internet could help male to female transsexuals			0
the female hormones helped her start to grow breasts , softened her skin and thickened her hair			0
' ' talking with him i realised it did n’t matter he still wanted to be a woman			0
he was my first love , a soulmate			0
i ’d never forgotten him ' - @entity143 then the pair went shopping with @entity2 helping @entity3 choose clothes to flatter her slim 5ft 7in figure , and helping her apply make up			1
meanwhile , the couple visited the children ’s school to tell teachers about @entity3			2
' we were honest with the children – we simply told them that @entity9 felt he was a woman trapped in a man ’s body and was going to now live as a woman			0
' the school have been completely supportive and the children , who still regularly see their dad who has remarried , have accepted @entity3 , ' she says			0
despite this , @entity2 admits she and @entity3 do sometimes get some odd looks and stares when they go out together			1
' we decided it was because some of @entity3 ’s facial features were still quite masculine			0
' she had a large nose for a woman and we both decided her nose would look more feminine if she had cosmetic surgery to make it smaller			0
' happy together : @entity3 admits she worried the revelation had ruined her relationship with @entity2 forever today , instead of the pill , @entity3 now takes women ’s hormones , which @entity2 has sourced online			1
as well as breasts she has a more womanly shape with hips and a smaller waist , ' she says			0
@entity3 now hopes to undergo surgery to create bigger breasts and to be accepted onto the @entity261 waiting list for gender reassignment surgery			0
the couple admit many friends and family were initially shocked			0
' @entity9 was the last man anyone would ever imagine would want to become a woman , ' says @entity2 , ' but now people have got to know @entity3 , they are more understanding and in fact some of our friends are old army colleagues			1
' they still call @entity3 her old army nickname – @entity277 – but no - one bats an eyelid now			1
' the pair plan to stay married			0
@entity2 , who has written a book about their journey to help others , reveals : ' to me she is the same wonderful person			0
