an out - of - control satellite plummeting to @entity2 at 18,000mph could land almost anywhere this evening – excluding @entity3 , @entity0 warned tonight			1
the craft , which is the size of a bus , will break up on entering @entity2 ’s atmosphere , flinging huge chunks of metal weighing up to 350lb across hundreds of miles			2
@entity0 said it will only know two hours before impact where it will land – and even that prediction will only be accurate to the nearest 6,000 miles			1
it could be anywhere between the 57th parallel north , which crosses @entity15 at around @entity16 , and the 57th parallel south , which passes just below @entity18			0
but the @entity19 could breathe a sigh of relief today after learning the space junk will not be anywhere near its airspace when it comes down			0
@entity32 @entity31 's clip , shot in northern @entity33 , shows the 20 - year - old @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , appearing as a beaming mass of light as it careers to @entity2			0
@entity0 orbital debris scientist @entity38 admitted : ‘ we know it is going to hit somewhere between 57 north and 57 south , which covers most of the inhabited world , unfortunately			1
’ tumbling to @entity2 : images from mr @entity31 's video show the 20 - year - old @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , appearing as a beaming mass of light danger : the six - ton @entity34 will crash to @entity2 and could land in @entity15 best guess : the satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes , where billions of people live @entity55 on the falling satellite however , scientists have ruled out the @entity34 striking @entity3			1
its orbit was been altered by @entity0 deliberately to make it crash – but it is now coming down sooner than expected due to changed atmospheric conditions			1
it is falling to @entity2 at five miles per second , faster than previously thought and experts say there is a one in 3,200 chance of someone being hit by debris – more likely than getting a hole in one during a round of golf			2
the 35ft @entity0 craft , which weighs 6.5tonnes , was put into space in 1991 to monitor climate change , and ceased operations in 2005			1
the falling satellite will look like a fiery meteor shower as it begins to burn up in the atmosphere			0
it is expected to break into more than 100 pieces with most of it being destroyed before it hits the ground			2
but around 26 pieces are expected to make it through and the heaviest metal parts are expected to reach @entity2 , including titanium fuel tanks			1
@entity0 spokesman @entity86 said : ‘ anybody who finds a piece of the satellite should stay away from it and call the police and let them deal with it			1
‘ it could be very hot or it could be dangerous			0
it depends on what speed the debris is going , but it could go be going fast enough to go through a house			0
‘ we will have to wait and see if the debris creates a crater			0
if it is spherical that is possible but if it has a less regular shape it may not be going so fast			0
’ mr @entity86 added that more accurate predictions are expected throughout today and will be posted on @entity0 ’s website			1
debris routinely falls to @entity2 from space but the @entity34 will be the biggest @entity0 craft to fall uncontrolled from space in 32 years			2
in 1979 @entity111 , which was 15 times bigger , rained charred chunks on the @entity113 and western @entity114 after @entity0 said it would land in @entity115			1
in 2003 when the space shuttle @entity119 exploded upon re-entry killing its entire crew , large chunks of its shell landed across @entity122			0

@entity32 : @entity31 captured the incredible footage in @entity126 , @entity33 on his @entity129 14in @entity128 telescope junk yard in space : @entity34 is one of the thousands of objects in @entity2 orbit being tracked by @entity0 , as shown by this computer graphic			2

it ran out of fuel in 2005 and @entity0 has no idea where it will crash land
@entity0 predicts it will re-enter some time after *friday* *afternoon*
around 26 pieces will hit the *surface* , in pieces weighing up to *300* pounds
