president @entity0 declared the threat of cyber attacks by foreign agents a ' national emergency ' as he unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers in the wake of an epidemic of attacks against @entity12 networks			1
@entity0 took aim at @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 as he revealed an executive order which will allow the @entity18 to freeze or block assets of those involved in attacks on ' critical ' @entity12 computer networks			1
the announcement followed a series of high profile incidents , including a devastating attack against @entity26 , and data breaches that stole credit card or health data on tens of millions of @entity12			1
' national emergency ' : @entity0 unveiled plans to impose sanctions on hackers after an epidemic of attacks ' it ’s one of the great paradoxes of our information age — the very technologies that empower us to do great good can also be used by adversaries to inflict great harm , ' he wrote in a blog post on medium			1
@entity0 said cyber attacks - many which originate from overseas - ' pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges to the @entity12 '			1
he added it required more than ' diplomacy , law enforcement , and cooperation with other nations and the private sector ' to tackle			0
he wrote : ' it 's often hard to go after bad actors , in part because of weak or poorly enforced foreign laws , or because some governments are either unwilling or unable to crack down on those responsible			1
' @entity0 said hackers working in @entity15 and @entity14 target @entity12 's defense contractors and the systems designed to support the country 's troops , while hackers in @entity16 were targeting banks and @entity70 went after @entity26			1
@entity71 , special assistant to the president and cyber security co-ordinator , said the new sanctions would ' go after the worst of the worst of malicious cyber actors ' , while @entity0 assured people they would ' in no way target the unwitting victims of cyberattacks , ' such as people whose computers are hijacked			1
however , they did not reveal any specific targets , but officials told the @entity86 it could be used against individual hackers hired by companies or countries			0
threat : the attacks included last year 's @entity26 pictures hack - allegedly carried out by @entity70			0
pictured : the secretive state 's leader , @entity93 anger : it is said the country was unhappy about the film @entity99 ( poster , right ) , which depicted an assassination attempt against the @entity70 leader , portrayed by @entity103 ( left ) they would also not curb the freedom of the internet , @entity0 stated			2
but some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order , saying it could have unforeseen impacts			0
the order could be interpreted to target investigative reporters , said @entity113 on the privacy blog @entity115			0
' does @entity117 ' publication of secret @entity119 negotiations qualify ? does @entity122 's publication of contractors ' involvement in @entity126 hacking ? ' she wrote			0
' i 'm generally concerned about this ( order ) because of the way national emergencies have served as the justification for a lot of secret spying decisions , ' @entity113 added			0
but @entity134 of the @entity135 , a security consulting firm , said the national emergency language is appropriate			0
' the use of " national emergency ' " is reflective , i think , of the seriousness with which the administration views the problem — and that 's a good thing , ' @entity134 said on the @entity144 blog			0
' what is most notable about the order is how strongly the @entity12 is flexing its economic muscle			2
if access to @entity12 markets is of value , the administration is signalling , strongly , that continued access may be conditioned on good cyber behavior			2
concern : some privacy activists questioned the broad language in the order and its unforeseen impacts however , @entity0 's advisers were keen to stress how important the new measures were			2
@entity161 , the president 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism , wrote in a blog : ' in just the past year , we have seen a significant increase in the frequency , scale , and sophistication of cyber incidents targeting the @entity12 people , including everything from large data breaches and significant intrusions to destructive and coercive cyber attacks intended to influence the way ordinary @entity12 exercise their constitutional rights			1
' in many cases , these threats stem from actors overseas using malicious cyber activities to inflict harm on @entity12 without ever leaving their desks			2
' ms @entity161 warned ' no one connected to the internet is immune ' to the threat , buyt added the sanctions are ' not a tool that we will use every day ' and ' law - abiding companies have absolutely nothing to worry about ' .			0
