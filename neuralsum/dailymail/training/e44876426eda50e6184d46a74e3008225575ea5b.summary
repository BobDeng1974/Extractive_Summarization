however the coroner at the inquest criticised the school nursing system after hearing that @entity109 had responsibility at the time for the welfare of around 5,000 pupils across five secondary schools and at least 20 primary schools			2
the @entity46 have also come under heavy criticism for failing to offer @entity17 an appointment with a social worker until her mother , @entity118 , called them - despite the case being classed as ' urgent '			0
