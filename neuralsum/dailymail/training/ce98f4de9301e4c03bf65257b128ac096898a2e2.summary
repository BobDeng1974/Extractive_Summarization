@entity0 believes people are desperate for him to fail in his quest for a @entity4 spot			2
the @entity8 star 's @entity6 place is under severe threat from first - choice starter @entity10 and @entity12 wonderkid @entity11			1
@entity0 has enjoyed a return to the @entity8 line - up in crunch games against @entity16 and @entity17 after spending much of the season displaced at left back by the right - footed @entity19			1
in action : @entity0 , evading @entity17 's @entity21 on sunday , has to fight for his @entity4 spot ahead in the race : @entity10 is the favourite for a starting berth in @entity6 's left - back spot and with a fight on his hands for his place for club and country , @entity0 , 33 , says he not only has to contend with @entity10 and @entity11 but the weight of public opinion			1
' there was probably a lot of pressure on me to fight for my @entity6 spot , ' @entity0 told @entity39			2
' maybe not just my starting spot even - just to get on the plane			0
i think everyone wanted me to fail , to be honest			0
' i think real football fans understand what i bring to a team and what i give to a team and if i do make it on the plane hopefully people can see that			1
' but ultimately most people wanted me to fail in @entity16 last week , for sure			0
' maybe people have seen me play for 13 years for my country and have probably had enough of it			2
' you look at the players and you have @entity10 who is playing brilliantly and young @entity11 who has done amazing this season so i do n’t blame them , they ’ve got reasons to , but like i said in my @entity60 ad - i ’m not done yet			0
' young gun : @entity12 's @entity11 , holding off @entity62 , could challenge for a squad place three @entity64 : @entity65 has won an incredible 107 @entity6 caps			0
