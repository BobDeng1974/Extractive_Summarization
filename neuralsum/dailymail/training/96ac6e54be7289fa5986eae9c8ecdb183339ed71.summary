by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 15:18 est , 16 october 2013 probe : a former inspector accused of ' acting on behalf ' of @entity2 by contacting @entity4 police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated a former inspector accused of ' acting on behalf ' of @entity2 by contacting @entity4 police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated , it was revealed today			1
the man , who worked for @entity11 , will be probed by the @entity12 over claims he helped the sex offender in 2009			1
@entity2 had been accused of abusing girls at @entity16 in the late 1970s - but was let off just before his death			1
the @entity12 was brought in after it emerged the detective , known only as inspector 5 , may have interfered on @entity2 's behalf			2
it came on the day after @entity22 released transcripts of a 56 - minute interview with them in 2009 , two years before he died , where he fobbed them off with lies , bluster and legal threats			1
@entity2 ran rings around detectives probing child sex claims against him			1
the 83 - year - old said accusations from three of his teenage victims were the ‘ complete fantasy ’ of people ‘ looking for a few quid ’			2
@entity2 even boasted he ‘ owned ’ the @entity42 hospital at @entity43 and said he brushed off girls ‘ like midges ’			1
he also admitted entertaining officers from @entity11 at his home in @entity48 , and that they were aware of previous ‘ blackmail attempts ’ from ‘ weirdos ’ but because he was ‘ easy - going ’ they had not investigated them			0
repeatedly reminding the @entity4 detectives of his charity work , he feigned incredulity at each allegation they put to him			0
the transcripts show the officers treated @entity2 with kid gloves and pose the question whether a more determined approach could have led to his prosecution			1
@entity22 released this transcript of an interview with @entity2 in october , 2009 , following sexual assault allegations at @entity65 and a children 's home accusations : @entity2 visited @entity69 in the 1970s , pictured here in 1974 , where he allegedly attacked several young women			1
it is not suggested that any of the women are in this picture in march the policing watchdog @entity76 identified 11 failures in the case , including the ‘ lack of challenge to @entity2 ’s assertions ’			0
the transcripts were released by @entity22 following a freedom of information request			1
a major review of the decision not to charge @entity2 in 2009 concluded in january there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories , or that they were unreliable			1
yet police and prosecutors treated the claims to @entity22 – and one made by a fourth victim to @entity96 – ‘ with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required ’			1
the report by senior @entity101 lawyer @entity100 , @entity102 , was released in tandem with an official police probe into the @entity105 ’s 60 years of abuse			1
it was revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 , including children as young as eight			0
the @entity76 said it was wrong to allow @entity2 to choose where and when his ‘ ineffective ’ interview took place			2
he claimed to ' own ' the hospital ' i run this hospital ' : @entity2 , speaking to a patient at @entity65 in 1990 , was interviewed under caution by police two years before his death ( file picture ) @entity2 was interviewed under caution on october 1 , 2009 , in his office at @entity65 , where police now believe he abused scores of patients he was supposedly helping through his volunteer work			1
at the beginning of the interview , the officers politely asked @entity2 whether it was ‘ ok ’ to call him @entity2 and thanked him for ‘ kindly ’ letting them use his office to conduct the interview			1
they had received an allegation in may 2007 that @entity2 had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at @entity16 in @entity138 in the late 1970s			2
in the investigation that followed , two more allegations emerged – the first that in about 1973 @entity2 had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside @entity65			2
the second was that in the 1970s @entity2 had suggested to a girl aged about 17 , again at @entity145 , that she perform a sex act on him			1
asked to comment on claims he abused a girl in the tv room at @entity150 , he replied ‘ it never happened and it is a fabrication ’			0
told that he was accused of putting a girl ’s hand on his groin area , he snapped : ‘ it ’s starting to sound like the @entity157 ’s tea party this ’			2
@entity2 , now regarded as @entity160 ’s most prolific child sex predator , furiously denied suggestions he was attracted to underage girls			2
publication of the interviews will reignite speculation that some who worked at @entity43 deliberately overlooked @entity2 ’s sexual abuse of patients because of the money he raised for the hospital			1
word for word : this section of the police interview shows how @entity2 believed victims should be ' brushed away like midges ' and added that he ' owned ' @entity43 , where he is known to have abused victims explanation : police asked @entity2 about his ' policy ' , which was to make any allegations about his abuse ' disappear ' a during the interview , @entity2 says : ‘ i own this hospital , @entity42 run it , i own it , and that ’s not bad			1
and one of the reasons that i get , that i take it seriously is that i would n’t let anything get out of hand to run the risk of spoiling things for my people here			0
@entity2 claimed women flocked to him because of his work on @entity195 and @entity196 ‘ because if i was n’t here , they would n’t get the quarter of a million pound a year they need to keep it going			0
’ last year staff at the hospital were accused of a cover - up			0
@entity2 also bragged about his charity work at @entity205 , scene of more of his abuse : ‘ i mean for 50 years i ’ve had a set of keys at @entity205 , but i never forget the rules , never forget the rules			2
you can if you want , but you finish up dead			0
’ last night @entity213 , a former head of @entity215 ’s paedophile squad , said the @entity22 interview appeared to have been ‘ too informal and ‘ lacked rigour ’			2
the ex @entity219 detective chief inspector said of the interviewing officers : ‘ their tone was sympathetic and not challenging enough			0
i would surmise they were very good when dealing with victims but not the best interviewers when questioning a suspect , particularly such a manipulative one			0
‘ he was never challenged by any of the questioning and none of his answers probed			0
‘ the interview was subtly led by him to some extent			0
he denied any allegation in short sentences but when allowed to give an opinion waxed lyrically and at length over what a good person he was			0
‘ it is a classic case of minimising any wrong doing			0
i bet he was polite and probably charming , all part of his manipulation			0
@entity242 , the police and crime commissioner for @entity4 , said that the force he monitors ‘ could have done better ’ when probing ‘ nasty piece of work ’ @entity247			0
he said : ‘ @entity22 are right to release these interview transcripts under freedom of information laws			1
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
