@entity0 may have been full of praise for @entity2 after the @entity4 side knocked @entity5 out of the @entity6 on saturday , but that did n't stop him from mistakenly referring to them as ' @entity9 '			1
@entity2 shocked @entity0 's side by coming back from a 2 - 0 deficit to earn an historic 4 - 2 victory at @entity12 , and although the defeat will stick in the @entity16 manager 's memory , it would seem he 'd forgotten their name shortly after the final whistle			1
when asked if he had underestimated the @entity4 side with his team selection , @entity0 needed the help of @entity5 's director of communications @entity23 to correctly pronounce @entity2			1
@entity0 accidentally referred to @entity2 as @entity9 during his post-match press conference the @entity2 squad celebrate their famous @entity6 fourth round win at @entity12 on saturday the 51 - year - old said : ' today the priority was the @entity6 and the fact that we did n't play with our best team or our best players is not a way to say we did n't carry the competition			1
we did carry the competition			0
' is there any player in @entity9 ... how do you say ? no , their team ? @entity2			2
@entity2 manager @entity42 ( right ) and his players and staff celebrate their third goal ' is there any @entity2 player that can play for @entity5 with all due respect ? no. ' the selection was good			0
the players should obviously have won this game			0
perhaps @entity0 can be forgiven for still being in shock following the result which saw a strike before half - time from @entity56 followed by goals from @entity58 and @entity59 put the @entity60 ahead before @entity61 confirmed their progress in injury time			2
@entity0 is n't the first foreign import to get things a bit muddled when referring to opposing teams ... earlier this season , @entity69 boss @entity68 seemed to be a bit hungry when discussing his side 's @entity73 clash against @entity75			2
he said : ' they ( @entity75 ) played in the same play style as @entity78			0
' @entity80 winger @entity79 also got lost in translation when attempting to discuss @entity84 's @entity83 victory against @entity85			0
he said : i was on the bench for the game against @entity89			0
' former @entity5 player @entity58 celerates after scoring his team 's equaliser against @entity5 @entity0 insists his side do care about the @entity6 after an astonishing 4 - 2 defeat to @entity2 on saturday			1

@entity0 refers to @entity2 as ' @entity9 ' after @entity60 defeat his side 4 - 2 in @entity6 fourth round
@entity99 boss has to ask media *officer* to to pronounce @entity2
@entity2 came from two goals behind to win historic *cup* tie
