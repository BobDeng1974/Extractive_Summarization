by @entity1 reporter published : 18:15 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 18:39 est , 18 march 2014 four veterans who served for years in the @entity5 military have been grounded after their names were among those of 13 @entity5 believed to have been added to the government 's no - fly list			1
the group , who have found themselves barred from flying to the @entity5 , are suing the government over claims that the list denies them the right to due process			1
for many , including @entity17 , who converted to @entity18 after serving in the @entity19 , the first sign they have of being on the list is when they are stopped from boarding flights back to their homes in the @entity5 denied : @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , right , are included in a lawsuit suing over the no - fly list @entity17 served in the @entity19 from 1999 to 2003 and , after his honorable discharge , began work for a private company in @entity33			1
he later converted to @entity18 and joined an anti-war group but , according to his father , @entity34 is a loyal @entity5			0
he first discovered he was on the no - fly list in 2010 , when he tried to board a flight to @entity39 after getting married			1
the bar meant that in order to return home to the @entity5 he had to travel by bus from @entity44 , through @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 before reaching the @entity5 his father told @entity50 : ' it ’s affected him immensely			2
he ca n’t travel unless it ’s by car or by foot			0
and he has the @entity54 following his every move , 24/7			0
' @entity34 , like the others on the list , has no way of finding out why he has been barred from flights			1
when he was barred from boarding the plane in @entity39 he was told to visit the nearest embassy , where his passport was taken from him but no answers were given			1
the government has refused to confirm or deny if those bringing the case are on the no - fly list			1
solution : district judge @entity70 says officials need to find a way to let those on the list know why they have been blocked in 2010 , mr @entity17 , who now lives in @entity74 , wrote in a blogpost that he cooperated with officials , handing over his cell phone sim card and a list of contacts in the @entity81			2
he claims that he has been ' interrogated day in and day out by the @entity54 ' despite not being given a reason for why his name is on the list			1
the @entity84 , which is representing them , said the process used by the @entity54 's terrorist screening center , is unconstitutional because those on the list have no way of knowing what caused them to be added , and therefore are not able to contest it			1
according to @entity93 , in 2012 the federal no - fly list included about 21,000 people , including 500 @entity5			1
the 13 @entity5 bringing the lawsuit over their inclusion on the list have been barred from domestic flights and those flying to and from the @entity5 their names were added between 2009 and 2012			1
one of the other veterans suing under the lawsuit is @entity27 , who was trying to fly from @entity74 to @entity102 when he first realized he was on the no - fly list			1
the former @entity104 said the ban has caused him to miss key family events , including weddings and funerals , and said it has led to a loss for his dog - training business			0
according to the @entity112 , he was added to the list after sending emails to a @entity116 cleric the @entity54 was watching , and then refusing to hand over information about fellow @entity116			0
@entity27 and @entity119 's cases illustrate the personal restrictions being on the no - fly list cause			2
a federal judge has rejected claims by the @entity124 that the list does not lead to a bar on travel by other means			2
in august @entity5 district judge @entity70 rejected claims that the no - fly list does not deprive citizens of their civil liberties			1
she demanded a solution for those on the list to find out why they were added and to be able to maintain their right to due process			1
government lawyers this week however said national security issues limited a person 's rights to a hearing about their no - fly status			0
they warned @entity70 against taking over policy making if she rules the current system is unfair			0
in august the circuit court of appeals gave @entity70 responsibility for the lawsuit , which was launched in 2010			0
the @entity152 judge has not said when she expects to make a decision in the case			0
attorney for the @entity84 , @entity156 , has said the current system denies @entity5 the right to contest the evidence that led to them being on the no - fly list			2
' when the government deprives people of those rights , it must provide them notice and a meaningful opportunity to clear their names , ' @entity160 told @entity50			0
currently , those barred from boarding a flight to the @entity5 can try to contest it with the @entity171			0
if they are then unhappy with the department 's ruling they can apply for a judicial review bit not a hearing , where evidence against them would be presented			0
for @entity17 and the others fighting their inclusion on the no - fly list , the travel limbo has left them in despair			2
' i am a veteran of the @entity5 armed forces and i have no criminal record			0
i am no threat to national security and have been charged with no crime , ' @entity17 wrote in 2010			0
' the @entity54 put me on a list that turned my life upside - down and there is no process in place to make them tell me why , or let me respond to any accusations they may have against me			2

lawsuit claims those barred from flying are being denied their right to due process
army veteran @entity26 only discovered he was on the list after trying to fly home from @entity39
