by @entity0 published : 00:32 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 5 march 2013 meddling : @entity1 was accused of make political comments after he criticised plans to curb free legal aid a senior judge was yesterday accused of meddling in politics after saying that legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness			1
@entity1 , the head of the country ’s highest court , warned that stripping half a million @entity14 of the right to free lawyers would ‘ lead to people taking the law into their own hands ’			2
he added that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would ‘ start to undermine the rule of law ’			1
the 65 - year - old judge , who is president of the @entity22 , spoke as the @entity24 ’s attempt to reform the legal aid system is about to take effect			1
the shake - up of legal aid in civil cases is aimed at saving taxpayers £ 350million a year in lawyers ’ bills			1
criticising the judge ’s remarks , @entity33 , @entity34 mp for @entity35 , said : ‘ if the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents , justice would be even - handed in the first place			0
‘ but the self - serving legal elite has made justice so expensive that the state has had to subsidise lawyers			2
@entity1 should concentrate on providing cheaper justice and stop bellyaching			2
’ criminologist dr @entity50 , of the @entity52 think - tank , said : ‘ it is inappropriate for the president of the @entity22 to make such political comments			2
the new president of the @entity22 warned confidence in the legal system and ' the whole democratic process ' could be undermined by curbing access to justice ‘ he is also misguided : it is the commercial exploitation of the law that has undermined people ’s respect … lawyers no longer see themselves as servants of justice			1
in some respects he appears to be speaking as a trade unionist for a special interest group			0
’ lord @entity1 told the @entity71 : ‘ my worry is the removal of legal aid for people to get advice about law and get representation in court will start to undermine the rule of law because people will feel like the @entity82 is n’t giving them access to justice in all sorts of cases			1
‘ that will either lead to frustration and lack of confidence in the system , or it will lead to people taking the law into their own hands			0
’ in a separate interview , he told a newspaper : ‘ rich people can always afford legal advice and representation , but unless you have access to legal advice for poorer people you have not got the rule of law			2
‘ you get more and more people who do n’t believe in the government we have , which is very undermining , or who end up taking the law into their own hands or a bit of both , which is not good for us , nor for the country			0
’ lord @entity1 ’s intervention – which is understood to have surprised other senior judges – came less than a month before the cuts go into operation at the start of april			0
the reforms mean legal aid will no longer be available for whole classes of compensation claims , including those made over medical negligence , personal injury and employment law			1
taxpayer support will also be withdrawn from many family law , education , immigration , debt , housing and benefit disputes			0
the judge ’s remarks were a shot across the bows of justice secretary @entity142 , who yesterday announced more legal aid reforms			2
these will try to reduce the price of taxpayer - funded defence lawyers in criminal cases by making law firms submit competitive tenders for criminal legal aid work , so that solicitors and barristers would be forced to compete on price for work			1
@entity34 and @entity156 governments and now the @entity24 have all tried to reform legal aid since the 1980s , during which time taxpayer spending on lawyers ’ bills has more than quadrupled to £ 2.1billion a year			1
official figures show that in the financial year to march 2011 , six barristers each made more than £ 500,000 from criminal legal aid cases			1
another was paid more than £ 450,000 for civil legal aid cases			1
analysis by @entity169 justice secretary @entity142 has so far resisted engaging in a public row with @entity1 @entity1 opted to focus his attack on the most emotive cuts being made by the @entity173 : the ending of legal aid for court battles over benefits and family disputes			1
but , far from being a rare event , the legal aid taps are running constantly in the civil courts			2
figures released under the @entity183 show that £ 645million is spent annually on family law alone			0
increasing breakdowns between parents who are fighting bitter custody battles over their children are costing the taxpayer £ 468million			0
taxpayers are also spending £ 25million on divorce cases			0
but it is not only the children of warring parents who are going to lose out			0
taxpayers are handing nearly £ 500,000 a week in legal aid to prisoners to help them make human rights claims			1
the bill has spiralled from £ 1million a year before the @entity200 came into force in 2000 to more than £ 25million in 2010			0
the money has helped prisoners addicted to heroin to win thousands in compensation for being forced to go ‘ cold turkey ’ when locked up			0
justice secretary @entity142 decided against engaging in a public row with @entity1 yesterday			0
instead , he unveiled plans to target the criminal legal aid bill next			1
there will , inevitably , be more howls of protest			0
but can it really be argued that the system is working efficiently when the former fugitive tycoon @entity215 – who rented a £ 23,000 - a - month @entity217 residence during his trial – received £ 1,056,588 in legal aid after claiming he was bankrupt ? the government is trying to recoup some of the costs			1
lord @entity1 is not alone in opposing the cuts in legal aid			1
the @entity224 , the @entity225 and the @entity226 have argued since 2010 that if the £ 2billion - a - year legal aid budget is slashed the ‘ rule of law will be undermined ’			1
but they are trade unions whose job is to oppose their members ’ pay being cut – even if they are not exactly on the breadline			0
judges , on the other hand , are meant to keep their noses out of politics			0
they take a very dim view when ministers criticise their rulings in human rights cases			0
indeed , @entity1 criticised home secretary @entity243 yesterday for daring to question why judges had ignored the will of @entity246 in relation to deporting foreign criminals			0
if judges expect dignified silence from the government , surely ministers have a right to expect the head of the @entity22 to behave in the same way – no matter how strongly he disagrees with them .			2

@entity1 warns plans to limit legal aid will undermine the rule of law
critics tell president of the @entity22 to ' stop *bellaching* '
ministers want to save £ 350million - a - year in lawyers ' bills
