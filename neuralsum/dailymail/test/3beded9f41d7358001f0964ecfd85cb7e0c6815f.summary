a part - time worker had the shock of her life after she was ordered to pay more three quadrillion pounds in pension contributions			1
the blunder at the pensions office in @entity6 , in the @entity8 area of @entity9 saw a letter sent out the woman asking for £ 3,351,978,728,190,661			1
the bill is more than a thousands times than the whole of @entity9 's annual gross domestic product			2
how much is one quadrillion ? this graphic shows what one quadrillion pennies would look like stacked on top of each other			2
the block would dwarf the @entity22 in @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity26 's @entity25 the £ 3.35 billion is also enough to pay the @entity28 government debt nearly 2,000 times over			1
