a drug addict who mugged frail pensioner @entity1 wept today as he heard lawyers will argue his attack was a ' hate crime '			1
prosecutors say @entity6 deliberately targeted his 4ft 6in , visually - impaired 67 - year - old victim out of hostility towards the disabled			1
the cowardly attack on mr @entity1 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , shocked @entity14 in january and a fundraising campaign to buy him a new home made £ 330,000 in just a few days			1
@entity1 - who suffers growth problems and is partially sighted - was attacked by drug addict @entity6 ( right ) in january			1
prosecutors today called for the offence to be categorised as a disability hate crime @entity6 , 25 , also of @entity12 , appeared briefly at @entity21 via a videolink from @entity23 today , where he is being kept in segregation for his own safety			1
he will be sentenced on april 2			0
the mugger sat hunched in his chair today as he followed proceedings and broke down in tears at one point			0
@entity31 , prosecuting , said @entity6 struck in an area of sheltered accommodation for disabled and elderly people			2
he also made a partial admission to police that he knew of mr @entity1 prior to the attack			0
the court heard that , in mr @entity1 's opinion , he was attacked due to his disability			2
mr @entity31 said if it was agreed that @entity6 specifically targeted mr @entity1 ' it can be inferred there is a general hostility towards people of disability '			0
that could mean @entity6 was guilty of a disability hate crime , which would aggravate the assault with intent to rob charge that he admitted last month			1
mr @entity31 added : ' it is pure inference that is sought by the crown			0
' the attack on mr @entity1 sparked outrage around @entity14 and led to his neighbour , beautician @entity58 , organising a fund to help the 67 - year - old donations flooded in from around the world and saw mr @entity1 given £ 330,000 to buy him a new home but judge @entity64 suggested the claim of a general hostility towards disabled people was ' hollow ' and told the court the aggravating circumstances would be factored into the sentencing anyway			1
he said the prosecution must serve evidence to back up their claims within a week			0
judge @entity74 told @entity6 at the end of the 10 - minute hearing he would continue to be remanded in custody and ' an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable '			0
it has previously been said in court that @entity6 was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he mugged mr @entity1			0
his victim was shoved over and broke his collar bone but @entity6 fled empty - handed when mr @entity1 called for help .			2
