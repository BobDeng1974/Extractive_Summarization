@entity0 will step up his search for holding midfielders in the wake of the defensive debacle against @entity5 — but the club fear that they will be unable to prise @entity7 from @entity8			1
@entity9 identified @entity7 , @entity11 ’s @entity10 and @entity12 , also at @entity8 , as transfer targets			1
@entity14 international @entity7 is top of their list — but the 24 - year - old extended his deal at @entity8 until june 2019 in december			1
@entity9 are looking to try and sign @entity8 midfielder @entity7 @entity7 is on loan at @entity22 and has never actually played of @entity8 curiously , @entity7 has never played for @entity8 , having been on loan at @entity23 and @entity22 , where he played so well he was selected for @entity14 ’s @entity25 - winning squad , starting in the final			1
but having been ignored by @entity8 until now , it will be politically embarrassing for him to leave the club in a £ 20million deal without ever playing for the first team			2
when he signed his new deal , @entity8 announced that he would return to them next season and be a key player			0
inquiries will be made as to whether the club would sell , though the new contract makes any negotiation difficult			0
the 24 - year - old could cost up to £ 20 million , and recently signed a new contract with the club until 2019 @entity7 's form while on loan last season earned him a place in @entity14 's @entity25 winning squad the holding midfielder started the @entity25 final , but was taken off early on because of an injury @entity7 ’s return to @entity8 may , however , open the way for @entity9 to sign @entity12			1
if @entity7 returns and is not for sale , @entity9 will hope that the @entity51 club will be willing to let @entity12 go and he could provide an alternative — and @entity9 might be able to sign him for around £ 15m			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , would hold out for £ 25m for @entity10			2
@entity9 ’s lack of world - class players in that position means that recruitment is a necessity this summer			0
@entity59 is expected to sign a new four - year deal in the coming weeks but there is a recognition at the club that it will become increasingly hard for club captain @entity64 to maintain his position in the starting xi when he returns from injury			0
if @entity7 proves to be unavailable @entity9 could look at his leverkusen club - mate @entity12 ( centre ) @entity11 star @entity10 ( right ) is another option that @entity0 is considering likewise , @entity71 , who has one year left on his deal , is regarded as a squad player rather than a first - team starter			1
meanwhile @entity0 has reacted to @entity76 ’s latest barb by implying that @entity9 , who take on @entity78 today , are not wholly out of the title race			2
@entity76 went on tv last week to say that @entity0 had a ‘ dream job ’ but that he did n’t understand why the team was n’t challenging @entity83 and @entity84 at the top of the @entity87 table			0
@entity0 said : ‘ leave @entity76 out of here , it would be much better			0
let ’s wait until the end of the season , we have 48 points today			0
we will see at the end of the season			0

@entity9 hoping to sign @entity8 holding player @entity7
new contract may lead @entity101 to sign @entity7 's team - mate @entity12
@entity11 star @entity10 also on @entity0 's *wishlist*
