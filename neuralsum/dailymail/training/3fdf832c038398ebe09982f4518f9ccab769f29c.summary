a botched restoration of a painting that was labelled ' @entity2 has incredibly attracted a huge upsurge in tourism to a tiny @entity6 village			1
in the town of @entity11 , northern @entity6 , pensioner @entity8 took it upon herself , she says with the permission of the priest , to touch up the ' @entity16 ' ( behold @entity18 ) painting that was stationed in the @entity20 church			1
the original was drawn by @entity22 , a @entity23 art professor , but neglect in preserving the portrait stung mrs @entity26 into action			2
the painting is a 120 - year - old fresco			1
but since the makeover , the restoration has attracted 150,000 tourists from all over the world , with people paying 80p ( 1 euro ) to view the ' masterpiece '			0
speaking after news of her work broke , mrs @entity26 told @entity6 tv : ' we have always repaired everything ourselves here			2
the priest knew about it			0
' how could i do something like that without permission ? i did not do it in secret			0
anybody who entered the church was able to see me painting			0
' i had nothing but good intentions and always believed i was doing the right thing			0
besides , i had n't finished the painting ! ' mrs @entity26 ( left ) has become some sort of celebrity in the @entity6 town of @entity11 after she completely transformed the @entity16 ' ( behold @entity18 ) painting ( pictured right ) her handiwork has seen @entity26 commissioned to design logos for the local winery , and the image of the new ' face of @entity2 ' adorns the town of 5,000 's lottery tickets			1
however not everyone is happy with the developments			0
the grandchildren of the original artist sent a letter through a lawyer requesting the painting be destroyed as it brought shame on the original work and ' damages the honour of the family			1
' however , a professional study decided it was impossible to restore the piece - in essence , mrs @entity26 's painting has become a ' new piece ' .			2

@entity8 touched up 120 - year - old ' @entity16 ' ( behold the man )
*initially* ridiculed , painting in @entity11 , @entity6 attracts thousands of tourists
but grandchildren of original artist says work ' damages honour of family '
