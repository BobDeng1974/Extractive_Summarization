a super-fast ' @entity1 ' mobile network could be available in the @entity2 this year - but the new @entity3 might not work with the @entity2 network			1
phone company @entity5 has submitted an application to @entity7 to use its existing @entity9 ' slice ' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4g services in the @entity2			1
but it 's a slightly different frequency to the @entity14 networks the new @entity3 is built to work on - and it 's not clear whether @entity15 will update its tablet to work with the @entity2 's network			1
@entity5 , ceo at @entity5 , said earlier this year , @entity20 s vision is to launch @entity1 for @entity2 as soon as possible			2
' bigger , faster : the third version of the @entity3 , pictured above is the first to offer a 4g connection - but users in the @entity2 and other territories could miss out , as our networks may not work with new machine the new network would deliver broadband - style speeds across the air - allowing for mobile devices to deliver services uch as @entity33 videos which begin playing instantly			1

@entity5 is to run trials of the technology in @entity58 and @entity59 - and says it is spending £ 1.4 million a year on researching @entity1			0
the company says that the new @entity3 may not work with either the @entity62 network to launch before the end of 2012 - or @entity2 's upcoming ' real ' 4g network			1
‘ @entity15 ’s published facts on the new @entity3 suggest that the its 4g capabilities are fixed to @entity67 and @entity69 spectrum frequencies , which are the ones used in the @entity14 and @entity71 for 4g connectivity			2
