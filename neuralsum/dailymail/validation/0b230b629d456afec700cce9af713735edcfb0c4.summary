at least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by an horrific kidney disease , vets have warned			1
in the first recorded outbreak of @entity6 rot to be reported in @entity7 , dogs have fallen ill and died up and down the country			1
pet owners are warned to look out for lesions on their dogs ' legs as vets continue to search for the cause of the disease			1
the disease was unknown in this country until november 2012 , when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the @entity18 , @entity19 outbreaks of @entity6 rot , which attacks blood vessels in the skin and kidneys , have affected dogs in the @entity25 as long ago as the 1980s			1
but the disease was unknown in this country until november 2012 , when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the @entity18 , @entity19			1
the results of an investigation into the outbreak , published last night in the journal @entity33 , reveal the full horror of the disease			0
although the initial cases were reported in @entity19 , incidents have since been confirmed across @entity38 and @entity39 , from @entity40 in the @entity41 to @entity42 in the @entity43			0
unlike the @entity25 cases , which have only affected greyhounds , the @entity7 outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds			1
it has affected @entity38 springer spaniels , flat coated retrievers , whippets , labradors - dogs of all shapes and sizes from a cocker spaniel to a doberman			1
there have been 103 suspected incidents reported by vets , lead researcher @entity62 told the @entity63 last night , although only 52 of those have been confirmed by postmortem examinations			2
all those dogs died - either killed by the disease or put down by their vets			1
unlike the @entity25 cases , which have only affected greyhounds , the @entity7 outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds , including this retriever @entity72 who died from the disease mr @entity62 , a vet who practises in @entity19 , said the team 's investigation had not established why the disease had so suddenly sprung up , how it had arrived in @entity7 , or why certain dogs had been affected			1
but he warned pet owners to remain alert to symptoms			0
' the main message is that we are still seeing cases spring up			0
although the numbers are relatively small , continued vigilance is the best thing			0
people should look out for skin lesions when the dog has n't obviously been cut on something			2
' he admitted much remains unknown about the problem			2
' we do n't know whether this is a condition that has been in the @entity7 for a while , but just was unrecognised , or whether it had recently emerged , ' he said			1
one of the many dogs struck down the disease was @entity101 , a three - year - old fox terrier cross , who died in february 2014 after walking near @entity103 in the @entity18			1
the scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus , or whether the problem was genetic - this spaniel , @entity111 , died of the disease her owner @entity113 , of @entity114 , @entity19 , took her to the vet but her condition worsened and @entity101 died soon afterwards			2
she said at the time : ' my poor little girl had been through so much			0
' tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas			0
i had to make the decision to put her down , which is heartbreaking			0
' the investigation found no obvious link between any of the dogs - even those who became ill within a few days in the @entity18			2
mr @entity62 said : ' when we looked at all their walking routes and other factors , we could find nothing in common			0
' the results rule out early theories that the dogs had been poisoned by contaminated food			2
they also ruled out a link to the @entity141 shiga toxin , another early theory			0
the scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus , or whether the problem was genetic			0
they are comparing it to a similar human disease of the kidneys , called @entity152 , which is genetic but can be caused by exposure to certain medications , to see whether it can offer any clues .			0

at least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by @entity6 rot
@entity161 , unknown in @entity7 till 2012 , attacks blood vessels in skin and kidneys
