by @entity0 published : 13:35 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 8 february 2013 the bigger a ceo 's signature the more likely he or she is to be a narcissist , a new study claims			1
the research which compared the signatures of some 605 ceos of @entity11 firms found that size does matter where boss 's autographs are concerned			1
it found that bosses with bigger signatures also tended to get the highest pay , but were in fact more likely to run their companies into the ground			1
bosses : a study comparing the signatures of hundreds of @entity9 of @entity11 firms found that - when it comes to autographs - size does matter bold : magnate @entity28 's signature is seen scrawled at the bottom of this letter the study by academics at the @entity33 at the @entity34 took the signatures of ceos from company accounts filings with the @entity37			1
the authors identify narcissism as an egotistical character trait ' associated with conceit and disregard for others '			0
' similarly , narcissism creates biased self - perception in the form of upwardly biased evaluation of one â€™s own abilities and performance , ' they say in the paper			0
these qualities make them bad decision makers , the study says , but enables them to convince directors and shareholders of their competency to the extent that they get better pay			1
flourish : president @entity61 is seen signing his nomination for @entity64 chief of staff @entity63 to be named treasury secretary top boss : president @entity61 left his sizeable signature alongside wife @entity69 's during their visit to @entity72 in @entity73 professor @entity74 , one of three authors of the study , told @entity77 that the 605 signatures analysed were found largely on annual reports and other documents filed by @entity82 companies as of july 2011			1
the s&p 500 index tracks the most valuable 500 companies listed on @entity11 stock markets			1
signatures were fed into a custom coded computer program which drew a rectangle around each of them and measured the area they covered			1
' we standardized the measure by dividing the area by the number letters in the ceo 's signature , ' professor @entity74 said			0
professor @entity74 said he and his co-authors relied on findings from previous psychological studies which claimed that bigger signatures mean bigger egos			2
' @entity104 ' : @entity105 ' @entity63 's signature , which will appear on the dollar bill if he is confirmed as the new @entity11 treasury secretary using the size of the signature as a proxy for the writers ' narcissism , they found that ' narcissistic ceos invest more in capital expenditures and acquisitions but pay lower dividends , with overinvestments being largest in magnitude when financial slack is high			1
aggressive managers who bully their staff are more likely to enjoy career success than even their more competent rivals because people are impressed by their dominance , a study claims			2
researchers found that people who were dominant had a greater influence on others , and could be easily and quickly picked out of a crowd			2
in a two part study , 200 participants completed a problem - solving task in small groups while being videotaped , with volunteers rating each other 's dominance , prestige and influence during the task , as well as their own			2
the researchers defined prestige as the appearance of skill and competency , and dominance as having the ability to impose ideas on others through bullying and intimidation			0
results showed those who were more dominant or prestigious had a greater influence on the task and were seen as more influential by the participants			0
in the second part , 60 extra participants watched a total of 120 seconds of short videos of the initial group interactions while wearing an eye - tracking device			0
the @entity167 team found these participants paid significantly greater attention to individuals who appeared more dominant or prestigious , indicating their higher levels of influence			2
the study also revealed while participants preferred leaders with prestige , they were more likely to choose dominant leaders , and were more forgiving of their behaviour			2
' in addition , narcissistic @entity9 exhibit worse performance as measured by the contemporaneous return on assets , with the effects being largest when operating environments are most uncertain			0
' despite the negative relationship between narcissism and firm performance , these @entity9 receive both higher cash and stock compensation , as well as higher compensation relative to the next highest paid executive at their firm			2
' however , other experts where sceptical of the paper 's conclusions because of its assumption that a larger signature correlates to a bigger ego			0
@entity201 and @entity202 of @entity203 told @entity77 that other factors can determine signature size , including high self - esteem and an extroverted personality			0
they also said that if high self - esteem was what lay behind a company boss 's oversized autograph , it 's possible that the firm could even benefit from such positive self assurance			0
professor @entity74 conceded this could be the case , but countered that he and his colleagues do not claim to have found a one - to - one correspondence between large signatures and badly run companies , merely that the relationship holds true on average			1
to illustrate the point the researchers compared the relative performance of two companies competing in the same industry to the size of their @entity9 ' signatures			1
@entity232 boss @entity231 has a smaller scribble that @entity235 boss @entity234 , and @entity235 underperformed @entity232 by getting a lower return on its investments			0
professor @entity74 told @entity77 that the ceo they studied with the biggest signature was @entity241 , former boss @entity242 as ceo between 1995 and 2001 , and chairman between 1999 and 2003			0
even allowing for the fact that mr @entity241 led @entity242 during the rise and fall of the internet bubble , the professor said he very much fitted their model			0
female leader : @entity254 chancellor @entity253 's curly script swirling script : the signatures of bosses like @entity258 are said to give clues as to their character traits study : is @entity264 boss sir @entity266 's sizeable signature an indication of his staggering pay packet ? from 1997 to 2001 , @entity242 paid no dividends , made ' extremely high investments ' and gave @entity271 some of the highest pay of any @entity274 boss			1
the signatures of high - profile figures came under the spotlight in the @entity11 last month when @entity61 formally nominated @entity64 chief of staff @entity278 for the post of treasury secretary			1
if mr @entity63 is confirmed as treasury secretary his ' childish ' signature - which has been compared to a curly @entity284 fry - will grace the dollar bill			0
the president joked that he had considered abandoning the nomination after learning of mr @entity63 's bizarre and illegible signature			0
sign on the dotted line : size does matter - at least when it comes to signatures - a new study suggests video : @entity61 jokes about @entity63 's signature in a speech at the @entity64			1
