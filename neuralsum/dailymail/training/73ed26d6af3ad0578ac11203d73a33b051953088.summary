the former head of the @entity13 has been approved by the prime minister to succeed @entity15			0
if confirmed in the post , she will be paid £ 110,000 a year for a three - day working week			1
but @entity18 mp @entity17 , a member of the @entity19 , said she faced questions over her role as a non-executive director on the board of banking giant @entity24			1
the banking group was fined £ 1.2billion in 2012 for breaching @entity27 money - laundering laws and was described as the ‘ bank of choice ’ for @entity31 drug gangs			1
mr @entity17 said : ‘ i want to know what she knew about that scandal and what she did to try to prevent it and what she did to investigate it			2
‘ second , there is a question mark over her lack of experience in broadcasting and the regulation of broadcasting , which are obviously key elements of being the @entity4 chairman			1
’ another member of the committee , @entity51 , has suggested ministers were ‘ determined ’ to appoint a woman to the role			1
mr @entity17 added : ‘ we need to ask if she only got the job because she is a woman			0
i am not saying that @entity58 is the wrong candidate , but our job as a committee is to ask searching questions of any candidate who is put forward for this job			1
’ the 53 - year - old mother of three could also face questions over her political links , having been appointed as a @entity70 business ambassador by @entity71 earlier this year			1
she was a non-executive member of the @entity73 board but stood down when she was selected as the preferred candidate to chair the @entity4			1
cabinet secretary sir @entity76 was on the preliminary interview panel for candidates for the @entity4 role			1
her husband @entity80 , a director of the private equity firm @entity81 , is a former @entity18 councillor in the @entity83 borough of @entity84 and @entity85			2
the government has stressed that she was selected following ‘ an open recruitment process ’ overseen by an independent public appointments assessor			0
@entity18 mp @entity17 , a member of the culture , media and sport select committee , said she is facing questions over her role as a non-executive director on the board of banking giant @entity24 after questioning mrs @entity0 on tuesday of next week , members of the commons select committee will vote on whether they believe she is a suitable candidate and their decision will be put before mr @entity71 for final approval			1
she was chairman and chief executive of the @entity13 for seven years and received a £ 1.1million pay - off when she left last year			2
as well as her @entity24 role , she is a non-executive director of soft drinks giant @entity105			1
the @entity4 will consider whether any of her external roles could represent a conflict of interest			1
mrs @entity0 holds a first - class degree in law from @entity110 and has an mba from @entity112			2
she was recently tipped as a future chairman of @entity114			0
according to the @entity116 , mrs @entity0 expressed a willingness to consider changes to the @entity4 licence fee when she was interviewed by culture secretary @entity120			1
she said : ‘ the @entity4 is a great @entity70 institution packed with talented people , and i ’m honoured to have the opportunity to be chairman of the @entity4			2
’ @entity15 announced in may that he would be standing down as chairman of the @entity4 following heart surgery			2
the previous frontrunner to succeed him , @entity125 , pulled out of the race because he said he could not balance the job with his other commitments			0
mother they called @entity131 who fought all the way to the top by @entity134 @entity58 was made chairman and chief executive of @entity13 in 2006 when you shatter glass ceilings , it helps to have thick skin			2
that ’s something @entity58 has had to learn the hard way on her journey to the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the @entity4 in its 91 - year history			1
at the @entity13 , where she was made chairman and chief executive in 2006 , boorish male journalists nicknamed her ‘ @entity131 ’ , in the belief that she owed the job to gender - based tokenism rather than talent			2
now , male mps are making similar noises , with @entity51 , a @entity18 who sits on the @entity162 committee that will vote on her appointment , expressing ‘ enormous ’ regret ‘ that the government seems determined to appoint a woman simply because it ’s a woman , rather than go out and find the best person ’			0
others , including conservative @entity17 , have voiced concerns about her involvement in recent pay - off and money - laundering controversies and lack of experience in broadcasting			1
there are also dark rumours of political cronyism			0
mrs @entity0 , who was educated at @entity182 and still speaks with a hint of her native @entity184 , is married to wealthy merchant banker @entity185 , who is a former councillor and senior figure in @entity84 and @entity85 @entity18 circles			0
the couple , who have two teenage sons , and a teenage daughter , live in a £ 4million home in @entity192 , @entity83			0
they are friendly with @entity194 and his wife , @entity195			0
mrs @entity0 ’s links to the @entity198 establishment extend to her agreeing to become one of the @entity201 ’s ‘ business ambassadors ’			0
she also sat on the board of the @entity73 alongside sir @entity76 , @entity70 ’s top civil servant , who is regarded as the most powerful backstage fixer in @entity204			0
strangely , given the need for the @entity4 appointment process to be seen as unimpeachable , sir @entity76 happens to have been the most senior member of the selection board which interviewed her for the new job			2
quite what the members of the @entity212 will make of this incestuousness when they interview her next week is anyone ’s guess			0
yet if history is any guide , mrs @entity0 , will take criticism on the chin			0
she has , after all spent the last 30 years on a sharp - elbowed climb through the boardrooms of corporate @entity70			0
a tenacious professional , who cut her teeth as a management consultant , she has spent the past two years battling breast cancer , while holding down directorships of @entity105 and @entity24 , along with the @entity73 role			1
former @entity231 mandarin @entity229 yesterday described her as ‘ a class act … tough , ethical and likeable ’			0
she is on the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the @entity4 in its 91 - year history mrs @entity0 joined the @entity13 , as chief financial officer in 2002 , and began to achieve public prominence as a protégé of @entity239 , who had in 1997 become the first female @entity241 chief executive as boss of the title ’s parent firm , @entity245			1
mrs @entity0 ’s time at the @entity13 ’s helm , from 2006 onwards , saw the newspaper become hugely - profitable			0
but she decided to leave the company in 2012 , after failing to be appointed to succeed @entity250			0
although the move was voluntary , the firm gave her a pay - off of £ 1.1 million , and allowed her to keep millions more in share options			0
that prompted a shareholder rebellion which saw 37 per cent refuse to endorse @entity245 ’s remuneration report			0
the controversy has eerie parallels with that which engulfed the @entity4 last year , over revelations that senior managers had been given £ 1.4 million in unnecessarily big pay - offs			1
mrs @entity0 , who describes her hobbies in @entity265 ’s as ‘ skiing , scuba diving , flying and family ’ , has never publicly discussed the affair			0
if confirmed in her new post , she must not only restore public confidence in the credibility of a @entity4 severely compromised by the @entity274 affair , but also oversee negotiations for the renewal of the @entity278 ’s charter , which is due to expire in 2016			2
it ’s an unenviable job , but – as woman with a meteoric career and as a member of @entity283 – @entity58 will relish the challenge .			2

@entity58 will appear before a commons select committee next week
will face questions before final decision is reached over her @entity4 role
was non-executive director at bank during money - laundering ' scandal '
@entity24 was described in 2012 as the ' bank of choice ' for @entity31 drug gangs
