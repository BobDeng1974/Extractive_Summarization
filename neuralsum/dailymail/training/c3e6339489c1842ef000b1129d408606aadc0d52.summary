by @entity1 reporter published : 20:08 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 20:14 est , 4 march 2013 first class rail travel has hit a record high in @entity5 but it 's thanks to boozy revellers and youngsters rather than stuffy city gents and business executives , new figures show			1
more than 11 million tickets on the upmarket train compartments were sold last year , believed to be higher than even the golden age of rail travel back in the 1950s			2
yet the modern first class passenger is more likely to be a student , football fan or on a stag or hen party than the upper class image from films like @entity22			1
living the high life : despite the recession , first class travel is proving popular , as in this restaurant car on the train from @entity29 's @entity28 to @entity30 the latest figures are from the @entity32 rounding up all the regional railway operator 's into a nationwide total			2
before the recession the most common kind of upmarket traveller was a high powered commuter or public sector worker who could get the bumper fares paid for on expenses			0
but now it is often more likely to be a gang of revellers off on a hen weekend who have picked up a first class ticket for just £ 5 a journey more than they would have paid for standard fare			1
other typical commuters taking up the best seats on the train include students going home for a weekend having used their railcards to book the cheapest fares well in advance			1
football fans are now more prepared to travel in a bit of style for away games as opposed to the old ' football specials ' where they were herded like cattle into packed carriages			0
there are also other , more bizarre groups of first class travellers			1
according to @entity72 there is a booming market in youngsters travelling from @entity29 to @entity75 on saturday evenings just to go to trendy nightclubs			0
and @entity77 are doing a roaring trade in nostalgic middle aged railway fans travelling first class just to recreate their own golden age of travel on @entity83 with a full silver service meal option			1
fan of first class : chancellor @entity87 was famously caught out by ticket collectors after he refused to move to standard class last year , despite not having a first class ticket it marks a massive turnaround in the kind of passenger now filling the plusher seats in first class , where they get free food and drink and more attentive waiter service			1
a few years ago the prices for first class fares on some city to city routes were so high it was often cheaper to fly instead			2
since then employers have cut back on paying for expensive travel for their workers - even mps have been forced by their expenses scandal to travel on standard class carriages			2
a first class seat from @entity29 to @entity75 , booked in advance , can now be bought for as little as £ 36 one way , for instance			1
2003 - 6,738,921 2004 - 6,922,701 2005 - 7,222,645 2006 - 8,148,420 2007 - 8,851,311 2008 - 9,787,707 2009 - 9,325,282 2010 - 9,722,875 2011 - 10,318,926 2012 - 11,040,364 this led to rail companies bringing down the costs and bringing in special offers , particularly at weekends and evening , for instance offering upgrades to first class for just £ 5 or less			0
and it has sparked a boom in travelling in style but from a whole new market , said @entity32 , which has been compiling first class ticket sales since 2003			0
back then just 6.7 million were bought , rising to 9.8 million in 2008 , dropping the next year but then recovering to the new record high			0
however , the 11 million figure is likely to be the highest ever as recently published statistics show the number of @entity5 train journeys of 1.4 billion in 2012 was actually a 90 - year - high			0
@entity134 , chief executive at @entity32 , said : " train companies have responded to the tough economic climate by offering a range of deals and investing in improved services to encourage more passengers to travel first class			0
" it is exactly this kind of commercial approach by operators that helps to explain why travelling by train has become more popular over a double dip recession , generating revenue to pay for services and sustaining government investment			0

first class travellers are likely to be students or stag and hen parties
@entity83 with a full silver service meal are doing a roaring trade
booked in advance , many first class tickets are now *affordable*
