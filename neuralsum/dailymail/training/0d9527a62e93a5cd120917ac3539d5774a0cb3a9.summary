@entity0 has hit back at claims he is putting his own bank balance before the financial welfare of @entity4			1
the 52 - year - old discussed his resignation as @entity8 boss for the first time on thursday after being branded greedy by some fans for refusing to tear up his contract following a string of poor results			1
with his team languishing nine points behind leaders @entity16 , @entity0 bowed to public pressure last week by telling the board he would serve his 12 - month notice period			1
@entity4 manager @entity0 says he intends to run out his notice after announcing his decision to resign it was business as usual as @entity0 was all smiles as he lead a @entity4 ' training session at @entity27 @entity0 intends to speak with new chief executive @entity28 about the future of the club and the @entity8 icon says he intends to honour the full terms of his contract with his salary controversially set to rise to £ 750,000 for the last year			1
in a rebuke to the board , @entity0 also questioned the public exposure of his salary on two different occasions but insisted the decision to resign as manager was ‘ a relief ’			1
‘ i can understand the opinion of those who say go now , of course i can , and i respect it , ’ he said			0
‘ but i have got a contract to honour and that is what i am going to do because i ai n’t walking out on a contract - it ’s not the right thing to do			2
the bottom line is , until someone tells me otherwise , i ’ve got a contract i want to honour			2
’ @entity0 met director @entity53 for brief talks on his resignation on wednesday			1
unable to pay the lump sum required to terminate his contract early , the @entity8 board hoped the manager might volunteer to sacrifice any pay - off and walk away			2
‘ i went into the meeting on wednesday looking to discuss me handing in my notice , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ but at no time did i think that i would n’t be walking out of it as @entity4 manager			2
i was expecting to walk out of it as @entity4 manager for the next 12 months and that ’s the case			1
’ asked if he expected to see out the full 12 - month notice period set down in his one - year rolling contract , @entity0 added : ‘ yes			1
‘ i do n’t know if it ’s realistic or not but i expect it to happen because it is in the boundaries of the contract			2
@entity4 captain @entity75 in hysterics as he did n't seem to be too affected by his manager 's decision @entity0 ( left ) shares a joke with former player @entity80 during the training session at @entity27 ‘ whose court is the ball in now ? i would n’t say the ball is in anybody ’s court			1
i think it has been made quite clear by the board and myself that it is business as usual			0
’ defending himself against the accusations of greed , @entity0 drew a distinction between himself and the stream of directors who have walked away from the club with large pay - offs , saying : ‘ i worked for nothing for months			1
i decided to take a 45 per cent cut , i then took a 40 per cent cut			0
‘ i ’m not saying : “ a big pat on the back for @entity103 ” but there ’s a wee bit more to it than meets the eye			0
‘ when i signed my contract for @entity4 there was no negotiation			1
‘ @entity111 ( former @entity4 chief executive ) put a contract down and i took a pen and signed it			2
i was just delighted i was getting the job so that ’s what i did			0
‘ during the administration period i worked for nothing so there are other factors that should be taken into account as well			0
i can understand different views and opinions on it but there ’s a wee bit more to it			0
’ the @entity4 statement to the @entity129 confirming @entity0 ’s resignation came on monday morning			1
pointedly , it also revealed that the manager ’s salary would rise for the final year of his contract			1
@entity135 ( centre ) looks to close down the ball during the team 's training session on friday ‘ did it disappoint me that my wages were highlighted ? ’ @entity0 asked			1
‘ when i became the first @entity4 manager in history to have his salary put in the accounts that made me realise that probably nothing should shock me			2
‘ it did n’t disappoint me because it did n’t surprise me			0
was it unnecessary ? that would be the opinion of many , yes			0
if i said it was unnecessary that would give the impression i was upset about it			0
‘ i have nothing to hide , i have nothing to be ashamed of			0
it is what it is			0
‘ people will have their own opinion of it and see it for what it is			0
but it ’s past now			0
put it this way , i was surprised more when my salary was put in the @entity4 accounts			2
’ uncertain if he will now attend what is sure to be a heated club @entity168 on monday , @entity0 said the response from the ‘ vast majority ’ of the @entity4 support to his resignation has been positive			1
‘ the vast , vast majority of them have been very good in the respect that they ’ve thanked me			0
the majority are appreciative of the fact it ’s a very stressful job and it might be time for me , in a year ’s time , to enjoy my life			0
