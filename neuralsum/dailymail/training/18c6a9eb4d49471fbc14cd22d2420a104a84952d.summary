a police force has scrapped an anti-violence online poster after @entity3 users said it showed an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy			1
the image was supposed to promote a campaign to stop drunk and violent people entering pubs and clubs			1
but @entity3 users quickly pointed out that the logo looked more like police brutality - claiming it appeared to show a riot officer beating a prone victim			1
ridiculed : @entity18 and @entity19 were mocked on @entity3 for this online campaign poster - which appeared to depict an officer with a riot stick hitting a victim begging for mercy @entity25 tweeted ' @ @entity26 @ euanmccolm how many drunk people the @entity30 's arrested have had a helmet on and carrying a truncheon ? '			1
police replied that it was ' meant to show one drunk person attacking another , which often happens when drinkers go overboard '			1
but this met with a response from @entity39 , who tweeted ' @ @entity26 a drunk person wearing a riot helmet and carrying a truncheon ? '			2
amazingly , the image can be downloaded from a number of clip - art websites , including pubzi and clker , by searching for the term ' police brutality '			1
a @entity18 and @entity19 spokesman today told @entity51 : ' the breathalyser campaign in @entity53 has been extremely successful in contributing to reducing crime in and around the town centre			1
violent crime was reduced by 45 per cent in january compared to last year			0
' the image used on the infographic posted on social media to celebrate the success of the initiative was intended to depict a violent incident between two drunk members of the public			0
online results : the same image can be found on this clip - art website by searching for ' police brutality ' another clip - art website , called @entity70 , has the same image stored , again with the title ' police brutality ' on this website , openclipart , the controversial image is searchable under a number of terms including ' violence ' , ' brutality ' , ' demonstration ' and ' police ' ' it has since been made clear that the picture could be seen as showing a police officer hitting somebody			1
this was not our intention			0
' we apologise for any offence and it has now been removed			0
we hope that this does not detract from the great campaign we have run with our partners and the licensing trade in @entity53			0
the picture , posted yesterday , was accompanied by the message ' breathalyser scheme @entity95 ... keeping you safe '			0
police want potentially drunk people to be breathalysed before they are allowed into pubs and clubs where they could spark violence			0
the spokesman added ' the breathalyser campaign in @entity53 has been extremely successful in reducing crime in and around the town centre			2
' violent crime was reduced by 45 % in january compared to last year			0
' @entity18 and @entity19 could not provide a copy of the updated info graphic			2
it is said to look exactly the same - but without the controversial image in the top right corner			0
embarrassing : the force ( headquarters pictured ) initially defended the info graphic image but has now changed it by removing the controversial image the ' @entity119 ? ' campaign has been pushed around @entity53 town centre ( pictured )			2

several people claimed that the image appeared to depict police brutality
@entity18 and @entity19 *bizarrely* defended *confusing* campaign image
said it was ' one drunk person attacking another ... which often happens '
but image can be found on clip - art websites under label ' police *britality* '
force has now withdrawn online poster which was part of breathalyser campaign
