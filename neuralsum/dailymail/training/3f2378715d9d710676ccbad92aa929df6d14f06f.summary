bailiffs calling : @entity9 student @entity8 , 21 , spread the teaching of her final academic year over two so she could focus on a tough training schedule for the @entity13 hockey team full - time students are exempt from paying council tax while they study , but as miss @entity8 only attends university for one day a week , she no longer qualifies for this bracket			1
