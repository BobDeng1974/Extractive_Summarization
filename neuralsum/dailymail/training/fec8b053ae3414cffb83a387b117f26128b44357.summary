a new species of shrimp has been discovered living deeper than any seen before in the world 's most extreme deep sea volcanic vents			1
@entity6 scientists made the discovery while on an expedition to explore boiling undersea springs - which may be hotter than @entity10 - on the @entity12 seafloor			1
some 5,000 metres down , in a rift in the seafloor , exists a volcanic spring known as a ' black smoker ' , which fires a jet of mineral - laden water more than a kilometre into the ocean above			2
no little discovery : @entity21 , the world 's deepest known vent shrimp , was found at a depth of 5,000 metres hot stuff : thousands of the newly discovered species of shrimp mass around an oceanic geyser beneath the @entity28 , in temperatres in excess of @entity31 but despite the extreme conditions , the vents are teeming with thousands of a new species of shrimp that has a light - sensing organ on its back			1
the pale shrimp congregate in hordes - up to 2,000 shrimp per square metre - around the six - metre tall mineral spires of the vents			2
lacking normal eyes , the shrimp instead have a light - sensing organ on their backs , which may help them to navigate in the faint glow of deep - sea vents			1
the researchers have named the shrimp @entity52 , after the deep - sea vehicle that they used to collect them			1
water cannon : one of the ' black smoker ' vents , 5,000m down on the @entity12 seafloor , belches a jet of mineral - laden water more than a kilometre into the ocean above the @entity28 shrimp is related to a species called @entity66 , found at other deep - sea vents 4,000 kilometres away on the @entity68			1
the team was led by marine geochemist dr @entity70 , of the @entity71 in @entity72 , and marine biologist dr @entity73 , of the @entity74			0
during an expedition in april 2010 the scientists used a robot submarine to locate and study the vents at a depth of five kilometres in the @entity80 , an undersea trench south of the @entity28			0
the vents are gushing hot fluids that are unusually rich in copper , and shooting a jet of mineral - laden water four times higher into the ocean above than other deep - sea vents			1
although the scientists were not able to measure the temperature of the vents directly , these two features indicate that the world 's deepest known vents may be hotter than @entity31 , according to the researchers			0
elsewhere at the @entity96 , the team saw hundreds of white - tentacled anemones lining cracks where warm water seeps from the sea bed			1
dr @entity73 said : ' studying the creatures at these vents , and comparing them with species at other vents around the world will help us to understand how animals disperse and evolve in the deep ocean			0
' the researchers also found black smoker vents on the upper slopes of an undersea mountain called @entity114 which rises nearly three kilometres above the seafloor of the @entity80 , but its peak is still more than three kilometres beneath the waves			1
dr @entity70 said : ' finding black smoker vents on @entity114 was a complete surprise			0
' @entity122 and acidic vents have never been seen in an area like this before , and usually we do n't even look for vents in places like this			0
' a light in the dark : the vents of @entity114 are also home to snake - like fish and previously unseen species of snail and a flea - like crustacean called an amphipods he said : ' because undersea mountains like @entity114 may be quite common in the oceans , the discovery suggests that deep - sea vents might be more widespread around the world than previously thought			2
' the vents on @entity114 are also thronged with the new species of shrimp , along with snake - like fish , and previously unseen species of snail and a flea - like crustacean called an amphipod			0
dr @entity73 said : ' one of the big mysteries of deep - sea vents is how animals are able to disperse from vent field to vent field , crossing the apparently large distances between them			2
' but maybe there are more " stepping stones " like these out there than we realised			0
' the @entity6 expedition that revealed the vents followed a @entity166 expedition in november 2009 , which detected the plumes of water from deep - sea vents in the @entity80			2
a second @entity166 expedition is currently using a remotely - operated deep - diving vehicle to investigate the vents further and the @entity6 team also plans to return to the @entity80 in 2013 with @entity175 , the @entity71 's deep - diving remotely operated vehicle , which can work at depths of up to 6,000 metres			0
the findings were published in the scientific journal @entity180 .			0
