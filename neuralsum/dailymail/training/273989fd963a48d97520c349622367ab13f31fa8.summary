by @entity0 published : 20:06 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 02:47 est , 11 april 2012 the boss of @entity3 owner @entity3 has scooped a £ 4million bonus – on top of the £ 10million he made last year			1
@entity8 ’s incentive payment comes despite the fact that his firm has plunged millions of its customers into misery with inflation - busting rises in their energy bills			1
@entity3 , which provides power to 13million families in the @entity17 , last year hiked household bills by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity			1
wealthy : @entity8 , chief executive of @entity3 , earned a £ 4m bonus last year despite plunging millions of its customers into misery mr @entity8 ’s performance - related payment also comes despite the fact that @entity3 saw its profits fall by more than £ 1.5billion over the past year – from £ 2.8billion to £ 1.27billion			1
his £ 10million earnings were revealed in @entity3 ’s annual report for 2011 , published a fortnight ago			1
the £ 4million windfall revealed last night comes after two of the group ’s many long - term incentive schemes paid out			1
the staggering amount is enough to pay the average family ’s energy bill for the next 3,000 years			2
mr @entity8 , @entity3 ’s chief executive , received company shares worth £ 3.4million as the delayed instalment of his 2009 bonus			1
and he was gifted another £ 620,000 in shares from a second long - term plan , which also dates back to 2009			2
to receive both amounts , he was required to hit performance targets			0
the same two schemes last year paid out £ 3million to the energy chief			2
last night , the payout was greeted with disgust by critics			0
@entity51 ’s energy spokesman @entity50 said : ‘ it is astonishing that there are even further massive payments to the chief executive of @entity3 at a time when the firm ’s customers are facing the pressure of increased bills and their incomes are being squeezed			1
news of the bonus will be unwelcome among bill payers who are struggling to make ends meet ‘ if this is a performance - related bonus , it begs the question as to what they consider to be effective performance			0
‘ it shows that fundamental reform of the energy market is needed , because at the moment it is not serving the interests of consumers			0
’ @entity78 , of over- @entity79 , warned that fuel poverty was becoming an increasing problem for the elderly			0
he said : ‘ energy prices are continuing to rise leaving elderly people with less cash and a grim choice of whether they should turn the heating on or have a hot meal			0
‘ it is a worry that more people will become fuel poor in the future and we need to try and stop this from happening by offering them assistance and urging energy companies to reduce their bills			0
’ the £ 4million payout comes less than two weeks after @entity3 put out its annual report , detailing eye - watering pay and perks for the @entity3 boss , including a discount of almost £ 700 on his annual energy bill – granted because he sits on the company ’s board			1
even though his basic salary fell from £ 2million in 2010 to £ 1.3million , he benefited from numerous share plans pushing his 2011 earnings to £ 10million			0
his basic pay included £ 63,000 for a car and driver as well as £ 279,000 in lieu of pension payments			0
a further £ 101,250 was paid into his pension pot , and he received shares in the company worth £ 848,000 at today ’s price , although he wo n’t be able to cash those in for three years			2
last night a @entity3 spokesman defended the latest pay - out , saying the awards were ‘ dependent on the achievement of demanding performance targets ’ and also reflected ‘ strong business growth in the last three years ’			2
he added : ‘ over that period , @entity3 has generated post-tax profits of nearly £ 4billion , invested over £ 7billion in securing energy supplies and paid around £ 2billion in tax			1
’ earlier this year , the @entity134 revealed that the number of pensioners dying from hypothermia has nearly doubled in five years , a period when a succession of cold winters has been coupled with drastic rises in energy bills			2
official figures showed that 1,876 patients were treated in hospital for hypothermia in 2010/11 , up from 950 in 2006/07			0
three - quarters of victims were pensioners , with cases soaring among the over- 60s more than any other age group .			0

mr @entity8 ’s payment also comes despite @entity3 seeing profits fall by more than £ 1.5billion last year
