@entity0 wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee ’s calls during stops in play			1
speaking for the @entity8 event in @entity9 , the @entity11 president – who confirmed he will once again stand for re-election – says managers could , once or twice a half , question the referee ’s decision			1
when a decision is challenged the manager and referee will watch the decision on an off - pitch monitor and the referee can choose whether to overturn his decision			0
video @entity0 discussing @entity25 and @entity26 with @entity27 ahead of @entity8 new ideas : @entity0 hopes to trial the new system at the @entity32 tournament in @entity33 next year @entity0 also insisted that the ' call system ' would not work like the third - umpire in cricket , as the power to overturn would remain with the referee			1
the 78 - year - old also suggested he would like to trial the new system - which , he says , could only be used in games where television companies are present - in the @entity44 in @entity33			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity46 , he said : ‘ the next step i will propose to the international board to try and bring this so - called ‘ call ’ that the coaches or team managers have the right in the half , twice or once to have a call to challenge a refereeing decision but only when the game has stopped			2
‘ then there must be a monitor by the television company , then the referee and coach look at it and the referee may then change his mind as is the case in tennis for instance			0
continuity : @entity0 announced he is to continue as @entity11 president for the fifth term running ‘ in american football , the chief referee figure does not look at the evidence			1
that is done by someone off the pitch as it is done in cricket			0
it is referred to another referee or umpire , but you are going to engage the referee			0
‘ he can look at it , but he made the decision that was wrong so he has to change it			0
‘ i hope to bring it to the attention and hopefully we can find a league , semi-professional or professional that will try to do it			0
' it can only be done where there is television coverage of all the matches , or in one of @entity11 ’s competitions , a youth competition in @entity11 to do so , an under 20 like next year we are in @entity33 so we could test such a ‘ challenge calls ’			2

the @entity11 president wants a new system in place in football for managers to challenge referee *'s* calls
*ultimately* the power would remain in the hands of the referee though *unlike* in third - umpire cricket
@entity0 says he hopes to trial the new system at the @entity44 in @entity33 next year
