study by @entity15 says having children can make people more productive at work ( stock image shown )			1
they sampled nearly 10,000 men and women			1

they were examining the hypothesis that having children makes a person less productive			0
to make their findings the researchers sent out more than 30,000 surveys , a third of which were responded to			0
work stress - and related drinking and smoking - are taking an increasing toll on their health , according to the @entity38			0
in 1963 men were twice as likely to die early as women			0

study by @entity15 in @entity25 says having children can make people more productive at work
they sampled nearly 10,000 men and women
men were found to be least productive when they had one child and most productive when they had more than one
