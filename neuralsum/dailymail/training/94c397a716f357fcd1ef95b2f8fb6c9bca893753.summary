by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 spearheaded another one - two for @entity3 in practice , but @entity5 is threatening to spoil the @entity8 manufacturing giant 's party on home soil			1
it was a close run thing between the two championship protagonists as @entity2 finished just 0.024 seconds clear of @entity8 team - mate @entity12 following the two 90 - minute sessions at a hot @entity14 ahead of the @entity8 @entity15			1
in scorching temperatures of 32 degrees centigrade , and with the track thermometer hitting a searing 58 , @entity2 finished with a time of one minute 18.341 seconds after finally getting to grips with the circuit and the loss of @entity23			1
@entity23 enables the cars to maintain a constant ride height , and is believed to have played a role in @entity3 ' dominance so far this season			0
following a detailed investigation of most of the systems , @entity31 felt @entity23 contravenes one of the @entity32 's catch - all regulations with regard to moveable aerodynamic devices			0
in fear of a rival launching a protest , the @entity32 confirmed all teams had opted to remove the device prior to practice			2
home advantage : @entity12 takes to the @entity14 circuit ahead of the @entity8 @entity15 on the ball : @entity12 enjoys a spot of keepy - up before getting into his car for the morning 's first session on track it was immediately apparent as to its benefits as a number of cars ran wide in the slow corners due to them being forced to run a higher , stiffer front suspension			1
the @entity3 ' of @entity12 and @entity2 were high amongst those who suffered difficulties during the first session , in particular the latter			1
@entity2 was comfortably fastest in the opening two sectors , but in the third was off the pace , and so had to settle for second best behind @entity12			1
come @entity81 , and after getting used to the new feel of the car , the 29 - year - old hit back to narrowly pip @entity12 , who is aiming to complete the best week of his life			2
@entity12 , who over the past few days has got married , watched @entity8 win the @entity86 and signed a new long - term deal with @entity3 , is determined to land victory in front of his fans			1
@entity5 , however , may yet throw a spanner in the works as the @entity94 driver finished just a tenth of a second adrift , as close as anyone has got to @entity3 at the end of friday practice			1
@entity101 's @entity100 , fit again after damaging ribs and sustaining bruising following his heavy - impact shunt into a barrier on the first lap of the @entity107 @entity15 a fortnight ago , was a distant fourth , half a second down			0
@entity110 - driving a @entity109 sporting a new rear wing - and @entity112 for @entity113 were both over 0.6secs adrift , followed by @entity116 in his @entity109 , with the @entity28 0.880secs off the pace			0
life in the fast lane : @entity5 finished third in final practice on friday			2
he has impressed for @entity94 this term @entity116 was in good company as he was followed by two other world champions in @entity124 in his @entity94 and @entity101 's @entity125			0
after a successful practice outing for @entity113 development driver @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 returned to the car for @entity81 and was a second adrift in 10th			0
@entity127 , meanwhile , conjured a strong performance in @entity133 , finishing only a quarter of a second behind @entity112 , although was handed two fines for pitlane speeding			0
there was also an electrical glitch on her opening installation lap that threatened to scupper the 31 - year - old @entity141 's outing , which would have been an injustice given an engine issue ruined her maiden run at @entity144 after just four laps			0
@entity147 's @entity146 finished 3.5secs behind @entity2 in 21st , with @entity149 propping up the timesheet after his @entity151 caught fire out on track .			2

@entity2 was *marginally* quicker than @entity156 rival @entity12 in practice
@entity5 was 3rd quickest in his @entity94 at a scorching @entity14
track temperatures hit a searing 58 degrees during practice for @entity8 gp
@entity12 , fastest in the morning session , is four points clear of @entity166
