if your canine displays attention - seeking behaviour , you may have a better bond with them than owners with well - mannered pooches badly behaved dogs can be a source of embarrassment for their owners			1
but if your canine companion displays attention - seeking behaviour , you may have a better bond with them than owners with perfectly - mannered pooches , a new study claims			1
the research looked at human - animal attachment among 60 dog - owning families , including parents and children			1
it is the first study to examine attachment in children in this way			2
participants completed questionnaires to provide details about their attachment to their pet dogs , how responsible they feel towards them , and how often they feed and walk their canines			2
they were also asked to rate their dogs on behavioural characteristics such as excitability , trainability , stranger fear and aggression , separation problems and attention - seeking behaviour			1
@entity42 , assistant professor of animal behaviour at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , said that people who care for their dogs well and take more responsibility for them are more attached to their pets than those who have a more hands - off approach			1
while this is not surprising , her study also found that the more dogs act out and try to catch their owners ’ attention , the more their owners are likely to love them			1
interestingly , children were not affected by this behaviour			2
‘ children ’s attitudes and levels of attachment toward their pets remained high , even when dogs showed low levels of attention - seeking behaviour , ’ dr @entity42 said			1
@entity42 , assistant professor of animal behaviour at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , said that people who care for their dogs well and take more responsibility for them ( stock image ) are more attached to their pets than those who have a more hands - off approach adults tend to be more selective than children in the types of dogs with which they bond ‘ due to work - related and parental responsibilities that already demand their attention			1
‘ thus , adults may only form emotional attachments with dogs that seek out their attention , ’ she explained			1
dr @entity42 also discovered that owners have a better bond with their pets if their animal is well trained , but misses them when they are not around			0
if a dog likes socialising with humans , then the bond between canine and owner is greater still			0
the study did not identify any differences between men and women			0
and found that they are typically drawn to the same dog characteristics and are equally attached to their pets			0
growing numbers of people are being kept awake at night by their pets , doctors have warned			0
the respected @entity101 in the @entity102 says that while many people sleep peacefully with their pet curled up beside them , some are left so exhausted that they seek specialist help			0
snoring dogs , squawking parrots , wandering kittens , sick pets and animals with weak bladders are all disturbing vital shut - eye			2
pampered pooches may be a problem , as well as more people owning more than one pet			0
some 10 per cent of pet - owners who attended the clinic ’s sleep centre in 2013 partly blamed their animals for their problems			0
the study ’s author , dr @entity123 , a psychiatrist , said : ‘ the study determined that while the majority of patients did not view their pets intolerably disturbing their sleep , a higher percentage of patients experienced irritation			0
dogs , cats and birds were the most popular pets and kept their owners awake by snoring , whimpering and wandering .			0

research by @entity44 in @entity46 found busy adults are more likely to bond emotionally with attention - seeking dogs
but children *'s* affections were not affected by the demanding canines
study was based on a questionnaire about dogs ' behavioural traits
these included excitability , trainability and aggression
