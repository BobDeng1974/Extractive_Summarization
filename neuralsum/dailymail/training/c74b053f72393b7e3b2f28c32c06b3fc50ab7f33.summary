by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 30 march 2012 updated : 12:35 est , 30 march 2012 a foreign doctor who failed to tell his nhs and police employers about his conviction for the ' mercy killing ' manslaughter of a patient in @entity9 acted dishonestly , medical watchdogs found today			2
dr @entity10 worked for @entity11 for more than two years despite being under investigation and subsequently convicted of manslaughter in @entity9 , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) has heard			1
he injected a cancer - riddled patient already at death ’s door to ' rid her of the unbearable suffering ' and end her life while working at a hospital in @entity9 in 2005 , the @entity14 was told			1
dr @entity10 worked for @entity11 for more than two years despite being under investigation and subsequently convicted of manslaughter in @entity9 , the @entity14 has heard within a year , dr @entity10 , 52 , had come to the @entity23 and started to work for the @entity24 before getting another job with @entity26 and going to work for the police as a forensic medical examiner			1
but he failed to tell any of his new employers about the continuing police investigation in @entity9 or the subsequent court case			0
today , a fitness to practise panel of the @entity14 , sitting in @entity34 , found that dr @entity10 , who is not represented or present at the hearing in @entity34 , acted dishonestly			1
the panel will now have to consider whether his actions amount to misconduct and , if so , whether the doctor should face punishment , such as being struck off			0
within a year , dr @entity10 , 52 , had come to the @entity23 and started to work for the @entity24 before getting another job with @entity26 and going to work for the police as a forensic medical examiner the panel is not expected to give a decision until next week			0
in a letter to the panel , dr @entity10 stated he was unfamiliar with medical rules that state if a doctor has been cautioned , charged or convicted of a criminal offence , anywhere in the world , they must declare this to the profession ’s regulatory body - namely , the @entity14			1
his explanation was not accepted by the @entity14 panel			2
the doctor also told the panel in writing that he was ' afraid ' to lose his freedom and his job			0
the medic , who qualified as a doctor in @entity65 and now lives in @entity9 , has been suspended from working as a doctor by the @entity14			2
earlier , the @entity14 heard that on march 28 2005 , dr @entity10 was working at the @entity68 district hospital in @entity69 , @entity9 , when an 82 - year - old ' extremely ill ' cancer patient , referred to only as @entity72 , was admitted			1
the patient had advanced cancer of the colon and internal haemorrhaging and her family consented to her treatment by dr @entity10 for ' sedative and palliative ' care			1
in june 2007 , applying for a job with @entity26 in the @entity84 department at the @entity26 ( above ) , dr @entity10 denied there were past , present or pending prosecutions on his record when the patient became unconscious , he injected her with 60mg of potassium chloride , a lethal dose			1
@entity9 court papers said the patient was ' begging for her suffering to be brought to an end ' and dr @entity10 may have thought , incorrectly , ' she was begging him to end her life ' , the @entity14 heard			1
it took four years for the case to be resolved in @entity9 , when dr @entity10 was convicted at the provincial high court in @entity69 under @entity9 law of ' involuntary manslaughter ' and ' attempting to co-operate in the suicide of a seriously ill person whose death is imminent '			2
he was sentenced to one year in jail , which was suspended , and a further sentence of four months , 15 days ' jail , substituted by him paying a fine of 1,620 euro ( £ 1,359 )			0
but less than a year after killing the woman - by february 2006 - he lied to get a job with the @entity24			0
in a self - declaration form , he denied being under investigation , and in june 2007 , applying for a job with @entity26 in the @entity84 department at the @entity26 , he again denied there were past , present or pending prosecutions on his record			0
dr @entity10 then applied for a job with @entity11 in april 2008			2
he was required to fill in forms , with one section asking whether he had any impending prosecutions or if he was the subject of a police investigation			0
in fact he left that part of the form blank - and it appears no one at the force checked the form			0
he worked for the force from may 2008 to october 2010 until his past history came to light , uncovered by the press			0
the @entity14 has now found his non-disclosure to both the @entity134 trusts and the police amounts to dishonesty			1
the hearing in @entity34 continues .			0

dr @entity139 worked for @entity11 for more than two years
he injected cancer patient ' to rid her of unbearable suffering ' , @entity14 told
worked for @entity134 in @entity144 and @entity145
