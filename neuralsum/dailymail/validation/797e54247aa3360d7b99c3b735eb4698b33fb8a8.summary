@entity0 , tears in his eyes , a smile wide on his face , waved the @entity6 flag high , his joy unconfined			1
millions around the world shared his moment of triumph , be they @entity11 fans or not			2
even @entity14 , who was prowling around in disappointment at coming second , could understand why			1

@entity0 was right when he said he won the race ‘ fair and square ’ , @entity6 having outpaced the previously impregnable @entity19 machines over 56 absorbing laps			1
now a sport that has developed an impressive aptitude for navel - gazing , especially after the procession at @entity96 a fortnight earlier when a @entity19 one - two was expected to presage a period of total @entity100 dominance , can rest from its self - loathing criticism , at least for a while			1
the victors ’ joy and the losers ’ pain were equally piquant in the circumstances			0
for @entity0 , it was the fulfilment of the dream of a lifetime			2
he had won in the shiny red car of @entity6 , the team he grew up worshipping			1
as a boy , he watched over the fence as @entity114 drove around @entity115 , the test track at the team headquarters in @entity118 , an industrial town in northern @entity119 as blandly functional as @entity120 , @entity121			2
but it houses the spiritual legacy of @entity6 and all that is poetic about the world ’s most famous car			1
‘ i remember when the gate opened in @entity118 and it was like a dream coming true , ’ said @entity0			2
’ you would have needed a heart as hard as flint not to be swept along as he screamed over the team radio : ‘ thank you , thank you			1
’ this was the 40th win of @entity0 ’s career , but his first for the @entity11 in only his second race for the team since leaving @entity59			1
@entity33 stats provided by @entity140 @entity0 is soaked by champagne as the bottles are cracked open on the podium after the race the grid girls run for cover as runner - up @entity14 sprays champagne on the podium @entity14 ( left ) chats to race winner @entity0 during the post-race press conference in @entity151 @entity6 's @entity0 in front ahead of @entity28 compatriot @entity24 , of @entity19 , during the @entity21 @entity20 four - time world champion @entity0 on his way to a comfortable victory at the @entity21 @entity20 on sunday @entity19 driver @entity14 leads at the start of sunday 's race at the @entity158 @entity14 , of @entity44 , leads at the first corner with @entity0 closely behind the @entity19 driver re-live every lap of the @entity151 race it was ironic , of course , that @entity0 should be the man to blow the apathy away , given how he and @entity59 were so good that they were boring during four , often pulverising years of success			1
nine victories in succession in 2013 was @entity0 ’s most one - sided stretch			1
before yesterday , @entity19 had won the previous eight races straddling this season and last			2
and the losers ’ pain ? yes , it was pleasant for a change to see @entity19 panic , if only because it showed they are human			2
it provides hope for the rest			0
@entity14 was involved in tetchy radio exchanges with his engineers			1
that is what pressure , especially when it is unaccustomed , can do to even brilliant minds			0
‘ you ’ve put the wrong tyres on , ’ exclaimed @entity14 after his third and final stop			2
the team then accidentally tuned him into a private exchange on the pit wall			2
they apologised for the mistake			0
then , annoyed by the confusion , he said : ‘ once again i do n’t know what i ’m supposed to be doing			0
’ in growing exasperation , he instructed them not to talk to him going through corners			0
‘ i almost just went off , ’ he added			0
finally , they told him he could catch @entity0 in the dying laps			2
it was a crazy , false hope to express and @entity0 won by 8.5sec			2
@entity24 , who is out of form , was third , a place ahead of @entity6 ’s @entity45 , who fought from 11th on the grid and an early puncture			1
@entity14 was gracious in defeat and loyal to his team			1
the fact was that @entity6 , who were able to run a two - stop strategy , just had too much pace on the day			1
@entity14 powers his car during the race ( left ) , and then looks on from the podium after finishing in second place ( right ) @entity69 driver @entity84 , of @entity85 , spins off the circuit as he crashes out of the race the heat — 60 degrees celsius on the track — played to their strengths in a way the colder @entity227 circuit a fortnight hence will probably not			1
the ghost of the day was @entity229			0
he established the @entity19 super-team before being rashly pushed out at the end of 2013			2
the question of long - term importance is whether @entity19 can continue on a clear - headed path of success without him			1
that burden falls to @entity238 , the team principal , and @entity240 , the technical director			2
@entity238 said : ‘ there is no panic , but we were in a new situation			0
we were not in control of things today			0
‘ we had new information which was different from what we had assessed over the weekend			0
‘ it was clear the winning streak was not going to go on forever			0
it is not the end of an era , but maybe the start of a new era , of a good battle , a battle we would like to take on			0
it ’s about staying calm and trying to come back with confidence and with the speed we have had in the last couple of races			0
’ @entity229 ’s name also cropped up at @entity6 , where he masterminded the @entity114 years of unbroken glory			2
his old job there as technical director has been taken by the highly - rated , @entity269 - educated @entity268 , a tall and slightly awkward - looking @entity270 engineer			1
@entity6 's @entity46 driver @entity45 makes his way back to the pits with a blown out tyre @entity53 driver @entity51 , the 17 - year - old from the @entity52 , on his way to an impressive seventh - place finis ‘ @entity229 has about a billion championships under his belt as a technical director and i have precisely zero , ’ he said			1
‘ come and talk to me in a few years ’ time when , if i am lucky , i hopefully might have half of what he has won			0
it would be premature to say anything different			0
’ @entity285 started to oversee the development of @entity0 ’s car in january , 2013			2
since then two @entity6 team principals have been sacked			1
the third , @entity290 , belted out the @entity119 national anthem that greeted @entity0 ’s win			1
@entity285 , the subject of more interviews than in any other one - hour period of his life , summed up the mood of the day : ‘ it ’s good to win in anything but there is something absolutely fantastic about this team			1
at @entity6 , they work especially hard but we also have the history and tradition of the team bearing down on our shoulders			1
‘ everywhere you go in the factory , there is the evidence of their massive success and anyone who works there when it is not successful is cowed by that			0
‘ but there is also the weight of expectation of an entire nation			0
those things are pressures that we soak up and when the pressure is released by a day like this , boy , does that feel good			0
everybody here wo n’t be able to find proper words to express what they feel			0
’ incident 1 lap 39 – @entity14 complains about choice of tyres @entity14 : ' this is the wrong tyre man			2
' his engineer replies they had no choice			0
engineer : ' the other was well used			0
' incident 2 lap 40 – with @entity0 picking up the pace , @entity14 vents his anger again @entity14 : ' i can hear you ( in response to one engineer trying to grab a quick word )			1
i do n’t know what i ’m supposed to be doing			0
@entity240 ( @entity240 , team technical chief ) says i might be doing another stop			0
' engineer : ' that was just miscommunication			0
' incident 3 lap 42 – @entity14 snaps after being distracted engineer : ' @entity14 you are scheduled to catch @entity0 with five laps remaining			1
' @entity14 : ' do n’t try and talk to me through the corners , man , i nearly went off			2

@entity0 finished 8.5 seconds ahead of @entity14 to win the @entity21 @entity20
@entity0 , the four - time world champion , ended @entity6 's 34 - race drought at @entity158
@entity14 finished in second place ahead of @entity19 team - mate @entity24
the @entity270 world champion was heard complaining to his team over the radio during the race
@entity82 driver @entity81 , of @entity44 , was forced to retire *due* to a loss of power
