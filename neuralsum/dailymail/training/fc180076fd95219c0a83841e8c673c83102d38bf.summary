when @entity2 's friends dared him to jump in a puddle in his brand new training shoes , the worst he thought would happen was that his sparkling white and blue footwear would get a little dirty			1
but he did n't bank on what seemed to be a couple of inches of surface water being quite so deep			0
in an hilarious video clip on @entity15 , the @entity12 teenager 's attempts to entertain his friends backfire spectacularly as he ends up getting a soaking			0
as his friends film on their mobile phones , @entity2 prepares to amuse his friends by jumping in to the water			2
he smiles to his watching friends and is heard to laughingly say ' i 'll do it for the kids ' as he leaps forward			0
but instead of making a tiny splash , the youngster disappears below the surface of the puddle , and is completely submerged in the deceptively deep puddle			2
shock : the youngster emerges from the icy water and very quickly clambers back to dry land helped by one of his friends laughter : the youngster collapses to the ground doubled up laughing at the unusual incident as his pals begin to howl with laughter , unfortunate @entity2 resurfaces from the freezing water and clambers back out of the cavernous puddle back to the car park helped by one of his friends			1
as he walks away from the puddle @entity2 and his onlooking friends fall about laughing			1
the video has since gone viral on @entity15 , watched by almost 250,000 people			0
his friends say that they did n't realise that the puddle was so deep and had bet @entity2 a dollar to splash in it			1
@entity68 , who posted the video online , commented : ' we all thought it was a puddle swear to god ! ? ' hilarious : the cameraman , who can be heard laughing throughout , drops to the ground unable to control his amusement at his friend 's misfortune			0

the teenager , named @entity2 , is egged on by friends as he goes for a splash
but the puddle is a lot deeper than it appears on the surface
his friends are heard in *hysterics* as soaked @entity89 climbs from the puddle
