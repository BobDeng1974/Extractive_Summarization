there is an old wives ' tale that says the best way to tackle red wine stains on carpets and clothes is to cover them in white wine			1
and while alcohol is the key to removing a spilled glass , the solution does n't lie in a glass of @entity13			2
in a video , a scientist has revealed how gin and vodka dilute red wine stains , why vinegar is so good at removing mineral deposits on glass , and how spit tackles stubborn food stains in your kitchen			1
when higher concentrations of clear alcohol , such as gin , vodka or white rum , are poured onto the stain , the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet			1
these can then be soaked up using a paper towel the video was created by the @entity43 - based @entity42 ( @entity42 ) as part of its @entity46 series			1
it covers three household cleaning ' hacks ' for windows , carpets and counter tops			1
the first reveals an alternative to window cleaner is to add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70 per cent rubbing alcohol to an empty spray bottle			1
as the video explained : ' vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid			1
' gin : pour gin , or another high - proof clear liquor , onto a red wine stain and soak it up with a cloth			1
spit : your own spit can be used to lift food stains from counter tops or hard surfaces			1
bananas : wipe the inside of the banana skin on the spot of leather that needs to be cleaned			2
when finished , rub with a damp cloth			2
cola : pour into the toilet bowl and leave to sit for an hour to allow the acid to take effect			2
clean the inside of the bowl with a toilet brush and flush away			2
tomato ketchup : good for cleaning brass , copper and silver elements			2
rub onto the area that needs cleaning , leave to work and wipe with a moist cloth			2
mayonnaise : ideal for removing marks on wood			2
use a cloth with a small amount of mayonnaise and wipe the mark that needs to be removed			2
leave the oils to work and wipe away any residue with a clean cloth			2
@entity107 nuts : also effective on wood surfaces			1
cut a nut in half and rub vigorously over any scratches			2
potatoes : cut the potato in half and dip the side without peel into baking soda			2
when covered , firmly rub the potato on rusted areas			2
grapefruit : remove limescale by cutting the grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt			2
scrub the area and rinse with water			0
coffee : place dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid			0
place in the fridge and leave to eliminate odour			0
acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the @entity136 scale making it very acidic			0
because of this acidity , vinegar ‘ eats away ’ at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust , while the rubbing alcohol absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints			1
onto red wine stains in fabrics , the video said the key is to ' act fast and grab a bottle of the nearest high proof clear liquor '			1
this can be vodka , gin or white rum , but the important part is that whichever drink is chosen it must be higher proof than the wine that has been spilled			1
keep applying it to the stain while soaking the liquid up with a rag or paper towel until it ’s all gone			0
red wine is red because of pigments known as anthocyanins , which are alcohol soluble			1
when higher concentrations of alcohol are poured onto the stain , the colours dissolve into the liquid rather than drying into the carpet			0
as more alcohol is poured onto to the stain , the red colour dilutes completely and can be soaked up			1
@entity42 advise pouring plain water onto the carpet once the alcohol has been soaked up to remove the smell			1
elsewhere , if there is a hard food stain on a countertop or hard floor , @entity42 suggest using spit to remove it			1
inside saliva is an enzyme called amylase and it ’s used as one of the first steps of digestion			0
@entity193 speeds up the process of breaking down starches , for example			0
' you may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes or crackers that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them , ' said @entity42			1
' that ’s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills			1
' a cleaning expert from @entity209 recently revealed the science behind why certain foods are so useful for tackling rust , removing stains and tightening cracks in wood , too			1
the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) has produced a video as part of its @entity46 series that covers three household cleaning ' hacks '			1
these include how to get streak - free windows , remove red wine stains from carpets ( pictured ) and clean stubborn food stains from counter tops and hard surfaces @entity229 , @entity228 's chief executive told @entity230 that tomato ketchup is good for cleaning brass , copper and silver elements			1
' tarnishing mainly occurs due to sulphur compounds in the air , ' she said			0
' when the ketchup is applied to the metal , the natural acid in the tomatoes reacts with the oxidising of the tarnished silver , brass or copper			0
' ' potatoes and baking soda are effective at tackling rust because the oxalic acid in the potato mixes with the baking soda to help to dissolve the rust			0
' an alternative to window cleaner is to take an empty bottle and add two cups of water and a quarter cup of 70 % rubbing alcohol			0
as the video explained : ' vinegar is a fantastic cleaner and the secret to its cleaning capacity is acetic acid			1
' acetic acid sits at a 2.4 on the @entity136 scale making it very acidic ' ( pictured ) because of this acidity , vinegar ‘ eats away ’ at mineral deposits on windows including moisture and dust , while rubbing alcohol ( pictured ) absorbs greasy dirt like fingerprints , said the chemist even the weakest levels of acid can dissolve and loosen the hydrated iron oxides found in rust			1
this also means vinegar is a good rust remover			0
these foods can also replace the rust with a thin film of smooth hard oxide on the surface of the iron , to help it resist further hydrated oxidation			1
phosphoric acid in cola drinks , and citric acid in lemon juice also work			0
' banana skins are often used to buff leather , followed by a damp cloth , and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches , ' mrs @entity297 said			0
to remove hard food stains on a countertop or hard floor , @entity42 suggests using spit to remove it			1
inside saliva is an enzyme called amylase and it ’s used as one of the first steps of digestion ( pictured ) @entity193 speeds up the process of breaking down starches , for example			0
' you may have noticed when you eat certain starchy foods like potatoes that they have a slightly sweet taste when you chew them , ' said @entity42			1
' that ’s the amylase in action and the same principle can be used to break down food spills ' potassium is often found in shoe polishes too , for the same reason			1
' ideal for removing marks on wood , mayonnaise contains oils and proteins that gently diminish scratches and marks on wood			0
' they also react and cause the wood to swell , which tightens cracks in surface			0
' the oils in @entity107 nuts are also effective and act like a natural die to darken and hide scratches			0
' elsewhere , mrs @entity297 added : ' to keep a fridge smelling fresh , experts claim putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours			0
a cleaning experts has also revealed which food items can be used to clean a home			1
for example , potatoes remove rust because the oxalic acid reacts with baking soda to dissolve the hydrated iron oxides banana skins ( stock image pictured ) are often used to buff leather , followed by a damp cloth , and this is effective because the potassium in bananas is absorbed and slowly works to plump up the scratches			0
potassium is often found in shoe polishes too , for the same reason ' @entity372 substances floating around in the air attach themselves to the surface of coffee beans via a process known as ‘ adsorption '			0
' invisible to the naked eye the many tiny pores in a coffee bean create a large surface area , per unit mass. ' this gives , in chemical terms , plenty of area for the smell to adhere itself to and causes it to be cancelled out			0
' as a subsititute to limescale remover , mrs @entity297 recommends cutting a grapefruit in half and sprinkling one half with salt			0
the salt acts like an exfoliator to remove the surface limescale , while the citric acid in grapefruit acts as the cleaning agent and breaks down the scale at a more molecular level			0
and cola drinks are an effective toilet cleaner because they contains carbonic , citric , and phosphoric acids			0
many of these acids are found in household cleaning products already , and when mixed together , the reaction causes the stains to be lifted and removed			2
ideal for removing marks on wood , mayonnaise ( left ) contains oils and proteins that gently diminish scratches and marks			0
they also react and cause the wood to swell , which tightens cracks in surface			0
tomato ketchup ( right ) cleans brass and copper because its natural acid reacts with the oxidising of the metal to keep a fridge smelling fresh , the expert claims putting dry ground coffee into an old margarine tub with holes in the lid will eliminate odours			0
