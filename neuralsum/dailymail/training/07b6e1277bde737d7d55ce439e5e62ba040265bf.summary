dazzling objects : light artist @entity7 's work entitled @entity23 mr @entity7 's work entitled ' wool and water ' which he created using homemade light tools these dazzling optics were created by light artist @entity7 , 44 , who paints the sky using homemade light tools ' @entity29 ' ( left ) and ' @entity31 tunnel overload ' by @entity7 the former neurology and computing lecturer uses long exposure photography to capture the striking images , which are not photo - manipulated in any way mr @entity7 first painted the night sky in 1980s but re-kindled his passion after advances in digital photography			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' the main attraction is the fun			2
it 's very enjoyable jumping about waving lights , then rushing back to the camera to see what was captured by the sensor			0
' but the technical and cognitive challenge is also a big part of the attraction , as there are so many variables to be juggled			0
' it takes a lot of concentration , making a successful effort all the more rewarding			0
the 44 - year - old employs recurrent motifs in his art , inspired by his previous studies of neurology and prehistoric rock carvings			1
he said : ' on one level , it 's all very cerebral and abstract , in that i 'd like the images and their mode of creation to be able to say something about the relationship between human cognition and space and time , but on another level i simply like making bonny patterns			0

' the lack of post processing in my light paintings hopefully raises some questions about the way in which our perception of the real world can be skewed by digital manipulation of images			0
' mr @entity7 's nocturnal light - beaming activities have been cause for concern for many people stumbling across him whilst painting the skies			1
a work entitled ' @entity148 ' by light artist @entity7 , features leds with perspex diffuser swung on a string above a cheesegrater mounted on the camera lens ' @entity154 ' by light artist @entity7 , produced by waving handheld led strips below a railway tunnel he said : ' i have had people ask me if i am performing some obscure kind of martial art , when shooting by rivers or by the sea			1
' people have asked how on earth i expect to catch any fish with all those leds attached to the rod , on some occasions people will come over and ask what i 'm up to , and this has resulted in them featuring in some of the shots			0
' on one occasion , the images on the camera 's screen persuaded members of the constabulary that despite me waving a power drill bedecked with flashing lights , i was in fact harmless			0
