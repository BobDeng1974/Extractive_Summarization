proudly collecting her degree with a friend by her side , @entity0 looks as though she has achieved her aim of having a normal student experience			1
but appearances can be deceiving ... for the fellow ‘ student ’ accompanying the actress to her graduation is actually an armed police guard			2
and beneath the undercover officer ’s black graduation robe is a gun			0
in the past , the 24 - year - old has played down her celebrity status , claiming to have never been asked for an autograph on campus – a sign , she said , of her normality			0
but as she picked up her degree in @entity43 alongside 2,000 other graduates on sunday , she remained in constant sight of the undercover officer			2
underneath her graduation gown , the guard wore a pink shirt , jeans and trainers – far more practical , no doubt , than miss @entity0 ’s strappy heels			1
looking on : the guard sat to @entity0 's right during the ceremony , while the star 's mother @entity57 sat to her left undercover : the policewoman looked just like a normal graduate in the traditional cap and gown proud : @entity0 's mother looked to be thoroughly enjoying the ceremony in @entity67 graduation day : the guard kept a watchful eye on @entity0 's whereabouts as they strolled around the educational facility here she comes : the @entity75 actress , best known as @entity76 in the @entity78 movies , was among the 2,000 graduates receiving degrees from @entity19 on sunday all smiles : @entity0 wore a slick of pillar box lipstick for the day which accentuated her beaming smile miss @entity0 ’s mother @entity57 was also present for her daughter ’s graduation , which came after five years – and three enrolments – at university			1
miss @entity0 first enrolled at @entity19 in 2009 , before dropping out to shoot the final @entity78 film , in which she starred as the studious witch @entity76			1
then , having transferred to @entity93 – where she would meet her current boyfriend @entity94 , as well as former flame @entity96 – for another go at it in 2011 , she was cast in @entity99 and put her studies on hold once more			0
star appeal : the star enjoyed a laugh and a joke with her fellow graduates during the ceremony special day : the actress graduated from @entity19 in @entity67 on sunday long time coming : the 24 - year - old started at @entity19 in 2009 , the same year she was named the highest - grossing actress of the decade by the @entity113 what now ? @entity0 will continue building on her flourishing film career having graduated from @entity19 @entity0 had a busy film career during her time as a student , releasing both parts of @entity78 and the @entity119 , @entity99 , this is the @entity120 , and the recent @entity123 epic @entity121 clever girl : @entity0 graduated with a bachelor 's degree in @entity127 literature from the @entity129 university in @entity67 my moment : @entity0 joined her peers at the graduation in @entity67 on sunday @entity134 locks : when @entity0 was n't wearing her cap , the star 's tresses had a mind of their own home soil : @entity0 spent part of her degree studying in her native @entity75 at @entity93 it was a role she could not refuse , having waited so long to land a ‘ grown - up ’ part and being desperate for a chance to prove she could do more than the @entity78 films			1
but it would appear the third time is a charm for @entity151 , who returned to @entity19 in january and has now completed her studies			2
rebuking claims she would never graduate , miss @entity0 said last month : ‘ i do n’t care			2
this is what i want			0
and graduating will , for me , be really symbolic of all of that			0
she added : ‘ i will be there			0
and i will be throwing a huge party			0
’ big day : @entity0 , accustomed to treading red carpets , will today be one of 2,000 students walking across the podium to receive her degree in @entity127 literature from @entity19 happy day : @entity0 flashes a million - dollar smile the moment she officially graduates from @entity19 in @entity166 , @entity67 actress : this march 26 , 2014 file photo shows actress @entity0 at the premiere of ' @entity121 , ' in @entity170			1

@entity75 actress @entity0 graduated from @entity19 on sunday
she was *flanked* by an armed policewoman who wore a traditional cap and gown to blend in with the other 2,000 graduates
contrasts @entity0 's stated aim of having ' normal ' experience as a student
her mother @entity57 also attended ceremony in @entity67
