more than a dozen men who survived the worst sea disaster in @entity3 naval history - the @entity5 sinking of the @entity6 - have gathered in the cruiser 's namesake city for the final large - scale reunion of the famed ship 's dwindling number of survivors			1
thirty - eight of the 317 men who survived the ship 's july 1945 sinking and five days in the @entity19 's shark - infested waters are still alive , but they 're now in their late 80s and early 90s and many use wheelchairs			1
@entity21 , an 86 - year - old from @entity22 , @entity23 , said he and the 14 other survivors attending this year 's reunion decided friday that any future gatherings will be smaller and less frequent because so many of the survivors are in poor health			1
doomed : the @entity6 was sunk by a @entity30 torpedo in the @entity19 in 1945			1
many crewman survived the blast only to be eaten by sharks ' we decided to stay together until the last guy 's standing , but the goal is to continue at a smaller scale , ' said @entity21 , chairman of the @entity39			1
' some of the guys are in wheelchairs now and travel is pretty tough for them			2
' @entity21 said the survivors will nonetheless keep telling the story of the ship 's sinking , their survival and the role they played in helping bring the war to a close			1
the @entity6 was halfway between @entity52 and the @entity53 in shark - filled waters when a @entity30 submarine sank it with torpedoes on july 30 , 1945 , in the war 's closing weeks			1
up in the air i went , ' @entity61 , who was just 19 when the ship was torpedo , told the @entity66 about the first explosion			2
' there was water , debris , fire , everything just coming up and we were 81ft ( 25m ) from the water line			2
it was a tremendous explosion			2
then , about the time i got to my knees , another one hit			2
@entity60 ' the second torpedo nearly tore the ship in half			2
@entity61 said fires raged below deck as the ship began listing onto its side			2
rescue : of the 1,197 men aboard the @entity6 when it sank , only 317 survived after nearly a week lost at sea ' i turned and looked back			1
the ship was headed straight down			0
you could see the men jumping from the stern , and you could see the four propellers still turning			0
can you imagine a ship 610ft long , that 's two football fields in length , sinking in 12 minutes ? it just rolled over and went under			0
' just days earlier , the @entity6 had visited the island of @entity101 in a secret mission to deliver the uranium - 235 and other components for the atomic bomb later dropped on @entity106 by the @entity107 , which took off from the remote island			1
the @entity6 ' mission was so secret she sailed alone , unescorted by ships better equipped to detect and fight @entity30 submarines			1
the ship 's commander had even requested an escort but was denied by @entity117 officials			0
additionally , the @entity117 failed to pass on information that @entity30 submarines were still active in the area			0
survivors : the crew of @entity123 salute during a special burial ceremony at sea for @entity6 survivor @entity126 ' i never saw a life raft			1
i finally heard some moans and groans and yelling and swam over and got with a group of 30 men and that 's where i stayed , ' @entity61 said			0
' we figured that if we could just hold out for a couple of days they 'd pick us up			0
' the @entity6 sent several sos signals before it became submerged , but the message was n't taken seriously			1
nor did @entity117 officials take much notice when the ship failed to arrive at its destination on time			0
an estimated 900 of the ship 's servicemen survived the vessel 's nighttime sinking , but before rescuers arrived five days later , drowning , delirium , dehydration and shark attacks had claimed all but 317 of the men			1
the @entity6 ' death toll - 880 members out of a crew of 1,197 died - is the @entity117 's worst single at - sea loss of life			1
but reports of the tragedy were buried by the news of the @entity30 surrender , and interest in the ship 's story was not revived until the 1975 movie " @entity172 " featured a character who told of the sinking and the survivors ' days of agony			1
the sharks came from miles away to feast on the carnage from the wreck			0
they then started eating those who had survived the explosions			1
' we were sunk at midnight , i saw [ a shark ] the first morning after daylight			1
some of them i swear were 15ft long , ' @entity61 said			0
@entity186 , left , a @entity117 recruiter in @entity6 , speaks to @entity6 survivor @entity187 ' they were continually there , mostly feeding off the dead bodies			1
thank goodness , there were lots of dead people floating in the area			0
' we were losing three or four each night and day , ' @entity61 said			0
' you were constantly in fear because you 'd see ' em all the time			0
every few minutes you 'd see their fins - a dozen to two dozen fins in the water			1
' they would come up and bump you			0
i was bumped a few times - you never know when they are going to attack you			1
' as the sharks continued to attack , clouds of blood in the water grew and attracted more to the area , leading to even more attacks			2
' in that clear water you could see the sharks circling			0
then every now and then , like lightning , one would come straight up and take a sailor and take him straight down			0
one came up and took the sailor next to me			0
it was just somebody screaming , yelling or getting bit , ' @entity61 said			0
@entity219 , an 89 - year - old from @entity220 , @entity221 , who is one of only two ex-marines among the remaining survivors , said the horrors he witnessed - including sharks devouring men around him - became too much for him to bear after he returned home			1
reunion : 38 of the @entity6 ' 317 survivors are still alive			1
in their 80s and 90s , many are now in poor health while many survivors kept what they saw and heard to themselves , @entity219 said the lingering trauma he 'd suffered left him unable to focus on the college courses he enrolled in immediately after the war			2
' i learned early on that you had to get it out , you had to tell others what happened , ' he said			0
' once i did it was a relief			0
' @entity187 , an 87 - year - old survivor from @entity246 , @entity247 , who uses a wheelchair , had n't planned on attending the reunion , which ends sunday			2
he 'd been feeling poorly but decided monday to make the trip to @entity6 , where a black granite memorial honors the ship and its crew			1
he said that when all of the survivors are gone he hopes the survivors ' relatives and others keep reminding the public about the ship and its crew 's sacrifice			2
' somebody 's got to keep the story alive , ' @entity187 said			0
among the roughly 250 friends and relatives of the survivors attending the reunion is @entity271 , whose seventh - grade history project as a 12 - year - old from @entity274 , @entity247 , helped lead to a reassessment of the court - martial of the ship 's commanding officer , rear admiral @entity277 @entity280 was court - martialed for not sailing a zigzag course to evade submarines , but his men believed he was made a scapegoat			1
in 2000 , 32 years after @entity280 committed suicide , @entity285 passed an act clearing his name			0
@entity271 is now a 28 - year - old @entity117 helicopter pilot based in @entity23 and he said the men 's incredible story of survival convinced him to enlist in the @entity117			2
' there 's 38 of them left and i really wanted to see these guys and catch up			0
they 're like grandfathers to me , it 's like seeing family , ' he said			0
