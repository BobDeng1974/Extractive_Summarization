in the moments after @entity2 ’s 3 - 2 victory at @entity3 last april , @entity0 crowned @entity5 as the best young player in @entity8 football			1
@entity5 had scored twice and laid on another for @entity10 in a thrilling win at @entity12 , increasing @entity2 ’s lead over @entity14 to five points and six over eventual champions @entity16			1
‘ @entity5 is arguably the best young player in @entity8 football at the moment , ’ claimed @entity0 after his exhilarating performance			2
‘ if he does n’t win @entity21 it is ridiculous			0
’ negotiations over a new @entity2 contract for @entity5 have been going on for some time @entity5 's representatives are trying to get the best deal possible for their client they 've been sitting round the table trying to thrash out terms on a deal for the next five years a month later @entity30 , four years his senior , won the award after scoring 14 times in 35 appearances in the @entity34 for @entity14			1
hazard will soon sign a new contract at @entity37 after agreeing , in principle , to a five - year deal worth £ 200,000 a week			1
so what is @entity5 , promoted to @entity42 ’s squad for the @entity43 last summer and the recipient of the @entity46 award in december , really worth ? unfortunately there is no set formula			2
by amortising @entity5 ’s current valuation in the transfer market - say , for example , £ 35m - over the period of his proposed five - year contract , he could make a fairly solid case to be paid £ 7m a year ( £ 134,000 a week )			1
@entity2 ’s offer is a long way short of that			0
@entity2 manager @entity0 insists there is a ' wonderful ' offer on the table in front of @entity5 @entity5 will be laughing all the way to the bank as he can expect a huge pay rise with his new deal an alternative is for the club ’s managing director @entity67 to ask around and build a picture of the salaries commanded by some of @entity73 ’s best young players			1
for instance should @entity5 , 20 , earn more than @entity75 , the ‘ @entity76 of football ’ , according to his bellicose agent @entity78 ? @entity75 has scored 18 goals in 80 appearances in @entity81 for @entity82 and earns £ 70,000 a week , but he plays in a country that no longer has the same commercial pull as the @entity34			2
more than @entity85 , who joined @entity86 for £ 28m last summer from @entity87 and is paid £ 120,000 a week at @entity88 ? @entity85 is still only 19 and his form has dipped markedly			1
@entity90 playmaker @entity30 is set to pen a new @entity14 deal worth around £ 200,000 a week hazard has also been taking his time over talks on ha new contract to extend his stay in the @entity34 certainly more than @entity98 , who signed a contract worth £ 40,000 a week when he returned to @entity100 following his disappointing spell at @entity86			1
how about @entity102 , the 16 - year - old @entity103 who opted to sign for @entity104 last month and is commanding £ 1m a year net at the @entity106 ? as much as @entity107 , who committed his future to @entity2 on february 2 by signing a contract , laced with incentives , worth more than £ 60,000 a week ? the problem when you ask around in football about players ’ salaries is that everyone , in the words of one agent , ‘ puts a bit of @entity117 on them ’			1
on that basis , these figures may not be accurate			0
to put @entity5 ’s career in @entity42 into context , two of the best young talents in @entity127 football earn around £ 10,000 a month each at @entity130			0
@entity131 , a 19 - year - old winger at @entity133 , and @entity134 , a defensive midfielder at the same club , are two of the most promising players in @entity137 ’s @entity81 how much is @entity5 worth if @entity85 ( above ) is on £ 120,000 a week at @entity86 ? @entity127 @entity107 ( centre ) has committed his future to @entity2 on a new deal in the recent @entity143 under 20 tournament in @entity142 , @entity131 came to prominence when he scored a beauty for @entity137 against @entity146			1
like @entity5 , he belongs in the special talent category			0
if @entity131 and @entity134 make it in to the national team , they will soon be heading to the @entity34 for the really big bucks			0
@entity5 is operating in a different environment , a place where money talks for the top talent in the @entity42 game			0
@entity5 ’s progress has been so rapid , speeding past various milestones in his young career , that he is now in a position to become the highest - paid young player in @entity73			2
the problem for any club , even for an institution like @entity2 , is that when players are put on a pedestal the club becomes a hostage to fortune			0
comparisons have been made with @entity5 and @entity75 as two of the biggest young talents in @entity73 @entity131 ( left ) will rake in the big bucks if he continues to develop and makes his way to the @entity34 everybody appears to be in agreement that this is one of the most talented young players in the game			0
@entity2 ’s offer , as @entity0 revealed in a briefing before tuesday 's @entity34 clash with @entity182 at @entity183 , is ‘ wonderful ’ and ‘ incredible ’			1
that is certain to be the case , but @entity5 , who missed the game with @entity182 though injury , is entitled to wait			0
age is a constant theme in the negotiations with frequent reminders that @entity5 is only 20			0
look at it from @entity5 ’s position at the negotiating table and he will be entitled to remind @entity2 that he will be in his 26th year by the time this contract ends			1
he is in a strong position , particularly because he still has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the incoming television deal			0
if @entity5 opted to run down his contract at @entity183 , by the time the next round of negotiations with his agent takes place , the numbers swilling around the @entity34 will be on their way up again			2
whatever happens , this is a golden age for @entity5			0
@entity5 will be in his 26th year by the time his new contract comes to an end so he must plan ahead @entity5 , celebrating an @entity211 goal against @entity212 , has nine in all competitions this season			2

@entity5 's contract talks have been going on for some time
he has a ' wonderful ' offer on the table , according to @entity0
@entity5 's representatives are *fighting* for the best deal for the 20 - year - old
he has been a @entity2 player since leaving @entity224 in 2010
@entity85 at @entity86 is on £ 120,000 a week
@entity30 is set to sign a new @entity14 deal worth £ 200,000 a week
