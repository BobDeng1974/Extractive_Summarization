click here for all the big match stats from our brilliant @entity3 service briefly we had the whiff of a comeback			0
as the rain fell in @entity8 , @entity10 ’s progressive championship side , two down and seemingly finished , had just pulled a goal back on @entity13 seemingly out of nowhere			1
as is always the case in such situations , momentum had switched at a stroke			0
@entity8 found energy , @entity13 only uncertainty			1
and then , a long ball forwards from the @entity13 half prompted a race between a fresh visiting substitute with a point to prove and a 29 - year - old @entity8 defender who had spent much of the previous 80 minutes locked in sapping combat with @entity27			1
@entity28 strikes to give @entity13 the lead in the @entity32 ' @entity31 quarter - final clash against @entity8 at the @entity33 hazard fires the ball towards goal past @entity8 defenders @entity37 and @entity39 to give the @entity32 the lead on 23 minutes hazard jumps and punches the air after scoring the game 's opening goal as team - mates @entity45 ( left ) and @entity47 look on hazard salutes the travelling @entity13 faithful and is joined by @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity27 on the walk back for the restart @entity54 international @entity51 strokes his free - kick towards goal to double @entity13 's lead as @entity58 watches on the former @entity60 defender is all smiles and gives the thumbs up after scoring his first @entity13 goal since signing in the summer @entity8 midfielder @entity65 side - foots the ball home to give @entity10 's side hope against @entity13 with twenty minutes to go @entity45 places the ball into the back of the net on 82 minutes to make sure of the victory for @entity74 's side @entity45 celebrates with @entity13 skipper @entity75 as the @entity32 moved one step closer to the @entity31 final at @entity78 @entity8 ( 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) : @entity79 6 ; @entity80 6 , @entity37 6 , @entity81 5 , @entity82 6 ; @entity83 6 ( @entity84 , 84 ) , @entity65 7 , @entity85 7 ( @entity86 75 , 6 ) ; @entity87 7 , @entity88 6 ( @entity84 57 , 6 ) ; @entity89 5 subs not used : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 scorer : @entity65 70 booked : @entity89			1

referee : @entity111 7 @entity112 : @entity58 attendance : 30,639 ratings by @entity115 at the @entity33 there was perhaps only like to be one winner and as @entity118 and @entity37 hustled for the ball , arms inevitably became entwined and both tumbled to the floor			2
the inevitable question was : who grabbed who first ? replays showed that @entity118 may have been guilty while another argument suggested @entity37 had been the initial offender , placing his arm across his opponent			0
whatever the case , @entity37 was adjudged guilty by a linesman and walked the long walk			0
moments later @entity13 – a man to the good and back in control of their own nerves – scored a decisive third goal and a place in the last four of one of @entity74 ’s favourite competitions was theirs			1
certainly it was controversial and it may have robbed us of some late intrigue			0
the lesson here for defenders , though , is that in these situations , they always have the most to lose			0
better perhaps to avoid the flailing arms , the tangling limbs , and put your faith in your own turn of foot			0
failing that , perhaps , just close your eyes and hope the centre forward misses			0
here , it was an unfortunate end to what had been a gripping game			0
@entity13 had started slowly but had , for the middle hour , been imperious			2
the manner in which they have responded to their recent @entity165 defeat at @entity166 has been impressive and only a brave man would put money on @entity169 as @entity13 head west along the @entity171 from here to begin their @entity174 and @entity175 ’s programme next monday night			2
@entity8 , though , are a capable team			2
they looked sporadically dangerous with the ball and deserved to be in the contest until the death			0
ultimately , perhaps , @entity13 ’s greater quality in the final third made a greater difference than the late linesman ’s flag			2
initially , @entity8 were impressive , quick , sharp and mobile			2
by some distance , their best player was the young @entity187 @entity85			0
impossible to miss given his peroxide blond hair , @entity85 is easy on the eye as a footballer , possessing a neat touch and a decent first yard of acceleration			0
here , he troubled @entity13 for a while but was too often let down by team - mates not on the same wavelength			2
@entity13 's young defender @entity99 , pictured controlling the ball during the first half , was forced off after a nasty collision @entity13 keeper @entity97 , @entity99 and @entity8 centre back @entity81 all challenge for the ball in the air from a @entity206 corner @entity13 defender @entity99 is clattered as @entity97 punches the ball clear away from danger from @entity8 defender @entity81 the @entity210 under 21 international received treatment from @entity13 's medical staff for seven minutes shortly before half - time @entity13 's @entity214 duo @entity47 and @entity58 helped paramedics take the stretcher t the defender hazard did excellently to open the scoring for @entity13 from @entity58 ' assist			1

on other occasions , the pass in to his feet was a fraction off			0
these things can make a difference			0
and so it was that @entity13 reached the midway point of the first half having conceded ground and possession but no real chances			2
they then sprang forward to score with their first real attack of note and sadly the goal had its root in a dreadful mistake			0
captain @entity81 played an unfortunate part in the build up to the @entity255 goal that sunk @entity8 in last season ’s play - off final and he erred again here , conceding the ball unnecessarily to @entity58 on the corner of his own penalty area			1
there was still much to do for @entity13 but good teams do n’t need asking twice and when @entity58 fed the ball inside to @entity28 the @entity265 twisted to his right to create a better angle and shot low past @entity79 in the @entity8 goal			1
it was a real blow for @entity8 simply because @entity13 had n’t looked like creating much until that point			1
for the next ten minutes , however , @entity74 ’s team suddenly looked capable of closing out the game quickly			1
another chance arrived for @entity28 – the shot was dragged across goal – before left - back @entity277 hammered a drive straight at @entity79			1
@entity8 reached the interval without further setback , though , while @entity13 lost defender @entity99 to a head injury suffered while defending a corner			1
whether that shook @entity74 ’s players we do n’t know but @entity85 spurned the opportunity to punish a slow start by the visitors to the second half when he drove a low shot at @entity97 following good work from @entity87 down the right			2

in truth a @entity8 comeback did n’t look likely			0
but @entity65 swept in a super goal from 18 yards after @entity87 set him up with twenty minutes left and the tide threatened to turn their way			0
soon after came the talking point , however			0
when @entity45 swept in a rebound after @entity118 ’s low shot was parried , @entity8 supporters were still grumbling			1

@entity28 gave @entity32 the lead on 23 minutes with powerful finish past @entity206 *goalkeeper* @entity79
@entity51 doubled @entity13 's lead in the second - half with a curling free - kick to score his first goal for the club
@entity8 midfielder @entity353 pulled a goal back for @entity10 's men
@entity45 made sure of the victory for @entity74 's men , finding the back of the net with ten minutes to go
