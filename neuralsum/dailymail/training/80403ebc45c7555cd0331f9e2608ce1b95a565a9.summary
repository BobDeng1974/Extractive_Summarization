he also beat @entity10 ’s 1979 @entity9 record of 2hours 15mins 46secs , for runners aged 40 or over			0
it has been a quite extraordinary turnaround for a ‘ fat bloke ’ who decided to run the 2006 @entity16 ‘ on a whim ’ and ended up beating many younger , thinner , fitter club runners by clocking 3hrs 7mins 8secs			0
personal best : @entity0 completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon pleased : @entity0 tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the ' best day ever ' going the distance : @entity0 will represent @entity1 in the marathon at the @entity3 in @entity28 the 40 - year - old has changed his life completely in the last seven years , going from a man that had high blood pressure , smoked 20 cigarettes a day and weighed 16 - and - a - half - stone , to one of the best marathon runners in the @entity3			1
other notable @entity9 finishers include @entity38 ( @entity1 , 13th ) , @entity39 ( @entity1 , 14th ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 , 16th ) and @entity42 ( @entity43 , 17th )			2

turnaround : @entity0 was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running he now runs around 130 miles a week — averaging 11 miles a day for the past seven years — and believes he could win gold in the 100km ( 62 - mile ) @entity60 in @entity61 in november if he can clock under 6hrs 20mins			1
he is a self - confessed ‘ running nerd ’ but still struggles to define himself as an elite athlete			0
there is clearly still disbelief that he found himself posing for pictures with sir @entity67 in the athletes ’ village in @entity28 and ‘ casually ‘ ‘ hanging out ’ ’ with the guys i ’m normally watching on the @entity73 circuit — even though i ’m old enough to be most of their dads ! ’ .			0
