this is a massive game for @entity1 and this @entity3 team			1
so far he has done an excellent job and now has a very exciting team and a squad to match any in world rugby but if he could go to the @entity10 as @entity12 - winning coach it would be absolutely massive for him and the team			1
as we stand , for all his hard work and endeavour , @entity1 has won nothing whereas his opposite man , @entity18 , has won plenty of silverware and is widely regarded as the best coach in the world			1
but make no mistake , if @entity3 do win today — and i believe they will — it will make them red - hot favourites for the @entity12 and allow them to set sail for the @entity10 in perfect fashion			1
@entity3 warm up during the captain 's run at the @entity33 the day before their clash with @entity36 @entity1 could take a huge step to winning the @entity38 by leading @entity3 to success over @entity36 @entity1 knows a @entity38 triumph would be perfect for his team ahead of the @entity42 @entity1 's opposite number , @entity18 ( left ) , is widely regarded as the best coach in the world i just can not see @entity46 or @entity47 heading to @entity48 and winning , so today ’s game will go a very long way to deciding if @entity3 can begin a home @entity10 as the no 1 side in @entity53			1
in 2003 , we went to @entity56 and won well against an @entity58 side who were also going for the @entity12			2
it was unquestionably a defining moment , allowing us to arrive at the @entity10 as firm favourites and the team everyone had to beat			1
to my mind this game is every bit as important to @entity68 rugby as that			2
i ’m sure that the @entity70 will be happy with the progress @entity3 have made since @entity1 took over three years ago			1
despite some pretty conservative selections , some game - plans which were hard to fathom and the frustrations in the autumn , i believe the fans and media are also right behind him and his team			2
but heading into today ’s game , i sense a change in the air			2
there is greater expectancy than ever under @entity85 for @entity3 to win a really big game like this , especially away from home			1
it was n’t there in the autumn and it was n’t there against @entity92 where everyone seemed happy to be billed as the underdogs			2
but such expectancy makes it a defining game for @entity85			0
he and @entity3 should accept that in many people ’s eyes , including mine , they are favourites today based on the quality of their players and they should thrive on that expectation			1
@entity3 romped to a 47 - 17 victory over @entity107 in their last @entity38 game , played at @entity48 @entity3 head coach @entity1 ( right ) congratulates @entity109 ( left ) after the win against @entity107 @entity3 begun the @entity38 with a 21 - 16 win against @entity92 at the @entity112 this expectation is long overdue and it is a good thing			1
it is a sign of progress and something every great team need to become comfortable with			0
@entity1 and @entity3 need to embrace the expectation			1
@entity36 are going to have to play out of their skins to win today — that should be the mentality of this team			1
in big games like this , i always look to see if a team do something differently and unexpected in the early stages			0
it was something i always looked to engineer			0
@entity18 is an outstanding coach who is utterly meticulous with his preparation — you only have to speak to players who have worked with him to understand just how highly rated he is			0
@entity36 ’s success over the last 12 months is squarely down to him — and the level of analysis which he and his players will have done will have been huge			2
so for @entity3 to do the unexpected early on will really give @entity36 something to think about ; they will realise they are up against a clever team			1
players do not like surprises , so @entity3 need to take @entity36 outside of their comfort zone in the early stages			1
like any good business or sports leader , @entity1 has done the clever thing by surrounding himself with outstanding people			2
my confidants were @entity150 and @entity151 , who were men i admired enormously as coaches			0
i would listen to them for hours before making any final decisions , especially on selection			0
@entity1 has brought in @entity157 and @entity158 , while @entity159 was already in place			2
it is really important he allows them to challenge his decision - making process			0
but ultimately , no matter how much input you get from your coaching team , it is the head coach who makes the final decision and he must live or die by it			0
people talk about the loneliness of command and being the @entity3 rugby head coach is a lonely position			2
the buck stops with you			0
but it can also be enormously rewarding and can bring extraordinary highs as well as inevitable lows			0
in rugby , it is the best job in the world			0
i ’ve seen some clear signs of improvement and development from @entity85 who , let ’s not forget , was appointed with no international coaching experience			0
he has had to learn on the hoof and i ’m delighted by his selection of @entity194			0
sir @entity195 praised @entity1 's coaching team of @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity157 @entity195 also lauded @entity85 for selecting full back @entity194 to play against @entity36 @entity195 believes @entity3 's squad can compete at the @entity10 and beating @entity36 would be a landmark changing a winning team is never easy and it gives a firm indication he is thinking correctly and clearly			1
he needs to continue to be bold as this team are developing into something special			0
i also think he is learning the art of substitution			0
it is not an exact science , nor can it be all about pre-determined decisions of when to bring a player off			0
but it is a critical part of a head coach ’s role			0
if you get that spectacularly wrong it can have an enormously detrimental impact on your standing within the squad and the media will have a field day			0
there is a lot resting on his shoulders			0
but if i was @entity1 , i ’d be incredibly excited about what lies in store			2
this is @entity3 ’s best chance to win a @entity10 since 2003 with a tournament being played on home soil with a high - quality squad good enough to win it			1
beat @entity36 and i firmly believe @entity3 will win the @entity12 and go into the @entity10 as clearly the best team in @entity53 , with somebody having to come to @entity48 to beat them			1
lose , and all the momentum will be with @entity36			1
@entity3 need to play with tempo and an enormous amount of aggression to beat @entity36			1
they need to explode out of the blocks and concentrate on their game and not the huge prize on offer			0
do that and @entity3 will be on course for a @entity12 and a @entity42 — and lauded like no other			2
for @entity85 to earn his stripes , @entity3 must win by five points .			1

@entity3 could seize the *initiative* in the @entity38 by beating @entity36
it could provide @entity3 with the momentum to compete at the @entity10
a winning margin of five points would show @entity1 's *resolve*
