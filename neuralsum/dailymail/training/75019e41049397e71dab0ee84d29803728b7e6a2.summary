illegal immigration jumped to the front of @entity4 conservatives ' minds on saturday when a group of protesters heckled two potential presidential candidates for disagreeing with president @entity9 's recent moves on the subject			1
' if you become president , will you deport our families ? ' the group of eight shouted over and over from the balcony , after former @entity17 gov. @entity16 spoke about how he had mobilized his state 's @entity19 troops to patrol @entity22 's southern border			1
one was heard shouting ' we are @entity22 ! ' security at the @entity25 escorted them out with their signs , which read ' @entity28 ? ' – but not before the near - capacity audience drowned them out by applauding and cheering nonstop for two minutes			1
@entity16 kept talking , but no one could hear him			2
he 's staunchly in favor of increasing deportations of people living in the @entity22 illegally , and of increasing security on @entity22 's southern border			0
last week he castigated first lady @entity63 for inviting a ' deportable ' student to watch the @entity66 address from her balcony box in the @entity69 chamber			0
that comment inspired the signs			0
the protesters , from a group called @entity74 , advocate for so - called ' @entity76 , ' illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity22 as chidren			1
@entity9 announced in 2012 that he would protect them from deportation while he 's president , but @entity80 has n't passed a law to make the move permanent			2
@entity35 @entity83 told @entity84 that @entity85 and @entity44 , a 32 - year - old @entity86 man , were arrested			1
@entity85 is the group 's co-chair			2
a crush of photographers both inside and outside captured the protests and the police action in digital images			0
@entity44 , a 32 - year - old immigration protester , heckled @entity42 and was arrested the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) program stands , however , and immigration activists fear that a @entity96 - run @entity80 could throw up roadblocks forbidding the @entity98 from implementing it			1
the president expanded his controversial move in december , enlarging his unilateral action to include 5 million additional illegal immigrants , granting them residency cards and work permits			0
one activist in the balcony on saturday , later identified as @entity107 , managed to stay behind and elude security			0
ten minutes later when @entity48 gov. @entity42 took the stage , he rose and picked up where his friends had left off			1
' governor @entity42 ? if you become president will you stand with @entity53 and deport our families ? ' he shouted			1
over a quiet groan from the audience , @entity42 waited for security officers to eject the young man			2
then he quipped : ' do n't they know i 'm from @entity48 ? ' the @entity48 , unlike @entity16 's @entity17 , is far away from the contentious @entity22 - @entity123 border			1
the @entity74 coalition made a small wave in @entity35 along with @entity127 chair @entity126 @entity128 : rep. @entity53 was the protesters ' original target but he avoided them by leaving immigration issues out of his own speech @entity74 filled its @entity134 feed on saturday with promises to ' confront ' @entity53 , the @entity4 congressman			1
but @entity53 left immigration out of his stump speech on saturday , and avoided it while introducing other speakers			0
@entity53 embraced other tea party themes : ' the degredation of @entity22 exceptionalism , ' @entity9 's executive ' overreach , ' and abolishing the @entity144			0
@entity127 chair @entity126 , a @entity145 congresswoman in a shrinking @entity98 minority , held a small event across the street from the @entity150 auditorium in which she claimed potential presidential candidates on the right had come to ' give extremism a stage ' and ' kiss @entity53 's ring			0
' the @entity127 put out an online video on saturday mocking @entity53 and the @entity25 's speakers			0
a @entity35 police officer told @entity84 that the protest ' was just a handful of people			2
' ' i 've seen more energy from little - league mothers			0

' if you become president , will you deport out families ? ' a group of immigration activists shouted from the balcony of a @entity35 auditorium
two from protest group @entity74 were arrested including its co-chair
@entity180 stood and cheered for two minutes straight to drown out the hecklers – while @entity16 continued speaking and could n't be heard
@entity48 gov. @entity42 followed him and heard shouts about ' deportations ' from one protester who had n't been thrown out
' do n't they know i 'm from @entity48 ? ' @entity42 quipped
