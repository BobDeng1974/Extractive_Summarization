@entity0 stood with the trainer , @entity1 , in the parade ring			1
he tried to talk but his mind was elsewhere			2
he was waiting for the end to come			2
at 4.15pm a bell rang out			2
@entity0 did not need to be reminded for whom it tolled			1
he knew it tolled for him			2
he obeyed the signal for the jockeys to mount			2
he walked alongside @entity10 , the final ride of his astonishing career , and then clambered into the saddle			1
the tears streamed down his face but he pulled down his goggles so that nobody would see			1
he rode out on to the course			2
@entity0 was presented the @entity19 trophy by @entity20 is an @entity22 fanatic the 40 - year - old received a guard of honour before receiving the @entity19 trophy he knew this would be a strange day			1
he was aware it was being styled as a joyous celebration of the career of the greatest jump jockey there has ever been			1
‘ @entity36 , @entity37 ’ it said on the front of @entity35 ’s raceday programme			2
but @entity0 knew , too , that , for him , the day of his retirement would be a day filled with sadness and dread			1
earlier in the afternoon , he had ridden mr @entity41 into third place in the bet365 @entity44 @entity43			1
now , he had one last shot at giving @entity35 ’s biggest crowd for a decade what they wanted by riding a winner			2
so one last time , he rode a mount around the @entity53 track , racing the rest of the field and one of the red - and - blue trains that hurry along behind the tree line on the far side of the course , towards @entity61			1
a film script would have delivered his 4,358th winner but sport is more capricious than celluloid			2
and so it delivered an irony			2
the last race of @entity0 ’s career , the @entity70 , was won by @entity71 , 15 times a runner - up to @entity0 in the jockeys ’ championship			1
the two men are great friends but this was one small act of revenge for 20 years of being a bridesmaid			0
@entity0 , 40 , finished third			1
he pushed @entity10 all the way to the line and took the congratulations of his fellow jockeys as they and their horses milled around him			1
he was about to head towards the winner ’s enclosure when he was ushered back along the track			0
now the emotion really bit			0
@entity0 and @entity10 trotted back in front of the stands packed with 18,000 cheering fans			1
one man and his horse			0
there was something wonderfully moving about the tribute			0
maybe it was just its simplicity			0
an old gunslinger was riding off into the sunset			0
the champion jockey was joined by his wife @entity103 , daughter eve and son @entity105 on his last day of racing in the winner ’s enclosure , he dismounted amid scarcely controlled chaos			1
a couple of photographers had climbed the little horse chestnut tree that stands outside the weighing room and perched in its lower branches to get a better shot			0
a television reporter put his microphone under @entity0 ’s nose and paid fulsome tribute to him , telling him he wanted to thank him not just for today but the last 20 years			1
he could not speak any more			0
all day , it was impossible to get away from those themes of joy and despair			0
everyone wanted @entity0 to be happy , to depart gladly from his glory game , but everywhere he went , he looked as if he were being led to the gallows			1
the @entity128 jockey ( left ) was unable to leave on a winning note as he raced on the aptly named @entity10 it was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the @entity137 for the 20th consecutive time , by @entity20 , one of @entity0 ’s @entity22 heroes			1
some of the jockeys were in tears			1
forget all the talk of new beginnings and how this would be a brave new phase of his life			0
@entity0 was having none of it			1
he did not try to put a brave face on what was happening			0
he did not even pretend he was thinking about new beginnings			0
his mind told him just one thing – this is the end , beautiful friend			0
it has been beautiful , too			0
it has broken bones in almost every part of his body and it has demanded continuous sacrifice but it has brought him unparalleled success and universal respect			0
he stands alongside men like @entity162 , sir @entity163 , sir @entity164 and sir @entity165 as the greatest modern @entity167 sportsmen			0
it is difficult to set the parameters for greatness , particularly when trying to measure a jockey against heroes of other sports			1
but whatever criteria you use , it is hard to outstrip @entity0 for the relentlessness of his domination			1
the racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race @entity183 is probably the greatest star basketball ever and he won six @entity186 championships in two bursts of three consecutive titles			2
@entity189 was the best player in ice hockey for many years and still holds 60 @entity192 records but he won the @entity193 just four times			0
of the greats of individual modern sport , @entity195 stayed at the top of his sport for 545 consecutive weeks and @entity200 for 237 weeks			0
@entity0 stayed at the top for 1,040 consecutive weeks			1
it is hard to call an end to a career like that — and in the 11 weeks since he announced this would be his last season , he has never tried to disguise the pain			0
time and again in interviews on saturday , he said the thing uppermost in his mind			1
‘ if i could say one thing to all the guys in the weighing room , ’ he said , ‘ it would be to enjoy it as much as they can because the end does n’t half come around very quick			0
’ @entity35 was packed with punters and the media who were eager to give him a memorable send off @entity0 , who was named the @entity220 in 2010 after he finally won the @entity221 , was given plenty of opportunities to talk about the benefits a life without racing might bring			1
he did not take any of them			0
after his final race , he was ushered into a white marquee , flanked by @entity1 and the owner , @entity230 , for a final press conference			2
someone ventured his record of 20 championships in a row and 4,348 winners over jumps would never be broken			0
‘ all records are broken , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i hope i ’m dead when it happens			0
it ’ll take someone at least 20 years so i ’ll probably be in a home by then , or doting			0
’ but most of the time , he did not attempt levity			2
he said he wished he could start his racing career all over again — ‘ i have got nothing to look forward to now			0
‘ apart from my wife and kids , ’ @entity0 added , hurriedly			1
‘ @entity1 got in just in time then			2
’ crowds wee packed into @entity35 to wish @entity0 well in his final two rides a few years ago , @entity0 talked about the realities that his wife had had to live with as the partner of a man so utterly dedicated to a dangerous sport			1
he recalled the moment they had been for a fertility check and were told that @entity0 ’s habit of taking hot baths every day to sweat weight off had made his sperm count abnormally low			1
‘ @entity266 was busy putting things into perspective , ’ @entity0 remembered			1
‘ “ @entity270 is a jockey , he rides horses at 30 miles per hour over fences every day of the week , two ambulances follow him around while he works , he could come home in a wheelchair one day			2
that would be an issue			0
this is not an issue ”			0
’ soon after that , they started ivf treatment and in 2007 , @entity266 gave birth to a daughter , eve			0
on saturday , as @entity0 carried the @entity137 around the parade ring at @entity35 , @entity285 ran after him in her little white dress , outside the cluster of photographers who tracked his every move			1
‘ @entity293 , @entity293 , @entity293 , ’ she kept shouting , treating it as a game			0
her daddy did not hear her above the din			0
now , though , the din has gone			0
@entity0 is pictured in third during his last ever ride in his career at @entity35 on saturday the @entity128 jockey waves goodbye to the thousands of fans after an emotional day			1

@entity20 presented @entity0 with champion jockey trophy
@entity0 finished third on @entity10 in last - ever race on saturday
the 40 - year - old also finished third on mr @entity41 in *penultimate* race
@entity0 was reduced to tears as he competed professionally for last time
