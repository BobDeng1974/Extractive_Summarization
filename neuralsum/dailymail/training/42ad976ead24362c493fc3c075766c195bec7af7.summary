mr @entity3 gets to spend his days reading , strumming his ukulele and squeezing his trusty accordion as he plies his trade as a real life @entity12			1
after studying music and @entity14 at @entity15 , mr @entity3 is now half - way through a fortnight long stint scaring partridges from a field of oilseed rape near @entity21 , @entity22			1
field of dreams : university graduate @entity3 is working as a human scarecrow to save up for a trip to @entity27 dedicated @entity3 , who reaps a reward of £ 250 a week for his efforts , leaps into action when birds begin to circle , scaring them off with his bright orange coat as he makes a terrible racket with his accordion and cow bell			1
mr @entity3 said he enjoys being out in the fresh air and , while some friends are bemused by his new job , others are envious			2
@entity42 : @entity3 , pictured after graduating from @entity15 , says he enjoys the fresh air he said : ' i get to sit and read for a lot of the time , but whenever the partridges appear i have to get up and scare them off			1
' i ring a cowbell and i ’ve even played the accordion , but the ukulele does n’t seem to have any effect on them			0
' it ’s nice to be out in the fresh air but it can get very cold when the wind whips across the land and i have to take shelter in a wood when it rains			0
it ’s not a bad job - and a couple of chums in busier more generously - paid jobs are slightly envious			0
' mr @entity3 , who lives in @entity21 , polices the 10 - acre field for eight hours each day and is saving for a planned trip to @entity27 next year			1
he added : ' i do n’t want to be a scarecrow forever but it is giving me time to decide what i will do with my future			0
' farmer @entity72 employed mr @entity3 because conventional birdscarers had not worked			2

' partridges in particular love it - they nibble off the leaves leaving just the stalk and the plant dies			2
' a couple of years ago i lost 30 acres worth thousands of pounds			0
' we tried using bangers to scare them off but they simply come back a few minutes later			0
' @entity3 is doing a great job - you can really see the difference in the crops this year			1
