groups of vigilantes armed with guns , handcuffs and bulletproof vests are patrolling the @entity6 state border with @entity7 in a radical new attempt to keep migrants from crossing the @entity10			1
since early summer a group naming themselves the @entity12 have patrolled an area near @entity14 , @entity6			1
one 25 - year - old member , who only gave the name @entity21 , patrols the area each day carrying binoculars , an assault rifle and a glock pistol			2
a sign erected to deter trespassers hangs in the front yard of @entity26 's house in @entity14 , @entity6 a @entity29 @entity28 vehicle drives past the 18ft - high steel fence that stretches hundreds of miles along the @entity6 and @entity7 border a patch stating ' come and take it ' is sewn into the bulletproof jacket worn by a member of the @entity12 the construction worker , originally from @entity37 , said : ' if you spot them ( the migrants ) and shine your light on them , that lets them know that you 're there			1
' nine times out of 10 , they 're not going to come over			0
even if they are going to try to cross again , we 're still making it harder for them , and that 's the reason we 're here			0
' the @entity51 , a networking call center , estimates that 22 groups of ' armed patriots ' have sprung up along the border from @entity6 to @entity56 this year			1
with names like @entity12 and @entity59 , the groups often set up camp on private land along the border at a property owner 's invitation			1
expenses are generally paid by members , though some funds come from like - minded donors			2
to critics , they are militias - vigilantes spoiling for a fight			1
for would - be migrants , they are another barrier to entry			2
a member of the @entity12 , who only gave the name @entity78 , poses for a picture at a camp run by the vigilante border patrol group in @entity14 , @entity6 for the @entity29 @entity28 , they can be either a nuisance or a help in spotting people trying to enter the country illegally			1
the groups insist that their presence is unrelated to the tens of thousands of children from @entity90 who flooded across the border with @entity7 earlier this year			1
the @entity12 claim their efforts are essential because the @entity29 government has failed to secure the border			1
they bristle at the terms ' militia ' and ' vigilante '			0
' everybody has this bad taste in their mouth about ' militias			0
they think we 're out here trying to smoke people and kill them as soon as they cross the border			0
which obviously , is not the case , ' said a member who only gave the name ' @entity113 '			0
' our goal here is to try to deter them from coming			0
they see us , they do n't know who we are , so that kind of scares people away for a while			0
' the @entity12 operate on 21 acres of land owned by @entity124 , whose family has had a ranch on the border since the 1940s			1
they patrol in body armor , riding all - terrain vehicles that drown out the sound of cicadas at night			2
mr @entity134 , 66 , said ' illegals ' have poisoned his dogs and sprayed his yellow house with bullets , but he refuses to leave			0
the @entity12 carry plastic handcuffs to detain border crossers and communications equipment to inform @entity28			1
however , some say it is just a matter of time before one of the vigilante border patrol groups sparks a deadly firefight			1
tin cut out in the shape of a pistol accompanies a sign warning the homeowner does n't ' dial 911 ' hangs on the porch of @entity26 's home @entity26 and his son @entity155 look on as a neighbour 's pet raccoon jumps up at them @entity160 , sheriff of the @entity6 border county of @entity162 , said : ' when there are situations with any individual who is bearing arms in public or on private property , there is always a concern amongst law enforcement of possible misidentification that can lead to friendly - fire tragedies			1
' @entity28 has warned the groups that taking matters into their own hands could have ' disastrous personal and public safety consequences			0
' many in @entity14 live in the shadow of an 18 - foot - high rust - colored steel barrier that stretches hundreds of miles along the border			2
a few , including @entity182 , have called on groups like the @entity12 to keep an eye on their properties			1
@entity12 member @entity186 goes through a woman 's abandoned bag on the @entity29 side of the @entity10 river ' whoever says there 's not a problem by the border wall , they do n't live out here , ' he said			2
he added that his son walks around the backyard with a shotgun slung over his back to protect the family from what he says are criminals coming across the border			0
in addition to the @entity124 ' property , the @entity12 monitor homes in the area at the request of owners like @entity155 , who said it can take up to 45 minutes for a county sheriff to arrive after a call for help			2
' now , when they 're on patrol , it 's actually peaceful , ' he said			0
' the dogs do n't bark as much			0
i can actually get some sleep			0
