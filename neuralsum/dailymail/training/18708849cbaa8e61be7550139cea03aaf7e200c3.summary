perpetually rushed @entity0 have been telling cabbies to ' step on it ' for as long as there have been taxis , but the city wants to brake that hurry - up habit , in part by attacking the financial incentive to speed			1
cabs could be outfitted with black - box - style data recorders and devices that would sound warnings - or even pause the fare meter - for going too fast , even as speed limits on most city streets would drop from 30 to 25 mph			1
mayor @entity19 , who made the proposals as part of his broader safe - streets plan , says drivers of @entity0 's signature yellow cabs rightly should play a particular role in his push to curb traffic crashes			1
' they set the tone on our streets , ' @entity19 said			2
under ambitious proposals that seek to get @entity0 cabs to slow down , black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit , which is 25 mph in much of @entity39 while traffic advocates applaud the ideas , they are getting a bumpy reception at taxi stands			1
cabbies fear friction with passengers and feel they 're being scapegoated , and riders say they 're torn between the drive for safety and the need for speed			1
' when i 'm in a rush , anything is appreciated , ' @entity0 @entity56 said as she waited in a cab line outside @entity58 this week			1
@entity0 's @entity59 says it is still exploring the ideas , which would require a range of approvals			2
the traffic safety plan also includes more taxi - rule enforcers , stiffer penalties for cabbies ' driving violations and many provisions aimed at all cars , not just taxis			1
deadly auto wrecks have dropped sharply in the nation 's biggest city , from 701 in 1990 to an all - time low of 249 in 2011 , as officials redesigned dangerous intersections and made other changes			2
but recent pedestrian deaths have pushed the issue to the forefront			1

ambitious proposals seek to get @entity0 cabs to slow down by taking the financial incentive out of speeding the driver was ticketed but has n't been criminally charged , though authorities are still investigating			1
under current rules , the accident was n't grounds to suspend his otherwise clean license			0
@entity80 's mother says cabbies need to be held accountable for making streets safer			0
' they should be the best drivers in the city			0
they are professional drivers , ' said @entity102 , a psychotherapist			0
while her main goal is tougher consequences for taxi crashes , she feels black boxes and other technology could deter bad driving			2
the results would ripple through traffic , as cabbies ' driving ' dictates behavioral norms to other drivers , ' said @entity115 , who runs @entity116 , a group backing @entity19 's plan			1
while @entity0 's more than 50,000 cabbies may have a hard - driving image , they note they have eight hours a day worth of reasons to be careful			1
just about 4 percent of the roughly 200,000 vehicles involved in accidents citywide last year were yellow cabs , according to an @entity127 analysis of police statistics			0
a 2004 study showed taxis had a below - average crash rate , on a per - mile - driven basis , though a 2010 city report suggests they play a bigger role in collisions that kill or seriously injure pedestrians			2
taxi and car - service cabs were involved in 13 percent of those crashes , though they account for only about 2 percent of the cars on the road , the @entity138 report showed			2
cabbies feel @entity19 's traffic safety plan unduly singles them out for scrutiny , a sentiment hardly lessened when a news camera caught the mayor 's official , police - driven vehicle speeding two days after he unveiled the plan			1
and taxi drivers and owners fear slowing down could mean losing business			1
' people want to go , hurry , because they do n't have a lot of time			0
they spend money to save the time , ' says @entity162 , a cabbie for 21 years who says he makes sure to know traffic rules			0
he fears a lower speed limit could lengthen taxi trips enough that ' who 's going to want to sit in the cab ? ... they 'll go to the bus			0
' the drivers ' union , the @entity174 , and the @entity175 owners ' group raised some red flags at a @entity178 hearing , though the owners ' organization supports the lower speed limit and some other ideas			0
some limousine and car - service fleets around the country have seen accidents drop by 50 percent or more after installing data recorders , said @entity188 , a former @entity0 taxi commissioner who 's now president of the @entity189			1
but the devices can be unpopular with drivers and can bump up against legal questions in an industry in which many drivers are independent contractors , not employees			2
black boxes inside cabs would shut the toll meter off whenever a cab goes above the posted limit - 25 mph in much of @entity39 - and drivers would be alerted they are going too fast it 's unclear whether anyone has developed devices linking speed and fare meters , but experts say it 's feasible			1
vehicle security - camera company @entity211 , for example , recently started offering a feature that can send a cab company a message if a car breaks the speed limit , discerned by a combination of @entity218 and speed - zone maps , vice president @entity209 said			2
the @entity221 , @entity222 - based company has mapped @entity223 , @entity224 and a handful of other cities so far			0
the system could be adapted to pause a meter if regulators allowed it , @entity209 said			0
meanwhile , cabbie @entity230 relies on his own anti-speeding system : himself			0
after 32 years behind a taxi wheel , he simply says no if a passenger urges him to speed or break other rules			0
some riders gripe , he said , but many understand			0
' they sit back , relax , let us do the driving			0

ambitious new proposal made by @entity0 mayor @entity19 this week
could see black box - style recorders put in taxis
devices would sound or even pause the meter when drivers go too fast
proposal inspired by pedestrian deaths , not car accidents
cabbies fear boxes would mean loss of business and more people taking the bus
