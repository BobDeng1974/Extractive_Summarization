’ mr @entity2 , 70 , made his comments during a wide - ranging interview about his career at a public meeting of the @entity32 in @entity33			2
reflecting on his @entity3 career , he said he was often infuriated by the layers of bureaucracy that require journalists and editors to adhere to strict guidelines rather than exercise their own judgment			1
he said : ‘ we did n’t have the word " compliance " in the past			0
i ’m deeply uneasy about it			0
‘ as far as i ’m concerned if you ’re the editor of the today programme , you make decisions based on your knowledge and judgment rather than go through a book and say " am i fully compliant ? " ‘ there is an amazing amount of box ticking and it worries me			0
‘ i wo n’t say there have n’t been times when i ’ve used fairly robust language on the editorial floor and made my views clear to my superiors			0
’ asked whether the @entity3 should be slimmed down , mr @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s too big			1
we could take out a third of it i think			0

we could cut out layers of management and still produce the news			0
’ mr @entity2 also criticised the @entity3 for failing to put enough women on air , particularly after they reach middle age			1
last year , @entity70 joined the today team , bringing the number of female presenters on the programme to two , compared with three men			0

‘ i look at breakfast tv and i see a sea of young shining faces			0
where are the older women ? ‘ look at all the newsreaders			2
@entity88 started as a beautiful young presenter			0
‘ she is still beautiful but she is n’t as young			0
there are are n’t any older women reading the news			2
’ mr @entity2 ’ comments are just the latest in a string of stinging attacks by current and former @entity3 staff			1
in november , presenter @entity97 called on director general @entity98 to slim down the corporation and hand parts of the licence fee to its commercial rivals			1

’ mr @entity2 also criticised the high levels of pay earned by @entity3 stars , singling out @entity109 , who earned £ 18million while he was at the corporation			1

‘ i remember i had lunch with the former director general ( @entity134 ) shortly after i first commented on that and he just did n’t see it			0
’ asked whether he thought the @entity3 ’s funding could be cut when its charter is reviewed in 2017 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i think the licence fee will continue			1
i think questions will be asked again , as they should be , about the strategic direction of the @entity3			2
‘ i profoundly hope it does ( continue ) because if it does n’t that ’s the end of the @entity3 as we know it			1
‘ will it be in line with inflation , will it be a generous settlement ? i suspect probably not			0
