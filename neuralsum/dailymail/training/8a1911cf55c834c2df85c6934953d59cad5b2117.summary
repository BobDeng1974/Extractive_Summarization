' it 's a massive challenge , easily the biggest thing i 've ever done			1
i 'm not a particularly competent or confident swimmer but i love the ocean and i love a big challenge			1
it genuinely is into the realm of the unknown			1
' it does scare me because i really do n't know what is going to happen			1
only one person has done this but that is what attracted me towards this			1
' i do need adventure			1
some people do n't quite understand that but it 's the only thing i 'm good at , spending long times pushing myself mentally and physically			2
taking the plunge : the tv daredevil practises his front crawl in the @entity7 lake where this summer 's @entity36 open water swim event will be held water babies : a wetsuit - clad @entity1 hoists his two - year - son @entity31 on to his shoulders while wife @entity28 carries their daughter @entity32 , one ' @entity70 and loneliness will be the biggest obstacles			2
psychologically it will be very hard			2
then of course there is the physical damage on the shoulders and the arms , salt burn , icebergs , sharks - all of those things are factors as well			2
' @entity1 's previous escapades have included rowing across the @entity4 with friend and @entity36 star @entity88 , as well as racing to the @entity89 , which led to him suffering frostbite to his nose			2
the tv daredevil has also competed in the @entity94 and has swum from @entity95 to @entity96			2
gruelling : @entity1 will swim for a punishing 12 hours a day , sleeping on a support boat manned by volunteers he will undergo a tough training schedule over the coming months in preparation for his @entity4 swim in 2013			2

his journey will also aid homeless charity @entity109 as he gives several young homeless volunteers the skills and opportunities to work on the project as both his short support team and yacht crew			1
his body will also carry sensors to allow scientists from the @entity119 to do research into temperatures , currents and marine organisms			0
and he will work with the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) and the @entity125 to use the trip to highlight the fragile state of the seas			0
@entity1 - who first found fame as a participant in the @entity132 series @entity133 in which he lived on the island of @entity135 - said : ' you get out of life what you put in and the greatest achievements come from the biggest challenges			0
' if i can complete it , it will be the culmination of a childhood dream and the completion of an @entity4 circle that began in the @entity4 in 2000 where i spent the year on @entity135			1
' having rowed east to west , i will complete the circle by swimming west to east back home to @entity23			1
' @entity148 , chief executive of @entity109 - which works with 1,200 young people each year - said : ' being part of @entity1 's team and entrusted with new responsibilities will be life - changing for the young people who join him			0

' coming through : the 28 - year - old dodges some of the @entity5 's resident waterfowl as he kicks off months of preparation @entity164 , head of marine at @entity124 , said : ' our seas are under severe pressure from overfishing as well as unsustainable and poorly planned development , and @entity124 is proud to support our ambassador @entity1 's challenge to raise awareness around the issues affecting our seas and to highlight the pressing need to safeguard the future of these and other marine species and the diverse ecosystems that support them			0
' @entity1 - who was a torch bearer on the first day of the olympic torch relay across the @entity182 - added : ' i hope the swim will continue to inspire people to push their boundaries , to aspire and to achieve			0
' i hope that it captures the imagination , reminding us that adventures can still be had			0
' @entity1 said the ocean was inseparably linked to his life and career			0
completing the circle : @entity1 ( right ) with @entity36 rowing gold medalist @entity88 during their row across the @entity4 in 2006			0
seven years on , he will swim back the other way he said : ' my career started in the @entity4 in the @entity200 when we were marooned for a year and it then took another turn when i rowed the @entity4 with @entity88			0
' i think for an island nation we 've lost our affinity to the ocean and i want to recreate that			0
' @entity1 has already travelled to the @entity208 in the @entity4 to train and will also do some of his training swimming in the @entity210 , off the coast of @entity212			0
the exact starting point and date of the swim will be dependent on the weather and ocean conditions .			0
