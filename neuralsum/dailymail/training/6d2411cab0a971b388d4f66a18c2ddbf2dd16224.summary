by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 09:01 est , 27 february 2013 a popular punk rocker has told of his shock at catching a tapeworm which burrowed into his brain and had to be removed in a major operation			1
@entity6 , lead singer of @entity8 group @entity7 , feared he had cancer after suffering two seizures on his way to a gig			1
after the growth in his brain was removed , he discovered that it was an egg from a pork tapeworm - but since he is a vegetarian , he was baffled as to how the parasite entered his body			1
it later emerged that the tapeworm had apparently come from a vegetarian burrito which mr @entity6 had eaten in @entity21 which had been contaminated by the person who cooked it			1
scar : @entity6 's head after the singer underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his brain the 40 - year - old singer has released eight albums with @entity7 , one of @entity8 's leading punk groups			1
along with his bandmate @entity33 , mr @entity6 used to present a radio show on station @entity35 the rocker took to @entity38 yesterday to post a comprehensive 1,000 - word account of his ordeal after catching the parasite			2
he said that his first hint of health problems came on february 25 , when he started feeling unusual and having difficulty seeing			0
after he failed to recognise the coins he was holding in his hand , a friend stepped in and made sure he was safe while he endured two seizures			0
agony : mr @entity6 , pictured performing last year , suffered two seizures after catching a tapeworm mr @entity6 was taken to hospital , where doctors gave him a brain scan and discovered a 1cm object which appeared to be a tumour			1
' worst case would be a malignant melanoma , the best would be a benign tumour or an infection of some kind , ' he later wrote			0
however , when he was operated on three weeks later , he was relieved to be told that the growth was not a tumour but a cyst			1
doctors later told him he had been infected with @entity65 , the pork tapeworm , during a trip to @entity21 , despite the fact that he does not eat meat			1
surprise : mr @entity6 was afflicted with the pork tapeworm despite being a vegetarian taenia solium , known as the ' pork tapeworm ' , is native to pigs as well as humans			1
it lives in the intestines , and is usually caught by pigs when they eat human faeces contained the worm 's eggs			0
the most common way for people to become infected by @entity65 is eating the meat of an infected animal which has not been thoroughly cooked			0
the worm can grow as long as seven metres and lives in the intestine for years			0
its eggs frequently migrate into muscle and brain tissue , causing cysticercosis - the formation of cysts which isolate the egg from the rest of the body			2
these cysts can cause muscle pain , and when present in the brain induce seizures			2
mr @entity6 posted a vivid description of the infection process : ' so the tapeworm eggs live in pig flesh ( most common in @entity106 but found in loads of other countries too ) , the pig is killed and the meat undercooked and eaten by old mate			2
' old mate grows a tapeworm in his intestine which eventually produces eggs			0
old mate goes to @entity115 , does n't wash his hands properly then busies himself cooking my vegetarian burrito			0
' once the egg had made its way to mr @entity6 's brain , his body formed a cyst around it to isolate it , which remained in place for four years			1
however , when the cyst grew large enough to press on his brain , it caused the debilitating seizures which he suffered last month			1
the singer now appears to have fully recovered after a period of weakness in hospital following his operation			0
' i do n't feel like i 've retained any deficits from the brain surgery but i guess only time will tell , ' he wrote			0
' perhaps the slice will be taken out of my golf swing			0
my friend @entity142 thinks i will become racist			0
' mr @entity6 also joked about possible nicknames based on his experience , including ' @entity145 ' , ' @entity146 ' and ' @entity147 ' .			2
