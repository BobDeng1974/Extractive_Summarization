by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 7 september 2013 with its glorious garden , thatched roof and an out - of - the - way location in rural @entity5 , @entity1 could n’t be further from the @entity6			1
but this quintessentially @entity8 country cottage was once home to the acclaimed film director @entity10 who worked with names such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
‘ not a lot happens here , ’ says current owner @entity15 of the sleepy hamlet of @entity17 that includes just 60 homes , a @entity20 church and a community hall			1
idyllic : @entity1 , located in @entity17 , @entity5 , is on the market for £ 545,000 ‘ it ’s an 18 - mile round trip to the nearest shop , ’ he laughs			1
@entity10 bought the house shortly after making his fortune on @entity30 , so perhaps it was just the peace and quiet that he craved			1
the director , who started his career as a runner at @entity36 at the age of 12 , was the third choice to direct @entity30			1
two earlier directors had walked off set leaving the production in a state of near collapse			2
a disaster movie about a capsized luxury cruise liner whose passengers have to escape from the upside - down vessel , it was his biggest commercial hit and made him more money than any of his other projects combined			2
he had already directed @entity52 in @entity53 and collaborated on the screenplay of @entity55			2
@entity57 home : @entity58 and @entity59 in the 1972 blockbuster @entity30 , directed by former @entity1 owner @entity10 @entity1 , once owned by the neighbouring farmer , was originally built in the 1500s			1
it was completely renovated and extended in 1971 and owned briefly by an army officer and his wife before @entity10 bought it in 1972			1
@entity15 ’s neighbours , who have had a home in the village since the 1960s , recall that @entity10 appeared to have left his wife and would spend weekends there with his beautiful girlfriend and her sister , all arriving in his @entity75			1
tragically , his girlfriend was to become ill with cancer and died , leading a heartbroken @entity78 to sell the cottage in 1975 and move to @entity80 where he lived until his death in 2010 at the age of 99			2
‘ he became quite integrated in village life , by all accounts , ’ says @entity15 , 78			0
‘ he went round taking photographs of all the houses , which he printed and mounted for an exhibition in the community hall			0
‘ presumably after his girlfriend died it was too sad for him to stay here and he moved to @entity92			0
had that not happened he would probably have stayed here a long time			0
’ old school : the cottage has three bedrooms and still has many of the original features , such as the beans and a wood burning stove @entity15 adds : ‘ they had created a beautiful @entity101 garden of rose trees			0
sadly that had died off by the time we came to live here in the 1980s , but my wife was a keen gardener and planted the garden so that there is always something in bloom from march onwards			0
’ @entity15 , a retired insurance broker who used to commute from the cottage to the @entity112 , has lived in @entity1 for 26 years and is now selling up for £ 545,000			1
he is moving to a retirement village in @entity114 , following the death of his wife @entity116 last year			0
amazingly , the same estate agent who sold him the property in 1987 is now selling it on his behalf			2
according to @entity122 of @entity123 & @entity124 , the area is still popular with commuters , attracted by the proximity to @entity128 station and the journey to @entity130 , which is just over an hour			0
he says that prices in the area dropped down to 2006 levels after the housing bubble burst in 2008 and that the increase currently seen in the @entity137 area has yet to filter down to @entity5			1
‘ it could be another couple of years before prices catch up , but things are certainly getting a lot better			0
we ’ve had a phenomenal summer of instructions and sales , ’ he says			0
the three - bedroom cottage has lots of original features including beams , an inglenook fireplace and a wood - burning stove that was once a bake oven used communally by the village at the beginning of the last century			0
@entity15 says : ‘ i have to admit , i have sat here by the stove and watched @entity30			2
