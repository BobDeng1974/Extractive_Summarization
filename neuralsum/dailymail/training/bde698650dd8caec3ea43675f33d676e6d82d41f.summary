by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity1 have delivered another blow to @entity4 ’s long supremacy of subscription tv football by signing former @entity6 and @entity8 midfielder @entity7 as a pundit on a four - year contract			1
@entity1 plan to make the most of @entity7 joining their team by pitching him as the network ’s answer to @entity17 , his former team - mate for club and country , who has proved so successful on @entity4			1
but while @entity17 uses touch - screen technology to support his analysis , @entity1 will rely on @entity7 ’ forthright views to attract viewers			1
and in an online @entity48 column for bookmakers @entity49 , his views set the @entity8 news agenda			0
@entity7 said that @entity51 had not improved since breaking into the @entity53 side and that @entity54 was no longer an automatic choice for @entity8			0
it is a considerable coup for @entity1 to attract @entity7 as a regular analyst next season , especially as he made his recent reputation as a pundit on @entity4			1
in a separate deal , @entity7 will be also be working for @entity33 on their @entity36 coverage			1
his @entity1 debut is likely to be @entity6 ’s opening @entity66 game at home to @entity68 on august 16 — manager @entity69 ’s first match in charge			2
@entity1 are understood to have made @entity7 a lucrative offer , whereas @entity4 were only interested in using him occasionally			1
but the chance of working on the @entity36 , for which @entity1 have all the live @entity75 rights from the 2015 - 16 season — taking over from @entity4 and @entity33 — is said to be the main attraction for @entity7			1
will he stick the boot in ? @entity1 and @entity33 will hope @entity7 is as combative in the studio as he was on the pitch may 2014 criticises @entity51 and says @entity53 are ‘ a million miles away ’ from winning the title			2
may 2014 mocks @entity84 ’s moaning over @entity85 ignoring his birthday , saying ‘ maybe the big lad just needs a cuddle			0
’ june 2014 doubts @entity8 manager @entity90 ‘ has the b * * * s ’ to drop @entity54			0
his arrival gives @entity1 a formidable line - up alongside ambassadors @entity93 , who impressed as a pundit for @entity96 during the @entity48 , and @entity97 , who will make a number of appearances as an analyst			0
@entity101 , @entity1 ’s senior executive producer , said : ‘ @entity7 has proved himself to be a forthright and astute pundit since he hung up his boots			2
‘ his opinions have been every bit as tenacious as his tackling on the pitch			0
‘ it is fantastic that we have been able to sign up a legend like @entity7 to offer a unique insight based on a record of consistent success at the highest level of the game			0
’ @entity33 director of sport @entity116 said : ‘ @entity7 brings his phenomenal expertise and insight to our team and we ’re all looking forward to working with him			0
