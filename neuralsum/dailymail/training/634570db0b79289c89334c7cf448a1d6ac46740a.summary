@entity1 artist @entity0 was revered for his strikingly realistic 17th century paintings because they were able to capture light and detail like never before			1
yet in 2006 fellow artist @entity6 stirred up controversy by claiming @entity0 was only able to paint this well because he used a lens and mirror contraption – similar to a camera obscura			1
since then art critics have come out in support of both @entity0 and @entity6 , but one inventor now claims to have finally solved the mystery – and he is 95 per cent sure @entity6 ’s theories are correct			1
pictured is @entity0 's ' @entity21 ' inventor @entity22 , 58 , was given @entity6 ’s book @entity24 : rediscovering the @entity26 by his daughter in 2002 , according to a report in @entity29			1
@entity22 claimed he had a hunch that what @entity6 was saying about @entity0 was true and then one day while in the bath , he realised that the images could be created by projecting the subject through a lens onto a mirror that would have been positioned in @entity0 ’s line of sight			1
the @entity40 - born production editor then travelled to @entity41 to look at @entity0 ’s work , studied the locations where @entity0 painted in his hometown of @entity45 , and learned to read @entity1			1
' looking at their vermeers , ' he said ' i had an epiphany			0
' ' the photographic tone is what jumped out at me			0
why was @entity0 so realistic ? because he got the ( colour ) values right			2
' @entity22 also tested out various contraptions to discover which was the most likely			2
video : @entity56 discusses @entity22 's @entity0 a camera obscura is based on the principle that when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material , they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole			1
in 2006 artist @entity6 accused @entity0 of using a contraption similar to this one of the strongest counterarguments against @entity6 ’s claims was that if @entity0 had used a camera obscura , the image would have been upside down , but @entity22 discovered that using a second mirror solved this problem			1
his final design , which @entity22 claims he is 95 per cent sure would have been how @entity0 would had painted his masterpieces , involves two mirrors and a four - inch lens			1
the image is projected through the lens onto a 7 - inch concave mirror fixed to the wall opposite			2
this mirror bounces the image onto a smaller 2 x 4 - inch mirror situated next to the canvas			0
if @entity0 used this system , he would have been able to paint with little movement of his head and capture the light and detail more accurately			2
early models of the camera obscura were large ; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent			2
by the 18th century , following developments by @entity101 and @entity102 , more easily portable models became available to test his theory , @entity22 has spent the past decade – a total of 220 hours - recreating the room @entity0 would have painted in and attempting to recreate his 1662 painting @entity21			1
he also made lenses that would have been made using 17th century techniques and only painted with pigments available in the late 1600s			1
@entity110 illusionists @entity108 and @entity56 installed cameras in @entity22 's studio to record everything			0
they now plan to turn the footage into an 80 - minute film			0
the film , named ' @entity117 ' will be released in february			0
if you go into a dark room on a sunny day and make a tiny hole in a window , you ’ll see a strange effect on the opposite wall – the world outside the window will be shown upside down			0
this is because light travels in a straight line			0
when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through a small hole in thin material , they reform as an upside down on a surface parallel to the hole @entity140 philosopher @entity139 is thought to be the first person to mention this phenomenon in the 5th century @entity143 in 13th - century @entity144 , @entity138 described the use of a camera obscure for the safe observation of solar eclipses			0
in 1490 @entity149 gave two clear descriptions of the camera obscura in his notebooks			2
early models were large ; comprising either a whole darkened room or a tent			0
by the 18th century , following developments by @entity101 and @entity102 , more easily portable models became available			0
unlike tradiational models , @entity0 's camera obscura would have used two mirrors and a four - inch lens			1
the image would have been projected through the lens onto a 7 - inch concave mirror fixed to the wall opposite			0
this mirror bounced the image onto a smaller 2 x 4 - inch mirror situated next to the canvas			0
if @entity0 used this system , he would have been able to paint with little movement of his head and capture the light and detail more accurately .			2

@entity0 was *renowned* for his realistic 17th century paintings
in 2006 artist @entity6 accused him of using a camera obscura
this would have made it easier to paint details and capture colour *variations*
@entity22 spent the past decade trying to recreate @entity0 ’s @entity187
he is now 95 per cent sure @entity0 used a lens and mirror contraption – proving @entity6 ’s theory
