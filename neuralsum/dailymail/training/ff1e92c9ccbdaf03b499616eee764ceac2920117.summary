loanee @entity3 and @entity15 were both on target as @entity39 's side extended their unbeaten run to three matches			1
after a drab first half the hosts came out all guns blazing in the second period , going close through @entity15 just after the interval			0
the @entity47 under - 21 international was denied by a superb stop from @entity50 with his free - kick looking destined for the top corner			0
clinical : @entity15 finished with aplomb from the penalty spot to give @entity1 a two - goal lead combative : @entity8 gets stuck in during the game at @entity58 raring to go : @entity10 will be itching to get his career back on track with @entity39 just five minutes later and the hosts did take the lead though , with @entity3 tapping home from close range from @entity11 's inswinging corner			1
and just over a minute later the @entity1 doubled their advantage after they were awarded a penalty when @entity3 was taken down in the area			2
the impressive @entity15 made no mistake from the spot coolly slotting home as they inched ever closer to a second successive pre-season win			0
the hosts were unfortunate not to receive another spot - kick after @entity75 looked to be taken down , before @entity19 went on the counter-attack up the other end going close through @entity26 - who dragged his shot just wide of the far post			0
@entity1 did manage to hold on for a clean sheet though as they recorded another encouraging victory , with their next fixture a trip to @entity84 on the opening weekend of the @entity85 a week today .			1
