by @entity1 reporter published : 04:29 est , 21 september 2013 updated : 08:09 est , 21 september 2013 confined to tiny , filthy cages and suffering from skin infections , this is how farmers are treating @entity7 civet cats which produce one of the most expensive coffees in the world			1
the shocking conditions were discovered by animal investigators on farms in @entity14 and the @entity15 which produce the much sought - after kopi kuwak , sold in @entity17 and which can cost up to £ 60 a cup in some restaurants			1
locals pick the ‘ coffee beans ’ from the faeces the cats which eat the ripe coffee berries as part of their diet			2
once they are cleaned they are roasted			0
the coffee they produce is described as filled with a deep , mellow flavour , not acidic , with a ‘ unique , soft , sweet taste ’			2
however , undercover video footage shows civets exhibiting neurotic behaviour such as incessant pacing , spinning and head - bobbing – indications that the wild - caught animals are going insane from boredom and depression			1
an investigation found the animals , which produce the sought - after kopi kuwak coffee , suffer in appalling conditions distressed : investigators from @entity51 found cats injured , pacing and showing signs of depression frightened : the coffee beans are produced from the civet cats ' excrement and can cost up to £ 60 a cup cramped : the coffee has become popular among the rich and famous - but these pictures shine new light on how the expensive delicacy is produced one farmer explained civets are generally kept caged for around three years			1
another farmer compared civets eating too many coffee berries to humans smoking , as the civets ' health deteriorates greatly during captivity because of a lack of vitamins and nutrition			0
despite the battery farm conditions , many farms sell the product as ' wild ' , sourced in the jungle from the droppings of free - roaming animals			1
@entity81 , former coffee trader and author of ' coffee : a @entity84 ' , told the @entity85 : ' the whole reason everybody regurgitates that story is that by being incredibly rare , you can keep a ridiculously high price			0
' the coffee has surged in popularity , especially in the @entity93 and @entity94 after featuring on the @entity95 and the film , @entity97			0
in a separate investigation by the @entity85 , it was found one of the most popular products called @entity102 , which is supplied to @entity17 , was being produced by a company , @entity104 , which uses caged civets			1
trapped : the animals are fed vast amounts of berries , which help produce the rich and distinctive flavour of the beans dark secret : the final product is often sold as ' wild ' - but these images prove the cats are anything but free - range confined : cats are kept in tiny cages for most of the day workers said some civets were kept enclosed , despite initial denials from the company , which later backed down and admitted it did use cages			1
however , it said the product supplied to @entity17 came only from free - range animals and animals were put inside only to study their behaviour			1
the comapny said in a statement : ' in our caged civet cats programme , we study the animal behaviour , diet and its breeding behaviour			0
' in order to sustain or meet the demand for this market , we breed our own civet cats and then release them in our farm when they are mature enough			0
' we do not sell any of the coffee beans from the caged luwak as it is against our business model			0
' let me out : industry experts are convinced non-wild civet coffee has ended up on the @entity151 market money spinner : @entity17 is among the shops to sell the delicacy in @entity151 but it insists its product is entirely ethical no hope : this cat looks particularly unhappy as it peers into the camera lens of an animal cruelty investigator there is no suggestion of animal cruelty on the company 's estate			1
@entity17 said : ' @entity17 works closely with all its suppliers to ensure the highest standards of ethical sourcing , production and trade are maintained			2
this is carried out through strict auditing procedures			0
' our exclusive supplier … has given @entity17 every assurance the coffee we are provided with is organic , and comes from wild palm civets			2
' shop : @entity17 said it was confident in its suppliers			2
the up - market shop sells the beans which can fetch more than £ 300 a kilo @entity51 @entity182 associate director @entity181 said farms which do enclosed civets were cruel			1
' confining civet cats for years – as they go mad and lose their fur from the stress – for an expensive coffee would turn the stomach of any compassionate person			0
' in the wild , civets frequently climb trees to reach the ripe coffee berries , but in captivity , they are fed more of the fruit than would ever be natural for them .			0

footage shows them with infections and going ' insane ' from boredom
