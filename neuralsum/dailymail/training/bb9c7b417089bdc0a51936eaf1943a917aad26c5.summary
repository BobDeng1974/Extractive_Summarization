published : 06:51 est , 15 september 2012 updated : 07:44 est , 15 september 2012 the smell of a zesty ripe lemon , freshly brewed coffee , or flowers in a summer garden is a pleasure many of us take for granted daily			1
but one woman is rediscovering the delights of all of her favourite aromas after @entity11 surgery at a pioneering clinic restored her sense of smell after almost four decades			1
@entity16 cook @entity15 , 65 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , realised the operation was a success when she was suddenly able to smell lemon she was zesting to make lemon and sultana scones			1
@entity24 : june @entity15 has recovered her sense of smell after 37 years following new pioneering surgery mrs @entity15 lost her sense of smell and taste when she developed the condition chronic rhinosinusitis in 1975 just before the birth of her second daughter			1
but amazingly the grandmother still won prizes for cooking , despite being unable to smell or taste anything she made			2
she said she actually got her pleasure from her food giving satisfaction to others			0
mrs @entity15 also refused to let her condition stop her from training and working as an aromatherapist , treating her clients with plant oils			1
the problem , which left her unable to breathe through her nose and aggravated her asthma , failed to be cured by three operations to remove growths from her nasal passages			2
but after an extensive operation to clear polyps - abnormal growths of tissue - from her sinus cavities at the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity18 , her sense of smell returned			1
mrs @entity15 underwent surgery as a patient at @entity62 's only @entity61 and @entity63 at the @entity57			1
the pioneering clinic is helping diagnose and treat people from across the country that suffer from a condition called anosmia - the inability to detect odours			0
small instruments were used inside the nose to take out each polyp , and surgeons then washed out mrs @entity15 ' sinuses			1
mrs @entity15 is now rediscovering a world of smells and scents , and the powerful effect it has had on her emotions and sense of taste			1
blossoming : mrs @entity15 's sense of smell is finally allowing her to enjoy her favourite scents again , including her flower garden she said : ' i just keep having these amazing experiences			1
i can honestly tell you it 's like i 'm living in a different world			0
' i never thought that this would be an experience i would ever have after 37 years of no sense of smell at all			1
i 'm just taking full advantage now to be able to smell everything and taste everything			2
' mrs @entity15 underwent her latest three hour operation on june 26 and did not held out any hope that it would be a success			1
but her sense of smell suddenly returned at home ten days later , when the inflammation had gone down			1
she said : ' i was cooking with lemon , making lemon and sultana scones for friends coming round and all of a sudden i could smell lemon			2
' i was on my own and just stood there and cried			0
' 1 ) ' @entity114 has to be the best one as that was the first thing i smelt and it was a tremendous feeling			0
grating that lemon and realising that i could smell it - i was beside myself			2
' 2 ) ' coffee has to be second because it 's just lovely			2
' 3 ) ' the spices that i use with my cooking			0
i love cumin , chilli , coriander , but all of them really			0
i love getting out my mortar and pestle and grinding seeds now			0
' 4 ) ' i 'm a member of @entity130 and i absolutely adore flowers , so it would be that			2
i wish it was rose season , but i just missed it this year			0
' 5 ) ' my husband 's garage at @entity138 , @entity139			0
it 's an @entity141 of parts of classic cars and our customers have often mentioned that they wish we could bottle how it smells , as it 's a very distinctive , old - fashioned smell of oil and engines that you do n't get at new garages			2
it reminds me of when we were first married and how @entity155 used to smell when he came home from work			0
' mrs @entity15 rang her husband @entity155 who runs a classic car business to tell him the news			1
he then asked if she had smelt anything else yet and told her to try smelling coffee			0
she was too afraid to try it at first , but when she opened a packet of @entity167 ground coffee and realised she could smell it , she admitted she was ' overwhelmed '			1
a few days more she finally had the courage to put on the perfume she had never smelt - the @entity172 brand intuition that she worn for years after it had been chosen for her by her two daughters			0
she said : ' i knew instantly what my daughters and husband meant when they said it smells of @entity178 , and i loved it			0
' regaining her sense of smell has also awakened strong emotions from the time before she developed chronic rhinosinusitis			1
mrs @entity15 who has two grandchildren said : ' my first baby boy did n't survive			1
he was full - term but he died and we had to come home from hospital without a baby			0
' you can imagine there are those smells that distinctly associated with a baby and i went straight into the nursery we had prepared and i could smell everything			0
' the smell of the wool , the newness of the clothes , particularly the @entity201 's baby powder and the soap			0
' you smell it and you never forget it			0
' i would torture myself and keep going in to the room , opening the wardrobe and holding the little vests and smelling them and the smells of a new baby			0
' mrs @entity15 was able to enjoy the same aromas when she and her husband had their first daughter @entity213			2
favourite smells : coffee and lemons are among the aromas mrs @entity15 missed most but she had completely lost her sense of smell by the time her second daughter @entity220 arrived so she is now eagerly awaiting the arrival of her third grandchild , due early next year .			1
