by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 8 february 2013 look away now if you do n't like creepy - crawlies : a new space celebrating the tiniest members of the animal kingdom has opened in @entity6			1
dubbed the @entity8 , the exhibition is at the @entity9 , part of @entity11			0
but take heart if you do n't like things with lots of legs : these really are tiny			2
the slides are cleaned in the @entity8 , an old office transformed into a beautiful backlit exhibition space the critters on display are among the tiniest in the natural world			2
although 95 per cent of known animal species are smaller than your thumb , most natural history museums tend to concentrate on their much bigger cousins - right up to the giant dinosaurs			2
to right this wrong , the @entity9 has converted an old office into a beautiful back - lit cave covered with wall - to - wall microscope slides			1
now is your chance to get up close and personal with a young cuttlefish a slice through an unfortunate tortoise mite is one of the thousands of specimens on display @entity9 manager @entity38 said : ' while public displays very much focus on larger animals , most natural history collections have thousands of very small specimens kept in their storerooms which are rarely shown to the public			1
the @entity9 is the only remaining university zoological museum in @entity6			1
it houses around 67,000 specimens - including those now on display in the @entity8			0
displayed in the former office are tiny creatures including elsewhere in the museum you can see @entity57 bones , a giant deer skull , an unusual batch of animal brains pickled in alcohol , and a jar full of preserved moles ' the huge majority of life on @entity66 is absolutely tiny , and we thought we 'd right that wrong			1
' he added that he is trying to give dragonfly nymphs , tortoise mites and sea spiders the attention they deserve the @entity9 , whose history stretches back to before the @entity76 era , has an eclectic group of items typical of 19th - century collections			1
it houses a giant deer skull , an unusual batch of animal brains pickled in alcohol , and an even eerier - looking jar jammed full of preserved moles			0
mr @entity38 said the back - lit walls of the @entity8 - housed in a former storage room within the larger museum - display 2,323 slides of mini-monsters , from tortoise beetles to baby cuttlefish			2
many of the slides were once used as study aids for @entity97 zoology and anatomy students and that some of them date back to the 1850s			0
he added that visitors who have trouble making out the ancient slides will be equipped with magnifying glasses			0
copepods are tiny crustaceans found in both the sea and nearly every freshwater habitat @entity38 , manager of the @entity111 museum , with the skull of one of the other residents - a @entity116 tiger founded in 1827 as a teaching collection , the museum is packed full of skeletons , mounted animals and specimens preserved in fluid			1
many of the species are now endangered or extinct including the @entity116 tiger or thylacine , the quagga and the dodo			0
the exhibition has just opened to the public - but do n't all come at once			0
the room is rather small .			0

more than 2,000 specimens crammed into a tiny former office
@entity138 *'s* history stretches back to the @entity76 era
