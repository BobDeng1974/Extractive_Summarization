rapid advances in modern technology mean every sleek new computer that hits the market is quickly usurped by a superior model , and servers are now typically replaced at least every four years			2
the social media giant wants students to help combat the mountain of discarded hardware by building a biodegradable server that can be flung on to the compost heap			1
@entity5 set up its @entity26 project with the aim of designing affordable , eco-friendly servers , and now it has thrown down the gauntlet to students at @entity31 in the @entity32 - a major research institution known for discoveries in technology and engineering - to come up with a design for a dissolvable server chassis			1
it is necessary to replace servers regularly in order to maintain a fast and reliable service			0
the housings are typically made from steel , which can be recycled , but the project aims to move toward an even more sustainable design made from entirely biodegradable materials , according to a report on businessinsider.com			1
if the project is a success it could see the creation of a computer server that will eventually break down entirely and decompose after it is discarded			2
@entity31 students will spend time studying relevant research before splitting into teams to work on their proposals			0
greener technology : @entity26 aims to design more eco-friendly servers they will then present their ideas to judges and the winning team will receive funding and further support to build a prototype			1
@entity26 said of the ambitious project : ' we think there 's enormous potential here , as servers are sometimes replaced as often as every two to three years			2
' and even though the steel in those server chassis is usually recycled , we think it 's worth exploring designs that retain the needed resiliency but push the boundaries of sustainability			0
' earlier this year an @entity81 firm unveiled an environmentally - friendly pc made almost entirely from wood			0
the makers of the iameco computer went to great lengths to ensure every possible part of the pc could be recycled			0
boasting a touch screen surrounded by a wooden frame , the team behind the award - winning model claim its carbon footprint is 70 per cent less than a conventional pc			0
award - winning design : the makers of the wooden iameco computer say its carbon footprint is 70 per cent smaller than that of a conventional pc			1

social media giant has challenged students at a top technology *university* in the @entity32 to come up with a design for a biodegradable server
project aims to *tackle* the *growing* problem of *electronic* waste by creating a server that can be thrown on the compost heap when it is replaced
students who come up with the winning design will receive funding and support to create a prototype
