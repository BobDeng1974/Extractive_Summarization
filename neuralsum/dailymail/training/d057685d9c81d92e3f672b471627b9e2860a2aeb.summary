clickety clack , clickety clack			2
it was the soundtrack to my @entity4 childhood , as my mother and grandmother knitted constantly			1
even relaxing in front of the tv , they were never happy unless their hands were occupied			2
it ’s a trait i inherited , and when my own children were small , i was never happier than when i was ‘ creating ’ something to swathe them in			1
but by their teenage years the time came when they did n’t want homemade clothes any more			1
i suppose wearing something knitted by @entity21 is n’t cool			1
@entity22 says she inherited her love of knitting from her mother and grandmother who knitted non-stop now @entity27 and @entity28 are 31 and 27 — and it would have taken me months to do anything for them			1
so , in the absence of grandchildren , i put away my knitting needles and took up needlepoint			1
then , a couple of months ago , i came across a colourful book of knitting patterns for dogs , by the designer and author @entity39			1
in the absence of grandchildren @entity22 has started knitting for her chihuahuas @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 and i just knew my three chihuahuas , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 ( yes , they are definite grandchild substitutes ) , would love something to keep them warm this winter			1
full of excitement , i dug out my yarns and knitting needles again			1
knitting is experiencing a renaissance here — with an estimated seven million knitters clacking away in their homes			1
and a huge number of knitters will own a dog			2
what ’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho ? asks @entity22 so what ’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho ? my two previous pets , @entity69 , miniature schnauzers , had the kind of coats of their own that could be clipped close in the summer and allowed to grow in the winter , so they never noticed the cold			1
chihuahuas , though , are different			1
mine are short - haired and , as soon as a winter nip sets in , they regard me as a lunatic when i enthusiastically shout : ‘ walkies ! ’ chihuahuas are bred for a @entity84 climate rather than the chilly @entity86 weather they hide behind the sofa and emerge reluctantly when i put on my bossy ‘ leader of the pack ’ voice			1
i then have to endure their pitiful display of shivering the minute we step out of the door			2
i ’ve even faced scathing comments from fellow dog walkers : ‘ poor little things			0
do n’t you think they should be wrapped up warm ? ’ my son , @entity27 , is a vet , and when i asked his opinion of the growing trend of clothes for dogs and whether i should get some for my three he was scornfully dismissive			0
‘ if a dog needs a coat it should n’t be living in this country			0
they ’re chihuahuas , for goodness sake , bred for the @entity84 climate			1
and they are dogs , @entity21			0
they should n’t be treated like pampered , spoilt babies			0
’ @entity22 has lavished love and affection on her pets since her sons @entity27 and @entity28 left home so my poor little chihuahuas just are n’t built for the chilly @entity86 winter			1
but they do make adorable companions			0
always welcoming , never making demands or expressing disapproval of @entity125 — the way children do			0
to be honest , i think @entity27 may be a teensy bit jealous of my canine kids , given the love and affection i ’ve lavished upon them since he and his brother flew the nest			1
@entity39 told me she was inspired to create a range of patterns for dog wear because every time she went to talk to her editor about knitting books they ended up talking about their dogs			2
combining her two greatest passions in life seemed like an inspired idea			0
her pets — @entity145 , the @entity147 @entity146 and @entity148 , the beagle — seemed happy in the sweaters , and @entity39 soon compiled enough doggy patterns for a book			2
it ’s illustrated with lots of fun photos of dogs in jumpers , including spaniels , bulldogs , collies and yorkies			2
the patterns vary in difficulty and can be modified for small , medium and large canines			0
the size of my three meant there was no point considering the @entity168 or the stripey sailor suit , because even the small would n’t have been small enough ( and i ’m not sure my skills are up to stripes just yet )			0
nor was i prepared to humiliate them by knitting the funny hats to go with their coats			2
my guys would have them off in seconds no matter how tight the elastic used to keep such hats in place			0
so in the end i went for the @entity182 ( a jumper with a rollneck to you and me )			0
i excitedly restocked my knitting bag with needles , a stitch holder , row counter , darning needle , tape measure and a strange contraption that helps you knit a rollneck in one piece without seams			2
i was surprised how quickly the skills came back			0
soon i was casting on like lightning , doing rib and stocking stitch and casting off neatly without any trouble			0
each jumper took the best part of three evenings — time that has turned out to be very well spent			0
@entity207 's brood - @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 in their homemade outfits @entity45 happily let me fit hers on and modelled it with her usual panache , prancing about like @entity213 on speed			1
i chose hot pink to suit her wild personality			0
@entity44 ( who has white fur ) looked very smart in black , and for @entity46 i picked a softer pink because i thought it would complement her grey coat			1
she did n’t seem to mind , though she looked a bit cross when she realised it was a bit too long at the back and wiggled from side to side when she wagged her tail — which she does a lot			0
i told her what my granny always said to me when she ’d stayed up all night to finish a sweater for me for school			0
‘ do n’t worry love , you ’ll grow into it			2
’ ( she wo n’t ! ) @entity22 thinks carefully about the tones that would suit each of her pet pooch 's natural fur colour this week , on a bit of a chilly day , i took all three to the local park			1
they ran about happily and were thrilled to be stopped every few minutes by fellow walkers saying : ‘ oh , do n’t they look gorgeous , where did you buy their lovely sweaters ? ’ i almost burst with pride when i answered : ‘ i did n’t , i made them myself			0
’ this substitute @entity255 is very , very happy indeed .			0
