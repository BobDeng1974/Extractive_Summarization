@entity0 believes the fifth - placed finish of @entity2 on his second career start at @entity4 should not be taken too negatively			1
the @entity5 and @entity6 are experiencing the ownership experience this summer with the chestnut colt trained by @entity9			0
hopes were high that our horse could step up on a promising debut sixth at @entity14 but , ill at ease on @entity4 ’s undulations , @entity2 could never reach a threatening position before running on when meeting the rising ground in the final furlong			1
@entity2 , who broke from the stalls slowly , was beaten by five lengths			2
@entity0 said : ‘ he did n’t like the ground , which has become very fast , or the track and he was taken off his feet in the early stages			0
‘ there are more positives than negatives to that run and , maybe , we should look to trying seven furlongs			0
’ dejected : @entity48 was hoping for better at today 's outing in @entity4 battle : @entity51 in action during the race in @entity4 on thursday support : @entity48 and @entity9 pictured alongside friends pre-race @entity2 , a son of sire @entity57 who was calmer in the preliminaries than he had been at @entity14 , was at the back of the field for much of the six - furlong race but did run through the line with some purpose , as it ended the race strongly			1
he is not be the first inexperienced horse to find the course at @entity4 tricky to handle but should hopefully learn from the experience			2
providing @entity2 emerges from the run in good shape , a third outing should not be too far away			1
after a third run , he will then become eligible to run contest nurseries - handicap races for two - year - olds .			0

@entity2 finished fifth in the 14:35 race at @entity4 on thursday
it was an *improvement* on their debut outing last month in @entity14 where they finished in a respectable sixth position
@entity48 *remains* confident for the *future* despite having higher hopes for the race at @entity4
