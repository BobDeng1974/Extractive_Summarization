by @entity0 a teenager has launched an app that could spell the end for the school run chaos			1
it allows users to search for their children 's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys			2
the app , called ecomumy , is available to download from @entity13 and @entity14 and is the brainchild of @entity16 , 17 , from @entity17 , south west @entity18			1
brains behind the brand : a new app called ecomumy is the brainchild of 17 - year - old @entity16 he said he came up with the idea after watching 4x4 cars with a seven - seater capacity carrying just three passengers during his slow journey to school			1
he said : ' when i travelled to school i would always notice there was a lot of congestion so i wondered if there was a way to resolve this issue and reduce traffic congestion as well as co2 emissions			1
' i would like all the schools in @entity41 to come forward on the idea of ecomumy so they can use it as a model and help the environment			2
' the app is described as : ' @entity49 parents to network with fellow mumys and to be part of a group of around 2 - 4 people to minimise the numbers of school rounds they do weekly , thereby freeing themselves for few full days in a week and reducing the traffic flow			1
' the mumys of a same school or even adjacent schools have the potential to network themselves and work together sharing the school rounds with other mumys of the same or adjacent schools			0
' the key part of the application is the schedule for small groups being created , which is known as the @entity69			0
' a mumy can either join with an already existing @entity69 or create a new @entity69 and wait for others to approach her and join hers			0
in each @entity69 an average of three mumys can join and work together sharing the school rounds			0
' clever : @entity16 came up with the ecomumy idea when he was just 15 @entity78 : the app allows users to search for their children 's school and co-ordinate with parents making similar journeys @entity16 , who is preparing for maths , physics , history and chemistry as - level exams at @entity90 , @entity91 , said he got into graphic design after designing the website of his father 's company			1
he said : ' my dad 's company bought an @entity100 kit and i wanted to try it out			0
one of his employees taught me when i was 10 and from there i started to self - teach			0
' so simple : @entity16 got into graphic design after designing the website of his father 's company and his new app is easy to use after coming up with the idea for ecomumy aged 15 , he made a story board , mapping out how the app would function , and sent it to developers in @entity113			2
he has also submitted it into the chest competition - a @entity117 - led initiative inviting innovators to propose solutions to key social challenges the ambitious teenager said his entry into the tech world is not yet the start of a career and he hopes to study engineering at university .			0

@entity129 helps parents arrange groups to organise the school run
developed by @entity16 , 17 , from south west @entity18
student hopes it will help reduce traffic and help environment
