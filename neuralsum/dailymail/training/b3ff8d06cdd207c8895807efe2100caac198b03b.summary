@entity7 was testing the powerful vehicle belonging to @entity9 for a magazine article when he accidentally over-revved the engine			1
he claimed that the veteran driver had agreed to cover the bill for the damage , but a high court judge ruled yesterday that mr @entity7 was responsible for the breakdown and ordered him to pay more than £ 100,000 in damages and costs			1
the writer has complained that the huge bill will bankrupt him - though it would hardly make a dent in the fortune of @entity25 's best - known motoring journalist @entity24 , who earns more than £ 1million a year thanks to his work on @entity27 and multiple books			1
lawsuit : journalist @entity7 , left , has been forced to pay out more than £ 100,000 after blowing up the engine of a vintage car belonging to racecar driver @entity9 , right damaged : this £ 1.3million replica of a @entity4 had its engine blow up after being over-revved by mr @entity7 mr @entity7 , 62 , who is himself an experienced race driver , borrowed mr @entity9 's @entity4 replica for a feature comparing it with a classic @entity36 owned by @entity38 drummer @entity37			1
he took the two cars to @entity40 in @entity41 in april 2009 in preparation for the article which was set to appear in @entity45 and @entity46 magazines			0
but as he was changing gear he revved the engine too much , causing it to break down entirely			0
mr @entity7 is adamant that he had a deal with mr @entity9 , 82 , who raced for the @entity51 in 1959 and 1960 , and that as a rule owners take care of mechanical problems while drivers pay for crashes			1
he said he had been having difficulties with the car , and claimed that as he changed from second to third gear it ' popped out ' , causing the engine to over-rev and blow up			2
experience : mr @entity7 was comparing the car to a @entity36 owned by @entity38 drummer @entity37 legend : mr @entity9 , now 82 , drove for @entity6 team @entity51 in 1959 and 1960 ' the @entity4 is a tough car to drive and it is a matter of fact that the engines blow up , ' he said			1
' everyone has done it and i knew this was the case			0
' i had a conversation with @entity9 and he asked me what happens if the engine blows up			1
i told him i could n't be responsible and he said ok , but then chose to forget the conversation			0
' if you crash the car you repair it but if it is mechanical you do n't			1
it was a gentleman 's agreement and i did n't write it down			0
i had a similar agreement with @entity37 for the @entity36 of his which i was driving			2
' mr @entity9 had the @entity4 repaired by a @entity83 specialist at a cost of £ 37,000 , before selling the replica race car last year for £ 1.3million			1

the car was powered by a five - litre engine , and could accelerate from 0 - 62mph in just 2.3 seconds			0
the 917 was brought to wider audience beyond petrol - heads after it appeared in the film @entity95 , released in 1971 starring @entity102			0
most of the film is taken up with footage of the 917 racing alongside other classic cars , showing off the model 's smart design and innovative mechanics			2
in his findings , judge @entity110 blamed mr @entity7 for failing to ' properly engage gear having been expressly told to do so and specifically warned about the risk of serious damage to the car if this was not done '			1
he added : ' his level of driving - on this particular occasion - fell below the standard of care , albeit high , required of him			0
' mr @entity9 's lawyers said their client was pleased at the decision and intended to recoup the £ 48,000 in damages and £ 63,000 of other costs which the court ordered mr @entity7 to pay			1
the journalist said : ' i 've sold everything to pay my lawyers and if he chooses to enforce the findings it is bankruptcy for me			2
' he added : ' it was clear he wanted his day in court and the judgement was an absolute disgrace			0
' this is n't what happens when you lend your race car to someone with no money but the judge did n't accept it			0
