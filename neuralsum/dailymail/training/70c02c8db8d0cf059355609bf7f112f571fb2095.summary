by @entity0 it seems some people will do anything for a freebie - and that includes blackmail			2
restaurant , hotel and @entity10 owners across the @entity11 have reported a huge rise in the number of customers who use @entity15 as a threat			1
chancers are telling staff they will post bad comments on the review site if they do n't get better service , meals or upgrades			2
bad reviews : guests are threatening hotel and restaurant owners for free meals and stays caterers say the scammers often make a complaint and say if they do n't get a free bottle of wine or dessert or a bill reduction they 'll post a bad review			1
other ' gastronomic blackmailers ' claim they even work for @entity15 and will post a series of negative comments unless they get free upgrades			1
@entity43 , deputy chief executive of the @entity44 , said he is in talks with @entity15 to improve the service			2
he said : ' people threatening restaurants and hotels with bad @entity15 reviews to extort free things is a problem which has been growing			1
' while it 's very difficult to put an exact figure on how widespread the problem is , it is clear that small minority of online reviewers are directly blackmailing - or sometimes subtly blackmailing - restaurants for their own gain			0
blackmailed : @entity61 and partner @entity62 outside their restaurant , @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity67 ' people will either attempt to blackmail during the meal , or sometimes , more worryingly , people who have not even been to the restaurant will post a bad review to try and get a free meal , or a free stay in a hotel 's case			1
' while it can be difficult to prove that somebody has blackmailed you , we would advise that business owners do not respond - or make free offers - to reviewers they suspect are malicious			2
' instead , take the matter to trip advisor , as they do work hard to keep malicious and inaccurate reviews off the site			0
and if you 're still having problems - get in touch with us			0
' steak house owner @entity61 , 49 , fears restaurateurs across the @entity11 are being hit by people who are jeopardising business reputations to get a free lunch			0
the @entity65 and @entity66 , in @entity67 , where customers have threatened the owners with bad reviews @entity61 claims around 30 meals out of the 1,000 he serves in his restaurant every week will be to malicious customers , who threaten bad reviews unless they get a freebie			1
@entity61 , who runs the @entity102 in @entity67 , @entity103 , with partner @entity62 , 33 , said : ' what usually happens is that a customer will come to the bar , or say to the waiting staff , " i am a senior @entity15 reviewer " and then you know that something will definitely go wrong			2
' under normal circumstances , when a customer is not happy , @entity61 would offer to knock money off the bill , give them a free bottle of wine , or a dessert			0
' but what we are finding is that these so called reviewers will complain about the meal or the service and when you ask how to put it right , you can guarantee it will be some sort of freebie , ' said @entity61			0
' but that 's all they 're after - something for free , and it just is n't right			0
' and it 's not just our restaurant that 's being affected , every restaurant owner i speak to is concerned about this phenomenon			0
' another concern for the couple is people posting malicious reviews on to the website without even going to the restaurant			1
@entity61 said : ' to begin with , when somebody posted a really bad review about us on @entity15 we would reply back to them , apologise and offer them a free meal or something			1
' but what we noticed was that some of the reviewers clearly had not even been to the restaurant and were just posting the review to blag a free meal out of us			1
' one such reviewer went on about how the tables in the restaurant were really old on the week we had just had them replaced			0
' @entity15 is essential to business owners because it 's probably the first place people check to see if a restaurant 's good or not			1
' but these malicious customers know that - and they realise they can use it to their advantage			0
' a spokesman for @entity15 said : ' allegations of blackmail or threatening behaviour by guests against property owners are taken very seriously			1
' if an owner experiences this , we urge them to contact us immediately			0
we have a way for owners to proactively report threats before a corresponding review is submitted			0
' immediate reporting of blackmail threats , via our @entity183 , which every owner can register on for free , can help us keep blackmail reviews from ever reaching the site			2

*tourism* bosses targeted by *fraudsters* demanding free meals and stays
some scammers have not even visited the restaurant or hotel before posting bad reviews in an attempt to get *compensatory* freebies
@entity15 says they are taking allegations of blackmail very seriously
