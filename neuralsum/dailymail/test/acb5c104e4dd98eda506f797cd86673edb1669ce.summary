@entity0 has called for @entity2 ’s @entity1 to be spared a @entity4 ban despite his controversial handball			1
the @entity7 boss admitted the 2 - 1 @entity9 victory at @entity10 had helped him bounce back from what he described as the toughest day of his career at @entity13 on sunday			1
but although his club ’s treble ambitions were shattered as a result of the @entity19 ’ incident in the semi-final defeat to @entity2 , the @entity14 said it would serve no purpose for the defender to be given a retrospective suspension by the @entity24			1
@entity2 defender @entity1 ' arm blocks the ball and prevents a goal to @entity7 on sunday @entity1 has been retrospectively suspended for one match , the punishment he would have got if sent off the fall - out from the @entity13 showdown has been dominated by the failure of the match officials to award a penalty after @entity1 blocked a goal - bound effort from @entity37 with his hand			1
@entity2 will learn today whether they have succeeded in overturning the suspension that compliance officer @entity40 offered earlier this week			1
and while @entity7 have written to the @entity24 seeking clarity over the pivotal incident , @entity0 insisted that he hopes @entity1 is cleared to line up against @entity43 in the final on may 30			1
‘ it does not help our situation at all and i do not think that he did it on purpose , ’ said the @entity46 manager			2
‘ it all happened so quickly and it is a clear handball and a red card and a penalty			1
‘ i do n’t think that is right for him to miss that match as you want all the best players to play in the final			1
i would hope that the ban would be overturned			1
’ @entity0 said he was unaware of any response from @entity13 to @entity7 ’s letter but said he can understand the scale of the furore that has erupted this week			1
@entity68 vice president @entity67 yesterday waded in to the debate to strongly criticise the @entity24 ’s decision to charge @entity1			1
‘ it is a huge thing as we are talking about the @entity73 here and the @entity75 semi-final when we were 1 - 0 up , ’ added @entity0			1
@entity68 's head of referees @entity67 says the suspension of a player for an unpunished handball is wrong @entity2 is appealing the ruling that , if upheld , will deny @entity1 ( right ) a place in the @entity4 final ‘ i am trying to focus on the next game and we have performed very well since @entity85 and we have racked up a lot of wins and points			1
’ @entity0 admitted he had hit an all - time low after the 3 - 2 extra-time defeat to @entity91 ’ side last sunday			1
but he had his spirits restored at @entity93 last night as goals from @entity95 and @entity96 secured victory over @entity10 , who struck a late consolation through @entity100			2
the result pushed @entity7 closer to the @entity9 title as they hold an eight - point lead over @entity104 with just five games to go			1
‘ it was the toughest day of my career on sunday , ’ reflected @entity0			2
‘ i have to admit that			0
@entity1 ( right ) celebrates @entity2 's 3 - 2 win over @entity7 in their @entity4 semi-final ‘ we really wanted it and we had a very good opportunity there			1
so sunday and monday was very tough			0
but now it has gone			0
‘ i just want to keep winning games and to get that league title to @entity119			0
then we have had a good season			0
‘ i ’m proud of the boys tonight			0
i told the players that they should be very disappointed but winners bounce back			0
‘ there is nothing in football for feeling sorry for yourself			0
whoever wins the league is the best team			0
if you win a title you deserve it as you ’ve done it over 38 games			2
in a cup it ’s just one game			0
so the league is always the most important thing			0
‘ what did i do on monday ? i just stayed at home and i looked at the wall ! i watched a bit of tv as well , ’ added @entity0 , who has been linked with a potential move for @entity138 under - 21 central defender @entity137			2
meanwhile , @entity10 boss @entity145 continued the recent referee - related theme by admitting he had been irked by some of @entity150 ’s calls last night			2
‘ there were a couple of decisions that we were n’t happy with , ’ said @entity145 , who saw @entity151 score what proved a consolation goal in the 87th minute			0
‘ some of the decisions were quite bizarre			0
‘ we understand that they have a tough job in high - pressure games			2
we had one in the first half and the referee gave offside and the linesman did n’t			0
he made a mistake and he admitted that to me at half - time			2
‘ overall , i thought we were good			0
we just lacked a little cutting edge			0
if we had scored the goal 10 or 15 minutes previously we would have had them worried			0
‘ two set - pieces have done us in			2
i thought we worked well , we were well organised and there was good discipline to our performance			0
@entity7 have quality throughout their team			1

@entity1 was given a retrospective one - match ban for a handball
the incident was *n't* punished in @entity2 's @entity4 win over @entity7
the ban , which is being appealed , would rule @entity1 out of the @entity4 final
