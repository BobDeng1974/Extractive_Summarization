a @entity2 mp is on the verge of defecting to @entity4 , @entity0 claimed today			1
the former @entity6 mp who easily won the @entity7 by - election after switching parties said it was ' looking very promising ' that a @entity2 mp would be next to join him			1
labour leader @entity11 today sought to rescue his crisis - hit leadership with a fresh promise of an immigration crackdown , after @entity4 also came within 617 votes of winning the safe @entity2 seat of @entity17 and @entity18 on thursday night			1
attention had been focused on @entity6 mps and their willingness to change parties , fearing a @entity4 surge in their constituencies would cost them their seat in @entity37			1
however , the @entity17 result and growing unease about mr @entity11 's leadership mean @entity4 leader @entity41 now has his sights set on wooing @entity31 to cross the floor			1
mr @entity44 revealed that within hours of his @entity7 by - election triumph , he took a call from a @entity2 mp poised to jump			1
speaking on friday , he said : ' a member of the @entity48 called me this morning and we had a chat about them coming over			2
' it 's looking very promising , ' he told @entity54			0
' for years and years and years , like monopolistic businesses , they assumed the customers had nowhere else to go			0
@entity11 has been urged to copy @entity58 by having people with broader appeal around him , such as @entity61 and @entity62 @entity11 must get out of his ' north @entity65 comfort zone ' or he will not win the election , @entity2 mp @entity63 warned today			1
he urged the @entity2 leader to appoint a wide slate of mps to his frontbench , in the way that @entity58 put up with @entity61 and @entity62 because they broadened @entity2 's appeal			1
mr @entity63 said mr @entity11 ’s article would not persuade a sceptical country he was taking action to deal with immigration			2
@entity2 mp @entity63 he told @entity78 : ' we need to see demonstrable evidence of a change of attitude			1
' he has to move outside his north @entity65 comfort zone			1
@entity58 had @entity61 , who he clearly could n’t stand , and @entity62 , who is not a natural dining partner , as his key lieutenants			0
' @entity58 ’s was n’t particularly comfortable with either @entity61 or @entity62 but he understood that represented areas of the electorate that he did n’t feel comfortable with			0
‘ @entity11 is n’t doing it , that ’s @entity11 ’s problem			2
‘ if he does n’t succeed in getting outside his comfort zone , he will not be prime minister			1
' ' then @entity4 came along			2
for years and years they assumed that their own party had nowhere else to go			0
well , guess what , guys , they do			0
' today he told @entity96 's @entity95 he hoped there would be more @entity6 mps joining @entity4			2
but he stressed : ' @entity4 is not the conservative party in exile			2
i try to work with mps from all parties			2
i am primarily interested in making sure voters make the journey i have made			0
' he refused to confirm or deny that veteran @entity2 mp @entity107 was poised to defect			1
' @entity107 has been saying that for many years and on that i think he 's proved ahead of his time , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' i try and work with mps of all parties but i 'm primarily interested in trying to make sure that voters make the journey that i have made			0
' this is n't about which 650 politicians make their journey			0
' he likened the @entity6 party to struggling music shop @entity119 , with @entity4 acting like the online music - streaming service @entity122			2
' i think it ’s a little bit like @entity119 music , once ubiquitous when it came to buying music			0
' the way the @entity6 is retailing politics is like the way @entity119 retailed music : it ’s a defunct retail model			0
' i argued that we needed to @entity122 politics , we ought to make the @entity6 a bit more like @entity122 , but the @entity6 ca n’t change and wo n’t change because there are too many vested interests that are against recall , against open primary , against direct democracy , against change			0
' why ? because if we had direct democracy many members of the @entity6 and the leadership would be replaced			0
' in an attempt to shore up his troubled leadership , mr @entity11 today pledged tougher measures for migrants coming to @entity144 saying they will have to be able to speak @entity145 and must earn the right to claim benefits			1
the @entity2 leader announced the policy just days after the party only narrowly won last week 's @entity151 by - election in the former @entity2 stronghold , where it hung on with a wafer - thin majority over @entity4			1
mr @entity11 has been accused by some party members of not doing enough to combat the threat of @entity4 with @entity158 , the former mp for @entity159 , saying the party 's dismal performance ' was not the performance of a government - in - waiting '			1
but today writing in the @entity164 , mr @entity11 says he recognises that @entity4 is a threat that the @entity22 can not ignore as immigration has ' changed the face of many communitites			1
' he then went on to explain the new immigration measures were an attempt to tackle the issue in a ' hard - headed fashion '			0
the paper reports that sources say the new measures would include extending the period that @entity178 migrants must wait before they can claim unemployment benefits to six months and imposing language tests on those applying for certain public sector jobs			2
mr @entity11 wrote : ' our task is to turn the despair and cynicism on which @entity4 thrives into a positive force for change			1
we can only do so if we understand that many people are turning to @entity4 because of disappointment with @entity6 and @entity2 governments			1
' i will not cede the issue of immigration to those offering fear or falsehood			0
so i will continue to chart a new way forward , combining stronger border controls and laws to stop the exploitation that has undermined wages of local workers , with reforms to ensure those who come here speak @entity145 and earn the right to any benefit entitlements			0
' such measures are part of a compelling and credible plan for @entity144 's future that will restore the values people believe in – contribution , responsibility , fairness – to the way our country is run			0
' @entity4 have risen dramatically in the polls since april 2012 when they languished on 9 % with little hope of an mp the pledges come after concerns @entity41 and @entity4 are gaining massive support in traditional @entity2 heartlands			1
@entity2 deputy leader @entity227 today insisted there was no ' wobble ' in the @entity2 ranks and denied a leadership change would be required despite concerns about how voters view the party and huge @entity4 gains in @entity17 and @entity18			1
she told @entity96 's @entity95 : ' there 's not a wobble in the ranks and nor should there be			0
' obviously we 're very pleased we 've got a new @entity2 mp and it was evident there was a collapse in confidence in the @entity244 and the @entity245 but that does n't make us complacent because the result was very close			1
' but i think what is absolutely evident is that the anger and concern that there is amongst people when they 're being told the recovery has arrived and yet they 're not getting better off , and feeling disconnected from politics , that is being picked up on by @entity4 but actually @entity4 , although they 're tapping into that sense of despair , they do n't provide the answers			2
' asked if there was any chance that @entity2 would change its leader before the general election , ms @entity227 said : ' no , absolutely not			1
we always knew and @entity11 knew , the whole party knew it would be a very tough challenge after we were defeated in 2010 to be in contention to be in government and to have a @entity2 prime minister in 2015			1
' she added : ' we are not going to have a wobble or a leadership change			0
' @entity2 mp @entity275 says mr @entity11 's team have now idea how to combat @entity41 's , pictured , ' street fighting ' political skill one northern @entity2 mp , speaking on condition of anonymity , told the @entity283 : ' if @entity11 cared to ask me , i could tell him why @entity4 is picking up votes in northern constituencies			1
it is because if a single mother with a child is in a queue for council housing , she will find that an @entity293 family with three children can jump ahead of her			0
' and if she goes to the local @entity296 , the same @entity293 families will have taken all the appointments			0
anyone who utters that kind of sentiment is denounced as a racist			0
it is nothing of the sort : it is the truth			0
' meanwhile another mp , @entity275 , said @entity2 could lose the @entity304 because mr @entity11 's team had no idea how to combat @entity41 's ' street - fighting ' political skill			1
mr @entity275 , who took part in the @entity17 campaign , said he was shocked by the hostility to @entity2 on the doorstep			2
' we came extremely close to losing the seat , ' he said			0
' the ministerial bag - carriers who now run the @entity22 have no idea how to manage the bare - knuckle street - fighting which is @entity41 's speciality			0
' the seat nearly fell – and the @entity304 could be lost for the same reason – because we are not tackling people 's feeling of unfairness over immigration and the effect it is having on schools , housing and hospitals			0
' the team around @entity11 have this aversion to even discussing immigration because they are so ideologically wedded to the @entity178 and its open borders policy			2

@entity11 warned he must ' get out of north @entity65 comfort zone ' or lose
pressure mounts on @entity11 after holding safe seat by just 617 votes
