many zoolander fans were overjoyed when the pair stepped out to close the @entity3 runway show earlier this month , in the guise of their iconic characters @entity20 and @entity20			1
but now the comedic duo have taken the unlikely collaboration off the runway in order to pose up for a quirky print campaign , which is believed to have been shot around the same time as the catwalk show			2
