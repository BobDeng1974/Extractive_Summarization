@entity2 chancellor @entity1 will arrive in @entity8 tomorrow morning for talks with @entity0 which are likely to focus on his demands for @entity4 reform mr @entity0 has promised that if he is still @entity6 after may 's general election he will renegotiate @entity3 's membership of the @entity4 before staging an in - out referendum before the end of 2017			1
he has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed , and he will then recommend staying in the @entity4			2
if he fails he admits he will ' rule nothing out ' , raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28 - nation bloc			1
however , mrs @entity1 has insisted that she will not support any moves to alter the fundamental principle of freedom of movement			0
she wants @entity3 to remain in the @entity4 , but senior figures in @entity43 have repeatedly said they will not seek to do so at any cost			0
the @entity2 chancellor will arrive in the @entity3 tomorrow morning and they visit the @entity15 to see an exhibition on the history of her country			1
the museum 's @entity2 : @entity52 exhibition traces 600 years of the history , with exhibits including works of art and a @entity57			1

the @entity2 : @entity52 exhibition traces 600 years of the history , with exhibits including works of art and a @entity57 he used a major in november to set out key demands on banning @entity4 nationals from claiming in - work benefits or social housing in @entity3 for four years , deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity4 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity3 levels			1

@entity3 taxpayers will not support them if they do n't			0
' however , today there were reports that the @entity97 was preparing to block the move			0
the @entity99 said the commission is preparing to let @entity101 know that the proposal would be unworkable because it would be impossible to distinguish between @entity4 jobseekers and tourists entering the @entity3			0
ahead of the visit , @entity106 leader @entity105 said : ' @entity2 is facing its own problems at the moment and would not want @entity3 to start turning away @entity4 jobseekers , potentially redirecting them to seek work there			0

@entity0 says he thinks renegotiation will succeed and will vote to stay in
