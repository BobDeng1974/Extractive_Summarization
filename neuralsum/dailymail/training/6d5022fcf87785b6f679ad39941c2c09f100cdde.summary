@entity0 has been in such impressive form this season that @entity3 found it fitting to name him twice in the starting line - up - at the expense of @entity7			1
the comical error was spotted while the television channel was going through @entity3 's starting line - up ahead of their game with @entity12			2
the @entity14 international was pictured in both full back positions and even by his standards - it would be difficult to play both at the same time			0
@entity0 was named in both full back positions in @entity3 's starting line up against @entity12 @entity7 , whose been one of the league leaders most consistent performers , will certainly disagree with their choice of starting line up			2
@entity26 is unlikely to name the same line up as @entity3 's but he has given new signing @entity29 is first start			0
@entity31 also got the nod ahead of @entity33 as he looks to continue his fine record of scoring three goals in just seven shots			0
@entity0 ( right ) in the warm up ahead of @entity3 's game against @entity12 at @entity39 @entity7 ( left ) will disagree with @entity3 's take on the starting line up against the @entity12			1

@entity3 made the mistake during the build up to the game with @entity12
@entity0 named twice in the starting line up
@entity7 was the *unlucky* player to be left out the team
