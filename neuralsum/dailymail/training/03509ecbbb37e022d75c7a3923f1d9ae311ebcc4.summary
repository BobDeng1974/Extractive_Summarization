it 's a sticky issue that has plagued scientists – and breakfast tables – for decades			2
but now researchers claim to have found the definitive answer as to why a piece of toast always seems to fall buttered side down			1
apparently , it ’s all to do with the height of the table			2
they claim that after it topples off the edge , the toast only has time to perform a half - somersault before it lands			1
scientists say toast falls butter side down because it only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing as the side which has been buttered is naturally facing upwards , that ’s the side which ends up on the floor			1
to confirm the theory , food expert professor @entity23 and his team dropped 100 slices of toast from a table at @entity29			1
the table was two and a half feet high			2
in 81 per cent of cases , the buttered side made contact with the floor			1
the research was commissioned to mark the @entity36 release of the latest series of @entity38 , a @entity40 comedy about a group of socially awkward physicists			0
‘ the question of whether the toast does indeed always land buttered side down is exactly the kind of quandary that would keep the characters in @entity38 awake at night , ’ said professor @entity23			1
‘ our research shows that @entity52 really does exist when it comes to dropped toast			2
researchers from @entity29 dropped 100 slices of buttered toast to test their theory ‘ the upshot is that if you want to ensure your toast lands butter side up then you should invest in a higher table approximately 8ft high that allows the toast to rotate a full 360 degrees			1
failing that – try not to drop the toast			0
’ while the crucial element is the height of the table , which affects the time the toast takes to fall , the physics of the slice of toast itself also have an effect			1
the air pockets in a slice of bread create drag as it falls			0
but buttering one side of the bread changes that surface , altering the level of drag and changing the way it rotates as it falls			0
the phenomenon has baffled scientists and the public alike for almost 180 years			0
it was discussed as long ago as 1835 , in the @entity86			0
of course , the problem only occurs if you can spread the butter in the first place			0
a recent survey of 3,000 people found their biggest breakfast bugbear was ruining a slice of toast by trying to spread butter that was too cold			0
but designers came up with a solution – a heated knife to warm the butter , which baker @entity101 hopes to produce .			0

scientists said toast only has time to rotate half a somersault before landing
buttered side faces upwards , *meaning* that side ends up on the floor
researchers from @entity29 dropped 100 slices from table
