plants are slowing the effects of climate change far more than expected , researchers have found			2
they said the impact of rising @entity6 levels on plant growth has been underestimated by 16 per cent , as they thrive with more of the gas in the atmosphere			1
and as plants absorb @entity6 , this has led to overestimates of how much of the greenhouse gas is left in the atmosphere			1
researchers say the impact of rising @entity6 levels on plant growth has been underestimated by 16 per cent			1
in a separate study , reported in the same journal , scientists artificially elevated @entity6 levels in a @entity22 prairie grasslands ecosystem for eight years			1
they found that the added carbon had increased the overall volume of the plants and promoted the ecosystem 's stability by reducing the growth of normally dominant plant species			1
the study was conducted by climate and earth scientists at the @entity33 and @entity34 in @entity35			0
it says a 16 per cent ' correction ' would be ' large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric co2 by earth system models '			1
' our study will lead to improved understanding and modelling of carbon – climate feedbacks , ' the paper says			0
@entity49 , from the @entity50 at @entity34 in the @entity22 , said most carbon - cycle models had over-predicted the growth rate			2
dr @entity49 said the growth rate of carbon levels had been over-predicted by 17 per cent over a 100 - year period			1
the study in the @entity57 focusses on the slow diffusion of co2 in plant leaves , with particular attention to the mesophyll or their inner tissue			2
it concludes : ' carbon cycle models that lack explicit understanding of mesophyll diffusion will underestimate historical and future terrestrial carbon uptake			0
' consequently , they will overestimate historical and future growth rates of atmospheric co2 concentration due to fossil fuel emissions , with ramifications for predicted climate change			0
' professor @entity76 , @entity77 at the @entity78 , said even if the study was correct , the effect will be ' relatively small ' compared to uncertainties about how much carbon will be absorbed by plants and soil			0
researchers said the growth rate of carbon levels had been over-predicted by 17 per cent over a 100 - year period			1
he said : ' avoiding 2c of global warming is a huge challenge for humanity even if this effect is taken into account			0
' prof @entity95 , @entity96 at the @entity97 and chair in @entity99 at the @entity78 , said : ' this is a very interesting paper adding to our understanding of plant physiology			0
' the authors remark on the potential importance of their results for global carbon cycle modelling , and this is indeed relevant , but as a priority for improving carbon cycle modelling there are other processes which current models treat either very simplistically or not at all			0
' fire disturbance , for example , is not included in some of the models examined here – its inclusion could be more important than any improvements in modelling @entity6 fertilization , as it seems likely to be an important feedback on climate change			2
' changes in global soil respiration at the global scale are also poorly understood			0
' so while this is an interesting and useful contribution , it should be put into context with the bigger picture – disturbance mechanisms as well as physiological processes are important			0
