published : 11:06 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 03:18 est , 21 january 2014 tragic : @entity1 was left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash in march 2009 the sisters of a woman left severely brain damaged after she was injured in a car crash have published a study calling for patients in a vegetative state to be allowed to die			1
@entity11 and @entity12 were devastated when their sister @entity13 was involved in the crash in march 2009			1
five years on @entity13 , now 52 , has emerged from a coma but remains with permanent and profound mental and physical disabilities			1
although the sisters handed doctors a 100 - page dossier outlining fiercly independent mental health advocate @entity13 's wishes not to be kept alive , including her own notes and testimonies from family and friends , they were legally unable to have her treatment stopped			1
now @entity11 and @entity12 , who are both university professors , have published research declaring that other families of severely brain damaged patients believe that when all other avenues have been exhausted , terminal sedation is a humane option			1
@entity12 , a professor in the @entity36 at @entity37 and @entity11 , sociology professor at the @entity38 , hope their research , published in the respected @entity41 , will help inform debate about ways of dying when people become catastrophically disabled through illness or injury			1
' often family members want to speak publicly about this but it ’s taboo for them to say they wished their loved one was dead or would want to be dead , ' @entity12 said			0
' @entity13 , who very much believed in people being able to make their own health choices , had a car crash and now lives life in a coma			2
' it is a very , very cruel irony			0
' she ’s trapped and could live like this for another 25 years			0
i know it ’s not what she would want			0
' trapped : @entity13 's sisters have said she is ' trapped ' due to her severe mental and physical disabilities , and believe she should be allowed to die prior to the accident , @entity13 , now 52 , was a mental health user involvement officer at @entity65 and was returning from a work conference when she was involved in the car crash near @entity68 , @entity69			1
having suffered multiple fractures and profound brain injury , she was kept breathing on a ventilator as she was rushed to the @entity74 in @entity75			1
soon afterwards , the family was told the prognosis was grim and although @entity13 now has some minimal consciousness having emerged from her coma , she has permanent mental and physical disabilities and will always need round - the - clock care			1
her sisters , daughters of acclaimed birth rights writer and campaigner dr @entity85 , talked about dying before the accident and say they have no doubt their younger sister , who lived in @entity68 , would not want to be kept alive			2
research : @entity12 , pictured , and her sister have completed research showing some families would consider terminal sedation for brain injured relatives in a permanent vegetative state ' we ’d discussed as a family what we ’d each want if we lost capacity to make decisions and mother and i had written living wills , ' said @entity12 , who is in her			1
' you can download forms on informed consent and living wills			0
when i cleared @entity13 ’s house in @entity68 i found an empty form from @entity113 , she ’d never filled it in			2
how many of us find time to do it ? ' ' it feels very cruel for @entity13 that she is kept alive against her wishes			1
' after her accident we discovered next of kin have no legal right to take decisions			0
” @entity12 , who lives in @entity122 , said @entity13 was a lively , fearless woman who enjoyed sailing and gardening and had strong views on patient rights and disability rights			2
she hopes the study , withdrawing @entity129 from @entity130 and @entity131 : family perspectives research , will help raise awareness of the issue			0
speaking to 51 relatives of patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state , the sisters found two thirds believed their relative would rather be dead than stay alive in that condition , but less would consider applying to halt artificial feeding and hydration to allow death			0
some told them euthanasia by sedation was preferable to withholding or withdrawing treatment			2
currently , halting treatment is the only legal method guaranteed to allow death in patients in a vegetative state			0
' at the moment it is legal to allow people to die by withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration , but that can mean watching a long , slow death which many relatives just can not bear the thought of , ' explained @entity11			0
' there must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die			0
' @entity166 ' if a court is going to take a decision to allow someone to die , why not do it in a way that ’s less prolonged for the patient ? ' there must be a more merciful way of allowing people to die			0
' the lived reality of the families facing these decisions should be taken into account and other ways of bringing about the death of severely brain damaged patients should be given full ethical consideration			1
” the sisters , who are co-directors of the @entity185 ( @entity186 ) which explores the social and ethical challenges of the vegetative and minimally conscious state , say relatives ’ views should be given ethical consideration in legal and medical debates on treatment options			0
their work has also informed a leaflet for families to help them represent their loved one and @entity12 organised a before i die festival in @entity75 last may to encourage people to discuss their end - of - life wishes			1
the @entity75 academic also spoke at the launch of the new @entity206 national clinical guidelines on ' @entity208 ' last month			0
' we are trying to honour @entity13 ’s values and beliefs in the ways that we can , ' said @entity12			2
' i hope our research means that @entity13 ’s legacy lives on			2

@entity1 suffered profound brain injury in crash near @entity68 in 2009
she was left with severe disabilities and needs round - the - clock care
doctors told @entity11 and @entity12 they were unable to stop treatment
@entity11 and @entity12 say it is ' cruel ' that @entity13 is kept alive against her wishes
@entity38 professors have published research from other families of brain damaged patients who believe terminal sedation is a humane option
