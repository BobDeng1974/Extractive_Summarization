by @entity0 the fragile @entity2 truce over @entity3 disintegrated last night after it emerged that more than 100 conservative mps and candidates are set to defy @entity6 at the @entity7 next year by vowing to leave the @entity8			1
the prime minister has promised the @entity2 manifesto will spell out his pledge for a referendum by 2017 on @entity14 ’s links with @entity3 after trying to win back key powers from @entity16			2
but @entity2 rebels will go further and make their own personal manifesto vows to campaign to withdraw from the @entity8 – regardless of any concessions by @entity16			2
@entity6 faces the threat of at least 100 of his own mps vowing to leave the @entity8 after the next election			1
@entity24 mp @entity23 ( right ) says @entity14 should leave whatever deal is struck with the @entity8 it is a major rebuff for mr @entity6 , who hoped his referendum commitment would stop open warfare over @entity3 during the campaign			1
the rebels were to declare their provocative plan after may ’s @entity33 elections , when they are expected to lose seats to @entity35 , but the move was leaked to @entity37			0
the rebels say mr @entity6 should not accuse them of disloyalty because when he first stood for @entity33 in 1997 , then prime minister @entity39 begged @entity2 candidates to back his pledge not to have his hands tied on whether @entity14 should join the proposed euro , which was launched in 1999			0
mr @entity6 was among many who refused , pledging to rule out joining the single @entity2 mp @entity23 said last night he would vow to vote to quit the @entity8 – and ignore mr @entity6 ’s plan to renegotiate membership			1
rebel mps say their stand is similar to mr @entity6 's own stance on @entity39 's demands on the euro in 1999 mr @entity23 , currently conducting his own @entity8 referendum in his @entity24 constituency , said : ‘ there is no prospect of being able to remake the @entity8 in a way that is acceptable to @entity14			1
we are going to have an in / out referendum by 2017 and i will vote to come out			0
’ another @entity45 mp , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ we will loyally refer to mr @entity6 ’s hopes of a new settlement with @entity16 in our manifestos , but the message will be clear – vote for us and we will vote to get our sovereignty back and go it alone without the dead hand of @entity16			0
’ a third @entity2 said : ‘ when it suited mr @entity6 to make a firm statement against the euro in his 1997 manifesto ... he went ahead and did it			0
he would not be so ill - judged to try to stop us , as it would leave him vulnerable to the charge of hypocrisy			0
