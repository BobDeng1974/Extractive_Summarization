@entity1 subsidies added to families ’ energy bills are to rise nearly four-fold by 2030 , according to a report published today			2
state funding for wind and solar power and a carbon tax on coal and gas will together add £ 175 to the average household bill by 2030 , according to the government ’s climate advisors			2
that is nearly four times the £ 45 added to bills last year , the @entity14 said			0
the cost of energy to business and industry is set to double in the same period , with the price of goods and services bound to increase as a result			1
the report is published as politicians from 196 countries meet in @entity28 to try to agree a treaty to curb climate change			2

file picture energy secretary @entity36 , who arrived at the @entity38 summit in @entity39 yesterday , is among those trying to push for every nation to adopt strict targets on carbon emissions to restrict global warming to @entity45			2
@entity46 has already adopted the most stringent climate law in the world – a legal obligation to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 per cent by 2050			1
but mr @entity36 wants other nations to follow suit , to adopt rules that will force them to reduce emissions			0
the impact of such policies is laid bare in the @entity14 report today			0
in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in line with its strict targets , the @entity46 government has agreed to plough money into solar farms , wind turbines and nuclear power – with the cost added to consumer bills			1
the government also has several measures in place designed to deter companies from emitting greenhouse gases , which in turn create a ‘ carbon price ’ that is added to the cost of power generated by gas , coal and oil			2
in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , the @entity46 government has agreed to plough money into solar farms , wind turbines and nuclear power – with the cost added to consumer bills the committee estimates that these measures together made up £ 45 of the average £ 1,140 dual gas and electricity bill in 2013			1
the green components will more than double to £ 100 by 2020 , and soar to £ 175 by 2030 , by which time the total average bill will be £ 1,305			0
the committee also identified £ 70 added to bills to support energy efficiency measures such as new boilers in low income homes and for wall and loft insulation			0
this element will of bills will decrease to £ 60 in 2020 and £ 40 in 2030			0
the committee said that funding for green power helped cut as much emissions as taking 10 million cars off the road			0
most of the rises in household bills , which have increased almost £ 500 on average since 2004 , are due to rising wholesale gas prices and investment in electricity and gas networks , it said			0
the cost to business will also rise , with the green element of energy bills set to double to 31 per cent for the commercial sector and 26 per cent for the industrial sector			1
consumers will undoubtedly be effected by this , with the cost due to drive up the price of food , clothes and services			1

file picture the report said : ‘ meeting the @entity46 ’s statutory carbon targets will add to energy bills in the future , though with potential to offset much of this through energy efficiency			1
‘ electricity generation will need to shift from fossil fuels to low - carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear , which are currently more expensive			0
’ @entity14 chairman @entity149 added : ‘ last year , as energy consumers we all helped hundreds of thousands of poorer people to have warmer homes and contributed to real reductions in our emissions in the fight against climate change			1
‘ many people saved more than that by taking simple energy saving measures that did n't interfere with their life - style			1
’ dr @entity162 , director of @entity163 , a @entity46 charity critical of the costs of policies to consumers said : ‘ consumers should be aware that low carbon policies do not just affect their energy bills , but also increase the cost of living as industrial and commercial consumers pass on their costs in the price of goods and services			1
‘ the @entity14 ’s study shows , in the fine print , that this effect will range from £ 210 to £ 360 a year 2020 , depending on the cost of fossil fuels , and between £ 345 and £ 705 a year in 2030			1
’ the government has repeatedly insisted that imposing green levies and taxes will save consumers money in the long - run , because energy efficiency measures will mean that total bills are cheaper than they otherwise would have been			1
however , ministers were forced to drastically downgrade their estimates of the potential saving last month			0
previously they had estimated that the average bill would be £ 166 cheaper in 2020 than if no green policies had been adopted – but as the @entity196 revealed in november , the government ’s own calculations have reduced that potential saving by 45 per cent to £ 92			0
a spokesman for the @entity199 said : ‘ thanks to @entity195 policies , bills are an estimated £ 90 lower this year and will be even lower by 2020			0
‘ our policies are designed to keep the lights on , reduce polluting emissions , cut energy use at the lowest possible cost to gas and electricity customers			2

the cost of energy to business and industry is set to double in the same period , causing a *knock* - on effect to other goods and services
