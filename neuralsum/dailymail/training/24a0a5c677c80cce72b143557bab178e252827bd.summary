jailed publicist @entity0 is being sued by former royal butler @entity1 over claims that he secretly faxed a confidential letter to a newspaper containing private information about the @entity6			1

@entity1 went to @entity0 for help in 2001 when he was at the centre of a media storm after being accused of stealing hundreds of princess @entity19 ’s possessions			1
former royal butler @entity1 , above with the @entity19 , is suing disgraced publicist @entity0 at @entity0 ’s request , he wrote a six - page letter setting out his relationship with the @entity6 and the @entity24 , including details of personal gifts he had received from the @entity27 and the @entity6 ’s interest in the birth of his first son			1
later , on legal advice , @entity1 decided not to use @entity0 ’s services			2
but an angry @entity0 faxed the letter to @entity35 , then editor of the now defunct @entity37 , it is claimed			1
the @entity38 did not publish its details			0
along with information about @entity1 ’s relationship with the @entity27 , the letter also detailed ‘ a serious accident ’ he suffered while in the @entity44 with the @entity6 and the medical treatment she arranged for him			0
the @entity8 writ was served on @entity0 in his cell at @entity10 , @entity11 , where he is serving an eight - year jail sentence for indecently assaulting eight women and girls in the 1970s and 1980s other ‘ inherently private ’ material included ‘ the @entity6 ’s interest in the birth ’ of @entity1 ’s son and details of gifts she gave him			1
@entity1 is seeking damages of up to £ 50,000 and an injunction banning @entity0 from using or publishing any private information about him			1
legal experts believe that if successful , the claim could lead to other public figures seeking similar gagging orders			0
in the past , @entity0 , now 71 , cast himself as the custodian of hundreds of celebrity secrets , claiming most of his work involved keeping stories out of newspapers			0
the writ says @entity1 , 56 , suffered ‘ substantial distress as a result of the misuse of his private information ’			2
however in a statement , @entity0 said it was an ‘ affront to common sense ’ to suggest @entity1 felt able to claim the information was confidential when ‘ he has sold stories to newspapers … and has even written a book about his dealings with the @entity83 ’			2
according to the writ , @entity1 first went to @entity0 wanting to ‘ stem the torrent of adverse publicity ’ following his arrest after allegations that £ 6 million worth of @entity19 ’s possessions went missing from her @entity90 apartments			1
the pr guru was alleged to have told @entity1 that his role was to protect people , but to do that he needed to know everything about them , and kept all his clients ’ secrets in a safe			0
@entity1 duly gave him the letter			0
but @entity0 , @entity1 claims , became extremely angry when he terminated his relationship with him in spring 2002 following a warning by his criminal defence team			2
@entity1 accuses @entity0 of faxing the letter to ms @entity35 at 11.58am on november 2 , 2002 – the morning after the butler was cleared of theft at the @entity106 after it was revealed the @entity6 had come forward with crucial evidence			1
he claims this was a breach of confidentiality and adds that he had previously ignored an offer of £ 450,000 from the paper for his story			0
in the book , @entity115 , @entity1 describes how he fell down stairs and ruptured a disc during a trip to @entity120			0
an ambulance took him to a nearby hospital which had ‘ already set aside a royal suite for an emergency ’ in line with procedure for royal visits			0
‘ it was the first time a crippled royal servant had slept in the @entity6 ’s bed , ’ he wrote .			0
