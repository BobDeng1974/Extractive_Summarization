a mother left unable to walk or talk after suffering a massive stroke has defied the odds to complete a university degree - by blinking			1
@entity4 was left with locked - in syndrome after the attack in 2003 , two weeks after her son @entity7 was born			1
the condition is where a patient is fully - aware and awake - but can not move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all muscles in the body , except for the eyes			1
incredibly , the former teacher , then 30 , discovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements			1
@entity4 ( pictured left aged 27 , in 2000 , three years before falling ill ) suffered a massive stroke in 2003 , two weeks after her son @entity7 was born ms @entity4 , now 42 , was left with locked - in syndrome after the stroke			1
she has now defied the odds to complete a degree , thanks to a specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text ms @entity4 ( left in 2000 at her teacher training graduation from @entity28 and right on her wedding day ) , had been suffering high blood pressure during her pregnancy which preceded the stroke she has now achieved a 2:2 degree in @entity34 and written an autobiography - all thanks to a specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text			1
living at her parents home in @entity40 , @entity41 , she began her degree in 2008 , determined not to be beaten by the condition			1
and finishing the @entity45 qualification has been no mean feat as her fastest writing pace of 50 words per hour has meant each three hour exam has taken three weeks			1
ms @entity4 , now 42 , worked three - hours a day on the degree , nudging buttons either side of her head to move the cursor on the screen and blinking to register the letters			1
six years on , she has completed the course with honours and is now hoping to tackle a masters in @entity60 ms @entity4 said : ' when i passed my degree , i was so pleased and proud of myself			1
' i had achieved my goal that i had for six years been striving for			1
' no matter what obstacles were in my way , such as getting pneumonia twice and other lesser illnesses , i was determined to reach my goal			2
' when i first had my stroke , i realised i would not be able to do anything physical			1
' i then decided to use the thing that had not been affected and that was my brain			2
after the stroke , she disovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements - and embarked on a degree in @entity34 six years on , and with each three - hour exam taking three weeks , she has graduated with a 2:2			1
ms @entity4 's parents and full - time carers , @entity79 and @entity80 , say they are delighted with her achievement ' i felt i needed to prove to myself and to others that i was still me , @entity4			1
' she added : ' [ my computer ] is my lifeline			2
never did i imagine when i got pregnant with @entity7 that my life would turn out like this			2
' her problems began when she was rushed to hospital at 26 weeks pregnant in and was diagnosed potentially fatal pre-eclampsia - a pregnancy condition associated with high blood pressure			1
over the next six days her health deteriorated , until her tiny baby had to be delivered by emergency caesarean weighing just 1lb 8oz			1
a week later ms @entity4 returned home - still suffering high blood pressure - but was told she would be fine			1
but another week on , her high blood pressure triggered a stroke			1
recalling the day she suffered the attack , she said : ' when i woke up that morning i immediately knew something was terribly wrong			2
i felt dizzy and faint			2
' i had pins and needles in my right side and when i went to speak , my voice was horribly slurred			2
' the last thing i remember properly is my mum , @entity80 , saying : " squeeze my hand if you are able " , because by that stage i could n't speak			2
ms @entity4 ( left , 29 , and right , aged 24 , at a christening ) had been a keen traveller before the stroke the now 42 - year - old at @entity114 in @entity115 with her son @entity7			1
she is now hoping to tackle a masters in @entity60 she said she was vaguely aware of a tracheostomy tube going into her neck to help her breathe and a tube being put into her nose			1
' i could hear traffic going by [ and remember ] a nurse washed my hair			2
' but was was missing , crucially , was her ability to speak			2
' my mind screamed that my brain was fine			2
but as i could n't speak , no one could hear me shouting that inside my paralysed body , my brain was still alive , ' she said			0
' @entity132 [ her now ex-husband ] , my parents and older brother @entity131 visited daily			0
over the following week , she drifted in and out of consciousness but was unable to move or talk			0
her condition got so bad her eye muscles even were paralysed			0
she listened , motionless , while her family discussed her condition and doctors told her husband to prepare for the worst			0
locked - in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is fully - aware and awake but can not move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all muscles in the body , except for the eyes			1
total locked - in syndrome is a version of locked - in syndrome where the eyes are paralysed too			1
it can be caused by a traumatic brain injury , a brain stem stroke or medication overdose			1
there is no cure for locked - in syndrome , nor is there a standard course of treatment			1
a therapy called functional neuromuscular stimulation , which uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes , may help activate some paralysed muscles			0
several devices to help communication are available			0
other treatment is symptomatic and supportive			0
' they would talk to me , talk to one another and to the nurses , ' recalls ms @entity4			0
' but all i could do was lie there hopelessly watching them , listening for snippets of news about how @entity7 was			0
' for long hours , i lay staring up at a blank ceiling , living for visiting hours when at least i could hear my family 's chatter			0
' inside i cried , but no tears came out			0
when people saw me , they had no idea i was as wide awake as ever			0
' no matter how hard she tried , ms @entity4 was unable to move her fingers to tell people she was still alive and was left staring at the ceiling as the weeks passed			1
a breakthrough came when she was finally able to blink , and let her father @entity79 , who had been at her bedside the entire time , know she was still inside her broken body			0
' my dad asked me if i could hear him - and told me to blink if i could			1
[ when ] i blinked , he jumped up in shock			0
' she was soon fitted with the laptop that allowed her to communicate , but her joy was short lived as just months later her husband @entity132 walked out			1
' when @entity132 left me it was a crushing blow ; i had always believed we married in sickness and in health , ' said ms @entity4			1
' i was sure if it had been the other way round - and this had happened to him - i would always have been there for him			2
' he later wrote a letter to me saying he had cried about what we had lost together			0
he had found our cottage somehow haunted and changed without me			0
' he saw us both as victims , alone and confused			0
' ms @entity4 said : ' when i passed my degree , i was so pleased and proud of myself			2
i had achieved my goal that i had for six years been striving for ' speaking yesterday about his daughter 's progess , ms @entity4 's father , who is her full - time carer along with wife @entity80 , 75 , said they were ' over the moon ' with her progress			1
the 80 - year - old said : ' it 's amazing she has managed to do this considering her condition			2
we are so proud of her			0
she worked so hard to get there			0
' before her stroke she used to love travelling			2
@entity228 was one of her favourite places to visit because of her love of history			0
' she lived a very active life			0
she used to like walking and going to @entity235 properties up and down the country			0
' it was heartbreaking to see her go through all of this			0
but she has n't given up			0
she has her bad days , as anyone in her situation would , but she is determined to keep going			0
' we have to look after her 24/7			0
we took her and @entity7 to @entity242 the other day , there was n't access for her into the @entity244 so when we came back she contacted the castle to say there should be better access for people in wheelchairs			0
' she is very proactive about things like that			0
' she is graduating in october up in @entity253 , it 's going to be such a proud moment for us all			0
