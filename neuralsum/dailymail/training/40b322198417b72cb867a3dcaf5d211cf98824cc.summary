@entity1 ’s most overcrowded train routes were named yesterday , as it emerged some carry double the number of passengers they should at peak times			1
the 4.46pm from @entity7 to @entity8 came out on top , with more people forced to stand than can find seats , according to figures from the @entity13			1
last autumn , the @entity15 service carried an average of 435 standard - class passengers at its most crowded point , more than twice its seated capacity of 206			1
the findings in a new government ‘ league table ’ of cramped carriages come amid rising anger over soaring train fares , bumper rail profits and poor punctuality , that has led angry passengers to demand better value for money			1
full to bursting : this map shows trains into almost all the biggest cities in @entity44 and @entity45 are running over-capacity , on average , at peak times ( red bar )			1
100 per cent capacity already means many people are standing second worst was @entity52 ’ 7.32am commuter service from @entity53 to @entity54 , which was designed to carry 738 passengers but actually crammed 1,278 on board - or 540 more than it should			1
it was followed by the 7.21am @entity58 to @entity60 service operated by @entity61 – dubbed ‘ @entity62 ’ by disgruntled passengers - which was 73 per cent overcrowded			1
and on the 6.33pm @entity67 service , 806 passengers squeezed into a space designed for 476 – or 330 too many			2
but @entity7 was not the only city affected			1
@entity71 ’s 6.30am service from @entity72 to @entity73 was 66 per cent over capacity , with 275 people in a space designed for 166			2
stifling : a routine scene on peak time trains from @entity79 in @entity7			1
the capital was hit the worst the report from the @entity13 also looked at overcrowding in @entity83			0
here again the 4.46pm to @entity8 had more than double the passengers it should have carroied			1
it crammed 414 passengers into space for 206 – some 208 more than it should			2
@entity90 , leader of the @entity92 rail union , said : ‘ commuters are being treated worse than cattle when it comes to overcrowding because @entity98 laws prevent animals being transported in such cramped conditions			0
' our real time train figures show four out of every 10 trains in the @entity104 actually running late , means they are getting the worst of all worlds , overcrowded and slow trains			1
' attack : @entity110 transport secretary @entity109 described the report as a ' misery map ' the new @entity114 figures show that nearly a quarter ( 24 per cent ) of morning peak trains into the capital are overcrowded with six out of ten passengers left standing			1
just under one million passengers arrive into central @entity7 every day			1
the report notes : ‘ in @entity7 , 120,000 passengers had to stand at trains ’ busiest points in the morning peak , 20 per cent of the overall total			1
’ based on rail journeys on a typical autumn weekday in 2013 , the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) figures showed crowding figures for @entity7 , nine other @entity44 cities and @entity131			2
overcrowding in @entity7 was worst at @entity60 , while there were large increases in overcrowding compared with autumn 2012 at @entity134 , @entity7 , @entity135 and @entity137 stations			2
@entity61 was the train company with highest level of overcrowding of any @entity7 and south east @entity44 operator			2
the next - worse was @entity15			0
peak overcrowding across the 11 cities surveyed saw 2.6 per cent of passengers exceeding the capacity of the trains they were travelling on			1
overcrowding was higher in the three - hour morning peak from 7am to 10am , with 3.4per cent passengers in excess of capacity – the official measure			1
overcrowding was higher in @entity7 than in other cities , with an average rate of 3.1 per cent compared to 1 per cent across the other ten cities			2
the highest overcrowding outside @entity7 was in @entity158 , which had 2.6 per cent rate			2
on @entity163 the design of new trains , with fewer seats , meant that in autumn 2013 as many as 50.8 per cent of passengers stood in the morning peak and 45.4 per cent stood in the afternoon peak			2
@entity167 , the director of watchdog @entity168 , said : ‘ overcrowding is a daily struggle for many commuters			0
our latest rail passenger survey found that 30 per cent of commuters were unhappy about overcrowding on their train			0
’ unpleasant : on the @entity163 ( pictured ) around half of all passengers stand in peak times rammed : on average , peak trains into the capital run 3.1 per cent over capacity , but some are much worse there was fury this week as thousands of commuters saw their rail fares double			1
changes imposed by the government on the main rail company in the north of @entity44 , @entity193 , mean some people will be paying 162 per cent more than they did last friday			0
it forced @entity193 to introduce evening peak ticket restrictions on local services to plug the gap caused by the cost to the taxpayer of the @entity202 franchise saga in 2012			0
to soften the blow mr @entity204 also announced that countrywide inflation - busting fare rises planned in january will be limited to the rate of inflation in july - 2.5 per cent – and not rise by an above - inflationary 3.5 per cent as previously planned			0
mr @entity204 is also scrapping the ‘ flex ’ system where companies could raise some fares by up to two percentage points			0
he said more than 250,000 season ticket holders will save £ 75 across 2014 and 2015			0
a big increase in capacity was needed to cope with increased demand for trains , he said			0
he added : ‘ this means continued investment in new and longer trains to meet existing demand , as well as ensuring that overcrowding does n’t get worse as passenger numbers increase as predicted			0
' @entity223 of the @entity224 said : ‘ these figures show overcrowding is getting worse at the country ’s main stations			0
‘ with up to one - in - five passengers having to stand and ticket prices increasing much faster than wages , rail commuters will be questioning the value for money they get			0
’ @entity236 ’s shadow transport secretary @entity109 said : ‘ as well as enduring inflation - busting fares increases , this misery map of the most - crowded services shows the reality of life for commuters under @entity243			0
' some services are carrying twice as many passengers as they should , a far cry from the " comfortable commuting " which out - of - touch ministers imagine on the railways			0
’ transport minister @entity250 said : ‘ i understand the frustration of rail passengers forced to stand on busy services and that is why i am calling on the operators to do more			0
‘ since 1995 passenger journeys on the railway have more than doubled , with 1.6billion journeys being recorded in the last year			0
worst - hit : the most overcrowded service was the 4.46pm from @entity7 ( pictured ) to @entity8			1
the four carriage train had space for 206 standard class passengers , including many standing , but actually carried 435 ‘ this means that on too many journeys , passengers have to stand in cramped conditions			1
train operators must act now , they must find new ways to create space on the network and in their trains			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity275 , representing @entity276 and rail operators , blamed the growth in passenger numbers over the last 15 years for the problem			0
‘ the official measure of crowding during peak times now compared with then has remained largely unchanged despite a doubling in passenger journeys , ' the spokesman said			1
' but we recognise that some services remain crowded and understand people ’s frustration when they can not get a seat			0
’ train companies were planning to increase peak - time seats into and out of many major cities by a third in the next five years , the spokesman added .			2

trains into almost every major city are running over capacity in peak times
worst service , 4.46pm @entity7 to @entity8 , was at more than double capacity
it had room for 206 passengers including many standing - but carried 435
