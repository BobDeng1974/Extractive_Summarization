this is @entity1 's season			1
coasting to the @entity4 title and now with a glistening piece of silverware in the cabinet , times are good again at @entity8			0
this was as straightforward as a @entity11 final gets for @entity13 's team , who reaped the first rewards of what has been a stunning season by easily seeing off the challenge of @entity19			1
in front of 40,000 jubilant fans , they lifted the @entity23 following goals from @entity25 and @entity26			1
but it 's merely a taste of what is to come			2
captain @entity30 ( centre ) lifts the @entity23 as his @entity1 team - mates celebrate their triumph @entity13 ( left ) and @entity34 look delighted after winning the trophy and @entity1 have a terrific chance of a domestic double @entity26 ( 2 ) bundles home the second goal after a goal mouth scrambled left him a clear goal to aim at with a 10 - point advantage over their nearest challengers in @entity44 , @entity1 will surely also be lifting a trophy the next time they meet @entity19 , in the last game of the season on may 3			1
winning this competition for the third time in their history is a nice distraction , but @entity13 will demand his players remain focused on the season 's primary task of returning to the championship			1
the job is almost done			0
like so often in this campaign , they were in control from start to finish here , showing the greater assurance in front of goal in a game of few chances			0
the full back celebrates in front of the @entity1 fans after he doubled his side 's lead @entity11 looked a picture in the spring sunshine , a sea of red with thousands of supporters descending on the national stadium			1
@entity1 : fielding ; @entity26 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 ( @entity85 87 ) ; @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 ( @entity89 90 ) ; @entity90 ( @entity34 88 ) , @entity91 ( c ) substitutes not used : @entity92 ( gk ) ; @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 scorers : @entity82 15 ; little 51 @entity19 : @entity97 ; @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 ; @entity102 , @entity103 ( c ) ; @entity104 ( @entity105 74 ) , @entity106 , @entity107 ( @entity108 80 ) ; @entity109 ( @entity110 61 ) substitutes not used : @entity111 ( gk ) ; @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 booked : @entity106 referee : @entity116 ( @entity117 ) attendance : 72,315 all the pre-match indications pointed to a @entity1 victory			1
well clear of @entity122 at the @entity4 summit , it would take a @entity125 - style collapse to deny them a return to the second tier after two seasons away			0
the @entity130 sit 16th in the standings , some 37 points behind their opponents , but were still optimistic of springing a surprise as they arrived at @entity11 for the first time in their 127 - year history			2
they more than matched their opponents in the opening exchanges , with the goal threatened at both ends			0
@entity1 fired the first salvo when @entity88 's 20 - yard hit cleared the bar on four minutes , @entity19 responding when @entity104 tested goalkeeper @entity144 from range			1
then , on the quarter - hour , a breakthrough			0
@entity1 won a corner and @entity150 's corner was pinged to the back post			1
@entity25 , completely outmuscling his marker to gain the necessary elevation , headed home and sparked delirium among the visitors from @entity157			2
the tempo of the game immediately dropped and both teams constructed spells of tidy passing football without finding any penetration			0
chances were at a premium and scoring opportunities snuffed out as defences dominated			0
the best of the half - chances came shortly before the break when @entity19 's @entity101 whistled a shot over from the edge of the box but there was little else to report			0
you sensed that a second @entity1 goal may settle the contest and it duly arrived six minutes after the break			2
@entity25 ( left ) scores the opening goal for @entity1 during the @entity180 the big centre half runs away to celebrate his opening goal at @entity11 for @entity1 @entity88 's tricky feet worked space to cross from the left and after @entity97 blocked @entity26 's first header , he followed up and bundled the ball home with his knee from a few yards out			1
it was all little deserved for a fine performance in which he was constantly looking for ways to unpick the @entity19 defence			0
but far from being subdued , @entity19 almost responded when @entity107 's vicious inswinging cross from the left had to be touched onto the post by @entity144			2
the guests from the @entity199 were briefly encouraged but it did n't spark the resurgence they needed			0
city were content to sit back and soak up the pressure , duly claiming the first of what will surely be twin trophies this season			0
fans make thier way into the stadium prior to the cup final where @entity1 came away as winners @entity83 is joined by his team - mates and goalscorers @entity25 , and @entity26 to pose for a celebratory photograph @entity30 lifts the trophy high towards the @entity1 fans after comfortably winning the competition at @entity11			1

@entity25 gave @entity1 the lead at @entity11 after 15 minutes with a towering header at the far post
@entity26 doubled the lead when he bundled the ball into the net with *replays* showing it hit his hand
@entity13 's side deserved the win over the 90 minutes and lifted the @entity23
