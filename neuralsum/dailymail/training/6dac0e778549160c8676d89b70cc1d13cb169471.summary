by @entity0 published : 05:09 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 7 may 2013 @entity3 intelligence pressured the writer of the film @entity5 to alter or remove scenes of torture from the script , it has been revealed			2
the blockbuster film about the killing of @entity11 , dubbed a ' publicity coup ' for the @entity13 and @entity15 administration , had scenes cut or rewritten at the request of the agency			1
it was already known that the filmmakers had been provided with secret information about how the raid was planned , but the latest revelations show the extent to which spies shaped its narrative			0
among them is a secret 2012 memo which summarises five conference calls between mr @entity46 and the @entity13 's @entity50 in late 2011			1
during these conversations , @entity42 reports , mr @entity46 ' verbally shared the screenplay ' for @entity5 , allowing the @entity13 's press officers to give their feedback and suggest changes			2
one major alteration suggested by the @entity13 comes in the film 's controversial opening scene , in which its protagonist , @entity13 agent @entity32 , played by @entity34 , watches as a prisoner is tortured during interrogation			1
an earlier version of the script had @entity32 participating in the torture , which included waterboarding and shoving the man into a tiny box , but the @entity13 told mr @entity46 this was not true to life			1
collusion : screenwriter @entity46 had a string of conference calls with the @entity13 's pr department in which he ' verbally shared the screenplay ' according to the memo : ' we emphasised that substantive debriefers [ like @entity32 ] died not administer @entity79 , because in this scene he had a non-interrogator , substantive debriefer assisting in a dosing technique			1
' the next sentence is redacted			0
but it then goes on : ' @entity46 said he would fix this			0
' that scene provoked much critical debate , with @entity32 's ambivalence and observer status scoured for artistic meaning			1
' of course , the scene reads a bit differently if the choice was dictated by a @entity13 propaganda officer , ' remarks @entity42 writer @entity95			1
a second scene which the @entity13 took issue with , according to a memo , featured a dog intimidating a prisoner			1
' we raised an objection that such tactics would not be used by the @entity105 , ' says the memo			0
' @entity46 confirmed in january that the use of dogs was taken out of the screenplay			2
' of course , threatening detainees with dogs - an animal which @entity113 tend to be culturally averse to - has been a well - known tactic in the @entity115			0
the technique , which is sanctioned in certain circumstances in @entity119 interrogation manuals , was pioneered in @entity120 and features in some of the most disturbing photos of the abuses at @entity124			0
the memo obtained by @entity42 is just the latest document to be released revealing the extent of the collusion between the @entity13 and the makers of @entity5			2
in january it was revealed that ms @entity45 and mr @entity46 were provided with a complete ' roadmap ' of how the @entity133 raid was planned during a 45 minute meeting with @entity135 - the country 's highest ranking civilian intelligence official			0
the filmmakers also received briefings from top @entity13 and military intelligence officers and @entity140 who carried out @entity141 - the code name for the attack on @entity11 's compound in @entity144 in may 2011			2
those releases followed a freedom of information request by campaign group @entity147			0
its president @entity148 accused the @entity150 of acting improperly by giving ' politically - connected filmmakers extraordinary and secret access to @entity11 raid information ' the group accused the @entity15 administration of sharing the ' intimate details ' to help the filmmakers release a movie â€˜ perfectly timed to give a home - stretch boost ' president @entity15 's re-election campaign last year .			0
