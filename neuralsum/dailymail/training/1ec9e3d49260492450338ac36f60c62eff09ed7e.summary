click here for the latest leaderboard from @entity2 nothing more could be asked from an opening day at @entity2 than the two biggest names setting out their stall alongside the world number one before a raucous audience of lucky sunbathers at @entity10			1
@entity11 ’s sumptuous 66 to set the pace was nothing less than expected , of course , since he ’s become thursday ’s child			1
this was the fifth time in 14 starts this season he has led following the opening day			1
neither would anyone be too surprised that @entity21 made light of the fact he was playing in the more difficult afternoon conditions to demonstrate why he began the event as favourite			1
given the wind ’s added strength his 68 was perhaps the equal of the leader ’s score in terms of merit			1
certainly , those pundits who wrote him off in the build - up must be shifting uneasily in their seats			1
kidding himself if he thinks he can win ? there was enough compelling evidence here to emphasise the point that the most futile punditry of all is calling into question the prospects of the fourteen - time major champion			2
this was his first round in a major for 11 months owing to back surgery in march but the sight of him skipping onto the media podium following his three under par 69 , before marching merrily to the practice ground , illustrated that the 38 year old is healthy again and back in business			1
what a leaderboard we have already			2
fireworks were promised and duly delivered at this wonderful venue			2
how on earth did the @entity2 go 39 years from 1967 - 2006 without being played here ? back to his best ? @entity44 managed an impressive round of 69 on his return from a serious back injury confident : @entity44 believes winning the @entity81 is a realistic goal despite his lack of playing time this year @entity84 @entity44 press conference in contention : @entity21 lived up to his billing as the bookmakers ' favourite with a round of 68 on thursday players who made double - bogey or worse on the brutal 480 - yard , par - four seventh hole			1
only five players made a birdie there			2
evocative stories pulled at the full range of emotions			2
when was the last time two brothers were tied third after the first day of an @entity2 , for example ? the @entity102 and @entity103 shared bragging rights with their 68s but still lost out by a stroke for top @entity107 to @entity108 , now thankfully emerging from his half - season funk			1
also on 68 is gentleman @entity110 , determined to atone for his last day failings at @entity112 at the @entity113 this year and who must have impressed his playing partner , none other than captain @entity117			1
remember @entity118 , dressed all in yellow on the final day here in 2006 , to the vast amusement of the man who beat him on that occasion ? woods duly texted a friend : ' i ’ve just killed tweety - pie			1
' dressed all in black , one of the nearly men of major championship golf is also on the popular four under par mark			2
then there was the other end of the scale and the @entity135 , who qualified by finishing fourth in his national @entity2 last december but is now suffering so badly from the yips the poor soul failed to break 90			1
young gun : @entity108 finds himself in outright second place after a fine round of 67 in @entity141 finding his form : @entity143 @entity118 ( right ) also shone during a sun - drenched opening day at @entity2 still going strong : veteran @entity110 has put himself in position near the top of the leaderboard the game takes lumps out of everyone at some point			1
two years ago on the @entity155 coast @entity153 was crowned champion			2
here he began with a triple bogey seven , including three putts from no more than 12 inches , his concentration shattered after his tee shot struck an unlucky spectator flush in the face			1
@entity44 began slowly too , with bogeys on the first two holes			2
by his side , @entity167 ’s imperious ball - striking early on offered a sharp contrast			0
things started to change at the fourth			0
woods had struck a tentative putt at the second from 6ft to miss but here from the same distance there was something of the old authority to instil some confidence			1
a lovely up and down for his first birdie at the 5th was followed by a series of pars before the next key moment at the 11th , where he holed from off the green			0
talk about a light switch going on			0
at the next two holes @entity44 struck gorgeous approach shots that led to two more birdies , followed by further gains at the 15th and 16th			0
five birdies in six holes , then			0
someone asked : did it feel like old times ? ‘ it ’s not that long ago , ’ said @entity44 , smiling			0
‘ i did win five times last year			0
’ frustrated figure : @entity153 endured a nightmare front nine and ended the day seven over par slip up : @entity201 's @entity167 got himself to two under par but finished with a round of 72 after under par : @entity205 , pictured here playing his approach on the 14th , came away with a first round 71 there have been winners who have received a less rapturous reception than the one afforded @entity171 at the 18th			1
part of it is to do with what happened in 2006 , of course , when @entity44 found an inner peace here , to use his own words , following the death of his father @entity219 that april			0
clearly , the locals are rather taken by the thought they might be able to help out again , as he looks to end a drought in the majors stretching back six years			0
the wind had freshened by the time @entity21 and @entity226 stepped on to the first tee			0
both oozing with confidence , it showed over the front nine with @entity21 , in particular , striking a series of quite majestic blows			0
when he reached the turn in 31 shots , with three par fives to come , it looked as if the @entity236 would threaten @entity11 ’s lead			1
the back nine proved a beast for the late starters , however , and he pick up no more strokes to par. @entity241 bogeyed the 12th and 14th and had to settle for a 72			0
just behind , sentimental favourite @entity205 showed he retains plenty of fight as he battled manfully to a 71			0
leading @entity244 ? twenty - four year old amateur @entity245 , from the same small @entity247 village of @entity248 that produced @entity249			0
it was a day to score then , with the wind expected to blow significantly on friday morning			0
we ’ve seen the best players plunder			0
now , can they protect ?			0

@entity11 shot a first round 66 to lead @entity2 by one shot
@entity107 @entity108 is second after finishing on 67
