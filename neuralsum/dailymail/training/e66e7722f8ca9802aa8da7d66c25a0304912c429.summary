an animal charity has launched a spoof website which , upon first inspection , appears to let users ' exchange ' their dogs for puppies			1
the @entity8 's thought - provoking campaign , dubbed @entity9 , advertises a subscription service which allows pet - owners to browse through breeds , order puppies and then trade them in as soon as they get older and ' less cute			1
' ' @entity9 is n’t real ' , the website admits			1
' unfortunately , pet abandonment is			2
for a @entity35 , one reads : ' they grow up way too fast			2
great for the short term			0
' similarly , a review on a @entity39 reads : ' ca n't go wrong with a classic			0
on my fifth one already			0
' in an ad for the website , the chirpy voice - over states : ' the moment your puppy grows up , becomes a bother or gets less likable , simply log back into your account and swap out your old best friend for a brand new one			1
' fake : ' @entity9 is n’t real ' , the website admits after its initial sell ( pictured )			1
' unfortunately , pet abandonment is ' making a point : users can browse breeds for puppies based on their ' social likability ' and ' cute factor ' according to the @entity8 , 180,000 animals enter @entity63 shelters each year			1
tragically , 40per cent will never leave			0
' help us spread the word , ' says the website			2
' pet ownership is for life			0
' the ad , which has been seen over 80,000 times since it was uploaded to @entity71 last week , has fooled a fair few viewers			0
not just for @entity73 : the tongue - in - cheek website features fake reviews from customers on specific breeds ' what a f * * * * * g stupid idea ! ! what 's next ? baby swap ? then what the f * * k will happen to the dog ? how about its feelings ? just wrong in so many ways , ' one commenter wrote			1
others , who managed to watch the ad until the end , at which point all becomes clear , were more complimentary of the viral marketing effort			0
' great satire piece on a horrible thing humans do , ' one surmised .			0

the spoof website was *created* by the @entity8 as part of an *awareness* campaign
a *staggering* 180,000 animals enter @entity63 shelters each year , many abandoned by their owners , and 40 *%* of them will never find homes
the fake site allows users to ' order ' puppies *online* and then swap them when they grow up to be ' less cute '
