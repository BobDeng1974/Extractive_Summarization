by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 01:22 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 10:05 est , 26 october 2012 as comedians and talk show hosts have their way with @entity5 over his ' huge ' announcement the real estate mogul is sticking to his guns in his first live tv appearance since making the request			1
@entity5 was a guest on the @entity11 , to further explain the offer - which turned out to be a $ 5million charity donation in exchange for @entity17 's old college and passport records			1
when asked by @entity18 why he was orchestrating the demand , @entity5 replied : ' transparency			1
' he added : ' there 's too much we do n't know about our president			0
' i hope everything [ in @entity17 's records ] is perfect - and it might be			0
' ' if it was negative - there would n't be an election			0
' on the subject of @entity17 ’s birth certificate , @entity5 said that it took @entity17 six years to provide it , when ‘ i could give it to you in less than an hour			0
' sticking to his guns : @entity5 , seen outside the @entity54 in @entity55 , is standing by his offer of $ 5million to the charity of president @entity17 's choice if he releases the records marketing : @entity5 also discussed his line of shirts and ties , all of which are made in @entity66 and @entity67 , respectively as the audience applauded , @entity5 raised his hands , relishing in the moment on the late night stage			1
but @entity18 ordered the crowd to stop clapping , saying ' the breeze will disturb [ @entity5 's ] hair			1
' moving along , @entity5 said that what he likes most about @entity77 presidential candidate @entity76 is his stance on @entity67 before showing off his shirt and tie line currently being sold at @entity82 ’s stores			0
but as @entity18 quickly revealed , the ties were made in @entity67			2
hours earlier , @entity5 has received an counter-offer to his ' bordering - on - gigantic ' news about the president			1
@entity5 had hyped his ' big reveal ' for several days on major news outlets while incessantly tweeting about his ' game changer ' information in the final weeks before the election			1
political satirist @entity92 has now ramped up the stakes for the @entity94 star by offering @entity5 a donation to a charity of his choice - with rather more x-rated consequences			1
payback : @entity92 ( left ) offered @entity5 ( right ) $ 1million charity donation for an expletive act as a counter-offer to the $ 5million @entity5 told @entity17 he would donate to charity in exchange for his college records on his @entity108 show @entity107 , the sarcastic host told the audience : ' mr @entity5 , i will write you a cheque to the charity of your choice for $ 1million ...			1
if you will let me dip my balls in your mouth			0
' @entity92 added : ' nothing would make me happier than to write this cheque ... and nothing would make @entity38 happier than something going into your mouth instead of coming out of it			0
' @entity5 had yet to respond to @entity92 's offer which the comic set for ' 5pm on october 31 ' - the same deadline that @entity5 gave the president			1
@entity5 made his @entity128 offer on wednesday at noon , promising to donate $ 5million to a charity of the president 's choice if he revealed the information			1
the tycoon denied his elaborate staging was a publicity stunt , insisting this was ' not a media event ' , but instead is ' about the @entity38 '			0
@entity92 , who is left - leaning , was far from the only public figure to mock the billionaire businessman			1
repeat guest : this was mr @entity17 's fifth time on @entity143 ; the president is in the middle of a campaign blitz broadcaster @entity147 scolded her ' friend ' on @entity150 today saying : ' @entity5 , you 're not hurting @entity17 , you 're hurting @entity5 , and that hurts me because you 're a decent man			2
' @entity5 was characteristically unrepentant today , returning to @entity154 to directly respond : ' @ @entity155 @ theviewtv -- why did you choose me as one of the @entity159 last season ( and more than once ? ) ' the @entity160 exploded yesterday with mock responses to the @entity94 star 's announcement			2
comedian @entity163 tweeted : ' attention parents : if you give your children even the tiniest bit of attention now , maybe they wo n't grow up to be @entity5			0
' observers on the right also slated @entity5 , who has publicly endorsed @entity77 @entity76			0
@entity170 of the conservative @entity171 , wrote : ' if at any point you seriously considered @entity5 for president , please study the error of your ways in quiet , private contemplation			2
' however there was support for @entity5 's actions with those echoing his call for most transparency from the president including conservative talk show host @entity185 and @entity187			2
defence : @entity5 took to @entity154 to claim that his announcement was public - spirited , not self - serving there are a number of conspiracy theories surrounding @entity17 's college records , the most popular being that he had poor grades and that he had attended college as a foreign exchange student			1
the latter ties into @entity5 's other argument , the so - called ' birther ' conspiracy , that the president was born in @entity201 and not @entity202 thus making him ineligible for the @entity203			1
although a @entity203 response was not expected , @entity17 addressed the matter directly when he appeared on the @entity206 last night			0
@entity17 told the tv host that the rivalry between himself and @entity5 began in their childhood			2
‘ this all dates back to when we were growing up in @entity201 , ' he joked			0
' we had constant run - ins on the soccer field , he was n’t very good			0
’ it had been suggested that @entity5 's revelation was that he had unearthed divorce papers between the president and his wife @entity220			2
the claims about divorce papers have previously been made in a book released earlier this year by author @entity223			0
the @entity203 rubbished the allegations then and claimed @entity223 had a history of making things up			0
friends and enemies : @entity5 and @entity17 are very public enemies but the billionaire mogul has endorsed @entity77 challenger @entity76			2
