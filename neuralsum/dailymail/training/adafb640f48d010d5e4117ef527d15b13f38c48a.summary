@entity0 says that he was always confident he could help @entity1 win against @entity2 from the bench if called upon - and he did just that as he came on to score in their 2 - 1 comeback victory			1
strikes from @entity0 and fellow substitute @entity7 turned the match around after @entity9 had scored @entity2 's first @entity11 goal in 28 years from the penalty spot to put the @entity13 into a shock 24th - minute lead			1
and @entity0 has revealed he knew he would be able to contribute positively if coach @entity16 turned to him			1
' one thing i know is that if my team - mates put crosses in the box for me , i can score goals			1
and you saw it today			0
' three times the ball came in for me and every time i won the header - i could have had a hat - trick			2
' i 'm just glad that one went in though because we were beginning to run out of time , and it was important we took one of our chances			0
' in the end , i think we got what we deserved			1
we started very nervously and played badly in the first half			0
' but i think you saw the character of this team in the second half			0
we just needed to stay calm , make the right decisions , and doing that got us this fantastic result			2
substitute : @entity0 ( centre ) came off the bench to make the difference for his national side bench : @entity1 coach @entity16 ' two substitutes , @entity0 and @entity7 , scored against @entity2 ' i 'm really happy , both for myself and for the team			1
' scoring at a @entity11 was a great moment for me and i immediately thought about my family , who always supported me through the years no matter what			1
' everything they did for me led to that moment			0
' the 26 - year - old midfielder tweeted a photo after the match with his team - mates , accompanied with the caption : ' well done for the first game			1
now focus for the second one			0
' @entity1 captain @entity35 tweeted a selfie on the flight after the match with the words : ' night time flight ! going back to home base ! # @entity102 # @entity104			2
' and @entity0 was also quick to lavish praise on his fellow @entity26 squad members , saying that any of the 23 - man squad could have been called upon and made the difference			1
it was @entity0 and @entity7 on this occasion , but the 6ft 4in midfielder believes it could be someone else who changes the match next time around			1
he said : ' everyone can see that it was guys who came off the bench who made the difference today			2
' that 's always possible with this team anyway because you know that we have a lot of strength throughout the squad			0
it 's not just about the first 11 with us			0
depth : @entity0 ( left ) was the substitute this time , but says any member of the 23 can change games big money : @entity0 ( left ) signed for @entity132 from @entity133 for £ 27.5million last summer ' and although it was me and the other two today , there are others who stayed on the bench who can be big and important players for @entity1 at this @entity11			1
' @entity0 endured a difficult season at @entity132 following a £ 27.5million move from @entity133 , but before the tournament @entity16 predicted that ' the @entity11 will be a good opportunity for him to take his revenge '			1
after being reminded of @entity16 ' anecdote , a smiling @entity0 responded : ' i hope he 's right			2
' i 've definitely been looking forward to this tournament			0
it 's my first @entity11 and it 's amazing to be part of it all			2
