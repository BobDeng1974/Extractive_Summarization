the rising cost of potatoes is forcing them from the daily menu			1
they have more than tripled in price from £ 91 - a - tonne in 2012 to £ 295 this year , meaning schools can no longer afford to fry , roast or mash them			1
so instead of featuring in every meal , potatoes will be served up just two or three times a week in some schools			1
cutbacks : schoolchildren will be offered rice or noodles as an alternative to potatoes in order to cut costs , @entity16 has said rain , snow and ice through one of the wettest winters and coldest springs on record led to a shortage of home - grown potatoes , with imports having to make up the shortfall			1
@entity35 announced the news yesterday , saying potato dishes in its school dinners would be replaced by rice and noodles			1
a spokesman said school cooks had also noticed a downturn in the quality of potatoes			1
@entity45 , the council ’s head of catering and facilities management , said : ‘ the impact for school meals has been the rising price of potatoes , especially jackets , where wholesale prices have doubled and the quality is poor			2
‘ other potatoes used for mashing and roasting are also sometimes poor and cooks have to be selective in what they can use			2
’ off the menu : the rising price of potatoes means @entity16 is cutting back on the number of days they will be served up to schoolchildren in the area costly : the authority said the measures were being put in place after the cost of potatoes more than tripled in the space of a year mr @entity45 said the situation had ‘ put pressure on the schools meals service ’ , which charges £ 2 - a - meal			1
he said children had reacted positively to the new recipes which included braised rice and oriental noodles			1
some farmers have been forced to plant this year ’s potato crop a month late because of poor conditions , placing even more pressure on last year ’s stocks			1
the @entity85 says the yield for 2012 was about 20 per cent lower than 2011 , and with fewer acres under cultivation the total decrease was about 24 per cent			2
school dinners are not the only victims of the potato shortage			2
cornish pasty makers have warned the rising cost of potatoes may force them to increase the cost of a pasty as well			2
some farmers were also forced to plant this year ’s crop a month late because of the poor conditions , placing even more pressure on 2012 ’s limited stocks			1
last week @entity103 farmer @entity102 told the @entity106 ’s @entity105 programme : ' this season ’s crop is well behind last year ’s crop which was bad enough as it was			1
' with the shortfalls from last year there is bound to be shortages of potatoes , whether they come from abroad to fill the gap , that ’s going to be for quite a considerable time			1
' mr @entity102 said he had ' just a few pallets ' left at his farm in @entity103			0
one @entity121 food retailer specialising in jacket potatoes said : ' the price of jacket potatoes has gone through the roof in the last two weeks			2
price rise : potatoes cost triple the amount per ton today that they did a year ago ' i have never seen the price of raw materials rise as fast as we have seen in the last few weeks			1
' however , the @entity85 disputed the council 's claim that quality had suffered			0
spokeswoman @entity136 said : ' you may notice that potatoes are smaller and have more marks on their skins as a result of growing conditions			0
' this should not affect their cooking or eating qualities			0
we hope that everyone will continue to support the industry in a difficult season			0
' the @entity152 spokesperson for the area , @entity151 , said it was concerning that the council - a supporter of local food industries - had decided to make the cuts			0
' we know that @entity35 is committed to buying local food so we are disappointed to see that commitment is suffering , ' she said			0
' we of course , understand that schools have budget concerns			0
' if the prices come back down , we hope that @entity164 will return to their proud suppliers			0
' @entity166 , business leader at the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity169 , negotiates catering contracts for the school			0
@entity172 organises its own ingredients budget , and mr @entity166 said that the rising price of potatoes had become a concern			0
he added : ' there has been a noticeable increase in the price of certain products			0
' we have been able to maintain our menu without having to increase the price , and we ’re conscious that parents need to able to afford school lunches			0
