' it means i have to pull the big heavy frames out and if we are lucky and its the right time of year , we drain it together to collect honey to sell and have it in our porridge for breakfast			2
' last saturday i was pulling out one of the frames and noticed there was a weird sign on one side			0
' i thought it was the @entity45 sign because i 'd seen it before on my @entity47 's car			0
but @entity48 was really amazed and said the circle with the three lines inside meant world peace			0
' ' pollen ' their leg : @entity6 first associated the sign with that of @entity45 , but was told of its true meaning by her father while they worked at the family bee farm the father - daughter team have been running @entity6 's @entity25 for three years , and balance it on the side of schoolwork and mr @entity65 's job in recruitment			1

' bees fill each cell in a piece of comb with honey and cap it off , but sometimes a few holes or large patches will just get missed and left uncapped			0
