an intricate etching on ostrich eggs joined together to make a sphere is the oldest globe of the @entity4 ever to be discovered			1
latin inscriptions and delicate outlines of countries informed by knowledge of explorers such as @entity10 , made in the early 1500s cover the sphere , but the origin of the globe is a mystery			1
a cartographer believes the globe could have been made in @entity17 , @entity18 and claims that the skilful engraver could even have crafted the object in the workshop of @entity23			1
