it 's a mother 's job to make sure her children learn how to fend for themselves			1

the images show a reluctant and nervous looking lion cub being taught to hunt wildebeest by his mother on the @entity5 plain in @entity20 even though her cubs look nervous , the mother is insistent that they must learn to hunt and tries to grab the attention of the wildebeest after grabbing the animal 's attention , it is then down to the two young cubs to take over as they begin to chase the defenceless animal but the devoted mother is insistent that her cubs must learn how to hunt and approaches the prey to grab its attention			1
as she walks away , her two cubs then attack the defenceless wildebeest from behind			2
initially , the horned animal manages to keep the three predators at bay , but after a couple of minutes the wildebeest is overpowered and the cubs catch their first prey			1
the amazing images were captured by photographer @entity42 in @entity20 's @entity43			1
at first the wildebeest appears to be holding its own and looks as though he might escape from the clutches of the lioness and her young but he eventually becomes overpowered by the three big cats who jump on his back and attempted to drag the wildebeest to the ground the stunning pictures taken in @entity20 were snapped by photographer @entity42 , who said the whole experience just lasted minutes mr @entity42 from @entity55 , @entity56 said : ' it was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride			1
