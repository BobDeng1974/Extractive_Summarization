two teenagers had to be rescued by firefighters on saturday after the chuck of ice they 'd foolishly stepped onto broke away from the shore and started floating out into @entity5			1
the males , ages 17 and 18 , were roughly 40 yards into the lake when the @entity9 arrived to rescue them just after 12:40 p.m. , reports @entity11			2
three divers in scuba gear from the department had to swim out to rescue the pair			1
they then put a ladder down for the two to climb back to safety			1
neither teenager was injured , reports @entity33			0
the incident took place at the beach behind @entity37			1
frequent visitors to the lake say it is currently difficult to tell where the beach ends and the ice begins			1
the incident is the second strange ice rescue this week - on thursday a @entity45 @entity24 ship was cutting ice on frozen - over @entity47 when they came across a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures			1
when crew members brought the curious 25 - year - old man on board , he said he was trying to walk from @entity55 to @entity56			0
@entity55 lies on the southwestern shore of @entity47 , and the unidentified ice - walker was found just half a mile from @entity59 on the opposite shore			2
from there it 's a 201 - mile journey on land to reach @entity56			0
@entity66 coats @entity64 surrounded by ice - covered @entity5 in @entity67			1
for the second consecutive winter , bitter weather threatens to turn the surface of the @entity71 into a vast frozen plain for the second consecutive winter , bitter weather has threatened to turn the surface of the @entity71 into a vast , frozen plain			0
during february there were days when as much as 85 percent of the lakes ' surface area was covered with ice , the @entity75 @entity74 has reported			2
records show the lakes ' most widespread freeze was 94.7 percent in 1979			0
the ice cover topped out at 92.2 percent last march			2
significant portions of the lakes typically froze over decades ago , @entity86 said , but the frequency of severe winters has declined since the late 1990s			0
' two almost record - setting years back to back would be very unusual , ' he said			2
one likely explanation for the rapid buildup this month is that 2014 's freeze lasted so long — @entity92 was n't completely ice - free until june — and summer was so mild that the lakes did n't absorb much heat , he said			1
' so we started this season with below - water temperatures to begin with			2
' rescued : the @entity24 rescued a man on thursday morning , who they found walking alone on the middle of frozen - over @entity47 the ice blanket reaches across more than 90 percent of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , while @entity104 and @entity105 are more than halfway covered			0
it has produced some spectacular visual images , from ice caves along the @entity5 shoreline to a glacial buildup making it appear that @entity111 had frozen in place			1
but it 's a headache for the @entity24 , whose cutters open channels for vessels hauling vital cargo such as heating oil and road salt			0
the @entity55 - based tug @entity122 has struggled for days to free the @entity123 , a freighter stranded about 70 miles east of @entity125 in ice up to 10 feet thick			1
the @entity127 has dispatched an icebreaker to assist			0
the job has taken so much longer than expected that the @entity122 's crew ran low on food and had to receive a delivery by helicopter , which lowered supplies in their rescue basket			0
things will get even busier in mid-march , when the shipping season begins for the lakes ' regular traffic of vessels carrying iron ore , coal , grain and other bulk cargo			0
' we 're probably going to be looking at situations like we had last year , where we had to put together convoys — lots of vessels together to make it through , ' @entity145 spokesman @entity145 said			0

the firefighter helped pushed the piece of ice back to shire and then put a ladder down for the two to climb back to safety
