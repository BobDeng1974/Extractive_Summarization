by @entity0 babies are known for putting anything and everything in their mouths , from @entity6 to crayons			1
but a study suggests that this is n't necessarily a misbehaving habit , but rather a brain mechanism wired from birth			2
research performed by the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , points to a ' survival of the fittest ' mentality that ensures the baby survives even when other sensors have n't developed			1
researchers suggest that a baby 's habit of putting things in its mouth is a cognitive ability learned in the womb a drug known as @entity28 , used to improve memory function in @entity31 's patients , has found another use as a brain stimulant for adults			1
researchers at @entity36 found that the drug can revert adult brains to the quick - learning phase of children 's brains			0
it increases the elasticity of the brain , making it capable of learning rapidly in these ' critical periods '			0
the drug was used to successfully rewire a visually impaired patient 's brain to process images			0
to investigate this human trait , director of neuropsychology @entity50 and her team studied 26 patients who were undergoing brain surgery			1
while unconscious , they were able to make nine of the patients move their hands to their mouths by stimulating regions of the brain known to perform these actions			1
the fact that this behaviour is programmed into the same region of the brain in every person suggests that it is most likely an ability present in our brains before birth			2
if it was a learned skill , different regions of the brain would be involved in performing the action and it would change between individuals , but this was not the case			2
by stimulating sections of the brain , the researchers were able to make nine of 26 brain surgery patients unconsciously move their hands to their mouths , suggesting such a movement is wired into our brains this suggests that our motion of moving our hands to our mouths , perhaps to consistently supply us with food from a young age , is something that is wired into the circuitry of the brain			1
even when in the womb , foetuses are known to suck their thumbs , a precursor action to actually putting food into their mouths			0
' if you 've ever looked at a newborn primate 's brain or a baby 's brain , it 's surprising that they work at all , ' @entity102 , a neuroscientist at @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity101 told @entity112			0
' the neurons are n't mature and the consistency of the brain is sort of like pudding			0
' but some things have to work right away			0

babies have a habit of *picking* things up and putting them in their mouths
research by the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 says this is an ability learned from birth
*findings* made by stimulating brains of *people* undergoing brain surgery
the scientists were able to make nine out of 26 patients unconsciously move their hand to their mouth
