eight months after falling foul of @entity4 's @entity3 rules , @entity0 are flexing their financial muscles once again with a £ 30million move for @entity8 striker @entity7			1
in footballing terms , it 's a no - brainer			0
@entity11 has to fight for trophies on three fronts – @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 – but currently has only one available forward , @entity17 , with @entity18 and @entity19 injured , and six others including @entity21 out on loan			1
but getting the figures to stack up if @entity7 comes in on £ 200,000 - a - week will be harder			1
city want success on the pitch of course but at the same time dare n't upset the authorities again by spending beyond the means allowed by the governing body			0
@entity8 striker @entity7 is in talks with @entity0 ahead of a possible £ 30million move @entity7 's potential arrival at @entity8 would have implications on their reduced @entity14 squad if @entity7 comes in , someone like @entity38 will have to be sacrificed from @entity8 's reduced @entity14 squad			1
the club are only allowed to name 21 players for @entity42 as a @entity4 sanction and @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 need to be included to meet the quota on association - trained players			0
given that goalkeeper @entity54 is also required as back - up for @entity44 , @entity7 's inclusion in @entity8 's next @entity42 squad would mean one of their overseas big - hitters missing out			1
you would assume @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity18 are automatic selections , so one of the following would miss out : @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity17 , @entity38 , @entity68 , @entity19 , @entity69 or @entity70			0
in addition , someone else may have to be sold to help balance the books with the club keen to cash in on @entity75 or @entity76 if they can be persuaded			0
@entity38 ( left ) and @entity17 are two players who could make way in @entity42 for @entity7 someone may also have to accept a smaller pay packet in the next round of contract negotiations to help pay for @entity7 's wages			1
@entity48 , @entity65 , @entity83 and @entity84 all have deals that expire in the summer			0
a brief recap is needed			0
financial fair play regulations were introduced by @entity4 to stop the boom - and - bust mentality that threatened to destroy clubs across @entity42 , with @entity90 and @entity91 the best examples in @entity93 of ownership gone wrong			0
the initial spending spree at @entity8 following the 2008 takeover from the @entity98 ruling family saw the club run up annual losses , rising to £ 195m in 2011 alone			1
of course @entity101 could personally afford it but @entity4 said they wanted to avoid any situation where a club 's future was put at risk by an owner over-spending and then withdrawing support			0
in may , @entity8 accepted their punishment for breaking @entity3 rules			1
they were hit with a conditional £ 49m fine , a limit of £ 49m net spending in the summer transfer window , a reduced @entity14 squad from 25 to 21 and had to agree to cap spending on wages in 2015 and limit overall losses to £ 7.8m			2
@entity8 midfielder @entity48 ( right ) may have to sign a new contract on reduced terms if @entity7 joins the club it should be pointed out they were n't the only club who broke @entity3 rules			1
@entity127 - owned @entity126 were in the same boat and @entity4 are also investigating a number of other clubs			0
the sanctions affected @entity11 's plans for the season			0
he could n't afford to be in the market for @entity135 or @entity136 who both ended up at @entity137 and £ 16m @entity21 was sent on loan to @entity139 because there was n't room for him in the @entity14 squad			2
' it all starts from the restrictions due to the money we spent , ' said the city manager at the time , though @entity21 was happy to return to @entity149 as well			0
the repercussions became clear when leading scorer @entity18 suffered a knee injury at the start of december and joined @entity17 and @entity19 on the treatment table			0
although @entity8 have continued to win games with @entity48 up front and @entity18 is expected to return against @entity156 on saturday , @entity11 has realised his squad is too light with defining matches against @entity159 and @entity160 coming up – hence the interest in @entity7 , an @entity162 powerhouse who is already proven in @entity93 football			1
@entity21 ( left ) joined @entity139 on loan as @entity8 could n't include him in their @entity14 squad for their part , @entity8 are reluctant to explain at this stage how they are going to sign @entity7 and stay within @entity3 rules – understandable as the deal to sign the 26 - year - old is still ongoing			1
if and when it is completed , they will be asked again			0
even moving for @entity7 is a sign of their growing confidence that they have the spending - revenue ratio under control as demanded by @entity4			2
their latest set of financial figures in december saw annual losses reduced to £ 7m after the fine to @entity4 had been taken into account			2
the main reason is the increased revenue the @entity15 champions are now bringing in			2
their turnover is at an all - time high £ 346.5m , with plenty of sponsorship deals in place with companies from @entity190 and elsewhere			2
@entity7 will be an eye - catching signing for @entity8 , both on and off the field			1
@entity7 ( right ) scored more @entity15 goals - 20 - than anyone else during the last calendar year			1

@entity0 are in talks with @entity8 over *buying* @entity7
@entity7 scored more @entity15 goals than anyone else in 2014
the @entity162 *international* will cost @entity8 around £ 30m
@entity0 travel to @entity156 in the @entity15 on saturday
