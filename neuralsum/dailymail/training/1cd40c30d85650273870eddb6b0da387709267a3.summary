at an inquest in @entity58 , @entity27 , a statement was read from her mother @entity59 , who was unable to fly over from @entity4			1
she said dr @entity35 never did things by halves , but wanted to come back to @entity4 due to struggles with work and the recent death of her grandfather in the country			1
mrs @entity8 added : ‘ she was passionate about science			1
when she got the job in @entity71 she was so anxious about moving from a small city to a large city on the other side of the world			2
but she was very outgoing and friendly and expecting to make new friends			2
‘ she managed her depression by always having a hobby outside of study			2
some family friends knew about her struggles but others did n’t			2
she had a great sense of humour and fun			2
’ despite protestations from her family , dr @entity35 chose to live alone in @entity71 and after her grandfather died in november last year , would regularly tell her mother over phone or @entity90 that she was suffering badly from depression			2
she had tried to hang herself on january 5 , but failed			1
she then continued to work the following week without mentioning to colleagues the personal turmoil she was enduring and appeared to be ‘ very friendly , lively and bubbly ’ when they went out for a drink			2
change : the 25 - year - old moved from @entity41 ( left ) in @entity4 to @entity22 ( right ) in @entity27 mrs @entity8 said : ‘ she was alone at @entity100 , she seemed a bit low			1
on january 6 she called me to say she had tried to hang herself the night before			2
i did n’t realise how quickly she could go to that			2
‘ she said she was feeling the worse she had ever felt			2
’ she saw a psychiatrist after contacting her mother and was prescribed anti-depressants which seemed to be working			2
mrs @entity8 said : ‘ she found high failure rates in experimental work difficult to deal with			1
she then got offered work outside the lab. ‘ on saturday evening she was down again and wanting to come home			0
i was surprised by her rapid switch and told her not to rush decisions			0
the offer of different work seemed like a good start			0
’ ' she called me to say she had tried to hang herself the night before			0
i did n’t realise how quickly she could go to that ' @entity59 , mother mrs @entity8 offered to call her daughter on saturday night , @entity4 time , but she declined , saying a mental health crisis team were paying her a visit in the morning			1
after calling and texting her daughter the following day with no response , mrs @entity8 called @entity24 suspecting the worse , and an officer discovered her body that night on january 11			1

’ healthcare support worker @entity123 , who was helping counsel dr @entity35 after her failed suicide attempt , visited her apartment on the day of her death			1
miss @entity123 said : ‘ she was very warm and pleasant			0
she invited me in and asked me to sit down			0
she said she had plans for the evening to watch some tv and so some knitting			0
‘ she was saying the next day she might start going to the gym			0
there was no change from when i saw her the day before			0
we fixed a meeting for her to see my colleague the following afternoon			0
’ science : dr @entity35 had been due to start a new project management role in her research group at the @entity10 ( pictured ) just two days after her death recording a narrative verdict , @entity140 coroner @entity139 said : ‘ she was a very well - educated , intelligent woman and appears to have been a very outgoing person with friends			1
‘ from the evidence i have heard , even though it may have been different in her mind she appears to have been working very well and was successful within the research team			1
‘ i accept that she was uncertain about her future in chemistry and she was a little disillusioned with regard to her chosen discipline and also the fact of her involvement with a research team within that discipline			1
' i find her death to be an enormous tragedy			0
a young , talented , intelligent , vibrant young lady who came to @entity71 from @entity4 believing she was going to further her education by contributing in terms of research to projects that might benefit others ' @entity139 , @entity164 ‘ she would go out for a drink and when she was out she was vibrant and someone who was part of the social gathering but more than that very alive in the way she enjoyed herself			1
‘ her colleagues thought something was not quite right but were not aware of her previous medical history			0
she had a previous history of diagnosed depression			0
‘ she did n’t talk about depression to her work colleagues or those she socialised with			0
she did n’t warn anybody about what she was about to do and there was no contact with her mother which is significant in my mind			0
‘ the attempt on the 5th was a spontaneous act at night when she was on her own			0
that is not dissimilar to what happened on the 11th			0
in these lonely times and lonely occasions at night the depression would be a factor that is important			0
‘ i find her death to be an enormous tragedy			0
a young , talented , intelligent , vibrant young lady who came to @entity71 from @entity4 believing she was going to further her education by contributing in terms of research to projects that might benefit others			1
‘ for her to die in these circumstances in an apartment in @entity22 is something that would have been beyond the imagination of her family in @entity4			1
it is a tragedy of utmost proportion			0
i am greatly saddened by the loss of such talent			0
