an overwhelming majority of @entity3 voters hope @entity4 will remain part of the @entity6 , a poll reveals today			1
but they say that regardless of the referendum result , @entity4 mps at @entity9 should be stripped of the right to vote on issues which have been devolved to @entity13			2
and if @entity4 does vote for independence next thursday , a clear majority of @entity3 people believe they should not be allowed to keep the pound – a slap in the face for @entity21 leader @entity20			1
the finding contradicts suggestions that most @entity3 voters would be only too happy to wave goodbye to @entity4			1
the poll also shows that many @entity3 voters are unhappy that the future of the @entity6 has been left entirely to the @entity4			1
fifty - six per cent believe voters in @entity27 , @entity36 and @entity37 should have been given a say in such a fundamental decision			1
but the survey also reveals growing @entity3 resentment at the raw deal @entity27 gets from the current devolution arrangements			2
almost two - thirds said @entity4 mps at @entity9 should be barred from voting on devolved issues that no longer affect their constituents			0
such a move would prevent @entity4 ’s mps voting on a wide range of issues , including health , education , transport , criminal justice and local government			0
but , if plans to hand the @entity4 parliament powers over tax and welfare go ahead , @entity4 mps could also be barred from voting on the @entity61 – potentially jeopardising the chances of a future @entity64 government enacting its main policies			0
first minister of scotland @entity20 last week celebrated when a shock poll claimed 51 per cent of @entity4 voters had sided with the @entity70 campaign			2
the @entity72 crusade has since taken over again in some polls the move was floated by the conservatives in opposition and is now being considered seriously again by senior @entity77			0
the poll suggests broad support for giving @entity4 more powers if it remains in the @entity6 , with 48 per cent supporting the idea and 26 per cent opposed			0
but it deals a major blow to mr @entity20 ’s demand that an independent @entity4 should be allowed to continue to use the pound as part of a currency union with the rest of the @entity6			2
barely a quarter ( 26 per cent ) of @entity3 voters support the move , with 53 per cent saying an independent @entity4 should not be allowed to keep the pound			1
@entity92 urged voters in @entity94 to sway towards the no campaign while @entity97 leader @entity96 visited voters in @entity99 in a last - ditch attempt to save the union this week all three main parties at @entity9 have ruled out a currency union with an independent @entity4 , as has the governor of the @entity105 , @entity104			1
mr @entity20 insists that a deal is possible , but today ’s poll suggests that any attempt would be firmly rejected by @entity3 voters			0
this would leave @entity4 forced to set up its own currency , join the euro , or continue to use the pound without the backing of the @entity105			0
the last of these options would leave it unable to set interest rates or limit borrowing , and would remove protection for its banks			0
the overwhelming majority of @entity3 voters also believe @entity4 should be forced to take its share of the @entity6 national debt if it does go independent			1
with just six days until the historic referendum , the poll reveals most @entity3 voters want the @entity4 to remain part of the @entity6 despite claims by the @entity70 campaign that the country would be better off separated the poll is revealed after contrasting reports found different campaigns to be in the lead with less than a week until the referendum only 4 per cent believe the @entity4 should be let off the hook , with 83 per cent saying @entity4 should be forced to pay its way			1
but there was better news for mr @entity20 on the monarchy , with 40 per cent of people in @entity27 happy for the @entity140 to remain as @entity4 ’s head of state , and only 26 per cent opposed			2
the queen is thought to be alarmed and saddened by the prospect of the break - up of the @entity6			0
but the majority of voters ( 51 per cent ) believe she should resist calls to intervene in the debate , with 29 per cent saying she should speak out .			0

survey reveals 70 per cent want @entity4 to stay part of the union
fifty - six per cent said @entity3 , @entity36 and @entity37 voters should also have a say in historic referendum
twenty per cent of those asked were happy for @entity4 to break away
