at @entity3 in @entity4 , he hung his head in shame as he was jailed for eight months after admitting three charges of fraud and nine offences under consumer protection regulations			1
judge @entity50 told @entity16 : ‘ it ’s very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court			0
you had , prior to these events , led a blameless life			0
yet you conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age , illness or bereavement			0
trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour			0
’ earlier the court heard how @entity16 ’s firm was already sliding into bankruptcy when he targeted elderly people who did not want to burden surviving relatives with their funeral costs			1
four victims including an elderly couple aged 86 and 92 agreed to pay between £ 2,300 to £ 3,000 each for funeral plans not realising they were worthless as they were not backed by any insurance			1
they were also unaware @entity16 was not regulated by the @entity75 due to his financial difficulties			0
intended recipient : between september and december 2013 at least £ 800 was donated to the @entity30 in memory of two men who died			1
none of the donations were ever received it meant families did n’t realise they would lose their money once @entity16 ’s business went bankrupt in january 2013 , meaning no funds were available for customers seeking refunds			2
one widower who took out a £ 3,019 plan with @entity16 after his wife died , tried to get a refund after getting a deal with @entity94 - only to get nothing			1
another family paid out almost £ 5,000 to @entity16 including £ 1,080 for a headstone in memory of a retired builder who died aged 64 of cancer			1
the funeral went ahead but no headstone materialised			1
@entity16 was called in by police for interview but said he could not attend because he was in hospital			0

during inquiries police discovered between june 2010 and february 2013 @entity16 had received donations totalling £ 945 intended for @entity29			1
in february 2011 he had received £ 190 worth of donations for @entity120 in memory of a local lady who died			2
and between september and december 2013 at least £ 800 was donated to the @entity30 in memory of two men who died			2
none of the donations were ever received			2
prosecutor miss @entity125 said : ‘ these persons were vulnerable , through age , infirmity or bereavement			0
in addition the victims have suffered stress and anxiety			0
‘ in selling the funeral plans , the defendant falsely advised them that there would be insurance to back them up			1
in fact none of the plans had security and were effectively worthless			2
kept the money : in february 2011 he had received £ 190 worth of donations for @entity120 ( pictured ) in memory of a local lady who died ‘ he took money from plans when he knew his business was in difficulty and been made bankrupt			1
in 2005 his father and business partner had died and the defendant ran into financial difficulty			0
‘ in 2011 he had difficulties with various loans and credit cards			0
since the death of his father he was incapable of keeping up the finances , robbing @entity161 to pay @entity162 and to meet his financial commitments			0

' you conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age , illness or bereavement			0
trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour ' judge @entity50 the court heard @entity16 always provided a funeral but the money he received for the plans went into propping up his business and not into the holding accounts of customers			2
in mitigation for @entity16 , defence @entity191 said : ‘ he has never been in trouble previously and was considered a pillar of the community - both him and his father before him			2
he provided funerals as affordable as possible			0
‘ he would have done everything in his power to provide funerals for the people in this case			0
‘ he had always intended to pay these cash sums across to the various charities			1
he instead used them to pay for the day to day running , for the funerals he was contracted for			0
‘ his financial situation has been disastrous for many years			2
he would say he is a very good undertaker and a very bad business man			0
’ but after the case @entity212 , 39 , who was never provided with a headstone for her late father @entity214 , 64 , said : ‘ we trusted him completely			2
seeing this man jailed is justice for my dad			0
he would have been fuming			0
