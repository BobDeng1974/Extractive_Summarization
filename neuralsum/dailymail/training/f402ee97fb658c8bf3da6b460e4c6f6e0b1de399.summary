no feminist : today 's feminism is utterly irrelevant to @entity2 when @entity5 's @entity4 asked me during a debate on the programme this week whether i was a feminist , i hoped my blow - dried hair and figure - hugging dress would give her some clue as to the answer			1
feeling a little mischievous , i was tempted to ask her whether i looked like one of those grumpy women in bad clothes who spend their days in a state of agitation about whether it 's right to let girls play with dolls			2
but since i was a guest on the @entity22 's flagship news programme , i decided to park the sarcasm and simply say that i am not : that today 's feminism is utterly irrelevant to me			1
i explained to @entity4 and my fellow panellists , professor @entity25 and @entity26 , that feminism has betrayed its roots and deteriorated into spurious artificial engineering			2
rather than campaigning to help women , feminists today are more likely to be picking fights on @entity33 , or dressing up petty grievances as proof of rampant ' sexism '			1
and , needless to say , these devotees of ' equality ' believe you ca n't be a feminist unless you 're left - wing			2
spoiling for a fight is the default position of today 's chippy feminists			1
they 've turned nit - picking into an art form - and i told @entity4 as much			0
no sooner had i said this than i 'd elicited the ire of what i call the ' hash - tag sisters ' - those liberal commentators on @entity33 who rushed to attack me for my unfashionable conviction that feminism has lost its meaning			1
i was accused of espousing views which are ' poisonous to society ' , and called ' sad ' , ' ignorant ' and ' stupid '			0
someone bitterly declared i must have enjoyed a ' charmed life ' - a lazy generalisation by a socialist grudge - bearer who assumes my convictions have been created from a position of privilege			0
in fact , my parents were of modest means and could n't afford private school , but i won a scholarship to attend one			0
at my all - girls ' school no one sought out trite examples of discrimination			0
we were urged to aim high and fulfil our potential			0
that , after all , is what the @entity77 did - one of whom was an alumna of my school			0
@entity81 : rather than campaigning to help women , feminist today are more likely to be picking fights on @entity33 some 100 years after @entity84 threw herself under a horse in the name of equality , is n't it perverse that those who would wish to subjugate me are the firebrand feminists who pit sister against sister , denying my view credence ? how ironic , i thought , as i scrolled through my @entity33 feed , that those who claim to champion women want to bully me for saying i do n't believe in a cause they have bastardised			1
as a university - educated woman who combines a fulfilling career as a journalist and broadcaster with my role as a homemaker for my husband and four children , i have better things to do than spend my days mirthlessly lamenting the lot of women , which is what most feminists seem to do			1
indeed , what the sour @entity113 wo n't admit is that all the great battles on which feminism was founded have been won - including political representation , and equality in education , the workplace and other areas of public life			2
what 's left is an ugly vacuum occupied by those who will only let you join the sisterhood if you agree to pander to a petty hunt for signs of oppression			0
look no further than the campaign by @entity132 , who railed against the @entity134 for the lack of women on our bank notes , citing this as evidence of discrimination			2
spectacularly pointless , surely ? an emancipated , financially independent woman could n't care less whether @entity143 is emblazoned on a tenner			0
i do n't : i just care that i 'm being paid enough of them			0
' what the sour @entity113 wo n't admit is that all the great battles on which feminism was founded have been won ' when i went out to splash some of my hard - earned cash on a beautiful new dress this week , i did n't take a blind bit of notice of the images on the notes i was spending			2
yet today 's misguided women 's libbers scrabble around in search of reasons to validate their existence			1
when it was announced that the @entity160 would be known henceforth as the @entity160 , acknowledging sponsorship by the liqueur , one sour feminist took to the internet to proclaim that it was ' a reflection of the depressing girlification of culture [ as ] @entity168 is a sweet , sticky drink explicitly marketed at women			0
' tell that to my husband , who loves it over ice			0
today 's feminists appear to be living behind a smoke screen of their own construction , blind to the reality of female achievement in the 21st century , when girls outperform boys at @entity182 and in further education			1
around 20 per cent more girls make it to university than boys			0
today 's so - called sisters also refuse to accept that women are wired differently to men - that many see becoming a mother as the crowning achievement of their lives			1
who can argue with the female executive who , after delivering her newborn , decides to give up the office and stay at home ? i think today 's glass ceiling is largely self - imposed , perhaps the result of many deciding to leave full - time employment to put family life first			1
the sisterhood today : contemporary feminists would loathe the fact that @entity2 lets her daughter play with dolls one survey found that women who own businesses earn nearly 17 per cent more than men in the same position			1
that 's my definition of feminism - not some spurious insistence on female quotas and women - only shortlists			1
how does that square with sisters doing it for themselves ? if i ever was a feminist , i ca n't be now - not according to those who loathe the fact i see marriage as more than a piece of paper , that i believe women have no place in a combat zone , and that i know my daughter wo n't be stereotyped for playing with dolls			1
i will be disqualified from the ' sisterhood ' , too , by my hope that as well as having a career , she will meet a man who will love and treasure her			0
the final irony is that feminism has brought out a touch of the misogynist in me , so ashamed and depressed am i by a once - laudable movement which has corrupted its heritage and condemns me for saying so			2
for that , i think any sensible woman will join me in feeling saddened by how irrelevant and niche modern feminism has become .			0

@entity251 argues that feminism has lost its meaning
rather than campaign to help women , feminists today *squabble* on @entity33
as seen by the hash - tag sisters 's response to her @entity5 *interview*
