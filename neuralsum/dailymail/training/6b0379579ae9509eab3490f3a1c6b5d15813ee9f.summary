by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 and @entity4 's attempts at maintaining a friendly rivalry are well and truly over after the @entity7 's controversial victory at the @entity8 resulted in a podium ceremony laced with barely - disguised contempt			1
@entity2 believes @entity4 was guilty of underhand tactis in order to beat him in @entity13 , but if so he is only following in the footsteps of many of @entity17 's all - time legends			1
but as the pair 's boss at @entity20 - the great @entity18 , no less - said : ‘ you have to be a b * * * * * * if you want to win in @entity17			1
' here , we remember @entity17 's ultimate b * * * * * * * ( who also happen to be hugely successful )			1
just look at his face : @entity2 ( left ) was clearly furious at @entity4 ( centre ) in @entity13 @entity29 @entity17 ’s ultimate anti-hero , with his thin - lipped smile			1
the most significant black marks against his reputation were his crashes with title rivals @entity36 and @entity38 in the deciding races of the 1994 and 1997 seasons			0
but perhaps his lowest act of skulduggery was parking on the racing line at @entity44 to deny @entity46 pole position at @entity8 in 2006			1
he had ice in his veins , never more so that putting the car on pole at @entity51 in the spring of 2003			2
he went back to see his seriously ill mother @entity52 that evening in @entity7 and returned back to race			0
by the time he started , she had died – but he still won			0
always controversial : @entity29 reacts before and after qualifying in @entity8 in 2006 underhand : @entity29 and @entity36 crash in @entity56 in 1994 as the @entity7 sealed his first world title @entity58 for sheer rudeness nobody , surely , can match @entity58			1
he called @entity60 , his 1986 and 1987 @entity61 team - mate , ‘ an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife			0
’ he dismissed @entity64 as ‘ senile ’ and asked whether he or @entity66 ( whom he had previously insinuated was gay ) was a better driver , replied : ‘ i ’m still alive			1
’ rude and crafty : @entity58 ( right ) , with @entity61 and @entity60 at @entity69 in 1986 he could also be crafty			0
he kept secret from @entity60 the fact he was using a new differential , which helped him win the @entity73			0
years later , he was involved in disclosing @entity75 ’s part in @entity76 – the fixed race in @entity78 – involving his son @entity79 , who hardly lacked confidence himself			2
@entity46 @entity46 is synonymous with ruthlessness in modern @entity17			1
the ‘ most complete driver ’ is a kinder way of putting it			0
even in his championship - winning years at @entity75 he was tetchy if @entity86 , an ideal no 2 , was ever perceived to be given even half - favourable treatment			0
this trait continued at @entity90 , where he joined the rookie @entity2			1
there must be some sympathy for @entity46 , for @entity2 was a product of the team ’s development programme and the darling of the sport			1
but there was no excuse for snitching to the @entity102 about @entity90 ’s role in @entity104 because he was denied outright no 1 status			0
and what about @entity76 , the @entity78 race he won after his team - mate @entity109 crashed ? he knew nothing about the team orders ... or so he said			2
' crashgate ' : @entity109 deliberately wrecked his @entity75 under team orders in @entity78 in 2008 butter would n't melt : @entity46 ( centre ) was the chief beneficiary , winning the race after a safety car @entity18 the rat - featured @entity117 was a clever and meticulous driver			1
he said of his relations with @entity122 at @entity90 : ‘ i hated the guy			0
he ’s a difficult character			0
' let ’s put it that way			0
when he started to blow me off all the time in practice , because he was better at handling this 1200hp thing than i was , i changed my strategy			0
but i never told him any more what i was doing to the car			0
if i was more clever setting up my car why should i give him the advantage of it ? ’ and who was in charge of @entity20 when they sneaked in an extra tyre test last year ? the old calculating @entity18			1
all for show : @entity18 and @entity122 appeared united on the podium at @entity144 in 1984 , but all was not well @entity146 a different kind of b * * * * * *			1
‘ @entity151 ’ was the usually debonair , sometimes boorish @entity150 icon			0
but he can not be left off the list : the sheer scale of his hedonism is too great to ignore			0
at times it was amazing that he could even drive straight such was the cocktail of excess he had taken the night before			0
sometimes he could not , and his spin at @entity69 during the @entity150 @entity8 was one such occasion			1
hash , cocaine , acid or alcohol may have had something to do with it			0
at other moments he had a queue of @entity167 stewardesses outside his door			0
he was ruthless and brave , characteristics that made him drive through the rain to win the 1976 title			0
ladies ' man : @entity146 with his first wife , @entity174 , in 1974 ( left ) and partying with @entity175 ( right ) @entity66 when @entity2 threatened to ' take a leaf out of @entity66 's book ' ahead of sunday 's race , he could have been referring to a number of incidents involving the ruthless and calculated three - times world champion			1
indeed , for all his brilliance behind the wheel of a @entity17 car , @entity66 could be quite callous in the cockpit , displaying a win - at - all - costs mentality which the sport had never seen before			1
the most damning came at @entity188 in 1990 when @entity66 , aggrieved with starting from pole on the dirty side of the track , rammed his great rival @entity122 off at the very first corner in order to win the title			1
@entity66 explaining away his behaviour replied simply : ' i am @entity66 '			2
ruthless : @entity66 takes out @entity122 at the @entity198 @entity8 in 1990 to clinch the world championship @entity2 there is an air of entitlement to @entity2			1
that was clear in the concocted evidence he gave to the stewards in @entity207 in the incident known as ' @entity209 ' , even if the team told him what lines to say			0
but his most gross act of bad behaviour was tweeting confidential @entity90 telemetry			0
a firmer boss than @entity217 would have severely reprimanded him or even sacked him			0
as well as this , he complained bitterly about @entity90 's strategy at @entity8 in 2007 , his rookie year , saying : ' i 'm not a no 2			1
' fast forward seven years and we learned that he ignored team orders not to put on the overtaking mode during the closing stages of the @entity227 @entity8 earlier this month			2
painted smiles : @entity46 and @entity2 were team - mates at @entity90 in 2007 but soon fell out @entity231 the @entity7 became a pantomime villain last season after he was jeered and taunted en route to his record - breaking fourth consecutive title			1
the ill - feeling surrounded his conduct at the @entity237 @entity8 - a race in which he ruthlessly ignored an order from his team - that of ' @entity241 ' - to hold station behind @entity243			2
despite the outpouring of negativity towards him , @entity231 said he would be prepared to ignore team orders again : ' i 'm not sure i can give a proper answer because in the moment it might be different but i would probably do the same			2
' civil war : @entity231 ( left ) did n't play fair with former @entity252 team - mate @entity243 ( right ) @entity4 the more cerebral type of b * * * * * * ? with his @entity257 iciness , five languages and engineering background , he is the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap. the only problem with his inclusion is that we do n't know for sure that he meant deliberately to disrupt @entity270 's flying lap at @entity8 last weekend			1
if it was planned , it was the perfect crime , for the stewards cleared him and he drove on to win			0
either way , he is working hard to find an engineering edge over @entity2			2
that is ruffling @entity2 ; @entity4 is unperturbed			1
did he mean it ? @entity4 took pole position in @entity8 last weekend after a controversial aborted lap @entity122 the pint - sized professor had sights on winning world titles , not friends			1
paranoid with fear that his own @entity90 team were conspiring against him to win the 1989 title , he appeared to cause a deliberate collision with rival @entity66 at the decisive race in @entity198			2
@entity122 jumped out of his car only to watch @entity66 win the race and the championship			2
@entity122 paid a visit to see his countryman , ally and @entity102 president @entity299 and @entity66 was later stripped of the victory , a loophole in the regulations deemed @entity66 had re-joined the track illegally			2
@entity122 was subsequently crowned champion			0
arch rivals : @entity122 ( left ) in a typically frosty moment with @entity90 team mate @entity66 ( right ) in 1988			2

@entity2 and @entity4 *battle* is latest in long line of @entity17 feuds
@entity2 believes @entity4 deliberately crashed at @entity8 qualifying in bid to *scupper* his bid for pole position
@entity18 , the pair 's boss at @entity20 , said that ' b * * * * * * * ' succeed in @entity17
@entity66 , @entity29 , @entity231 and more have all been involved in controversy in past
