smoke alarm - sized sensors installed in classrooms , hallways and other points throughout the building were activated by the sounds of gunfire , and police officers were immediately able to track his movements and quickly subdue him			1
police chief @entity48 said he believes such systems should be required in many public buildings , just as fire suppression systems and smoke detectors are			1
' it 's amazing , the short , split - second amount of time from identification of the shot to transmission of the message , ' he said following the demonstration			2
' it changes the whole game			0

mr @entity102 said his company 's technology is based on systems successfully developed for the military to help soldiers locate enemy fire during battles and could cost anywhere from $ 20,000 to $ 100,000 , depending on the size and structure of the building			2
