@entity8 hits back at women who accuse him of sexual harassment
@entity228 and @entity11 say he asked for a threesome
but former boss mr @entity8 says they are making up the claims to cash in
mr @entity8 said he would not have done this because he suffers from ' erection dysfunction ' and has n't ' felt like a man ' for 12 years
he says the two women live *undesirable* ' street-wise ' *lifestyles*
ms @entity10 cries when she 's accused of making up the claims
she *insists* she has been treated unfairly and only wants ' justice '
she says other men at the company are ' *cowards* ' for not protecting her
