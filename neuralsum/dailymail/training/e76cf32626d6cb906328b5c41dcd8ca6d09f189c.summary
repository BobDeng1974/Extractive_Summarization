by @entity0 published : 03:25 est , 10 april 2012 updated : 04:11 est , 10 april 2012 board brothers : princes @entity2 and @entity3 set a @entity4 first when they went surfing in @entity5 , @entity6 , of all places , in 1890 one 's a tropical paradise in the @entity9 with long , hot summers , crystal blue waters - and high - rolling waves			1
the other is rather more chilly and somewhat lacking in the ' crystal blue ' department			0
but that did n't stop two 19th - century @entity18 princes taking to the @entity19 off the coast of @entity5 , @entity6 , in what is believed to be the first instance of surfing in @entity4			1
a long - lost letter , published for the first time , reveals the two young royals and their @entity27 guardian went surfing at the resort in september 1890			1
the document , possibly the earliest report of the sport in @entity4 , was uncovered after research into @entity34 surfers			1
pictures of the trio and details of their escapade - which stunned locals - have gone on display at @entity42 ’s only dedicated surfing museum , in @entity43 , @entity44			1
museum founder @entity45 has now called for a statue of the princes to thank them for bringing surfing to @entity4			1
he said : ' this is the most wonderful discovery and a massive revelation in terms of @entity4 surfing heritage			1
' the fact that not only do we now know that @entity18 royalty surfed while being educated in @entity27 in the late 1800s , but also that they chose a relatively obscure surfing destination like @entity5 on the east coast to paddle out and catch a few slides is just fantastic			2
' this is the earliest proven instance of surfing in @entity4 so far - previously we had thought it was the 1920s in @entity27 and the @entity63 - but this blows our history right out of the water			1
' the @entity34 locals must have been incredulous at the sight of these @entity69 paddling out , and riding back into shore most likely standing on large wooden planks - their dark skin and hair glistening in the @entity19 waters			2
' i only wish i could have been there to see it			0
' blown out of the water : this picture taken in 1890 shows how @entity5 beach may have looked when the princes amazed holidaymakers with their surfing skills the letter , to @entity18 consul @entity85 from prince @entity86 , was discovered by @entity18 author and historian @entity87			1
the prince wrote that he and his brother , prince @entity90 , were allowed by their tutor - believed to be @entity92 - to holiday in @entity5			2
the pair were given the reward for good work in their studies in schools at colleges around @entity4			1
they had been in @entity27 furthering their education for almost a year			0
expert surfer : the princes ' cousin , princess @entity103 ( above ) , may have been the first female to hit the waves in @entity4 on september 22 , 1890 , a joyful @entity3 could not restrain his enthusiasm in his letter to consul @entity85			1
he said : ' we enjoy the seaside very much and are out swimming every day			0
' the weather has been very windy these few days and we like it very much for we like the sea to be rough so that we are able to have surf riding			0
' we enjoy surf riding very much and surprise the people to see us riding on the surf			0
' even @entity92 is learning surf riding and will be able to ride as well as we can in a few days more			0
he likes this very much for it is a very good sport			0
' the two @entity18 royals were no strangers to surfing in chilly waters like the @entity19			2
in 1885 , they surfed in @entity122 on 15 - foot redwood planks weighing 100lbs in similar temperature waters - making them the first to do it in @entity126			2
it is thought the @entity18 princes , the orphaned nephews and heir to @entity129 , would have made their surfboards from timber acquired from a @entity5 boat builder			2
they would have bought or hired neck - to - knee swimsuits made of cotton or wool			2
the north east coast of @entity27 is home to some world class surfing waves - but @entity5 has never been a particularly popular beach for surfers			1
the two princes were cousins of expert surfer @entity143 , the half @entity18 - half @entity144 heir to the @entity18 throne who was educated in the south coast resort of @entity148 in 1892			0
@entity87 said : ' her time in @entity27 was deliberately below the radar of the newspapers of the day			0
' she may have been the first female surfer in @entity4 , but the only tangible evidence - so far - is a letter in which she wrote that she enjoyed ‘ being on the water again ’ at @entity148			1
new generation : surfing is now extremely popular around the @entity4 , particularly in @entity157 ( above ) where major competitions are held ' she may have meant a walk on the @entity161 , or a walk on the promenade			1
@entity143 liked swimming and surfing			0
' she was a high - spirited girl , who when she returned to @entity166 , liked to sneak out past midnight to go swimming in the moonlight with girlfriends			0
' the @entity169 recently published the only known photo of the young princess in a watersports setting - seated in an outrigger canoe at @entity174			0
by coincidence the latest government - backed tv advert to encourage @entity4 to holiday at home features @entity180 star @entity179 - surfing at @entity5			1
in @entity122 a statue descendants of the @entity18 princes unveiled a plaque to commemorate their surfing ‘ first ’			0
@entity45 added : ' we would love to commission a sculpture to honour their achievement and say thank you to @entity166 for giving the world the fantastic gift of surfing			0
' the @entity169 opened in @entity43 on april 6 .			0
