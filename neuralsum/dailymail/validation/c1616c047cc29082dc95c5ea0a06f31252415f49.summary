as usual , i have high hopes for my @entity3 bouquet tomorrow			2
my three teenage children know how i adore fresh flowers and , as i never buy them for myself , my annual bunch — delivered to my bedside with a trio of shy grins and breakfast on a tray — is always a real treat			2

so , is it really possible to fake a good bouquet ? i challenged leading florist @entity75 , co-owner and creative director of @entity78 ’s @entity77 , to make up three identical pairs of @entity3 arrangements — one real , one fake — to see if i could tell the real blooms from their silk stand - ins ...			1

florists across the *country* are preparing for a rush on flowers for *sunday*
but department store @entity26 says sales of artificial flowers are soaring
those in the know say phony florals have really improved in recent years
but can a fake ever be as good as the real thing ? @entity99 puts it to the test
