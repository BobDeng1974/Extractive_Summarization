@entity6 , from @entity7 , developed a severe underbite after she was fitted with braces as a child - by 13 her jaw protruded dramatically
she was bullied and and became depressed about her appearance and would cover the lower half of her face to hide her facial ' deformity '
she eventually underwent a five - hour operation to break both jaws and fit titanium plates to *reshape* her facial *structure*
the procedure was successful and she feels more confident than ever and want to go into television presenting
