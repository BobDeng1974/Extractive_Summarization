by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 played down his newly - acquired ' big dog ' epithet on tuesday and said he was ready to curb his exuberance if he felt it could help his @entity8 team deal with what is likely to be a red - hot @entity11 atmosphere this week			1
earlier on tuesday @entity8 captain @entity12 said the big - hitting two - times @entity14 winner would probably be the man the @entity16 would most like to beat , just as his team have their crosshairs firmly fixed on @entity19			1
both players have reveled in the noisy atmosphere of the @entity11 , particularly in 2012 when they positively encouraged the crowd to keep on cheering right through their swings when they squared off in a memorable foursomes			2
@entity2 dismissed the idea that he is a ' big dog ' and said all that matters is the @entity8 team winning @entity2 is known for playing to the crowd , but he promised not to be ' goofy ' during the @entity11 @entity8 captain @entity12 , pictured here with the @entity11 on tuesday , called @entity2 a ' big dog ' despite both players missing their fairways with their opening drives , they continued to gee up the crowd all the way round the @entity41 course			1
' when you 're at home , you can do other things and be goofy , but when you 're away , you do n't want to do anything like that , even though we had some fun a couple years ago with getting the crowd revved up , ' @entity2 told reporters			1
' i 'm just here to play golf , make some putts			0
but you know , the @entity11 brings out a different audience sometimes and people that might not play golf			2
so for us it was about how you 're going to try to grow the game			0
so i thought that making it fun instead of a six - hour round would be my way of doing it			0
and so we tried to make it fun a couple years ago			2
' i 've won a few matches , lost a few matches and still have n't won a @entity11 , so obviously it has n't propelled our team to win one yet			1
' the @entity8 team are very wary of the threat posed by @entity19 , who performed heroically in the 2012 @entity11 @entity2 laughed off his captain 's ' tribute ' however , saying ' he 's making that up			1
he 's making attention come to me when it 's the other guys			0
' though @entity2 the younger might grab the attention in the same way @entity19 does , he has some way to go in matching the @entity80 's ability to harvest points			1
@entity19 is yet to win a major but finds his best form for @entity16 every two years , having won all four of his singles matches and boasts a remarkable 12 wins and three defeats from his 15 matches in four @entity87			2
@entity2 won the masters in 2012 and 2014 and will be a key man for the @entity8 at @entity90 @entity2 , a double major champion , has lost five of his eight matches , including both singles , in his two appearances in 2010 and 2012 but bears his rival no ill - will			1
' @entity19 , what he 's done in the @entity11 , obviously has grown the game , ' said the @entity8			1
' there 's been some kids out there that want to do the same thing he 's done , the way he 's come up , his background			0
i mean , what a story that is and what a great talent that is			0
his passion , his energy and his great play and his great putting			0
' @entity2 also dismissed his captain 's claim that this week represented a chance for redemption for @entity41 , when the @entity8 managed to throw away a 10 - 6 lead to lose on the final day			1
' it 's golf that motivates me , i 'm not worried about two years ago , ' he said			2
' i 've lost many a golf tournament in my day			0
i 've only won a few in my life			0
every time i get to the course , i want to beat whoever it is i 'm playing , if it 's my buddies at home or if it 's the members or if it 's at a professional golf tournament			0
' that 's really what it is about me , just trying to win that little trophy , that 's our goal			0
' i 'm not worried about what happened a few years ago			2
if i did that , i 'd be a terrible golfer because i lost a lot			0
' @entity2 played in the @entity8 's capitulation in @entity41 two years ago and is pictured here straight afterwards @entity142 's u-s - a			1

@entity8 @entity11 captain @entity12 described @entity2 as his team 's ' big dog ' on tuesday

he has never won the @entity11 but says memories of @entity41 two years ago wo n't *affect* him
the @entity8 team are wary of the threat posed by @entity19
