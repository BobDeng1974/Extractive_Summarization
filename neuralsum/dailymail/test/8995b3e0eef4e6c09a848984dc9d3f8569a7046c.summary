you may think that driving goggles belong to the days when cars were rare on the roads and people dressed in flying jackets to go for a quick drive			0
but the vintage eyewear may be set to make a comeback in a new hi - tech form , because @entity10 has produced concept smart specs to give drivers super-human powers such as x-ray - like vision			1
@entity18 ’s answer to @entity19 is designed to let drivers of its @entity10 model see pop - up virtual displays for directions and other features – and the @entity26 glasses can also be worn out of the car			1
vintage driving goggles may be set to make a comeback , because @entity10 has produced concept smart specs ( pictured ) to give drivers super-human powers in the car it calls them a ‘ revolutionary display concept offering enhanced comfort and safety ’			1
the @entity40 goggles will go on show at the @entity43 show and generate ‘ screens ’ showing information that only the wearer can see			1
for example , the goggles can project navigation information with arrows onto the roads , as well as showing speed limits and even point out local landmarks			0
@entity18 ’s answer to @entity19 is designed to let drivers of its @entity10 model see pop - up virtual displays for showing maps and other features – and the @entity26 - style glasses ( pictured ) can also be worn out of the car the goggles can project navigation information with arrows onto the roads , as well as show speed limits ( both pictured ) and even point out local landmarks driving goggles were worn by racing drivers and wealthy motorists who owned early cars , so keep bugs and flying debris out of their eyes			1
this image from 1924 shows @entity72 testing an @entity73 in @entity74 information such as speed and speed limits are shown on the heads - up display so the data is in the driver ’s primary field of view and they do n’t have to take their eyes off the road			0
navigation arrows are shown ‘ on ’ the road to show drivers the way , and local landmarks labelled too			0
an icon is shown on the smartphone - linked display when the wearer receives a text message and the message can be read out by the car			0
an x-ray view lets wearers see external objects concealed by the car , such as high kerbs and small bollards which may be an obstacle when getting out of the car			2
an ‘ @entity102 ’ feature projects images obtained from a camera on the far side mirror to the glasses to help drivers park close the curb			0
the idea is that the eyewear shows relevant information in the driver ’s direct field of vision , without obscuring other road users in a bid to boost safety			0
data such as speed , is shown just above the wheel , near to the physical dashboard they drivers would usually check without the aid of glasses			2
the goggles are connected to a smartphone so that wearers see an icon when they have a new text message , which can be read out in the car			2
users can select a mode to help them park			0
a setting called @entity102 , shows the driver the distance to the curb , by projecting images obtained from a camera on the far side mirror on the glasses			0
and the glasses also give drivers x-ray - like vision , by letting users see external objects concealed by the car			1
the feature could stop people opening their car door into low bollards and high curbs , for example			0
‘ @entity155 gives an insight into how intelligent connectivity between a @entity10 car and eyewear into which relevant content is projected might work in the future , ’ said dr @entity154 , project - manager of @entity155 , @entity18 research and technology			1
the @entity40 goggles ( pictured ) will go on show at the @entity43 show and generate ‘ screens ’ showing information that only the wearer can see the idea is that the eyewear shows relevant information in the driver ’s direct field of vision but without obscuring other road users in a bid to boost safety			1
the smart specs can be worn outside the car ( pictured ) too free parking spaces are highlighted in the driver ’s field of view so they can spot a space more easily , and a setting , called @entity102 , shows the driver the distance to the curb so that an ‘ x-ray ’ view shows them outside the car - this is illustrated above by showing a waiting dog outside the car ‘ working with several @entity194 companies , we have created an interlinked system and augmented reality eyewear with a characteristic @entity10 design that revolutionise the experience both in and outside the vehicle			1
’ @entity10 does n’t reveal much about how the goggles could be used outside the car , but shows an image of a man in art gallery , hinting that extra features could be unlocked together with using a smartphone			2
they are a prototype created by the car manufacturer and @entity209 , and there is no news about whether the goggles will ever go on sale			2
but @entity214 , vp @entity209 , said : ‘ @entity216 offers a compelling example of what ’s possible today , and what we can expect in the future			0

@entity10 made the concept @entity40 goggles with @entity194
give wearers x-ray vision when parking and pop - up data on the dashboard
@entity26 - style glasses are also designed to be worn out of the car
there *'s* no news about whether the goggles will ever go on sale
