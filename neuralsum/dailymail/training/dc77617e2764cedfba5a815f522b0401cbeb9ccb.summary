outrageous : @entity0 claims that the government was behind the @entity3 bomber that left 3 dead and more than 180 injured outrageous claims made by a professor who specializes in conspiracy theories are set to provoke grieving families by saying that the @entity10 massacre may not have happened at all			1
@entity0 , a tenured history professor at @entity11 , wrote a lengthy post on his personal blog saying that the shooting that left 20 children and six teachers dead may not have happened the way that it is widely believed , if it happened at all			1
backed solely by the erroneous early reports filed during the midst of the horrendous incident , mr @entity0 's claim is preying on the confusion of the tragic day			1
' while it sounds like an outrageous claim , one is left to inquire whether the @entity10 shooting ever took place -- at least in the way law enforcement authorities and the nation 's news media have described , ' he has said			1
the 47 - year - old professor bases his outrageous claims largely on the flurry of conflicting media reports that were made as news of the shooting was released throughout the day on december 14			1
as with many conspiracy theorists who find darker linings in even the most horrific tragedies , this is far from his first foray into the world of the unproven			0
mr @entity0 has written a number of book chapters about media coverage of wars , economic overhauls and union negotiations			1
on his blog , however , he has hit a number of the classic conspiracy theories : the september 11 attacks , the purview of the @entity52 , the @entity53 , the death of @entity55 and @entity56 have all been topics of interest			0
shut down : @entity10 is now closed , seen here on january 3 , but a professor in @entity65 argues that the shooting that took place in the school may not have happened as is conventionally believed tragic : one of the points of professor @entity0 's argument is the fact that there have been no photos of the bodies of the 20 child victims or the six teachers in his latest shocking claim , he focuses much of his attention on the fact that early reports claimed that police were either searching for or had two suspects in custody			1
the story then progressed that @entity85 was the lone gunman , based reportedly on the identification that the shooter had on him at the time of the attack			0
@entity85 , 24 , was then found at his home in @entity91 , @entity92 - two states away from his 20 - year - old brother @entity94 , the shooter			0
even though he is paid to teach a class called @entity97 which will undoubtedly produce outrageous ideas , @entity11 appears to feel that the questioning of the murder of first graders was a bridge too far			2
' @entity0 does not speak for the university			2
the website on which his post appeared is not affiliated with @entity11 in any way , ' school spokesman @entity104 said to the @entity108			2
though his ultimate end goal is unclear , he says that the end goal of the ' supposed ' shooting was political in nature			0
the moment he heard : mr @entity0 believes that there were government forces at work in the shooting at @entity10 , and theoretically then this may not be the moment president @entity118 was told predictably , his statements have sparked outrage from people across the country and not just in the still - grieving @entity124 town where much of the last three weeks has been spent picking up the pieces			1
' is there something in the water in @entity65 that makes for idiocy , ' commented @entity130 on the story by the local @entity133 affiliate @entity132			0
' how dare you suggest this was a hoax and entertain that this did n't happen , ' said a @entity108 reader with the username @entity140			0
' i 'm afraid that you do not seem to be worthy of the teaching credentials that you hold and were any of my kids students of yours , i 'd withdraw them from your roster within the @entity147 are not good at what you do and you suck as a human being			0
' political ends : he argues that the shooting was enabled in order to speed up legislation against guns instead , he is speaking plenty for himself and other believers by posting repeatedly on his blog , @entity159 , and appearing on talk radio shows to promote the theory			0
' as documents relating to the @entity10 shooting continue to be assessed and interpreted by independent researchers , there is a growing awareness that the media coverage of the massacre of 26 children and adults was intended primarily for public consumption to further larger political ends , ' he wrote			1
he argues that senator @entity173 was already in the midst of trying to rework the assault weapons ban that she co-sponsored back in the 1990s , and that the shooting gave her leverage to move it through the legislative process quicker			0
it is unclear if mr @entity0 has any vested interest in the gun control debate or if he himself owns any guns			2
calls to mr @entity0 were not immediately returned .			2

professor @entity0 asserts the shooting may have happened *differently* , if at all
@entity189 at @entity11
@entity10 has *distanced* themselves from the tenured professor
