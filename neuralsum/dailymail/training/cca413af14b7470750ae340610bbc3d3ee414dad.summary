by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 20:37 est , 3 december 2012 the @entity2 ambassador was summoned to the @entity3 yesterday for a dressing - down over his country 's settlement policy			1
@entity8 minister @entity7 told @entity9 that @entity2 will kill the prospects of a two - state solution to the peace process if it builds 3,000 homes on a tract of land called @entity16 near @entity17			1
foreign secretary @entity18 is planning talks wth @entity20 secretary of state @entity21 and @entity24 allies to get @entity2 to back down			2
building work : a @entity27 man works at a new housing development in the @entity31 @entity30 settlement near @entity17 plans : @entity2 has a master plan to build 3,600 apartments and 10 hotels on the section of territory east of @entity17 known as @entity16 worthless : @entity2 prime minister @entity38 said the vote is meaningless officials described reports that the @entity43 ambassador could be withdrawn if the scheme for 3,000 new homes in the @entity30 and @entity17 goes ahead as ' speculation '			1
however , a @entity3 spokesman made clear that they believe the @entity2 government should think again before going ahead with the plan which threatens to wreck any prospect of reviving the stalled @entity8 peace process			0
' the foreign secretary has consistently made clear that settlement building , such as the recent @entity2 government decision to build 3,000 new @entity2 housing units , threatens a two - state solution and make progress through negotiations harder to achieve , ' he said			1
' we have called on the @entity2 government to re-consider			0
we have told the @entity2 government that if they go ahead with their decision there will be a strong reaction			2
' today @entity63 summoned @entity2 's envoy in @entity65 for a meeting but played down reports it could recall its ambassador to @entity2			1
' the ambassador has been summoned in order to express our disapproval , ' foreign ministry spokesman @entity70 said			0
the @entity2 embassy also confirmed the meeting			2
' there are other ways in which we can express our disapproval , ' said the official who made it clear @entity65 was looking at other ways of putting pressure on @entity38			0
the @entity43 issued a statement saying they had made clear they would not support strong @entity2 retaliation to a @entity89 vote last week that gave the @entity27 de facto recognition of statehood			1
a diplomatic source , who declined to be named , said @entity94 would decide later in the day whether to recall its ambassador			0
such a move by both @entity94 and @entity65 would represent a severe diplomatic reproach to @entity38			0
building in the area , known as @entity16 , would sever the link between the @entity30 and east @entity17 , the sector of the holy city the @entity27 claim for a future capital , and cut off the northern part of the @entity30 form its southern flank			1
the @entity27 claim such a scenario would essentially kill any hope for the creation of a viable state			0
@entity2 's vice prime minister @entity109 told @entity110 he was not aware of any recall of a @entity43 ambassador			1
' i did not hear of this , either via the foreign ministry or the prime minister 's office			0
therefore i have a hard time believing it is true , ' he said			0

the @entity130 last week overwhelmingly endorsed an independent @entity27 state in the @entity30 , east @entity17 and the @entity132 , territories @entity2 captured in the 1967 war			1
the move to upgrade the @entity27 to a nonmember observer state does not change much on the ground , but it carries deep potential significance			0
the vote amounted to an international endorsement of the @entity27 position on future border arrangements with @entity2 and an overwhelming condemnation of @entity2 settlements in the areas claimed by the @entity27			2
@entity2 prime minister @entity38 rejects a return to @entity2 's 1967 lines			2
