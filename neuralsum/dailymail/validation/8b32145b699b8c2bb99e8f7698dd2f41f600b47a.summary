yesterday , a @entity1 war escalated between @entity2 and @entity3 after the reality star criticised his girlfriend for proposing to him			1
@entity3 launched an attack on @entity2 's partner @entity7 , saying : ' no woman should ever propose to a man , ' to which the @entity11 star responded : ' i agree ... especially when you look like ya face should be on the side of a gothic building , ' and calling her sexist			1
but a post-graduate @entity19 student who proposed to her boyfriend using a personalised pint glass tells @entity22 that @entity3 's notions of marriage are outdated			1
@entity25 , 24 , and @entity26 , 29 , who are from @entity27 but currently live in @entity28 , had been dating for several years before she decided to take the plunge last april			1
she said : ' my partner and i first met at an @entity32 pub in @entity27			1
' we both very much enjoy drinking craft beer , visiting breweries , and sampling the local beers in every city ( and country ) we visit			0
' she continued : ' i knew he would love it if i tied this common interest into a proposal , so i picked a quiet craft beer pub in a residential area of @entity46 to bring things full circle			2
' i was a graduate student in @entity49 at the time , so @entity50 was n’t very far away			2
' i had a pint glass etched with ‘ @entity26 , after you finish this pint , i ’m going to ask you a question … ’ on the side , while the bottom that he ’d see after downing the pint said ‘ … will you marry me ? ’ the pint glass that @entity25 commissioned for her proposal to boyfriend @entity26 @entity26 was delighted with the proposal and immediately said yes , with the pair choosing to elope just a few months later			1
they said their handwritten vows on a hilltop in a quiet village on the island of @entity72 , which @entity25 describes as , ' one of the happiest moments of our lives			2
' @entity25 is proud of her decision to propose to @entity26 and believes that ms @entity3 ' views on marriage are outdated			1
she said : ' there are things of real importance women do every day that are cause for actual celebration			2
' a woman proposing to a man is not one of them , and i wish it were such an unremarkable event that we never felt the need to discuss it or to defend ourselves			0
' unfortunately , that is not the case , particularly not in the southern @entity91 where we are from			0
' etched onto the bottom of the pint glass was the question ' will you marry me ? ' while @entity25 and @entity26 's close friends and family were delighted at their happy news , she does admit that there was a backlash for more small minded people			1
she reveals : ' people asked if it was an april fools joke ( it was april 16th ) and asked me if the proposal was actually for real			0
' acquaintances of my partner had a hard time understanding the concept , and we heard the phrase ‘ real man ’ tossed around , as if a ‘ real man ’ is n’t any man			0
' but the main source of awkward interactions was my lack of an engagement ring			0
' @entity3 and @entity2 got into a @entity1 row yesterday after the reality star criticised the actor 's girlfriend for proposing to him @entity25 believes that in order for us to move into a fully equal society , issues like who proposes to who should n't even be a topic of conversation			1
she said : ' this narrative of men always proposing and that being the only option is incredibly dull			0
' when it comes to relationships , everyone should do what is best for them ; however , i refuse to believe that following a man ’s lead is what ’s best for every single woman			0
' perhaps some women , like me , want to make romantic gestures to their partner			0
' obviously there are far more important feminist issues in society than who is proposing to whom , but if we ’re going to speak out against gender roles , then why has this antiquated tradition remained so firmly in place ? ' instead , there ’s this stigma where people see a woman who proposes as someone who is tired of waiting around for the man to do it			0
' the word ‘ emasculation ’ is often thrown around when a woman proposes , and i find this entirely ridiculous and offensive to both men and women			2

@entity25 , 24 , proposed to fellow @entity27 @entity26 , 29 , in an @entity32 pub
she *applauds* @entity2 's girlfriend @entity7 for asking him to marry her
@entity25 tells @entity22 that it is time women and men took it as the norm
