@entity0 played 59 times for @entity2 and had his share of good days and bad			1
he was often a target for disgruntled fans who had to pin their disappointment on somebody			0
on saturday he took a belly - load of flak without even putting his boots on			1
on @entity15 ’s big @entity14 catch , @entity2 ’s opener against @entity12 , he provided co-commentary alongside @entity17			1
@entity0 is a decent bloke with a lifelong grasp of the game but late on saturday night into sunday morning , his interpretation of the action in front of him was simply too low - key and flat			1
hours on the clock , so to speak			0
@entity0 knows his stuff and is a passionate @entity43 but he was cast in a difficult and unfamiliar role by his @entity15 bosses			1
he sounded more like he was in the examination room for one of his coaching badges , not ‘ ringside ’ as two @entity50 football heavyweights slugged it out toe - to - toe in the heat of the @entity55 rainforest			2
indeed , his voice at times was so quiet he might as well have been auditioning for one of @entity15 ’s latest high - cost costume dramas			1
‘ it ’s after midnight here — for @entity66 ’s sake speak up ’ , the nation was shouting at the telly			0
warming up his vocal chords : @entity0 ( right ) with the @entity15 team before the match in @entity70 in television sport , a huge amount of time and money is spent making sure the ‘ showroom ’ , the tv studio , looks world - class and is filled with stellar names			1
they are the in - vision personalities and make the headlines			2
however , the commentary box is the real engine - room of any outside - broadcast			2
just do the sums yourself			0
as viewers we spend more actual time in the company of the commentators than their studio - based colleagues			2
sure , the opening titles , music , studio presentation , look , feel and contents give the output its distinctive style and tone , but i still think the hard yards are done in the commentary box			0
it is instinctive live broadcasting			0
good team : @entity0 is part of a @entity15 line - up that has many impressive pundits and analysts when the archive is raided for a memory it is the action and the voice that accompanies it that is on our screens , not how it was analysed later			1
a lot of attention and help is given to the studio guests , an aid not always replicated to those ‘ on the road ’			0
viewing figures for @entity2 ’s defeat were huge			1
the peak audience was 15.4million			0
11.5m average , with over 12m still watching well after midnight			0
fittingly , given the conditions in @entity70 , @entity128 ran 1980s movie @entity131 , a steamy affair of an altogether different nature , alongside it			0
@entity135 pick up the baton with @entity2 ’s final two group games and will score heavily			1
thursday evening ’s crunch match with @entity139 has a peak - time 8pm kick - off and @entity135 bosses hope the match reaches 20m viewers at its peak			2
laughing it off : @entity0 went on @entity146 on sunday to answer his critics elsewhere , i ’ve enjoyed the @entity55 players singing their anthem with such unrestrained emotion , the @entity153 goal celebrations , the free - kick ‘ foam ’ , crowd shots of fans having a great time , @entity158 ’s @entity2 reporting , @entity160 ’s touchline thoughts , @entity161 and @entity162 in their respective studios and @entity15 ’s @entity164 , for his deep knowledge of @entity166 and their way of life			1
but i ’ve already had enough of the @entity172 caption			0
just use it when you need to please .			0

@entity0 was @entity15 co-commentator for @entity2 vs @entity12
he was in a difficult and unfamiliar role
@entity0 *'s* *delivery* was quiet and low - key
