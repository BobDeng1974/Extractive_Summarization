by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 17:34 est , 10 january 2014 when it came to food trends in 2013 , it was all about pulled pork , meaty gourmet burgers , stylish meringues and brand new innovations such as the @entity9			1
now some of @entity12 's leading food experts , including a @entity13 starred chef , supper club owner and street food expert have been bought together by @entity17 , to predict what we 'll be eating in 2014 ... @entity20 was the trendy superfood of 2013 but the new rising star will be buckwheat			1
a fruit seed , neither a wheat or grain , is a great alternative to cous cous and quinoa and is suitable for those who are gluten intolerant			2
it can be used to make healthy pancakes and waffles or as a substitute for rice in a risotto - style dish			0

a @entity67 sandwich would definitely include thickly sliced rare beef and plenty of horseradish			0
' rejuvenated : truffles will become more accessible truffles have always been a high end restaurant staple but in 2014 they 'll be more accessible to the masses in the form of truffle crisps and truffle biscuits			1
food futurologist , @entity88 , said the resurgence of truffles will come as part of a trend for foraging for food			1
she said : ' @entity94 , greengages , old fruits like damsons , gooseberries , foraging for food and more mushroom varieties are all going to be big			2
truffles are definitely setto be this year 's food hero , and it wo n't just be limited to specialty dishes			1
' in light of a lack of faith in the meat industry following the horse meat scandal , more people are going to be turning to vegetarian options			0
but not everyone will forgo meat altogether and a new tribe of ' flexitarians ' will be born			0
@entity116 will be happy to eat quality meat but equally at home in a restaurant offering only vegetarian options			0
from the growth of street food markets to supper clubs and new community food sites , ' secret spaces ' is about being more adventurous when eating out and uncovering the new places to dine in your area			1

access to professional tools and techniques such as curing and smoking meats as well as adopting techniques such as sous vide , will become popular as people look to emulate restaurant quality food in the comfort of their own home			2
