in her new book , chief whip , @entity1 says : ' they started tussling with each other			2
as i leapt out of the way the sofa tipped over and they rolled out on to the floor , still fighting			2
' it was the hugging - and - rolling kind of fight , rather than punching - and - kicking			2
i thought it was hilarious			2
i told them , " come on , stop it , this is ridiculous ! " by the time they ’d calmed down and made up , nobody had thrown a punch			0
' she says the fight happened at an all - night party at her flat in the early 1990s where guests took cocaine and ecstasy and paid for sex with prostitutes , although it is not suggested @entity4 was involved in either			1
discussing the parties , @entity1 adds : ' thirty or 40 people would come			0
at this time @entity54 was triumphant			0
there was so much money around and the bars and clubs were full of energy			0
' these were golden years for hookers			0
even the recession did n’t slow things down			0
the crowd i hung around with certainly did n’t care about anyone who was suffering economic hardship			0
