it has been billed as high - minded prosecution to uphold the strict rules of @entity4 law			0
but @entity5 can reveal that the real reasons why a pregnant woman in @entity8 has been sentenced to death for being a @entity10 are all too human			1
jealousy and greed drove @entity14 ’s own family to file a lawsuit against her alleging apostasy and adultery which led to the criminal charges she now faces , it is claimed			2
authorities rule she is @entity26 because her father - who abandoned her when he was six , worshiped @entity28 , even though she was brought up by her @entity10 mother her half brother and half sister - who had not seen her for decades - tracked her down so they could get rid of her and take over her successful general store , @entity14 ’s lawyers alleged			1
the legal team for @entity14 , whose husband is an @entity36 citizen , are being paid for by @entity8 , a @entity36 - based non-profit that campaigns for human rights in the @entity40 country			1
a spokesman for the organization said : ‘ we believe the family filed the lawsuit because they want to gain control of the business			0
‘ if @entity14 stays in jail she could lose everything and they could be the ones to benefit			0
’ heartbreaking : this image captures the first time @entity54 was allowed to see @entity55 and @entity14 a few weeks ago			2
he has hardly been allowed to see her the spokeswoman added that if @entity14 is forced to leave @entity8 then her half brother and half sister may well take over the business as well			1
it is not clear if , under @entity61 law , such a scheme would work as intended , or if a business owner would be allowed to sell it on			0
but it gives a disturbing new insight into the reasons why an eight - months pregnant woman has been thrown in a prison cell in shackles with her 20 - month old boy whilst expecting her second child - and become the center of an international outcry			1
the heartbreaking situation was illustrated by exclusive pictures obtained by @entity5 which showed @entity14 ’s husband @entity24 , who is in a wheelchair , holding @entity55 under the close watch of prison guards with rifles slung over their shoulders			1
rotten care : @entity55 is given a drink by prison guards			0

the @entity119 spokeswoman said : ‘ when @entity14 ’s father left her mother when she was six he went to another part of @entity8 and had another family			2
‘ @entity14 did not know about this			0
she did not even know her father had died until many years after the event			0
nor did she know he was a @entity26			0
‘ @entity14 ’s mother died in 2012 and by then she had still not heard from her half brothers and sisters			0
‘ there were years and years that went by when that side of the family did not want a relationship with her			0
adultery : @entity14 has also been sentenced to 100 lashes because the court did not recognize her marriage to @entity138 , a naturalized @entity36 citizen , who lives in @entity93 , @entity94 outrage : more than 50 protesters gathered outside the @entity61 court last week where @entity14 was sentenced ‘ recently @entity14 has been running a successful business in @entity107			1
it ’s a general store in a shopping mall and she has been selling some @entity144 items as her mother was from there			1
‘ they ’ve been doing really well and the business was growing and @entity24 has been helping her out			0
‘ her half brother and half sister must have heard about this and worked out she was a relative of theirs because of her name			0
‘ the first thing @entity14 knew about them was when her half brother and half sister filed the lawsuit			2

’ this comes as @entity159 faced renewed calls to act on behalf of the @entity36 citizen whose heavily pregnant wife , son and unborn child are locked up in jail in @entity8 - as @entity5 reveals the family ’s emotional reunion behind bars			1
cruel : @entity55 , above , is pictured biting his lip unaware of the terrible fate his mother , @entity14 , faces after being sentenced to hang for refusing to consider herself a @entity10			1
his family claim he is @entity36 because his father has been granted @entity36 citizenship love : @entity14 and @entity24 met and married in @entity107			1
he was planning to bring her back to their modest home in @entity93 , @entity94 , last year but the paperwork was held up and she was arrested two senators have sent the secretary of state a second letter demanding that more be done to help @entity54 and @entity14 , who is awaiting a death sentence for marrying her @entity10 husband			1
@entity94 's senator @entity182 and fellow @entity184 senator @entity183 of @entity185 said they are concerned that the government is wasting time with bureaucracy			0
