by @entity1 reporter less than a month after @entity3 excommunicated members of the mob , a church procession has apparently defied him by changing route to honour a convicted gangster			1
the procession through @entity9 , a @entity10 town and stronghold of the ' ndrangheta crime syndicate , detoured to pass the home of an 82 - year - old convicted murderer			1
the mayor , local clergy , parents pushing baby strollers and dozens of local men carrying an ornate @entity21 statue marched past the home of the killer who , because of his age , was allowed to serve out his life sentence under house arrest			2
a statue of the @entity21 is carried during religious procession in @entity9 , @entity10 , which made a detour to pass the home of an 82 - year - old ' ndragheta boss and convicted murderer under house arrest the mayor , local clergy , parents pushing baby strollers and dozens of local men carrying an ornate @entity21 statue marched past the home of the killer , but three policemen left the procession in disgust and complained interior minister @entity40 on sunday denounced the tribute as ' deplorable and disgusting ' and praised three @entity43 policemen who abandoned the procession in disapproval			1
@entity43 officer @entity46 said he and his fellow officer walked away from the july 2 procession after the detour and headed to the church to complain about what happened			0
one of @entity10 's anti-mafia prosecutors , @entity53 , told @entity54 that the detour to the mobster 's house appeared to be a ' challenge to the diktat ' of @entity3			1
the ' ndrangheta , a global cocaine trafficker , is one of the world 's most powerful crime syndicates			0
religious rituals hold an important place in the mobsters ' mentality			0
on june 21 , @entity3 , visiting @entity10 , had denounced the ' ndrangheta for its ' adoration of evil ' and said its members were excommunicated			2
the town 's bishop said he would take ' measures ' against those who exploited the procession to defy @entity3 , pictured right in @entity10 on the day he denounced and excommunicated members of the ' ndragheta @entity81 's bishop , monsignor @entity80 , said he would take undescribed ' measures ' against those exploiting the church procession to pay homage to the local boss			2
elsewhere in southern @entity88 , other ' ndrangheta members appeared to have paid attention to the pope 's words but perhaps not in the way he intended			0
another bishop , monsignor @entity93 , told @entity94 sunday that some 200 inmates in the maximum - security section of @entity98 prison told their chaplain they would boycott @entity100 they reasoned that if they had been excommunicated it made no sense for them to attend anymore .			0
