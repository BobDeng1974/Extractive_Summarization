that @entity0 continue to make the concept of a striker seem wholly unnecessary is why we can not pack away this title race along with the @entity6 decorations			1
it is six goals and six points since @entity10 had a recognised centre - forward on the pitch			0
and that was an 18 - year - old called up in emergency			0
@entity15 hold the lead in the @entity18 table , but this is an impressive sequence city are assembling shorn of their most potent goalscorers			0
click here to see this and more on @entity23 's brilliant @entity73 at @entity74 @entity62 was again asked for his best @entity76 impression up front			0
again the @entity79 ’s absence through injury was not felt due to the intelligence and industry of @entity0 ’s outfield @entity83			1
not missed either were @entity85 or @entity66 , who was at least fit enough for a place on the bench			0
in a quick - fire start that stunned @entity24 , @entity30 scored his first goal for @entity0 , @entity26 hammered home a penalty and @entity27 stroked in a sumptuous finish to give @entity0 a 3 - 0 advantage by the 34th minute			1
the closest that lead looked to disappearing came when the pitch was blanketed with snow in the second half and the ball was at times barely visible			2
@entity0 midfielder @entity30 netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes against @entity24 at the @entity101 @entity30 celebrates his opener by hugging team - mate @entity62 before being joined by @entity28 , @entity27 and @entity55 @entity0 midfielder was then fouled by @entity24 captain @entity36 to win a penalty @entity0 midfielder toure then converted a penalty to make it 2 - 0 after @entity27 had been fouled in the box just five minutes later @entity108 miles @entity24 111.2 69.1 @entity39 90 11.3 7.0 @entity40 90 11.2 6.9 @entity35 90 10.8 6.7 @entity0 110.4 68.6 @entity62 90 12.3 7.7 @entity30 90 11.0 6.9 @entity28 90 11.0 6.8 as the white stuff fell , @entity53 horribly mistimed a punch to @entity43 ’s corner with three minutes left to hand @entity24 a consolation			1
the ball hit @entity31 then brushed the back of @entity116 ’s head to cross the line			0
a priceless gift for a striker without a @entity18 goal since his £ 9million move – but worthless in the context of this game			0
the real story was that @entity10 could enjoy a seventh straight league win by taking off @entity27 and @entity26 with more than 20 minutes left in preparation for the visit of @entity128 on sunday			1
@entity0 will go into that buoyed by their performance in this opening period			1
their attacks were clinical and fluid , too fast for @entity24 ’s defence to deal with			1
@entity62 , @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity28 worked as a carousel , interchanging positions and exchanging passes			1
that is not to deny the hosts offered far too much seasonal good will			0
the first two goals were defensive errors gobbled up with glee			0
@entity34 was guilty of a worse mistake than @entity53 – with bad weather not yet a mitigating factor – and @entity36 conceded a spot - kick with a lunge that was not really necessary			2
@entity36 , captaining @entity24 , failed to have the kind of game he would have hoped for against the manager who jettisoned him last season			1
by half - time , @entity10 knew the points were won and @entity0 relaxed to conserve energy for this busy period			1
opposition managers @entity10 of @entity0 ( left ) and @entity52 of @entity24 prowl the touchline during the first half @entity161 midfielder @entity27 slotted in a third from inside the area just after half an hour @entity161 midfielder @entity27 celebrates scoring a third goal for @entity0 to put them 3 - 0 up after 34 minutes @entity24 goalkeeper @entity34 looks dejected in the snow after @entity24 's awful first half display @entity0 players defend a free - kick taken by @entity42 of @entity24 during the match at the @entity171 they were ahead in the eighth minute			1
@entity24 had already looked susceptible to the speed with which @entity0 attacked but how they actually went behind was entirely avoidable			1
@entity28 fired a cross that looped off @entity42 into the area			0
@entity34 reached to claim instead of leave but succeeded only in palming the ball down to the spot @entity30 had walked into			1
the @entity179 hooked a finish back over his head past @entity35 on the line			1
five minutes later the lead was doubled			2
@entity27 advanced and tried to slip in @entity184 but @entity36 placed a foot in the way			1
as the ball bounced loose , @entity27 nipped in and @entity36 ’s challenge brought down the @entity189 just inside the area			2
@entity68 instantly pointed to the spot , dismissing @entity36 ’s claims he got the ball			2
replays showed he had but only ever so slightly , as gently as those flakes falling from the sky touched the grass			0
@entity26 ran up and belted his penalty into the corner , his sixth goal in an increasingly productive campaign			2
the manner he played this game suggested @entity0 had handed him an especially large @entity6 cake			2
defender @entity54 of @entity0 signals as snow falls during the @entity18 match things looking festive as snow falls at @entity24 's stadium @entity74 on @entity210 @entity27 runs through the snow at @entity101 during @entity0 's comfortable victory over @entity24 by this stage , those in the home stands sensed a drubbing			1
on the half - hour mark a slick attack saw @entity28 feed @entity27 who lifted badly over			1
he made no mistake 11 minutes before the interval			2
@entity30 pounced on a loose ball in front of @entity39 , advancing and giving possession to @entity28 , who cut back for @entity27			1
there was a shimmy and caressed left - foot finish , more pass than shot			0
wrong - footed @entity34 had no chance			0
3 - 0 , job done			0
only the conditions and energy conservation limited @entity0 ’s scoring here			1
before the break @entity46 , on his first start since december 2 , should have done better than hook two finishes wide when played in by @entity39 and in the second half @entity44 miscued from close range from a good @entity41 cross			0
although @entity55 was largely composed , he did err to hand grant @entity39 a chance from distance that @entity53 had to save			0
later , @entity36 could have atoned with a goal but headed over inside the six - yard box			0
@entity10 revealed @entity247 could be fit to return for the @entity128 game			0
@entity0 failed to keep a fifth successive clean sheet due to @entity53 ’s late lapse but recorded a ninth straight win in all competitions to equal a club record			2
@entity62 celebrated by stripping of his shirt and flinging it to the away crowd , a brave call given the temperature			0
but just as brave as his performance the previous 90 minutes			0
those @entity0 supporters sung of their status as champions with great gusto , in full belief they can retain their title yet .			2

@entity30 , @entity26 and @entity27 strike in the first half as @entity0 beat @entity24
@entity179 @entity30 opens scoring after eight minutes while @entity26 scores from spot five minutes later
@entity27 adds a third for @entity0 just after half hour mark as @entity24 are blown away at the @entity272
