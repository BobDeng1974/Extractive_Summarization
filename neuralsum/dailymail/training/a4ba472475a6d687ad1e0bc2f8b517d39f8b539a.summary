@entity1 's host @entity0 failed to keep up appearances for sponsor 's @entity3 during sunday night 's ceremony when she kept posting pictures to @entity7 backstage from her own @entity8			1
shooting what seemed like a carefully coordinated social - media and advertising blitz in the foot , @entity0 snapped the now - famous @entity15 selfie and several other pictures with her @entity17 live on air , but when she was off camera , she reverted to her trusty @entity21 smartphone			1
having spent upwards of $ 25 million over the past five years of @entity1 ceremonies at $ 1.8 million for 30 - seconds of advertising space , @entity3 would have been dismayed to see their chief rival gatecrashing what should have been a promotional coup for the @entity30 firm			1
the two - time host was rumbled because the source of the photograph as posted to @entity7 can not be seen on their own page , but this information is visible by using a third - party app such as @entity59			2
and in at at least two pictures posted to @entity7 by @entity62 , the source was revealed to be her @entity8			1
to make matters worse for @entity3 , the @entity30 firm was also @entity66 's ' @entity65 ' sponsor , which called for a series of 10 promoted tweets of celebrity selfies to be posted online during the ceremony			2
however , while @entity3 have not responded publicly yet to the mild embarrassment of @entity0 ' mix - and - matching of smartphones , they still have the huge publicity that the a-list selfie generated as it was re-tweeted almost 3 million times and crashed @entity7			1
' @entity3 's unique product placement , woven into the moment , front and center , without seeming ham - handed , generated the type of positive buzz that is rarely seen and is actually hard to buy , " said @entity78 , evp of products and marketing for @entity81 , a prominent social media data tracker			2
' kudos to @entity0 for pulling it off , ' said @entity78 to @entity90			0
@entity0 is n't the first celebrity to have her choice of smartphone questioned			2
@entity95 @entity94 was called out for tweets sent via @entity8 after she had been named @entity97 for smartphone maker blackberry			2
but she blamed the incident of hackers			0
whoops : while @entity3 would have thought their pr victory was complete with the selfie - backstage @entity0 was posting pictures to @entity7 taken on her @entity8 and despite their huge presence at the @entity1 's during which they launched a whole new range of products including their new @entity108 smartphone , @entity109 have denied they had paid @entity0 or @entity66 any money or engineered the celebrity - packed selfie			1
the @entity30 firm did admit to ' an integration with @entity66 ' but the firm said that it was @entity62 who chose to ' organically incorporate the device into the selfie moment that had everyone talking			0
' in addition , @entity3 said it would be donating $ 1.5 million each to two of ' @entity0 ’s charities of choice , ' namely @entity123 ’s and the @entity124			1
but in a move which seemed to confirm at least some kind of publicity tie - in , @entity3 and @entity0 gifted her audience all a @entity39 smartphone as she presented her show today			1
on sunday night @entity62 repeatedly brandished her @entity39 during the ceremony she hosted - taking selfies of stars such as oscar winner @entity134 , which she posted online			2
the impromptu and now iconic selfie , which @entity0 claimed was not intended , set the record for the most retweeted post ever and even temporarily disrupted @entity7 's service			1
the previously most - retweeted @entity7 post was by president @entity142 after winning his second term in 2012			0
that tweet got 778,000 retweets			0
more @entity8 uploads : this picture of @entity1 winner @entity148 was taken on an @entity8 and uploaded to @entity0 's @entity7 account as was the picture ( right ) of her about to walk onstage on message : this selfie taken by @entity0 featuring @entity1 winner @entity134 was snapped on the comediennes @entity39 promotional gifts : on her show the day after the @entity1 's ceremony , @entity0 handed out free @entity17 smartphones to her ecstatic audience thanks @entity0 : @entity0 handed the phones to her audience the day after hosting the @entity1 's to rapturous applause from the crowd @entity0 ’ tweet even knocked @entity7 offline for a bit , racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes			1
' we crashed and broke @entity7 , ' @entity0 said later from the stage			1
' @entity7 declined to comment on the service glitches except for a statement on its status blog according to the @entity173 : ' between 19:05 and 19:29 pst today , some users may have experienced issues viewing and sending tweets on twitter.com and @entity7 ’s mobile apps			0
' @entity179 was redirected away from the components that were experiencing problems , and the issue has now been resolved			0
' however , @entity7 did send a congratulatory tweet to @entity0 remarking , ' the envelope please … to @ @entity185 -- this is now the most retweeted tweet with over 1 million @entity187			1
congrats ! ' @entity0 's @entity3 use was designed to highlight its new range of products including the @entity193 tablet , the @entity108 phone , the @entity195 smartwatch and a curved ultra-high - definition tv			1
as part of a deal with broadcast network , @entity66 , @entity3 also sponsored 10 tweets from @entity0 featuring selfies in the backstage green room and posted onto the account of the @entity204			1
however , @entity0 seems to have posted 4 out of her ten from her @entity8 , not her @entity108 which operates the @entity206 platform			1
crash : @entity0 ' tweet even knocked @entity7 offline for a bit , racking up more than 700,000 retweets and nearly 200,000 favorites in just 30 minutes			2
let me in : the selfie was not planned by @entity0 to unfold this way - it was meant to be a quick joke at the expense of @entity219 and quickly became something else entirely can we get everyone in ? @entity0 originally wanted to take a selfie with @entity219 and crop her head off in the picture it seems though , that one thing @entity0 was sure of crashing @entity7 in the wake of her sensational selfie			1
' i thought it would crash , ' @entity0 told @entity232 's @entity233 at the @entity234			0
' but i did n't know everyone would do it			0
' the comedienne told @entity232			0
' what 's funny is that @entity240 's brother is the most prominent			0
and then @entity148 came running over to be in it			0
and @entity242 got it in			0
i did n't expect all that			0
' indeed , @entity0 even revealed that she originally wanted to do a visual joke with the selfie by taking the picture and cropping @entity219 's head from it			2
' that was going to be the joke , ' she revealed			0
' but it does n't matter			0

@entity0 broke @entity7 records and crashed the site after she posted an *incredible* selfie using her @entity39 smartphone
the phone is made by official @entity1 sponsors @entity3
the picture was re-tweeted more than *2.7* million times - proving a huge public relations success for @entity3 and @entity7
however , it was *spotted* that backstage , @entity0 used her @entity8 to tweet pictures and not her @entity3 phone
@entity3 deny they paid for @entity0 to use their phone for the selfie
but have *announced* a $ 3 million donation towards two charities of her choice
