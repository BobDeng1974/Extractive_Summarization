a man in @entity1 who signed up for a state - approved health insurance plan in november has now been told that he did n’t have coverage for the first two months of this year even though he was paying premiums for that time			1
@entity6 ’s ordeal that has landed him with $ 407,000 in hospital bills is the latest example of the problems facing @entity11 residents due to the state ’s problem - riddled exchange system			1
on tuesday , a state panel approved a $ 1.5million consulting contract in an effort to have a private firm fix the state ’s exchange			1
outraged : @entity6 's heart surgery on january 3 has led to $ 407,000 - worth of bills that his health insurance will not cover because the state exchange claims he is on another plan missing pieces : the @entity11 ' @entity11 ' heath insurance exchange has listed @entity6 , who had triple bypass surgery in january , that he was signed up with a different plan than the one he has been paying since november mr @entity6 comes as a clear example of crossed wires resulting in six - figure bills			1
after spending weeks trying to sign up for ‘ @entity33 ’ when the buggy national website first launched on october i , he purchased a plan with @entity37 in mid-november			2
‘ it was like reaching the third level of @entity41 , ’ he told the @entity38			0
he made his first premium payment for $ 160.77 on november 21 and because that was before the december 23 deadline that the @entity45 administration put into place , that meant his care was due to be activated on january 1			1
addressing the issue : @entity11 governor @entity49 has inquired specifically about mr @entity6 's case multiple times and used hm as an example of the problems with the state system for mr @entity6 , 62 , health insurance could n’t have come at a better time because on december 31 he had a heart attack			1
he had a triple bypass surgery on january 3 and the operation combined with its ensuing care led to a total of $ 407,000 bills for january and february			1
even though he has only ever been signed up for - and been paying bills for - @entity37 ’s @entity67 , the state exchange somehow lists him as being an enrollee for an alternative plan , run by @entity70 ' if he had picked our health plan , we would be advocating for a solution			1
but he did n’t pick us , ' @entity75 ceo @entity74 told the state 's exchange board			2
the state exchange , which has @entity79 as it ’s contractor , attempted to right the wrong by saying that they would list mr @entity6 as a client of @entity75 for january and february before switching him to @entity37 in march , but that still would n’t solve the issue of addressing the bills from his heart attack			1
all the while , @entity6 continued paying the monthly bills for his insurance premiums in january and february			2
' @entity79 is truly out of their league			0
they need to understand they are an administrator , they are not an insurance company , ' mr @entity6 's insurance broker @entity92 of @entity93 said			0
' they need to understand their boundaries			0
they do n’t understand this world			0
everybody is at the mercy of @entity79 , and they are not doing this right			0
' i believe @entity79 is covering themselves because of a huge system error			0
they do n’t want the accountability of saying , " yes , we did mess this up , and here ’s the plan you selected			0
" it ’s like , " what did he pay for ? " that ’s it			0
they are making this more complicated than it has to be			0
’ working through the issues : the @entity11 exchange is now being revamped after the governor approved a $ 1.5million consulting contract to have their system reworked as a result of the thousands of crossed wires mr @entity6 is not alone , as ms @entity132 estimates that more than 20 of her clients have faced the same problem , and other estimates suggest that 22,000 @entity136 have faced various problems enrolling in the federally - mandated insurance plans			1
the @entity38 reports that governor @entity49 has been told by @entity79 that they plan to work with @entity140 , the consulting firm elected to fix their state exchange			1
' we should never be here today for this but we are , ' he said when mr @entity49 approved the $ 1.5million contract			2
' we , being the state of @entity11 , can not go through this again			0
' mr @entity49 specifically mentioned mr @entity6 's case when he announced the consulting hire on tuesday , and he was n't thrilled when @entity79 spokesman @entity150 said that they are ' much closer ' to finding a solution			2
the governor asked for further clarification ' because that 's the same answer that i 've gotten for the past three months ' .			0

@entity6 now faces six - figure hospital bills because the state exchange says he is signed up for a different plan than he actually is
@entity6 signed up for a @entity37 plan in mid-november and because that was ahead of the @entity165 's december 23 deadline , his coverage was supposed to start on january 1
he had a heart attack on december 31 and had a triple bypass on january 3
even though he had been paying for his @entity37 plan since november , the state exchange says their *records* place him with a different company , @entity175 co-op
governor @entity49 just approved a $ 1.5million consulting contract so that @entity140 can come in and fix the state 's exchange program
