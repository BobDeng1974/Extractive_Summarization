published : 04:05 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 06:42 est , 22 may 2012 the types of drugs taken at music festivals often varies depending on the lineup , police figures show			0
records of the substances seized at 10 major festivals over the past four years indicate how common drug use is and how , while fans at one event are more likely to be found in possession of cannabis , those at another might prefer cocaine or ecstasy			0
the data , which comes to light as legions of music fans gear up for the summer festival season , also shows seizures of cannabis and cocaine are falling - with the trend thought to be down to changes in festival - goers ' habits , demographics and police tactics			1
revellers at the @entity31 , @entity32 , where almost £ 45,000 worth of drugs were seized use of cocaine , a relatively expensive class - a substance at around £ 40 a gram , appears to have dropped particularly dramatically as cash - strapped festival crowds look to cheaper drugs such as the horse transquilliser ketamine			1
according to the figures , compiled and analysed by the @entity42 , last year saw officers confiscate drugs with a total street value of more than £ 100,000 , with almost £ 45,000 of that from @entity47 alone			1
large quantities of cannabis and ecstasy were taken from revellers at the @entity32 event , but higher still were the figures for ketamine and the stimulant piperazine			0
glastonbury organiser @entity56 insists there is no drug problem at his festival , where substances worth £ 200,000 have been seized over four years most of last year 's cocaine seizures were made at the @entity66 festival and , together with @entity67 , which also takes places on the island , it accounted for most of the ecstasy confiscated across the 10 festivals			1
it is thought the differences in the range of drugs brought to such events is linked partly to the acts on stage			0
@entity79 ( @entity79 ) is a much smaller music festival than the likes of @entity47 and @entity67 and the crowds it draws are typically older and middle - class , with a taste for obscure world music			1
while headliners at @entity47 included bands famed for their lyrics about drug - fuelled excess - @entity91 or @entity92 , for example - last year 's @entity79 fans could be found contemplating @entity94 singer @entity93 or flamenco stars @entity96			2
@entity97 was the only illegal substance seized by police at the @entity101 festival , with a street value of just £ 151			2
meanwhile , download in @entity104 and @entity105 at @entity106 , @entity107 , might have been dominated by heavy metal acts , but it seems relatively few fans were out to emulate the rock star lifestyle			0
police at @entity105 , where 190,000 people flocked to watch @entity113 and @entity114 , made a fairly modest haul worth £ 413			0
this was made up of cannabis and a small amount of cocaine , while ecstasy and amphetamines - more commonly associated with dance music - were not found			2
after @entity47 and the two events on the @entity66 , the fourth largest drugs haul was at v festival , held at @entity126 in @entity127 and @entity128 in @entity129			0
the total value of £ 7,111 was mostly made up of cannabis and ecstasy , but piperazine also featured			0
changing habits : cannabis seizures are falling , as are those of cocaine - but lesser known substances such as ketamine and @entity139 are on the rise three friends at last year 's @entity142 , where more than £ 27,000 worth of drugs - mostly cocaine and ecstasy - were seized the twin festivals at @entity147 and @entity148 saw similar totals of £ 804 and £ 797 respectively , though cannabis and methadone were the most common at @entity147 while at @entity148 it was cocaine and mephedrone			1
finally , drugs confiscated at @entity156 , in @entity158 's @entity157 , were worth a total of £ 585 , including cannabis and unknown class a tablets			1
at @entity47 , where organiser @entity56 last year denied there was a drug problem , more than £ 200,000 worth of drugs has been seized in four years			1
at £ 44,869 , the value of substances confiscated at the 2011 festival marked a 12 per cent increase on the previous year , though this was still lower than the peak in 2009			2
the value of piperazine seized , also known as @entity139 , has seen a tenfold rise over four years , though it is still less than half as common as each of cannabis , ecstasy and cocaine			2
@entity179 , known as a ' party drug ' popular among younger users , also appears to be on the rise and was most commonly found at @entity47 .			0

almost £ 45,000 worth of drugs confiscated at @entity47 last year
at the other end of the scale was small - scale world music festival @entity79 , with £ 151 worth of drugs seized from typically older , middle - class crowd
cannabis and cocaine on the way down as seizures of lesser known ' party drugs ' such as ketamine and @entity139 increase
