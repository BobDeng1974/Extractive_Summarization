by @entity1 reporter published : 16:23 est , 11 february 2014 @entity3 : 08:52 est , 12 february 2014 two 26 year - old women living on separate continents - one of them an actress in @entity8 , the other a fashion designer in @entity10 - have spoken of the moment they came to discover each other as identical twins			1
@entity14 and @entity15 were separated at birth			1
miss @entity14 was taken to @entity17 by her adoptive parents , while @entity19 was raised in @entity20			1
they 've nearly reached their $ 80,000 goal it all began last february			1
' i got message on @entity66 from a girl in @entity10 , ' @entity19 , an actress , said in an interview on @entity69			2
' it said she had seen me in a @entity72 video , then after looking my name up online , saw that we were both adopted , and born on the same day , in the same city			0
when i saw her profile , it was crazy			0
she looked just like me			0
' the message had been sent by @entity14 , a @entity17 fashion designer in @entity10			1
' when i looked at the video , i - it was , like , shocking ... , ' @entity14 said			1
' you ca n't imagine that you might have a twin sister somewhere that you do n't know about			0
' last february miss @entity14 , who is studying at @entity83 in @entity10 but was raised as an only child in a @entity86 suburb , had been watching a @entity72 film when she noticed that an actress in the clip looked very similar to her			1
she also shared similar mannerisms to the actress , who turned out to be @entity19 , who grew up in @entity92 , @entity20 and was living in @entity8			0
history : the sisters say they always felt as though something was missing in their lives			0
they never knew that they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately hey , you look familiar ! the original @entity66 message that @entity14 send to her would - be sister coincidence : they would soon discover they both have been adopted after being born on the same day in the same @entity105 city			1
could it be ? were they identical twins separated at birth ? growing up : @entity14 grew up in @entity17 while @entity19 spent her childhood in @entity20 @entity111 : the two have now taken a dna test that confirms that they are indeed related			1
over the last year they have been filming to make a documentary together as they travel and learn about each other 's lives is it really you ? the first time the twins met each other , they had to touch each other just to be doubly sure miss @entity14 contacted aspiring actress @entity19 on @entity123 and the women say they soon worked out that they were both born in the @entity105 town of @entity126 on november 19 , 1987			1
@entity14 and @entity19 , who appeared together for this morning 's interview , decided to start chatting via @entity54			1
both women speak @entity129 , although @entity17 is @entity14 ' first language			1
@entity19 described this morning looking into @entity14 's face and seeing a mirror of her own features			1
nonetheless , they 've had their @entity135 tested to erase any doubt that they 're sisters			0
' it was weird , but i feel like there was a strange calm and comfort as well , and something that i ca n't really explain , ' @entity19 said			0
' we talked for three hours			0
' they met for the first time in @entity10 , then in @entity8 , and now they 've united again in @entity149			2
the pair have now taken a dna test to clear up any doubt and the results proved what they knew deep inside : they were sisters			1
my second heart : the twins feel as though everything is perfect now that they have found one another filmmakers : they decided to make a documentary about their experience and say they 've already heard from countless other adoptees thanking them emotions : the girls say they often felt as though something was missing in their lives but that they feel they have extra confidence knowing they found their second heart proof : the @entity135 result proved what their faces told them all along : they were sisters the ' twinsters , ' as they have since dubbed themselves , shared an immediate and undeniable bond			1
two women decided to share their emotional meeting with others and launched a @entity59 campaign to raise funds for a documentary tracking their ' possible siblingship ' â€” which would culminate in the release of their dna results , proving whether or not they are in fact related			1
over the last year , the twins have been able to capture tons of amazing moments along their journey , including two weeks at @entity15 's home in @entity195 , and 10 days in their birthplace , @entity198 , @entity105 , where they visited their adoption agency together			1
all in all , the sisters have collected 42,000 video clips together			0
@entity14 says she felt as though something was missing in her life			2
she said that her father had cried upon meeting miss @entity19 , while her mother believed that the pair were so alike that they had to be sisters			2
they both share a love of @entity212 , the arts , and many of the same television programmes , while @entity215 confessed that the duo had taken advantage of their physical similarities to play a trick on miss @entity19 's mother and father			0
' i came out first and surprised them and they stopped for five seconds , saying , ' what ? what ? no ! ' and they said we were identical too			0
it was just like @entity231			0
' after she and her sister were born , they were each placed in separate foster care agencies and adopted separately			0
so much to catch up on : the time they first met online , they shared their entire life stories in that first conversation , chatting for three hours pure chance : the story is remarkable that they managed to find each other after 25 years , yet neither knew of the others ' existence ! ' i did feel like i missed something , ' she said			2
' i had an imaginary friend when i was a kid			0
it happens to a lot of kids , but i had an imaginary friend and she was called @entity255 ... i needed that comfort , i guess , ' she added			0
@entity19 has two adoptive brothers , while @entity14 is the only child in her family			2
' it makes me really emotional , because as a kid you have dreams of wanting to change the world			0
it 's something -- it 's something that feels too far away ... it 's an overwhelming thing to know that two little , tiny , @entity269 hobbits can , you know , make a difference , ' she said , laughing			2
the pair have decided to make a documentary about their experience , and they say they 've already heard from many other adoptees who are thankful to them for sharing their experience			2
they 're still raising money to help with the post-production of the documentary and have almost reached their $ 80,000 goal			1
for @entity282 , @entity19 got necklaces that say ' @entity284 ' for her and her sister			0
' it sounds really cheesy , but i think we need those little kid 's moments and those cheesy moments together , ' @entity14 said			2
@entity19 described finding her sister like ' that feeling on christmas when you open up the presents , the one you were asking for , it 's that - that pure feeling of joy - that 's how i always feel			0

@entity14 and @entity15 believed they were separated at birth in @entity105
