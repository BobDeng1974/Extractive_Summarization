by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 man city must dominate in europe to keep sheikh mansour @entity4 has wrecked @entity8 's @entity7 career let me highlight three young @entity7 players who ended the @entity11 season on a high , and who i would love to see build on that next season			0
firstly , @entity14 at @entity15			1
he poked home his first goal for the @entity17 at @entity18 and then charged towards the travelling fans to celebrate like it meant the world to him – probably because it did			1
he ’s an @entity15 fan , from a family of @entity15 fans and having met him and talked to him i can confirm it is genuine – this kid is a gooner through and through			2
if he was n’t playing for them , he ’d have been in the away end at @entity29			0
boyhood dream : @entity15 fan @entity14 scored his first goal for the club in the 2 - 0 win over @entity18 on sunday what a moment : @entity14 has supported @entity15 all his life and realised a dream by scoring in a @entity17 ' shirt it must have been so frustrating for @entity14 to watch @entity37 picked ahead of him week in week out last season			1
especially when you see the @entity42 squad and realise another right - back is needed			0
i ’m a big fan of @entity14 , i think he has the talent that can be developed and turn him into a top full - back for club and country			1
from an @entity42 fan ’s point of view , i hope @entity37 leaves @entity15 this summer – he ’s being linked with @entity50			2
@entity42 need @entity14 to blossom at the @entity51 sooner rather than later			2
and how lucky are the @entity17 fans ? they have one of their own playing for them , and caring about the results and performances as much as they do			0
whoever you support , you ’d all love a player like that in your team			0
first choice : @entity37 has played ahead of @entity14 in @entity15 's defence this season secondly , @entity63			1
as a @entity67 fan , i watched him at @entity67 and even though he was only with the club a few months , and we were relegated in that time , it was obvious he had the ability to go higher			0
@entity71 paid £ 6m for him - and in all honesty it was probably too much - but the critics could n’t stop banging on and on about that transfer fee			2
especially when it emerged @entity76 did n’t really know how to get the best out of him , and @entity63 then got injured			2
he scored @entity71 ’s goal of the season – a stunning strike to win a @entity82 fixture at @entity83 – but i always got the impression @entity85 felt @entity63 was too much of a risk while @entity71 were still fighting for survival			1
top form : @entity63 has shown he can handle the pressure in the @entity11 with a number of goals for @entity71 curled : @entity63 fires home a free - kick to score his second goal for @entity71 in the 2 - 2 draw at @entity95 on sunday allowed to play a part with @entity71 safe , @entity63 flourished			1
he did n’t just score goals , he took up positions , he made runs , he outwitted defenders			0
he started only eight @entity11 games for @entity71 this season , but ended up top scorer for the club			1
that ’s some achievement for a player who was playing in the sixth tier with @entity110 two years ago			0
there is speculation @entity63 will be sold by @entity85 this summer			2
i hope the manager has seen enough to challenge himself to turn @entity63 into an international striker			0
to be honest i would have been happier seeing @entity63 on @entity118 ’s @entity117 standby list ahead of @entity119			1
on call : @entity63 should be ahead of @entity121 's @entity119 on @entity42 's stand - by list for the @entity117 thirdly , another player who i felt was ahead of @entity119 for @entity42 recognition : @entity127 ’s @entity126			1
for so many reasons he should have been on @entity118 ’s standby list			1
he ended the season strongly , making a major contribution to @entity127 ’s incredible survival run			0
but he has also represented @entity42 at several age levels , including 17 games for the under - 21s and he has tournament experience at that level as well			0
his brilliant form at the right time should have been rewarded with a place on standby for the @entity117 , and that would also be a way for @entity118 to tell young players if they do the business at junior @entity42 levels , that will be recognised at senior level			1
leaving @entity126 out makes me wonder if the under - 21s are worthwhile			0
@entity126 needs to bring consistency over the course of a season in the @entity11			0
i ’m hoping he achieves that in 2014 - 15			0
fine season : @entity126 has been instrumental in @entity127 's @entity153 from the @entity11 relegation zone			1

@entity14 's goal at @entity18 shows how much he loves @entity15
@entity63 has shown he can cut it at top level with goals for @entity71
@entity126 should have been above @entity119 on @entity117 standby list
