remarkable : captain @entity0 returned to a @entity2 pow camp after being given permission to leave to visit his dying mother in @entity5 by the @entity6 when @entity5 prisoner of war @entity0 asked the @entity6 if he could visit his dying mother , he was astonished to be given permission – on condition that he promised to return			1
the @entity12 captain kept his word and returned to the @entity2 camp after the two - week trip in november 1916 , remaining in captivity until the end of the @entity18			1
historian @entity19 , who discovered the incredible incident , said such an act of chivalry was rare even a century ago			2
‘ capt @entity0 was an officer and he made a promise on his honour to go back , ’ he said			1
‘ had he not turned up there would not have been any retribution on any other prisoners			0
‘ what i think is more amazing is that the @entity12 let him go back to @entity2			1
the @entity5 could have said to him , “ you ’re not going back , you ’re going to stay here ”			0
’ capt @entity0 , who joined the @entity12 in 1903 , was leading the 1st @entity33 when his battalion took up a position on the @entity36 in north - west @entity37 just weeks after war broke out in july 1914			1
a week later , his troops were attacked by the @entity2 forces and capt @entity0 was seriously injured and captured			1
the 29 - year - old was treated in a military hospital in @entity43 before being sent to the prisoner - of - war camp in @entity45			2
in 1916 , he received word from home that his mother @entity48 was dying of cancer			1
he wrote to @entity50 , begging to be allowed to see her one last time			2
the @entity6 gave him two weeks ’ compassionate leave , including two days travelling in each direction by boat and train , on the proviso capt @entity0 gave his word as a @entity12 officer that he would return			1
capt @entity0 reached his mother ’s bedside in @entity61 , @entity62 , on november 7 and spent a week with her before keeping his promise and returning to @entity2			1
his mother died three months later in february 1917			2
mr @entity19 , 48 , discovered the amazing story after reading correspondence between the @entity67 and their @entity2 counterparts and it is told in his new book , meeting the enemy : the @entity71			1
he said of capt @entity0 ’s amazing story : ‘ i think it is such a unique example that i do n’t think you can draw any parallels			2
in my experience , this is a one - off and is one of those things that just tickles your fancy			0
however , he rejoined his regiment in 1939 on the outbreak of the @entity107 , serving as the @entity108 of the @entity109 on the @entity110			0
he survived that war unscathed and died in @entity5 in july 1966 aged 81			0
mr @entity19 ’s book charts the personal contacts between @entity5 and @entity2 and their feelings towards each other as the @entity18 progressed			2
discovery : historian @entity117 ( pictured left ) made the discovery of the documents about capt @entity0 who lead the 1st @entity33 whose badge is pictured , right more detail : this official memo from the @entity124 in @entity125 showed that the agreement between @entity0 and the @entity2 went via the @entity127 did n't work both ways : @entity2 @entity129 asked to be allowed to leave the @entity110 to visit his dying father , but the @entity5 refused to accept captain @entity0 's case set a precedent the highest display of respect he discovered was between pilots fighting above the lines			1
the pilots did not carry parachutes because they were too bulky for the narrow cockpits of the day			0
if their aircraft caught fire , they faced the choice of burning alive or jumping out			0
@entity2 pilots made it a habit to find their victims , dead or alive			2
if dead , they sent details of their names and burial sites across @entity5 lines			0
if found alive , they would invite them to a slap - up meal in their mess			0
both sides were ruthless when fighting each other in the air but observed the rules of chivalry on the ground			0
troop : capt @entity0 was among troops like these ones when he was captured at the very start of the war recovery : captain @entity0 was was treated at this military hospital in @entity43 before he was taken to the pow camp prisoner of war : capt @entity0 had been leading the 1st @entity33 when his battalion fought at the @entity174 in north - western @entity37 ( pictured ) , where he was injured and captured incredibly @entity50 granted the request allowing the officer two weeks leave as long as he returned @entity50 , the last emperor of @entity2 , had a schizophrenic relationship with @entity5 until he was forced to abdicate in 1918			1
he was queen @entity178 ’s grandson and his mother was @entity178 , princess royal , who married @entity181 in 1858			0
@entity50 developed a passion for @entity5 , but was furious that he was never accepted by its high society			0
the expansion of the @entity2 navy before the war was inspired by his love , and his mother ’s , for the @entity190			1
he once told his uncle @entity191 that his dream was to have a ‘ fleet of my own some day ’			0
historian @entity194 said : ‘ the half - @entity2 side of him was at war with the half - @entity198 side			1
he was wildly jealous of the @entity5 , wanting to be @entity5 , wanting to be better at being @entity5 than the @entity5 were , while at the same time resenting them			0
’ as the @entity18 dragged on , @entity50 ’s influence with the military faded and he was reduced to handing out awards .			0

captain @entity0 was injured and captured in @entity37 in july , 1914
after two years in @entity2 camp his mother in @entity61 , @entity62 , fell ill
@entity208 wrote to the @entity6 asking to return home and enemy leader agreed
