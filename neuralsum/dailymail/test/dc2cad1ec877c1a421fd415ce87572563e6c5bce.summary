president @entity1 secretly granted the @entity2 an exemption relaxing restrictions on drone strikes in @entity6 after enacting more stringent rules in 2013 to reduce the risk of civilian casualties , it was revealed today			1
according to @entity10 , which first reported the story monday citing current and former government officials , @entity1 gave the spy agency a pass on providing proof that intended targets of drone strikes posed an imminent threat to the @entity20			1
had the @entity2 been subjected to the same stringent rules as other agencies , argues the article , the january drone strike that killed two hostages , one of them an @entity20 , could have been postponed or even prevented entirely			1
innocent victims : @entity28 hostages dr @entity29 ( left ) , a 73 - year - old economic adviser from the @entity20 , and 39 - year - old @entity32 aid worker @entity31 ( right ) were killed in a botched drone strike in january , which @entity20 officials say could have been postponed had it not been for a relaxed drone policy president @entity1 , seen here april 23 addressing the death of the two captives , reportedly has granted @entity2 a waiver exempting the agency from providing proof of imminent threat to the @entity20 ahead of planned drone strikes without @entity1 's waiver , @entity2 operatives would have been forced to gather additional information and surveillance data on the @entity28 - linked militants targeted in the january 15 strike , which may have delayed it , possibly sparing the lives of dr @entity29 , a 73 - year - old economic adviser from the @entity20 , and 39 - year - old @entity32 aid worker @entity31			1
the @entity2 was seeking to destroy an @entity28 compound in @entity6 when the two captives were killed , along with @entity55 , an @entity20 described as a leader of @entity28 in the @entity57			2
@entity28 's @entity59 spokesman , a @entity61 rocker - turned jihadist , @entity58 , died in a separate strike			0
@entity31 disappeared in january 2012 in @entity6 , just a few days into his second stint in the country			0
a native of @entity66 , @entity31 previously worked in @entity67 , the @entity68 and @entity69			0
@entity29 was snatched after gunmen tricked their way into his home in @entity73 on august 13 , 2011 shortly before he was due to return home after seven years working in @entity6			2
he later appeared in a video in which , under apparent coercion , he asked the @entity20 to free @entity28 prisoners			0
@entity29 's widow said in a statement that ‘ we are devastated by this news and the knowledge that my husband will never safely return home			0
’ president @entity1 last week publicly apologized for the hostage deaths and took ' full responsibility ' for all counter terrorism operations			1
several investigations into the botched drone strike , including by the @entity2 and @entity91 , are expected to take place in the coming months			1

earlier , president @entity1 took full responsibility for the counterterror missions and offered his ' grief and condolences ' @entity1 was quick to stress that ' we do believe that the operation did take out dangerous members of @entity28			1
' he also noted that january 15 strike was ' fully consistent with the guidelines under which we conduct counterterrorism efforts in the region			0
' since 9/11 , our counterterrorism efforts have prevented terrorist attacks and saved innocent lives both here in @entity20 , and around the world , ' the commander - in - chief said during a press conference thursday			0
@entity2 drone operations are broadly divided into two distinct categories : ' signature strikes ' and ' kill list ' strikes , according to the @entity10			1
the agency would go after specific targets if they are present on the kill list , but the president has to personally sign off on each such operation			2
signature strikes , however , can be carried out against any suspected enemy combatants and are not subjected to @entity1 's approval			2
according to the paper , in 2013 the president endorsed a set of restrictions aimed at eliminating ' signature strikes ' altogether in order to reduce the number of civilian deaths , but unnamed officials say many of the rules have yet to be implemented			1
despite @entity1 's defense of his counterterrorism record , congressional leaders rapidly called for more oversight over the drone program. , appearing on @entity152 ’s @entity151 sunday , @entity150 chairman @entity149 said drone strikes against suspected militants on foreign soil should be run by the @entity20 military and not the @entity2			1
pushing for reform : @entity150 chairman @entity149 said drone strikes against suspected militants on foreign soil should be run by the @entity20 military and not the @entity2 ‘ i think it was probably preventable , in that there was an obvious breakdown in intelligence			1
they did n't know that they were there , ’ @entity149 said of the january drone strike			1
the @entity168 senator and 2008 failed presidential candidate predicted the incident will renew a debate within the @entity1 administration on how the drone program is run			2
however , there still appeared to be strong support in @entity91 for employing the unmanned drones against enemy targets , which has expanded during the @entity1 administration			0
critics have long complained about civilians being killed in the air strikes			0
it is an ‘ integral part of the conflict and a very essential one , ’ @entity149 told @entity152			0
@entity149 acknowledged ‘ some bias ’ on which federal agency should operate the drone program , given that shifting it to the @entity188 from the @entity2 would put it under his purview as chairman of the @entity150 committee overseeing the military			1
nevertheless , @entity149 said the @entity188 had the expertise and , ‘ i think it should be conducted and oversight and administered by the @entity188			0
’ @entity29 is the seventh @entity20 to be killed by drones , the sixth who was hit inadvertently			2
in december @entity20 @entity198 and @entity200 @entity199 were both killed when @entity201 attempted to rescue them in @entity203			0
@entity1 said he ordered the raid because the 33 - year - old @entity205 was believed to be in ' imminent danger			0
' the president condemned @entity198 ' killing as a ' barbaric murder			0
' in 2013 , @entity1 defended @entity20 's controversial drone attacks as legal , effective and a necessary linchpin in an evolving @entity20 counterterrorism policy , saying , ' simply put , these strikes save lives			1
' but also acknowledged the targeted strikes are no ' cure - all ' and said he is haunted by the civilians unintentionally killed			0
since taking office , @entity1 's counterterrorism strategy has increasingly relied on the use of strikes by unmanned spy drones , particularly in @entity6 and @entity203			2
the highly secretive program has faced criticism from congressional lawmakers who have questioned its scope and legality			0
even though @entity2 drone strikes in @entity6 have steeply declined from a peak of around 128 in 2010 , according to the @entity231 , which tracks each strike reported by the media - there have been seven drone strikes in @entity6 so far this year , the group said .			1

@entity1 put in place *tougher* rules on drone strikes in 2013 to cut down on civilian deaths , but @entity2 got an exemption
president must sign off on drone strikes targeting suspects on ' kill list , ' but operations against other suspected militants do n't require his approval
@entity1 took ' full responsibility ' for january deaths of @entity20 hostage dr @entity29 and @entity32 aid worker @entity254 in drone strike
senator @entity149 on sunday said drone strikes against militants on foreign soil should be run by the @entity20 military and not the @entity2
