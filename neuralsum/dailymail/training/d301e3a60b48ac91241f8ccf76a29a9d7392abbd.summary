by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 18:00 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 18:39 est , 14 january 2014 the @entity4 lawmaker leading a new ' super committee ' into @entity6 and @entity7 today said he will turn the screw on other aides he suspects were involved in the affair or the cover - up			1
' the investigation will be broader than it started , ' general assembly deputy speaker @entity12 told @entity14 during an interview at the state capitol in @entity17 , just minutes before the governor delivered his annual state of the state address			1
' it is going to continue ' added @entity21 , the assembly 's newly minted speaker said after the speech			2
' public safety and abuse of power are our number one issues			0
but the @entity4 lawmaker said he does n't believe @entity6 's claim that he was in the dark when his aides closed off lanes leading to the @entity51 as payback to a @entity4 mayor who refused to endorse his re-election bid			1
@entity6 led off his annual speech by promising to cooperate with investigators			2
' without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again , ' he said			0
he fired one of his top aides , then - deputy chief of staff @entity64 , last week			1
@entity12 said he thinks it 's likely @entity6 's former chief of staff @entity36 – @entity64 ’s boss – knew as much about the shenanigans as she did			1
pressure 's on : @entity6 today said he would fully co-operate with investigators during his state of the state address asked if @entity36 might have been in the dark , @entity12 replied , ' it 's hard to imagine – you know , in any organization , you 've got somebody who reports to you and they 've done something improper , it 's hard to believe			1
' but ' we do n't know yes or no. ' @entity36 is @entity6 's current pick to be the next @entity41 attorney general , but the controversy has delayed his confirmation hearing because of the possibility that @entity12 's new committee could subpoena him			1
the transportation committee issued subpoenas of other officials last year , gathering thousands of pages of emails and text messages			0
among them were messages appearing to show @entity64 , the governor 's then - deputy chief of staff , conspiring with a @entity100 official to slow traffic in the town of @entity103			1
emails produced by subpoenas , @entity12 said , showed that ' the governor has shown a remarkable lack of curiosity in his questioning of his staff , and in his termination of @entity64			1
' suspicious : @entity12 said he was puzzled about how @entity6 could fire @entity64 without knowing what she had done he called it ' suspicious ' that @entity6 would fire her without a debriefing about her role in the scheme			2
' this man , as @entity1 attorney , did investigations before breakfast , ' the long - time lawmaker quipped			0
@entity6 ' was so incensed that he fires her , ' he asked , ' and his curiosity escapes him because he does n't sit down with her , or have somebody sit down with him , and say , " @entity64 , who told you to do this ? " ' ' we know that there was improper , potentially illegal behavior by a member of the governor 's staff , ' he said , referring to @entity64			1
' we know that there are people in the governor 's office that knew about it , and – to take the governor at his word – just filed it away and never said a word ? ' @entity6 appeared relaxed during his speech , but acknowledged that ' the last week has certainly tested this administration			2
' ' @entity144 were clearly made			0
and as a result , we let down the people we are entrusted to serve			0
' ' i know our citizens deserve better			0
much better , ' he said			0
‘ i am the governor and i am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch – both good and bad			0
' @entity12 promised that new subpoenas would be issued ' either thursday or friday , ' covering both @entity64 and @entity153 , a @entity6 political confidant who the governor said last week approached the wrongdoing with a grain of salt , putting his judgment into question			1
earlier subpoenas , he said , will be ' grandfathered in ' and still in force			0
man of the moment : @entity12 said subpoenas will be issued late r this week to more of @entity6 's staff the bridge scandal has produced more questions than answers so far , including uncertainty about gov. @entity6 's political future			1
while details of what his staffers and appointees were up to did n't emerge until after he was re-elected in november , the bridge lane closures first attracted widespread media attention in september			0
speculation has run rampant about why @entity41 @entity4 pols – including failed gubernatorial candidate @entity178 – did n't press the issue harder before the 2013 election			2
but however the political decision was made , @entity12 insisted , it was at the state level , and not influenced by national politicos invested in the 2016 presidential race			2
asked if @entity187 's camp , or those of @entity190 senators @entity191 or @entity192 , have been pressing him behind the scenes , he offered an unequivocal denial			0
' i have n't talked to anyone like that , ' he said			0

general assembly deputy speaker @entity12 said he finds it hard to believe that @entity6 's former chief of staff @entity36 was n't aware of @entity7
he adds that he finds it hardly *credible* that @entity6 did n't know either
@entity12 said @entity41 governor showed ' remarkable lack of curiosity ' when firing deputy chief of staff @entity64
