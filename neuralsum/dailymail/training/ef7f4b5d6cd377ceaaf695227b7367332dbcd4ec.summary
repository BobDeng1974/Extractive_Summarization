by @entity0 @entity1 : the shadow home secretary has revealed that she shouts at her husband @entity3 , the shadow chancellor , in the morning hurry up , we ’re going to be late ! where ’s your swimming kit ? and @entity3 , will you get off that piano ! that , according to an impeccable source , is the sound of a typical morning in the @entity3 household			1
in a revealing interview , @entity1 , the shadow home secretary , explains that husband @entity3 is not much help on the school run			1
and it ’s not because the shadow chancellor is preoccupied with the nation ’s finances			2
it seems his first priority of the day is his musical repertoire			2
miss @entity1 admitted she starts the morning by shouting at her husband because he is too busy playing the piano to help get the children ready			1
she revealed the chaos at the heart of family life in the high - flying couple ’s house and said her husband ’s timing for piano practice was ‘ infuriating ’ as it coincided with trying to round up their three children for school			1
‘ there ’s always that sort of morning chaos , ’ she said			1
‘ i think the most stressful time in any parent ’s day is that period between 8.20am and 8.40am			2
it ’s just … shouting			2
‘ you have n’t got them ready , you have n’t got yourself ready and then suddenly there ’s a discussion about @entity50 kit , or swimming			2
who knew it was swimming today ? ‘ and @entity3 has taken to piano practising during that period			0
it ’s infuriating , ’ she told the latest edition of @entity55			0
‘ so the shouting now includes shouting at the kids , shouting at myself and shouting at @entity3 because he is playing the piano – and why is he not helping to find the swimming kit ? ’ but miss @entity1 managed to get her own back by teasing her husband over the fact that she has achieved a higher piano grade than he has			1
mr @entity3 missed his grade 3 piano exam to respond to chancellor @entity67 ’s autumn statement			0
but miss @entity1 said : ‘ i just say i learned to @entity68			1
i do n’t actually put fingers to the keyboard to demonstrate how much i ’ve forgotten			0
’ @entity71 the ivories : balls at the piano			0
ms @entity1 said her husband 's timing for piano practice was ' infuriating ' despite his lack of help in the mornings , miss @entity1 conceded that her husband is the chef in the household while she resorts to ‘ ready meals or beans on toast ’			1
in a surprising admission , the usually no - nonsense miss @entity1 said she would love to appear on @entity85			1
‘ that would be wonderful , ’ she said but added : ‘ i ’m sure i ’d be hopeless			0
’ miss @entity1 also spoke of the challenge of keeping her children safe online , admitting they had to show her how to filter out porn			1
she said : ‘ let ’s be realistic			0
i have to ask my kids how to use the parental controls			0
‘ they are far more techno - savvy than i am			1
so the reality is they have to be resilient			0
’ on online porn , she said ‘ it ’s people ’s choice			0
the interesting thing , talking to teenagers , is how much of this is still as being about girls , when it should be about boys and girls			0
’ miss @entity1 also renewed her attack on @entity107 , saying he still had a ‘ women problem ’			1
she said @entity110 analysis showed that of the £ 14 billion in government cuts and pay and pension changes , £ 11 billion had come from women			0
‘ you have three - quarters of the money from women because the biggest cuts are in things like tax credits or child benefits , which are predominately paid to women , whereas things like the top - rate tax cut actually benefit more men			2
so i do n’t think it is any surprise that @entity107 has a women problem			0
