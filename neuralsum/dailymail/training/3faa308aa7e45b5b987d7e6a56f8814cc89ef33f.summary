sir @entity0 was no stranger to splashing the cash during his 26 years in the @entity3 hotseat and so the @entity4 is well - placed to assess @entity6 's summer signings			1
the former @entity8 manager sat down with sports presenter @entity9 for an exclusive interview on @entity11 about his life after retiring in 2013			1
casting an eye over the £ 150million worth of talent acquired by @entity15 , here @entity0 assesses each of @entity6 's new boys			1
the @entity8 broke the @entity34 transfer record to land @entity27 wideman @entity25 in a massive £ 60million deal and @entity0 believes big fees are part and parcel of modern day football			1
' that 's the way the game is going today with fees like £ 86m for @entity43 , ' said @entity0			1
' i think when you can identify ability like that needed by @entity6 , they have the resources to do that			2
they are fees i never quite equalled but nonetheless they were needing quite a big injection this year			1
' @entity25 cost @entity6 £ 60million when he arrived from @entity27 during the summer @entity18 former club : @entity55 fee : season - long loan @entity6 appearances : 4 @entity6 goals : 1 one of the most lethal strikers in world football , @entity18 's arrival - and the prospect of the @entity22 sta playing up front with @entity66 and @entity67 - certainly got @entity6 fans excited			1
however , having missed the @entity70 through injury and lacking fitness , @entity0 believes the club made the correct decision in loaning the @entity55 frontman rather than signing him permanently			1
' the big one is @entity18 who we 're all waiting to see			2
obviously , he has fantastic goalscoring ability			0
he had his injury so getting him on loan is the right thing to do , ' said the former @entity6 manager			2
@entity0 believes @entity6 made the right decision in loaning @entity18 following his recent injury @entity85 former club : @entity87 fee : £ 14million @entity6 appearances : 4 @entity6 goals : 0 @entity0 compared @entity91 to fellow midfielder @entity92 and believes the two players share a similar style			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity85 is one of those common - sense footballers that make up a team			0
he 's probably a version of @entity92 of a few years ago , that type of player			0
' he 's a good professional with common sense to his game			0
he keeps it simple and protects the defenders and the attacking midfield players in his role			0
' @entity85 is a good professional with common sense , according to former @entity6 boss @entity0 @entity109 former club : @entity111 fee : £ 29million @entity6 appearances : 4 @entity6 goals : 2 @entity0 is a big admirer of @entity109 and revealed the @entity117 midfielder had been on the radar for quite sometime before finally moving to @entity3 in the summer			1
' @entity109 played against us three years ago for @entity120 in the @entity121			0
in fairness , they gave us a right battering at @entity3 , ' said @entity0			0
' he 's a talented young player and we scouted him quite a lot at that time			0
obviously i think they tried to get him last year but it fell through for some reason or another			0
' he 's athletic , quite aggressive actually for a lad who has not got a great frame and he 's quite slim but he 's quite aggressive and he gets around the pitch			0
' @entity109 , here celebrating scoring against @entity133 , had long been on the @entity6 radar before signing @entity136 former club : @entity138 fee : £ 30million @entity6 appearances : 2 @entity6 goals : 0 @entity6 attempted to sign left back @entity136 long before the youngster made his @entity144 debut for @entity138			1
the 19 - year - old , who played in @entity147 's final group game at the @entity70 , became the most expensive teenager when he eventually signed for @entity6 in a £ 31m deal shortly after the summer tournament in @entity151			2
' the signing of @entity136 was the one we tried to get when he was 16 years of age , ' said @entity0			1
' they would n't sell him to us but they always said we 'd be first to know if they ever did			0
' ' of course , @entity159 has carried that through and we got him for , i think it was £ 30m			0
he 's a talented boy , a good footballer who likes to get forward all the time			0
' @entity6 attempted to sign left back @entity136 from @entity138 when he was just 16 years old @entity163 former club : @entity165 fee : £ 16million @entity6 appearances : 4 @entity6 goals : 0 @entity169 defender @entity163 , 24 , impressed @entity0 during the @entity70 and can play in a number of position across the backline			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity163 , the @entity174 boy , i watched him at the @entity70 , i thought he did really well for them and i think he 's capable of playing either left side as a wing back if you like or as a centre back			2
' like our @entity6 facebook page			0
@entity163 impressed @entity0 during the @entity70 and here gives @entity133 's @entity183 no peace @entity185 one of the world 's top four - @entity187			2

sir @entity0 took part in an exclusive interview for @entity11
the former @entity6 boss believes the club were right to loan @entity18 following the striker 's recent injury
@entity0 admitted @entity6 needed a ' big injection ' when discussing @entity25 's £ 60million switch from @entity27
he also says @entity6 wee *interested* in signing @entity136 when he was 16
