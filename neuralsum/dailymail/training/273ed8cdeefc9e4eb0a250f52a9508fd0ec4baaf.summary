by @entity0 published : 00:31 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 20:59 est , 5 december 2012 when @entity2 advertised his 21st birthday party on @entity4 , he hoped to attract a couple of hundred friends at most			1
inspired by a @entity8 film in which an unpopular student throws open his parents ’ home to all - comers , he promised a night never to forget			1
unfortunately for his neighbours , that ’s exactly what they got			0
happy birthday : @entity2 , left , said seeing @entity18 at his party was ' crazy ' and said the event was the ' best night ever ' more than 1,000 revellers – including @entity24 ’s @entity23 judge @entity18 – packed into his parents ’ garden before spilling out into the street			1
but while the party - goers in the village of @entity29 , @entity30 , had a good time , neighbours were less impressed			1
police were called amid reports of thefts , smashed cars and fighting			0
they launched a major operation , which included closing a nearby road because of congestion caused by the number of cars arriving			0
out of control : revellers turned up from as far away as @entity44 to the party in @entity46 party : more than 1,000 people crowded into the @entity2 's street after he advertised his birthday on @entity4 chaos : @entity52 complained to police when the party , pictured , began to spiral out of control packed : @entity2 said he expected about 200 people to turn up and was left shocked when five times that many arrived they finally halted the party at 11pm , three hours after it started			1
@entity2 – whose parents were away in @entity62 – is now counting the cost after he was charged with causing a public nuisance			1
the day after the night before : the scene after the house party where @entity2 held his 21st and over 1,000 people turned up he admitted the offence at @entity69 and was given a community order under which he must serve an eight - week curfew between 8pm and 6am			1
he was also ordered to pay £ 500 compensation to @entity73 and £ 85 costs			1
the court heard the computer engineer admitted the party , which his brother @entity78 , 18 , also attended , had got ‘ way out of hand ’			2
but he dismissed concerns after the court appearance , hailing it ‘ the best night ever ’			2
‘ it was a really good atmosphere			0
no one was getting into any trouble , ’ he said			0
‘ at first when all these strangers showed up me and my brother were a bit worried			0
but everyone was really chilled out and it was really fun so we started having a good time			0
‘ it was crazy when @entity18 showed up			1
she said thanks for letting her come and told me it was a great party			2
she said she could n’t believe how many people were there			2
’ @entity2 added his parents @entity99 , 49 , who works for @entity101 , and father @entity102 , 52 , a salesman , gave their blessing for the event so long as any mess was ‘ kept outside ’			1
we filled about 20 bin liners with rubbish and did about five trips to the tip , ’ he said			0
the party was called @entity112 in a reference to the film @entity114 about a teenager who throws a party to boost his popularity			2
word of the event spread like wildfire as information was passed around on social networking sites and strangers from as far afield as @entity44 turned up			2
a spokesman for @entity125 , who lives in nearby @entity126 , said : ‘ when she got there she realised it was not the sort of party she wanted to be at and left			0
’ one of @entity2 ’s neighbours , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ i felt like a prisoner in my own home			1
i was scared to go out			0
i ’m amazed his parents were happy to go abroad knowing what he planned			0
’ he also had the bare - faced cheek to pull a moonie taking some responsibility it appears that a pond or swimming pool has been cordoned off			0

@entity24 's @entity23 judge turned up to say happy birthday to friend of the family @entity2
the 21 - year - old advertised party on @entity4 and @entity151 and was *swamped* by 1,000 people
@entity2 ordered to pay £ 500 compensation after admitting public nuisance charge on friday
said it was ' crazy ' when @entity18 arrived and had the ' best night ever '
