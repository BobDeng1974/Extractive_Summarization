by @entity0 the coalition is overseeing the biggest reduction in @entity5 ’s vast public sector workforce for half a century , and will have slashed one in five jobs by the time austerity is due to come to an end , a report says today			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) says employment by the state will fall by 1.1 million , or 19 per cent , by 2018 - 19 compared with when @entity13 entered the @entity14 in 2010			1
but in a significant endorsement of the government ’s plan to rebalance the economy in favour of the private sector , it concludes that a ‘ buoyant ’ jobs market means that thus far firms in in every region have created more positions than public employment has fallen			1
the share of the workforce employment by the state is already at its lowest level for at least 40 years , with 5.4 million employees or just under 20 per cent , the @entity10 says			2
further planned cuts will mean the figure falling to just 14.8 per cent , a ‘ dramatic change ’ in the nature of the @entity5 labour market			0
when @entity36 lost the 2010 general election , the public sector employed about 6.1 million workers , with their pay bill accounting for well over half of day - to - day government spending			1
critics accuse @entity43 of seeking to create a ‘ client ’ state , with more and more people dependent on the government for employment or benefits			0
today ’s report says if the forecast of a 1.1 million fall in public sector employment by 2018 - 19 is delivered , it would dwarf the fall of 350,000 seen in the 1990s and more than undo the increase of over 600,000 seen under @entity36 during the 2000s			1
however , it warns of significant challenges to the government ’s plans – saying savage cutbacks in other areas will be required if it maintains existing protections for the @entity65 and schools			2
already 57 per cent of public sector workers are employed in these two sectors , up from 42 per cent in 1991			1
this proportion could reach over 70 per cent by 2018 if education and health continue to protected from future workforce cuts			0
the report says delivering the planned cuts without reducing the numbers working in health and education will be ‘ very challenging ’			0
if there continue to be reductions to the education and @entity65 workforces between now and 2018 , the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by 40 per cent , from 2.2 to 1.3 million			0
even if the education and the @entity65 workforces were reduced by 200,000 over the next five years - a fall of six per cent - the reductions in other areas of general government employment would still need to be about 30 per cent			2
the report also says that women now make up two - thirds of the public sector workforce , a proportion which will continue to grow - mainly since women are more likely than men to work in areas where the budget is being protected from cuts , such as health and education			1
it also reveals a dramatic variation in the dependence of different regions and countries of the @entity5 on the public sector for jobs			2
if there continue to be reductions to the education and @entity65 workforces between now and 2018 , the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by 40 per cent , from 2.2 to 1.3 million			0
in inner @entity110 , 23 per cent of people are employed by the state , compared to 34 per cent in @entity112 and 36 per cent in @entity113			0
the public sector workforce is also still dominant in areas of rural @entity116 and @entity117 , and the smallest in areas of rural @entity119 and the @entity120			2
@entity121 , research economist at @entity10 and an author of the report , said : ‘ the public sector workforce grew by over 600,000 over the 2000s			1
' even so the scale of the reductions expected over the next few years looks challenging			0
if delivered , the 1.1 million drop in general government employment … between 2010 – 11 and 2018 – 19 would be almost three times larger than the previous drop during the early 1990s			0
‘ the workforce is a useful prism through which to look at the effects of cutting total spending whilst protecting the @entity65 and schools budgets from cuts			0
' with limited falls in the health and education workforces the number of public sector workers in other areas could fall by 30 - 40 % over the next five years			1

@entity10 says from 2010 - 19 state jobs will fall by 19 %
buoyant jobs market means private sector is creating more positions
57 % of public sector workers are in schools and the @entity65
