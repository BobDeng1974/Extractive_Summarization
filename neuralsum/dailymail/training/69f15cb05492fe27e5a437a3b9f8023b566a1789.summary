sticker shock is around the corner for many @entity2 with government - brokered medical coverage , as insurance companies are beginning to apply their first - year costs to next year 's premiums			1
in the case of @entity9 , some consumers will pay as much as 23 per cent more when their plans are renewed in the fall , according to the @entity9 @entity12			2
when that agency released its projections on monday , 23 per cent was the upper end of the bad news			0
but some consumers in the @entity9 could see their premiums drop by 5 per cent instead			2
that 's because many insurance companies have been controlling costs by limiting the number of doctors , hospitals and prescription drugs their plans will cover in 2015			1
who so serious ? president @entity27 signed a bill on tuesday funding @entity31 's @entity30 defense shield as news emerged that his @entity34 program is getting more expensive for consumers the average in @entity9 will come out to a 13.2 per cent hike			1
the numbers in virtually every state are all across the board , with the biggest rate hikes announced to date coming in states where the federal government runs the @entity34 marketplaces			1
states like @entity46 , which runs its own exchange , appear to be escaping with more modest increases for 2015			1
its regulators have announced a 4.2 per cent ' weighted average ' hike			2
that percentage itself could be hiding a spread of rate increases and decreases similar to @entity9 's			1
covered @entity46 , the state 's @entity34 exchange , said on july 31 that 13 per cent of the state 's consumers would see hikes of 8 per cent ' or more ' next year			1
the @entity62 reported that some rates in @entity64 are expected to rise by 16 per cent			0
but the worst news in @entity46 is yet to come : @entity66 , the state 's insurance commissioner , said current numbers are ' merely a pause in the double - digit rate increases we 've seen historically			1
' in november voters will consider @entity73 45 , a measure that would expand @entity66 's authority to set insurance rates			1
insurers , @entity66 told the @entity62 , may be holding rates down in anticipation of the new system , provided it passes			2
complicating things further is a recent ruling from the @entity82 in @entity83 that found it 's illegal for the government to extend health insurance subsidies to consumers in states that did n't set up their own exchanges			1
if the decision stands , people in 36 states would likely see their out - of - pocket expenses skyrocket			1
the subsidies amount to as much as $ 450 per month in some states like @entity96 and @entity97			1
residents of @entity99 and @entity100 would lose the least , an average of about $ 150 per month			0
a separate court ruled the same day that those subsidies are constitutional			0
the @entity27 administration is appealing the ruling it disagrees with			0
any increase , no matter how modest , will likely bring catcalls from conservatives and other @entity109			0
ten months ago , @entity27 stood in the @entity110 and promised that @entity34 , then in mid-website - meltdown , would sort out okay for @entity2 president @entity27 promised @entity2 during his 2008 presidential campaign – and long afterward – that his @entity34 law would bring health care savings of $ 2,500 per family each year , on average , by the end of his first term in office			2
he also promised on dozens of occasions that @entity2 could ' keep their health care plans ' if they wanted to			0
that promise quickly vanished as insurers sent millions of cancellation notices since existing plans often did n't conform to the lengthy and byzantine collection of mandatory benefits @entity128 decided every @entity2 must have			0
those requirements , as much as any other factor , have driven up costs			0
some opinion - shapers are beginning to dissect the reasons for rate hikes , and new taxes are part of the picture			1
@entity34 will ' result in insurance plans being taxed more than $ 100 billion between 2014 and 2022 , ' the right - leaning @entity139 editorial board wrote on july 23 , ' with the @entity142 concluding that the taxes " would be largely passed through to consumers in the form of higher premiums for private coverage "			2
' the @entity139 has called for a complete repeal of the law			0
in a @entity150 poll released july 23 , twice as many @entity2 say the law has hurt them compared with those who say it helped			0
' thirty - five percent of @entity2 told pollsters that @entity34 has made them and their families worse off			0
just 18 percent believe they are better off			0
forty - six percent , almost half of @entity2 , say the law has made no difference in their lives .			0

rate hikes will vary from state to state next year , with @entity9 appearing *hardest* - hit so far
many insurers with more modest increases have been keeping rates down by limiting which doctors , hospitals and prescription drugs are covered
@entity46 could see rates skyrocket if voters approve new authority for the insurance commissioner in november
a federal court ruling , if it stands , would hike monthly costs by as much as $ 450 because the federal government would no longer be able to subsidize rates in 36 states
