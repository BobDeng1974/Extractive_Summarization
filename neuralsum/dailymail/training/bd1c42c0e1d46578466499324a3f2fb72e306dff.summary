@entity0 was said to be devastated on saturday over his sacking as one - day captain just two months before the @entity2 but @entity3 insist he simply is not worth his place in the one - day team any longer			1
@entity3 wielded the axe in ruthless fashion on the man they have put such faith in at the end of a dismal seven - match tour of @entity12 where his highest score was just 34			1
now they have turned to @entity14 , himself in worse form than @entity0 during 2014 , to somehow spearhead a challenge for a @entity2 in @entity17 and @entity18 that @entity3 will start as rank outsiders			1
the man who was charged with leading @entity3 ’s new era in the bitter fall - out of their @entity38 shambles was unceremoniously dumped even though there were repeated public reassurances that he would take them to the @entity2			1
the scale of his feeling was revealed in the @entity44 ’s confirmation of the news on saturday that broke on friday when @entity0 said : ‘ i am gutted to be left out of the @entity2 squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment			1
that said i wish @entity51 , @entity14 and the lads all the best for the @entity2			2
i would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me as one - day captain			1
’ there was no attempt to mask the extent of the blow to @entity0 at @entity60 on saturday from the men who have backed him but now sacked him			1
‘ of course he ’s upset , ’ said @entity29 , who only on monday had said he would be ‘ very surprised ’ if @entity3 had a new captain for the @entity2			1
‘ gutted was the word he used			0
he had a dream to lead @entity3 at the @entity2 and it ’s been taken away from him a month from its fulfilment			2
@entity0 admitted he was ' gutted ' to be left out of the @entity2 squad @entity14 described his appointment as a ' huge honour ' but has plenty of work to do snatching @entity0 's captaincy away was not a brave decision ... the selectors should be red - faced ‘ he still believes he ’s the right man for the job but the selectors had to make a decision in the best interests of @entity77 cricket			1
he ’s very raw and of course it ’s a blow to have the captaincy taken away from you			0
‘ he ’s hugely , hugely disappointed but hopefully in time he will reflect that he was n’t scoring runs and he was putting himself under an awful lot of pressure			0
we want him to free up his mind and focus on test cricket which is what he does best anyway			0
i hope he ’ll come round to thinking this is the best thing for him and @entity77 cricket and will get back to scoring centuries in @entity87 matches			1
’ @entity29 , who has endured a turbulent first year in office at the head of @entity3 cricket , sat in on friday ’s long selection meeting but was adamant that a decision which was shocking in its timing was made only by the selectors			1
‘ we had to have a full discussion and weigh up current and historical form , ’ said @entity20 , who made the decision on friday with fellow selectors @entity99 and @entity101 as well as coach @entity51			2
‘ everything went into the discussion and we gave it our full attention for a number of hours			0
it was a long meeting but it was felt unanimously that we had to change because @entity0 was no longer in the sort of form he is capable of			1
he was n’t in our best 15			0
’ @entity0 looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final odi of the series against @entity12 @entity20 insisted that the selectors were happy with the presence of the man who is in effect their boss at their meeting			2
‘ we ’re perfectly comfortable with it			0
i feel we ’ve got a group of integral people on the selection panel who will give honest opinions regardless of whether @entity29 ’s there or not			0
we speak our minds in front of him just the same as if he was n’t there			0
we appreciate his input when we ask him for it			0
’ the statistics might suggest that @entity0 is no longer worth his place in the side but such has been the level of support for @entity0 that the timing of his one - day demise must be an acute embarrassment			1
not so , says @entity29			0
‘ embarrassment does n’t come into this , ’ he insisted			0
‘ this is not about personalities			0
it is always about what ’s best for @entity77 cricket			1
‘ it was very clear to my mind and others that @entity0 during the test summer was absolutely the captain to back			1
it ’s always been more debatable in one - day cricket			1
it ’s not about embarrassment			0
it ’s about looking at the facts and doing what ’s right , or what we hope is right			0
’ @entity0 plays and misses at one in @entity158 during another stuttering innings @entity160 told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch @entity0 but less than a week ago you were backing @entity0 to the hilt ? ‘ my job in this role is to support our team and our captain , ’ said @entity29			1
‘ we had one game left to play when i said that and we could n’t predict the outcome so for me to be questioning @entity0 going into the last game would have been wrong			2
‘ but plans have to change if they ’re not working and while it was n’t my decision i completely endorse what the selectors have done because i think it gives us the best chance going into the @entity2			0
’ @entity14 is a good friend of @entity180 and the @entity3 outcast was quick to tweet on friday that he hoped he could play under him			1
but clearly there is no chance of that happening			0
‘ no , no , no , ’ said whitaker when asked whether this move opens the door to @entity180			0
‘ the @entity44 management made this decision in january and it is the same decision now			2
there is no way that @entity180 will ever get back into an @entity3 team			2
he ’s no longer part of @entity3 cricket			2
’ @entity12 's @entity195 ( right ) celebrates with @entity196 after taking the wicket of @entity0 and @entity29 added : ‘ we parted company with @entity180 in january because throughout the @entity44 management , from the dressing room up to the board , it was felt that it was the right decision to go in a slightly different direction			1
‘ if anything more bridges have been burnt by @entity180 ’s book			0
there is no interest from our point of view in going backwards			0
we ’ve got an exciting group of young players and @entity14 ’s excited to be working with those guys			2
he wants to fulfil that team ’s potential			0
’ the odds , though , have to be against @entity14 breaking @entity3 ’s long @entity2 duck with a squad , revealed in its entirety by saturday 's @entity221 , that includes the recalled @entity222 but not @entity223 , who was left out after his own miserable run of form			1
@entity226 understands @entity227 was considered before @entity3 plumped for @entity14 and @entity20 added : ‘ @entity14 has had captaincy experience and when he has captained @entity3 it ’s generally brought the best out of him			1
‘ it ’s our feeling that the characteristic of his leadership style coupled with his determination will help galvanise the one - day team and set a course for us through the @entity2			1
we help he sets a course in one - day cricket that will be very positive			1
he ’s got a lot of qualities			0
his form was talked about and reviewed , as everybody ’s is , but we felt he could be stimulated by this			0
we feel he ’s the right man to take us forward			0
’ @entity3 supporters can only cross their fingers and hope that he is right			2
