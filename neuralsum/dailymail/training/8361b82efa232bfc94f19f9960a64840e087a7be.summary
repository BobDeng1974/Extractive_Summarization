by @entity0 for @entity1 a retired music teacher has built a custom - made £ 20,000 garden shed at the bottom of her lawn to house her very own church organ			1
@entity7 , 66 , bought the 424 - pipe @entity9 instrument from a church 20 years ago for just £ 500 after they wanted to clear room for renovations			1
she spent thousands transporting the ten - foot - tall organ and another £ 20,000 building a special sound - proof shed at the end of the lawn at her detached home			1
and mrs @entity7 insists its unusual location not only helps her play better but also keeps her pet hens happy and does n't disturb the neighbours			1
she said : ' i really am very lucky to have it - it is a beautiful instrument			1
' it is a bit unusual to have a huge church organ at the bottom of your garden where most people keep the garden tools			2
' i think most people think i 'm a fruit and nut case to be honest but i do n't mind			0
' i love my organ			2
the dogs like the music , and the hens like it too - i reckon it makes them lay more eggs			2
' taking it down : @entity57 in @entity58 decided to get rid of its organ in 1995 ( pictured ) enormous effort : here , workers are seen intricately dismantling each pipe and board and loading it into a van a lifelong musician from @entity66 in @entity23 , widowed mrs @entity7 bought the organ from @entity57 , in @entity58 , in 1995			1
the clergy wanted to sell it to make room to install meeting rooms after the stunning wooden and metal instrument was abandoned in favour of more portable instruments			0
the 1881 eight stopper organ with two keyboards was made by the esteemed ' @entity78 ' @entity77 - the man behind the organs at @entity80 and the @entity81			2
but incredibly the church accepted mrs @entity7 's offer of £ 500 for the instrument - despite later receiving a £ 20,000 offer from @entity86			1
she hired specialists to dismantle and reassemble the air - powered instrument and after realising it would not fit in her living room decided to built a huge garden shed			1
council planners gave her permission for the structure after visiting her remote home - and making her promise not to play before 8am and after 11pm			0
pride and joy : now mrs @entity7 can play the grand instrument to her heart 's content at the end of her garden mrs @entity7 , who is director of music at her local church , said : ' i was so lucky to get the organ for that price , and it was very good of the church to honour their agreement with me			1
' it balances beautifully because it is built by such a genius			0
you pull out one stop and whatever you pull out on top of it to add colour it still balances			0
' i had to put it in storage while the room was built			0
it was quite a thing - the roof had to be specially built and 20 men had to lift the huge metal girder in to support the roof			0
' it does n't disturb anyone when i play because the shed really is sound proof			0
' and it 's also not that loud			0
if you pulled out every stop on the organ and played it together it would be very loud , but you do n't do that			0
' the organ has a range of wooden and metal pipes helping it to create a whole orchestra of sounds - including flutes , trumpets and strings			2
each stop - the component which lets pressurized air into a set of pipes - is insured for £ 9,000 , making the organ worth £ 72,000 .			1
