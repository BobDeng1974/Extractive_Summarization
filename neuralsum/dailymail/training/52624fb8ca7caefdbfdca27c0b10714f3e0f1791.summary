misfiring strikers @entity0 and @entity2 need ' just one break ' in front of goal to kick - start @entity7 's season , according to @entity8			1
@entity7 eased to a 1 - 0 @entity10 second - round victory at @entity11 on tuesday - but only courtesy of @entity13 's own goal			1
@entity7 's entire squad have drawn blanks in the first three matches of the new campaign , leaving @entity8 admitting his @entity19 stars must quickly sharpen up			1
off target : @entity7 's summer striker signings @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 are yet to yield a goal for @entity8 's side after three games this season optimism : @entity7 manager @entity8 says his strikers ' just need one break ' chance will come : @entity8 has put faith in @entity0 with the @entity30 starting both @entity32 games the @entity35 club 's boss believes his new forwards will need a crucial slice of finishing fortune to see off @entity39 in saturday 's home @entity32 clash			1
' i just think we 've shown real solid team performances in the three matches so far , without really getting a break in front of goal , ' said @entity8			1
' so many times we could have got a break tonight and we could have got a second or third goal and it did n't happen for us			2
' i 'm hoping to get a break on saturday , we just need one break			2
' it would be nice to score two or more goals on saturday			2
' the way @entity39 play , how quick they are on the break , you sense that they could score , so it might mean we do need to get two or three goals so that 's what our focus must be			1
' @entity62 side @entity11 never threatened @entity7 's chances of coasting to victory at @entity65 , the hosts also toothless in front of goal			1
@entity8 admitted relief at victory but slight frustrations at his side 's lack of cohesion			1
hard luck : @entity13 gets the last touch for @entity7 to score @entity11 's fourth own goal in six games summer signing @entity79 was unable to forge a flowing partnership with @entity0 , despite lively showings from @entity83 and full debutant @entity84			1
' the scoreline did n't really reflect our dominance , ' said @entity8			2
' i 've been here many times as a manager			0
i 've played here , and done a lot of scouting here too			2
' it 's a very , very difficult place to come			2
and yet we controlled the game more or less all the way through			0
' i 'm pleased but a bit frustrated we did n't score more than the one			0
' they gave up a lot of space in midfield to play that extra centre - half			0
it was difficult to penetrate their three centre - halves			0
' but i ca n't be too disappointed , i thought our application to the game was great			0
our two centre - halves typified that , particularly the skipper			0
enough to win : @entity83 ( 25 ) celebrates the goal his dangerous cross can be credited for creating ' absolute respect we showed @entity11 tonight , and that 's how you get wins at places like this			1
' @entity11 boss @entity121 was at a loss to find reason for his side 's fourth own goal in six matches of the embryonic season			1
' it 's absolutely amazing ; incredible , ' said @entity121 of @entity11 's own - goal glut			1
' that 's the way it goes , hopefully there will be no more			0
' it 's a little unlucky on @entity13 , and being a @entity135 boy as well			2
' he 's got a great head on him , so he 'll be fine			0
' i do n't think it 's anything we 're doing wrong			0
' there 's nothing we 're doing to encourage that , it 's just one of those things			0
' the only thing i 'm disappointed with is that we did n't have 90 minutes ' belief			0
' it 's not too late to play @entity149 … there 's £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			0

@entity156 's first goal of the season came via the boot of @entity159 ' @entity13
