by @entity0 when it comes to women 's clothing sizes , there 's some funny math going on			2
the average @entity7 woman is about 25 pounds heavier than she was in 1960			1
yet women 's plus - size clothing , generally defined as size 14 and up , still makes up only about 9per cent of the $ 190billion spent annually on clothes			1
what 's wrong with this equation ? it 's not that plus - size women are n't into fashion			1
rather , the fashion industry does n't seem interested in them			0
the fashion industry has long spent more time , money and marketing on clothing for taut bodies than for curvier ones because it 's easier and more profitable to do so			2
inspiring : @entity26 , which sells trendy clothing in sizes 1 through 16 , last summer featured plus - size model @entity29 , who is a size 12 or 14 , in its swimsuit ads but retail analysts and plus - size women say there 's something else at play : stereotypes about larger women not wanting to dress fashionably keep companies from making clothes that are flattering to them			1
and in turn , that discourages them from spending more			0
' there is still an interesting stigma attached to plus - size fashion and the woman who wears it , ' says @entity50 , who wears a size 16 and studies the industry via her website @entity54			1
' many think ' oh , she does n't want to draw attention , live life , date , be confident , wear fitted clothes with bold colors and patterns , ' when the exact opposite is true			2
' @entity62 , 32 , says that attitude has resulted in fewer plus - size options			1
@entity65 , who wears around a size 22 , lamented recently after a day of shopping at @entity68 , @entity69 and other stores that she sometimes ca n't even find decent plus - size clothing at retailers that specialize in it			1
' it was a hot , annoying day , and i spent it trying on stuff , and came up with nothing , ' @entity65 , who works in human resources , says			2
' there 's this aversion to being associated with plus - size clothes			1
' to be sure , sizing is an inexact science			0
women 's sizes were developed in the 1920s as catalogues became popular and ready - to - wear clothing replaced tailor made or self - sewn items			2
' there is still an interesting stigma attached to plus - size fashion and the woman who wears it ' but while a system of men 's standard sizing based on chest sizes in the @entity102 had worked well , a similar attempt to base women 's sizes on bust measurements was n't as reliable			1
women 's bust sizes are more variable			0
in the 1930s , retailers began adopting even - numbered sizes commonly ranging from 14 to 24 , says @entity111 , a dressmaker who studies costume history			2
but those sizes bore little resemblance to those used today — a size 24 back then , for instance , would be a size 14 today — so the issues of not having enough plus - size fashions likely was not as pronounced			1
the sizes stayed the same but the numbers decreased gradually , @entity111 says , about 1 size a decade			2
this is known as ' vanity sizing ' because it gives women the allusion that they 're fitting into a smaller size			2
women 's sizes , which today range from 0 to 24 but vary from store to store , have n't evolved much for decades			0
and for the most part , neither have the range of plus - size fashions			1
as a result , the amount spent on women 's plus - size clothing annually has only risen by one percentage point to 9 percent since 2011 , the furthest back plus - size data available from research firm @entity140			1
helping hand : fashion retailer @entity147 hired an expert to guide its designers in making larger sizes ' if the offering becomes stronger , women will spend more , ' says @entity153 , a retail strategist at consulting firm @entity154			0
' there 's a significant dollar opportunity in what is currently a very depressed apparel segment that retailers should be looking to exploit			0
' some retailers have started to do just that			0
@entity26 , a @entity162 - based retailer that sells trendy clothing in the @entity7 equivalent of sizes 1 through 16 , last summer featured plus - size model @entity29 , who is a size 12 or 14 , in its swimsuit ads. ' our aim is not to convey a certain message or show an ideal , but to have a campaign which can illustrate the collection in an inspiring and clear way , ' said @entity175 , an @entity26 spokeswoman			1
' if the offering becomes stronger , women will spend more			0
there 's a significant dollar opportunity that retailers should be looking to exploit ' @entity69 , a plus size retailer , said earlier this month that it is expanding into higher - end designer clothing			1
it will debut its first designer collaboration with @entity183 and @entity184 on a collection of holiday clothes and later a spring line			2
' this is a big deal for us and we 're treating it in that manner in every way we can , ' said @entity192 , @entity69 's ceo			0
and online retailer @entity193 three years ago launched a plus - size category called @entity195 with sizes 14 to 24			1
the company fits everything on a size 16 model to ' ensure we are offering the right fit and comfort to our customers , ' says @entity203 , an @entity195 buyer			2
the company would n't disclose sales figures but said they 've been stronger each season			0
' our customer comes in all shapes and sizes and our range should reflect that , ' @entity203 says			0
but for every chain adding to their plus - size offerings , there are many others that continue to cater to smaller sizes			1
@entity220 , for instance , has been criticized for only offering sizes 0 to 10 and its ceo 's comments that the chain caters to ' cool ' and ' attractive ' kids			0
the company says it is an ' aspirational brand ' which targets a ' particular segment of customers			0
' the comments received widespread backlash online and @entity232 has since begun anti-bullying initiatives			0
but it has not begun offering bigger sizes			0
sellout success : @entity239 's first ' fatkini ' collection in sizes 10 to 24 for @entity241 , sold out within hours of going on sale in may - to the frustration of thousands of eager fans whether to carry plus - size clothing is a risk calculation for most retailers , said @entity248 , a vice president for the @entity249			1
' most retailers ca n't afford to fit everybody , ' he says			0
indeed , @entity252 , founder of @entity253 , a new high - end line of women 's clothing ranging from size 12 to 22 , agrees that it 's a tough choice for retailers			2
the @entity253 line offers plus - size skirts for $ 250 and jackets for $ 650			1
but @entity252 acknowledges that designer clothes for plus - sizes can be more complex than smaller sizes			2
' you ca n't just take a size 6 and upsize it for ( a size ) 20 and expect it to work , ' she says			0
that 's a challenge @entity147 , an online clothing retailer that sells clothes by indie designers , faced when it decided to start offering plus sizes			2
@entity147 regularly works with 1,500 designers , but none of them offered plus sizes , says @entity277 , a category manager at the @entity279 - based retailer			0
' plus - size consumers are hungry for more options , unique options , not just same thing off the rack ' ' more times than not , they were excited about entering the space but ... extremely inexperienced , ' she says			1
but , she added that ' they did n't have plus size knowledge or expertise			0
' after @entity147 hired an expert to help the designers learn how to make larger sizes , the retailer started selling plus sizes a year ago and officially launched the category in june			0
now , more than 100 vendors offer plus sizes and @entity147 's sales of plus - size items have quadrupled within the year			1
' the plus - size customer definitely feels excluded in many areas of the fashion industry , ' says @entity277			1
that customer has been gaining a voice on social media lately			0
@entity304 , who wears around a size 24 , started a weight loss and plus - size fashion blog @entity308 , in 2009			1
' the blogging world is helping open up people 's eyes to what is available and what is n't available , ' she says			0
another popular plus - size blogger , @entity314 , collaborated this summer with swimsuit designer @entity315 on a swimsuit line — typically an underserved category for plus sizes			1
the two - piece suits , nicknamed the ' fatkini , ' with colorful designs such as a starry galaxy print , sold out quickly after it launched			0
' plus - size consumers are hungry for more options , unique options , not just same thing off the rack , ' @entity323 says			1
' i hope retailers that have not gone into plus sizes realize we have the same amount of disposable income just like every other shopper			0

the average @entity7 woman is about 25lbs heavier than she was in 1960 . yet plus - size clothing still makes up only about 9per cent of the $ 190billion spent annually on clothes
