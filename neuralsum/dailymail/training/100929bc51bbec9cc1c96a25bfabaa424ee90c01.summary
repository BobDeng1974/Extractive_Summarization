@entity0 was released from house arrest in @entity2 yesterday as the sexual assault case against him teetered on the verge of collapse			0
a dramatic court hearing in @entity7 saw the @entity9 former head of the @entity10 given back his £ 3.7million bail money			1
a security tag on his ankle was also removed			0
prosecutors admitted there were ‘ serious credibility issues ’ with his accuser , a maid who said he tried to rape her in may at the @entity7 hotel where she worked			1
all smiles : the credibility of the witness led to @entity0 being released from house arrest law enforcement officials believe the 32 - year - old @entity27 immigrant has repeatedly lied to them and may have links to drug dealing and money laundering			1
assistant district attorney @entity31 told the court : ‘ it ’s clear that the strength of this case has been affected by substantial credibility issues with the witness			0
’ @entity0 , 62 , who denies attempted rape and serious sexual assault , left the court smiling and with his arm around his wife , @entity42 , after a judge lifted his stringent bail conditions			0
he had been held in a @entity7 house under armed guard			0
judge @entity47 acknowledged that the risk of @entity0 absconding ‘ had receded quite a bit ’ but said he was ‘ in no rush to judgment ’ on the case			0
the charges have not yet been dismissed and the court will hold on to @entity0 ’s passport			1
but , in a stunning reversal in the case , the spotlight has shifted to his accuser			0
she claims @entity0 subjected her to a vicious sex attack when she came to clean his suite at the @entity64 hotel , telling investigators he was naked and chased her across the room			0
forensic tests have revealed the pair definitely had a sexual encounter , but defence lawyers have claimed it was consensual			1
while public opinion has so far weighed heavily against @entity0 , who has a reputation as an aggressive womaniser , the maid ’s lawyer had portrayed her as a hard - working single mother and devout muslim			1
but according to law enforcement officials who spoke to the @entity81 , that image appears to be very far from the truth			0
two official sources said the unnamed woman spoke on the telephone to an imprisoned alleged drug dealer within a day of her encounter with @entity0			1
in the conversation , which was recorded , she reportedly discussed the possible benefits of pursuing the charges against @entity0			1
investigators also say they learnt that the man on the other end of the phone , who is accused of possessing 400lb of marijuana , is among several people who put cash deposits amounting to more than £ 62,000 into the maid ’s bank account over the past two years			2
in addition , the woman has been paying hundreds of dollars each month in phone charges to five companies even though she told police she had only one phone			2
she allegedly told officials that she knew only that the deposits were made by a man she described as her fiancé and his friends			0
prosecutors also say they discovered inconsistencies in her account of her past life			2
she is said to have lied about details on her application for asylum in the @entity118 , including saying she had been gang - raped by soldiers in @entity27			1
investigators said they also found a discrepancy between her account of how she had been subjected to genital mutilation and the version she had provided in her asylum application			0
in a letter to the court @entity126 laid out in detail the problems with the alleged victim			2
in her application for asylum to the @entity118 for herself and her daughter in 2004 she said that the home she shared with her husband in @entity27 was burned by soldiers for the country ’s regime			1
her husband was then supposedly tortured in jail where he died of his @entity141 to prosecutors she later admitted this was a lie			2
prosecutors also said that she cried when she recounted to them the story from her asylum application of how she had been gang - raped in @entity27 , but later admitted that this was also a lie			2
she also allegedly owned up to falsely claiming a friend ’s child as her own to get a higher tax refund , and misrepresenting her income to stay in her present home			0
her lawyer , @entity153 , admitted outside court that her asylum application was ‘ not completely accurate ’ but accused @entity2 ’s district attorney of deserting his client because he was scared of losing such a high profile case			0
he also said suggestions his client was involved in drug dealing were a ‘ lie ’ and claimed the maid ’s daughter had told him that prosecutors had ‘ mistreated ’ and ‘ screamed at ’ her mother while interviewing her			1
although prosecutors have revealed their doubts about the maid , they stressed they have not necessarily changed their mind about the charges against @entity0			1
leaving : but the agreement by a @entity173 does not give @entity0 his passport back speaking : @entity0 , centre , talks in court next to his attorney @entity177 , on friday			2
