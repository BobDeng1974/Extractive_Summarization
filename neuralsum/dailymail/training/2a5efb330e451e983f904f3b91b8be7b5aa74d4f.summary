by @entity0 it is one of the lesser known but more remarkable facts in the annals of cricketing history that @entity6 once took an interest in the game – then fell out with it decisively			1
this was witnessed at first - hand by @entity13 officers held prisoner in @entity15 during the @entity16 , who met the then corporal and were surprised to find him asking for an explanation of the rules			1
a few days later , @entity6 returned to announce that he had been training a team of @entity22 and wanted to play the @entity23 at the earliest opportunity			1
welcome : a @entity27 newspaper reports the arrival of the team for the three - day test match in august 1937 alas , @entity6 found the sport insufficiently violent for the prime of @entity22 volk			1
in particular , it was ‘ unmanly ’ for batsmen to wear pads to protect their legs			2
and so it came to be that , for disciples of @entity41 , cricket was not just @entity23 , but effeminate			1
it is not as if the @entity43 were fans of modern sport in any form			2
once in power , they legalised sabre - duelling , where the object was to inflict a scar on your opponent ’s face			1
with war clouds gathering , the decision by @entity55 , @entity56 , a close friend of @entity6 , to invite a touring @entity23 cricket team to @entity27 is something of a mystery			1
yet in august 1937 , after travelling by ship , the prince @entity64 , from @entity65 to @entity66 , and then by train to @entity27 , @entity61 of @entity62 found themselves in the city for the start of a three - match series			1
the matches took place on a bumpy football pitch with a thin strip of matting to serve as a wicket			2
first , however , there was a local custom to observe			0
shortly before 11.30am , the two teams stood in a line facing one another on the outfield			0
once in place , @entity22 captain @entity83 shouted : ‘ @entity85 , @entity86 … ’ @entity6 , posing in a pre-war photo , harboured a brief fascination with cricket despite @entity15 's penchant for more violent sports ‘ @entity97 ! ’ barked members of the @entity27 team in perfect unison , their arm raised in salute			1
the @entity99 were keen to be courteous			0
their captain , major @entity100 , cleared his throat , and in rather less strident tones than @entity83 , said : ‘ @entity104 , @entity86 … ’ ‘ @entity97 , ’ came the rather uncertain response from his men			1
the @entity99 would later claim that whenever someone offered them the @entity15 salute , they responded by lifting their hats , which indicates a desire to rewrite history somewhat			0
the @entity99 were independent men of leisure or successful businessmen			0
in the 1930s they had been made welcome in the @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , though at a fairground in @entity120 they were banned from the coconut shy after winning all the prizes			0
the club was formed in the 1880s , around the same time as @entity62 and by many of the same people			1
on july 31 , 1937 , @entity128 ’s @entity127 announced that ‘ a team of @entity85 leaves shortly for @entity27 , for ten days ’ cricket in the capital ’			1
the team comprised @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity133 was the son of the @entity147 vice-consul in the port of @entity149 in @entity150 , and a former captain of @entity62 , while the @entity153 - @entity152 were minor aristocracy who kept an early but fearsomely accurate bowling machine in their conservatory			1
the @entity158 playing for the @entity99 was the great - great - uncle of supermodel @entity160			1
for all the @entity15 ’s loathing of the game , cricket and @entity15 shared a secret history			2
the first detailed guide to the game was printed in @entity166 in 1796 , part of a snappily titled collection called games and exercises for the relaxation of @entity172 , their instructors and all @entity174			0
@entity15 played @entity175 in an unofficial test in @entity177 in 1865 , although both teams were filled with @entity23 amateurs			2
by the late 1880s , a small group of @entity182 had started playing and , over time , the sport had gained enough credibility to attract some @entity185 orderliness			0
@entity186 batting for the @entity99 during the match , which took place on a bumpy football pitch with a thin strip of matting to serve as a wicket when the @entity22 authorities decided to classify various sports and activities , cricket received the highest ranking : @entity198			1
the @entity22 were keen to stamp their own identity on the game – a batsman became @entity202 , a bowler became @entity204 , the wicket was known as @entity206 , and the umpire was the @entity208			0
both teams were required to line up 15 minutes before the match for an inspection			2
the sport continued to develop in the early @entity213			0
the @entity214 was created and boasted 14 teams at the height of its popularity			0
in 1911 , @entity219 became the first @entity23 team to visit @entity15 , led by peace activist the reverend @entity222			0
his team won all four matches comfortably			0
the @entity226 thought that it was unmanly for players to wear pads a grand banquet followed and the merriment spilled from the clubhouse on to the field			2
mr @entity222 stood up to thank his hosts , but was interrupted and told that giving a speech in an open space was illegal and he was liable for a 20 mark fine			0
the @entity99 were strictly amateur , yet the tour was a serious matter			0
the request had come from the @entity22 authorities and two of the three matches were seen , by @entity244 at least , as unofficial tests			0
the rising stakes created enough concern for the then chairman of @entity251 ’s @entity250 selectors , sir @entity248 , to warn @entity100 that he ’d rather they did n’t lose and hand the @entity43 a propaganda coup			2
it was no surprise that all three games went to the @entity99 , mainly because the @entity22 batting was lamentable – in one innings they were dismissed for a paltry 19 runs			0
the @entity99 were struck by several odd features of the @entity22 approach			0
particularly disconcerting was the cry of ‘ @entity261 ! ’ from the whole fielding side whenever the ball struck a pad			0
the @entity99 were of a generation that appealed only for certainties , and even then it was the job of the bowler and wicketkeeper to make an enquiry to the umpire			0
another shock was the casual violence meted out on the field of play			2
journey into the unknown : they took the prince @entity64 to @entity66 then went to @entity27 by train for the tour @entity22 captain @entity83 spent the series castigating his players for errors and screaming his frustration whenever a chance went begging			1
during one match , a young team - mate dropped two catches so @entity83 casually walked over to him and sent him crashing to the floor with a right hook			1
the game continued as the poor fielder writhed about on the grass			0
when , the story was reported later to @entity56 , the @entity55 , replied : ‘ yes , i have heard about it			0
but i understand it was a very simple catch			0
’ it is hardly a surprise that some of the @entity99 started to feel a nagging disquiet : @entity303 men patrolling the streets , buildings festooned with @entity15 flags , and anti-semitic signs all made them uneasy			0
even more alarmingly , the sound of machine - guns being fired could be heard			2
mr @entity222 stood up to thank his hosts , but was interrupted and told that giving a speech in an open space was illegal senior gents sensed something was ‘ odd ’ and they concluded on their return to @entity147 that @entity15 was a ‘ strange country ’			1
so why did the @entity22 allow a group of gentlemen from the @entity318 to play cricket in their capital ? it seems likely that the regime was keen to cash in on the propaganda success of the previous year ’s @entity324 in @entity27			1
so when the gentlemen of @entity62 accepted the invitation , they were treated like special envoys			1
certainly they made a good impression in the city			0
their arrival in @entity27 was widely reported , while on their departure , @entity334 wrote : ‘ @entity337 , @entity338			1
’ the paper expressed hope that the visitors were returning home with a more positive impression of @entity15 than the one reported in the @entity147 media			1
the @entity99 arrived during @entity15 celebrations of @entity27 's 700th birthday in august 1937 the @entity347 announced that he wanted @entity22 exchange students in @entity147 to be initiated into the ‘ @entity350 ’			1
but on march 12 , 1938 , the @entity351 marched into @entity6 ’s homeland , @entity353			1
the @entity354 was occupied that october , and in september 1939 , @entity6 invaded @entity355			1
he did n’t even have the decency to wait until the end of the cricket season			2
two days later , @entity147 and @entity175 declared war on @entity15			1
this pretty much marked an end to organised cricket in @entity15			2
the blazing summer of 1937 when @entity363 played friendly games now seems a lifetime ago			2

@entity6 became fascinated by cricket in august 1937 , demanded match
shipped the gentlemen of @entity62 to @entity27 for three - day test
appeared to be propaganda plug after success of @entity324 year before
@entity147 players shocked by violence of captain and *aggressive* shouting
