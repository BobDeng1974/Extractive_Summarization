thousands of @entity1 jobs are at risk as technology giant @entity3 is reported to be preparing to cut a quarter of its workforce in the biggest corporate staff cull in history			1
more than 110,000 jobs could disappear worldwide in a major restructuring at the once - dominant computing goliath – nicknamed ‘ @entity3 ’			1
some 20,000 are employed by the company in the @entity1 across 24 offices , including sites in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
the jobs will be cut as @entity3 undergoes a massive restructuring in a ‘ desperate ’ attempt to revamp its business , according to a report on the @entity34 @entity33 website			1
but @entity3 poured cold water on the article , calling the reported scale of the job cuts ‘ ridiculous ’ and ‘ baseless ’			1
the website said the company was preparing to merge its three main arms – hardware , software and support – into a single operating business			2
it will break down the ‘ @entity52 walls ’ between the divisions and reorganise staff into teams based on their jobs , such as sales or research			1
this is because of the growing demand from businesses to use companies such as @entity3 as a ‘ one - stop shop ’ for technology needs			1
it is expected to restructure its entire global workforce – some 430,000 people – under a programme known as @entity64			2
@entity3 has struggled to shift from its traditional strength of making computers to offering it services and information storage			1
last week , @entity69 , chief executive since 2012 and who joined the company at 24 in 1981 as a systems engineer , reported quarterly profits below analysts ' forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues the company set aside £ 400million for redundancies last week , which it described as ‘ workforce rebalancing ’ , after three - month sales figures came in £ 444million lower than expected			1
if it axes one in four staff , as reported , it will be the largest corporate layoff in history			0
the previous largest redundancy programme was also from @entity3 , when it cut 60,000 staff in 1993			1
@entity89 , from @entity33 , said : ‘ to fix its business problems and speed up its “ transformation , ” next week about 26 per cent of @entity3 ’s employees will be getting phone calls from their managers			1
‘ @entity64 will hit many of the worldwide services operations			2
the @entity34 will be hit hard , but so will other locations			0
’ an @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 does not comment on rumours , even ridiculous or baseless ones			1
‘ @entity3 has already announced the company has just taken a $ 600million [ £ 400million ] charge for workforce rebalancing			1
this equates to several thousand people , a mere fraction of what ’s been reported			0
’ @entity108 will freeze salaries across the company this year as a way of cutting costs in the face of the falling oil price			2
all of the company ’s 15,000 @entity1 staff will see their basic pay frozen at 2014 levels			2
the firm said it would look at increasing them again in 2016			0
the computer company was founded in 1911 and was a merger of four earlier companies			0
when it started out , it focused on technological advances such as the computing scale ( a weighing scale which gave the prices of the different items it weighed ) and the time clock ( which allowed workers to record the times they started and finished work each day )			0
@entity3 played a key role in @entity137 's @entity136 of 1935 , which included the issuing of social security numbers to 26 million @entity34 workers			2
from the 1950s to the 1980s , it produced the first hard and floppy disks , the supermarket checkout and an early atm			0
in 1981 , it released its own personal computer , the @entity145			0
in 1990 , the company was the second most profitable enterprise in the world and was believed to be set to benefit from the continued growth of the it industry			0
but the following year the company 's earnings dropped as it outsourced its software and hardware and between 1991 and 1993 the company posted a $ 16billion loss			0
hundreds of thousands of employees lost their jobs			2
however , a new ceo @entity159 , turned the fortunes of the company around during the 1990s , coinciding with the rise of the internet			0
it focused on business software and specialist microchip production			0
by 1994 the company was showing a $ 3 billion profit once more			0
@entity169 retired in 2002 , with the company once again one of the top computing firms in the world			0
however , in recent years @entity3 has struggled to make the move from manufacturing computers and microchips to the world of cloud computing			1
last week it reported quarterly profits below analysts ' forecasts and an 11th straight quarter of falling revenues .			0
