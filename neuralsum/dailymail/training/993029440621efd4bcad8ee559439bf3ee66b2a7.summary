by @entity0 and @entity1 he 's the former child star turned documentary maker and now @entity5 has set his sights on explaining why modern men are coming under increasing pressure to look good			1
in the latest episode of his @entity11 series , @entity5 takes on ... , @entity5 , 18 , meets the boys and men going to extreme lengths to look good , whether that means surgery or steroids			1
' one guy i met was @entity21 who had taken so many steroids that he had had a heart attack at 18 , ' reveals the star , incredulous			1
working out : @entity5 is tackling male body image in the latest episode of his @entity11 documentary series ' he did n’t want to show us his body because he felt ashamed of it but i looked at it on @entity33 later and he was ripped			1
' he had an amazing body and it seemed mental that he thought there was something wrong with that			2
' and it 's not just insecurities about muscle mass that plagues @entity43 men			2
according to eating disorders charity beat , males make up anywhere between 10 per cent and a quarter of anorexia and bulimia sufferers			1
so why are men going to extreme lengths to look good ? according to @entity5 , natural competitiveness should bear some of the blame			1
' it ’s this idea of being competitive , ' explains the 18 - year - old star			1
' we see all these pictures of underwear models and pictures on the @entity33 because , essentially , we communicate through pictures these days			0
unhealthy : many men , desperate to get a bodybuilder look , are overusing steroids in a bid to gain muscle mass pressure : men 's bodies are coming under the same sort of scrutiny as women 's do ' we are all in a race and we ’re gon na go mad			2
we get more and more competitive and then eventually we are in competition with ourselves			0
' making it worse , he reveals , is the celebrity selfie culture which projects an ideal that the majority of teenagers and twenty - somethings will never achieve			0
' people use this selfie culture as a way of advertising themselves , ' he adds , ' and people constantly feel have to live up to the perfection that they see on @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity33 more and more			0
' what 's more , this is one teen trend that is n't just about impressing the girls			0
' there is that idea of looking good for the opposite sex but a lot of the time men want to impress other men , ' explains @entity5			1
' when i was hanging around with the boys in @entity103 [ for the documentary ] , they said they did n’t care what the women thought - they only cared about what the men said and not because they were gay but because of their competitive nature			1
' and @entity5 himself is n't immune to the lure of a ripped pair of abs. ' i think my main insecurities are with my body , ' he confesses			1
' my body is alright , i watch what i eat and try not to eat loads but i enjoy the odd bit of chocolate			0
but i do n’t do masses [ of exercise ] although i do walk my dog			0
' less charitable types might be inclined to write off the sufferings of men as nothing much - particularly in light of the pressure that women have suffered for years			0
insecure : @entity5 ( right ) with some of the stars of the show , from left , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 @entity5 , however , says this is missing the point			2
' i think that the issue with women was right to be addressed because of all the issues that followed size zero models and so on contributing anorexia and bulimia			0
' but men ’s insecurities need to be addressed too because there are a lot of issues with guys taking loads of steroids and visiting the gym constantly			0
he adds : ' i think if there was a boy or a girl who did n’t have any insecurities that would be ridiculous - everybody feels insecure sometimes and i do n’t think anyone will ever be completely happy with how they look			0
