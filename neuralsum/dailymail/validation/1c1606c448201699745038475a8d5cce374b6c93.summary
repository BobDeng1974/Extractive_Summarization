@entity0 scored a brilliant century to lay a solid platform but @entity2 lost a string of wickets in the second half of their innings to finish with 328 for seven in the @entity8 semi-final against @entity10 on thursday			1
on a good @entity13 pitch in perfect weather conditions , the reigning champions will fancy their chances of overhauling the target of 329 and taking their place in sunday 's final against @entity18 in @entity19			1
@entity0 ( 105 ) came back to torment @entity10 in a partnership of 182 with opener @entity21 ( 81 ) to lead @entity2 to a comfortable position with close to 200 runs on the board , nine wickets in hand and over 15 overs to bat			1
with @entity31 ( 4 - 72 ) to the fore , however , @entity10 struck back to remove the power - hitters in @entity2 's middle order and disrupt their attempt to plunder runs in the later overs			1
" i think it 's a good total , we 're going to have to bowl and field well though , " said @entity0			0
" at the start , if you 're offered 330 , i reckon you take that nine times out of 10			0
it 's going to be about squeezing and hopefully the bowlers can do a job for us			0
" it 's always nice getting hundreds at the @entity13 and hopefully the boys can back it up in the field now			0
" @entity0 had come to the crease in the fourth over after @entity31 had bounced out opener @entity55 for 12 and rarely looked troubled for the remainder of his 122 - minute knock			1
the bouncers were pulled , he called for a cap when the spinners came on and hit 11 fours and two sixes to give @entity10 a rude reminder of his prolific form in the test series around @entity68 , when he scored a century in all four matches			1
the 25 - year - old secured his fourth straight half century at the @entity8 in 53 balls and was soon surging towards his fourth odi century , which he secured with a six and a four off successive balls			2
@entity21 at the other end was looking less assured as he sought to end his run of poor form but he too reached the half century mark before his partnership with @entity0 was broken in the 35th over			0
@entity31 again did the damage , his bouncer cramping @entity0 as he attempted the hook with the ensuing top edge flying to @entity85 at deep square leg			2
@entity87 came out ahead of his skipper @entity88 and hit a brisk 23 off 14 balls before sweeping a @entity91 delivery to @entity92 at deep backward square leg			0
the crowd , the majority wearing the blue of @entity10 , were roused and @entity97 soon departed as @entity31 's third victim with @entity88 ( 10 ) and @entity99 ( 21 ) following him back to the dressing room as @entity2 tumbled to 284 for six			1
even the experienced partnership of @entity102 and @entity103 ( seven not out ) was unable to steady the ship as @entity2 tried to balance the imperative of scoring quickly with making sure they did not run out of batsmen			0
@entity102 departed for 28 to give @entity107 his second wicket and it was left to paceman @entity109 to bolster @entity2 's tally closer to a par score with his 27 not out off nine balls			0
it was the first time in eight matches at the @entity8 that @entity10 had failed to dismiss their opponents			2

@entity10 need 329 runs to beat @entity2 and make @entity8 final
@entity0 scored a century before hosts lost a string of wickets
@entity31 was the pick of @entity10 's bowlers with figures of 4 - 72
