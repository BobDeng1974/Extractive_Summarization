@entity3 players pose for a happy snap after recording thei first back - to - back wins under @entity7			1

the hosts were back in front just after the hour mark as @entity10 turned provider for fellow summer recruit @entity34 , who slotted the ball past @entity64 from six yards out to make it 2 - 1 with his first @entity3 goal			1
@entity26 did well to keep out a two late @entity67 strikes , one from @entity68 and one fantastic effort from @entity70 as the hosts held on for the three points			1
@entity10 told @entity73 1 : ' i think @entity2 is the guy the who deserves this reward rather than myself he saved us throughout the game and particularly towards the end and the penalty as well so not only him but the rest of the side deserve this			1
' he also reserved praise for fellow newcomer @entity34 and hopes the win is the start of things to come at @entity87 , adding : ' yes , it 's great for him			2
' he 's been looking for that first goal for a while now and he 's it 's very , very important for him now			0
' i think not only him but ourselves are on the right road now and the main thing is we 're fighting for victories and fighting for points			0
' we 've got the three points for the day and hopefully we can now move further up the table			0
' while @entity26 was delighted with the result and praised the @entity3 defence , saying : ' i think we played a very good game			2
@entity10 gives @entity3 the lead , finishing clinically from a @entity14 cross @entity26 makes a strong save to his right from the penalty attempt of @entity9 's @entity24 @entity26 makes a save from @entity9 's @entity70 in the dying minutes at @entity87 @entity51 gets on the end of @entity24 ' cross to score the equaliser with a diving header ' i think in the first half we had the possession and we scored a goal and i think in the last 10 minutes they pressed a lot and they had many chances , but i saved their chances and i 'm happy for that , for the win			1
' i think the back four defenders for the team played very well and of course it was a great match a good three points			0
' @entity129 boss @entity128 was pleased with the three points that saw his side move up three places to fourth in the @entity134 table			0
he was full of praise for @entity26 and @entity10 , and said : ' when you hold the penalty out in the dying seconds you hold three magnificent saves , then you are great because you win the game because of that			1
' when you give assists and also you score goals , what can you ask more of a player ? @entity34 breaks his goal - scoring duck for @entity3 with the winner against @entity9 @entity3 boss @entity7 shakes the hand of @entity34 after the striker is substituted after a sensational match , @entity26 ( centre left ) celebrate after the final whistle with @entity32 ( right ) ' but of course we have to improve in a lot of things and also @entity10 has to improve			1
when you do that every week - and he does that every week - then we have to be very pleased with him			0
' @entity128 hopes his side can continue to play their game into the second half , stressing that his men usually play better over the first 45 minutes			0
he added : ' it 's a little bit strange that every time the first half is very good , we start very good			0
we have created a lot of chances and i think in the first half we could have ( been ) 3 - 0 at half - time and @entity9 did n't create any chance - maybe the one off ( @entity168 ) @entity169 but i do n't think so			2
' and the the second half is so different , also with 11 players so i have changed to maintain the organisation and in spite of that , we were not in our organisation any more and that 's a pity because normally you can create a lot of chances because @entity9 want to score and then the space for our attack is very big but we do n't take profit of it			0
' meanwhile @entity9 boss @entity181 was disappointed with the referee 's decision not to stop the match when midfielder @entity185 was injured , and @entity3 went on to score the winner			2
@entity9 manager @entity181 gestures to his players during the loss to @entity3 on his return from a thigh injury which has sidelined him for the past month , @entity185 left the field after 64 minutes to another problem , two minutes after @entity34 's strike which won the match for the home side			1
@entity181 , whose side travelled to @entity87 after a long trip to southern @entity198 in the @entity199 in midweek where they recorded a 1 - 1 draw at @entity202 , said : ' we 're just disappointed with the second goal really			2
' @entity204 was on the ground , we made it clear to the referee to stop the game and he allowed it to play on and it was very , very disappointing			0
it should have never happened it was a game full of fair play , with both sets of players playing in the right manner and i thought the referee made a major , major error there			0
' @entity181 , whose side did the double against @entity3 last season , rued his @entity223 's missed chances towards the end and added : ' it was a very good game and a few chances appeared to open			0
' i just felt that @entity2 made two world - class saves that probably stopped us getting a positive result			2
but even then , i thought that the time we were going forward we were creating and the second - half performance deserved a lot more than what we got			0

@entity3 beat @entity9 2 - 1 with @entity34 scoring the winner
@entity0 was man of the match , but believes it should have gone to @entity3 team - mate and goalkeeper @entity2 after his stellar saves
the win is the first time @entity3 have won back - to - back under @entity7
@entity10 scored the opener in the first half , firing in from @entity14 's cross
@entity26 saved @entity24 penalty that would have levelled the match
@entity24 delivered the pinpoint cross for @entity51 's headed equaliser
@entity26 made terrific saves of strikes from @entity67 ( twice ) , @entity68 and @entity70 as @entity3 held on for *maximum* points at @entity87
