for the first time this century , the skies over @entity2 will grow dark during the day next friday with a thrilling eclipse of the @entity5 with some parts of the country experiencing 97 per cent darkness , outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards			1
here , @entity10 presents a family guide on how to get the most out of an event that will not happen again for more than a decade			1
get out your glasses : special shades like this are a good bet for watching @entity2 's first great eclipse this century , with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 who turned the lights out ! shortly after 8am next friday , the skies above @entity2 will start to grow dim			1
at first , the change will be slight , but little more than an hour later about nine - tenths of the @entity26 will be blocked out			1
not until nearly 11am will the @entity26 finally be restored to its full glory			1
the event taking place will , of course , be a solar eclipse , when the @entity32 passes between the @entity26 and the @entity33 and casts a deep shadow over the @entity33 ’s surface			1
it will affect the entire country as the eclipse travels from the @entity39 and all the way north to the @entity41			1
unlike in 1999 , none of the @entity2 will be covered by a total eclipse			1
instead , we will witness only a partial eclipse			1
the total eclipse will be taking place over the @entity48 — it will start from a spot 400 miles south of @entity50 , skirt the south of @entity52 , pass over the @entity53 and the @entity55 territory of @entity56 , and finish over the @entity58			1
but even though we will not be plunged into total darkness , the effect should still be spectacular — especially if the skies are cloudless			1
with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not taking place over @entity2 until august 12 , 2026 , and the next total eclipse not happening in our skies until 2090 , friday marks an incredibly rare opportunity to witness a phenomenon that has been a source of wonder and fascination for centuries			1
a solar eclipse in the @entity53 , where hotel rooms have been booked far in advance for this latest event so where can i catch it ? it ’s probably too late to travel to the @entity53 to see the total eclipse , as by all accounts hotel rooms and berths on ferries were fully booked months if not years ago			1
however , if you can travel within @entity2 , it ’s best to head north — the farther north you go , the closer to the path of the total eclipse you get and the more the @entity26 will be obscured			1
on the @entity92 in the @entity93 , for example , nearly 98 per cent of the @entity26 will be covered , while in @entity95 that figure falls to just over 82 per cent			2
that may not sound like a big difference , but it is			0
skies in @entity100 will not grow as spectacularly dark as they will in the far north of @entity101			2
the timeline for the eclipse in @entity104			2
first sight will come at 8.20am and maximum eclipse at 9.32am keep a close eye on the weather forecast			0
clouds are the greatest enemy of eclipses , so it ’s best to make sure you head somewhere where the sky is clear			0
the long - range forecast for friday does look promising — but that can change , of course			0
if you want to enjoy the eclipse with a group , consider heading to your local park			0
astronomical societies are arranging events up and down the country , and you ’ll be able to talk to experts and enjoy a festive atmosphere			0
check local press for details			0
the @entity130 is using big screens in @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			0
what 's the best way to view it ? you should never look directly at the @entity26 with the naked eye , even if it is largely obscured			1
do n’t be tempted , either , to wear just sunglasses or welder ’s glasses , no matter how strong the uv protection			0
however , there are numerous ways to view the eclipse without going blind in the process : eclipse glasses : there are many available online , on sites such as @entity159 and @entity160 , and they typically cost less than £ 10			1
whether they are safe is another matter , and even if you are wearing them , do exercise caution , and perhaps still refrain from looking directly at the sun. it is best to consult a telescope or camera shop , which should have stocked up with suitable glasses			0
camera : it is only possible to use a camera safely if you have a solar filter mounted or have securely attached a solar filter sheet to the front of the lens			0
sheets are available for about £ 20 at online stores such as @entity159 , and should also be available at camera shops			0
left to right : binoculars , a bucket of water and a colander can all be used to get a safe look at the eclipse colander : no , that ’s not a misprint			1
if you hold an ordinary kitchen colander up to the @entity26 and cast the colander ’s shadow onto a light surface , such as a white piece of card held about 20 in away , you will notice that the holes project an image of the @entity26 complete with a corresponding chunk taken out of it by the @entity202			1
this is a fun and safe way to watch the eclipse without having to look directly at the @entity5 bucket of water : this is perhaps the simplest method — fill a bucket with water and look at the @entity26 ’s reflection on the surface			1
to make it appear more dramatic , line the bucket with a black bin liner			0
binoculars or telescope : though you should never use binoculars or a telescope for looking at the @entity26 , you can still use them to watch an eclipse			1
after setting them up on a stand or tripod , point them towards the @entity26 — without looking through — until the light from the @entity26 is cast directly down their length and out through the eyepiece			1
then , place a piece of white card or paper behind the eyepiece , and an image of the @entity26 will appear			1
to bring it into focus , use the ring on your binoculars or telescope , or adjust the distance of the card			0
basic pinhole projector : take two pieces of plain white paper or card and , with a drawing pin or similar , make a neat round hole in the middle of one sheet			0
when the eclipse is taking place , hold the paper with the hole in it towards the @entity26 and project the light onto the second sheet by holding it behind the first			1
you will see that an inverted image of the partially eclipsed @entity26 will appear			2
to make the image bigger , move the second sheet farther away			0
the further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence @entity264 in the @entity93 of @entity101 is the place to be on this list the dawn chorus – twice over if the skies are clear , the effect should be dramatic — akin to a sunset in mid-morning			1
birds will stop singing and may even roost			0
then , when the eclipse is over , they will start a second dawn chorus			0
watch out for the sky wolves ! in times past , many people regarded eclipses with a great deal of fear , seeing them as a manifestation of divine anger or believing that the @entity32 was in conflict with the @entity5 in early cultures , the @entity26 was sometimes seen as being eaten by supernatural entities			2
@entity288 , for example , blamed eclipses on ‘ sky wolves ’ that would chase the @entity26 and occasionally catch up with and eat one of them			2
the @entity293 blamed eclipses on a greedy giant frog , while the @entity297 tribe in @entity298 believed the @entity26 was being consumed by heaven itself			2
many cultures would greet eclipses with rituals that involved a great deal of banging and shouting , to chase off the evil beings trying to steal the @entity5 some tribes still observe eclipse rituals , even today			0
the @entity307 in @entity308 do not watch the eclipse , but instead stay inside and fast for the duration of the event , while singing to each other			2
eclipses were also seen as portents of doom by many			0
when an eclipse took place in @entity320 in ad 840 , @entity317 thought it an omen that he would soon die , as his father ’s death had been preceded by two eclipses			2
as it happened , @entity325 was right			0
he died a month later			0
will it affect our power supplies ? in 1999 , during the total eclipse over @entity2 , almost none of the country ’s electricity was generated by solar power			1
today , the figure is 1.5 per cent , and some concerns have been expressed that the eclipse will disrupt electricity supplies			0
the @entity338 says it generates only about @entity339 of solar power during a sunny day in march			0
on friday , only during the eclipse , this will be reduced by nearly half			0
‘ the loss of this solar generation will be largely offset by the reduction in demand for power from people watching the eclipse , ’ says @entity343 , forecasting manager at the @entity338			0
so fear not , there will be no disruption			0
despite the sun being blocked out , the loss of this solar generation will be largely offset by the reduction in demand for power from people watching the eclipse , according to the @entity338 it 's a magical moment for science modern man has learned much from studying eclipses			2
on august 18 , 1868 , the @entity320 astronomer @entity361 observed that day ’s total eclipse through a spectrometer , which measures light waves			1
around the edge of the eclipsed @entity26 , he was able to study the huge pillars of gas that emanate from it — and in doing so he discovered a new element			2
it was named ‘ helium ’ after the @entity371 word for the @entity26 , @entity372			2
the element would not be identified back on @entity33 until nearly three decades later			2
but the most crucial scientific finding made during an eclipse was the confirmation of @entity377 ’s @entity376 , which predicted that light from stars would bend as it passed the @entity5 in 1919 , @entity2 astrophysicist @entity380 photographed the positions of the stars around the @entity26 during an eclipse and then photographed them at night			1
he found that the light from the stars had shifted , which supported @entity377 ’s			0

the @entity202 will pass between the @entity26 and the @entity33 in this *landmark* event
it will cast a deep shadow over the planet 's surface in a partial eclipse
unlike 1999 it will not be a total eclipse over @entity2 - that will happen over the @entity48 and the spectacular event will finish over the @entity58
go as far north as you can to get closer to the path of the total eclipse
eclipse glasses , a colander or a bucket of water can all be used to view it
the next similar eclipse will not take place over @entity2 until august , 2026
