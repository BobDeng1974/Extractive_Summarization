a hand - built animal shelter has been left ransacked after vandals broke in , causing thousands of pounds worth of damage and releasing vulnerable animals into the wild			1
the break - in is believed to have taken place on monday night at the @entity7 near @entity8 , used to house creatures before they are let back into the wild in spring			1
the huge damage inflicted on the sheds , cabins and aviaries has led @entity16 - who founded the charity in 2006 to support injured birds and small mammals - to warn its future is now in doubt			1
devastation : @entity25 volunteer @entity24 is pictured among the damage to the site the facility houses hedgehogs , pigeons , an eider duck , sparrow hawk and barn owls			1
all have been accounted for except for one sparrow hawk and two barn owls , as well as several pigeons			1
mr @entity16 , 26 , told @entity43 : ‘ the place has been smashed to pieces , things poured onto the ground			1
they ’ve had to go out of their way and trespassed on a substantial size of land to get here			2
‘ we all have property and things that are important to us , but this site is something i 've spent so much time on			1
everything that has been damaged has been built with our own hands			2
' it 's been smashed to pieces for absolutely no reason			1
all of a sudden it 's gone			1
it 's not just the actual value of items that have been stolen - it 's the cost of time and funds needed to repair them			1
’ he added : ‘ i knew something was wrong when i could n’t open the gate on tuesday afternoon			0
after being let in by the landowner we found a scene of absolute chaos			0
it was a stab to the heart			0
‘ it was like the @entity76 had been there or an earthquake had hit - everything you could imagine			1
all the doors were open , things were smashed up in the buildings			2
the facility had housed hedgehogs , pigeons , an eider duck , sparrow hawk and barn owls ‘ cages [ had been ] thrown around , mesh kicked in , medication and food poured everywhere			1
’ the site , which is kept hidden from the public by a 9ft fence and razor wire , is thought to have been entered by offenders scaling the gate			2
they went on to steal a generator and power tools			0
mr @entity16 said : ‘ fortunately we have secured the majority of our patients and these animals have been moved away into secure accommodation			0
‘ we are keeping our fingers crossed for those who left as they really were n’t ready to be released and we looked after them for so long			0
‘ but as you can imagine , everything is very much up in the air when it comes to the long - term prospects of the charity			2
it took us a long time to get here and this was more than a burglary			0
‘ it was not just damaged sheds as they were built by hand for a specific purpose by volunteers to help animals in need			0
these people were not just there to steal			0
’ local residents have already begun coming forward with donations and offers of manpower to help the charity get back on track			0
