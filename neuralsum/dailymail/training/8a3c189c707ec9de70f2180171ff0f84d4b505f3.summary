manager @entity0 believes his side must lay to rest their defensive ' ghosts ' before they can move forwards in 2015			1
the @entity4 begin the defence of their @entity7 crown at home to @entity9 on sunday having started the new year with a disappointing 2 - 0 defeat at @entity11 , which left them in sixth and three points off the @entity15 places			1
having produced such a solid rearguard display when winning at @entity18 on december 28 , @entity16 were again architects of their own downfall at @entity21 's with blunders from goalkeeper @entity23 compounded by poor judgements from centre - backs @entity26 and @entity27 which proved so costly			1
@entity0 says his side must lay to rest their defensive ' ghosts ' before they can move forward wenger looking distressed during his side 's 2 - 0 defeat to @entity30 's ( right ) @entity11 @entity0 is expected to rotate his squad for the @entity7 tie , with @entity34 goalkeeper @entity33 already set to stand in for @entity23 , the 24 - year - old @entity35 stopper again seeing his position as number one come under scrutiny			1
@entity16 host @entity39 on january 11 , and then travel to @entity41 - by which time @entity0 knows his defence must pull themselves together			1
' i can not fault the attitude of the team , but we were again haunted by the ghost of what we have seen since the start of the season , ' @entity0 said on @entity51			2
' this is not the first time it has happened			0
we did not defend well enough in the final third , and we paid a heavy price			0
it is a self - inflicted defeat			0
' @entity16 goalkeeper @entity23 ( right ) struggled during the defeat at @entity21 's @entity23 and @entity27 ( back ) failed to keep out @entity61 's opener for @entity11 mertesacker - who failed to clear a looping shot from @entity61 as it bounced over the line after @entity23 had rushed from his goal - accepts there will be some soul searching as the @entity4 look to rediscover the form which had seen them head to @entity11 on the back of just one defeat out of nine games in all competitions			1
' the last two matches we were in good spirits and those games were close together ( over @entity79 ) and we fought really hard for the two wins , but at @entity11 , it was slightly different , we did n't show up with a good performance , ' said the 6ft 7ins @entity85 centre - half			2
' we have to come back to our main strength and we have to remind ourselves every day that we need to have a big performance			0
' @entity23 was then beaten by @entity11 midfielder @entity88 for the second of the afternoon @entity26 ( right ) battles for possession with @entity11 midfielder @entity92 striker @entity93 ( thigh ) missed the @entity11 game because of a thigh problem , and @entity97 serves the last part of his three - match suspension for sunday 's cup tie			1
@entity85 international @entity101 did not feature because of a tight groin , according to @entity0 , with @entity103 set to step up their interest when the transfer window officially opens again			0
@entity0 said : ' i will make a few changes ( against @entity9 ) , that is for sure			2
' teenage forward @entity108 came off the bench against @entity11 , and the 19 - year - old would relish another taste of first - team action this weekend			2
' i am hungry for it now			0
i want to show the boss what i am made of and i think that i am ready , ' he said			0
' i think i can have a good impact on the team , hopefully i get a chance			0
