by @entity0 nearly a million jars of peanut butter are being dumped at a @entity4 landfill to expedite the sale of a bankrupt peanut - processing plant that was at the heart of a 2012 salmonella outbreak and nationwide recall			1
bankruptcy trustee @entity10 said he had no other choice after @entity12 refused to take shipment of the @entity15 product and declined requests to let it be donated to food banks or repackaged or sold to brokers who provide food to institutions like prisons			1
' we considered all options , ' @entity10 said			0
' they did n't agree			0
' wasted : some of the millions of jars of ' perfectly safe ' peanut butter are dumped at a @entity4 landfill after @entity12 insisted it was destroyed dumped : almost a million jars of peanut butter are being trucked to a @entity4 landfill after @entity12 refused to either accept them or allow them to be donated to food banks @entity12 officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment			1
but court filings indicate the product was made with $ 2.8 million worth of @entity40 peanuts owned by @entity12 and had been sitting in the warehouse since the company shut down and filed for bankruptcy last fall			1
after extensive testing , @entity12 agreed to a court order authorizing the trustee to sell it the peanut butter			2
but after getting eight loads , @entity12 rejected it as ' not merchantable ' because of leaky peanut oil			1
@entity10 said ' all parties agreed there 's nothing wrong with the peanut butter from a health and safety issue , ' but court records show that on a march 19 conference call @entity12 said ' it would not agree to any disposition ... other than destruction			2
' so instead of selling or donating the peanut butter , with a value estimated at $ 2.6 million , the estate is paying about $ 60,000 to haul the 950,000 jars of nut butter — or about 25 tons — to the @entity67 landfill in @entity68 , where public works director @entity69 says it ' will go in with our regular waste and covered with dirt			1
' refusal : @entity12 refused to take the shipment and declined requests to let it be donated to food banks , repackaged or sold to brokers who provide food products to institutions like prisons - even though tests showed it was safe closed : bankruptcy trustee @entity10 said the peanut butter was produced for @entity12 before the plant shut last autumn the last of 58 truckloads was expected friday , he said			1
@entity86 made peanut butter under a number of different labels for retailers like @entity12 , @entity91 and trader @entity92 , along with products under its own name			2
but the plant was shut down in september 2012 after its products were linked to 41 salmonella cases in 20 states			2
it later reopened for about five months , but shut down last october after the company 's chapter 7 bankruptcy filing			0
@entity86 processed @entity40 peanuts , a sweet variety of peanut that is unique to the region and preferred for natural butters because it is flavorful without additives			0
@entity110 , spokeswoman for @entity4 's largest food bank , declined to comment directly on the situation , but she noted that rescued food accounted for 74 percent of what @entity114 distributed across @entity4 last year			0
' our fleet picks up rescued food from hundreds of locations weekly and brings it back to the food bank , ' she said			0
' before distributing it , volunteers help label , sort or repack it for distribution to partner agencies across the state			0
' access to rescued food allows us to provide a more well - rounded and balanced meal to new @entity129 experiencing hunger			0
