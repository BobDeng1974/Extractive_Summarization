by @entity0 for @entity1 a ‘ disco squid ’ that changes colour and glows in the dark ensures that life below the ocean waves is never dull			1
the @entity8 ’s incredible technicolour display was caught on camera as it hunted for food at night			2
the 12 - inch ( 30cm ) cephalopod was snapped searching for prey in the shadows , before rapidly swimming away with its catch while flashing different colours			1
mr @entity22 , who lives in @entity29 , said : ‘ i found this squid hunting for prey and it started targeting some zoo plankton off my dive lights			1
the squid uses chromatophores in its skin to rapidly change colour ‘ when they are hunting , they get excited and display the most brilliant colours using the special chromatophores in their skin			1
‘ as soon as it had snatched a couple of planktons , it jetted away with excitement			0
’ @entity19 reef squid are known to communicate by changing their colour , shape and texture			1
they can do this by the nervous control of chromatophores , which are pigment - containing and light - reflecting organelles in cells found in a wide range of animals			1
the creatures use their transformative power to stay concealed from predators , become large in the face of danger and flash different colours to find a mate			1
incredibly , they can change colour on one side of their body to give another squid a message on their right , while adopting different colours on the rest f their body			1
mr @entity22 said : ‘ i 'm happy with how the squid came out with colours because sometimes it is difficult to capture them			1
‘ the key is to deliberately underexpose the photo muting the strobe light , and then brighten the picture later to bring out its natural colours			1
’ ‘ disco clams ’ were recently caught on camera ' partying ' on the ocean floor while producing their own strobe light effects			2
and now one scientist , who first came across the entertaining mollusc four years ago , has discovered the secret of how it lights up			0
@entity97 ales , dubbed disco clams because of this unique feature , produce the effect using its lips - which is packed with tiny spheres of reflective silica - like a mirror ball			0
@entity105 encountered the two - inch clam in 2010 while diving with her mother and sister in @entity110 , @entity111			0
she saw @entity97 ales roll the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc 's body - and produce a strobe - light effect using its mirrored lips			2
she found that the flashing was not a form of bioluminescence , which is a chemical reaction inside animals like plankton that produces light similar to that of a glow stick			0
instead , she found , the edge of the clam 's mantle lip is highly reflective on one side			0
when the clam unfurls its lip - typically twice a second - the millimetre - wide mirror is revealed and reflects the ambient light , like a disco ball			2
the inside of the clam 's lip is packed with tiny spheres of silica , only 340 nanometers in diameter , that are ideal reflectors , particularly of the blue light that penetrates deeper into seawater compared to red light			0
the outside of the lip contains no silica nanospheres , so when the lip is furled , no light is reflected , according to the study , published in the @entity155			0
by repeatedly unfurling and furling the lip , the clam produces a continual rippling light show			0
the non-reflective back of the lip strongly absorbs blue light , so it appears dark and makes the contrast between the sides even more striking			0

@entity19 reef squid flashed different colours after it caught prey
@entity175 captured the *behaviour* near a *wreck* in the @entity27
he said it seemed to get ' excited ' and swam off rapidly , changing colours
creatures do this by using light - reflecting chromatophores in their skin
