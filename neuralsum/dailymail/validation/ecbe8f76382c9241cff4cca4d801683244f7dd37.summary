as the @entity12 tackle count moved past the 250 mark , it was clear that @entity3 had finally met their match			1
there have been questions about the entertainment value of northern hemisphere rugby but , if ever an advert was needed , this was it			0
@entity22 punched the air in delight and the championship race lives on			0
@entity5 killed off @entity3 ’s 10 - match winning run and – describing himself as ‘ a simple @entity30 boy ’ in the post-match press conference – @entity33 proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of @entity35			1

‘ in terms of atmosphere and intensity , it had everything as a test match			0
sometimes you suffer a loss and the next three or four days are a struggle to get out of bed ; we were definitely on it emotionally			0
’ that emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full - back @entity54			1
@entity3 ’s @entity76 was dubbed as the player with gold - plated feet , but the celebrated no 10 did not quite live up to his billing			1
the visitors were shot down in ‘ the battle of the skies ’ and were forced to dessert their aerial game that was so effective against @entity123			0
in the early exchanges , @entity72 fumbled a short kick - off and @entity60 won a fine turnover			2
@entity76 kicked a restart straight into touch and @entity5 were able to build up phases			1
all the momentum was with the hosts and , after 13 minutes , they were 12 - 0 up			1
welsh forwards coach @entity132 has told supporters not to expect a feast of flowing rugby but - despite tickets exchanging hands for £ 300 - a - pair on the blackmarket before kick - off – they were more than happy with what they were seeing			0
‘ there are a few “ what ifs ” and “ maybes ” , ’ said @entity3 coach @entity141			2
‘ you look at the small margins that might potentially have changed the result			0
our strategy was the same as the last few weeks but it ’s not a case of back to the drawing board			2
we wo n’t throw the baby out of the bath water because it ’s pretty hard to start all over again			0
’ @entity5 were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to @entity62 in the front - row			1
@entity33 breathed a sigh of relief as @entity76 pushed his first penalty wide of the left post , but the no 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by @entity61			1
the tables were there to be turned and @entity3 identified @entity62 ’s replacement , @entity169 , as a weakness at the set - piece			1
they immediately used their choke tackle to set up a scrum , but @entity66 stole a dangerous attacking line - out from @entity81 ’s 6ft 11 grasp shortly after			0
@entity5 captain @entity66 celebrates with the rest of the squad as they do a lap of honour around the @entity4 it takes two @entity3 players to put a stop to @entity184 's burst forward @entity57 makes a tackle on @entity79 during a spirited defensive performance by the hosts during famous win @entity54 scores the opening points of the match with a @entity5 penalty at the @entity4 in @entity8 it was a carbon - copy of @entity81 ’s pivotal steal against @entity123 two weeks ago , however the hard work was undone when the @entity12 skipper was sent to the sin - bin after half an hour			1
@entity76 continued to edge his side back with two more penalties – sandwiching a fine drop goal by @entity58 – but @entity5 survived the yellow card with their half - time lead still intact			1
@entity33 was forced into more front - row changes at half - time when he lost @entity60 to a hamstring injury			1
@entity3 needed to change their approach after the break and they enjoyed more possession and territory			0
@entity141 ’s players were consistently penalised for not rolling away in the first half and their discipline improved in the second			0
they enjoyed more improved territory and possession , but lack the execution in the final third			0
they camped themselves deep in @entity12 territory in the 50th minute but were repelled by a cacophony of noise and fierce tackles			0
inspired by the roars , @entity66 rallied his players , locked the gates and forced @entity3 backwards			0
in a breath - taking seven minutes , the @entity12 defence saw off two full - blooded attacks – combining almost 50 phases – and eventually won the penalty when @entity76 went off his feet at the breakdown			1
@entity5 outside - half @entity58 bags three more first - half points for the hosts as he scores a drop goal @entity3 's @entity76 carries the ball forward for the visitors as @entity5 skipper @entity66 closes in @entity3 's @entity82 organises his side on his 100th cap in the @entity10 clash at the @entity4 on saturday @entity62 is treated by medics during the first half of the @entity10 clash between @entity5 and @entity3 @entity243 forward @entity62 leaves the field on a stretcher with what looks like a serious leg injury it was a masterclass at snuffing out attacks - @entity63 made a remarkable 37 tackles throughout the game - and proved to be a flashpoint in the @entity12 charge			1
play moved downfield and @entity5 built up phases of their own			2
the forwards carried powerfully - providing the backs with quick , front - foot ball - and two quick passes found replacement centre @entity36			2
the 24 - year - old , who had replaced @entity57 because of a dead arm , short - changed @entity42 after 62 minutes and cut through the defence to slide over for the first try of the game			2
‘ the attitude in defence was second to none , ’ said @entity66			0
‘ @entity22 ’s gone into a lot of detail all week about certain policies to cover their trick plays in attack			0
the boys took on all that information and the detail paid off			0
@entity278 matches you can tell the boys are extremely focussed , and at breakfast i could see that everyone was so desperate to win			0
’ wales were on the brink of their third home victory over @entity3 in 33 years , although @entity3 were not finished			2
on the afternoon of his 100th test , @entity286 turned down a near - certain three points and ordered his fly - half to kick for the corner			2
@entity291 claimed the line - out and @entity5 conceded a penalty try by collapsing the maul			1
