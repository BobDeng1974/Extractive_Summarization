when the sky over @entity3 , @entity4 , lit up one cold march night with a spectacular @entity6 display , @entity1 photographer @entity0 was on hand to record the breathtaking phenomenon in real time with his camera			1
@entity0 , who describes himself as an astrophotographer , traveled to @entity4 's rugged @entity13 south of the @entity14 in march 2013 to capture a celestial event known as an aurora substorm - a brief disturbance in the @entity19 's magnetosphere that causes energy to be released			1
@entity22 substorms are dramatic , fast - moving and short - lived			0
below , a group of spectators camping in lit - up tepees observe the striking display , whooping and cheering at the sight of the brilliant auroras dancing in the atmosphere above them			2
there are two types of auroras - @entity49 , or ‘ @entity6 , ’ and @entity50 , known as ‘ @entity50			2
’ auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the planet ’s surface			1
the interactions between the charged particles give off light			0
auroral displays appear in many colors : red , yellow , green , blue , and violet			0
the color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck , and the altitude of the meeting			0
the common green hue is caused by colliding oxygen molecules at altitudes of up to 150 miles			0
magic in moonlight : auroras occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere the interactions between the charged particles in the atmosphere give off light that can take on a wide variety of hues , from pale green to red and even violent polar opposites : @entity49 , or ‘ @entity6 , ’ occurs near the @entity93 , while @entity50 , known as ‘ @entity50 , ’ takes place near the @entity95			1

@entity1 astrophotographer @entity0 recorded the video in march 2013 in @entity3 , @entity4
@entity49 occurs when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth 's atmosphere
