by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 was today accused of ‘ total hypocrisy ’ after running up a £ 135,000 bill for a taxpayer - funded chauffeur driven limo while sanctioning attacks on cars used by government ministers			1
the @entity11 leader faced calls to use public transport or invest in a bicycle instead of being driven around @entity15 in car paid for by the state			1
it comes after @entity11 blasted transport minister @entity19 for being driven home instead of using the train , accusing him of being ‘ out of touch ’ and telling ministers to ‘ get out of their limos ’			2
labour leader @entity2 has clocked up a £ 135,000 bill for his official car funded by the taxpayer , despite his party accusing ministers of being ' out of touch ; for not using public transport @entity34 @entity33 said mr @entity2 should practice what he preaches and stop being picked up from his ' multi-million pound house in @entity37 in a taxpayer - funded car '			1
instead he should buy a ' bicycle and a hat with a bobble on top ' to get around town			2
official figures released in @entity45 show mr @entity2 ’s official car – provided to the @entity47 – has cost taxpayers £ 135,270.50 since the beginning of september 2010			1
from september 2010 until march 31 2011 , the vehicle cost the @entity51 £ 33,592.71			0
in the year from april 2011 , the car cost £ 56,645.05 and from april 2012 until december 31 2012 , the @entity51 spent £ 45,032.74			0
the revelation is especially embarrassing for mr @entity2 after @entity11 attacked the government for its use of official cars			1
it emerged that transport minister mr @entity19 was using an £ 80,000 - a - year pool car to be driven from his home in @entity61 , where he is mp , to @entity62 every day			1
he claimed he was able to work in the car but after a furious public backlash in the week when rail fares rocketed , he decided to let the train take the strain			0
he was pictured waiting on the platform for the 5.58am , and was forced to stand in the corridor for the 36 minute journey from @entity61 to @entity71 , @entity15			2
but @entity72 , @entity11 ’s shadow transport secretary , used mr @entity19 's car travel to score political points			1
‘ no wonder ministers are so out of touch with the eye - watering cost of rail fares when they are spending tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers ' money being driven around all day , ’ she said			0
‘ they should get out of their limos and speak to those hard - pressed commuters who have this week seen the cost of their season ticket rocket by hundreds of pounds			0
’ today @entity34 @entity33 seized on the remarks to say mr @entity2 should follow his frontbench colleague ’s advice and ‘ get out of his limo ’ too			1
transport minister @entity19 was criticised for being driven home to @entity61 in a government car , so he let the train take the strain last week , and was pictured looking cold on the platform and then forced to stand the figures for mr @entity2 ’s car use were released in a parliamentary question tabled by @entity34 mp @entity101			1
mr @entity101 told @entity1 : @entity2 is n't even in government yet he is still using taxpayer 's money to traipse across the country preaching the politics of @entity107 , when it is hardly @entity107 to be picked up from outside your multi-million pound house in @entity37 in a taxpayer - funded car			1
mr @entity2 has refused to follow @entity113 's example and be pictured cycling to @entity62 ' he needs to have a long hard look at himself			1
at a time when hardworking people are struggling to pay the costs of transport it is unacceptable for @entity2 to be not practicing what he preaches			2
' i am sure @entity72 will want to be consistent in her approach and will be having a long , hard chat with her leader to ensure that there is no hypicrasy going on			0
' @entity128 said mr @entity2 should find alternative ways to get around to prove he is in touch with the public mood : ‘ he would look fantastic in an anorak on the train			1
it would be the geek exactly where he should be			0
‘ he needs to cut his bill down , get a bicycle , an anorak and a hat with a bobble on the top			2
‘ there is complete hypocrisy here			0
every minister is trying to do what they can to go on public transport and reduce costs			2
‘ but where we have got a @entity11 frontbencher attacking a junior minister when her own leader is just flaunting it as well is just ridiculous			0
i think @entity72 should hang her head in shame			0
’ @entity160 , chief executive of the @entity162 ’ @entity159 , said : ' everyone in power owes it to taxpayers to look for ways in which they themselves can save money			0
' any politician with access to a chauffeur - driven car must be looking to reduce the burden they are placing on the taxpayer for using that facility			0
' transport minister @entity177 said : ‘ @entity178 provides an allocated car for the @entity180			1
this is consistent with the practice for the previous @entity180			0
’ a @entity182 said : ' when the @entity183 was in opposition @entity113 was allocated and regularly used a @entity186 car			0
@entity113 ’s own transport minister has admitted @entity2 ’s use of a car is entirely consistent with that practice			1
' @entity2 regularly uses public transport and attends many official functions and meetings in his role of the @entity47			2

labour leader runs up huge bill for @entity47 's car
his party *condemned* transport minister @entity202 's car use and told him to ' get out of his limo '
@entity34 *mps* accuse mr @entity2 or hypocrisy and *suggest* he buys a ' bicycle and a bobble hat ' to get around @entity15 instead
