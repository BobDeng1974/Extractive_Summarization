@entity0 remain hopeful that @entity1 will stay at @entity2 at the start of the season despite the rumblings of intent emanating from @entity7			2
@entity8 and @entity9 will both make bids for @entity1 this summer but so far none have been received			1
@entity0 have enquired about the availability of @entity13 from @entity8 , who the @entity14 are willing to sell , but a part - exchange deal involving @entity1 has yet to be discussed			1
however , @entity0 have yet to receive any such indication			0
although a figure of £ 82million has been mentioned , @entity1 and his camp say there is no release clause in his latest contract and that indicates it will all be down to how much money either club throw at the project			0
@entity9 have long been considered favourites but they have a side issue with @entity42 's contract talks that could yet have a bearing on the speed of their move for @entity1			0
@entity47 in for @entity1 wanted : @entity0 are hoping to sign @entity13 from @entity8 if they lose @entity1 stumbling block : @entity9 's talks with their forward @entity42 could hinder their move for @entity1 video @entity1 family say he should leave @entity0 should @entity42 agree terms on a proposed £ 7m a year deal it is possible they may even postpone a major assault for @entity1 until next year			1
they are selling @entity58 , and are willing to listen to offers for @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
all have been linked with @entity0 but @entity60 and @entity61 , particularly , may have more relevance to @entity64 if @entity9 continue to push for @entity66 favourite @entity65			1
@entity69 striker @entity68 is also being offered to @entity9 which , it is understood , he would prefer despite interest from other clubs .			2

@entity8 believe forward has already decided to leave @entity21
@entity0 have enquired about availability of @entity8 's @entity13
