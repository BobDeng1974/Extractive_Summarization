printing your own smartphone covers , jewellery and even replacement parts for your broken washing machine at home just became a cheaper reality			0
electronics store @entity7 has become the first major high - street retailer in the @entity10 to sell 3d printers and is selling the @entity12 for just £ 700			1
previously , 3d printers were mainly available online and cost from around £ 1,800 up to £ 10,000			1
electronics store @entity7 has become the first major high - street retailer in the @entity10 to sell 3d printers and is selling the @entity12 , pictured , for £ 700			1
the printer can print smartphone covers , jewellery and even replacement parts for your broken washing machine at home using plastic the @entity26 printer is around the same size as a standard paper printer			0
it is built with an aluminium frame , and comes with @entity32 software for product design and five metres of polylactic acid ( @entity35 ) — the 3mm plastic wire used to create the desired 3d objects			1
3d printing works by melting plastic filament and creating solid objects by building them up in very fine plastic layers			2
3d printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file			1
they work in an extremely simple way , by building up a 3d object from layers of material			0
like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base			0
further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
shoes , jewellery and even dresses have been created , with designs often sold online			0
many believe it could even lead to ' mini factories ' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance			0
the first step is to create the 3d object design by using digital software on a computer			1
this design is then transmitted to the 3d printer which begins to build up the design layers in plastic			1
the length of time it takes to print a 3d object depends on the size and complexity of the design			2
for example a phone case takes around 30 minutes to print , while larger and more complicated items would take longer			0
the ornament , pictured left , and a mini figure of @entity97 , right , were printed using @entity7 's @entity99 printer			2
they were made from polyactic acid ( @entity35 ) which is the 3mm plastic wire used to create 3d objects a 3d - printed model of a human face , pictured , printed on @entity7 's @entity12 printer			1
the printer costs £ 699.99 and that includes the @entity32 software for product design and five metres of @entity35			1
3d printing works by melting plastic filament and creating solid objects by building them up in very fine plastic layers in theory , anything that can be designed using the @entity117 software can be printed using a 3d printer			2
according to @entity7 , the only limit with the @entity12 is the size of the 20cm x 20cm x 20cm printable area			1
@entity123 , commercial director at @entity7 , says : ' we have been excited about 3d printing technology for a long time , as its principles of innovation and creation sit perfectly with what @entity7 has been doing for over 40 years			2
' until now , the cost of 3d printers limited their use to the professional market			1
' however , the @entity12 kit has enabled us to introduce 3d printing to the mass market			2
a @entity7 employee , called a @entity140 , stands next to the @entity99 printer and holds a 3d - printed @entity7 logo			1
in - store @entity143 are technical experts in 3d printing and can help customers interested in buying the printer , according to a @entity7 spokesman customers could soon design their own items , go into a supermarket and have them printed in @entity145			1
@entity152 is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores			0
ideas include digitally making clothing , furniture , personal gifts and even food in their shops			0
the project could also see @entity152 stores repair broken items or print spare parts for a product that has already been purchased			0
' we selected this model primarily because it offers high performance printing at an affordable price , making it accessible to our customers			0
' our in - store @entity143 are technical experts in this field and therefore we are in a great position to assist our customers in understanding this product , which for many will be completely new			2
' this is only a first step for @entity7 into the world of @entity145 and we look forward to developing this category further in the future			0
