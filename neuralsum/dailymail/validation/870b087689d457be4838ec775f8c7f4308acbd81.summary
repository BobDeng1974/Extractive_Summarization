when an @entity1 man spotted a ratty old painting at a yard sale , even one dollar seemed like too much			1
so he haggled the price down and bought it for 50 cents			2
fast - forward 10 years later and he could be auctioning that same painting for $ 10,000			0
@entity7 is n't sure what exactly it was about the painting of seven men playing pool that captured his attention a decade ago - just that it ' jumped out ' at him			1
but last week he discovered it was painted by esteemed artists from @entity23 's @entity22 ' that one just stood out to me , ' he told @entity25			1
' do n't know if it was the oldest , rattiest one or what it was			0
