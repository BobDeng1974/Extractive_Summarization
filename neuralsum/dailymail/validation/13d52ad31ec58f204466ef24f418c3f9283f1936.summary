while some declared they had no regrets , others were much more forthcoming in their vulnerable state			2
alcohol addiction , theft and smoking weed were among the most explosive revelations from those keen to unburden themselves			0

there were positive messages too though , with one elderly couple expressing joy at where they live , while a little girl simply wished she had brought her doll out with her			0
@entity11 said of the project : ' this question has given to me the chance to have a profound connection between me and the interlocutor , thus managing to get into their soul and bring out a grinding they have for years			1
' the girl on the left wrote ' not having the confidence to be the best i can ' and the girl hiding behind her sign wrote ' what i did last night ' this man regrets : ' not saying " i love you ! " enough ' but while many people @entity11 asked were happy to open up about their experiences , others flatly refused			1
