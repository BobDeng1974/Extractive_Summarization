by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 12:47 est , 7 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:00 est , 7 february 2014 the @entity4 does n't like it , and neither does a prominent @entity7 @entity6 , but @entity9 athletes who win medals in @entity11 will have to pay federal income taxes on their cash bonuses			1
the @entity14 awards $ 25,000 for each gold medal , $ 15,000 for silver and $ 10,000 for bronze			1
but top athletes who are in the top income tax bracket , 39.6 per cent , will have to fork over as much as $ 9,900 of a gold medal payout			1
competitors in @entity11 , @entity21 will be able to deduct their expenses that are n't covered by the @entity14 or their others sponsors , but there may be additional taxes levied by states and cities on top of what @entity30 takes			1
and adding insult to injury , any precious metals in their medals will also be taxed			0
the @entity11 gold medals will be worth $ 566 , and contain mostly silver			2
the could drive the total federal tax liability for a gold medal winner north of $ 10,000			1
all hail the @entity9 taxpayers ! any valuable @entity1 win in @entity11 , and the cash bonuses that come with them , will be subject to hefty federal income taxes magic : the @entity43 are underway , and as the @entity1 medal count rises , so will @entity30 's take of the proceeds in 2012 @entity48 senator @entity47 introduced legislation that would exempt @entity9 athletes from paying income taxes on their bonuses			1
the @entity4 said at the time that president @entity53 supported the measure			0
' our tax code is a complicated and burdensome mess that too often punishes success , and the tax imposed on @entity9 medal winners is a classic example of this madness , ' said @entity47 when he introduced the @entity63			1
' athletes representing our nation overseas in the @entity9 should n’t have to worry about an extra tax bill waiting for them back home			2
' a @entity47 spokesman told @entity70 that the @entity6 lawmaker has n't reintroduced the bill since the end of the last @entity74			2
but some @entity75 , led by @entity77 rep. @entity76 , have launched a similar effort , he said , and ' we ’re seeing how the effort proceeds in that chamber			0
' @entity76 filed his bill on wednesday , saying that ' this needless tax illustrates how complicated and burdensome our tax code has become			0
we need a fairer system for all , and eliminating this unnecessary tax burden on our athletes is a good way to start			0
' @entity4 press secretary @entity88 signaled the president 's enthusiasm for @entity47 's measure in august 2012 when a reporter asked about it			0
' the president believes that we should support efforts – like , i think , the bill you ’re referencing – to ensure that we are doing everything we can to honor and support our @entity9 athletes who have volunteered to represent our nation at the @entity9			1
so he supports that bill			0
if it were to get to his desk , he would support it			0
' smile : you 're not @entity1 : @entity108 cyclists won gold in @entity110 , but they 'd be faced with a big tax bill if they were part of @entity113 not that kind of ring , so no new taxes : the presentation of the @entity9 rings was part of the opening ceremony in @entity11 , @entity21 on friday -- but the fifth ring failed to light up @entity122 , an anti-tax crusader group in @entity123 led by conservative firebrand @entity124 , publicized the @entity9 medal taxes on friday with the suggestion that the @entity1 should stop taxing all money earned overseas			1
' because the @entity1 is one of only a handful of developed countries that tax income earned abroad , it is likely @entity1 's competitors will not be subject to such a tax , ' the group said in a statement			2
' ' taken together – the tax on @entity9 athletes and the tax on income earned abroad – it can be said the @entity1 has officially " earned the @entity141 " for having one of the most backwards and illogical tax codes in the world			1
' @entity145 , the group 's spokesman , told @entity70 that ' it 's bad enough that the toilets do n't work in @entity11			0
now our athletes are going to have to flush their hard - earned prize money down the @entity153 commode			2
' the nonpartisan @entity154 agrees the the @entity1 should adopt a so - called ' territorial ' tax system that would allow @entity1 to bring their overseas earnings back home without fear of hefty taxes			2
much of that income has already been taxed in the countries where it was earned			0
' there is no reason to privilege the winnings of @entity1 olympians over the income earned by any other hardworking citizen , ' the group said .			0

the @entity14 awards $ 25,000 for a gold medal , $ 15,000 for silver and $ 10,000 for bronze
the @entity1 is one of the few countries that taxes money earned outside its borders , at rates as high as 39.6 per cent
the @entity9 medal tax also applies to the value of the base metal in each medal – and gold is currently *trading* at $ *1,260* per ounce
athletes who excel in @entity11 will have to treat their prize money as though it were earned in the @entity1 , even though they *'ll* be competing in @entity21
@entity4 @entity6 have a bill that would exempt @entity9 athletes from taxes on their medal bonuses , and the @entity4 has expressed support
