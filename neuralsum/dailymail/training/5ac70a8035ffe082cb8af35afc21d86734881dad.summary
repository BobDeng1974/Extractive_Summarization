they say that nice guys finish last , but for @entity3 it seems that winning is less important than playing the game in the right spirit			2
@entity7 's team may be struggling in the @entity8 , but they refused to take advantage of an indisposed opponent during saturday 's game against @entity12			1
during the first half @entity12 midfielder @entity13 went down after a challenge while @entity3 were in possession , leading the players to halt the game temporarily			0
@entity12 midfielder per @entity13 goes down in midfield as the ball breaks for @entity3 as the @entity22 midfielder lies on the floor , @entity3 could launch an attack against 10 men when the ball arrives at @entity28 the defender points to @entity13 and tells his team - mates to stop it soon became clear that @entity13 was not injured , but had merely lost his boot , yet the visitors refused to carry on until he was ready to play again			1
the @entity3 back four , at the instruction of @entity34 defender @entity28 , simply passed the ball amongst themselves until the @entity36 had sorted himself out and given the thumbs up			0
the 2013 @entity40 finalists ' fair play was applauded by their manager , but did n't do them much good on the pitch - @entity3 suffered their ninth defeat of the season to fall back into the relegation zone			0
still , while results may be going against them , @entity3 seem determined to improve their standing by playing football in the right way			0
the @entity12 man eventually gives his opponents the thumbs up and @entity3 launch an attack @entity56 scored the only goal of the game as @entity3 fell back into the relegation zone			1
