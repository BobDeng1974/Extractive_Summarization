a photographer has captured the moment a man diced with death after he climbed onto a rocky outpost cut off by huge waves			1
the man scaled the 50ft ancient rock stack on the @entity8 near @entity9 in @entity10 and stood at the top for 10 minutes as huge storms battered the coastline yesterday			1
he has been branded ‘ a lunatic ’ for the daredevil stunt on @entity15 , which has prompted coastguards to issue a warning			1
mr @entity23 said : ‘ i live on @entity8 and spend a lot of time on the headland taking photos of the weather			1
‘ i went up there yesterday and set up at a safe place i use a lot to get some pictures of the huge waves that were crashing over the rocks			1
‘ it was a lot rougher than i had expected it to be			0
‘ then , along came a lunatic and his girlfriend who tried to climb to the top of @entity15 , an exposed rock stack right on the tip of the headland			1
‘ it 's a real scramble to get up onto it at the best of times let alone when there are monster waves crashing all around it			0
’ he added that the woman that was with the man was ‘ obviously disgusted ’ with his behaviour and left			0
‘ he stayed on top of the rock for 10 minutes then got back down			1
‘ he was incredibly lucky a big wave did n't break over the rock during that time			1
he is seen attempting to scramble back down the rock as waves crash violently against it			0
coastguards have since issued a warning ‘ the ones that were breaking onto the shore were just colossal			0
‘ if he had ended up in the sea he would without a doubt have been a goner			0
it ’s just ridiculous – it ’s not worth the risk			0
’ he added : ‘ freak waves do break over @entity15 in big seas and it would only take one to come in and it would be game over for anyone on top of the rock			2
’ coastguards said apart from risking their own lives , these stunts also endangered teams going to their rescue as it draws away resources which could be needed to help people in ‘ genuine distress ’			0
@entity85 , from the @entity86 , said : ‘ our advice is to stay away from cliff edges or rocks as they can be crumbly or slippery when wet , which is certainly the case with the recent bad weather			1
photographer @entity23 was documenting the severe weather conditions when he spotted the man he dubbed a ' lunatic ' @entity15 at @entity97 in @entity10 during calmer conditions			1
the artificial stack of rock was left in the 1870s after a natural arch was cut away by quarrymen at the @entity104 on the famous headland and is a popular tourist attraction ‘ do not attempt to climb up or down rocks or cliffs unless you are trained and equipped to do so			2
if you get into difficulty , or spot someone else in trouble , call 999 and ask for the coastguard			0
’ flood alerts were again issued for the @entity10 coast from @entity116 to @entity8 this morning with residents urged to be aware of the risk at high tide			2
householders are still mopping up after @entity121 next to @entity9 ’s inner harbour was flooded on wednesday night			0
@entity123 cancelled sailings between @entity9 and the @entity125 and the storms also left some communities , including @entity128 , without power			2
and the @entity130 is predicting more storms for today with the possibility of hail overnight			0
@entity10 weatherman @entity134 said @entity9 has already had a third of the rain that is expected to fall over the month of october .			2
