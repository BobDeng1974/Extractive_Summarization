it was for years a weekly ritual , marked by teenagers sitting in their bedrooms earnestly pressing the record and pause buttons to capture their favourite tunes while desperately trying to avoid including the presenter 's commentary			0
but now the sunday night tradition of recording the top 40 on a cassette when dozens of children promised their parents they were in fact doing homework , has come to an end after almost 50 years			2
the @entity15 has announced it is moving the top 40 show from its usual sunday afternoon slot , made famous by presenters including @entity19 and @entity20 , to a friday evening to meet the demands of the global digital music industry			1
@entity20 launched @entity23 's first official countdown show with @entity25 in 1967 and since then the show became a cultural staple on sunday evenings , known by many children who taped it on cassette - it will now be moved to fridays as the music industry becomes more focused on digital downloads the change comes after the music industry agreed a global release date for singles and albums , as digital downloads and streaming replace the traditional music store as a measure of popularity			1
as well as the change of slot , the show will be shorter , giving less time for all songs in the charts to be played			2
but station controller @entity49 has has denied the move means the chart was being ' downgraded ' , claiming it had to ' adapt or die			1
' @entity53 singles currently come out on sundays and albums a day later , but the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) - which represents the worldwide record industry - announced last month they were introducing friday as a global release day from summer			1
