@entity25 job : growing numbers of the elderly and disabled are being looked after in ' flying ' visits from carers that last just 15 minutes , a leading charity has warned ( file picture ) the warning comes amid growing concern that cash - strapped councils are putting the elderly and disabled in danger by cutting back on the amount of time carers have to provide help with basic tasks , including dressing , bathing and heating up meals			1
rushed visits are particularly distressing for those with dementia and raise the odds that mistakes will be made when dispensing medication			0
@entity8 ’s survey of @entity50 local authorities found that two - thirds are commissioning visits of just 15 minutes			2
the figure is up 15 per cent on five years ago			0
the responses from 63 councils revealed that in some areas , three - quarters of all home visits are completed in a quarter of an hour or less			2
one 84 - year - old woman who receives a 15 - minute visit in the afternoon , said : ‘ i end up choosing – have i got time to check if they can fill the hot water bottle ? tv personality @entity20 said : ' i believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt ' ‘ shall i choose between getting my meal prepared or them emptying my commode			1
‘ do i get a drink or do i go to the toilet ? ‘ these visits are company			0
i get really lonely and i rely on the visits of my carers but they are never stopping long			0
’ @entity77 , @entity78 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ it is disgraceful to force disabled people to choose whether to go thirsty or go to the toilet by providing care visits as short as 15 minutes long			2
‘ most of us need 40 minutes to get up , get washed and dressed and have breakfast in the morning			0
‘ we should demand better from our councillors and remind them that disabled people are real people with real feelings and should be treated as they themselves would wish to be treated – with kindness , with care and with respect			2
’ dr @entity93 , general secretary of the @entity94 , said : ‘ people with a disability should not have to make choices between on essential care function or another because visits are being scheduled for so little time			0
’ @entity20 said : ‘ i believe it is cruel to treat people like products on a conveyor belt			1
‘ providing this kind of care is a personal service and should be accompanied by a conversation and at least half an hour of the car worker ’s time			0
’ the charity is calling for the @entity111 , which will be debated in the @entity112 on wednesday , to be amended to make care visits at least 30 minutes long			2
but social care leaders said that sometimes 15 - minute visits are ‘ fully justified ’			1
@entity116 , president of the @entity117 , said : ‘ it is totally wrong to believe that all tasks need more than 15 minutes to carry out			0
‘ and frankly naive to believe that simply by abolishing 15 - minute slots a magic wand will have been waved , and improvements automatically achieved in our care services			1
it does n’t work like that			0
