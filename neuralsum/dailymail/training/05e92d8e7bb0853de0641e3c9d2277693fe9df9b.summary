@entity2 has complained to @entity4 after the worker told her that she was a man and not the owner of the car at fault			1
the 50 - year - old , who underwent an @entity24 - funded sex change operation and put herself in £ 4,000 of debt paying for breast enlargement surgery , said : ' i was furious , i burst into tears			1
' ' are n't they supposed to have a policy where they do n't discriminate against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transsexual people ? ' i lodged a complaint there and then			0
' @entity4 is refusing to discipline the worker involved as they say she never meant any deliberate offence			1
@entity40 's car was caught on camera back in october as she parked for a few moments in a bus stop in @entity3			0
because she had been doing a friend a favour , @entity40 , who is awaiting a tracheal shave to remove her @entity51 , contested the ticket with the council by filling out a mitigation form			2
but she was ordered to pay the fine anyway so phoned the authority 's parking control department			0
she said : ' a woman answered and i gave her my name and address			0
' then she said she could n’t accept my payment because the car is registered to a female and i ’m clearly a man			2
' it was like a smack in the face and i burst out crying			2
' she apologised when i put her right , but the damage was done and she should never have said those words			0
' i ’ve had letters from @entity4 telling me they wo n’t be taking disciplinary action because the words were n’t intentional , but that ’s not the point			1
' i want a full apology from them			0
' @entity40 , who has three children from her previous life as a man , says the upsetting incident demonstrates just how essential it is that she has the tracheal shave			0
apology : @entity4 has apologised for the incident involving ms @entity2 but says it will take no disciplinary action against the member of staff as no intentional offence was caused however , health bosses last year refused to bankroll the surgery , saying it is considered to be a cosmetic procedure			1
the former engineer had planned to save up the £ 2,000 needed to pay for the op privately , but is struggling to save the cash			0
a spokesman for @entity4 said : ' good customer service and equality matters are both taken very seriously by @entity4			1
' we are disappointed that ms @entity2 feels these standards have not been met and we again reiterate our sincerest apologies , as already expressed to her on this matter , both by individuals concerned and through our formal complaints procedure			1
' our in depth investigations into the incident , through the corporate complaints process , have confirmed that a member of staff made a genuine error with no intention to cause any distress			2
