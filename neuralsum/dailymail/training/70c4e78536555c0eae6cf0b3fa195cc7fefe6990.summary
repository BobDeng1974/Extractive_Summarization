by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 14:29 est , 10 december 2012 her little boy had a temperature , was sensitive to light and so poorly he could n’t even get out of bed			1
with the gp surgery shut for the weekend , @entity6 rang @entity8 , who said it could be meningitis and told her to take seven - year - old @entity11 to hospital as fast as she could			1
mercifully , @entity11 was diagnosed with a viral infection and sent home with antibiotics			1
@entity17 's mother was told by @entity8 to take him to @entity18 with suspected meningitis			1
the family received a stinging letter from the local medical centre a few days later , accusing them of wasting @entity8 time but mrs @entity6 ’s relief turned to outrage a few days later when a letter arrived from the gp addressed to @entity28 – admonishing him for going to @entity18 instead of the surgery			1
the practice said it had received a letter from the hospital about his visit , and continued : ‘ @entity18 is for life - threatening situations such as a heart attack or stroke and for the care of people who show the symptoms of serious illness or who are badly injured			1
’ a furious mrs @entity6 condemned the surgery yesterday , saying its attitude could put lives at risk			2
‘ i was so angry that they would make us feel that we were wrong to seek medical advice over something like that , ’ said the 33 - year - old mother of four			0
‘ the letter said @entity18 is only for people with serious symptoms			1
how much more serious does it need to be for a child of seven ? ‘ this sort of thing needs to be stopped			0
it could put people off taking their children to hospital when they are seriously ill. ’ @entity28 developed a temperature at his home in @entity65 , @entity66 , on november 9			2
the next day he started vomiting			0
by the third day he was too lethargic to walk or stand and was highly sensitive to light			0
@entity11 's parents rushed him to the @entity70 in @entity71 on the instructions of @entity8			1
doctors there established he had a viral infection and sent him home with antibiotics his parents tried giving him fluids and @entity79 but eventually rang @entity8			1
their local gp surgery was closed as it was the weekend			2
‘ he always has the energy to get up and play , but he did n’t get out of bed and all he wanted to do was sleep , ’ mrs @entity6 said			2
‘ we were really worried			0
if a kid is so ill they do n’t want to watch tv or play with their toys , you know something is wrong			0
‘ @entity8 said get him to @entity18 immediately and take another adult in case he takes a turn for the worse on the way so someone is free to call 999 as the other drives			1
that scared us even more			0
’ she and her husband @entity102 , 34 , dashed over to @entity70 in @entity71			0
staff there said he had a viral infection and prescribed antibiotics			1
a gp visited @entity28 the next day , and he soon recovered			0
but on november 17 he received the admonishing letter from his surgery , the @entity110			0
@entity111 , which is responsible for 55 gp practices , yesterday said the surgery had not realised @entity8 had given advice			2
a spokesman added : ‘ it ’s current practice for some gp surgeries to write to their patients advising them of the importance of using their @entity18 departments for emergencies only and to promote the use of their gp service or the local out - of - hours gp service for non-emergencies			2
‘ we very much regret if the letter caused distress but it was intended to help the family make the right choice about the service they need to ensure they receive the best possible health care in the future			0
