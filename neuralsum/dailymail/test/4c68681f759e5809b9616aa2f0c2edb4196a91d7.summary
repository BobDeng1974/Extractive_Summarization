it looks like a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft , but these strange vehicles are actually new new type of aircraft developed in @entity7			1
two prototypes of the @entity9 were tested this week over the sea off the coast of @entity12 in @entity13 in @entity7			1
the aircraft is believed to be a joint project between @entity16 and @entity7 to build new types of super-efficient seaplane			2
the @entity9 seaplane ( above ) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing - in - ground effect to glide the vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing - in - ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft 's wings are close to the ground			1
length : 13m @entity33 : 15.6 m weight : 3800 kg seats : 12 people maximum load : 1200 kg maximum range : 1500 km flight speed : 175 - 250 km / h flight height : 3 - 5 m wave height : 1.25 - 3 m by placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft , this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air			1
engineers behind the cny 5 billion ( Â£ 500 million ) project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles ( 100 km ) on 28 litres of fuel			2
with a maximum range of 930 miles ( 1,500 km ) , the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph ( 250 km / h )			1
the aircraft races over the wavetops at a height of between three to five metres ( 9 - 15 feet )			0
the @entity61 - 11 aircraft , which have been developed by the @entity62 with @entity16 engineers , can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew			1
the company claims to have just finished building a larger version of the aircraft capable of carrying 40 people , but it hopes to develop bigger aircraft capable of carrying between 55 and 120 passengers			0
the @entity62 in @entity72 tested two prototypes of the plane the prototypes are designed to carry two pilots ( above ) and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development the plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean it says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence , customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along ' marine highways '			1
@entity91 , a spokesman for the company , told the @entity93 : ' the current technology research and development has matured into mass production			0
' the main plan is to invest in tourism , freight , maritime search and rescue and other aspects			0
' the @entity9 ( above ) has been developed with @entity16 engineers and could be used to patrol coastlines the aircraft ( above ) is designed to fly at low level between 3 m and 5 m above the surface of the ocean engineers say the aircraft ( above ) could even provide public transport of the future along ' marine highways ' he estimates that it will cost around $ 20 million dollars for each vessel			2
powered by two large propellers at the front of the aircraft , the @entity9 can be driven in the sea much like a catamaran			0
once it reaches flight speed the aircraft 's wings will begin to lift it off the ocean and it will glide along on a cushion of air			2
@entity130 , one of the pilots who flew the aircraft during the tests , said : ' it felt like when you ride a motorboat then the feeling is just as comfortable as sitting on a plane			0
there are no boat bumps			0
' the company are developing larger aircraft that they hope will be able to carry up to 120 passengers			0

two prototype aircraft were tested off the coast of @entity12 , in the @entity13 of @entity7
the @entity61 - 11 plane can reach a top speed of 15*5m*ph and boasts a maximum range of 930 miles
the super-efficient craft uses increased lift and reduced drag from its wings to fly 16ft ( *5m* ) above *thewaves*
engineers hope the *groundbreaking* aircraft could be used on ' *motorways* of the sea ' in the future
