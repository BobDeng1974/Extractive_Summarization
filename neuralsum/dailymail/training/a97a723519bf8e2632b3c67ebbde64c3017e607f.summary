but tragically , he died just hours before a registrar was due to arrive			1
ms @entity10 , who described her 20 - stone bricklayer fiance as a ' gentle giant ' , said : ' i 'd sorted it with the registrar who was happy to come out and marry us the next day			1
' i had to go and pick up the licences in the morning , but @entity5 was so ill , struggling with his breath , that i could n't leave him and he died at lunchtime			1
' he had always managed to get himself up and into a chair , but that morning we were just together in bed and he faded away			0
' typically his last words to me were making sure our children got their @entity45 presents okay			0
' we told them what was wrong , but that daddy was always going to get better - and he really believed that too			0
' now they know he 's in heaven - the brightest star in the sky is what we call him			0
and they even have a telescope to look for that brightest star			0
' the couple have two sons @entity59 , aged nine , @entity60 , six , and daughter @entity61 , four , while mr @entity5 also had three grown - up children from a previous marriage and four grandchildren			1

' @entity5 was n't the kind to admit being poorly , but when he did go to the doctors they gave huge doses of chemotherapy at @entity80			2
but they could not stop the cancer spreading to his liver			2
' @entity5 was a strong , fit man who worked hard and loved country walking , but he was also a smoker and it does get you			2
' when news of his illness broke , friends and family rallied round to organise fundraising events to pay for the couple 's planned spring wedding			2
mr @entity5 's friend , @entity94 , said : ' we organised a couple of nights out to raise money and also people had promised to donate a wedding cake , hire cars and even a double decker bus for the big day			1

' ms @entity10 added : ' @entity5 was a great big man , but so kind and gentle - any more laid back and he 'd have been asleep			1
' he would do anything for people , but the main thing in his life was being a family man who loved nothing more than spending time with his kids and grandchildren			0
' in the last few month he had reunions with family members he 'd not seen for ages and that was so important to him			0
' now i 've got to keep going strong for our children			0
' we 'd meant to get married many times over the years			0
we never got round to it and now it 's too late			0
' one more day and we 'd have made it , but now i 'm planning @entity5 's funeral			2
