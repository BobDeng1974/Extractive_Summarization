' while it is important not to respond in a knee - jerk manner , these interim arrangements will be implemented until procedures are reviewed after the @entity7 , ' mr @entity114 said			1
horses will also be led along a different path after the race , a decision which was made in conjunction with @entity36 chairman of @entity129			2
' traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race , but will now enter the @entity118 in the order they return , ' mr @entity114 said			2
' the larger crowds that gather for the @entity139 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track			0

dr @entity195 said an autopsy was conducted for @entity92 on tuesday night at the @entity197 and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm			2
a full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more , he said			0
' it 's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart , the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way , and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited , ' dr @entity195 said			0
@entity92 , the pre-race favourite , finished last in the @entity7 and almost walked across the line the heartbreaking moment that @entity7 pre-race favourite @entity92 collapses and dies in the stall after the race racing @entity215 head of veterinary services and equine welfare dr @entity195 ( left ) and chairman of stewards @entity129 arrive at a press conferenceon wednesday			1

the reason for @entity9 â€™s demise was immediately clear			0
speaking shortly afterwards , his trainer @entity230 said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off			0
' they run the @entity7 for 154 years and nothing like that has happened , ' he said			0
@entity154 , racing manager at @entity230 's @entity237 stables , said the horse 's death was a ' freakish accident ' , but he anticipated the @entity99 would review how close punters are allowed to get to @entity7 horses following the race			1
' i think the @entity99 does a magnificent job , but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go , ' mr @entity154 said			2
' someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they 're animals , they get spooked quite easily			2
' mr @entity154 added that it was ' not fair ' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses			0
' all care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and i assure you , you 've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals , ' he said			0
