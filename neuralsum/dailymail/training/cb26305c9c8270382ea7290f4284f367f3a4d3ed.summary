by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:42 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 17 december 2013 cancer death rates in the @entity4 have dropped by more than a fifth since the 1990s , according to new figures from a leading charity			2
in 1990 , the disease killed 220 out of every 100,000 people , but by 2011 this figure had fallen by 22 per cent to 170 people in 100,000 , according to @entity12			1
improvements in disease prevention , surgical techniques , targeted radiotherapy and drug treatments are all said to have played a part in reducing the death toll			1
in 1990 , the disease killed 220 out of every 100,000 people , but by 2011 this figure had fallen by 22 per cent to 170 in 100,000 , according to @entity12 the decrease in the number of people dying from cancer comes despite an increase in the number cases being diagnosed , largely because cancer is more common in an ageing population			1
professor @entity29 , chief clinician at @entity12 , said : ‘ 20 years ago i was training to become a cancer specialist , excited by the findings we were making in the laboratory and desperate to see better ways for us to treat the disease in the clinic			1
‘ we needed to give patients more options and better news about their future			0
i was impatient for more advances sooner and i still am			0
but clearly we 're moving in the right direction			0
‘ i 've personally seen in my clinics , incredible advances in cures for cancers like leukaemia and improvements in treatment options for prostate cancer			0
ground - breaking science in the 1950s led to lung cancer ( illustrated ) death rates plummeting by 41 per cent in the last 20 year ‘ but no clinician , no researcher and no patient will be happy until we 've driven down the death rate even further through research			1
’ the @entity12 report shows that men are faring slightly better than women			1
between 1990 and 2011 cancer mortality for women fell by 20 per cent from 185 to 147 per 100,000 and 26 per cent for men , from 277 to 203 per 100,000			1
the figures were released to mark the launch of the charity 's latest campaign to raise awareness of the importance of scientific research in beating cancer			0
ground - breaking science in the 1950s led to lung cancer death rates plummeting by 41 per cent in the last 20 years , the charity said and today research promises to have a similar impact on bowel cancer			2
a 16 - year trial funded by @entity12 has shown how a one - off screening test for bowel cancer could cut deaths from the disease by 43 per cent and potentially reduce new cases by a third			1
@entity86 , the charity 's chief executive , said : ‘ the words “ you have cancer ” are among the most devastating a patient can hear			0
and for far too long far too many people have had those words ringing in their ears as they leave the consulting room			0
‘ today cancer is not the death sentence people once believed it to be			2
as these new figures show , mortality rates from this much feared disease are dropping significantly as the fruits of research are producing more effective treatments with fewer side effects			2
‘ but while we 're heading in the right direction , too many lives are still being lost to the disease , highlighting how much more work there is to do			0
‘ our aim is that one day everyone will beat cancer and the more research we can fund , the sooner that day will come			0
