sir @entity0 , @entity1 's most senior family judge , condemned his fellow judge 's decision to fund the document translation an absent father in @entity7 was awarded £ 23,000 in legal aid to have @entity1 court documents translated from @entity10 , it emerged yesterday			1
a judge ordered that the man had the right to read 591 pages of reports about the case that will decide the future of his eight - year - old daughter – who lives 1,000 miles away from him in @entity20			1
the cost of translating the papers , said by a district judge to be ‘ essential ’ , amounted to just over 10p a word or £ 38 a page			1
the bill for the father – who speaks no @entity10 – was condemned yesterday by the country ’s most senior family judge			0
sir @entity0 said it was ‘ impossible to justify ’			2
he warned lawyers who protest about cuts to legal aid that it was ‘ no good complaining that public funds are available only for x and not for y if money available for @entity36 is being squandered ’			2
sir @entity0 , president of the @entity40 ’s @entity40 , said it was only necessary for the father to be able to read 51 pages of documents			1
but translating even the slimmed - down bundle of legal and social work papers is still likely to cost taxpayers around £ 2,000			2
the case will decide the future of three children of a @entity52 woman who are in state care			0
the oldest is the daughter of the @entity7 man , but sir @entity0 said ‘ little of the documentation relates to or refers to him ’			1
however , a district judge in @entity59 , who was not named in sir @entity0 ’s ruling , decided in a hearing in november that the father could not make his views known in court ‘ until he has had the opportunity of considering the papers ’			2
the district judge ruled that the father should be able to read more than half of the nearly 1,000 pages			0
but sir @entity0 said the 591 pages to be translated included 23 pages of @entity52 council ’s legal applications ; 16 of court orders ; 17 of immigration reports on another person ; 32 of transcripts of recordings of the children ; 131 of statements by the mother ; and an index			1
‘ i could go on , ’ he said , adding : ‘ why are these pages in the bundle at all ? ’ he criticised lawyers who let files of court documents grow to the length of a novel , and said they should be no longer than 350 pages			0
the high court judge warned lawyers who put bigger files before the court that they may have their fees docked , their papers destroyed , or be ordered to start the work again			0
‘ public funds , whether those under the control of the @entity101 or those under the control of other public bodies are limited , ’ he said			0
‘ it is essential that such public funds as are available are carefully husbanded and properly applied			0
’ last month , sir @entity0 attacked the failure of the legal aid system to provide a lawyer for two parents with learning difficulties from @entity113 trying to stop their three - year - old son being adopted			1
he said the refusal to grant aid , on grounds of the father ’s £ 800 - a - month earnings , was ‘ neither compassionate nor even humane ’ .			0

£ 23,000 in legal aid for translated notes *agreed* for absent @entity7 father
*junior* judge ordered he had right to read 591 pages of daughter 's *custody* case
the *extortionate* cost of translating the pages amounted to £ 38 a page
but the decision to fund the translation has been *slammed* by senior judge
sir @entity0 said the use of legal aid funds was ' impossible to justify '
