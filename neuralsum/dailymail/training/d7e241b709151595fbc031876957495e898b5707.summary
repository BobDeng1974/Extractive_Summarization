a rich husband is less likely to help you with the housework than one on a lower income			0
this is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man 's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality			2
the research also found that women are still doing the most around the home , no matter how many hours they work or how much they are paid			2

this is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man 's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality ' it seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters , filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit , ' said dr @entity31 from @entity32			1
but there is a different attitude when it comes to higher earners – and women could be partly to blame , the researchers say			2
' we found that while men in these households do also recognise the need to help their partners , they remain reluctant to lift a finger and appear to simply throw money at the issue by hiring a cleaner instead , ' said dr @entity31			1
the researchers interviewed 36 partnered women and 12 partnered men for the project , all of whom had at least one child under the age of 14			0
' inequality still exists and that 's perpetuated , in part , by the so - called ' myth of male incompetence ' , ' added dr @entity31			1
it seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters , filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit , ' said dr @entity31 from @entity32			1
but there is a different attitude when it comes to higher earners – and women could be partly to blame , the researchers say ' this is a belief by some women - and our study shows it 's still rife - that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard			1
' one participant in the survey told the researcher : ' i think they do it on purpose , men , do n't they ? ' using the cleaner , he 'll just clean around things , then all of a sudden you 'll move the sofa and you 're like , " what is that under there ? " ... or he says : " do n't clean upstairs now because no one goes up there bar us , you do n't need to hoover ' is his argument "			0
' dr @entity31 concluded that men from lower - income families seem to be starting to do their bit around the home			1
' but until all men are willing to take on more domestic tasks , so allowing women to take on greater responsibility within the workplace , any hoped - for progress in gender equality is likely to stall , ' she added			0
you may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman			0
but sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes wo n’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle - aged women at least			2
a study has found that men who regularly do housework , such as cooking and cleaning , have less sex than men who do n’t bother			1
researchers from the @entity121 in @entity122 studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle - aged @entity126 couples over 20 years , including their sex lives and how they divide household chores			0
the study found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women ’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females			1
the results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of ' masculine ' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn			0
while egalitarian marriages tended to be happier , men who did ‘ feminine ’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven .			0

this is because they can throw money at the *problem* , *scientists* claim
study also found that women are still doing the most around the home
women are partly to blame for fact that some men do n't help , study says
' there is a belief by some women that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard , ' said dr @entity31
