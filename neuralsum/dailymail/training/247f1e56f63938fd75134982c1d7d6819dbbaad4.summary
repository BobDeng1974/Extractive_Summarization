@entity1 and @entity20 were baffled when they were told to phone a call centre nearly 7,000 miles away to order an extra pint of milk just seven miles from their home in @entity10 , @entity28			1
leaving a note in a milk bottle is now a thing of the past for customers of @entity34 - who are now asked to make changes to their order via a call centre in @entity39 , @entity3 - 6,703 miles away from the depot in @entity41 , @entity42			1
mr @entity1 , 49 , a house husband and researcher , said : ' i could n't believe what i was hearing when i was told i 'd have to ring someone on the other side of the world to get a pint of milk delivered			1
' i always either ordered through my milkmen or by calling the depot , they were both very helpful up until last week			2
' if they have to have call centres at least have them in this country , and give the work to people here			0
' have we really got to the stage where we ca n't order a bottle of milk without going halfway around the world ? ' mr @entity1 phoned his local depot last monday to order some juice as part of his round , when he was re-directed to the @entity3 call - centre			1
he said : ' what 's more , is that i was told officiously that i needed a customer number beginning with a letter			1
i could see where it was going , a nightmare journey just to order some juice			0
' @entity34 insist that the call centre will offer customers a more streamlined service , allowing them to change their orders up to 9pm the night before delivery			0
the @entity83 - based firm also said that customers can still leave a note for the milkmen if they like , but that the process would be a lot slower			2
not impressed : @entity34 insist the call centre will offer customers a more streamlined service			0
they say customers can still leave a note for the milkmen if they like , but that the process would be a lot slower a @entity34 spokeswoman said : ' our doorstop delivery has over one million customers in @entity101 and @entity102 , with 250,000 of these customers being online			2
' in response to the needs of our customers we have introduced longer service hours and one convenient telephone number			0
' traditionally , our depots could not service customer calls in the late afternoon or evening whereas our centralised service allows anyone , anywhere , to call us between 8am and 9pm during the week , and between 8am and 4pm on saturday			0

mr and *mrs* @entity20 left stunned by ' utterly ridiculous ' new procedure
