by @entity0 published : 18:23 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 18:23 est , 25 june 2013 it takes a lot to make the prospect of filling in a 52 - page census form appealing			2
but the suggestion that @entity7 ’s vast stores of data could soon help replace it probably does the trick			1
internet search engines could be used as a source of cheap information on citizens ’ lives , interests and movements , a government paper has suggested			2
what does @entity7 know about you ? the company 's vast stores of data could replace the census in a plan to use the internet as a source of cheap data on citizens ' lives , interests and movements , it has been suggested it could spell the end of the national census , which was first conducted in 1801 and has been carried out every ten years since , apart from during the @entity33			1
it aims to cover every home in the country but the last census – the 52 - page giant in 2011 – missed out three - and - a - half million people			2
it cost nearly half a billion pounds , a price the @entity42 considers too high			0
but the possibility of abolishing it in favour of information taken in part from controversial internet multinationals risks deep rows over privacy and @entity52 ’s apparent closeness to @entity7			1
the company is suffering major damage to its reputation following its slowness to curb child pornography and its failure to pay more than minimal taxes in @entity60			1
links : the plan has raised questions about @entity52 's closeness to @entity7 , which has been slammed for paying just minimal taxes in @entity60 there also remain questions over its close links to mr @entity52 , some of his aides , and some ministers			1
the @entity73 has been working out ways of replacing the census with ‘ administrative data ’ from @entity77 , tax and benefit records , the electoral register , school and university rolls and other public sources			0
but officials also want to use information from the private sector			0
@entity73 documents have canvassed the idea of tapping into companies with databases each covering more than ten million people			0
firms mentioned include @entity93 , the @entity95 energy supplier , @entity96 , and @entity97			0
the idea of using @entity7 and other search engines to replace the census was raised in a document produced by the @entity102 which will be discussed at a behind - closed - doors conference today			1
the meeting is mainly concerned with @entity105 , the @entity107 programme for finding an alternative to the traditional census			0
a session of the conference will be devoted to ‘ alternative data sources ’ which ‘ include sources like internet search or transaction data and information collected and held by commercial organisations ’			2
one example of how this could work is @entity119 , a publicly - available website which shows the most popular searches broken down by subject and location			0
it could be used to find data on migration by , for example , checking the number of searches for jobs in @entity60 made in @entity131			0
both @entity7 and the @entity73 said yesterday that the two sides have held no meetings			1
a spokesman for @entity7 said : ‘ @entity119 is a publicly available service			1
we would never sell third party information			0

*proposal* has raised questions over the prime minister 's links to @entity7
search giant 's image *battered* over failure to pay more than minimal taxes
there could also be deep rows over possibility of *invasion* of privacy
