the revelations undermine the @entity2 's claims last week about how many people are using food banks volunteers for a charity that blames welfare cuts for the soaring use of its food banks have admitted that fraudsters routinely ‘ take advantage ’ of the handouts			1
the @entity2 , the @entity14 ’s biggest provider of food banks – which highlighted a ‘ shocking ’ rise in demand for emergency food packages last week – last night pledged to investigate after volunteers were filmed admitting that people could take free food without checks , and that many visitors were asylum - seekers			1
one worker at a bank run by the trust said that people regularly ‘ bounce around ’ locations to receive more vouchers than they are entitled to			2
a mail on sunday investigation has also found inadequate checks on who claims the vouchers , after a reporter obtained three days ’ worth of food simply by telling staff at a @entity38 – without any proof – that he was unemployed			2
undercover reporters posing as volunteers at food banks in @entity43 and @entity44 also found : according to the @entity2 ’s statistics , more than 913,000 people received three days ’ emergency food from its banks in 2013 - 14 compared with 347,000 in 2012 - 13			1
the charity , which runs more than 400 of @entity14 ’s 1,000 food banks , acknowledged that a third of the food was given to repeat visitors , but insisted the rise was based on genuine need for emergency food			1
individuals experiencing severe financial hardship are able to claim food vouchers but there are no clear criteria on who should be eligible			1
once received , the vouchers can be exchanged for three days ’ worth of food at an allotted centre			2
the @entity2 has a policy that an individual can claim no more than nine handouts in a year , but undercover reporters found this limit varied in different branches			1
one volunteer at @entity2 - run food bank in @entity73 , who had been helping the charity for more than a year , said that he regularly saw the same people claiming more food parcels than they were in entitled to			1
lax system : limits on how many food parcels people are allowed to claim vary across the @entity14 volunteer filmed by @entity84 at @entity2 's @entity73 food bank : ' people take advantage ... they bounce around different locations to get the vouchers ' staff at @entity92 ’s citizens ’ @entity38 handed out a food bank voucher to an undercover @entity95 reporter entitling him to a generous three days ’ worth of shopping – without even asking for any identification			1
our reporter @entity98 , pictured , arrived at the @entity38 office near the city ’s railway station to enquire about food vouchers			2
after filling out a form giving his name , address , date of birth , phone number and the reason for the visit , the reporter was told to wait for an assessor to interview him			0
the woman , called @entity114 , who was in her 60s , asked our reporter a series of questions about why the food bank vouchers were needed			1
he explained he had been unemployed for a few months and had been caught out by higher than expected winter fuel bills and was strapped for cash and food			2
he added that his wife had left her job and was not earning and that they had two children to care for			0
after asking for details of how much jobseekers ’ @entity129 was received , the assessor ’s questions turned to the dietary requirements of the reporter and his family			0
@entity114 asked our man to wait while she found out which food bank would be able to help him and then returned with an official voucher signed by the centre ’s manager @entity138			1
from there the reporter was sent to the @entity2 - run food bank at @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity92 , where he presented the voucher to one of several helpers			1
within minutes he was given with four shopping bags bursting with essentials – about £ 40 worth of groceries			0
these included basics such as bread , sugar and pasta , as well as less essential items such chocolate pudding			0
after inviting the reporter to help himself to the soap , toothpaste and hot dog rolls they had spare , the volunteers wished him a @entity164 and he staggered out of the church with his bags			0
he later returned the goods			0
last night the @entity2 said any distributor found to be providing vouchers to people not in genuine need would receive extra training			2
@entity173 was given our basket included : @entity177 ’s bread £ 1.45 ; apple juice £ 1 ; @entity181 steak & ale pie £ 2.49 ; @entity183 tomato soup 89p ; @entity185 pasta sauce £ 1 ; @entity186 sauce £ 1.80 ; instant mashed potato 28p ; creamed rice pudding 15p ; long - life milk 56p ; @entity191 stew £ 1.49 ; spaghetti rings 34p ; sliced peaches in juice 35p ; custard 17p ; new potatoes in water 15p ; plum tomatoes 34p ; @entity200 sugar £ 1 ; tea bags £ 2 ; processed peas 21p ; kidney beans 25p ; tuna steaks £ 1.39 ; sardines 60p ; spaghetti 16p ; meatballs 45p ; chocolate pudding 65p ; strawberry jam 29p ; bran flakes 88p ; bread sauce 70p ; risotto rice 99p ; granola £ 3.75 ; baked beans 35p ; sticky toffee pudding 65p			0
total : £ 38.35 he said one woman who attended friday ’s session had visited at least nine times in just four months , receiving food each time			1
he added : ‘ it ’s got to the point where i recognised names because you see them so frequently			0
’ the volunteer also said he suspected that several people , possibly other family members , had been collecting vouchers under the woman ’s name			2
the @entity2 , which was set up in 1997 , oversees more than 400 of @entity14 ’s estimated 1,000 food banks			1
it works with local churches to run many of them			0
the charity was set up by former @entity236 serviceman @entity235 and his wife			0
a female volunteer showed a reporter a list of people who had claimed more than three food parcels , but she said that they would be unlikely to be refused items if they visited again			1
in another case , a man was given a food parcel after turning up without a voucher – only a form the @entity250			2
he was handed the food despite a female volunteer earlier saying : ‘ we ’re not supposed to give it out			0
’ @entity255 , lead organiser at @entity256 and @entity144 food bank in @entity258 , @entity44 , said : ‘ sometimes you get professional people on £ 60,000 salaries dropping in			1
‘ they have just been made redundant and feel embarrassed to be here			0
they still have the trappings of a good job , like @entity265 and @entity266 , which are under contract , but they ca n’t afford to eat			0
’ another volunteer revealed : ‘ some people just hoover up everything and even complain that the product is a cheap one and not the brand they want			0
’ senior @entity276 mp @entity275 welcomed this paper ’s investigation , saying he had ‘ always been very suspicious ’ of the level of abuse in some food banks			1
he said : ‘ there are also a lot of dishonest people who will cadge their way into situations			0
‘ food banks are run by very kind people			1
they do not understand that there are some people who will take advantage			0
’ last night @entity276 mp @entity293 , a member of the @entity294 , said : ‘ if somebody is playing the system that ’s clearly an abuse of what that charity is trying to do			2
’ last night the @entity2 said it would investigate allegations of abuse , adding : ‘ there is no evidence to suggest that awareness of the food banks is driving an increase in visitors , rather that food bank use is meeting a real and growing need			1
’ additional reporting : @entity310 and @entity311			0

@entity95 undercover film exposes abuse of charity
*scroungers* flout @entity2 's ' 9 visits ' rule to stock up
repeat visits undermine the @entity2 's claim of 913,000 users
after the investigation , the food was returned to the charity
staff at one centre gave food parcels to a woman who had visited nine times in just four months , despite that particular centre ’s own rules *stipulating* that individuals should claim no more than three parcels a year .
volunteers revealed that increased awareness of food banks is driving a rise in their use .
staff at a *supermarket* , where shoppers are *encouraged* to *buy* extra food and *donate* it to a local food bank , were alleged to be later turning up to claim the food themselves .
