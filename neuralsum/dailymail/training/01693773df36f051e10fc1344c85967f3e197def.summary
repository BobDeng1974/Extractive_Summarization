the grave of pioneering punk rocker @entity54 ( 1948 - 2004 ) in @entity55 features a lifesize depiction of him playing the guitar			0
by contrast , crooner @entity52 ( 1917 - 95 ) is commemorated by nothing more than a small plaque in @entity53 reading : ' everybody loves somebody sometime '			0
unique : punk rocker @entity54 is commemorated by a life - size statue of himself in @entity55 simple : @entity52 has nothing but a small plaque with a meaningful quotation in @entity53 while many of the tombs are situated outdoors in public cemeteries , when mr @entity6 paid his respects to @entity183 ( 1775 - 1817 ) he had to visit @entity184 , where the novelist is buried beneath the nave			1
