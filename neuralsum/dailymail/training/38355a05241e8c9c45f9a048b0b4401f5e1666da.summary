by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 21 february 2013 @entity2 : 21:05 est , 21 february 2013 fine tuning : @entity4 is set to return to singing on screen in film @entity6 after her triumph in the movie @entity9 , @entity4 has got the singing bug			1
the actress , front - runner to win the best supporting @entity13 for her indescribably sublime @entity9 performance , is having a number specially written for her in a new film that she will shoot later in the year called @entity6			1
in the movie , she will play an archaeologist who falls for a rock star — to be played by @entity21 singer - actor @entity20			1
they meet when @entity4 ’s character returns to the @entity24 from a dig in @entity26 , when her brother is injured			1
@entity20 plays the brother ’s favourite musician and , well , i wo n’t give the whole plot away but you can see where it ’s going			1
in real life , @entity35 fronts folk band @entity20 and the @entity36			1
@entity38 and @entity39 are writing songs for @entity20 to perform , but one track will be reserved for @entity4			1
the film ’s been written by @entity43 , who will also direct			1
it will shoot on locations in the @entity24 in the autumn and @entity4 ’s husband @entity46 will be one of the producers			1
the actress had been expected to star in @entity50 ’s @entity49 , which was to have filmed in @entity51 next month , but it has been put back till next year at the earliest , for more budget and pre-production work			1
another project on @entity4 ’s mind is @entity57			1
when i spoke to her wednesday night , at a cocktail party @entity60 magazine hosted for @entity9 , she told me she ’d had exploratory conversations a couple of years ago about doing @entity57 on stage — and possibly on screen			1
if she did a theatre version it could well be with @entity67 , who was in a splendid production in @entity69 recently , while the film could be with @entity71			1
‘ i have n’t heard for a while what ’s happening with @entity57 , ’ she said , ‘ and i do n’t know whether i would do it on stage , or screen , but either would be a treat			1
’ stage ready : although she has got her crowd - clap perfected , @entity4 's new rocker project is for the big screen where she plays an archeologist who falls for a musician i notice that record producer @entity83 told a @entity24 newspaper that he ’d like to offer @entity4 the chance to do @entity57 on @entity87			1
but he might have to get past @entity88 first			1
@entity88 would like to do a @entity57 revival in the @entity90 in a couple of years and , of course , he has just worked with @entity4 on @entity9			1
@entity88 has also been planning a movie of the @entity95 - @entity94 show for a while , and hired @entity97 to write a screenplay			1
but there are complex rights issues involving copyright returning to the family of the creators , and other convoluted licensing matters that are being painstakingly resolved			1
i would need the pages of a book to explain but , essentially , @entity4 wo n’t be dancing all night just yet			1
theatre wizard : @entity108 , director of @entity109 around this time three years ago , i stopped off in @entity110 on the way home from the @entity13 to see a show called @entity109 by @entity114 and @entity115 , directed by that musical theatre wonder woman @entity108			2
it was playing downtown at the @entity119 and i knew a little bit about the nine boys , aged between 12 and 19 , who were put on trial in 1931 for the alleged rape of two white women in @entity125 — even though one woman recanted her statement and it was obvious the other woman ’s testimony was a fabrication			2
i caught a preview and was initially outraged that @entity114 and @entity115 had chosen to present the story almost like a minstrel show with black actors playing white characters			2
but i stuck with it , and all became clear			2
the production knocked me for six			2
i could n’t speak as i sat in my seat , weeping , furious at the injustices those nine young boys had endured			2
it remains one of the most stunning pieces of theatre i have ever seen			2
well , @entity109 is coming to @entity51			2
@entity147 , the @entity148 ’s artistic director , has been after it for years and ms @entity108 — the force behind @entity151 , @entity152 and others — will direct and choreograph			2
performances begin at the @entity148 on october 18			2
‘ it seemed proper that we remembered them again , ’ @entity108 told me on monday in @entity110			2
‘ it was a terrible mark on @entity24 history			2
’ she made the point that the boys ’ names were never widely known and she , along with @entity114 , @entity115 and book writer @entity163 , were ‘ determined to bring them to life , as individuals ’			2
@entity108 had worked with @entity114 and @entity115 , the creators of shows such as @entity169 and @entity170 , before			0
but @entity115 died before the project could be finished , and @entity108 assumed the show would be dropped			0
‘ but @entity114 did n’t want to let it go , ’ @entity147 , of the @entity148 , said			0
he was determined to finish it — and see it on stage			1
@entity108 acknowledged that the minstrel show was a racist art form , popular in the @entity24 in the @entity179			0
but she observed that newsreels of the day said the trial was ‘ like watching a minstrel show ’			0
and the startling format — with only one white actor in the cast — allows the show to make a searing comment on race relations today			0
i ’m sure that some ( like me ) will find it controversial , initially , but it ’s going to be quite something			0
and the only staging is chairs that are used as a train , a cell and , devastatingly , an electric chair			0
casting will be a mixture of @entity24 and @entity21 actors			0
@entity201 and @entity202 were among those at a private @entity205 showcase of @entity207 jewels once owned by @entity208			0
we had to troop upstairs at the @entity207 store on @entity212 to see the stunning diamond and emerald pieces			0
there was a diamond ring on display that @entity208 wore when i sang to her at one of her birthday parties			0
@entity207 bling : @entity202 and @entity201 dazzle at the showcase of @entity208 's @entity207 jewelry @entity224 bought most of the beautiful baubles , and @entity207 purchased them back from the actress ’s estate when she died			1
@entity224 is quoted as saying : ‘ i introduced her to beer , she introduced me to @entity207			0
’ he added : ‘ the only word @entity208 knows in @entity232 is @entity207			0
’ @entity233 should pay a visit while she ’s in @entity205			0
the star is portraying @entity208 in a @entity237 drama called @entity238			0
she wo n’t be impersonating @entity208 — rather she ’ll be attempting to capture the essence of her			0
@entity242 ’s @entity241 bash with @entity243 was such a hit that his @entity13 dinner tomorrow night at @entity246 in @entity205 is over-subscribed , with everyone who ’s anyone ( and some who are n’t ) clamouring for an invitation			0
so far @entity250 and the folk at @entity243 have put the following on the list : @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 ( who may be in @entity13 contention next year thanks to @entity262 ’ film @entity264 ) , @entity265 , @entity266 ( who i believe is a model and perhaps has given up acting ) , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277			1
oh yes , and @entity278 , along with @entity279 and @entity280			0
there are many more going , but i do n’t have space to mention them			0
@entity250 , very wickedly , sent me a couple of last - minute excuses doing the rounds			1
‘ i am only going if @entity288 is going			0
and i want to sit next to him			0
’ followed by ... ‘ promise me @entity288 is n’t going			0
mr @entity288 is n’t on the list			0
he ’s such a good guy .			0
