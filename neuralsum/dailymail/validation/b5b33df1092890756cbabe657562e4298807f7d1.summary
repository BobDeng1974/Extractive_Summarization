' in the moments before the 60metres final at the @entity29 in @entity73 last month , @entity0 glanced around the call room at his competition and his mind flickered back to life on the estate			1

somehow they lost all their money and we ended up with nothing			0
' when i was 14 we were back in the hostel and i had come to my senses			0
i realised how dangerous it was , luckily my dad was strong and could protect us			0
i was living there when i won the @entity202 title			2
' @entity0 represented @entity54 through the junior age groups but struggled to make the leap to the senior team			1

i got arrested and was later cleared , i was 150m away when it happened but the damage had been done , my face was plastered all over the news - papers			2
the week after i was arrested for an alleged kidnap which again was nothing to do with me and i was cleared			0
but i should never have been in that environment			0
' i retired from athletics and was about to join the @entity225 but one day i was walking by the river and i suddenly decided i could n't let my talent go to waste			1

she is the daughter of his half - sister and still lives on the estate			1
they are a close family now but it was not always the case			0

vehemently anti-drugs , @entity0 believes his coach 's protestations that his positive drugs test for nandrolone in 1999 was erroneous			1
' he 'd been retired three years at that point , ' he says , ' i do n't believe he took drugs			2
i 'm a clean athlete and i would n't train with him if i believed he was a drug abuser			0
' but there definitely is a doping crisis at the moment			0
@entity285 ( current 100m world leader ) is running faster at 34 — supposedly off drugs — than he was on drugs			0
' ' i line up against a drugs cheat in virtually every race — @entity285 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293			0
