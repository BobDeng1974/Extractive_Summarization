scientists have made an exciting breakthrough in the treatment of bowel cancer - using existing drugs			1
dr @entity5 , of the @entity6 in @entity7 , said early data showed medication currently used to treat psoriasis , arthritis and myelofibrosis could help in the fight against the country 's second deadliest form of cancer			1
' about 17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die , so we are really crying out for new ways to tackle this disease , ' dr @entity5 told @entity24			2
' we have known for many years that @entity40 signaling is mutated in around 80 per cent of colon tumours			1
' however , this pathway is also very important for the health of the normal cells in the intestine , and therefore targeting the wnt pathway directly poses considerable challenges as you risk effecting the normal cells of the intestine and therefore inducing severe side effects			0
' we had to come up with a new method and target a parallel pathway			0
' this is what brought scientists to the existing medicines , @entity59 inhibitors			1
17,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year and about 4,000 people die the scientists ' breakthrough came when they found that 80 per cent of colon tumours responded to treatment with a @entity59 inhibitor			1
the treatment has caused excitement because the drug only targeted cancer cells , leaving normal cells unharmed , leaving no side effects			0
' in the pre-clinic models we looked at the normal cells of the intestine and we found that all the cells could grow and function normally			0
' none of the mice used in the models lost any weight , suggesting they were healthy and could tolerate the drug very well			0
' the scientists found that @entity83 not only stop cell growth but also prevent the development of new tumours			1
dr @entity5 said this is an exciting breakthrough that has great potential to help thousands of people who have colon cancer or face risk of developing tumours			2
' the main point is that the inhibitors already exist and have been approved , ' he said			0
' this means it is going to speed up the clinical trials process '			0
dr @entity26 , another scientist from the @entity6 said since the medicines are already being used for other cures scientists know it is safe for humans			0
' we hope that this will enable our research to rapidly reach clinical trials for bowel cancer patients and deliver benefits in the near future			2
' the scientists found that @entity113 not only stops cell growth but also prevents the development of new tumours			1

@entity119 scientists have found existing medicines can stop tumour development and growth
' @entity59 inhibitors ' responded to 80 *%* of colon tumours
the medicines are already used to treat psoriasis , arthritis , minor fibrosis
scientists hope this will speed up the process of a new drug for bowel cancer
