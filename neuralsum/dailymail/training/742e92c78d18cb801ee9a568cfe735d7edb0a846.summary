by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:42 est , 20 july 2012 updated : 13:40 est , 9 august 2012 it has been a busy two days for @entity3 as he sat down for his first on - screen interview since his arrest over the death of @entity7			1
he revived his old website and posted a personal plea to supporters , thanking them for their continued prayers and financial help			1
each of those public moves have had a judicial impact as both his hour - long interview with @entity18 ' @entity17 and his bilingual @entity20 video have been added to the collection of possible evidence to be used in his trial			1
one of the most controversial points of the interview was when the 28 - year - old said that ' it was @entity49 ' when asked if he would do anything differently			2
he went on to clarify his statement , saying : ' i do wish there was something , anything i would have done to put me in a position where i did n’t have to take his life			2
’ prosecutors will likely use this to argue that the attack was premeditated and his lack of remorse shows that he may have had ulterior motives during the attack			2
legal analysts feel that @entity3 has put himself in a trap in allowing for the interview to take place			1
‘ he has impeached himself publicly , this is going to be a huge problem for him ... and the prosecutors must be extremely pleased ... he was making inconsistent statements that they can use in a trial against him , ’ said veteran legal consultant @entity71 to @entity37			2
opening up : this is the first time @entity3 has spoken publicly about the night he killed @entity7 no regret : @entity3 , left , tells @entity18 ' @entity17 in an exclusive interview that aired wednesday night that he did not regret being armed or carrying a gun latest twist : @entity3 tried to speak to @entity82 today while she was talking about him on @entity83 but she refused again whether he likes it or not , @entity3 is also being tried in the court of public opinion and that case does not appear to be going very well either			1
legendary anchor @entity82 appeared on her show , @entity83 , on thursday morning telling of her own chaotic interaction with @entity3 the night before			1
@entity3 told the @entity37 team yesterday he would only agree to talk to her after the exclusive with @entity17 and only if she put him and his wife up in a hotel for a month			1
@entity82 , already reportedly seething she did n't get the exclusive , was said to have been ' appalled ' by the conditions and called him ' desperate for money '			1
speaking about the almost - interview on @entity83 , she explained that @entity3 's lawyer @entity97 agreed to let her do the interview but only after he sat down with @entity17 , who ' had been very supportive in the past and @entity3 told me that he was very grateful , and i appreciated his loyalty to @entity17 ' , she said			1
when she arrived in @entity103 yesterday morning for the planned interview , she told viewers when @entity3 came to the door in a t - shirt , it should have been her ' first clue ' that he was n't going to do it			1
defence : @entity3 is represented by attorney @entity97 , centre , seen walking to the @entity110 though she would not disclose what the ' one condition ' was that the 28 - year - old demanded , she alluded to the fact it was payment of some sort by saying ' as a member of @entity37 it was not something she was able to grant '			1
@entity37 does not pay for interviews			2
she then went on to describe @entity3 as ' desperate for money ' and ' very worried about his family ' , adding that he was ' polite , soft - spoken , stubborn ' as his lawyer ' wanted him to do the interview '			1
as she was explaining the situation to her co-hosts and the world live on tv , she heard through her earpiece that @entity3 and his lawyer @entity129 were on the phone asking to speak with her			1
on air , she rejected the call , saying : ' well this is an interesting day			0
but mr @entity3 , if you could not do the interview yesterday , i do n’t think we should do a quick one today			1
in the future if you feel differently , we will consider it			0
' we will now continue with our program and the people who want to be interviewed			0
' @entity3 ’s lawyer @entity129 spoke to the @entity144 , giving a glimpse in the seemingly - chaotic world of dealing with @entity3			1
‘ the client always calls the shots , ’ mr @entity129 said			0
‘ if you ’re on the streets or about to be hungry and worried for the wife you love , maybe you have to make decisions along the way			2
’ speaking about the on - air phone call to @entity82 , mr @entity129 defended his client			1
‘ he just wanted to thank her for being gracious and to apologize			0
we were n’t expecting to do an interview live on her show , ’ he said			2
‘ it was a team decision , made on the fly , quite quickly			0
someone said she was talking about it on the show , so we jumped up and turned on the tv			0
there was n’t a lot of forethought			0
’ first appearance : @entity3 was pictured for the first time after his second degree murder charge on april 12 fellow @entity103 defense attorney @entity174 says that the actions over the past few days give an insight into how the case is being handled behind the scenes , and it is n’t pretty			1
‘ @entity129 is not in control over the situation and has got to pull the reins in , ’ mr @entity174 told @entity179			0
‘ @entity3 is a loose cannon ... he ca n’t see past his nose			2
’ enter @entity3 and his computer : on thursday morning , @entity3 relaunched his website and posted a note to supporters as well as a bilingual @entity20 video saying that he wanted to thank them but also expressing his financial need			1
‘ given the extraordinary circumstances surrounding this case , we have now realized that it is much larger than we ever thought regarding its extent and cost , ’ he wrote on the site			0
‘ we have been in hiding in temporary housing , and our security needs have been extremely high			0
the fund has been devastated by the need to pay $ 100,000 to a bondsman and almost $ 50,000 in security expenses			0
‘ the skyrocketing legal costs have gone unpaid			0
the defense fund is at its lowest point since its inception ; in fact , with outstanding expenses yet unpaid , the fund is near depletion			0
’ evidence : @entity3 told @entity17 that @entity7 broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement , which corroborate with the @entity219 's photos from that night first encounter : @entity3 , right , seen in chains , first apologised to @entity7 's parents at a bond hearing on april 20th the couple have already come under fire after lying about their finances which - when disclosed - led to @entity3 being arrested again and his bail being put up to $ 1million			1
the interview came one day after it was revealed that @entity3 and his wife blew through $ 36,000 of cash he raised from his online legal defense fund on personal expenses like car payments , cell phones and paying off credit card debt -- even though he was in jail at the time			1
among the expenses were $ 600 in jailhouse phone calls			0
@entity3 , 28 , spent three to five hours a day on the phone while he was in jail -- placing an average of 13 calls to friends and family each day , the @entity241 reports			2
in many of those calls @entity3 used code to talk about money , especially from the @entity253 account			1
the biggest single chunk of money was a $ 5,000 payment for @entity3 's first bail , which was set at $ 150,000			1
however , the couple spent $ 7,000 to pay down credit card bills - $ 4,000 on their @entity260 bill alone			0
@entity97 says the bills were for expenses that @entity3 incurred when they had to flee their home after they began receiving death threats			2
grieving parents : @entity266 , left , and @entity267 , second right , the parents of @entity7 , as seen on april 20th killed : @entity7 was shot and killed the night of february 26 in @entity270 , @entity103 by @entity3 since being released , the interview with @entity17 was the first time the 28 - year - old has publicly spoken about the fateful night , explaining that it was no longer a choice for him to reach for the gun once he said @entity7 started bashing his head into the sidewalk and noticed his gun			1
he said : ‘ at that point , i realized that it was n’t my gun , it was n’t his gun , it was the gun			0
he said you ’re going to die tonight , [ expletive ]			0
i felt one of his hands going down my chest to my bolster			0
it just happened so quickly			0
’ @entity17 later asked him if he regretted getting out of his car initially			2
@entity3 said no , then saying he did n’t regret being armed , nor his other actions that night , adding : ‘ i feel that it was all @entity291 ’s plan			2
for me to second guess it , um.			0
. ’ throughout the interview , @entity129 sat beside his client , listening and at one point taking a moment to say that with all the evidence presented , @entity3 ’s second - degree murder charge should be dropped to manslaughter			1
he told @entity17 that if given the chance , he would ‘ tell them that , again , i ’m sorry			2
’ he continued : ‘ i ’m sorry that they buried their child			0
