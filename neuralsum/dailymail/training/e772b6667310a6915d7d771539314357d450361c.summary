a furious row erupted in @entity1 today over claims the government paid @entity5 extremists a £ 9million ransom to free two aid workers held in @entity8			1
@entity9 , 20 , and @entity10 , 21 , flew back to @entity11 this morning after they were captured by militants believed to be from @entity15 affiliated group @entity14 in august			1
news of their return was applauded in @entity19 , but also drew heavy criticism from opposition politicians after @entity23 media reports suggested a ransom of 12 million euros ( £ 9m ) had been paid			1
@entity26 governments including @entity1 have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially			2
if it were paid ' to save two valuable lives , then thousands of others -- equally valuable -- would be put at risk , ' @entity53 said in a statement			2
a ransom payment ' would encourage terrorists , illegitimate entities like the so - called caliphate and simple criminals to take @entity1 hostage , wherever they may be , ' he added			1
foreign minister @entity69 dismissed the claims as ' baseless ' , but did not deny directly that a payment had take place			1
he told the lower house that @entity1 is ' against payment of ransom ' and follows ' the rules and behaviours ' shared by the international community			1
but he added : ' when it comes to @entity1 taken hostage , our priority is focused on saving their lives and the physical integrity of our compatriots			0
' the issue has taken on unusual prominence after @entity90 gunmen killed 17 people in @entity92 and a day after @entity94 police killed two men during a raid on an apparently separate @entity90 group			0
the pair are welcomed by @entity1 's minister of foreign affairs , @entity69 ( left ) at @entity100 in @entity11			1
the foreign ministry said yesterday their release was the result of ' intense work by team @entity1 ' but officials have not revealed whether a ransom was paid or exactly how they came to be freed			1
a report in the @entity108 last year said @entity15 and its affiliates had made at least $ 125 million from kidnap ransoms since 2008 , most from @entity26 governments making payments through proxies			1
the women , from @entity115 in northern @entity1 , disappeared on july 31 near @entity116 in northern @entity8 three days after they arrived from @entity117			1
they were captured by militants believed to be from @entity15 affiliated group @entity14 in august while distributing aid in @entity116			2
wearing faint smiles and with their heads bowed , the women were rushed into the airport hall without a word or even a nod towards the press			0
the pair were to be taken to hospital for a check - up and then to see @entity11 's anti-terrorist prosecution office , which has opened an investigation into their abduction			1
' i 'm feeling such enormous joy : this is the news i have been waiting for for a long time , ' @entity133 , father of @entity10 , said from his restaurant in @entity138 near @entity139 in northern @entity1 , after news of their release			2
' i am so , so happy , ' he told the @entity144 news agency			0
the women were captured by militants believed to be from @entity15 affiliated group @entity14 in august while distributing aid in @entity116 on @entity35 , interior minister @entity148 welcomed the news ' with great joy and a huge sigh of relief			2
' @entity9 and @entity10 were captured by gunmen in @entity116 province while working for the aid group @entity155 , which specialises in health and clean water projects			1
they were last heard of on december 31 when a video was posted online showing them dressed in black robes and headscarves and urging the @entity1 government to do everything it could to bring them home			0
the posting on @entity167 was entitled ' @entity14 detains two @entity1 employees because of their government 's participation in the coalition against it			0
' but the video was not posted on any official accounts belonging to @entity14 , which is @entity15 's @entity8 affiliate			0
@entity1 's foreign ministry has given little away about who it thought was holding the women but had denied reports they were prisoners of the @entity179 group			2
the liberation of the two women leaves two @entity1 unaccounted for in conflict zones overseas			0
jesuit priest @entity183 was kidnapped in @entity8 in july 2013 and aid worker @entity184 disappeared in the tribal zones between @entity186 and @entity187 in january 2012			0
both men are feared dead			0
@entity1 last year secured the release of two construction workers held in @entity191 and the country has a track record of paying ransoms to get its citizens home safely			0
that approach has been controversial with some of its @entity199 allies , chiefly @entity200 and the @entity201 , who argue that handing over cash only encourages further abductions and can end up funding terror attacks			0
in theory , @entity1 signed up to not paying ransoms at a @entity199 summit in september 2014 but media reports suggested money changed hands in the @entity191 cases			1
@entity1 officials were able to portray the @entity191 kidnappings as essentially criminally motivated rather than being the work of hardened terrorists			0
but that stance may be harder to maintain if it emerges that the two women had been in the grasp of either @entity14 or @entity179 .			0

@entity9 , 20 , and @entity10 , 21 , were captured in july last year
@entity23 media reports suggest payment of 12 million euros ( £ 9m ) was paid
opposition leader tweets : ' if a ransom was paid , it would be disgusting ! '
foreign minister did not deny directly that a payment had taken place
the pair arrived in @entity11 this morning after *boarding* a flight from @entity117
