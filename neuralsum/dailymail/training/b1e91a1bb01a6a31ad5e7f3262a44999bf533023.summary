by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has confirmed he will sign a new long - term deal this summer as he prepares to lock horns with the man who advised him to join @entity7			1
though @entity2 has put all discussions about his future on hold to prevent distractions during @entity7 's title charge , he has revealed it is now simply a case of ' when ' rather than ' if ' he puts pen - to - paper			1
it has long been the intentions of @entity7 's owners to reward @entity2 , who has 12 months plus the option for another year on his current contract , but the manager 's first priority is stopping @entity23			1
red leader : @entity2 is ready to sign a new contract to stay at @entity7 selection policy : the @entity7 boss revealed that @entity23 ( r ) advised him to choose the @entity28 @entity2 and the @entity30 manager remain close friends but , as @entity7 home in on their date with destiny , all acquaintances will be shelved			1
nothing is going to disturb @entity2 ' focus in what is their biggest domestic fixture for 25 years			1
' there is nothing really ( planned ) until the end of the season , ' said @entity2 , discussing his future			1
' but there is no doubt that , at some point , we will agree another deal			2
i am sure of that			2
' with each passing week over the last 18 months , @entity7 's decision to recruit @entity2 has looked increasingly shrewd as they have been transformed from perennial underachievers to potential champions			1
and for that @entity56 owe @entity23 a small debt of gratitude : @entity2 was being courted by @entity59 as well as @entity7 but , after an exchange of text messages , @entity23 nodded his protege in the direction of @entity64			1
who 's the boss ? @entity7 are five points clear at the top of the @entity69 with three games to play ' @entity23 told me to take the job and what a great club @entity7 was , ' @entity2 revealed			1
' i had spoken to him on it , he encouraged me about the sheer scale of the club			2
i was talking to him about a choice i maybe had , he knows the size of this			2
' it is a friendship ( we have )			0
it has been a continual relationship since 2004			0
we have just kept in contact			0
i have got on with my life and work and that 's it			0
he 's been supportive of me wherever i have been even , in my time here			0
' we might be considered a rival but i know that if they did n’t win the league he would want us to win it			0
' but is their relationship strong enough to withstand rivalry ? @entity7 and @entity30 antagonise each other and the increase in tensions stem from @entity23 's first spell in @entity101 , when the clubs played each other 15 times in three years			1
helping hand : @entity23 has been supportive of @entity2 ever since the pair worked together at @entity30 ' i understand the history because i was on the opposite side , ' said @entity2			1
' in that period maybe it was made to be the managers ( @entity23 and @entity110 ) and that was the rivalry , but i am a different person and man			2
' i only concentrate on things i can control which is the players and my club			0
i will always fight for the club however that may be			0
i am sure it will be a brilliant atmosphere because of the past but more important how we are doing now			0
' there is little doubt @entity64 will , as @entity2 says , be " in bloom " for this game , a swirling mass of scarves , flags and banners			1
@entity7 have not been this close to to the title since 1990 and the locals are trying to lift them over the line			2
@entity131 : @entity7 fans can feel the title returning to @entity64 for the first time since 1990 cauldron : former @entity30 defender @entity136 knows the atmosphere will be intense at @entity64 it will be another afternoon when the noise is pumped up to mind - scrambling levels and @entity136 , who was on the @entity30 bench in 2005 during the fabled @entity143 semi-final , has explained the influence @entity64 can have			1
' i ’ve seen it from both sides and i remember the atmosphere that night , ' said @entity136			0
' of course i did n’t enjoy it at the time but looking back , that is what you play football for , to be involved in those nights			0
whether i was playing for @entity7 or not , i could appreciate the support			2
it definitely takes a bit out of you when you are the away team			0
when the atmosphere is that intense , it does give you that extra 10 per cent ' i ’m pretty sure the fans will be like they were against @entity162 and now we have to follow up with the same result			0
if we play like we did that day , we can beat anyone			0
