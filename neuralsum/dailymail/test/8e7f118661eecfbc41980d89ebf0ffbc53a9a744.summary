a student who was left with an unsightly cauliflower ear following a botched piercing says she wishes she had listened to her mother who told her not to get it done			1
@entity6 , 18 , had a thick bar put through her ear as an act of teenage rebellion , and initially hoped it would make her stand out from the crowd			1
but when the piercing became inflamed , @entity6 was forced to remove the bar - and the resulting wound healed into a hazelnut - sized lump known as a keloid scar			1
' it 's getting bigger and it 's itchy			0
i had it done to look different , i look different now but not in a good way			0
people shout stuff and stare			0
' it looks like i have a bit of chewing gum stuck on my ear			2
you just want to flick it off but you ca n't			0
' her concerned mother , @entity43 , who had always been against the piercing , added : ' i told her not to have it done			2
i 'm worried about it getting bigger			0
' @entity48 : @entity6 , 18 , says the unsightly lump is ' vile ' and has knocked her confidence badly desperate to get rid of the unsightly lump , @entity6 was forced to seek the help of cosmetic surgeon @entity53			1
mr @entity53 immediately diagnosed a keloid scar , which according to the @entity55 , affects between 10 and 15 per cent of wounds			1
the scars , which usually take the form of a hard lump of tissue and are often larger than the original wound , are most frequently found on the shoulders and neck			1
unfortunately , as mr @entity53 pointed out , removal operations frequently make things worse as the body goes into overdrive to heal the new wound			1
but much to the 18 - year - old 's relief , he also revealed that keloid removal operations on the ear are among the most likely to be successful			2
much better : the teenager is now smiling again after a cosmetic surgeon managed to remove the scar ' the good news is i can take these lumps away and reconstruct , ' he explains			2
' but there is a risk the scars could return			0
' despite the risk , @entity6 chose to go ahead and much to her delight , her ear has been returned to normal			1
' my confidence is over the top , ' she said afterwards			0
' it 's so much better			0
i feel like me again , it 's nice to be back			0
