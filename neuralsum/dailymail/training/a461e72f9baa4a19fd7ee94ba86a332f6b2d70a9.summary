dr @entity17 , a @entity18 research scientist currently working on a vaccine for the deadly virus , said it was ' always possible ' @entity4 could reach @entity2 shores			1
dr @entity17 , who is working with live @entity4 samples at a high containment laboratory in @entity26 near @entity37 , said the huge outbreak in @entity39 was ' terrifying ' and ' seems to be fairly out of control '			1

' dr @entity17 said the huge outbreak of @entity4 in @entity39 was ' terrifying ' and ' seems to be fairly out of control ' the death of an @entity60 citizen from @entity4 last week has sparked alarm across the globe after he was able to board an international flight while carrying the incurable disease – potentially infecting other passengers who could fly across the world			1
@entity4 spreads via bodily fluids so secretions from infected people generally contain the virus , according to dr @entity17			1
border protection officers are on alert to check people who are unwell as they land in @entity2 to detect @entity4 symptoms			1
' ' @entity2 has one of the best border protection systems in the world checking people who are unwell in flight and at the airport , ' @entity2 's chief medical officer , professor @entity77 said			1
' since the @entity4 outbreak the @entity79 has been in contact with all border protection agencies to alert them to look out for the possibility of @entity4 when identifying a person landing in @entity2 who is unwell			1
the @entity87 has urged @entity2 not to travel to the @entity39 nations affected by the virus			0

there 's a real risk that @entity2 travelling in the region could become stranded if the outbreak worsens			0
@entity98 warns that borders in the region could close and travel restrictions be imposed with ' little or no warning '			0
@entity2 who ignore the government 's advice are being urged to check their travel insurance as medical evacuations for any @entity4 patient would be ' extremely difficult to conduct '			2
' the @entity2 government may have limited options in providing consular assistance in these circumstances , ' @entity98 says			0
those in the region should closely monitor local health advice and know the symptoms of the virus			0
symptoms are are severe and include high fever and weakness followed by external and internal bleeding			0
any traveller to the region showing these signs before or after visiting should seek medical attention			0
victims of the virus , or those suffering symptoms , should be avoided at all costs as the disease is highly contagious			0
dr @entity17 will start working with ferrets to research potential @entity4 vaccines because they have displayed human - like infections with other high - risk pathogens health workers in @entity39 wear protective gear on the way to bury a woman who died of the ebola virus from the isolation unit in @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity144 systems have been rigorously tested with both the @entity154 outbreak and the more recent @entity155 of 2009			1
' while the @entity79 says the likelihood of @entity4 coming to @entity2 is low , health authorities from around the country are discussing the possibility and subsequent ways to respond			2
if there was a suspected case picked up by border protection , there are laboratories with the highest level of physical containment in @entity2			2
' ( this ) provides laboratory space , testing facilities , diagnostic methods and highly trained virology and medical science staff capable of handling @entity4 and other viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever , ' prof @entity77 said			0
@entity60 citizen , @entity176 , 40 , died last week from @entity4 after becoming noticeably ill on a flight from @entity96 in @entity39 to @entity179 , @entity180 the @entity181 ( @entity182 ) in @entity26 will start working with ferrets to research potential @entity4 vaccines because they have displayed human - like infections with other high - risk pathogens			1
' all work with ebolaviruses is at the highest level of bio containment deep within @entity182 ’s solid walls and we must work on the virus wearing fully encapsulated suits with an external air supply , ' dr @entity17 said			2
' we are investigating the pathogenicity , or disease causing ability , of these virus strains to understand why the @entity39 strains have a high fatality rate in people , compared to the @entity204 strain , which does not cause human disease			0
' ' we believe that understanding the differences in virulence between these two closely related strains of ebolavirus may hold the key to developing an effective vaccine to prevent this deadly disease , or therapeutics to treat it			0
