@entity1 matzos have rolled out of a century - old bakery on @entity4 's @entity3 for the last time			1
the @entity6 's factory is the oldest in the nation still churning out the unleavened flatbread that 's essential for @entity11 holidays - about 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for april 's @entity1 holiday and distributed worldwide			1
but @entity14 's is planning to shut down its nine - decade - old ovens by the year 's end to move into a 21st - century computerized plant located in a different part of the @entity21 area			1
the contract has yet to be signed			0
about 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for april 's @entity1 holiday and distributed worldwide packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory			1
the factory has annual sales topping $ 20million as @entity14 's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide ' for decades , immigrant @entity11 and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the @entity3 , the @entity11 @entity50 , to reconnect with their history and , of course , delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor , ' said @entity58 , a historian at the @entity59			1
' with the @entity14 's closure , you have a significant chapter of @entity11 @entity3 history closing			1
' tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to @entity11 immigrants for much of the 20th century			1
property values have skyrocketed , with galleries , boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements			0
the @entity6 's property , up for sale , is worth tens of millions of dollars			2
in the neighborhood , the factory will leave behind places like @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 among the remnants of the traditional @entity3 , according to the @entity82			0
the pressure of gentrification , however , is not what has caused the closing of the factor , said @entity88 , a great - grandson of @entity6 , who started the business after emigrating from @entity90			2
' the reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us , ' @entity88 told the @entity82 in january			0
worker @entity95 loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine at @entity14 's matzo factory this early 1960s photo shows the storefront of the matzo factory at the corner of @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity21 's @entity3 another photo from the early 1960s shows a rabbi , center , supervising the @entity1 matzo production at the factory , and pictured right is @entity112 , the great - great grandson of the company founder @entity6 for many workers like @entity28 , the @entity14 's factory has provided a steady job for 25 years , in fact , his only job since coming to @entity119 from @entity120 the bakery first opened during @entity122 , serving struggling @entity11 immigrants			1
by 1925 , the business moved to @entity32 , where the original assembly line winds through four six - story buildings — once overcrowded tenements with narrow , rickety stairs that are still used			0
however , the 48,000 - square - foot factory does not live off nostalgia , as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $ 20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide			1
the other mass @entity119 manufacturer of matzos is @entity137 , with @entity139 imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves			0
demand is growing for matzos even among non-jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives			0
the old factory simply can not keep up with demand , said @entity151 , head of sales and marketing at @entity6 's and one of three cousins running the day - to - day operations			1
' i 'm fifth generation , and if we want this to last another five generations , we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market , ' said @entity112 , the great - great grandson of @entity14			0
' the name @entity14 's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since , ' says @entity168 , whose relatives organized a pre-passover family reunion at the factory			1
the current @entity6 's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed			0
it may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas - fired , tunnel - like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks , inching slowly to the packaging operation			0
workers from the @entity3 factory have already been offered jobs at the new location ( above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory ) operations on @entity32 will continue until the new plant is up and running ( above @entity193 loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine ) beyond the 18 minutes , the dough rises , forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the @entity11 from @entity199 , who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their ' bread of affliction			1
' ' nothing changes at @entity6 's , ' declared rabbi @entity206 , who oversees the factory 's kosher certification			2
some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former @entity213 republics , like machine operator @entity214 , who was born in @entity120			0
he has been at @entity6 's for 25 years — the only job he has ever had in @entity119			0
' i 'm not bored			0
it 's our religion , it 's the history of the @entity11 , ' said the 61 - year - old @entity223 resident			2
operations on @entity32 will proceed until the new plant is running with state - of - the - art equipment that will speed up production			2
these are not your great - grandmother 's matzos , kneaded and shaped by hand			2
@entity233 - produced and machine - packaged , they are a modern effort to preserve tradition			0
the employees are all being offered jobs at the new location , where @entity14 's will preserve its motto — ' the taste of a memory			2
' in the neighborhood , property values have skyrocketed , with galleries , boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements ( above the iconic @entity78 in @entity21 shares the same neighborhood as @entity14 's factory ) as the factory closes its doors , it leaves behind places like @entity79 ( above ) and @entity80 among the remnants of the traditional @entity3			1
