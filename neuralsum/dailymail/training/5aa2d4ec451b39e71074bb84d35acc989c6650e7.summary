by @entity0 with hundreds of proudly displayed taxidermed beasts adorning the walls this may look like the homestead ranch of a @entity6 hunter - but in fact it is the two bedroom @entity9 home of a @entity12 socialite he has dubbed the ' @entity14 '			2
regardless of its very urban location and erudite curator , @entity16 's collection is quite possibly one of the largest in the world and is valued at upwards of $ 1 million			2
indeed , 61 - year - old @entity16 is willing to listen to offers for his impressive troupe which stands at 500 strong now that he is selling his luxury $ 3.4 million apartment which overlooks @entity25			0
however , that has provided his realtor with a slight headache as they try to find a buyer for the apartment willing to take on the fixed taxidermed models			1
impressive : writer @entity16 sits in the living room of his luxury @entity9 apartment surrounded by some of the 500 pieces of taxidermy that he owns in fact the apartment is so dominated by the stuffed animals that the realtor has produced a specially created online listing that shows two sets of photos			1
one shows the apartment as it currently is with the taxidermy , while the other has edited the animals out , ' so prospective buyers can get a sense of the grandeur of the apartment			1
' @entity53 of @entity54 said , ' it ’s a fantastic opportunity to buy a home at the @entity57 , an iconic @entity12 landmark , one of the most prestigious addresses in the city			0
' @entity16 , who describes himself as a @entity9 socialite , celebrity journalist and author has lived at the luxurious @entity57 co-op at 211 @entity25 for 36 - years and began amassing his enormous taxidermy collection in the early 1990s			1
beastly : the hall in @entity16 's apartment is covered in taxidermy including antelopes , bears , eagles and wild cats he is not a hunter and never has been , rather he has scoured museums , stuffed road kill and even found pieces in a country - western disco			2
splitting his collection equally between his @entity9 apartment and @entity81 , @entity82 , house , @entity16 spent roughly $ 50,000 on his hobby over the course of three years			1
hanging from every corner and standing in every available space in his apartment are stuffed turkeys , elk heads mounted on the walls , cougars and standing black and grizzly bears looking fearsome			0
according to the @entity95 , the collection held in @entity16 's @entity9 apartment could fill an entire hall at the @entity97			1
in one of the bedrooms a swan appears to float off away from its ceiling mount and a bison head that @entity16 found in a supermarket freezer in @entity82 is in the other bedroom			0
' he was the wooliest bully i had ever seen , so i called him @entity109 , ' said @entity16 to the @entity95			0
sweet dreams : one of only two bedrooms in the $ 3.4 million apartment reveals @entity16 's desire to cover his home in his beloved taxidermy in between his incredible array of stuffed animals , @entity116 exhibits pictures of himself with @entity121 stars such as @entity122 and artists like @entity124			1
deciding to leave his @entity9 home following the death of his wife in 1999 , @entity16 amassed the collection because he is a lifelong animal lover who grew up wanting to own a zoo			1
he considers his taxidermy collection ' an educational zoological display ' and has decided that the apartment can be bought with or without the collection			1
explaining why he spent so little on a collection that is now valuable , @entity16 recalled that in the 1990s , taxidermy was considered so out of fashion as to be offensive			2
' in the ’ 90s , it was politically incorrect to have taxidermy specimens for various reasons , ' he said to the @entity95			0
' i found i was able to acquire many museum - quality trophies for very little because people did n’t want them			0
' @entity16 's collection includes @entity145 bears , two moose mounts , a black bear , freshwater game fish , bobcats , lynxes , raccoons , turkeys , rattlesnakes and even 40 @entity155 male pheasants in ' full plumage			0
' he would rather that one person or institution took them on and jokingly described them as ' very well behaved			0
' ' i would rather find somebody that would be so amazed that i ’ve done this collection who would want them kept together as a big family , ' he said .			0
