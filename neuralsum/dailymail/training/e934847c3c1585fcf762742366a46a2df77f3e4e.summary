president @entity0 has been judged to be ' chronically incapable ' of conducting a coherent military strategy and ' has no sense of what he wants to do in the world ' , according to @entity9 professor , sir @entity2 - one of the @entity4 's most respected and senior military advisers			1
the damning verdict from a governmental insider of the @entity13 ' closest military ally comes days after the president was heavily criticized by his own former defense secretary @entity15 who said that @entity0 was indecisive and lacked any passion for his nation 's armed forces			1
claiming that @entity13 and @entity4 had committed total strategic failure in their near decade - long @entity21 and @entity22 campaigns , @entity2 said that the recent failed attempts to intervene militarily on behalf of @entity26 rebels ' has left them in a far worse position than they were before			2
@entity47 views : professor sir @entity2 of @entity9 has been sharply critical of the @entity13 , president @entity0 and @entity4 's strategic planning since 9/11 in his new book @entity50 ' if anything it ’s gone backwards instead of forwards , @entity0 seems to be almost chronically incapable of doing this , ' said @entity2			1
' @entity43 may have had totally fanciful political objectives in terms of trying to fight a global @entity57 , which was inherently astrategic , but at least he had a clear sense of what he wanted to do in the world			2
' @entity0 has no sense of what he wants to do in the world , ' he said according to the @entity64			0
even worse still , @entity2 believes that @entity66 indecision over whether or not to launch limited action against president @entity68 strengthened the @entity26 leader and undermined the @entity13 ' power and reputation			2
' what he ’s done in talking about @entity73 in relation to @entity26 has actually devalued the deterrent effect of @entity13 military capability and it seems to me that creates an unstable situation , because if he were act it would surprise everybody , ' he said			0
' i think the other issue is that in starting and stopping with @entity68 , he ’s left those who might be his natural allies in @entity26 with nowhere to go			0
he ’s increased the likelihood that if there is a change of regime in @entity26 that it will be an @entity89 fundamentalist one			0
' the verdicts reached by @entity2 are published in his new book , @entity50 , which is to be released next month			2
critical : former defense secretary @entity15 was fiercely critical of president @entity0 in his new memoir decisive : @entity13 president @entity43 declares an end to major combat in @entity21 during a speech to crew aboard the aircraft carrier @entity101 as the carrier steamed toward @entity103 , @entity104 , in this may 1 , 2003 file photo dithering : @entity13 president @entity0 meets with members of his national security team in the @entity108 of the @entity109 former defense secretary @entity15 has been forced to wear a neck brace while on his book launch after breaking his first vertebrae after a fall			1
mr @entity15 , former @entity113 director for president @entity114 and president @entity0 , fractured his neck after slipping on ice outside his home in @entity118 at the beginning of the year			1
in 2008 , mr @entity15 broke his shoulder after slipping on ice , causing him to miss a congressional hearing			0
the book examines what @entity2 sees as the failure of politicians to use history and strategy to predict the implications of present or future military actions			1
@entity2 , who is @entity9 's @entity130 claims that politicians and the public have become used to quick - fix wars that are essentially an extension of policy			1
' using war did deliver			0
the wars were pretty short , the @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , so people lulled themselves into an expectation that war was simply a continuation of policy and that it was successful			0
but it has n’t been since 9/11 , ' he said			0
@entity2 believes that civilian politicians have become too controlling of their military staff and leaders and do not allow them to give honest advice			2
no action : @entity152 , @entity26 --- residents search for survivors after what activists said were air strikes by forces loyal to @entity26 's president @entity68 in the @entity161 neighbourhood of @entity152 december 28 , 2013 he is particularly critical of the sacking of general @entity164 after he seemed to be disparaging about his commander - in - chief in a @entity167 article			0
' the concern about the military speaking out shows a lack of democratic and political maturity			0
we ’re not facing the danger of a military coup			0
' the professional experts , who deal with war all the time , should be able to express their views all the time , openly and coherently , just as you would expect a doctor or a teacher to express their views coherently about how you run medical policy or teaching policy , ' he said			0
@entity2 does not keep his criticisms solely to president @entity0			1
@entity4 's prime minister @entity186 speaks in the @entity187 - where he lost a crucial vote in august to take the @entity4 to war against the regime of president @entity68 of @entity26 he says that @entity4 prime minster @entity186 's defeat in a parliamentary vote to launch military action on @entity26 ' absolutely illustrated the failure to think through the strategic implications of his own actions , ' said @entity2			1
indeed , @entity2 calls to mind the example of @entity4 wartime prime minister @entity198 , a former soldier himself , who enjoyed frank and open discussions with his military staff			1
' soldiers have a duty here as well — if they just say , ‘ yes mr. prime minister or mr. president , we can give you exactly what you want , ’ then they ’re probably not being very honest			1
