@entity0 have stepped up the role of sports psychologist @entity2 by asking the @entity3 to concentrate his efforts on the @entity6 first team			1
the 42 - year - old quit his successful role as manager of the @entity11 team recently to spend more time in @entity12			2
and he admits he has hit it off with coach @entity14 to such an extent he has stepped up from working with development players to assist the first team			1
sports psychologist @entity18 has been asked to concentrate on the @entity0 first team by @entity14 a prominent figure on the touchline before saturday ’s 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity23 , @entity2 flew to @entity24 after the game and told @entity27 ’s @entity26 : ‘ since the new manager has come in he wants me to work pretty much exclusively now with the first team			1
i work on the psychology things with players			1
‘ we are very like - minded in our approach			2
other than the fact i was very defensive and he is very offensive , the principles are exactly the same			0
‘ and that is what he wants , high - octane football , energy , workrate , a lot of preparation and a lot of offensive energy going forward – taking the game to the opposition			0
‘ that ’s the style of play he brought from his previous club and he wants to implement that			0
‘ if you take that philosophy forward there are a lot of demands within it			0
the energy levels can sometimes become a problem so the key thing for a manager is that the players are happy and have high energy levels			2
‘ if you want to train at 100 per cent every day and work hard every day and want high energy on the pitch and in drills then you have to be demanding			0
that ’s why my role has become more important			0
if it was a situation where he was n’t demanding that much it would be a bit easier for the players			2
’ brought to the club by major shareholder @entity77 under @entity79 ’s tenure , @entity2 quit @entity11 after their @entity81 final loss to @entity82			1
@entity18 was brought to the club by @entity77 under @entity79 's ( above ) tenure admitting his role at @entity86 has evolved significantly , he added : ‘ when i first went to @entity0 initially it was for players who were very close to getting into the first team			1
can we bridge that gap and get them over the line and take them into the first - team set - up ? ‘ from that point we tried to put a lot of systems in place to develop the players			2
in soccer a lot of it is about opinions , so when i went there based on my own sports science and psychology and coaching background i wanted to try and make it more objective			0
‘ to try to develop key performance indicators that would give us a reading on players on a consistent basis			2
that has been rolled out now from the under - nines up to the under - 20s			0
’ @entity18 has also developed links with @entity120 ’s victorious @entity119 captain @entity118 and was spotted at @entity121 for last month ’s win over the @entity123			1
@entity18 was spotted at the @entity119 last month as he developed links with @entity118 ‘ @entity118 ’s father @entity124 is an ardent @entity11 supporter , ’ he explained			1
‘ @entity124 called me up and said @entity118 would like to meet me			1
‘ i wanted to meet him , he wanted to meet me as well			0
@entity118 had just managed @entity81 in the @entity125 and wanted a handle on team dynamics because golf is an individual sport ‘ he had spoken to @entity130 and @entity131 , but was interested in what we had done with @entity11 and interested in man management and what we had done with players and building relations and stuff			1
‘ i went down and met him and there was a match on the tv			0
it was @entity144 time , it started at 8pm and i did n’t leave until three in the morning			0
our relationship has really grown very strong			0
‘ there has been a lot of speculation about what i was doing with the @entity119 team			1
but the reality is that i probably have leant on @entity118 more than he has leant on me because he has been a very good source of counsel as issues came up			1

@entity2 was working with development squad before
says he hit it off with @entity14 who wants his players well drilled
@entity18 worked at the @entity119 with @entity120 captain @entity118
