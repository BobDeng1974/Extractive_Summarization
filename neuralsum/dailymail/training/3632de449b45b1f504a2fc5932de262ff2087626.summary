by @entity0 published : 06:46 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 4 february 2013 plans to give hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies to @entity4 tobacco farmers have been criticised by anti-smoking campaigners			1
the tobacco growers could get the extra cash as soon as next year after members of the @entity9 voted to make changes which would allow member states to decide which crops receive @entity14 farming subsidies			1
the old system was phased out in 2010 at a time when tobacco farmers in 12 @entity14 countries including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were receiving around £ 260million in subsidies			1
back to the old system : millions of pounds in subsidies could be given to @entity4 tobacco farmers but after it was scrapped , tobacco farming across the @entity14 declined			1
it is now feared the proposals could result in huge sums going back to tobacco growers			2
@entity29 , the environment secretary , told @entity31 : ' subsidising @entity20 and @entity19 tobacco growers is clearly wrong			0
environment secretary @entity29 has criticised the plans ' not only would it take us back to the dark days of skewing the basic laws of supply and demand , it would also spend @entity41 taxpayers ' money on a product that is of absolutely no benefit to our society			0
' anti-smoking campaigners have said the plans are ' wasteful ' especially as the @entity47 is currently running a campaign to encourage smokers to give up cigarettes at a cost of £ 27million			2
@entity52 , chief executive of @entity53 , described the move as a step backwards and that the plans made no sense at all			2
she also urged @entity58 and the @entity47 to reject the proposals when they are ratified further			0
a spokesman for the @entity47 said the committee 's proposal was unlikely to happen			0
tobacco growers have been looking at other ways of using tobacco other than cigarettes and in @entity19 a perfume has been manufactured called @entity68 and @entity69			0
the perfume comes in a box with a photograph of three cigars entwined with roses			0
tobacco is responsible for more than 650,000 deaths in the @entity14 every year .			1
