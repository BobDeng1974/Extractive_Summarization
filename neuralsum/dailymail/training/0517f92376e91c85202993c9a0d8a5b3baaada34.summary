the following morning she started complaining of feeling light headed and was struggling to catch her breath			0
she said : ‘ i thought it must have been an infection i had picked up from my son @entity71 , who is three			0

the nurses were congratulating me , and i did n’t know what they were talking about it			0
‘ they showed me photographs that they had taken and told me that the baby was mine			2
i told them they were mistaken , that i did n’t have a daughter			2
‘ then they showed me a scrap book that they had put together during the two weeks since her birth			0
i just could n’t believe it			0

’ mrs @entity5 was finally allowed home a month after giving birth			1

it took me a few months to get used to being a new mum again			0
‘ it ’s amazing to think how @entity15 came into the world			2
even when i was unconscious , my body knew what to do			0
i ’d love to be able to remember giving birth to her , but i ’m just grateful that we are both alive and healthy now			0
