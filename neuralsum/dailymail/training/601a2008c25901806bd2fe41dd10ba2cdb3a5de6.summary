royal officials were accused of ‘ insulting the war dead ’ yesterday after installing a portable lavatory at a war memorial where a wreath from prince @entity5 is on display			1
the ugly temporary lavatory and workmen ’s canteen at the @entity10 – 100 yards from @entity11 – provoked complaints from families who went there to pay their respects to family members who died in two world wars			1
the structure was put there by @entity21 chiefs who say it is needed while repairs are carried out to the memorial – but they could not explain why the @entity26 portable lavatory was not placed a discreet distance away			1
the temporary toilet block has been placed beside the @entity10 in @entity29 wreaths from @entity5 and other vips were laid at the memorial on @entity33 earlier this year , and thousands of people from @entity10 countries have visited the site in recent weeks to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity39			1
the memorial in @entity41 , by @entity42 , was unveiled by the @entity43 in 2002			2
yesterday , @entity45 - born baroness @entity44 – a friend of @entity46 – who led the campaign to raise the £ 2.5 million to build the memorial , said : ‘ to put an eyesore on this memorial is an insult to the brave men and women from the @entity10 who died for this country			2
‘ it is beyond belief that anyone should do this at any time , let alone so close to the commemoration of the @entity39 when this matter is so close to everyone ’s hearts			0
it should be moved away where it does not desecrate this sacred and beautiful monument			0
i ’m sure the @entity43 would be horrified if she knew about it			0
’ a @entity21 spokesperson said they were conducted work at the site in advance of @entity73 one @entity10 visitor to the memorial told @entity76 : ‘ i was very disappointed to see a portable toilet at the memorial			1
i tried to complain about it but could not get through on the phone			0
’ another said : ‘ i just do n’t understand why anyone would build a wonderful memorial like this and then spoil it so thoughtlessly			2
there is plenty of grass in the park to the side of the memorial			2
if they had a little sensitivity , they would have put it there			0
it ’s the product of the jobsworth mentality			0
’ hours after @entity76 contacted the @entity21 , officials made an apology and a team of workmen was sent to ‘ smarten up ’ the temporary fixture			1
a @entity21 spokesman said yesterday : ‘ we are sorry and are trying to make the works more in keeping with the park and memorial			1
there are workmen down at the site at the moment making sure that the repairs are more in keeping with the memorial			1
’ the spokesman said the repairs were needed to make the site ‘ look its best ’ for @entity73 celebrations in november			0
the @entity10 commemorate the five million people from the former @entity117 , including the @entity45 subcontinent , @entity119 and the @entity120 , who fought for @entity122 in the two world wars			0
it lists the names of the 74 @entity10 volunteers who were awarded the @entity126 or @entity127 in the conflicts .			0

the toilet has been situated just 100 yards from @entity11
