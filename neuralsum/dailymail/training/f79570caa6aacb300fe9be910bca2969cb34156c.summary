@entity1 's fears about the @entity3 surface appear set to be realised after the @entity5 team trained inside the stadium on friday night and claimed the centre of the pitch was ' completely ruined '			1
@entity1 has been concerned about wear and tear on the pitch after a series of three @entity13 games in recent weeks , culminating when the @entity14 and the @entity15 clashed on sunday			1
more worrying for @entity1 and his @entity37 team will be the state of the turf			1
it appears perfectly clear on the wings , because the @entity13 play on a narrower pitch , but a strip down the centre looked heavy and was cutting up last night after a day of steady rain as the @entity5 trained			2
the @entity28 markings and damage caused to the centre of pitch are clearly visible @entity5 midfielder @entity50 stays out of the middle while dribbling on the pitch the area in the centre - circle was the worst of all			2
it is not a return to the bad - old days when the pitch inside the new stadium was a complete embarrassment , but one of the @entity5 backroom team said : ' the centre of the pitch is completely ruined			0
there is a 10 metre square of grass where there is no grass at all			0
' @entity1 aired his thoughts last weekend , claiming the pitch was ' not in the best of nick ' and met with stadium officials to clear the air , as @entity3 confirmed more @entity28 fixtures for next autumn			1
@entity17 boss @entity77 shrugged off the poor playing surface at @entity3 the pitch looked heavy and was cutting up after a day of steady rain as the @entity5 trained @entity17 boss @entity18 said : ' if there is rain or it is muddy it is , up to a point , an advantage for the team that is defending because the ball is harder to control			1
but i do n't care			0
' the pitch will be in the same condition for both teams			0
we must play here and we ca n't change			0
it is the same for all the players if the pitch is bad or super or synthetic			0
