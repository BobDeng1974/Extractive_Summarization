sitting with a set of felt - tip pens and a book full of black line drawings just waiting to be filled is most children 's idea of heaven			1
but now thanks to an illustrator and designer from @entity9 , @entity10 , colouring in is the latest stress - busting hobby for adults			1
@entity14 , 36 , is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume @entity18 , filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes , patterns and shapes			1
' and the art book , which was published in august last year , has achieved unheard levels of success , selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages			1
the success of @entity18 's has come as a huge surprise , not least to @entity14 herself			1
' my illustrations are a real labour of love , they take a long time and i think people really can and do appreciate that , ' said the former art teacher			2
' because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book			2
' this is why i would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market			0
' this coloured - in image of a dragonfly taken out of @entity18 shows the vibrant level of detail an image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna @entity14 has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , but it 's her best - selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame			1
in 2013 , she was approached by @entity83 , her now - publisher , to see if she would be interested in doing the book			1
she took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia			2
she explained : ' i would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in			0
' it 's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today 's busy and fast paced world			2
a bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of @entity14 's illustrations this blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in @entity14 worked from her studio in @entity9 , @entity113 , to create her range of detailed illustrations ' colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the ' grown up ' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress			1
a little bit of escapism if you like			0
' and reviewers have taken to the @entity128 @entity127 site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits			2
one user commented : ' received this book yesterday and have n't stopped since			0
' i 've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work			0
the pics are amazing an the paper quality is good			0
i have already completed four pics in one day ! ' ' colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the ' grown up ' world ' : the 36 - year - old illustrator ( pictured ) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic the book , @entity18 , retails at £ 3.99 and is currently at the top of @entity127 's @entity149 list the @entity113 illustrator has said that , although it is mostly adults buying the book , the influence of @entity18 is widespread			1
she has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings			0
' from parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring , to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision , ' said @entity14			2
many fans are busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family			0
@entity14 says that @entity18 is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness , while there are , ' ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club ! ' @entity14 agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books , could be down to their therapeutic quality			1
she explained : ' i think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them			0
' in that sense i think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to ' switch off ' as they become really absorbed in what they 're doing			0
' the artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images			0
this image of striking stag was created by the @entity113 designer out of detailed fauna line drawings plenty more fish in the sea ! @entity14 's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations she said : ' i also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it			1
' someone said to me that with @entity18 they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book			1
' i think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish			0
