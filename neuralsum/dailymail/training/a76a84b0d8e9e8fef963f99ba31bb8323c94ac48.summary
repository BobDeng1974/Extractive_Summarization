by @entity0 it could be the future of warfare and even help fend off pirate attacks			1
@entity4 today revealed new video of a laser weapon so powerful it can pierce the hull of a boat within seconds			1
the weapon works over a distance of a mile , and could one day be fitted to ships			2
it has a tracking range of more than 5 kilometers ( 3.1 miles )			0
the system has been designed to be flexible enough to operate against rockets as a standalone system and to engage unmanned aerial systems with an external radar cue			0
the defence giant is developing the transportable , ground - based laser system to demonstrate a practical , affordable defense against short - range threats , including @entity42 - like rockets , unmanned aerial systems and small boats			2
in tests off the @entity50 coast , the @entity4 prototype laser system successfully disabled two boats at a range of approximately 1.6 kilometers ( approximately 1 mile ) , the firm confirmed today			1
these were the first tests of the @entity52 ( @entity25 ) system against maritime targets			0
the defence giant is developing the transportable , ground - based laser system to demonstrate a practical , affordable defense against short - range threats , including @entity42 - like rockets , unmanned aerial systems and small boats			2
' in less than 30 seconds , the ground - based system ’s high - energy laser burned through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military - grade small boats operating in the ocean , ' the firm confirmed			1
the system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 5 kilometers ( 3.1 miles ) , and its 10 - kilowatt fiber laser can engage targets up to 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) away			0
' our adam system tests have shown that high - energy lasers are ready to begin addressing critical defense needs , ' said @entity76 , president of @entity77 , @entity78			0
the laser locks on to the boat , allowing it to begin fiting the boat quickly catches fire , and begins to sink ' putting revolutionary technologies to work in practical applications is a hallmark of innovation at @entity4			1
' designed for short - range defense of high - value areas including forward operating bases , the @entity25 system ’s 10 - kilowatt fiber laser is engineered to destroy targets up to 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) away			0
the system precisely tracks targets in cluttered optical environments and has a tracking range of more than 5 kilometers ( 3.1 miles )			0
the system has been designed to be flexible enough to operate against rockets as a standalone system and to engage unmanned aerial systems with an external radar cue			0
' our laser weapon initiatives leverage commercial products and processes , focusing on affordability for the user , ' said dr. @entity107 , @entity4 senior vice president and chief technology officer			1
' @entity4 continues to invest in advancing fiber laser and beam control technologies , as these successful @entity25 tests demonstrate			1

weapon tested by @entity4 off the @entity50 coast
was able to track and destroy a small boat in less that 30 seconds
could be used to fend off pirate attacks
