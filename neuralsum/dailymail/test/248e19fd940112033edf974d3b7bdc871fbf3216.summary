last night , @entity56 , a solicitor from @entity57 and @entity58 representing several of the peer ’s alleged victims , said : ‘ they will be asking how a man who lacks the mental capacity to stand trial has sufficient capacity to give valid instructions to transfer his assets			1
‘ it will be of great concern to them to see what may be their last opportunity to achieve any sort of justice deliberately obstructed			0
‘ the court would be asked to look at any transactions undertaken in recent months which could constitute efforts to defraud potential creditors			0

it would be looked on very critically by a court of law			0
