court case : businessman @entity1 developed a brain tumour after 12 years of using a mobile phone six hours a day a court has ruled that mobile phones can give you cancer in a landmark case that could open the gates for other victims to take legal action			1
businessman @entity1 , 60 , was diagnosed with a brain tumour after using his mobile phone at work for up to six hours a day for 12 years			1
@entity16 's @entity15 found that there was a ' causal link ' between his phone use and his illness			1
experts now predict a barrage of legal claims by victims who believe their own illness was caused by their use of mobile phones			1
mr @entity1 told @entity29 newspaper : ' this is significant for very many people			2
i wanted this problem to become public because many people still do not know the risks			0
' i was on the phone , usually the mobile , for at least five or six hours every day at work			1
i wanted it recognised that there was a link between my illness and the use of mobile and cordless phones			2
' parents need to know their children are at risk of this illness			0
' oncologist and professor of environmental mutagenesis @entity50 and neurosurgeon dr @entity52 gave evidence supporting mr @entity1 's claim			2
they argued that mobile and cordless phones emit electromagnetic radiation causing damage to cells and increasing the risk of tumours			0
but they added that many tumours do n't appear for 15 years making short - term studies on mobile phone use redundant			1
the jury is still out , however , for many scientists who claim it is still unknown what , if any , link there is between mobiles and brain tumours			0
landmark ruling : @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity74 found there was a ' causal link ' between mr @entity1 's phone use and his brain tumour - opening the doors for other legal claims earlier on this month , a @entity82 study on more than 358,000 mobile users over 18 - years - old found that those who used mobile phones for 10 years or more were no more at risk than those who never used them			1
researchers led by the @entity89 in @entity90 found cancer rates in the central nervous system were almost the same in both long - term mobile phone users and non-users			1
but other scientists disagreed , saying the @entity82 study excluded business users and included as non-users people who began using mobiles later on			0
the big debate : the jury is still out for many scientists who argue there is no evidence to support a link between cancer and mobile phone use @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 said the study was ' worthless ' , and the researchers themselves admitted non-users may have been misclassified which would bias the findings			1
he said : ' this seriously flawed study misleads the public and decision makers about the safety of mobile phone use			2
' professor @entity108 has previously advocated cigarette - style warnings on mobile phone packets and urges more independent research			2
he said : ' vast numbers of people are using mobile phones and they could be a time bomb of health problems - not just brain tumours , but also fertility , which would be a serious public health issue			0
' the health effects of smoking alcohol and air pollution are well known and well talked about , and it 's entirely reasonable we should be openly discussing the evidence for this , but it is not happening			0
' we want to close the door before the horse has bolted			0
' the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) rang alarm bells last year when it classified mobile phones as ' possibly carginogenic '			0
in april , @entity146 conference highlighted figures published by the @entity148 , which showed a 50 per cent increase in frontal and temporal lobe tumours between 1999 and 2009			0
the @entity148 figures showed that the incident rate has risen from two to three per 100,000 people since 1999 , while figures from @entity156 showed a one to two per cent annual increase in brain cancers in children			0
but earlier this year another study by @entity162 researchers found no statistically significant change in rates of newly diagnosed brain cancers in @entity166 between 1998 and 2007 - saying it was unlikely ' we are on the forefront of a brain cancer epidemic ' .			1
