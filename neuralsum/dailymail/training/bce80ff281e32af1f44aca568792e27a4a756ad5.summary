challenger ? @entity0 , a favourite of @entity3 's @entity2 wing , is widely tipped as a future @entity3 leader if @entity5 slumps to defeat in may @entity2 mp @entity0 is being widely tipped as a future @entity3 leader if @entity5 slumps to defeat in may , it emerged yesterday			1
the @entity9 mp is a member of a ‘ breakfast club ’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary @entity12 , shadow housing minister @entity14 , and shadow education secretary @entity13			1
all four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in @entity16 before meetings of mr @entity5 ’s shadow cabinet			1
many mps from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the @entity23 / @entity22 wars of the past if @entity3 does n’t win in may			1
a clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers			0
other challengers are likely to include @entity32 , the party ’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at @entity36 last year			0
mr @entity32 ’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the @entity41 from further privatisation			1
shadow home secretary @entity43 is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a @entity3 loss			1
her husband , shadow chancellor @entity47 , stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily			0
yesterday the @entity49 on sunday reported miss @entity0 , a @entity50 mp , had emerged as the favourite among @entity2 impressed by her tv performances			1
it was also suggested that the quartet of @entity2 will unite to try and block mr @entity32 , and suggested mr @entity12 would also be a likely candidate			2
other @entity3 mps are said to prefer the prospect of a joint ticket involving mr @entity13 and shadow work and pensions secretary @entity58			2
last week miss @entity0 raised eyebrows by challenging mr @entity5 ’s position on the private sector providing free @entity41 services , declaring : ‘ what matters is what works ’			2
her tone was markedly different from that of both mr @entity5 and @entity3 health spokesman @entity32			2
miss @entity0 , 43 , also defended middle - class voters with ‘ sharp elbows ’ who demand the best from public services			0
she said : ‘ i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with making sure that our @entity41 needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else			0
’ ' @entity80 ' : miss @entity0 is a member of a quartet of @entity82 along with , from left , education spokesman @entity13 , business spokesman @entity12 , housing spokesman @entity14 mr @entity5 has accused the government of ‘ privatising and fragmenting the @entity41 ’ , while mr @entity32 has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed			0
but in an interview with political magazine @entity88 , miss @entity0 insisted : ‘ there will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the @entity41 or challenges to the system			0
i believe what matters is what works			0

@entity9 mp was only elected to the @entity100 in 2010
but she is *influential* among @entity3 's @entity2 right - wing
she has supported the *inclusion* of privatisation in the @entity41
