@entity0 have demanded ' compulsory training ' for mobility scooter drivers after a shock figures revealed three people a @entity5 are being injured in accidents involving the 10mph disability buggies			1
in total , 164 accidents involving mobility scooters were recorded last year â€“ including five drivers who were killed , 17 who suffered serious injuries and a further 102 who sustained ' slight injuries '			1
nine more people , who were not the driver , were seriously injured after being hit by a scooter - and another 31 people slightly injured , the @entity17 has revealed			1
mobility scooters are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the @entity22 but experts said the true figure is likely to be far higher , because the crashes were only recorded by less than half of police forces			1
the vehicles , intended for disabled people and have a top speed of just 10mph , are cheap to run , do not need tax or insurance , and can be driven without a licence			2
they are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the @entity22 , giving the police limited powers to prosecute dangerous driving			0
@entity39 , mp for @entity40 , has spoken out over the growing menace caused by some drivers and accused the government of not taking the dangers seriously			0
the @entity46 mp has written to transport minister @entity47 to express her concern at the danger posed by the growing number of mobility scooters			2
more than 300,000 people are now thought to use mobility scooters in the @entity54			1
transport secretary @entity55 is under pressure to introduce ' compulsory training ' for mobility scooter drivers ms @entity39 says an ageing population will fuel the growth of scooters , and wants more stringent checks in place			1
she has also previously raised concern over able - bodied youngsters using mobility scooters as a cheap alternative to running a car			2
she told @entity69 in 2012 how she spotted one youngster spotted ' cruising along the seafront at a @entity73 resort ' with his golf clubs on the back			0
but ms @entity39 is convinced accidents are on the increase			0
she told the @entity78 : ' with more and more mobility vehicles on the roads , the lack of knowledge amongst some users regarding safety and visibility , and in some cases poor roadworthiness , are all potential causes of accidents leading to injury and death			2
' if the growth in numbers continues at the current rate then the government must take action			0
the public seem to agree			0
' we need to know who is using these vehicles and training on purchase , whether privately or from a shop , should become a mandatory requirement			0

in total , 164 accidents involving mobility scooters were recorded last year
