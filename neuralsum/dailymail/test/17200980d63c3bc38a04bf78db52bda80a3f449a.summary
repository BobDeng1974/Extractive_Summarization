there are up to one million free - roaming dogs on @entity3 's streets who are being hunted down by ' dog catchers ' and stuck in squalid state - run pounds where ' they are waiting to die '			1
the ' euthanasia ' of strays was legalised by the @entity3 parliament in september 2013 to help reduce a massive overpopulation			1
but a group of former models called the @entity14 have rescued hundreds of dogs from the streets where they would be savagely killed - and re-homed at least 700 in the @entity18			1
the @entity14 claim government funds for programmes aimed at neutering the animals were never implemented and the animals were dealt with in the ' most cruel way '			1
@entity24 , @entity25 and former @entity27 model @entity26 are devoted to saving the mistreated dogs - and finding them loving homes			1
@entity24 told @entity47 : ' @entity3 's stray dog situation is probably one of the worst in @entity83 and sad , neglected , hungry animals are a part of @entity3 landscape			2
she says the ' killing law ' was passed following an ' isolated incident ' in 2013 , when a four - year - old boy was mauled to death by a pack of ' vicious stray dogs '			2
adding : ' tens of thousands of animals have been caught by dogcatchers and killed in most horrific ways			0
' it is common in @entity3 for them not to use a euthanasia injection , but instead dispose of dogs in cheaper ways such as injecting paint thinner into the heart , strangling , clubbing to death			2
' the founders of @entity14 describe the pounds as ' filthy , dirty , short on food ' and in truth - just a place to dump these dogs so they die away from the public '			1
here , the dogs suffer from mange - a skin disease caused by parasitic mites - and fights between them erupt regularly			0
despite the harsh conditions they are subjected to , the animals who are lucky enough to be alive still vie for the @entity14 ' affection when they are eventually rescued			2
animal charity @entity120 - which has helped neuter around 150,000 stray dogs - says the situation for dogs became much worse when the killing law was introduced			2
its spokesperson @entity125 told @entity47 : ' dogs are brutally rounded up by dog catchers and taken to pounds where they are subjected to poor conditions and cruel treatment , and are essentially waiting to be killed			1
' the organisation responsible for catching the dogs estimated that they had captured around 25,000 stray dogs in @entity135 alone since the legislation was passed , and overseen the killing of around 16,000			0
' the organisation successfully convinced the @entity139 to suspend the legislation last summer , but they say the brutal situation on the streets remains the same			0
killing : the @entity3 government implemented the culling programme to stem the overpopulation of stray dogs but a @entity148 report says killing the animals will not solve the problem humane : @entity38 ( pictured ) and the @entity14 have so far re-home at least 700 dogs in the @entity18 and spayed thousands more change : their @entity155 - based charity 's website is full of pictures of once - doomed dogs who have found happy homes in the @entity18 inspiration : the @entity14 were formed when @entity25 ( left ) saw of a picture of a desperate @entity3 stray on @entity163 and decided to do help with her friends @entity24 and @entity38 ( right ) found : like the @entity14 , charity league of @entity167 has also rescued hundreds of stray dogs like @entity169 ( pictured ) from @entity3 's streets happy home : @entity172 - who was found malnourished in the back of a rundown car - is now living comfortably in the @entity18 desperate : they also found @entity176 ( pictured ) at a train station in an appalling condition and a severe wound on her left paw happy ending : @entity176 - whose leg was crushed - is one of the lucky ones to be rescued but 16,000 dogs have been culled since it was legalised at the end of 2013 inspired : the @entity14 were forged when tv wildlife presenter @entity25 saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of @entity3 on @entity163 earlier this month , the charity found evidence of a massive and illegal cull of stray dogs in the small southern town of @entity196			1
they discovered dozens of dead dogs with visible wounds on their heads and bodies left to rot in black bags in the forest			0
' this is another serious violation of the law on stray animals and proof that , although the killing law has been repealed since june 20 , 2014 , ' @entity120 said			0
the cull is supposed to reduce the overpopulation of stray dogs in the country but a @entity148 report claimed : ' in none of the study areas did the elimination of dogs by any method ( catching , shooting or other ) have any significant long - term effect on dog population size			2
' the @entity14 were forged when tv wildlife presenter @entity25 saw a photograph of a desperate stray dog on the streets of @entity3 on @entity163			1
it was the plight of that dog - named @entity224 - that inspired the trio to officially form the organisation in november 2011			0
their petition to calling on the @entity230 to investigate the ' disappearance ' of the public funds designated for a neutering programme has gained over 28,000 signatures			1
gruesome : charity @entity120 discovered dozens of dogs with severe wounds to their head and bodies in the a southern @entity3 town grotesque : while another charity @entity241 claim to see piles of dead dogs left on village roads a rescue worker with @entity241 said they regularly see piles of dead dogs left in the middle of village roads when they patrol the south - west of @entity3			0
its spokesperson @entity252 told @entity47 : ' the scenes are such that alive dogs and some puppies were eating from the other dead dogs within the pile			0
' we asked someone who said they saw a large truck passing by at 3.30am that night who dumped the pile and left			0
' we called our local police right at that moment and the answer was ' so what do you want us to do ? ' ' with the euthanasia law or without , it the slaughter in @entity3 public shelters or streets will continue			0
' between march and may 2014 , a team of investigators from @entity120 investigated 43 public shelters in @entity3 â€“ from around 81 currently registered with the @entity3 vet authorities			0
the results of the investigation were shocking as they found that not one of these public shelters in @entity3 conformed to the law regulating the national programme on stray dogs .			1
