@entity0 ? nothing more than a dickensian demagogue			2
' television and radio presenter @entity0 , who lost his @entity58 slot over prank calls to actor @entity60 , made his name in stand - up			2
@entity0 joined the likes of @entity10 and @entity7 on the 50 - strong list of great minds but the millionaire 's attempts to re-brand himself as an anti-capitalist revolutionary have seen him accused of hypocrisy			1
last december @entity70 branded him a ' hypocrite ' after he accused the comedian of accepting large @entity74 film salaries whilst campaigning against the @entity23 political system			0
