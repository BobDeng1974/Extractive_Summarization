@entity1 sporting director @entity0 has revealed the confusion and mayhem that followed @entity5 's accident on the opening lap of sunday 's @entity8 @entity7 helped wreck @entity11 's race			1
@entity11 admitted he was " very lucky " as a stray tyre from the 150mph , 47g impact of @entity5 's @entity13 into a metal guardrail flew over his head after hitting the front - left wing of his car			1
believing his race to be over as he was unsure of the damage , @entity11 returned to the pits when he instead should have lined up on the grid as the race had been red flagged			1
the 23 - year - old had to wait at the end of the pit lane whilst the field toured behind the safety car for a lap , only being released once they had filed past			0
as further punishment for entering the pit lane under a red flag , @entity11 was handed a stop - go penalty , eventually finishing the race in 16th and two laps down on race winner @entity52			1
explaining @entity11 's difficulties , @entity0 said : ' @entity11 unfortunately got caught up in that accident where @entity5 went off			1
blunder : @entity11 went in to the pits while the red car was out , incurring a stop - go penalty ' the car sustained some damage , and although it was only to the front nose , it was unclear at the time , so he called to pit , but then obviously the race was suspended			1
' when the red flags come out you can not then enter the pits , but by that stage it was too late as he 'd already committed to coming in , so he was then stuck between a rock and a hard place			2
' it was a bit a double whammy as he had to start at the end of the pit lane , and on the resumption of the race behind a safety car which does a lap , you are a lap down			0
' you only start when the last car goes past the end of the pit lane and the pit lane exit lights go green			0
' then , of course , he received a penalty because it 's very clear in the sporting regulations you ca n't pit when a race is suspended			2
battling back : the young @entity88 eventually finished 16th despite losing time ' it was unfortunate the way the timing all worked			2
' @entity0 concedes the volume of radio traffic further clouded matters , adding : ' there were a lot of things going back and forth			0
' first of all there was the shock of the accident , and secondly he was trying to feel the extent of the damage to the car , and then the red was thrown in the middle of that			0
' potentially it could have been a really nasty accident for @entity11 because there were some bits flying around , and he just appeared at the wrong time and the wrong place			0
it was one of those things			0
