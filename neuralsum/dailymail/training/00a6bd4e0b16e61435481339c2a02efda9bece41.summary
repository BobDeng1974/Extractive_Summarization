by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 unrepentant : mr @entity3 , his wife @entity4 and their terrier chippy yesterday the @entity8 politician who complained about @entity9 sending aid to ' @entity11 ' stormed out of a tv interview after being repeatedly challenged over whether he is racist			1
@entity13 @entity3 declared last night that sending aid to @entity15 was ‘ treason ’ and said he had no idea why he ca n’t refer to the continent as ‘ @entity11 ’			1
repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a racist , mr @entity3 told @entity21 interviewer @entity20 : ‘ move on , there ’s a good fellow			1
if you ’re not going to move on to serious issues , i ’m not going to continue – i ca n’t be bothered with it			2
’ he then tore off his earpiece and stormed off			1
it was an abrupt ending to a day of @entity30 farce as mr @entity3 engaged in a whirlwind tour of radio and television studios , repeatedly defending himself and making the case against overseas aid			1
a fresh storm erupted over comments he made opposing women quotas on boards of top city firms , arguing men and women were very different			0
' most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man , most men can reverse a car better than a woman , ' mr @entity3 suggested			1
he has previously suggested that he wanted to deal with women 's issues because : ' i just do n't think they clean behind the fridge enough			2
' a former economist , he was elected as an mep in 2004 and has been making headlines ever since with his views on women , climate change and @entity59			2
but he was slapped on the wrist by party leaders after he was secretly recorded making what critics immediately branded racist comments			1
he told supporters in the @entity66 that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘ @entity71 sunglasses , apartments in @entity73 , @entity74 and all the rest of it ’			2
in the recording , the mep for @entity78 and the @entity79 says : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we ’re in this sort of debt to @entity11 is completely beyond me			1
’ @entity8 leader @entity84 ordered mr @entity3 to stop using the term and the under - fire @entity13 issued a carefully - worded statement apologising if he had caused ‘ genuine offence ’			1
@entity88 weighed into the row today , branding mr @entity3 's remarks ' offensive ' and defending the use of @entity9 taxpayers ' money for overseas aid			1
he said : ' i think it is an offensive remark anyway , but what i think is wrong is this sort of " stop the world , i want to get off " approach just does n't work			1
' @entity9 is a very open international country			1
the problems elsewhere come and visit us			0
so it makes sense i think to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve these problems at source , ' he told @entity110			2
going : mr @entity3 starts to get annoyed during interview with @entity21 ... going : the mep whips off his earpiece ... gone : and waves goodbye to interviewer men are from @entity115 and women are from @entity117			1
or in @entity3 's case , men are better at reversing cars while women can find condiments in the pantry and fret about wet towels left on beds			1
the bowler - hat wearing 63 - year - old as gained a reputation for his outspoken views			2
his latest musings on the differences between the sexes emerged in an article railing against setting quotes for the number of women on the boards of @entity139 companies			0
mr @entity3 argued that women have a ' genetic predisposition ' to prioritise family over working hard			1
' most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man , most men can reverse a car better than a woman , ' he said in an article			0
' men and women care about different things on a micro-scale			0
leaving the lavatory seat up , wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad			0
' a man simply can not understand what the problem is			0
most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility			0
' men can not see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight			2
' he also boasted of being ' just about as @entity176 ' as a man can be			0
' i am not a ' new man ' , would not be caught dead at the birth of a baby and [ would be ] happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer , ' he said in the article last month			0
he also lashed out at modern feminism ' spawned in the bra burning 1970s by rather shrill , bored , middleclass women of a certain physical genre '			0
he said they represented few women but are now supported by ' the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach '			0
but mr @entity3 has refused to say sorry and insisted he had not done anything wrong			1
‘ what i ’m not doing is apologising , ’ he said			0
last night an unrepentant mr @entity3 said he did not understand why mr @entity84 had censored him			1
he added : ‘ i did n’t feel i had done anything wrong , i mean , i ’m 63 years old , that ’s the sort of phraseology we used years ago			1
‘ he ’s a younger man than me and i do n’t see it that way but if he tells me it ’s so , it must be so			0
’ asked by the @entity110 where ‘ @entity11 ’ was , mr @entity3 said : ‘ i do n’t know where @entity206 is either – there is no such place of course is there ? like the @entity212			1
where is the @entity212 ? ’ later he conceded : ‘ it might have been misconstrued by president @entity215 , he may have thought i was talking about him			0
‘ if he is offended , i shall write to his excellency in short order and say , “ i ’m very sorry i was n’t talking about you ”			0
@entity220 is president of @entity221 , not @entity222			0
in another interview , mr @entity3 said the government was committing treason by sending taxpayers ’ money abroad while things were so tight at home			1
he said : ‘ if you ’re fed up with £ 1billion a month going abroad with no audit trail when we ’re cutting our police and hospitals , vote for me			0
if you do n’t believe that ’s treason – treason , i use the word advisedly – that ’s how i feel			2
’ the original recording was leaked to the @entity242 newspaper , and a bullish mr @entity3 declared : ‘ look , my job is to upset the @entity242 and the @entity110 – i love it , i love it			1
i do n’t do political correctness			0
’ he added : ‘ when a country has a trillion pounds of debt and we ’re cutting our hospitals , our police force and we ’re destroying our defence services , that money should stay at home			0
‘ people who want to give money to worthwhile charities , that is for the individual citizens			0
it ’s not for the likes of @entity88 to pick our pockets and send money to charities of his choice			1
’ he added : ‘ there are people in this country who ca n’t get treatment for cancer			0
there are people who are waiting in a queue for dialysis machines			0
money should stay at home			0
' i ’m standing up for ordinary people at the pub , the cricket club , the rugby club , the sort of people who remain completely unrepresented under the political system that we have			2
’ the son of a @entity284 fighter pilot , mr @entity3 – known to friends as ‘ @entity286 ’ – grew up in @entity287 and spent 40 years working as an economist in the @entity289			1

mr @entity3 drifted into politics after being asked to write a research note on the single currency in the mid- 1990s			1
‘ i gave it ten years before it started to inwardly collapse , ’ he recalls			2
‘ i ’ve been proved right in spades			0
’ mr @entity84 , then a @entity289 colleague and drinking companion , persuaded him to join the party			0
he was elected as an mep in 2004			0
@entity300 , from campaign group @entity299 , said mr @entity3 ’s comments were ‘ incredibly damaging ’			1
she added : ‘ it is highly offensive and what he meant by it is n’t important – it ’s the outcome that ’s important			2
’ shadow international development secretary @entity305 said : ‘ these are an offensive and narrow - minded set of remarks			1
’ mr @entity84 tweeted : ‘ @entity309 per cent right over foreign aid budget but pleased he ’s apologised over the wrong language he used			2
’ but within two hours , mr @entity3 was back on the television declaring that he had no idea why ‘ @entity11 ’ was considered racist			1
‘ i was describing corrupt despots across the globe who have no audit facilities at all , who either spend the money we give them on arms or they misdirect it , ’ he said .			0
