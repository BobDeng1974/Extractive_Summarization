by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 's leading aid charity is facing an inquiry by watchdogs after launching an extraordinary attack on the @entity8 ’s austerity measures			0
@entity9 infuriated conservative mps by unveiling a mock film poster on @entity12 , accusing the government of creating a ‘ perfect storm ’ – involving high prices , unemployment , zero - hours contracts and childcare costs – that is ‘ forcing more and more people into poverty ’			1
charities are barred by law from political campaigning and @entity25 mp @entity24 said he had asked the @entity26 to launch an urgent investigation			1
the @entity9 @entity12 advert has been criticised by @entity25 mps who warned the charity would lose support a spokesman for the watchdog said it had begun an assessment – a first stage of a process which could lead to full inquiry			1
a government source rejected the claims by @entity9			2
he said : ‘ i think they ’ll find unemployment is falling , that we ’ve just taken action over zero - hour contracts , and that there was a @entity48 in the @entity49 which will offer tax - free childcare to all parents with kids under 12 by autumn 2015 and cover 85 per cent of childcare costs of those families receiving universal credit			0
’ mr @entity24 said : ‘ most of us operated under the illusion that @entity9 ’s focus was on the relief of poverty and famine overseas			2
‘ i can not see how using funds donated to charity to campaign politically can be in accord with @entity9 ’s charitable status			1
’ @entity25 mp @entity24 condemned the ' foolish ' campaign which he said would lose @entity9 support ‘ this has lost you a lot of supporters			1
’ he has now written to the @entity26 requesting an investigation into the ‘ overtly political ’ attack on ‘ the policies of the current government ’			2
he questions whether the advert is breach of @entity9 's charitable status			2
the @entity25 are particularly angry at the inclusion of unemployment and high prices in the list			1
' this has lost you a lot of supporters			0
very @entity85 , mp according to the latest figures , unemployment is down by more than 400,000 in the last two years			0
inflation has also fallen in recent months , with wages now rising at the same rate as prices			0
@entity92 , a @entity25 mp , accused @entity9 of using ‘ anecdote to create alarmist generalisations ’			1
@entity25 mp @entity95 said : ‘ @entity9 is a charity			1
they are barred by law from political campaigning			0
’ but @entity98 , @entity9 campaigns and policy director , said : " @entity9 is a resolutely non-party political organisation - we have a duty to draw attention to the hardship suffered by poor people we work with in the @entity3			0
" fighting poverty should not be a party political issue - successive governments have presided over a tide of rising inequality and created a situation where food banks and other providers provided 20 million meals last year to people who could not afford to feed themselves			0
" this is an unacceptable situation in one of the world 's largest economies and politicians of all stripes have a responsibility to tackle it			0

@entity25 mps slam ' foolish ' campaign and warn it will cost the charity support
@entity26 asked to investigate if @entity9 has breached rules
