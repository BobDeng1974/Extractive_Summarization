@entity0 certainly need to discover some star quality during the one - day series against @entity3 — although the nearest they have come so far is @entity5 all - rounder @entity4 being in the same class at @entity7 in @entity8 as pop royalty @entity9			1
@entity4 left the school and @entity9 , as @entity9 was then , at the age of 16 when he won a sports scholarship to @entity14			2
pop idol : the @entity17 and @entity0 one - day all - rounder went to the same school in @entity8 as @entity9 umbrella - ella - ella : @entity9 was known as @entity9 at the school , which @entity4 left at the age of 16 @entity21 : rihanna on stage at @entity25 's @entity24 last year down under : giving the fans what they want in @entity29 in october @entity31 quality : @entity4 went to @entity7 before leaving on a sports scholarship the travails of @entity0 ’s besieged cricket captain @entity34 include a commercial deal that has landed him in trouble with the @entity37 and the @entity38			1
after the @entity40 success last summer , @entity34 became an ambassador for upmarket menswear brand @entity42 & @entity43 and is the face of their winter campaign , modelling a range of clothing			2
but the deal clashes with @entity0 ’s clothing partnerships with @entity51 and adidas and a communication breakdown between the @entity37 and @entity34 ’s agents @entity55 meant it was n’t established if it conflicts with his central contract obligations			1
you wear it well : @entity34 's sponsorship deal with @entity42 & @entity43 has upset the @entity37 and the @entity38 to add to the fuss , both the @entity37 and the @entity38 have intellectual property rights issues with the @entity42 & @entity63 branding and pictures including the @entity66 badge			2
the wrangling has gone on throughout the 5 - 0 ashes whitewash and proved an avoidable distraction for the @entity0 captain , whose mind looked scrambled by the @entity72 where he was twice out cheaply			1
the @entity37 are intent on protecting their sponsorship partners ’ rights but a spokesman said : ‘ we hope we can come to a settlement soon that will be agreeable to all parties			0
’ sir @entity80 , @entity0 ’s legendary warrior all - rounder , may be mortal after all			1
he suffered a heart problem during the second test at @entity84 while working for @entity85 and later missed a day ’s cricket to have defibrillator treatment			1
however , the brief health setback has n’t stopped @entity80 working and playing hard , as well as promoting red wine from wherever he might be during the innings interval of @entity92 @entity91 ’s @entity94 coverage			0
warrior : but @entity0 legend sir @entity80 did n't let a heart problem stop his @entity40 commitments @entity98 , who is seen by a number of cricket pundits as the man to replace beleaguered @entity0 team director @entity102 , also has @entity3 ’s @entity104 tv network after his services			1
@entity98 , who made his debut on @entity107 during the @entity40 , impressed enough for the @entity92 to want to use him on @entity109 matches as well			0
@entity110 , who is not going to win any ‘ him or me ’ confrontation with @entity102 , continues to infuriate senior members of the @entity37 with his ‘ man apart ’ attitude			0
this includes refusing to drive a sponsors ’ @entity118 to @entity0 matches like the other centrally contracted players — preferring his own ‘ @entity121 tractor ’ — so that he does n’t have to commit to any @entity118 personal appearances			1
and this at a time when the @entity92 cricketers ’ availability to sponsors and media is in marked contrast to @entity0 ’s insular approach			0
lone ranger : @entity110 continues to infuriate the @entity37 with his ' man apart ' attitude former @entity134 commercial chief @entity133 may have jumped before he was pushed			1
his role had been under scrutiny since the @entity134 lost a bumper title sponsorship with @entity138 at the last minute and had to replace it on reduced terms with @entity140			0
@entity133 , who applied for the ceo ’s post that went to @entity143 , also has n’t delivered a promised play - off sponsor			0
fans of @entity147 clubs will have to get used to plenty of midweek games in 2015 - 16			0
@entity85 , faced with a void in their football scheduling when @entity155 screen @entity153 and @entity156 , will move as many major @entity134 clashes as they can away from the weekend			2
floodlit capers : @entity160 's @entity159 ( left ) and @entity162 's @entity161 will have more midweek matches missing from the corporate junketing around the @entity166 and @entity29 @entity165 were the all - party parliamentary cricket team , who were @entity169 during the previous two @entity40 tours			0
it is understood they were unable to find enough sponsorship for another trip , with the focus on @entity177 ’ expenses .			0
