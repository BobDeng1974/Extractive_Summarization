by @entity0 published : 14:43 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 18 april 2013 a home owner is being forced to trespass to reach his front door because the council sold his front garden			1
@entity5 and three neighbours were shocked to learn in february that strips of land they 'd rented for the last 25 years in @entity10 , @entity11 , were being sold			1
the sale has now taken place and the neighbours say they are locked in an ' anxious waiting game ' as they still have no idea who won the bid and what lies in store for their gardens			0
@entity5 , 41 , is now technically trespassing on his front garden , which is the only way he can access the front door of his property			1
' i will be trespassing to get to my own front door ' : homeowner @entity5 in his front garden in @entity10 @entity28 shot showing the land the council is selling , including the strip giving access to mr @entity5 's home before the sale went ahead he said : ' i would technically be trespassing across someone else 's land to get to my front door			1
what if the owner refused to let me access my own home ? what would i do ? ' four strips of land in @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 in @entity10 were sold at a @entity48 auction in february for Â£ 4,800 to a private bidder after @entity50 put them up for sale			1
@entity53 , 61 , of @entity44 , said : ' @entity55 over the road has got to walk over that land every day to get to his house , and you never know the new owner could just turn around and forbid him access			1
' since the auction we have heard nothing from the council and are still none the wiser about who owns it			2
it 's just a waiting game to see who turns up and what they decide to do			0
' the worst thing is , whatever happens we have no control over it and have to look down on it from our windows			0
' ' someone could pitch a caravan in my front garden and i would be powerless ' : @entity53 in front of the land despite being located on three separate roads , the plots were sold as a single lot in the sale by @entity85			1
the four families , who had been renting the land for up to 25 years , rallied together to bid for the plots but were outbid but an unknown buyer			1
@entity90 , 65 , of @entity45 said : ' we are all really anxious to find out what 's going on			0
' all we know was it was sold to a private individual			0
we wanted to try and buy it but there was a limit to how much we could afford especially considering solicitors fees and insurance , which is a shame			0
' @entity101 : @entity102 and @entity90 of @entity45 on what used to be their garden auction : the four families tried to buy the land but were outbid buy an unknown buyer an @entity50 spokesman ' while we appreciate the residents ' situation , the land concerned is @entity50 land , and this would have been made clear when the houses were bought			0
' @entity50 , through our agents , visited all of the auction sites and where possible made contact with all those with an interest in the land			0
' @entity50 is awaiting completion of the purchase through the buyer 's solicitors , and once the sale is complete the owner 's details will be a matter of public record at the @entity133			2
' in the meantime , the council provided the buyers ' solicitor 's details on 3rd april to a @entity10 resident following a direct request			2
it is usual for the buyers to be represented by a solicitor or agent , and we can not force a third party to talk to the residents			0
' furious : resident @entity149 in front of the land that @entity50 has auctioned off @entity5 , @entity149 , @entity53 , and @entity90 and @entity154 , left to right , say the first they knew was when the auction brochure arrived earlier this year			2

@entity5 has to walk across someone else 's property to get to front door
the council sold the front garden he has rented for 25 years
now he fears the new owner will deny him access
