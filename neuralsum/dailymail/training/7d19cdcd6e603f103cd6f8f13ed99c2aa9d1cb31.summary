@entity5 , 23 , was captain of her university hockey squad when she was struck down with @entity7 syndrome however , ms @entity5 , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has not only learned to walk again - she is now running around the hockey pitch again			1
she said : ‘ @entity18 has been my passion since i started secondary school , and i was devastated when i thought i would never be able to play again			0
‘ i spent most of my spare time playing , and my social life revolved around nights out and trips away with the team too			2
‘ when i was discharged from hospital , i was in a wheelchair , and i had to learn to walk all over again			2
‘ i am a determined person , and i thought if i can learn to walk again , i can run			0
she started to feel unwell after returning from a holiday with her hockey team			2
she is pictured just weeks before she was admitted to hospital ‘ it 's taken a long time , and it 's been a very difficult journey			0
i was very out of breath and unfit after my first practise , but it 's come back to me so naturally			0
' ms @entity5 was studying photography at @entity37 when she was struck down with @entity7 during the summer holidays			1
@entity7 syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the @entity42			1
symptoms , including pain , tingling and numbness , begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs			1
it can also cause muscle weakness , co-ordination problems , paralysis and even death			0
the exact cause is not known , but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection			0
it attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system , including the motor nerves , used by the brain to control muscles			1
around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome			2
the condition occurs when the body 's immune system attacks part of the nervous system			1
it is not known exactly what causes it but about 60 per cent of cases develop after a viral or bacterial infection			0
it is thought that the infection may trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves			1
about 80 per cent of sufferers make a full recovery but 20 per cent are left with problems such as an inability to walk , loss of co-ordination and loss of balance			0
after a week away with her hockey team , ms @entity5 began suffering flu - like symptoms , and getting pins and needles in her feet - but put it down to over exerting herself on holiday			1
but more than a week on , her symptoms had continued to worsen and doctors thought she had swine flu			0
ms @entity5 said : ‘ i had come back from holiday feeling really rough , and i thought i 'd just over-done it			1
‘ but after a week , my symptoms were getting worse , and i felt terrible			0
‘ my gp told me he thought i had swine flu , and i was given @entity108 , but a few days later , i got up in the night and my legs just gave way under me			2
‘ my mum had to pick me up and carry me to the bathroom , but the doctors refused to come out and see me because they said i was infectious			0
‘ my symptoms carried on getting worse , and my legs just could n't support my own weight			2
doctors initially thought that ms @entity5 had swine flu and said that she should be put in isolation as she was infectious she was eventually diagnosed with @entity7 syndrome when she lost the use of her legs and struggled to move her arms ‘ eventually , a doctor did agree to see me			1
he arrived wearing a face mask and protective clothing - but he soon realised i probably had something more serious than swine flu			0
’ ms @entity5 was taken to hospital by ambulance but was not allowed in for more than an hour as they thought she was infectious and had to prepare an isolation ward			1
within a few days of being in the hospital her breathing had become weak , she was struggling to move her arms and she could n’t move her legs at all			1
when she was discharged from hospital she needed a wheelchair and had to have months of physiotherapy and rehabilitation at this point she was finally diagnosed with @entity7 syndrome and she spent a month paralysed in hospital			1
ms @entity5 said : ‘ when i tried to lift a glass of water to my lips , i 'd just throw it in my face - i had no control over my limbs and it was really frightening			2
‘ i was told that some people never fully recover , and there was a chance i would never walk again			2
‘ fortunately , i began to recover some movement in my legs just a few weeks after my treatment started			0
ms @entity5 says that her hockey coach ( pictured ) and all of her team mates were very supportive when she was ill she has now made a full recovery and is back on the hockey pitch as well as working as a professional photographer ‘ i was warned that although i would probably walk again , i may never recover enough strength to be able to play sport			1
‘ i was absolutely devastated			0
playing sport is who i am , and i was determined i was n't going to be beaten			0
’ after leaving hospital , ms @entity5 was admitted to a rehabilitation unit , where she began daily physiotherapy			1
for six months she had to visit the hospital regularly for follow - up treatment			0
just a year after being hospitalised , ms @entity5 graduated with first class honours in photography lucky : one in five people never fully recover from @entity7 syndrome she returned to university that autumn using a wheelchair , and slowly relied on it less and less			1
however , it was 18 months before she could do away with the chair altogether			0
just a year after being struck down with the illness , she graduated with first class honours - and has since started work as a professional photographer			0
