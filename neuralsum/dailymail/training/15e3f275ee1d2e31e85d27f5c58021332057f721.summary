by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:54 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 4 november 2013 fanatic fiasco : @entity4 gave police the slip by entering a @entity8 mosque in his regular clothes - then leaving disguised in a burka a new tagging fiasco has plunged the monitoring of @entity14 ’s most dangerous terror suspects into chaos			1
three men who were accused of tampering with their supposedly state - of - the - art monitoring equipment walked free from court after their lawyers successfully argued the tags were ‘ faulty ’			1
one of the men – @entity23 - trained fanatic @entity4 – was last night the subject of an international manhunt after going on the run only a few hours after the case collapsed			1
after being freed , the 27 - year - old jihadist gave police the slip by entering a @entity8 mosque in his regular clothes – then leaving disguised in a burka			1
lawyers for the @entity35 - born @entity14 citizen had claimed he had damaged his electronic tag when kneeling down to pray			1
the other two men involved in the tagging case are a fanatic linked to the foiled 2006 airline liquid bomb plot and an @entity42 explosives expert			1
the shocking revelations have led to a review of the tagging regime			2
last night there were also demands from @entity47 for the burka to be banned			2
@entity50 mp @entity49 said the burka had proved the ‘ most complete disguise for a @entity54 terrorist suspect ’			1
on a day of drama at @entity57 , home secretary @entity55 appeared before mps to explain what had gone so badly wrong with the monitoring of @entity4			0
he is linked to the @entity63 terror group and is accused of plotting attacks against @entity66 interests in @entity67			1
@entity4 was under a terrorism prevention and investigation measures order , or @entity70 , to restrict his movements			0
along with eight other men who are the subject of a @entity70 , the conditions included wearing a new @entity76 electronic tag , which allow their every step to be tracked on a computer screen			1
@entity4 , along with two other terror suspects , was accused of tampering with his tag – a crime which potentially carries a five - year jail term			1
but last week the case against all three men collapsed when the @entity86 said there was insufficient evidence			1
defence lawyers say that the cases had to be dropped because the design of the new tags is flawed			1
they say that the tags do not appear to have been stress - tested to cope with a devout muslim who prostrates himself in prayer five times a day			1
faulty : @entity4 , along with two other terror suspects , was accused of tampering with his tag			1
but their lawyers successfully argued the devices were damaged by the stress of the five - times - a - day @entity54 prayers caught on cctv : @entity4 entered the @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity8 , at 10am			1
he was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka ( right ) it was in the immediate aftermath of the verdict in his case on friday that @entity4 entered the @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity8 , at 10am			0
he was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka			0
@entity35 - born @entity4 , 27 , has been linked to the @entity35 terror group @entity63 – the extremists behind the @entity118 mall massacre – and is accused of plotting attacks on @entity66 interests in east @entity67			1
it is understood he took part in terrorist training in 2008 and is believed to have helped various individuals travel from the @entity14 to @entity35 to allow them to engage in terrorism - related activity			1
@entity4 , who is 5ft 8in and of medium build , is also suspected of helping to plan attacks in @entity35 and overseas , including an attack intended for the @entity129 in @entity130 in 2010			2
he is thought to be a member of a @entity14 - based network which had access to money , false passports and documentation , as well as equipment , and is understood to have procured funds and weapons for terrorism uses for the network			2
it emerged last night that he repeatedly purchased phone cards used to call contacts overseas in the weeks before he fled			0
he bought the international @entity146 cards from a newsagent close to the @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity8 – the same mosque from which he made his escape dressed in a burka last friday			2
the purchase of the phone cards will fuel suspicions he had long been plotting to escape abroad , possibly back to his @entity63 associates in @entity35			1
it was also revealed last night that the son of extradited hate preacher @entity157 is viewed as a local ‘ celebrity ’ at the mosque			0
@entity160 was said to have built up a following at the mosque			0
he has also prayed for holy war in a video uploaded to the mosque ’s @entity166 site			0
the case immediately led to an on - going international manhunt			1
security officials fear he may already be overseas			0
in the @entity173 , shadow home secretary @entity172 demanded to know the role the tagging fiasco had played , asking : ‘ why did the government drop the case ? were the tags faulty ? ’ she also attacked the @entity179 which the @entity180 introduced as an alternative to @entity183 ’s control orders			2
@entity4 is the second man to flee while under a @entity70 in only ten months			0
unlike control orders , it is no longer possible for the police and security services to force a terror suspect to relocate to another part of the country and so break up their support network			1
@entity4 , who had originally been subject of a control order and moved out of @entity8 , was allowed to move back when @entity193 came into force in january 2012			2
miss @entity172 said : ‘ this home secretary has made it easier for terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible			2
’ mrs may denied @entity179 had put the public at risk and said @entity4 ’s tag was thought to have be working correctly when he absconded			0
officials were aware he may have gone on the run on friday afternoon and began urgent work to track him			0
his identity was made public on sunday night			0
the @entity207 said it was investigating whether ‘ a very small number of gps tags currently in use ... may be overly sensitive to tamper alerts ’			2
█ the @entity212 has opened an investigation into the government ’s multi-million - pound contracts with security firms @entity216 and @entity218 for tagging criminals			2
an audit suggested that the companies had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead , in jail or never tagged in the first place			0
in some cases bills continued to be paid for months or years after tags were taken off , justice secretary @entity225 told mps			2
both @entity216 and @entity218 said they would ‘ co-operate fully ’ with the investigation			0
analysis by @entity231 fiasco : @entity233 's insisting control orders must be significantly watered down may have paved the way for @entity4 's escape from custody it was @entity55 who was dragged to the @entity173 yesterday to explain how another terrorism suspect had been allowed to slip through the net			1
but this is a fiasco covered in the fingerprints of @entity233 , the deputy prime minister			0
when the @entity180 was formed in 2010 , both sides committed to a review of @entity183 ’s controversial control order regime , which allowed fanatics to be placed under virtual house arrest			0
they could be made to stay indoors for up to 16 hours a day , banned from having computers and mobile phones and – crucially – forced to relocate to another part of the @entity14			0
months of wrangling between the @entity50 and @entity251 followed , with mr @entity233 insisting control orders must be significantly watered down			0
mrs may fought hard on behalf of the security services , but , in order to keep the overnight curfew element of the control orders ( albeit reduced to ten hours ) , she was forced to sacrifice the power of relocation			0
@entity183 now insists she is paying a heavy price for this compromise – which stripped @entity262 of a powerful tool that could be used to break up terrorist support networks			0
as we report today , @entity4 had previously been the subject of a relocation order when he was subject to a control order			2
but , under the @entity270 regime insisted upon by mr @entity233 , he was free to move back to @entity8 in early 2012			2
would he really have been able to plot his escape – or get away so easily – had he been living in a smaller town or city , without having his associates and support network close by ? what is certain is that he is not the first terror suspect to vanish after having his relocation order quashed			1
@entity279 – an associate of @entity4 , who attended training camps in @entity35 – had been sent from @entity8 to live in the west of @entity282 under the terms of his control order			0
back in the capital , he gave the police the slip by jumping into the back of a black cab in @entity8 ’s @entity290 on @entity291 and has n’t been seen since			1
the fanatic is now understood to be abroad			0
heavy price : but it was home secretary @entity55 who had to answer to the @entity173 about it yesterday mrs may says the scrapping of the relocation power should not be blamed , pointing out that under @entity183 ’s control orders there were seven absconds and six of the suspects were never apprehended			0
currently there are nine terror suspects , including @entity4 , subject to a @entity70 , which are used against those who can not be prosecuted in court because there is insufficient admissible evidence			1
normally , this is because handing the evidence to suspects would expose secret intelligence gathering techniques or put agents ’ lives at risk .			0

three men accused of tampering with tags walk free after lawyers argue it was their regular prayer that *interfered* with the devices
one of them , @entity23 - trained @entity323 , was then able to give police the slip after disguising himself with a full - face veil
the @entity63 - linked terror suspect , who is accused of plotting attacks in @entity67 , is now subject to an international manhunt
