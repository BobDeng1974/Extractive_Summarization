a new @entity1 video that takes a light - hearted look at @entity3 is fast becoming an online sensation and could turn out to be the unofficial national anthem over the summer			1
from backyard cricket with wheelie bins to a gyrating @entity9 of @entity10 , the video has a bit of everything			2
even former prime minister @entity13 and @entity14 make an appearance			1
@entity17 aka coach @entity16 put together the song and video package called ‘ @entity3 ! ’ which is a cover of @entity21 ’s number one 2003 hit ‘ @entity24 ! ’ with appropriate images and lyrics			1
’ then another friend commented : ‘ @entity48 onto it ’			2
‘ from there i went away and wrote the new lyrics , recorded it and made the video – ready for the next @entity39			2
so it was definitely a team effort , ’ mr @entity17 explained			0
‘ i do n’t think any other song could possibly work as well though			2
it hinges on that basic play on words			0
‘ when i started writing the lyrics , i knew that it could easily get carried away with too much negatively and political commentary			0
‘ and although that opens it up for more satire and ultimately humour , i wanted the overarching feeling and message to be positive			0
’ @entity17 aka coach @entity16 from @entity67 put together the song and video package backyard cricket with wheelie bins was another must for the new @entity1 video a video about the joys of @entity3 would n't be the same without a shot of a surfer out on the ocean the 27 - year old is from @entity67 and coach @entity16 is the artist name he uses for performing his electropop music			1
he said that he did n’t usually make parody videos and that his stage name is a character from the 90s film franchise @entity86			0
‘ i ’ve been making music all my life , and releasing my own songs since 2009			0
video editing and musical mashups have always been a hobbies of mine on the side			0
every now and then , all these interests combine into something like this - as long as the idea is right , ’ he explained			0
mr @entity17 admitted there were a lot of topics to cover in the video , but one clip that he felt had to go in was of former prime minister @entity13 ’s infamous hand shake with @entity105 on the eve of the @entity107			1
@entity108 and barbecues are what it 's all about and the new video champions both ‘ i really wanted to put @entity13 ’s cricket - bowling fail in as well , but that would have been a bit too much @entity115 , ’ he said			1
he was also tempted to have a whole section dedicated to @entity9 ‘ shaking it ’ , but it would have meant ‘ missing out on the @entity120 , @entity14 , @entity121 and @entity122 ’			1
mr @entity17 also thought it would be nice to replace the hashtag ‘ @entity127 ’ for a while and use it for something that ’s ‘ ultimately positive and celebratory ’			2
his hope is that the ‘ @entity131 ! ’ video will be the perfect anthem for @entity3 day on january 26			1
no video celebrating @entity3 would be complete without the @entity134 ‘ i 'm hoping that people use it as a form of celebration , especially around the ' @entity39 ' period , ’ he said			1
‘ whether that 's to play the song at parties and @entity143 , sing a long , do their own versions etc. the term ‘ straya ’ has been kicking around for a few years now , and it would be great to use it in a more positive sense this @entity39			1
‘ music is my passion , and i 'm always trying new things and starting new projects			0
i do n't know where any of them will take me , but it 's always fun just to be making music			0

the @entity1 video takes a light - hearted look at *iconic* @entity3 people and places
it could turn out to be the unofficial national anthem over the summer
former prime minister @entity13 ’s infamous hand shake with @entity105 even gets a look in
a whole section could have been dedicated to @entity9 ‘ shaking it ’
it 's hoped that the song will act as a ' form of celebration ' over the @entity39 period
