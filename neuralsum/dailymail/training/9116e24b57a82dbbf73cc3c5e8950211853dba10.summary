with the exception of @entity2 , most women would be wary of letting their boyfriends or husbands serve as their personal stylists for the day - let alone a week - but that is exactly what one writer did			0
after learning that her boyfriend @entity9 disliked her favorite pair of black shorts , @entity13 , 25 , from @entity14 , @entity14 , was inspired to give him complete control of her closet , allowing him to dress her without any limitations for an entire work week			1
' i thought i had red - blooded , heterosexual dudes mostly figured out as far as what they think girls look most attractive in because i ’ve spent a few years as an observant young female , ' she wrote in an essay for @entity27			0
' i was curious to put this to the test			0
@entity9 , who knew nothing about women 's fashion , had to pick out @entity13 's outfits based solely on what he found her most attractive in			1
for his first day of styling his girlfriend , @entity9 chose an a-line , forest green skirt from @entity49 , a loose , black @entity51 t - shirt and a leopard print cardigan from @entity53			1
black stockings and black ankle boots completed @entity13 's look			2
@entity13 noted that she was ' pleasantly surprised ' that @entity9 was mixing colors and prints , and more importantly the outfit earned ' approving stares ' at her suburban office			1
she even got a few compliments in the break room			0
the next day @entity9 dressed her in a stomach - baring , polka dot @entity66 shirt , a pair of grey and white tie dye @entity71 and a denim jacket			2
while the eclectic ensemble made @entity13 embarrassed to go to work , her worries were unfounded			2
tuesday : @entity13 said she was embarrassed to go to work in this stomach - baring outfit that @entity9 put together , but she later received a genuine compliment on her new look from one of her female co-workers wednesday : @entity9 's next look was somewhat of a dud because @entity13 was wary of wearing these old boot cut jeans from @entity84 not only did a co-worker love her pants , she went on to tell @entity87 that she noticed ' something new was going on ' with her			1
' i am simultaneously flattered and also now uncertain of anything i ’ve worn ever , ' @entity13 wrote			2
' the outfits i ’ve worn the past two days have garnered more compliments than any look i ’ve put together for the last month			0
' for the third day of her experiment , @entity9 opted for a casual look , putting @entity13 in ' very old ' old pair of bootcut @entity84 jeans , his baggy @entity101 t - shirt and a herringbone hooded coat			1
the entire look made her feel frumpy and ' mad unattractive ' , and she was shocked to learn that @entity9 was n't a fan of the form - fitting leggings she usually wore			2
the following day , @entity9 stuck with some of @entity13 's favorite wardrobe items and dressed her in a black @entity110 @entity110 @entity109 sweatshirt and her high - waisted black jeans from @entity51			1
@entity13 explained that the playful outfit made her realize she has n't been dressing like herself lately , noting that she has been ' very safe ' when choosing her looks			2
thursday : for day four , @entity9 picked out some of @entity13 's favorite wardrobe staples - a @entity110 cold @entity115 and high - waited jeans from @entity51 friday : on the last day of @entity13 's experiment , @entity9 dressed her in an eclectic outfit , which featured a football jersey , a fur coat and a shocking yellow miniskirt for @entity9 's final day of styling , he paired a @entity125 jersey with a tight yellow pencil mini skirt and a white rabbit fur coat that she recently purchased at a vintage boutique			1
the somewhat over the top outfit was worn to pick up gummy bears at a grocery store before she headed to @entity9 's apartment to hang out			0
' my friend @entity134 told me i looked like an extra in a @entity137 video , ' she wrote			0
' no higher compliment has been paid to me			0
' with the exception of the ill - fitting @entity84 jeans , none of @entity9 's chosen outfits were even close to being failures			0
in fact , many of them earned some unexpected compliments			0
what 's even more interesting is that @entity9 only spent a total of five minutes choosing @entity13 's outfits over the course of five days			1
the next time you 're standing in front of your closet with ' nothing to wear ' , consider calling your boyfriend in for some help			0
@entity159 faced : a year before @entity13 enlisted @entity9 to pick out her clothes , she dressed herself in a simple white t - shirt and form - fitting black pants personal style : she wore a white short - sleeved button down with grey shorts in 2013			1
