other @entity10 families have reported similar raids this summer , leading to the @entity38 to issue a warning last month telling holidaymakers not to stop in @entity6 motorway service areas			1
however , experts in @entity10 have cast doubt over the use of gas by gangs of thieves			1
the @entity48 were travelling to @entity49 two weeks ago when they decided to spend the night in a well - lit rest area on the @entity51 near @entity52 , a garrison town in the @entity54			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ we believe the thieves pumped laughing gas in through the vents to knock us out			1
they then ransacked our motorhome with us inside			2

it is still amazing to think none of us stirred or heard a sound			0

‘ but the worst part is the intrusion and not knowing what happened			0
none of us had any idea it was happening and that is very frightening indeed			0
’ he added : ‘ it was shocking to be the victim of such a crime and it can only be a matter of time before a small child is killed by these thieves as we all know gas kills			2
’ he also called for the @entity6 government to crack down on the crime			0
‘ they treated it as a very mundane crime , but having people in your motorhome gassing you should be treated much more seriously			0
it is only a matter of time before someone is killed either by the fumes or waking up midway through a robbery			0
