these photographs may look like incredible shots taken from telescopes in space , but they were in fact captured by amateur astronomer in his back garden			1
located millions of light years away from @entity9 , the star - studded patterns fill the night sky with array of colours , from purples and pinks to blues and oranges			2
photographer @entity17 captured the images using a specialist astronomy camera attached to a telescope , from the comfort of his home in @entity23 , @entity24			1
these may look like incredible shots taken from powerful telescopes in space , but they were in fact captured by amateur astronomer in his back garden			2
pictured is the centre of the @entity33 galaxy , a spiral galaxy three million light - years from @entity9 in the constellation @entity33 the 61 - year - old sales manager said : ' my pictures are all long exposures of galaxies , nebulae and star clusters , which range in distance from thousands to many millions of light years away from @entity9			1
' my image of " the @entity47 's @entity46 " is the furthest away , and contains many galaxies in excess of 70 million light years away from @entity9			2
' in distant galaxies , light from many millions of stars takes a long time to reach the @entity9			2
for example , using the @entity54 , astronomers can see the light from the @entity57 , which takes 7,000 years to reach @entity9			0
pictured is @entity59 is a cloud of gas and dust that appears to be forming massive stars			0
at 5500 light - years away , the @entity59 , as it has also been dubbed , is more than three times as distant as the @entity66 , but still close enough for detailed study located millions of light years away from @entity9 , the patterns fill the night sky with array of colours , from purples and pinks to blues and oranges			2
on the left is the the @entity78 and on the right is the @entity80 barely visible to the naked eye on a dark night , @entity81 17 , or the @entity82 , is best seen through a telescope			1
photographer @entity17 captured the images using a specialist astronomy camera attached to a telescope , from the comfort of his home in @entity24 @entity17 has created his own mini-observatory in his backgarden in @entity24			1
it houses an @entity94 12 inch f / 8 @entity93 , a @entity96 @entity95 , an equatorial mount is a @entity97 with the @entity99 - 4000 electronics			0
an equatorial mount is a mount used to follow the rotation of the sky			0
cameras include a @entity105 and a @entity107 monochrome ccd			0
' the idea of gazing up into the night sky and being able to capture these beautiful images that existed way before mankind really fascinates me , ' said mr @entity17 , originally from @entity113 , @entity114			1
' the photographs are all real , but you will not see these images with either the naked eye			0
' our eyes do not have the sensitivity needed to capture the detail and colour			0
' in order to see these very faint space objects and this level of detail , it is necessary to use specialised equipment			0
' in order to capture these images , mr @entity17 attached his camera to a telescope , which is then connected to an equatorial mount along with other equipment			1
an equatorial mount is a mount used to follow the rotation of the sky			0
this rich starscape spans nearly seven degrees on the sky , toward the @entity143 spiral arm and the center of our @entity146 galaxy			0
a telescopic mosaic , it features well - known bright nebulae and star clusters cataloged by 18th century cosmic tourist @entity81			2
still popular stops for skygazers @entity57 , the @entity154 ( far right ) , and @entity82 , the @entity155 ( near centre ) nebulae are the brightest star - forming emission regions the 61 - year - old sales manager said : ' my pictures are all long exposures of galaxies , nebulae and star clusters , which range in distance from thousands to many millions of light years away from @entity9			1
pictured is @entity170 , the @entity170 , located in @entity172 constellation mr @entity17 's set of images are unique because they are captured in one night rather than several			1
he used a fast telescopic lens which collects the light quickly , speeding up the process			1
the amateur astronomer said : ' i 'm constantly monitoring how well the cameras and telescope are when tracking the stars i 'm checking focus and also keeping a close watch on temperature , wind and weather conditions			0
' this hobby is highly subjected to light pollution caused by excessive or inappropriate outdoor lighting			0
' ' my image of " the @entity47 's @entity46 " ( pictured ) is the furthest away , and contains many galaxies in excess of 70 million light years away from @entity9 , ' said mr @entity17			2
this is a stretch of galaxies that forms part of the @entity198 mr @entity17 's set of images are unique because they are captured in one night rather than several			1
pictured is the @entity202 , also known as @entity202 , which is located roughly three million light years from @entity9 in the constellation @entity33 around size light - years wide , @entity204 is located roughly 7,100 light - years from @entity9 in the constellation @entity207			1

@entity17 captured the images using a specialist astronomy camera attached to a telescope
these set of images are unique because they are captured in one night rather than in several sittings

images include shots of @entity202 , @entity236 nebula , @entity78 and @entity82
