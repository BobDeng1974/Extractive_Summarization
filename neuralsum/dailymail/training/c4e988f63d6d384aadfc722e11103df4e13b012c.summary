it must have seemed like such a good idea at the time to the @entity4 team ’s brains trust , pairing the plucky local hero with the seasoned campaigner who can transform himself into @entity7 once every two years			1
unfortunately , nine holes later , @entity8 and @entity9 seemed to be going through some sort of conscious uncoupling , as they fell four behind the youngest ever partnership to take to the course for an @entity18 @entity17 team			1
it was an example of @entity22 - @entity21 collaboration that would have appealed more to @entity23 than the @entity25 campaign , and by the 14th green they were shaking hands with young tyros @entity29 and @entity31			1
@entity4 's @entity9 assesses his options during the first day of the @entity33 on friday @entity9 comes out of a bunker on the third on friday but could ultimately do little to help @entity4 afternoon foursomes scores 1315 : @entity37 and @entity38 vs @entity39 and @entity36 after 18 1330 : @entity40 and @entity41 vs @entity42 and @entity43 - @entity4 win 2 & 1 1421 : @entity44 and @entity45 vs @entity46 and @entity47 - a / s after 18 1436 : @entity48 and @entity49 vs @entity50 and @entity51 - @entity4 win 3 & 2 morning @entity52 0735 : @entity40 and @entity41 vs @entity53 and @entity54 - @entity4 win 5 & 4 0750 : @entity55 and @entity56 vs @entity47 and @entity46 - a / s after 18 0805 : @entity8 and @entity9 vs @entity29 and @entity31 - @entity18 win 5 & 4 0820 : @entity45 and @entity44 vs @entity51 and @entity50 - @entity57 after 18 this looked like an example of modern sport ’s tendency towards paralysis by analysis			1
@entity64 and his five vice-captains must have looked at this from a hundred different angles , and still managed to come up with a combination that simply did not work			0
factors such as @entity8 feeling the pressure in this elevated company before a crowd that yearned for him to succeed , and of @entity9 arriving here with desperately little form appeared to weigh heavily			1
as @entity29 ventured afterwards , it was a major morale booster for the @entity18 to take down the local specialist and the man who has caused them so much misery in recent editions			1
@entity9 even offered an unlikely note of introspection afterwards as he explained that the plan was always for him to sit out the afternoon foursomes instead of trying to play five matches			2
‘ not many people have been able to play five and the reason is it ’s very tiring , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m 38 , we ’ve got some younger pups on the team that might be able to do it better than i can			0
’ @entity9 should not be written off as three times before he has lost his first match before coming back to wreak damage			2
but he has never lost one as heavily as this , unable to contribute so much as a birdie in the course of a 5 & 4 defeat			1
by the time the @entity102 pair slightly revived after the turn , the huge galleries recognised the match as a lost cause and could not muster much in the way of support			0
@entity9 was unable to salvage anything for @entity4 on friday morning , losing a tough 5 & 4 against @entity18 7.35am : @entity40 and @entity41 v @entity53 and @entity36 7.50am : @entity37 and @entity38 v @entity39 and @entity42 8.05am : @entity55 and @entity56 v @entity31 and @entity29 8.20am : @entity44 and @entity9 v @entity46 and @entity47 many duos would have struggled against the @entity18 who , despite being the first @entity18 partnership both aged 25 or below , went round the first 11 holes in six under par , playing with the absence of fear that youth can bring			1
‘ when you ’re playing against guys who are rolling putts in then they are going to be very hard to beat , ’ said @entity9 , who pointed out how they dovetailed			2
‘ they ham - and - egged very well			0
obviously my record has been pretty good and has taken a dent			0
but this is a team game , not just about singling one or two guys out			0
’ you would need a heart of stone not to feel for @entity8 , who was followed round by his @entity17 legend uncle @entity128 , lending his vast experience to his radio commentary duties			1
his nephew admitted afterwards : ‘ your first @entity17 there ’s a bit of excitement and you do n’t know what to expect			2
it took me maybe about five or six holes to get into it			0
i was a bit out of rhythm			0
it was a special reception on the first tee , something that i will definitely remember for the rest of my life			0
’ that was short - lived as he pushed his tee shot wide towards the huge corporate construct and then watched as @entity9 missed an easy two - footer on the first green			2
no amount of adrenaline could get either player going after that , and it may have been that @entity9 was so pre-occupied with discovering any kind of form for himself that he was unable to give his rookie partner the benefit of his experience			0
@entity4 ’s self - styled ‘ postman ’ will want to improve his delivery on saturday			2
@entity4 ’s @entity9 will want to improve his delivery on saturday to live up to his self - styled ' postman ' name			1

@entity9 and @entity8 lost against @entity18 's @entity29 and @entity31 5 & 4 on friday morning on the @entity33 opening day
@entity4 duo fell four behind the youngest ever partnership to take to the course for an @entity18 @entity17 team
@entity44 and @entity9 partnered for saturday morning 's *fourballs* against @entity18 's @entity46 and @entity47
