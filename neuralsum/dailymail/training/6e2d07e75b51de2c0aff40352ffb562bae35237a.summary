the @entity0 has decided not to appeal against the ruling that saw @entity3 seamer @entity2 found not guilty of breaching its code of conduct			1
@entity2 was last week cleared of any wrong - doing by judicial commissioner @entity7 relating to having been accused by @entity8 of pushing and abusing their all - rounder @entity9 in the @entity12 pavilion during the first @entity13			1
only the @entity0 , via chief executive @entity14 , could challenge that verdict - as well as the one that cleared @entity9 of a lesser charge - but after announcing on tuesday that it would consider the verdict , the governing body has decided not to push the case further			1
' @entity14 's refusal to re-open a case that was heard at length via teleconference after last week 's test at the @entity36 finally draws the @entity38 saga to an end			2
the @entity3 seamer , top wicket - taker in the series and man - of - the - match in @entity44 , had been facing a ban of up to four @entity46 if found guilty but can now go into his home match at @entity48 on thursday with no cloud hanging over him			0
free : @entity2 trains with the @entity3 team at @entity48 on tuesday ahead of the fourth @entity13 in the clear : @entity2 could have faced a ban had he been found guilty of breaching the @entity0 's @entity53 the decision will be welcomed by the @entity55 , who were surprised to see the issue escalated so far by the tourists , while @entity8 will be highly aggrieved			1
they have been eager to see @entity2 punished , with captain @entity60 thought to have resisted all attempts to find a diplomatic solution			0
@entity7 ' ruling , which was delivered with surprising speed given the prolonged and exhaustive nature of the hearing , had focused on the lack of decisive @entity69 evidence and the conflicting nature of testimony from the opposing sides			0
as such @entity14 , a trained lawyer himself , saw no benefit to a challenge			2
' it was a complicated and sensitive matter relating to charges brought against two players at different levels of the @entity80 , ' @entity14 noted			1
@entity81 and @entity2 cleared of wrong - doing bitter sweet : jadeja during @entity8 's nets session at @entity48 in @entity84 on tuesday ' there appears to have been vastly conflicting evidence on both sides , with a total of 13 witnesses who gave testimony			2
after carefully considering the decision by @entity7 , whose vast experience was invaluable to the process over recent weeks , we believe that no further purpose would be served by prolonging the process through further appeal proceedings			0
' the disciplinary procedures were robust and transparent and all parties had ample opportunity to ask questions , test the evidence and make submissions			0
we have determined that there is no merit in an appeal and that it would not be in the best interest of the sport to take such action			0
' @entity7 had also called on the @entity0 to look again at their disciplinary code after finding its terms unwieldy in his first appearance as a commissioner			0
@entity14 added : ' as a matter of best practice , the @entity0 will now review the procedures as set out in the @entity53 and reflect upon the comments made by @entity7 in his decision about how a case of this nature might better be provided for in the future			1

chief executive @entity14 decides not to challenge ruling
@entity0 said they would consider verdict , but @entity14 is ' satisfied '
@entity2 and @entity9 both cleared of breaching @entity80
