@entity0 , who won an @entity1 for her role in @entity3 , pointed out the male domination in her @entity1 speech , saying that women were not at the center of most stories in cinema despite this year 's @entity1 successes of films about women , or films starring women in protagonist roles , there are still only as many women in speaking roles as there were in the 1940s			1
a recent study from @entity23 's @entity22 reveals that speaking roles for women of all ages accounted for around only 33 per cent of characters in the top 100 grossing films last year			1
this figure is only slightly higher than the amount of women in major roles back in the 1940s when women played a secondary or minor role in only 78 per cent of the top 100 films of the decade			1
the study , conducted by dr. @entity39 , finds that there has been a 5 per cent increase in women characters in films since 2002 , when women represented only 28 per cent of all characters			1
however , while the amount of women in movies has increased , those taking a protagonist or starring role has decreased , from 16 per cent to 11 per cent over the last ten years			2
women are also likely to be younger than men when playing protagonists , and are more likely to be identified as married or single			2
while recent box office hits like @entity55 were both incredibly financially and critically successful , they are only a couple in the face of overwhelmingly male dominated films like @entity59 of @entity60 and @entity61			0
gravity featured @entity63 in a starring role , with her having almost all the screen time			0
but the film is only one of a few in 2013 to focus on women rather than men compared to the 1940s films like @entity72 and @entity73 , which focused mainly around men , one would think that the amount of women in films has increased			0
but the study suggests the even though more women are directing films today , the portrayal of characters and protagonists are still masculine at the same ratio as the 40s			2
dr. @entity39 , the study 's author , says that the problem is not enough women are working in film behind the scenes			0
she said : ' women comprise one - third to more than one - half of students in top film schools around the country			0
the study showed that women protagonists were younger more often than not , which could explain the popularity and marketability of stars like @entity99 ( left )			1
it also showed that women had to have an identifiable profession more than men , such as @entity63 ( right ) in the film gravity even though there were many women victors at the @entity1 , @entity105 was still an actor that got a lot of credit and will likely go on to get many more speaking roles than his women counterparts ' in genres and venues that are more welcoming of women , their numbers skyrocket			1
' women account for 39 % of directors working on documentaries screening at high - profile film festivals around the country , according to the latest @entity123 study , a far cry from the paltry 6 % working on top grossing films ' the graph shows the portrayal of different character types in the top grossing movies over the last year			2
the disparity is massive , and has changed very little from the 1940s the study also shows the disparity in the different portrayals of characters that could be played by men or women , such as politicians or scientists			0
the study found that these sorts of careers are almost always played by men			0
despite @entity1 successes for films featuring women in starring roles , many of the films , like @entity59 of @entity60 ( pictured ) were very male dominated , which had almost no women protagonists and very few in secondary roles films like the 1941 film @entity72 , which features almost no women , shows how cinema has not statistically changed in the amount of women in speaking roles since the 1940s out of politician characters , 93 per cent were played by men , with only 7 per cent played by women , and men played 70 per cent of scientific or intellectual leaders while women only played 30 per cent			1
the disparity also extends to race , with the study finding that the percentage of @entity170 female protagonists fell hugely in ten years , from 15 per cent to 8 per cent .			0

women are still taking only minor roles in the majority of top films
@entity23 study says women take only 30 per cent of speaking roles
this figure of speaking roles is *unchanged* since cinema in the 40s
women portrayed in films are often younger , and have identified jobs
trend explains popularity and marketability of stars like @entity99
