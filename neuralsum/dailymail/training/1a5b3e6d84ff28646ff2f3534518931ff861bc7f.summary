by @entity0 last updated at 12:44 am on 2nd november 2011 her courage melted the heart of princess @entity4 and helped inspire fellow paraplegic @entity6 actor @entity5 to fight back from the depths of despair			0
now @entity9 , who was paralysed from the neck down at the age of seven in a horrific car crash , again faces one of the biggest fights of her life after revealing she is virtually penniless			1
she won a £ 3.9million compensation settlement in 2000 , eight years after the family car , driven by her father , was hit by a lorry in @entity20 , severing her spinal cord			0
survivor : @entity9 is now facing financial strife after costly care that could have been free from the @entity24 but the cost of round - the - clock medical care , mobility equipment and pioneering treatments has eaten into the payout			1
now miss @entity9 , 27 , is preparing to seek legal advice after learning her local primary care trust should have been paying for her medical care for the past nine years			1
she is relying on a ruling in 2002 which said the @entity24 had to pay for the continuing long - term care of patients despite multi-million pound awards or settlements			1
miss @entity9 says she was not told of this change and continued to pay her £ 100,000 - a - year care bill herself			1
although @entity42 is now paying for her 24 - hour care she says she hopes to get back some of the money she paid since 2002			1
miss @entity9 , who lives in @entity45 , @entity42 , said : ‘ it has been an utter nightmare because i have been funding my own care since 2000			1
touching hearts : @entity9 , pictured in 1995 , won praise from both princess @entity4 and @entity6 actor @entity5 ‘ we have been in a really bad financial predicament , so much so that for the two years until march this year , i had virtually no care			1
’ at the time of her accident in 1992 , doctors said @entity9 would never live an independent life but she was determined to prove them wrong			1
she learned to operate a word processor with her mouth and gained good gcse and a-level results			0
not long after her accident @entity9 wrote to late actor @entity5 after learning he had broken his spine in the same place as her in a horseriding accident , urging him not to give up hope			2
@entity5 said at the time : ‘ this amazing young lady showed me an example of how to cope			0
’ she met the @entity71 , who had heard about the letter , on an official visit to @entity42 in 1995			0
later , at the age of 12 , she took part in princess @entity4 ’s funeral procession			0
miss @entity9 campaigned for spinal research charities , raising more than £ 100,000 , and in 1996 won a child of @entity79			2
expensive care : @entity9 , aged 19 , at the @entity81 in @entity82 having a form of body and mind therapy with instructor @entity86 as well the cost of care , miss @entity9 says a failed business venture , ill - timed share investments and a home education means she is facing a mountain of debt			1
she said : ‘ people ask where all the money has gone			0
but more than £ 1million went on care , more on specialist treatments and day - to - day living			2
i ’ve got some property but that is mortgaged and could be repossessed			0
‘ i did n’t know i could get help with the care costs and , despite being fully aware of my circumstances and previously providing care for me , the @entity42 never came forward to offer me help			0
’ miss @entity9 said her financial situation had forced her to move back with her parents , @entity108 and @entity109 , who have since split			2
with her family : @entity9 posing with her father @entity108 in 2001 she is facing further medical problems after developing a bladder stone requiring surgery which is complicated by her paralysis			1
the stone triggers a blood pressure condition called autonomic dysreflexia , which causes excruciating headaches and can prove fatal if left untreated			0
she is hoping to undergo surgery later this month after the operation was postponed			0
a @entity42 @entity42 spokesman last night said they needed to speak to @entity124 to assess her case regarding her care			0
@entity127 and @entity128 , where miss @entity9 is due to have her operation , said the surgery had been rescheduled to the next available date .			2

@entity9 , now 27 , was *unaware* she was entitled to free care since 2002
she is also now languishing on *waiting* list for life - *saving* bladder operation
