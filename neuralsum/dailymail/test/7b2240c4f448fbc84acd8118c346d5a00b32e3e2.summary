the birth of @entity1 and @entity3 's third daughter was meant to go like the previous two - an intimate family moment that took place in a wading pool their bedroom at home , lit by candles			1
instead , the night turned to tragedy when the little girl @entity13 died either during birth or within minutes afterwards			1
a coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was ' grossly inadequate ' and may have contributed to the death of the baby			1
but in a move many people would find extraordinary , the couple refuses to blame the midwife , and are in fact is defending her actions			2
@entity1 and @entity27 ( pictured with their daughters @entity30 , right , and @entity31 , left ) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner 's report which blames their midwife coroner @entity38 said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the @entity13 's birth , allowed the delivery to take place in ' unsafe conditions ' , and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the @entity47 's baby			1
coroner @entity38 found that @entity13 had died either ' during or shortly after birth ' from meconium aspiration , a condition where a foetus inhales their faeces before birth , preventing them from breathing			1
the report also found that the midwife , who handed in her resignation following the inquest , changed her statement about the events of the evening , including the time of the baby 's birth and whether the baby had exhibited signs of life			1
three years on , the couple , who live on a farm in @entity70 in south - east @entity71 , have spoken about the night @entity13 was born , and what they claim was a tragic and unavoidable event			1
@entity1 , 39 , and @entity3 , 57 , are adamant that @entity13 was stillborn , and that it was very clear from the moment she was born that she had died before birth			1
' we could see a problem as soon as she was born			0
it was n't like i was holding her for a while and then we all of a sudden noticed			0
when she was lifted out of the water and put into my arms she was limp , there was no life in her little body , ' mrs @entity84 , 39 , told @entity90			1
@entity84 with her daughters @entity31 and @entity30 while she was pregnant with @entity13 mrs @entity84 said that her daughter @entity13 was stillborn , and that the coroner 's report which claims she died ' during or shortly after birth ' was fabricated the report found that the midwife changed whether there were any signs of life , and also changed the time of @entity13 's birth from 11.40pm to 11.45pm to cover a seven minute delay in calling for emergency care at 11.47pm			1
' on initial questioning , midwife @entity105 stated that she " was very surprised as things were going well and the baby had a heart rate at birth " , ' the report said			1
' she then stated that " there was no heart rate and no signs of life after birth "			1
' the report also concludes that the midwife allowed mrs @entity84 to give birth at home despite her being at greater risk for meconium aspiration , as a result of her age , the higher end weight of her previous pregnancies , and the fact that she had carried @entity13 for 41 weeks in utero			1
it states that the care the midwife provided ' fell significantly short ' of what would be expected of someone of her experience , and that she had failed to notice meconium in the water when mrs @entity84 's waters had broken as a result of the poor lighting provided by only having candles in the room			1
' there were lights on in the other rooms , but i had chosen to have low lighting to calm me , ' mrs @entity84 said			2
' my midwife also did spot meconium when my waters broke but that was only moments before i actually gave birth			2
when she came out she was stained with it , which means she probably suffered from the asphyxia days before i gave birth			0
' @entity1 and @entity3 on their wedding day ( left ) , and @entity160 with two of the couple 's daughters @entity1 and @entity3 have defended their midwife against the findings of the coroner 's inquest ' we did n't sit around and make a cup of tea deciding whether to call the ambulance			1
as soon as @entity13 came out the midwife yelled to my husband to call them , ' she said			2
the @entity3 's travelled to the @entity177 in an ambulance , where @entity13 was pronounced dead and was taken away for an autopsy after doctors expressed concerns over the actions of the midwife and her sub-standard attempts at cpr			1
the couple said that their daughter was taken off them without their consent , and that they were both traumatised by the knowledge that she was being autopsied without permission			2
' they just took her off us and chopped her up for autopsy			0
it was horrific , ' said mr @entity3			0
' the poor little thing did n't even get to breathe and they were cutting her open , ' mrs @entity84 said			2
the couple said that federal police officers showed up at their house in the hours following the birth and treated their home like a crime scene			2
they said were made to feel like criminals for choosing to have a home birth , and chastised for cleaning up the birthing room which had been wiped down following the birth			2
' it was disgusting the way we were treated , like we 'd intentionally murdered our baby , ' mrs @entity84 said			0
when the results of the autopsy were returned to the family , mrs @entity84 said that she was appalled , and that neither she nor her husband were ever approached for questioning about the events of the night			2
mrs @entity84 said that she and her husband were made to feel like criminals for choosing a home birth ' my only consolation is that i have my two beautiful daughters , ' said mrs @entity84 ' they did n’t once in three whole years contact us to ask for my opinion			1
they did n’t question me , they did n't tell me anything at all			0
you 'd think if they really wanted the truth would they would have asked for my version of events , ' mrs @entity84 said			0
' @entity13 was tragic and devastating and i was lost for weeks , and then for both us and our midwife to be treated like criminals was just too much , ' she said			1
the midwife , who stepped down following the inquiry , was found to not have formal infant cpr training			0
she was cautioned by both the coroner and was reported to the @entity245 , who launched an investigation into her conduct and concluded that the midwife failed to uphold healthcare standards of the profession			1
' i feel like they needed to crucify someone , and they blamed the midwife			0
she is a beautiful person and did nothing wrong , ' mrs @entity84 said			2
' she lost her job over this which is just awful			0
she lost her livelihood for no good reason whatsoever , and apart from us losing our baby that is the most horrible thing that has come out of this , ' she said			0
' nobody is to blame , it just happened			0
it was tragic and devastating but it just happened			0
' mr @entity3 said he wants an apology from the coroner for the claims in the report , and want to see their midwife 's license reinstated without restriction			1
mr @entity3 said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births ' if i had millions of dollars i would sue them for fraudulent proceedings because the document is a fraud , it 's full of contradictions , ' mrs @entity84 said			1
' they made my midwife out to be a complete villain			0
she is a registered nurse and has everything she needs to be a midwife and there is nothing more she could have done , ' she said			0
' my only consolation is that i have my two beautiful daughters , and i do feel @entity13 around me			0
she 's the one who is pushing me to speak out and tell her story			0
' mr @entity3 said that people should have a free and informed choice about whether they choose to have home births			0
' it is so nice to have child born at home , it ’s so much better and familiar			0
people should make up their own mind without interference from the authorities , ' he said			0
the couple are staunchly anti-vaccines , and believe in allowing parents to choose for themselves how their children 's health should be managed .			0
