the princess royal was pictured at @entity1 today , left , looking cool in a pair of sporty sunglasses first worn by her daughter @entity5 , right , during the @entity15 like mother , like daughter : the royal profiles look at same as they pose in the sporty shades so that 's perhaps why @entity27 chose to wear the sunglasses today in the hope they would be a lucky charm for her at the races in @entity34			1
the 64 - year - old grandmother , who is 11th in line to the throne , looked happy and relaxed as she watched the horses compete			0
but while the sun shone causing her to don @entity5 's sporty shades , temperatures remained cool so she stayed wrapped up in a beige double breasted coat , polo neck jumper and red scarf			1
@entity27 looked happy as she watched the races - perhaps the shades were a lucky charm and just like her mother the @entity7 who is rarely keen on a public engagement without wearing hat , the princess wore a brown hat with tartan trim			2
@entity27 , wearing pearl stud earrings , was pictured in the parade ring during the @entity56 at @entity1			2
the event dates back to 1841 and has always been a firm favourite with the @entity60 monarchy			0
one of the races held today is named in memory of the @entity63 who was an avid fan of the sport			0
the royal chats to attendees in the parade ring during the @entity56 despite the sun shining , she still wrapped up in a double breasted coat , hat and red scarf earlier this week , the princess royal opened a new Â£ 2.3m youth arts centre in @entity74			1
the @entity75 was built in a converted church in @entity77 and will include a performance space , studios , rehearsal rooms and a radio station			0
meanwhile , @entity5 is busy training for the 2016 @entity83 with the hope of winning more medals - and perhaps more kit which she can share with her supportive mother .			0
