by @entity0 published : 08:25 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 14 january 2013 moons like the one depicted in the film @entity3 may be among the most common places to find alien life , scientists believe			1
astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life - friendly ' habitable zones ' of stars			1
all are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to @entity16 or @entity17			2
@entity3 was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought			1
while such planets would not themselves be suitable for @entity28 - like life , they could be circled by moons on which there are forests , oceans and living creatures , researchers now believe			1
@entity34 , the fictional moon in @entity3 , is just such a world			1
so far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9 % certainty			1
the rest still fall into the category of ' candidate ' planets while further evidence is collected			2
the confirmed planet , known as @entity47 , orbits a sun - like star in the constellation @entity50 several hundred light years away			0
astronomer dr @entity51 , from @entity52 , a member of the international team behind the discovery , said : ' there 's an obsession with finding @entity28 - like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as @entity47 b is far stranger			1
' @entity16 has several large water - rich moons			2
imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the @entity28 is			0
' if such a planet had @entity28 - size moons , we 'd see not @entity68 and @entity69 but worlds with rivers , lakes and all sorts of habitats : a surprising scenario that might just be common			1

scientists says moons like the one depicted in the film @entity3 may be among the most common places to find alien life , ' it may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around @entity16 and @entity17 - size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system			1
' members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers			0
the @entity100 project invites ' citizen scientists ' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell - tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars			0
follow - up work with the @entity109 in @entity110 provided the proof that @entity47 b is almost certainly a genuine planet			0
more than 40 volunteers are credited in a paper on the research published online by the @entity117			0
one , retired police office @entity118 , 71 , from @entity119 near @entity120 , said : ' it is difficult to put into words , the pleasure , wonderment and perhaps even pride that i have in some small way been able to assist in the discovery of a planet			0
' another , electronics engineer @entity130 from @entity131 , said : ' now when people ask me what i achieved last year i can say i have helped discover a possible new planet around a distant star			0
how cool is that ? ' planet hunters lead scientist professor @entity138 , from @entity139 in the @entity140 , said : ' we are seeing the emergence of a new era in the @entity100 project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars			1
' now , the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet ; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds			0
' @entity3 featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like @entity34 could be the best place to look for alien life before the latest finds , 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones			1
also known as the ' @entity164 ' , this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but " just right " to permit liquid surface water			0
dr @entity167 , another @entity100 scientist from @entity139 , said : ' we can speculate that @entity47 might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life			0
' i ca n't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments			2
' that could happen any day now			0

team say moons similar to @entity3 's @entity34 could be among most common places to find alien life
amateur planethunters have already discovered 15 new planets that could have habitable moons
