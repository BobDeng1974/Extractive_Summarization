@entity0 has declared himself ready to wear @entity2 ’s pivotal fly - half shirt against @entity3 while warning his team - mates to expect a ‘ nasty ’ review following their latest defeat			1
the 21 - year - old @entity8 fly - half was a second - half replacement for cramp victim @entity10 on saturday , and looks certain to make his first start against @entity3 as @entity2 look to salvage some pride from what has been a woeful @entity16 series so far			1
‘ i think i ’m ready , yeah , ’ said the twice - capped playmaker			2
‘ i really want a chance			2
the players i ’ve got around me are very good too			2
@entity0 believes he is ' ready ' to start for @entity2 against @entity3 in this weekend 's international @entity10 has been struggling for form at fly half and could be replaced by the in - form @entity22 ‘ people like @entity10 and @entity25 and @entity26 and the no 9s , with @entity28 ( @entity29 ) and @entity30 ( @entity31 ) , it ’s brilliant to play with			1
‘ we just need to come together as a team and be cohesive and get that understanding together , because in international rugby , more than anything , you need to understand each other ’s games			2
you ca n’t go off on your own , on a tangent			0
’ @entity41 8 @entity40 is also expected to start against the @entity3 in place of @entity43 , while @entity46 blindside @entity44 could replace @entity47			1
@entity43 gave his worst performance for @entity2 and @entity40 will get his chance against @entity3 with ball in hand @entity47 impressed , but he gave away too many penalties and lacked at the breakdown the players and coaching staff will review saturday ’s game at their @entity58 training base on monday and @entity22 expects some home truths to be told following their latest loss			1
‘ i think it will be constructive , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s things that happened against @entity64 that probably happened last week ( against the @entity65 ) a bit			0
‘ for it to happen two weeks on the bounce it could get a little bit nasty			0
but we ’re an honest team , ( we ) stick our hands up and say we ’re going to get better			0
’ @entity29 marked his 50th test with a performance he 'd prefer to forget with @entity2 ’s half backs @entity10 and @entity29 struggling with their kicking game and failing to ignite the backs against the @entity65 and @entity64 , @entity22 could partner @entity76 ’s @entity31 against @entity3			1
‘ we ’re constantly trying to improve , ’ he added			0
‘ we ’ve had a couple of bad results			0
but the only important thing is to come in on monday , learn and get better and try to put it out there next weekend			0
’ @entity10 is short of fitness and struggling with his kicking ... @entity0 's form warrants a shot			1
