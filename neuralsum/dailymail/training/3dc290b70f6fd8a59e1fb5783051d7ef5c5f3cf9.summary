classy on the ball and calm in the tackle			0
@entity42 6 the @entity43 is improving after a difficult start and is beginning to resemble a Â£ 32m defender			0

whipped cross created @entity11 's second goal			2

a wonderful footballer and after hitting his third and fourth goals of the season , he should be aiming for 10 from this campaign			0

@entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) @entity110 5.5 helpless for the three @entity0 goals but otherwise barely tested			1

a difficult day for the midfielder			0
@entity54 shoots at goal but is thwarted by @entity20 and was also unlucky to have a goal ruled out @entity149 5.5 did n't do enough to influence the game in an attacking sense and could have done more to stop @entity114 's forays forward			2
@entity153 5 might have done better with a half - chance in the first half but ran the ball out of play as @entity20 approached but came close with a wonderful acrobatic attempt moments before			0
@entity28 6 more wonderful tricks and by some distance @entity1 's most threatening player			1
palace forward @entity28 was his side 's most dangerous player in @entity162 @entity99 @entity163 ( @entity164 , 68 ) 6 some nice flashes but little of substance			2
