an investigation spanning almost three years into the yearly cost of gun violence covered by @entity4 taxpayers has determined the figure to be over $ 229 billion			1
the new study , by independent political magazine @entity6 , was spawned by the mass shooting in @entity9 , @entity10 , in july 2012 during a midnight screening of @entity12 rises , in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured			2
the magazine says it set out to determine the amount of money the survivors and victims ' families from that one incident would need , based on medical expenses , lost wages , court costs , therapy and impact on quality of life			1
the legal proceedings alone cost $ 5.5 million before the trial of the shooter , @entity31 , had even started			2
shocking : a new report into the annual economic toll of gun violence in the @entity4 determined that taxpayers fork out $ 229 billion annually because of shootings , which is more than $ 700 per person			1
that figure is more than @entity40 's annual revenue of $ 174 billion and the cost of the obesity epidemic , which is $ 224 billion the investigation subsequently expanded to account for all the victims of gun - related violence in the @entity4 based on yearly figures from 2012			1
at least 750,000 @entity4 have been injured by guns over the last 10 years			1
while gun - related deaths seem to be decreasing , with 33,000 each year , gun - related violence is increasing , with 80,000 injured in 2012			1
@entity6 reported the rise of gun - related violence to be up 11 percent since 2011			2
despite this increase , no studies have been undertaken to document the cost to society that such shootings demand			0
last month , a team doctors noted in the @entity57 that the issue is ' a public health crisis '			0
the medical journal also noted that such studies have been avoided because of the influence that the @entity63 and other pro-gun groups have on political leaders			0
the @entity66 of @entity67 called this ' suppression of science '			0
gun violence : although homicides are on the decline across the @entity4 , @entity6 found 80,000 people were injured by guns in 2012			1
the yearly cost to send someone to prison for gun - related homicide is $ 414,000 @entity6 added : ' political forces had effectively banned the @entity80 and other scientific agencies from funding research on gun - related injury and death			1
the ban worked : a recent systematic review of studies evaluating access to guns and its association with suicide and homicide identified no relevant studies published since 2005			2
' to set about its own study , @entity6 enlisted @entity96 at the @entity97			2
@entity96 had undertaken similar investigations since the 1980s			0
they identified two major costs stemming from gun - related violence : direct and indirect			1
direct costs referred to the expenses of someone actually being shot , from emergency service , to police investigations and medical bills , as well as court and prison costs for the assailant			1
taxpayers account for about 87 percent of the direct costs involved in gun - related violence , @entity6 reported			1
based on @entity96 's findings and the 2012 data , it was determined the yearly total of direct costs is about $ 8.6 billion			1
about $ 5.2 billion of this relates to prison costs			2
' the average cost to taxpayers for a single gun homicide in @entity4 is nearly $ 400,000 , ' the study determined			1
' and we pay for 32 of them every single day			0
' for each homicide caused by a gun , the largest direct cost is prison , which costs about $ 414,000 for each person who committed the crime , according to @entity6			1
there are 32 of these paid out every day the second , and vastly more expensive category , is indirect costs , such as loss of income , impact on quality of life and payouts to survivors , victims and their families			1
indirect costs amount to at least $ 221 billion each year , it was determined			1
lost wages alone counts for $ 49 billion of that figure			2
however the $ 229 billion total could be well be higher , because there are factors related to gun violence that could not be counted			1
this includes the massive increase in security at schools across the country since the @entity158 in 1999			0
the federal government has spent over $ 811 million equipping schools with security guards and providing other surveillance - based equipment			0
adding up : the @entity6 study used 2012 data of homicides , suicides , police shootings , and massacres to quantify the effects of gun violence @entity6 included a case study in the investigation , showing the life - long costs of and effects that a random shooting had on @entity178 woman @entity177			1
@entity177 and her husband , both martial artists , were at a drive - thru in @entity182 on november 15 , 2004 , when another vehicle side - swiped their car			0
the driver of the other vehicle got out and fired five shots into the truck that @entity189 and her husband @entity190 were in			0
@entity190 was shot in the head , causing him severe neurological damage and sending him blind			0
he required around - the - clock care			0
@entity177 was shot in the spine and permanently paralyzed from the chest down			0
the shooter or shooters were never caught			0
activist : @entity177 was paralyzed following a random shooting in @entity182 in 2044			0
she estimates the total financial toll the shooting has had on her since the incident to be around $ 5 million			2
adding to that cost , the shooter was never caught and her husband suffered severe brain damage after five months in hospital , @entity177 's hospital bills totaled almost $ 1 million			2
she was dumped by her health insurance provider following the shooting , based on a pre-existing condition , and had to file for bankruptcy			0
she has been hospitalized over 20 times since the shooting and estimates her total bills since 2004 , including wheelchair modifications to her home , a van that she was able to drive with just her hands and physical therapy , to about $ 5 million			0
she is now a high - profile gun control activist			0
' it 's an ongoing battle every day â€” choosing to stay alive , and to continue to fight , ' she told @entity6 .			0

investigation by @entity6 said gun violence costs $ 700 per @entity4 each year , with a total of $ 229 billion
the cost of the obesity epidemic is $ 224 billion
$ 8.6 billion is direct costs , such as prison for those who commit homicide
indirect costs account for $ *169* billion for ' impact on victims ' quality of life '
over 750,000 @entity4 have been injured by guns in the last 10 years
