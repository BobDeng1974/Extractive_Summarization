created : 09:17 est , 22 april 2014 a @entity1 prince has been accused of killing 2,000 birds that are on the verge of extinction while on a safari holiday in @entity6 earlier this year			2
prince @entity9 bin @entity7 - who is commonly known as @entity9 - is said to have killed 1,977 near - extinct houbara bustards while on a 21 - day trip to @entity12 in @entity6 's @entity13 in january			1
an earlier version of this article wrongly included a photograph of @entity18 prince sultan bin @entity17 , who had no connection with the hunting trip			1
at risk : hunting in @entity6 sees the global houbara population shrink by between 20 and 30 per cent annually			1
houbaras are highly valued by @entity25 royals , who consider their meat to be an aphrodisiac an additional 123 bustards - which are covered by laws to protect endangered species - were slaughtered by members of the prince 's travelling party , bringing the total killed to 2,100			1
@entity9 , 63 - the governor of @entity1 's @entity35 and the second eldest son of late crown prince sultan - is accused of hunting illegally in protected areas , according to a report by @entity41 - based @entity40			2
the website claims to have seen a document titled â€˜ visit of prince fahd bin sultan bin @entity7 regarding hunting of houbara bustard ' which they say was prepared by @entity48 - a divisional officer in the local forest and wildlife department			2
the report allegedly says the prince and his party hunted for 21 days - from @entity53 , 2014 to jan 31 - and had been granted special permits by the @entity6 federal government which allow important visitors to bypass laws preventing the hunting of houbaras			1
these permits still require the recipient to kill no more than 100 birds over a 10 - day period however , and only allow them to do so in certain areas			0
it is not known if @entity9 or any or his party will face punishments for violating the rules over how many birds they killed and for hunting with falcons outside the specified areas			0
houbaras are highly valued by @entity25 royals , who consider the meat to be an aphrodisiac			2
for decades sheikhs have travelled to remote areas of @entity6 in time for the bird to make its winter migration from @entity79			0
@entity80 banned the hunting of houbaras in early 1979			0
the ongoing hunting in @entity6 has seen global houbara numbers fall to around 110,000 - with that figure decreasing by between 20 and 30 per cent every year			1
after a particularly aggressive hunting season last year , @entity6 introduced an interim ban on killing the birds			0
the move proved popular with local environmental campaigners who have grown tired of @entity25 sheikhs flouting hunting laws , but the @entity6 government appears to have subsequently eased the restrictions , issuing at least 33 houbara hunting permits already this year			1
one reason they are likely to have done so is because @entity25 royals bring a huge economic boost to the poor regions in which they hunt			0
they are said to travel in a convoy of private jets while on safari , with some transport planes given over purely to falcons and hunting equipment			0
the sheikhs also make large donations while travelling in @entity6 's poor rural areas - paying for new schools and mosques to be built , as well as funding the repair of rundown roads and airports			0
an earlier version of this article wrongly included a photograph of @entity18 prince sultan bin @entity17 , who had no connection with the hunting trip			1
