@entity1 's ultimate vision for this trip involved a series victory , powerful momentum and answers			1
instead , they will arrive home pondering a 3 - 0 black - wash , a telling psychological setback and so many lingering questions			1
a tour that promised so much eventually left the national team with little to show for their brave efforts			2
they departed on sunday in various shattered contingents , minus the results they craved on the scoreboard and in terms of forward planning			2
@entity1 could n’t emphatically tick the boxes marked ‘ present ’ or ‘ future ’			1
@entity23 is renowned for the glass - half - full attitude that he brings to his work , but the head coach was understandably dejected on sunday			1
with the @entity29 countdown in mind , he and his assistants had desperately hunted the landmark win which would have added clout to the notion that @entity1 are re-emerging as a global force in good time for their home tournament next year			1
instead , there were three defeats and the last of them was an unseemly rout			2
@entity42 complete series whitewash questions : @entity45 is helpless as @entity46 scores a try during the tour that disappointed marched : @entity49 walks off the field after being shown a yellow card in @entity1 's 36 - 13 third @entity52 lost failure to stop the @entity55 juggernaut in these parts is no cause for humiliation , given the annual procession of challengers who come here infused with hope , only to retreat with tails between legs			1
in a historical context , this was progress of sorts			2
but @entity1 also sought sign - posts to guide them on their way to the @entity29 and instead they wound up driving into a dense fog			1
for now , confusion has won the tussle with clarity			2
@entity23 and his assistants are seemingly no nearer to knowing the identity of their best line - up			1
if anything , there is more doubt than there was when the extended squad left home in dribs and drabs			0
circumstances have been cruel in conspiring against selection continuity – contributing to the @entity89 procession of contenders moving in and out of certain positions			0
the next time @entity1 are in action is november and their next opponents are the same world champions who have tormented them this month			1
putting aside the small matter of injury disruption , @entity55 are bound to have a reassuringly familiar look at @entity100 , whereas the make - up of the home side is anyone ’s guess			1
in summary , the pack is taking shape , but the back - line remains a morass of dilemmas			1
@entity23 conceded as much as he presented an over-view of the selection out - look			1
‘ once you get the front - rowers back , we ’ve got more depth there now , ’ he said , referring to the absent @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
‘ @entity122 has done really well			0
@entity123 and @entity124 have been bonuses on this tour			0
second row-wise , i think @entity128 has pushed his case forward and losing @entity130 for the third test was quite a hammer - blow in hindsight			1
‘ in the back row , @entity134 was a huge positive and @entity136 again showed consistency at the highest level			0
with @entity140 ’s performance ( against the @entity141 ) i ’m hoping that is going to back itself up next season			0
we will have @entity146 back in the equation as well			0
‘ going through the backs , there are more decisions still to be made , no doubt about it			0
@entity153 , we had a consistent partnership during the @entity155 and they played well			0
it was a difficult task for @entity156 having been out for so long			0
@entity157 was excellent in that @entity141 game so he will come back in the equation			0
but i would still suggest wing is the position really where … there ’s not many @entity164 running around ! ’ hat - trick hero : @entity46 races through to complete a 36 - 13 victory for @entity55 in third test different class : @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 celebrate during @entity42 's third victory the mention of @entity1 ’s try - scoring nemesis was apt. @entity46 has touched down eight times in four matches against his favourite victims			1
what @entity179 would give for such a consistently prolific and powerful attacking weapon			0
one primary problem for the tourists in this series was an inability to match their rivals ’ clinical precision when presented with scoring chances			2
another issue was lapses in @entity192 intensity levels – extending to 10 minutes in @entity193 , 20 minutes in @entity194 and an entire half at @entity196 on saturday , suggesting they regressed in that regard			0
an area of simmering concern is the breakdown , where @entity1 simply could not compete with the @entity202 in the crucial business of poaching turn - overs and denying their rivals quick ball			1
@entity45 delivered an heroic , dominant performance in @entity193 , but the management continued to highlight the fact that as an open - side , they expect more from their captain at the ruck			2
@entity23 pointedly praised @entity45 ’s nominal under - study , @entity140 , for his display in the mid-week win and urged the @entity218 flanker to relentlessly challenge the skipper and create a selection conundrum			2
‘ we need more competition at @entity223 , ’ he said			0
i ’m unequivocal in my mind in that regard			0
brace : @entity46 scored two tries as @entity228 raced to a 29 - 6 half - time lead @entity231 : @entity55 completed a test whitewash and equalled their record of 17 consecutive @entity52 wins ‘ @entity140 delivered a performance against the @entity141 which was exactly the same as the performance he delivered in @entity239 a year ago			1
the problem is we ’re not seeing that level of performance in a @entity218 shirt			0
i ’m hoping he ’ll bottle that , the new coaching staff at @entity218 will get the best out of him and he ’ll remain that consistent presence at the breakdown			0
’ there are other questions up front , but an overall sense of making adjustments from a position of strength , while the same can not be said of the situation behind the scrum			0
at this stage , the only apparent certainty is that @entity260 remains a man apart as the first - choice no 10 and fulcrum of the entire back - line			2
‘ @entity266 is a big loss to your team ’s energy , ’ said @entity23 of the injured @entity265			0
‘ he is a great leader			0
’ @entity271 is surely nailed - on in the team for the time being and @entity274 proved that he must be viewed solely as a midfield force of nature , but beyond that there is only doubt – about personnel and the finer points of the game - plan			2
depending on who starts , @entity1 are still searching for the balance between playing fast - and - loose or falling back on a kick - and - bash approach			1
on the whole , there is far greater depth now in most positions , with the likes of @entity289 and @entity128 among the fringe candidates making a compelling push for @entity29 inclusion			0
but on the flip - side , others who came here may not be seen again			2
it will soon be time for clarity to chase confusion out of town and for @entity1 to start winning these major matches , or they will not be happy guests at their own party next year			1
black - wash ! try heroes @entity46 and @entity170 embrace @entity304 after victory is won catch me if you can : @entity170 race to score a try during an awesome first - half for @entity55 touchdown ! @entity170 scored two tries in the first half as the @entity55 dominated the visitors you beauty ! @entity170 of the @entity55 celebrates with @entity304 and @entity317 after scoring a try sparks : there were flashes of brilliance from some players but @entity1 lost the series 3 - 0 consolation : @entity327 scores a try for @entity1 at the start of the second half powerhouse : @entity331 of @entity55 charges at @entity274 of @entity1 in his first @entity52 start whitewash : @entity331 helped @entity55 to a 3 - 0 test whitewash against @entity1 piledriver ! @entity336 of the @entity55 charges forward during the match in @entity338 all blacks : @entity340 catches the ball as @entity327 challenges him without success best foot forward : @entity344 of @entity1 kicks a penalty to get @entity1 on the scoresheet land of giants : @entity349 of @entity1 takes on @entity350 ( @entity351 ) and @entity352 during the second half eyes wide shut : @entity172 of the @entity55 charges forward past @entity1 's defence			1

the @entity55 defeated @entity1 36 - 13 to complete 3 - 0 series whitewash
@entity55 equalled their own record of 17 consecutive @entity52 wins
