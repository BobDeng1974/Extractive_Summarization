it is the incident the whole world is talking about - yet @entity2 have conveniently left out @entity4 's bite on @entity5 from their @entity8 - @entity7 match report on their club website			1
@entity4 appeared to sink his teeth into the veteran defender 's shoulder during the @entity14 clash yet @entity2 make no mention of it at all in their report			0
@entity8 won the match 1 - 0 through an 81st - minute @entity20 header to book their place in the last 16 , where they will face @entity24			2
the liverpoolfc.com report read : ' @entity4 completed the 90 minutes as @entity8 booked their place in the last 16 of the @entity14 with a hard - fought 1 - 0 victory over 10 - man @entity7			1
' it is the third time which @entity4 has appeared to bite opposition players			0

ouch : @entity5 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity64			0

@entity4 appeared to bite @entity5 during @entity8 's 1 - 0 win over @entity7
the club 's *official* website make no mention of the incident

he was *banned* for eight games in 2013 for biting @entity60
in 2010 while playing for @entity77 also bit @entity57 's @entity56
