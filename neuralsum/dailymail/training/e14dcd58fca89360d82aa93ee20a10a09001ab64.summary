nature is believed to kill off around one in every ten million animals each year			1
at this rate , for every 10,000 species of mammal on the planet , an entire species will have become extinct in the last millennium			2
but now that humans are on the scene , species are dying off as much as 1,000 times faster than they did 60 million years ago , according to a new @entity13 study			1
nature is believed to kill off around one in every ten million animals each year			1
pictured is a @entity18 orangutan twenty - four year old female , named @entity19 , playing with her female baby , named @entity21			0
the @entity18 oranguatan are critically endangered the study at @entity24 analysed genetic variation in the family trees of a number of plant and animal species to look at how they spread over time			1
it also looked at fossil records			0
previous estimates looked only at fossils , which the authors said made previous estimates on extinction rates inaccurate as it did n't consider the exact species			1
scientists calculated a ' normal background rate ' of extinction of 0.1 extinctions per million species per year			1
past estimates for the normal background rate was 10 yearly extinctions for 10 million species			1
the new study found the pre-human extinction rate was 10 times lower than scientists had believed , which means that the current level is 10 times worse			1

@entity63 means more species future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher than nature 's rates of extinction			1

the species is on the endangered list ' this reinforces the urgency to conserve what is left and to try to reduce our impacts			0
it was very , very different before humans entered the scene , ' said @entity82 , a @entity83 researcher			0
and they believe future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher than nature 's rates of extinction			1
' it 's rather like your bank account on the day you get paid , ' said mr @entity82			0
' it gets a burst of funds — akin to new species — that will quickly become extinct as you pay your bills			0
' this paper follows a recent one in @entity99 that tracks where species that are threatened or confined to small ranges around the world			2

the main cause of extinctions is thought to be human population growth in most cases , the main cause of extinctions is human population growth , although the paper also says how humans have been able to promote conservation			2
' we 've known for 20 years that current rates of species extinctions are exceptionally high , ' said @entity118 , president of the conservation nonprofit organisation @entity119			1
' this new study comes up with a better estimate of the normal background rate — how fast species would go extinct were it not for human actions			2
' it 's lower than we thought , meaning that the current extinction crisis is much worse by comparison			2
' five times , a vast majority of the world 's life has been snuffed out in what have been called mass extinctions , often associated with giant meteor strikes			2
end - @entity136 mass extinction the first of the traditional big five extinction events , around 440 million years ago , was probably the second most severe			2
virtually all life was in the sea at the time and around 85 per cent of these species vanished			0
late @entity144 mass extinction about 375 - 359 million years ago , major environmental changes caused a drawn - out extinction event that wiped out major fish groups and stopped new coral reefs forming for 100 million years			0
end - permian mass extinction ( the @entity150 ) the largest extinction event and the one that affected the @entity154 ’s ecology most profoundly took place 252 million years ago			1
as much as 97 % of species that leave a fossil record disappeared forever			0
end - @entity159 mass extinction dinosaurs first appeared in the @entity161 , but large amphibians and mammal - like reptiles were the dominant land animals			0
the rapid mass extinction that occurred 201 million years ago changed that			0
end - @entity168 mass extinction an asteroid slammed down on @entity154 66 million years ago , and is often blamed for ending the reign of the dinosaurs .			1

nature is thought to kill off one in every ten million animals each year
past estimates put it at 10 yearly extinctions for 10 million species
since mankind arrived on @entity154 , more than 1,000 out of every 10 million species have been dying out each year , a recent study discovered
study looked at fossils and genetic variation in a species ' family tree
it claims future extinction rates are likely to be 10,000 times higher
