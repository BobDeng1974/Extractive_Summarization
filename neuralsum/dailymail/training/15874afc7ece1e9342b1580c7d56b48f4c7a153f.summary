by @entity0 , editor of @entity1 published : 11:34 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 11:51 est , 5 october 2012 after weeks of planning , i finally looked at the black and white photos laying on my desk			1
we 'd set ourselves the challenge of getting @entity8 and her husband @entity9 to recreate an iconic @entity12 cover , featuring a topless @entity13 , in aid of the charity @entity15 ! for @entity16			1
suggesting that @entity8 went topless was a big ask , and was dependent on her belief in the importance of the cause we were supporting			2
@entity22 was the moment of truth			2
@entity8 and her husband @entity9 in the october issue of @entity1 , recreating the iconic @entity12 cover , in aid of breast cancer charity @entity15 ! my immediate reaction was a huge sense of relief : these pictures were every bit as powerful as i 'd hoped			1
the first signs of breast cancer are often spotted by women 's partners , which is why we involved @entity8 's husband in the shoot			1
we wanted the images to become a talking point that would make men and women look twice , think about the message , remember it - and ultimately save lives			1
when i read @entity49 's article in the @entity50 last week saying the pictures were ' shockingly crass ' and ' insensitive ' , of course i did some soul searching			2
she lost her mother to breast cancer and both her sisters have had the disease			1
the last thing i want is for anyone to find the images upsetting			1
the october issue of @entity1 but when i look at the response we have had from readers , and the hundreds of comments that have appeared on @entity66 , i feel very strongly that we did the right thing in publishing them			1
it has made the whole topic of checking your breasts a major talking point - which was our aim			2
my inspiration in this whole campaign has been an extraordinary young woman called @entity77 , who started the breast cancer charity @entity15 ! @entity77 has a very personal reason for her obsession with breasts			1
three years ago , aged just 23 , she was diagnosed with breast cancer herself			1
as she says : ' i imagined that aged 23 i would see a bit of the world , enjoy crazy nights out with my friends and have a ton of carefree fun			2
instead , i got breast cancer			1
' discovering a lump in 2008 , i went straight to my gp but was sent away on the basis that at my young age it was bound to be hormonal			2
' six months later the lump was still there			2
my no - nonsense mother marched me right back to the @entity90 and demanded a referral			0
we thought there would be nothing to worry about because breast cancer is an older women 's disease			1
' eight months on , following a frustrating fight to discover what was happening , i found out that not only did i have breast cancer , but that it had spread to my spine			1
i was at stage four , the most advanced type of cancer			2
there is no stage five			0
' @entity77 had radiotherapy followed by five months of chemotherapy and yet more radiotherapy , during which she lost her hair , had a mastectomy and said goodbye to her carefree life			0
to say she became a woman with purpose is a total understatement			2
@entity77 has since made it her full - time mission to encourage young women ( and men – they get it too ) to keep hold of their youth and freedom by simply getting to know their breasts			0
founder of @entity15 ! @entity77 , left , and @entity49 with her sister @entity130 , right so @entity15 ! was born , thanks to @entity77 and her twin sister @entity132 - who was checked but thankfully found not to have any known breast cancer genes			1
it 's a cheeky name that gets right to the point and sums up both sisters ' irreverent attitude , lust for life and love of a good pun			0
the key message from both of them is : if you do n't check your breasts you do n't know if you have the symptoms of breast cancer			1
@entity77 has taken her campaign to universities , schools and festivals			0
she relentlessly coaxes celebrities to add their support to her cause because she knows the power they have in getting the message across			0
look for swelling in your armpit or around the collarbone feel for constant pain in your breast or your armpit look for nipple discharge feel for lumps and thickening look for changes in skin texture , eg , puckering or dimpling look for change in size and shape look for nipple inversion and changes in direction look for a rash or crusting of the nipple or surrounding area do all these regularly			2
if you spot any changes , go straight to your gp			0
she has persuaded @entity184 to run marathons , @entity183 signed up to be the patron of the charity , and @entity189 actor @entity188 has given up time to support @entity15 ! too			1
shooting celebrities in an homage to the @entity12 cover was her own idea			0
originally , we discussed doing the shoot with survivors of breast cancer but decided early on that celebrities would command far more attention			1
the point of the campaign was for young women to take preventative action – immediately			0
we wanted the photograph of @entity8 to be eye - catching and glamorous , and knew it might be a little controversial			0
but it was never intended to be disrespectful to women battling breast cancer , or to those who have lost loved ones to the disease			1
speaking to @entity77 about the recent controversy , she believes we must celebrate healthy breasts – and does n't think showing photographs of them on glamorous celebrities is a bad thing			0
' getting your partner to help is n't only fun but potentially life - saving			0
sexy or not sexy , this awareness and education can prompt another young woman to start checking her breasts			2
' telling young women about the dark days of chemotherapy is not going to persuade my generation to check their breasts			0
if anything , it will scare them into doing nothing - and the fear of this disease must be stamped out or many young women will be diagnosed too late , as i was			0
' @entity236 actress @entity235 also took part in the @entity1 feature in support of @entity16 for years at @entity1 we have persuaded famous men from @entity242 , @entity243 from @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , boxer @entity248 , @entity249 stars @entity250 and @entity252 , cricketer @entity253 and many olympians to strip naked in the battle against testicular cancer			1
it is the most common cancer in young men but as they are notoriously bad at going to see the doctor about any health matters we target the women in their lives too			2
we tell them the symptoms and encourage them both to be aware of them			0
the @entity1 naked centerfold has made a taboo subject talked - about and from letters we have had i know it has saved lives			1
no one has complained that we have used healthy tennis players , footballers , cricketers , @entity277 's and soap stars to make this point and no one has had a problem with the fact that many of them have been shot in a sexy or tongue - in - cheek way			0
there is a brilliant breast awareness campaign being run in @entity288 starring the comedian @entity289 , 54 , whose mother died from breast cancer			1
it shows her holding up a series of placards featuring the lumps , dimpling and changes in skin texture of diseased breasts			0
it is powerful and shocking			0
and i am sure will get the message through to women in their 40s and beyond			0
the iconic september 1993 cover of @entity12 magazine , featuring a topless @entity13 , which inspired the @entity1 shoot but i truly believe the photos of @entity8 , who had a breast cancer scare herself when she was younger , will have far more resonance with women in their 20s and 30s			1
as the biggest magazine for young women in the world , @entity1 does a lot of research into what grabs their attention – and they are a generation of young women who respond to strong visual messages			1
they do n't want to be patronised , but a celebrity will always catch their eye			0
and they are at risk from this hideous disease			0
@entity289 says , as do the supporters of our photos on @entity66 and @entity1 readers who have written into the magazine : ' as far as i am concerned if this saves one life it is absolutely worth it			1
' i feel exactly the same way about our photographs , i thank @entity8 for having the courage to take part but most of all i thank @entity77 for being the brains behind this campaign and allowing us to bring it to life			0
but i 'll leave the last word with a @entity50 reader , @entity351 from @entity352 , following thursday 's moving piece from @entity49			0
she said : ' the campaign is n't aimed at her age group ; it is aimed at mine , the 18 - 30s			0
i had my first cancer scare at 15 and have had to check myself regularly ever since			2
' when i had my most recent scare my best friend came to me and asked how to check herself , she had no idea what to do or even that she ought to ! ' my attitude is anything that gets people to think about preventative measures is a major positive			0
fear is an incredible motivator			0
and i say this as the proud daughter of a breast cancer survivor			1
