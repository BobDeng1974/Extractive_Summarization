but the science behind the unusual rocks is much stranger			0
the @entity11 , measuring up to three metres in diameter , were in fact formed from ancient sea sediments around 60 million years ago			1
it is thought the stones were created by the cementation of @entity19 mudstone and were then buried in the mudstone cliffs found on @entity6 's @entity23 coast in isolation as well as clusters , the formations have been exposed through shoreline erosion from the coastal cliffs that frame the beach			1
experts say the unusual rocks are the result of erosion , time and concretion - when a compact mass of sedimentary rock is formed by the precipitation of natural mineral cement within the spaces between sediment grains			2
it is thought the boulders date from the @entity19 epoch making them at least 56 million years old			1
the @entity1 explained the presence of giant spherical boulders ( pictured ) on @entity4 on the @entity5 of @entity6 as eel baskets that littered the shore after the sinking of a legendary canoe found on @entity6 's @entity23 coast in isolation as well as clusters , the stones are concretions that have been exposed through shoreline erosion from the coastal cliffs ( pictured ) that frame the beach the @entity11 ( some of which are pictured ) date from the @entity19 epoch making them at least 56 million years old it is thought the stones were created by the hardening of @entity19 mudstone which was then buried in the mudstone cliffs , according to @entity61			1
the relentless pounding of waves over millennia has gradually eroded the softer stone and uncovered the compacted spherical stones			0
as the boulders were formed by concretion , they are more resistant to the weathering effects of the elements and so their shape is preserved while the softer mudstone is eroded			2
the relentless pounding of waves over the millennia has gradually eroded the softer mudstone and uncovered the compacted spherical boulders , ( pictured ) which are now a tourist attraction the spherical boulders began forming in marine mud ( that later became mudstone ) of the @entity19 sea floor , while the cracks , known as septaria formed slightly later the spherical boulders began forming in marine mud ( that later became mudstone ) of the @entity19 sea floor			1
this theory was proven when studies of the boulders ' composition showed their magnesium and iron content as well as stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon			2
scientists believe they are spherical as their source of carbon was mass diffusion and rocks two metre in diametre ' grew ' over a five million year period , when up to 50 metres of marine mud settled on top of them			0
some of the boulders measure three metres in diameter			0
rocks measuring two metres in diametre ' grew ' over a five million year period , when up to 50 metres of marine mud settled on top of them some of the rocks have strange cracks ( pictured ) , which are known as septaria			0
the cracks were filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite , which gives the boulders their distinctive appearance some of the rocks have strange cracks , which are known as septaria			0
the cracks were filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite , which gives the boulders their distinctive appearance			0
this happened when the sea level fell and allowed groundwater to flow through the mudstone surrounding the boulders			2
unusually for rocks , the centre of the concretion can be relatively weak , whereas the outer layers are the hardest part as they are composed of up to 20 per cent calcite			0
unusually for rocks , the centre of the concretion can be relatively weak , ( as can be seen by the remnants of this boulder ) whereas the outer layers are the hardest part as they are composed of up to 20 per cent calcite @entity4 on the @entity5 of @entity6 is strewn with the remnants of many giant boulders ( pictured ) uncovered from the mudstone cliffs			1

@entity1 explained giant boulders on @entity6 's @entity4 as eel baskets *scattered* after the sinking of a legendary canoe
but in fact the @entity11 are concretions - formations created by hardening sea sediment - that have been exposed through sea erosion
