the @entity1 should stop attempting to bring criminal prosecutions against hunts , an independent inquiry found yesterday			1
the charity should also rethink its longstanding role of taking animal cruelty cases to court , and help develop a new system in which it would work with government agencies to bring offenders to book			0
the inquiry led by former @entity14 chief inspector @entity13 followed criticism of the @entity1 over its successful prosecution of the @entity17 for breaking hunting law by using hounds to chase foxes in 2012			1
above , huntsmen from the hunt in 2012 the charity was accused of a political vendetta against the hunt – which once numbered @entity32 among its riders – and the magistrate in charge of the case called the £ 327,000 prosecution costs run up by the @entity1 ‘ staggering ’			1
fines and costs levied against the hunt came to less than £ 30,000			2
mr @entity13 said the charity had over its 190 - year history come to act as a private police force pursuing those suspected of animal cruelty			1
‘ the current role of the @entity1 has evolved largely outside the mainstream criminal justice system and owes more to history than any strategy , ’ he said			0
‘ the unstructured and haphazard environment within which the @entity1 operates now means that the @entity1 role is poorly defined and its relationships with the public bodies with whom its work overlaps are unclear			0
’ he added that the charity has substantial public support but ‘ there are significant weaknesses			0
in particular , its prosecution role has failed to develop to accord with contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability			0
it therefore needs to adapt			0
’ the report recommended that prosecutions under hunting law should be the province of the police and the @entity14 , and the charity should act only as a last resort if state organisations fail to act			1
cruelty prosecutions should be pared back to avoid clashing with the @entity1 ’s campaigning objectives			2
on the @entity74 prosecution , the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting			1
‘ the evidence reviewed leaves no room for doubt that , despite the 2004 legislation , traditional fox hunting remains “ business as usual ” in many parts of the country			0
' extensive flouting of the law risks bringing @entity88 , the police and prosecuting authorities into disrepute			2
widely publicised criticism of the @entity1 over the costs of the @entity17 case undoubtedly caused it reputational damage even though the prosecution itself was fully justified , ’ it found			1
the report , which runs to 140 pages and contains a string of recommendations for re-organisation the the charity ’s prosecution arm , said the @entity1 must develop an open system of co-operation with state investigators and prosecutors			1
‘ without such change , the @entity109 will be vulnerable to those with a very narrow agenda that is not founded on legitimate concern , ’ he said			0
@entity1 chairman @entity114 said : ‘ the @entity1 recognises that the world has dramatically changed during the 190 years that we have been investigating animal welfare complaints and helping to enforce the country ’s animal welfare laws			0
ruling : on the @entity74 prosecution , the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting			1
above , @entity125 and hounds , pictured in 2008 ‘ we accept the need to re-position the @entity1 ’s long - standing enforcement role and will now consider these recommendations in detail			2
we are determined to ensure that we operate an enforcement process fit for the 21st century			0
the public and the animals deserve no less			0
’ he added : ‘ hunting prosecutions are a tiny part of the @entity1 ’s enforcement work but this review provides an ideal opportunity to look at the way we handle such cases and to make any necessary adjustments			2
' significantly , the review found that the @entity1 ’s prosecution of the @entity17 had been appropriately brought and was not politically motivated			1
we accept the criticism that the costs of that case were much too high and have implemented lessons learned in subsequent cases			2

@entity152 followed criticism of the @entity1 over prosecution of @entity17
@entity156 broke hunting law by using hounds to chase foxes in 2012
the charity ran up £ 327,000 in legal costs prosecuting the case
leader of inquiry said @entity1 had come to act as a private police force
report recommended prosecutions under hunting law should be province of police and @entity14
