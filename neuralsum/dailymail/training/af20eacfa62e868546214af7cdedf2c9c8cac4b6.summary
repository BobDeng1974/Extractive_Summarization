by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 30 may 2013 @entity2 , council for the inquiry arrives at the @entity4 failures and flaws in the way barristers handle complaints against themselves are leaving the public at risk , an investigation has found			2
a scathing inquiry from a state watchdog said that the @entity15 – which regulates the elite of the legal profession – has failed to reach satisfactory standards in every area in which it operates			1
it said the findings raise a question mark over the legitimacy and legality of the complaints system			0
the strongly worded verdict from the @entity28 is a blow to the legal profession at a time when lawyers are trying to demonstrate the bodies through which they regulate themselves are working			1
criticisms levelled at the @entity15 , which is run by barristers , include delays that see hundreds of complaints against lawyers unresolved for years – with some still unfinished after almost a decade			1
two in three of those who complain to the @entity15 think they are treated unfairly , the investigation found			1
the charges come at a time of political controversy for the @entity15			1
following the publication of the @entity48 report , which calls for an end to self - regulation of newspapers and the imposition of press regulation laws , it emerged that two of the barristers who worked on opposing sides during the @entity57 were having an affair			0
@entity59 , who represented celebrities and others calling for state regulation of the press , and @entity2 , who represented the @entity57 , went for a break together to the @entity66 island of @entity67 four months before the @entity57 ended			0
the pair have said they went on holiday to discuss the possibility of a future relationship , decided against it , but changed their minds later on			0
and @entity48 rejected any suggestion that the @entity57 may have been compromised , and has said it is for the @entity15 to settle a complaint from senior @entity80 mp @entity79 over the conduct of the lawyers			1
the @entity15 , which was launched seven years ago , has come in for repeated criticism			1
nevertheless , last year its chairman @entity84 insisted it was in ‘ rude health ’			0
but the report from the @entity28 said one survey had found more than two thirds of people who complained to the @entity15 about the conduct of barristers thought its methods were neither open nor fair			1
the @entity15 , which polices the conduct of 15,000 barristers , ‘ has very little evidence ’ about the views of ordinary people who pay them , it found			1
however , user satisfaction surveys showed ‘ a significant number of those that have had reason to complain about an individual regulated by the @entity15 do not consider the process open and fair ’			1
the figure was 67 per cent , or two out of three complainants			0
during 2013 , the @entity28 said , the @entity15 has been handling 316 complaints about barristers which date back to 2010 and 2011			2
there were a number of even older unresolved cases , with one going back to 2004			0
@entity48 rejected any suggestion that the @entity57 may have been compromised ‘ such delays are not fair to those regulated by the @entity15 who face such allegations for such a long period and raise risks to consumers who receive services from barristers who may be unfit to practise or need to undertake remedial action , ’ the report said			2
the inquiry questioned the independence of the @entity15 because its purse strings are held by the @entity128 , the organisation which speaks for barristers			1
the @entity128 can reject any item of @entity15 spending , must approve any cheques for more than £ 1,000 , and can veto staff appointments			2
the report said in some incidents the watchdog had ‘ been concerned about the @entity128 ’s attempts to fetter this independence ’			0
it added : ‘ involvement of the representative body in regulatory matters raises risks to the legitimacy of the independent regulatory body ’			0
it might also break the law , the report said			0
the inquiry also criticised the way the regulator operates through eight different committees with 130 members , adding the @entity28 ‘ does not believe that it can deliver effective or efficient governance ’			0
the @entity15 currently claims that by the end of 2013 ‘ the term @entity15 - regulated will be an assurance of good , honest , independent advocacy and expert legal advice ’			1
however , the @entity28 said the @entity15 had in reality promised only to achieve satisfactory grades in all areas by the spring of 2016 and that even this task was ‘ ambitious ’			1
it said some improvements would need ‘ culture change ’ and in other areas the @entity15 ‘ has painted an overly optimistic picture about the progress it has made ’			2
@entity15 director dr @entity167 said : ‘ the report praises the @entity15 ’s self - assessment and progress in this area while identifying areas for improvement			2
she added : ‘ like any organisation that serves the public – and this one does so at no expense to the public – we want to improve constantly			0
‘ we welcome the fact that the @entity28 agrees with how we have analysed our progress so far and how we are going to continue to modernise			0
' we know that is ambitious and tough : but we also know that the public deserves no less			0

an inquiry has said the @entity15 has failed to reach satisfactory standards
the strongly worded verdict is a blow to the legal profession
