the court heard that on the day of @entity12 ’s death , @entity1 and miss @entity24 had become ' agitated ' because they had run out of drugs			1
@entity31 , mitigating , said : ' there is plenty of evidence that he and @entity24 are likely to have been in a state of agitation due to lack of cannabis			2
' the pair had subsequently argued , before miss @entity24 left @entity12 in @entity1 's care while she went to the doctors			1
during her absence , @entity12 was admitted to @entity43 with serious head injuries - with one shocked expert saying he had never before seen such a severe case of bleeding in the eyes			1
the baby died three days later when her life support machine was switched off			0
an examination on @entity12 's body found she had either been shaken or suffered a head injury from hitting her head against a soft surface - or a combination of both			1
victim : @entity58 was shaken to death by her father at her home in @entity20 , @entity15 @entity1 , who has an iq of 52 and can not read , initially told police he had not touched his daughter all day - claiming she had simply gone ' all floppy ' while he was feeding her			1

@entity66 , prosecuting , said @entity1 had a string of previous convictions for violence between 2006 and 2010 , including punching a pregnant woman and assaulting a police officer			2
he had been handed community orders , cautions , reprimands and warnings for the offences			0
however , @entity77 said @entity1 's ' modest ' upbringing in a ' drug - ridden ' neighbourhood meant it was ' hardly surprising ' he had acquired previous convictions and a drug habit			1
case : @entity1 , who has an iq of 52 , was jailed for six years at @entity23 yesterday he added that the defendant had been subjected to attacks in custody - including scalding water being thrown at his face - due to the nature of his offence in january this year			1

a serious case review is now being carried out into the way public bodies handled the case			0
@entity103 , mr @entity104 told him : ' this is a case where a loss of control has resulted in a fatal act of violence on a defenceless baby			0
' you will have to live with the fact that you killed your daughter			2
' he added that @entity1 's ' serious learning disabilities ' could have been a factor in @entity12 's death			1
' you admitted having a short temper , ' he told him			0
' your inability to control your temper is exacerbated by your significant learning disability			0
' she had been left with you in her crib and she must have in some way irritated you that you lost your temper with her			0
' you yourself said she was crying - it may well have been that			2
' speaking after the case , @entity128 , crown advocate for the @entity129 , described the case as ' difficult '			0
' some people may consider that six years for killing a child is inappropriate , but i want the community to understand that the defendant was charged with manslaughter , ' he said			0
case : speaking outside @entity23 , pictured , today , the @entity140 advocate described the case as ' difficult ' ' he did n’t intend to kill the baby , nor did he intend to cause it really serious harm			2
' also , the defendant does have serious learning difficulties			0
his iq is between 52 and 54			0
he lost control when he had that baby , probably because it cried			0
' as a result of that , he shook it and that baby died			0
