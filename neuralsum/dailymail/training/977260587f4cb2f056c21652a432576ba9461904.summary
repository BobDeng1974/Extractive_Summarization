warning graphic content the little cat squared up to a lioness and pulled back its ears and bore its teeth - proving that it would not go down without a fight the lioness was 30 times the size of the wildcat but it refused to go without a fight two more lionesses began to circle around the cat yet it still fought on the animals ' huge paws descended onto the little cat as it gripped onto the dirt track the wildcat became stuck between the huge animals as it looked up defiantly at the predator it bore its teeth while the lionesses growled from above the cat rose its paw and swiped the lioness across the face proving its determination to put up a fight the tiny animal soon became fenced in by the huge predators in the @entity31 nature park giving up : the little wildcat becomes weak after being attacked and mauled by the predators but still looks up in defiance one lioness bites the small animal despite the long battle for its life the lioness carries the motionless animal 's small body away in its mouth			1
