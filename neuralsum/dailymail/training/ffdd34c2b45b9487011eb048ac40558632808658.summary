the @entity1 movies this year may be small , but they 're packing a lot of drama			1
when the 87th @entity1 kick off on sunday night at 8:30 est , the @entity4 in @entity5 will be buzzing with something the @entity1 have n't always had in recent years : genuine intrigue at who the night 's biggest winners will be			1
the @entity1 may also have another sight unusual to @entity11 : rain			2
light afternoon showers are expected , which could dampen red - carpet arrivals - though the carpet itself is under a glass tent			1
it topped the acting , directing and producing guild awards , which are often strong predictors of what the @entity40 will vote for			0
@entity30 also won best feature at saturday 's @entity43 , further boosting its momentum			0
at the @entity48 beachside bash , star @entity45 , who won best actor , proclaimed the film ' bold cinema ' and ' a game changer , ' a judgment shared by many in @entity22 who no doubt recognize something in @entity45 's character 's out - of - control ego			0
but the coronation of @entity30 is far from assured			0
many believe the landmark of @entity59 12 - years - in - the - making @entity60 will ultimately prove irresistible to academy members			1
best director also appears to be a toss - up between @entity31 and @entity59			1
three of the acting winners — @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and @entity67 ( @entity60 ) — are virtual locks going into sunday 's show , but best actor will be a nail biter			1
television reporters stand next to an @entity1 statue outside the @entity4 during preparations leading up to the 87th @entity1 on sunday it could be the young @entity78 star @entity79 for his technically nuanced performance as @entity81 in @entity82 , or it could be @entity45 's career - topper in @entity30 , as an actor trying to flee his superhero past			1
but whether suspense will be enough to pull viewers to the telecast on @entity89 remains to be seen			0
host @entity27 will hope to continue the recent ratings upswing for the @entity1 , which last year drew 43 million viewers , making it the most - watched entertainment telecast in a decade			1
this year 's crop of nominees , however , is notably light on box - office smashes			2
@entity97 's @entity96 ( six nominations including best picture ) is the only best - picture candidate to gross more than $ 100 million domestically			2
( a runaway hit , it recently surpassed $ 300 million			0
) possibly worse for the @entity1 is that the lack of diversity in the nominees this year ( all 20 nominated actors are white ) turned off many potential viewers and led some to call for a boycott of the broadcast			2
producers @entity110 and @entity112 are likely to aim for a telecast more inclusive than the nominees			0
when the 87th @entity1 kick off on sunday night at 8:30 est , the @entity4 in @entity5 will be buzzing with something the @entity1 have n't always had in recent years : genuine intrigue at who the night 's biggest winners will be planned performers include @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , as well as @entity1 - nominated original songs : @entity124 and @entity125 ( glory from @entity127 ) , @entity128 ( @entity129 from @entity130 ) , @entity131 ( i 'm not gon na @entity133 from @entity134			1
i 'll be me ) , @entity135 ( @entity136 from beyond the @entity137 ) and @entity138 with the @entity139 ( @entity140 from @entity141 )			0
@entity142 ( a co-star in @entity127 ) will be among the presenters , as will @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
increasingly , ratings are driven by moments that spark social media frenzy , like when @entity152 famously mispronounced the name of singer @entity157 as @entity157 at last year 's show			0
sunday night , he gets a chance for redemption			2
nominees for this year 's @entity1 : sunday 's diversity protest is planned for barely three hours before curtain up on the 2015 ceremony			1

the 87th @entity1 kick off on sunday night at 8:30 est , the @entity4 in @entity5
afternoon showers are expected , which could dampen red - carpet arrivals and so this year the carpet is under a glass tent
with nine nominations , @entity31 's backstage comedy birdman is predicted by some to be the night 's big winner
@entity59 's 12 - years - in - the - making @entity60 is considered its main competition for the @entity180 generated
