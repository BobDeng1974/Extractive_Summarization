he also raised the astonishing prospect that @entity11 stars such as @entity20 and @entity21 could be stuck on the team bus for up to four hours in gridlocked traffic as they travel nine miles to and from their training base			1
while officially the @entity1 say they are ‘ fully confident ’ in security arrangements , former policeman mr @entity0 ’s comments , overheard by a @entity28 reporter in the bar of the @entity11 hotel in @entity5 , raise questions about preparations			1

i get calls from management , from my bosses at the @entity1 , freaking out saying , “ @entity51 , are you sure it ’s safe ? ” ‘ they ask me , “ is this really going to be safe for the team ? ” they are worried			1
‘ we have to be extra vigilant			0
we can not afford to make any mistakes			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s comments – coming just a month before the tournament kicks off – raise serious question marks over the @entity1 ’s decision to base themselves in central @entity5			2
@entity11 ’s hotel , the ageing @entity65 , is rated by travel website @entity66 as only the 93rd best in the city			1
only one other team – @entity70 , who will train much closer to their hotel – are based in the city , while @entity74 have built their own private beach resort to stay in			2
@entity11 's hotel is located within view of the @entity6 in @entity5 where armed gangs are being targeted by police mr @entity0 told his colleague that a nine - mile trip between the squad ’s training base in a military camp at @entity86 in @entity87 in the shadow of @entity89 and the hotel had taken him two hours			1
he said : ‘ the traffic is awful			0
even with a police escort it will be a nightmare			2
the traffic is my biggest worry			0
this is a logistical nightmare			0
we have to work on how we get the team from a to b without getting held up			0
‘ we will be stuck in traffic the whole time			0
’ the airport , where the @entity11 players and their retinue , totalling no fewer than 78 people , will have to travel to to get to their group games , is even further away			1

he told the @entity36 : ‘ your guys need to know they can challenge anyone to see their badges			2
they must check and re-check everyone			0
’ and on hotel security , he said : ‘ we ca n’t afford to let anyone in because once you are through that door out there you can go straight to the lift and get straight up to the players ’ rooms in no time			2
’ as more than 50,000 @entity11 fans prepare to descend on @entity36 , it is hard to imagine they have much idea of what actually awaits them : heavily armed snipers have been tasked to patrol the @entity6 , near where the @entity11 team will be based for the @entity127 @entity36 authorities are having difficulties clamping down violence in advance of the @entity127 the host cities for @entity11 ’s first games – @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 – are plagued by robberies , murders and muggings			1
@entity135 has its own slum problem and , in @entity134 , a steaming jungle city a four - hour flight north of @entity5 , child ‘ gangs ’ roam the streets robbing visitors at knifepoint			0
the violence shows no sign of abating			0
one person was shot dead on friday as @entity5 police clashed with armed men in a favela close to the @entity11 hotel			1

he has our full support			0
’ @entity176 mp @entity175 , who is a qualified referee and member of the @entity178 , said last night : ‘ like every @entity180 fan , i want our team and its management to be as safe as possible and would expect these concerns to have been addressed by now			2
