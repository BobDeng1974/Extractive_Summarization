by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 we are down to the final two and this most enthralling of @entity5 will climax with either @entity6 or @entity7 crowned champion			1
they are both worthy victors , @entity6 having coupled fortitude with flair on their march to the final while @entity7 have proved resilient and resourceful during their passage			1
the world ’s number one @entity33 has proved his standing as thus at the finals and – like @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 – is deserving of a @entity43 winner ’s medal			0
not getting past : @entity27 has been one of the outstanding goalkeepers of the competition @entity46 to his credit , @entity46 has ignored – and subsequently silenced - the naysayers who deemed him the weak link after a season of inactivity at @entity52			2
he was the star in the penalty - shootout victory over @entity54 and will have to produce similar heroics if @entity7 are to triumph			1
verdict : @entity27 is the best there is when it comes to the goalkeeping trade and @entity46 , despite impressing , does n’t come close to the @entity59			0
between the sticks : @entity46 's penalty heroics helped @entity7 through to the final @entity63 @entity64 even from full - back he is able to influence affairs with his intelligence and ability to keep the ball and is rarely shown up on a defensive front either			1
switching up : @entity64 was moved from midfield back to full - back by manager @entity73 @entity74 combative and energetic , @entity74 is very much the modern full - back with a healthy dose of old - school cynicism thrown in			2
he is dependable and a leader			0
verdict : perhaps the toughest call on the park but @entity74 shades it on his energy and aggression			0
trusted : @entity83 defender @entity74 has had a fantastic tournament at right - back for @entity7 @entity63 @entity86 he ’s on the shortlist for @entity90 ’s @entity89 prize and that serves to highlight his assured and classy presence at the heart of the @entity59 backline			1
scored the winner in the quarter - final defeat of @entity97			2
@entity98 : @entity86 scored the only goal against @entity97 in the quarters and was in fine form against @entity32 @entity102 the @entity104 stopper marries grit and grizzle to his ability to play and few forwards at these finals have enjoyed coming up against him			1
verdict : another one which could go either way but @entity86 is one cool customer and boasts latter - stage @entity114 experience with @entity116			2
other end : @entity102 scores a penalty for @entity7 in the semi-final win over @entity54 @entity120 - back @entity121 he has grown into the tournament and , given his ease in possession , fits well into the @entity59 model			1
versatile : @entity121 fends off a challenge from @entity127 in the quarter - final victory @entity129 @entity7 have looked better for his presence and , although a gaffe is never too far away , the veteran has been solid and reliable			2
verdict : @entity83 past and present , but its former defender @entity121 who gets the nod given his athleticism and ability to recover a situation			0
for once @entity129 makes a mistake it is invariably punished			0
sliding in : @entity83 defender @entity129 did a good job marshaling @entity141 on wednesday evening @entity63 @entity142 he is seldom exposed despite being more accustomed to a central role and is used to being charged with shackling the likes of @entity24 and @entity145			0
dependable : @entity142 has been solid throughout @entity6 's @entity43 campaign @entity148 there were doubts about the @entity152 defender given his preference for a more central posting but he has excelled at left - back			1
verdict : both players would prefer to be playing at centre - back but have adapted admirably to their duty in @entity32 but it is the experience and know - how of @entity142 which wins him the nod			2
passion : @entity7 's @entity148 celebrates after the shootout win over the @entity165 defensive midfielder @entity167 he keeps it simple but keeps the ball with it and is the heartbeat of this side			2
he has the personality for the biggest stage and will be desperate to add a @entity43 to his enviable haul of trophies			2
experience : @entity167 is playing in his sixth major tournament with @entity6 @entity179 note to @entity180 : play him in midfield and @entity179 is the best in the business			0
he breaks play , builds play and whips others into shape with the standard he sets			0
his tackle to deny @entity141 at the death in the semi-final captured everything about his contribution ; courageous , athletic and game - changing			2
verdict : the @entity7 man is an all - action hero whose side could not function without his influence , and for that he is deserving of his place ahead of @entity167			1
[ caption defensive midfielder @entity202 he turned in one of the performances of the finals against @entity32 , combining graft and craft and chipping in with a goal			2
he gallops around the park but brings a classy , calming influence to the team at the same time			0
class act : @entity202 controlled the game in @entity214 as @entity6 beat @entity32 7 - 1 @entity215 the @entity217 man is understated but do n’t underestimate his ability and he compliments well the snarl of @entity179 in the middle of the pitch			1
verdict : @entity202 is a class act and brings the recent – and invaluable - experience of his @entity114 victory with @entity225 to the party			0
chance : @entity217 midfielder @entity215 has only started two of @entity7 's six @entity43 games this tournament attacking midfielder @entity232 much has been made of the scramble for his signature and now we know why			1
be it five yards or fifty , left boot or right , @entity232 locates his team - mates with unerring accuracy and – as his double against @entity32 proved – he can be clinical in front of goal			1
on his watch : @entity232 is one @entity59 midfielder who can control the pace of the game in @entity248 @entity249 he did well against @entity54 and is bright and energetic			1
he is , however , no match for the injured @entity251			0
verdict : ‘ @entity252 ’ is the ultimate midfield player and will again seek to dictate affairs in the final			0
@entity256 : @entity249 races away from @entity258 and @entity259 during the semi-final in @entity261 attacking midfielder @entity263 he ca n’t tackle , is n’t a great passer , does n’t really have a turn of foot and ca n’t dribble – sound familiar ? each of the above has been said of @entity263 yet he has been the player of the tournament and his unyielding hunger for goals has been rewarded on five occasions			1
on the chase : @entity263 has a chance of being named @entity276 winner for a second straight @entity43 @entity277 the @entity278 forward works hard , yes , but where are the goals and assists ? much more is needed if @entity7 are to upset the odds			1
verdict : @entity263 is a star , @entity277 is something of a myth			0
getaway : @entity278 star @entity277 escapes @entity285 during the nervy semi-final attacking midfielder @entity288 he has come in for criticism back in @entity6 and rightly so			0
he is the lazy link in this fantastic @entity59 side and has been a passenger during their journey to the final			0
roar : @entity288 has the chance to answer his critics after a quiet @entity43 for @entity6 @entity24 is he saving one last explosion of magic for the final ? we hope so			1
outstanding in the group stage but subdued in the knockout rounds , @entity24 is nonetheless the best player on the park and without him @entity7 would not stand a chance			1
verdict : even if @entity288 had impressed – which he has n’t – @entity24 would still win this one hands down			0
superstar : @entity24 finally has the chance to make himself a hero on the biggest stage of all striker @entity314 it ’s a simple science : goals win games and , to that end , @entity315 is a match - winner			1
his 16 are now a @entity43 record and , although he does little else around the pitch , who cares ? down in history : @entity314 is now the all - time leading goalscorer in @entity43 history @entity145 like @entity315 , @entity145 is a man who trades in goals			0
however , it has n’t happened for him in @entity32 and he has , in truth , been a disappointment			0
verdict : @entity145 ’s profligacy has almost cost his side but @entity315 has proved predatory in the big moments and is chosen ahead of the @entity334			0
up top : @entity336 striker @entity145 will lead @entity7 from the front against @entity6 final score : @entity6 8 - 3 @entity7 @entity7 @entity6			1

@entity73 's @entity6 meet @entity7 on *sunday* in the @entity43 final
@entity6 , with @entity232 , @entity263 , @entity27 and @entity86 , have seen some *supreme* performances over their six games
the 7 - 1 defeat of @entity32 means they are favourites ahead of the game
@entity7 beat @entity54 on penalties in the semi-final in @entity261
they are looking for their first @entity43 win in 28 years
@entity24 has the chance to be a hero on the biggest of all stages
