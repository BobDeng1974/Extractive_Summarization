by @entity0 companies could be forced to pay out billions in backdated commission , overtime and bonuses , after a @entity6 court ruled a worker could still be paid his usual commission while on holiday			1
the landmark ruling comes after @entity12 salesman mr @entity11 took his employer to an employment tribunal , claiming his commission should be paid on top of his basic salary while he was on annual leave			1
now the @entity19 has ruled in mr @entity11 's favour , saying the @entity22 - under which all @entity6 holiday pay is governed - allows for employees to keep receiving their work - related benefits while on holiday			1
the @entity19 , pictured , has ruled in favour of mr @entity11 , who took his employer @entity12 to an employment tribunal over whether he was allowed to be paid commission during his annual leave major unions have welcomed the ruling , saying it will force companies to pay ' proper salaries ' and will mean employees are not short - changed on their pay			1
but industry experts have warned the ruling could have a huge detrimental effect on businesses - potentially forcing companies across the country to shell out billions in backdated payments			1
some warn it could open the floodgates for thousands of claims relating not just to commission but to all employee benefits , such as overtime and bonuses , causing an ' unnecessary increase in uncertainty '			2
as the directive was introduced in 2008 , it is likely claims could potentially date back six years			0
@entity56 , head of employment policy at @entity58 , the manufacturers ' organisation , told @entity60 that a medium - sized company , which on average is made up of about 200 employees , could be forced to pay out £ 3.3m in backdated payments			1
although the full financial impact is not yet known , mr @entity56 said the figure is so high because the @entity19 could require @entity67 employers to include almost all elements of pay within the calculation of holiday pay			1
he said that , on average , businesses had calculated the ruling , if enforced , would add 4 per cent to their annual payroll			2
he said : ' for medium sized and large employers , this will equate to hundreds if not millions of pounds			0
' employers who have complied by @entity67 law will be dismayed at the future prospect of higher wage costs and the potential liability for back - pay , which they could never have foreseen or prepared for			2
' larger companies will inevitably look at how they will need to change the organisation of their businesses , as the court seems minded to include almost all elements of pay in the holiday pay pot – commission , bonuses and overtime			1
' smaller companies are likely to have fewer options – for some , there must be a high risk that they will go under			0
' ' employers who have complied by @entity67 law will be dismayed at the future prospect of higher wage costs and the potential liability for back - pay , which they could never have foreseen or prepared for ' @entity56 , head of employment at @entity58 mr @entity11 first took his employers to a tribunal in @entity108 in 2012 , which referred the case to the @entity6 court			1
he asked to be paid his commission between 19 december 2011 and 3 january 2012 , when he was on annual leave			1
according to court papers , mr @entity11 said he was losing 60 per cent of his salary because his commission - related earnings were not covered when he went on holiday			1
he claimed that , because he was unable to generate any new sales or follow up on potential sales while on holiday , this affected the amount he was paid once he returned to work			2
he argued that , under @entity123 law , he was entitled to be compensated for this			2
the court said mr @entity11 had lost out on his usual amount of pay during his holiday at @entity12 , which in turn could discourage employees from taking leave the employment tribunal referred the case to the @entity6 court , asking the @entity19 whether commission - earners could expect payment for potential sales they miss out on while on holiday , in addition to their base salaries			1
it also asked how this anticipated drop in payment should be calculated			0
yesterday , the court passed down a preliminary ruling in mr @entity11 ’s favour , saying any employee given less pay while on holiday than they would usually earn while working could be deterred from taking annual leave - which itself goes against @entity6 principles			1
@entity12 said it would ' await the outcome ' of the employment tribunal to see exactly what impact the ruling would have on its business			1
the ruling said : ' in today ’s judgment , the court points out that , during annual leave , a worker must receive his normal remuneration			1
' the purpose of holiday pay is to put the worker , during that period of rest , in a situation which is , as regards his salary , comparable to periods of work			0
' it continued : ' as @entity12 conceded at the hearing , the worker does not generate any commission during the period of his annual leave			1
' in the period following that of his annual leave the worker is paid only reduced remuneration comprising his basic salary			1
that adverse financial impact may deter the worker from actually taking that leave			0
' ' we will have to look at the full judgment from the @entity19 but the ramifications are massive			2
it is likely millions of workers in the @entity67 have been short changed on their holiday pay ' @entity189 , @entity190 national officer for energy dr @entity192 , executive director of policy and external affairs at the @entity195 , said the decision was bad news for businesses up and down the country			2
he said : ' this judgement will cause unnecessary increase in uncertainty for businesses up and down the @entity67 and is likely to give rise to far more disputes between employers and employees , haggling over what the appropriate level of remuneration should be whilst on holiday			0
' the existing system was well understood and highly clear for both parties			0
' mr @entity56 said it would raise the bill for companies across the board			0
he said : ' in addition to this , there will be further costs that will arise			0
' for example , there will be an increase in the national insurance contributions payable by the employer and pension contributions , and some employers will need to change their internal systems to perform the calculation			0
' we are aware of some businesses who anticipate that they will need to recruit extra staff in order to meet the administrative requirements			0
' but @entity237 general secretary @entity236 said : ' this is an extremely important decision that will assist workers across the @entity6 to argue that they should be entitled to their normal pay , including any commission payments they normally receive , for periods of annual leave			1
' and @entity189 , @entity190 national officer for energy , said : ' we will have to look at the full judgment from the @entity19 but the ramifications are massive			2
' companies who pay commission payments should be using those payments for the purposes of calculating holiday pay			2
it is likely millions of workers in the @entity67 have been short changed on their holiday pay			0
' as you would expect the @entity259 are warning that this will lead to the roof falling in but this is nonsense			0
' capital 's share of annual national income has increased by nearly 50 per cent in a generation			2
this will put a small dent in that shift and is well affordable			0
' the case will now go back to the @entity270 but it is likely millions will be due back pay and will get a big boost to holiday pay in future			0
' it is likely to force employers to start paying proper salaries too			0
there is little incentive now not to pay proper salaries			0
they are going to have to pay holiday pay on the workers earnings			0
' the case will now be referred back to the employment tribunal to determine what annual leave payments mr @entity11 is entitled to under @entity67 law			1
it will then be left open to the @entity67 government to see how the ruling is put into domestic law			0
@entity295 , director of employment law at @entity12 , said : ' many of our people receive commission as part of doing their job , so we ’re reviewing in detail the @entity19 judgment			1
' however , we ’ll need to await the outcome of the @entity67 @entity270 ’s decision to understand the precise impact of this @entity123 judgment on @entity67 legislation			0
' we ’re already examining the issue raised by the @entity11 case as part of a wider review of employee incentives and working with trade union representatives to help us design our future employee incentive schemes			2

@entity12 salesman mr @entity11 took his employer to employment tribunal
he claimed he was entitled to commission pay while on annual leave
@entity19 ruled in mr @entity11 's favour
experts fear businesses of all sizes could now be forced to pay out billions
