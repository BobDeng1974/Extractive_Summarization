by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:29 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 13:24 est , 20 december 2013 a new report has cleared the @entity4 in any institutional wrongdoing and blamed the @entity7 prostitution scandal on a few misbehaved agents			1
' although individual employees have engaged in misconduct or inappropriate behavior , we did not find evidence that misconduct is widespread , ' the inspector general 's report says			1
the other most egregious example of professional misconduct came in the form of one incident in 2010 that was described as being ' similar to @entity21			0
brushing past it : the report says that the agency does not have institutional issues but just problems with certain agents who were found to solicit prostitutes and drink with locals while prepping for presidential visits many of the identifying details of that incident have been redacted , but @entity34 does tell how the agent in question was abroad ' in support of a presidential visit ' and drank with locals before he was spotted arriving at the airport with locals that day			2
unlike the public debacle that ensued following the @entity21 incident , this 2010 occurrence did not lead to any thorough investigation and the agent in question had their proposed sanctions withdrawn			0
' individuals consumed alcohol ; interacted with ( female foreign nationals ) ; and were untruthful when initially questioned by managers , ' the report reads according to the @entity55			0
in addition to brushing past the @entity21 , @entity7 scandal that occurred in may 2012 , the 18 - month investigation also found that there were a handful of reports of agents soliciting prostitutes including one as recent as this year			1
again details were scant in the report , but the agent who ' engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money ' earlier this year had his security credentials report			1
all told , the report did not find that ' employees frequently engage in behaviors ... that could cause a security concern '			0
international incident : in may 2012 , a @entity4 agent who was in @entity7 ahead of the president 's visit to the country got into an altercation with a prostitute woman in the middle : @entity84 was identified as the prostitute involved in the @entity21 scandal ' furthermore , we did not find any evidence that [ @entity4 ] leadership has fostered an environment that tolerates inappropriate behavior			1
' that statement comes well after the agency 's response , as @entity95 was promoted to lead the @entity4 in the wake of the scandal 's blowback			2
administrators are going to have trouble defending the findings , however , as many have questioned the way in which the investigation was completed			0
even though technically the investigators heard back from 2,575 employees , their responses came through an anonymous online survey ms @entity95 , the first female head of the male - dominated industry , slammed the report , wrote that survey participants were told to ' speculate about the personal , sexual , and potential criminal activities of co-workers ' based largely on ' rumor and gossip '			1
restoring trust : even new @entity4 head @entity95 thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report ' rumors and gossip ' she attached a copy of her letter to the report , which will be released fully today , and tried to assure the public that while the findings may be flawed , the agency has made a number of efforts to right some of the apparent wrongs			1
the report cited 14 possible ways for the agency to improve , 11 of which have already been implemented			2
‘ the criticality of the @entity4 ’s mission demands that we maintain the highest levels of integrity in our workforce			0
i remain committed to investigating and adjudicating all instances of misconduct that are brought to my attention , ’ she wrote			0
the prostitution incident that occurred this year that was alluded to in the report was not the agency ’s most recent embarrassment , however , as two secret service agents on president @entity151 's detail were reprimanded in may after one was caught trying to force himself into a woman 's hotel room to collect a bullet that he had left there after meeting her hours before in the hotel bar			2
scandal prone : the latest @entity4 incident happened in may of this year when an agent ( not one of those pictured above ) tried to get a bullet that he left in a woman 's hotel room @entity164 , who works as a senior supervisor in charge of more than 20 agents , was investigated by his superiors after a hotel staffer reported his unusual behavior			1
the ensuing investigation also found that he and another agent , @entity172 , were sending sexually suggestive emails to a female subordinate			0
both men have now been suspended from the @entity4 and the incident remains under investigation .			0

inspector general is releasing an 18 - month investigation today that looked at the @entity7 prostitution scandal of may 2012
says that the agents involved behaved inappropriately but the misconduct was *limited* to those men
even new @entity4 head @entity95 thinks that the report is flawed since it is based on an anonymous survey of agents who were effectively asked to report ' rumors and gossip '
she said they have already implemented 11 of the 14 suggested *safeguards*
report also found out that a different agent ' engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money ' earlier this year
