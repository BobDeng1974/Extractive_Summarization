above , a picture of the group monday night many outlets reported that the event had been cancelled completely , because the temple could n't find an off - campus location to host the service			1
but they eventually worked out a deal with the @entity43 restaurant on @entity44 and posted on their @entity46 page that the event would take place ' within the hour ' around 10:30pm			1
change of location : the event was reportedly moved to the @entity43 restaurant in @entity44 original location : the mass was originally supposed to be held in the basement of @entity12 , but had to move with the sponsoring student group dropped out last week , the cultural studies club caused controversial when they announced plans to host a historical re-enactment of a black mass. controversial : @entity28 , a @entity61 group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven - foot tall statue of @entity65 ( pictured ) next to an existing @entity67 monument in @entity68 it said the event was intended to be educational and would be preceded by a lecture on the history and origins of the black mass , a ritual that parodies the catholic mass , in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed			1

' our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith , which would be repugnant to our educational purposes , but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices , ' the club said			0
the announcement sparked outrage across campus and even in @entity20 proper , with the @entity94 issuing a statement saying the activity ' places participants dangerously close to destructive works of evil '			0
@entity2 president @entity100 even condemned the event as ' abhorrent ' , but said the university would not cancel the service so as to protect freedom of speech			1
' vigorous and open discussion and debate are essential to the pursuit of knowledge , and we must uphold these values even in the face of controversy , ' president @entity100 said in a statement monday			2
' freedom of expression , as @entity119 [ @entity118 ] @entity117 famously said long ago , protects not only free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate , ' she added			0

demonstration : hundreds of @entity18 protested the event by holding a @entity149 procession to @entity151 monday evening for a holy hour show of solidarity : the procession culminated in a holy hour at @entity151 and was attended by president @entity100 ' it is unimaginable that @entity2 would have permitted such an obscene parody of the sacred rites of another religion , ' @entity166 , the league 's executive director , said in a statement earlier monday			1
' @entity173 , however , remains a respectable prejudice			0
' however , the student group that originally sponsored the event thinks it has been misinterpreted			0
' we are disappointed by the self - righteousness of those who conspire to silence others simply because they claim offense , ' the @entity7 said in a statement monday night			2
