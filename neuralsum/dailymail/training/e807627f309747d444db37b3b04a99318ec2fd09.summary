professor @entity0 has received a major communications system upgrade that has doubled the speed of his speech and allows him to write ten times quicker			1
the physicist said the new technology will allow him to continue to write and give lectures , as well as communicate more effectively with friends and family			2
he assured fans , though , that his trademark synthesised voice will remain the same despite the up - rated technology			1
‘ we are pushing the boundaries of what is possible through technology - without it i would not be able to speak to you today			0
‘ @entity39 ’s research and development is bringing about changes in the world and in the way that disabled people can communicate			0
‘ the @entity39 team and i have been working together for almost three years on upgrading my communication system			2
‘ my old system is more than 20 years old and i was finding difficult to continue to communicate effectively , and to do the things i love to do			1
‘ with the improvements made , i am now able to write much faster , and it means that i can continue to give lectures , write papers and books and , of course , speak with my family and friends more easily			0
this new system is life changing for me , and i hope it will serve me well for the next 20 years			1
’ professor @entity0 unveiled his new communications system , pictured , at an event in @entity63 prof @entity0 , who appeared in an episode of @entity65 , said his new technology was being made freely available so other people with life - changing disabilities will be able to benefit from the three - year project the software learns the words and phrases used by @entity73 , enabling him to type and speak quicker using the infra - red sensor on his glasses and the movement of his cheek			1
prof @entity0 suffers from a form of motor neurone disease which has left him almost paralysed			2
the new equipment is called @entity82 ( @entity81 )			0
it uses special software designed by @entity86 company @entity87 - similar to those on smartphones , which is able to select words after inputting just 10 - 15 per cent of the letters			0
this reduces the effort and time required to communicate			0
professor @entity0 said the technology he helped develop will be made freely available early next year to help other people with motor neurone disease , quadriplegia and other disabilities			1
he added : ' by making this technology freely available it has the potential to greatly improve the lives of disabled people all over the world			0

professor @entity0 has received an upgraded **computer** system
his rate of speech has doubled and his writing speed has also improved
the physicist said his old **computer** was 20 years old and was too slow
he *stressed* that he wanted to keep his trademark synthesised voice
the new technology will be made freely available in the @entity117
