to win the prize the couples had to compete by saying why they deserved the prize and try to gain the restaurant more likes on its @entity20 page			1
several of the likers of the @entity20 page vent their disgust at some of the comments made towards the contestants but the competition was axed by the @entity29 eatery after some of the brides - to - be and their families , some of which had terminally ill relatives , received abusive messages on the social network			1
it is unclear what the abusive messages said as they have now been removed from @entity20			2
one of the contestants of the competition , who did not want to be named , told @entity42 : ' the comments were n't on and i 'm glad they were removed			2
' i do n't blame the @entity6 for pulling the competition , there was no need for some of the comments			1
' these stupid people have ruined it for everybody else			0

we do not condone bullying , and nor can we be seen to promote it			0

but we could not endorse this			0
' up for grabs in the contest was a november wedding package , which included transport , venue hire , a cake , reception and entertainment			1

' but a statement posted on the restaurant 's @entity20 page , which has also since been removed , read : ' after a lot of deliberation between the management team we regret to inform you all that the wedding competition is going to have to be cancelled			1

the @entity112 restaurant in @entity7 , which had been running the wedding competition ' we have received many personal messages from people accusing us of condoning internet bullying and even threatening us with police action			1
' as a result , we feel the only option is to cancel the competition			0
' this competition was intended to be a celebration of our third anniversary			0
it was a gift to the community , for all the amazing support we have had over the past three years			0
' unfortunately , we have been shocked that this gift has had to end in this way			0
