all smiles : @entity27 's @entity2 celebrates her semi-final victory over @entity12 's @entity11 big hitter : @entity9 throws a right hand towards @entity11 during her points victory @entity9 said : ' it 's going to be exciting boxing in front of such a big crowd but i know what it 's like and i will be taking that experience into the ring with me ' the first time round it was all new to me but now i 'm a lot more experienced and i 'm prepared for it			1
' @entity16 edged a tight and absorbing contest against @entity47 's @entity46 to realise her long - held dream of a gold medal clash with @entity9			1
the @entity50 21 - year - old struggled initially to get to grips with her opponent 's come - forward style but looked more at ease in the later stages and did just enough to deserve her victory			2
@entity16 said : ' months ago i said my dream was to fight @entity2 in the @entity7 final and when i go to bed tonight i will dream of that gold medal hanging round my beck			1
' i know if i perform to the best of my ability i can beat her			0
she is the golden girl and i 'm only a baby but in the ring it 's a different story			2
' @entity27 boxer @entity67 is guaranteed at least a silver medal after being given a walkover into the men 's super-heavyweight final			1
londoner @entity74 's @entity73 opponent @entity72 failed a pre-fight medical meaning @entity74 will progress straight into the gold medal match on saturday			2
@entity78 's shock run in the men 's flyweight division came to an end at the hands of slick @entity84 @entity83 , who triumphed via a split decision			1
@entity87 teenager @entity86 had delighted the home fans with wins over world number one @entity92 and @entity27 's @entity91			1
but he was forced to settle for a bronze medal after @entity83 stepped up in the pace in the final round to claim victory by the narrowest of margins			0
in control : 2012 @entity24 champion @entity9 connects with a right hand during another impressive performance on the brink : @entity9 is one fight away from becoming the first female @entity7 champion and @entity108 @entity107 saw the defence of his title slip away after an accidental head clash brought a premature end to his clash with @entity114			1
the @entity17 man was ruled unfit to continue after sustaining a bloody gash above his right eye and the contest was sent to the scorecards			2
@entity114 was handed victory by virtue of his stronger first round and @entity107 said : " it is not the outcome i would have wanted			0
' i would rather have gone the three rounds and lost all three rounds to him , he 's a world - class fighter			0
' @entity27 bantamweight @entity129 booked his place in the bantamweight final against @entity132 after easily outpointing @entity133 of @entity134			0
and @entity129 insisted he would not change the tactics that have taken him to his first major final because of @entity114 's obvious injury			2
jumping for joy : @entity84 's @entity83 ( left ) celebrates beating @entity139 's @entity78 ( right ) @entity129 said : ' you just have to not take any notice at all and concentrate on the tactics the coach gives you			0
and i know for a fact that if i perform to those tactics , i 'll beat him			0
' @entity27 team - mate @entity147 was forced to settle for a bronze medal after being outpointed by @entity151 squad team - mate @entity149			0
@entity147 's better first round was not rewarded on the scorecards and @entity149 's sharper , back - foot style saw him reach saturday 's light - welterweight final			1
a gold medal for @entity149 in front of his home fans will come in sharp contrast to his early exit from @entity25 but the @entity162 fighter insisted his @entity24 disappointment is in the past			0
@entity149 said : ' i 've been dreaming of this moment for four years and i ca n't wait to win a gold medal in front of the @entity139 fans			0
' the @entity24 have been and gone and i 've been looking forward since then			0
i 've put all my losses right and my form has been improving all the time			0
' @entity108 @entity171 was outclassed by @entity172 of @entity173 , who won when @entity171 's corner threw in the towel midway through the final round .			2
