friends say @entity1 has decided against taking the full - time job in the @entity3 it was billed as the dream job that would make @entity1 a household name in @entity3			1
but more than four months after the headline - grabbing announcement that she was to join the @entity11 network as a special correspondent in a £ 400,000 deal , she has yet to be seen on screen – and friends say she has decided against taking up a full - time job in the @entity3			1
@entity17 of @entity19 ’s sister has shot a series of reports for the long - running today show in rural @entity23 , but none has seen the light of day			2
and it was only when @entity27 asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to @entity1 explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the @entity3			1
the source said : ‘ there were talks and @entity1 did a test shoot which went really well			1
but for various reasons , a regular show with @entity1 is n’t going to happen			1
ultimately she did n’t want to commit herself to a big job in the @entity3			1
she ’s got a boyfriend in @entity39 and her family in the @entity41			0
it was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind			0
‘ she will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis			0
‘ @entity11 were really pleased with the test shoot , but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent , which is what @entity11 wanted			1
it was @entity1 ’s decision not to go ahead			1
it ’s not where she sees her future			0
’ one @entity11 insider said : ‘ @entity1 – or the lack of her – has been the talk of the company			1
everyone is wondering what has happened to her ? ‘ there was all that fanfare when she went off to @entity23 , and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio			0
but there ’s been nothing but silence for months			0
it ’s clear that someone has had reservations – but whether that ’s from @entity11 ’s side or her side , who knows ? ‘ it seems odd that they should make such a fuss of her and be so public and then go so silent			1
‘ normally , after a big build - up like that , you ’d get the talent on air fast and give her a big push			0
it does n’t feel right at all			0
’ in @entity23 , @entity1 donned tight jeans , a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a @entity93 bar , rode a horse in the shadow of the @entity96 , and visited tourist sights in a cowboy town			2
interviewees were told the story would air within about ten days of the shoot last november – but have been left disappointed			0
‘ we ’re wondering what happened to the report , ’ says @entity102 , manager of the @entity103 in @entity104 , where @entity1 filmed			2
‘ i contacted the producer , but they do n’t have any information about when it might air			0
she seemed quite at home , relaxed and enjoying herself			0
’ novelist @entity123 , who attended @entity1 ’s filming session , says : ‘ @entity1 seemed tiny and sweet , but maybe a bit overwhelmed there were so many people there – two or three cameramen , producers , sound technicians and bodyguards , all on a fairly small dance floor , dancing to the band one @entity135			2
a cowboy taught her to dance a two - step and she picked it up pretty quickly			0
but @entity11 seemed to be making a lot of fuss over a very small story			2
’ @entity142 , 66 , a regular at the @entity144 bar , said : ‘ i was asked by @entity11 if i ’d be filmed dancing with @entity1			1
i had no idea who she is			0
my daughter told me , “ she ’s @entity151 ’s sister ! ” and i said : “ who ’s she ? ” i do n’t know what happened to the today story , and i do n’t much care – i do n’t have a tv			0
’ @entity1 ’s @entity11 deal was initially touted as ‘ provisional ’ , although the network has a history of signing those related to the great and the good			1
other @entity11 correspondents have included @entity162 , @entity164 ’s daughter @entity165 , and princess @entity167 ’s brother @entity166			2
the abortive @entity3 tv career is another false start for @entity1 , after her party - planning book celebrate and column for the @entity172 both flopped .			1

four months *ago* it was announced @entity1 would join @entity11
she has yet to be seen on screen but was reportedly offered £ 400,000 deal
friends now say she has decided against taking a full - time job in the @entity3
