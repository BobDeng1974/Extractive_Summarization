' we want to protect these increases and can not afford a pay rise on top of increments - which disproportionately reward the highest earners - without risking frontline jobs			2
' we remain keen to meet with the unions to discuss how we can work together to make the @entity3 pay system fairer			2
' @entity155 , director of employment relations and reward at the @entity3 employers organisation , said : ' it is regrettable that members of the @entity14 have agreed to take industrial action along with some of the other @entity3 trades unions			1
