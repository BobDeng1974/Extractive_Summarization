by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there were no standing ovations yesterday or headline mentions on the prime - time news for @entity6			1
instead it was the largely anonymous grind on the unforgiving proving grounds of the @entity10 qualifying event at @entity11 — a world far removed from the limelight he enjoyed 12 months ago			0
as he battled away in the second preliminary round against @entity19 ’s @entity18 — finally losing 3 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 at 8.15pm in front of barely a dozen spectators — the scene could hardly have contrasted more sharply with the first round proper last year , when he sensationally beat world no 1 @entity24 in straight sets on @entity26 1			1
@entity27 : @entity6 defeated @entity24 in the first round of the @entity29 the curse ? @entity6 has suffered a miserable nine months since beating @entity24 at @entity31 after beating @entity24 we quickly came to know that he was nicknamed ‘ @entity33 ’ ( because of a tattoo on his shoulder ) , the experience providing him with the biggest high of his career			1
that turned out to be the precursor to a miserable nine months			0
in fact , you could say that @entity6 is just one victim of what might be termed the @entity44			1
how else to describe the subsequent woes of so many who made a splash at what was a dramatic championships ? men ’s champion @entity57 , semi-finalists @entity49 and @entity51 , @entity53 ’s conqueror @entity52 , women ’s finalist @entity54 , standout home performer @entity56 — not much has gone right for any of them since			1
for @entity6 , a genial 30 - year - old from @entity60 , the fall has been steeper than most and was more immediate , for he did not even get to play in the next round after dumping out @entity24 — who had come into the tournament having swept all before him for months			1
@entity6 ’s problems have been with his shoulder and he barely had time to take in the scale of his achievement against @entity24 before starting to fear the worst			1
grass roots : after winning @entity10 , @entity57 has undergone back surgery and has n't won a title since ‘ i was staying in a house in @entity73 and i went out to an @entity75 restaurant with a party of about 10 other @entity78 players and coaches that evening , ’ he recalled			1
‘ a lot of people recognised me in there , which was great because it does not happen so much , but inside i knew already that my shoulder was really bad and i could n’t sleep			0
i had to say everything was fine in public , but i was ready to pull out			0
’ he duly did so , and after a period of rest followed by further attempts at playing , he succumbed to what had been looking inevitable : surgery on his right shoulder			2
when it took place , on october 10 , they found a tear in a tendon almost a centimetre long			0
in fact , it was fairly miraculous he had soldiered on for so long			0
the news left @entity6 worried for his future in the game , let alone when he might come back			1
under the knife : @entity56 reached the fourth round last year but is set to miss the rest of the season after surgery on her wrist ‘ beating @entity24 was the biggest win but it was the start of the worst period of my career , it has been very tough , ’ he revealed			1
‘ i was n’t confident about being able to come back at all after the surgery , i am just glad to be back here and am grateful they gave me the wildcard into qualifying			2
‘ i am as physically fit as i have ever been because for five months i did nothing but physical work , it was very frustrating			0
i started practising again in early april			0
’ he came into @entity10 qualifying having played only one professional tournament , a tiny futures - level event in @entity78 where he managed to reach the final			0
downward spiral : @entity54 has not won two consecutive matches this year after reaching last year 's final it is evident that he still can not serve with his old potency , but he is grateful for small mercies			1
‘ after what the surgeon said when he saw what was wrong with my shoulder , there was a doubt i would play again , so i can only be happy with being back here at all , ’ he said			2
during the dark winter months , he broadly resisted the temptation to wallow in nostalgia and re-watch his great match against @entity24			2
@entity57 ( champion ) needed a back operation and has not won a title @entity149 ( semi-finalist ) lost eight straight matches from february to may , slipped to 24th in the @entity152 ( semi-finalist ) had left wrist surgery in march , out at least until @entity154 ( beat @entity53 ) still only 89th in the rankings , has railed against upheavals in his beloved @entity157 ( finalist ) has not won more than two consecutive matches this year , faces huge drop from ranking of @entity160 ( fourth round ) had wrist surgery after @entity163 and will miss most of the season			1
with the grass relatively lush and fresh that day , the two - time champion simply could not get sufficient purchase on his groundstrokes and the flair of @entity170 completely deflated him by the end			2
‘ i did watch the match one time , just after the operation , ’ said @entity6			2
‘ my main memory is that i tried to keep going for it even when i was nervous			0
i had to attack because you ca n’t stick on the baseline against @entity24			2
grass is n't greener : @entity6 was told he may never play tennis again after surgery on his shoulder ‘ mentally it is very tough against him because there is always the fear that he is going to come back			1
‘ when i won the first set i thought , “ if i lose in four i ’ve still played a good match ”			0
and when i won the second i thought , “ if i lose in five i have still made it a good match ”			0
‘ even when i went out to serve for the match at 5 - 4 in the third there were thoughts that if i do n’t win this set he might beat me			0
it was only when i got to 40 - 15 in that game that i thought , “ i ’m going to do this ” ’			0
’ as with several others who made their name at @entity29 , @entity6 has found there have been great challenges since .			1

several players who shone at @entity29 have seen fortunes fade
after defeating @entity24 , @entity6 was told he might never play again and failed to qualify for this year 's championships
men 's champion @entity57 has not won a title since back surgery
*homegrown* *surprise* @entity56 is unlikely to play again this season
players *including* @entity54 and @entity49 have also suffered from the ' @entity44 '
