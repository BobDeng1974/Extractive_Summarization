by @entity0 published : 05:30 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 7 february 2013 a girl was just two heartbeats from death - when she was given a heart transplant moments before her own heart failed			1
@entity6 , 12 , who was born with a congenital heart defect , suffered a stroke last year , and was wheeled in for life - saving surgery 10 days later			1
when removed from a patient , most hearts continue to beat for up to two minutes - but @entity6 's stopped while still in the surgeon 's hand , leading medics to conclude she had only seconds to live			1
@entity6 ( pictured in hospital , left ) suffered a stroke in april 2012 and received a transplant 10 days later			1
she was moments from death during the operation but pulled through			0
she is now returning to normal life ( right ) now @entity6 , from @entity23 , @entity24 , is recovering and able to play with her friends and is going back to school			1
mother @entity27 , 46 , and father @entity28 , 43 , an aerial and satellite engineer , rushed @entity6 to @entity31 hospital after she suffered a stroke in april 2012			1
ten days later @entity6 - who also suffers from cerebral palsy - was given the transplant that she desperately needed			1
her parents even bought her a puppy , called @entity37 , before she went into hospital - as motivation for her to get better			2
mrs @entity6 said : ' @entity40 was born 10 weeks early , with a congenital heart defect			1
she was tiny , just 3lb 7oz			0
' she was on life support for two months before slowly improving			2
she had her first pacemaker when she weighed 6lb 10oz - at around eight months old			1
' we struggled on with her condition for the next few years			0
she then had another pacemaker in 2008			2
' we were devastated to learn in september 2011 that her only way forward was a heart transplant			1
' recovering : @entity6 was fitted with a pacemaker twice before she received a donor heart @entity6 : her parents bought the lhasa apso to give their daughter an incentive to get better mrs @entity6 went on : ' she had a stroke in april 2012 and was rushed to @entity56			1
ten days later we were told there was a heart for her - which was flown up from @entity60			1
' when they found a heart for her , it was overwhelming for us - but we did n't want to scare her or disappoint her			2
' she was in theatre for ten hours			2
i was terrified - i did n't know if it was the last time i would get to see her			0
' they sent a message down from surgery to say her old heart had served her well - but we were n't sure what they meant			2
' we knew she was cutting it fine			0
the next morning , her surgeon mr @entity74 said that when he took her heart out there was just two beats left - then the heart failed			2
' normally they can beat independently - but after two beats @entity6 's just went			1
' it was a very close - run thing			0
we felt huge relief and the surgery was just in time			0
we had no idea how close she was to dying			0
we were shocked that it had got so bad			0
she was sedated for days afterwards and came out of hospital three weeks later			2
' the first thing she said when she came round was " where 's my dog @entity37 ? " i was so relieved			0
' the first year is really tricky , as we could never be sure that her body would accept the @entity94 hospital has one of the highest survival rates in the world			0
' since the transplant she 's brighter and happier , she 's back to her old cheeky self			2
' before , her lips were blue and she used to have to wear three pairs of socks because of poor circulation			0
' she 's going back to school and is working with the physio to help her cerebral palsy			0
she wants to get back to swimming and walking her dog @entity37			0
' all the people at the hospital were amazing and we 're extremely grateful			0
' @entity6 was in and out of hospital after she was born with a congenital heart defect @entity27 said she was terrified when her daughter @entity6 went in for the transplant op , in case it was the last time she saw her her surgeon @entity74 , 56 , said : ' her heart was on its last legs - she would n't have survived too long			1
the transplant came just in time for her			0
' when i did the transplant her old heart seemed to fade away very quickly - suggesting it did not have long left			1
' if she had n't had the transplant when she did , she could have died suddenly			1
' it 's wonderful to know she 's getting back to school and very satisfying to see her getting back to normal life			0
' if a patient survives the first year after a transplant , like @entity6 has , they 're looking at a good outcome			1
i 'm delighted for her			0
' @entity136 , transplant coordinator , from @entity137 , @entity31 , said most hearts beat for up to a minute or two after removal			0
she said : ' @entity6 's heart was obviously a very poorly heart			1
the nature of the muscle inside the heart is so unique , a healthy heart - not that you would remove one of those - will usually beat even when it is removed from the body for some time			0
' the donor heart is healthy , but the body is cooled so it is not beating when it is removed			1
once that heart is sewn into the transplant patient it often begins beating of its own accord once it is warmed and blood starts flowing			2

@entity6 was born with a congenital heart defect and fitted with her first pacemaker when eight months old
in september 2011 her parents were told she would need a transplant but she suffered a stroke in april 2012
ten days later she received a donor heart , and nearly died during the op
