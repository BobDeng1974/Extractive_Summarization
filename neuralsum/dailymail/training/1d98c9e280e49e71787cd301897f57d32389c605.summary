the last eight days have provided a portal into @entity2 ’s future and while there is some cause for encouragement , there will also be cause for concern			1
not before time , there has been news of @entity12 ’s expansion , the addition of 8,500 seats , something the club have long required if they are to remain among the elite			0
but here , for the second time in little more than a week , was a view of life at @entity2 without their talismanic captain , the player who remains the heartbeat of this club			2

when , however , the result of that is a performance much like their display against @entity99 the previous weekend , when @entity25 decided he needed to start resting 34 - year - old @entity27 for certain games , there is sure to be a heightened sense of anxiety			1
in fairness to @entity25 and his players , their football improved before @entity27 was unleashed from the bench in the second half against @entity99 that concluded with a winning goal from @entity44			2
but there was a lack of urgency in that first - half display that was evident again here , and a lack of authority in the midfield area @entity27 so likes to command			1
until he came on in the 66th minute , @entity2 were unimpressive , although credit should be given to a @entity36 defence well organised by @entity121			1
the home side were tentative when they should have been attacking with real intensity , fearful of what @entity36 might do to them when they should have had the confidence to be crushing their visitors			1
@entity2 and @entity36 players pose for a photo to mark the 100 years anniversary since the @entity132 football game @entity48 ( centre ) battles for the ball with @entity36 duo @entity64 ( left ) and @entity66 @entity136 midfielder @entity50 ( left ) tries to escape the attention of @entity64 during their saturday afternoon encounter @entity66 ( right ) falls to the ground after being fouled by @entity2 midfielder @entity49 at @entity12 @entity2 starlet @entity53 ( centre ) failed to ignite the hosts attack against their determined opponents mins @entity144 @entity2 total 107.4 66.7 @entity48 90 11.3 7.0 @entity49 90 11.1 6.9 @entity47 90 11.1 6.9 @entity36 total 109.6 68.1 @entity66 90 11.3 7.0 @entity64 90 10.9 6.8 @entity69 90 10.4 6.5 data courtesy of the @entity146 , the @entity147 of the @entity148 if @entity25 thought his players had shown great character to respond as they had after their dreadful defeat at @entity153 , and he said as much in his programme notes , there was little sign of it during this encounter			1
it clearly worries supporters who were strangely quiet until @entity27 came on as a replacement for @entity50			1
they can see it too			0
they can see how @entity27 almost single - handedly raised the tempo of @entity2 ’s play , just as they can see the size of the task facing @entity25 : the need to identify new leaders now that @entity169 and @entity170 have gone and @entity27 could be leaving too if he decides against signing the new contract he has been offered			1
even though @entity27 was unable to inspire a goal that would have secured a third successive league win for @entity2 , @entity25 acknowledged the need to find players who can fill the void in his captain ’s absence			1
‘ it is very hard to replace that quality , ’ said @entity25			0
‘ you see that pass when @entity183 first came on ; not too many in the whole league could play that , that quality			0
he still has that talent , he has world - class ability and that is something of course we will need			0
‘ but we ca n’t always rely on @entity183			0
his talent is world class but that contribution has to come from the team			0
it ca n’t be up to him every single game to be the catalyst			0
he was excellent when he came on and of course he plays on tuesday			0
’ @entity2 are lacking in other areas too			2
they have scored just seven league goals at home this season — only @entity206 and @entity207 have inferior records — and that owes much to the absence of @entity211			0
but what they really missed was any stature in midfield , which was something @entity36 clearly tried to exploit			2
@entity27 immediately took the captain 's armband from team - mate @entity48 upon his second half arrival the 34 - year - old ( right ) was immediately in the thick of the action but could n't help the hosts find that elusive winner @entity27 ( left ) plays a pass under pressure from @entity36 's tireless midfielder @entity64 during saturday 's @entity148 clash @entity36 striker @entity226 ( centre ) battles for the ball against @entity47 ( left ) and @entity46 at times @entity2 ’s back four almost buckled , with @entity45 forced to make a desperate challenge to deny the advancing @entity69			1
@entity36 ’s appeals for a penalty were ignored , which looked just about fair enough			2
@entity2 responded with a purposeful attack down the right flank , @entity54 meeting @entity50 ’s cross with a header that flew only narrowly wide			1
and it was not long before @entity2 threatened again , with @entity51 unleashing a low shot that finished up in the side - netting			1
but it amounted to a fairly uninspiring first half , with @entity2 creating just those two chances			2
the second half started much like the first had concluded , with @entity36 showing more energy and determination until @entity27 injected fresh impetus into @entity2			1
the home side were better then , for sure			0
@entity51 unleashed two reasonable efforts , the second of which forced a fine save from @entity59 after a terrific run from @entity53 , who then felt he should have been awarded a penalty after a challenge by @entity61			0
it would have been harsh , and it was not even mentioned by @entity25 afterwards			0
but then he had wider , more significant concerns			0
@entity46 ( left ) attempts to tackle @entity36 substitute @entity65 during the closing stages of the match			2

@entity27 came on as a 67th substitute for @entity50 in @entity2 's draw against @entity36
the @entity136 skipper failed to ignite the hosts when he came on as they failed to break down their *resilient* visitors
34 - year - old 's *omission* from the starting line - up was ahead of tuesday 's crucial @entity41 tie against @entity43
result sees @entity2 drop down to ninth on 21 points , while @entity36 remain 14th with 15 points
