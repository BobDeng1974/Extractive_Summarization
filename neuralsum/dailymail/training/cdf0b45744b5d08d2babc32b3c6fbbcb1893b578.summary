dubbed the ' @entity21 ' , the pair rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles ( 8,383 km ) for human flight in a gas balloon on thursday , which had been set on the only previous manned trans - @entity4 flight , in 1981			1
when they eclipsed the distance record , a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the @entity32 in @entity14 with people posing for pictures with the mile counter			2
@entity36 , a mission support control worker at the site , said : ' we 're really excited and just now concentrating on getting them to a nice safe landing			0
' to set new distance and durations records the team needed to beat the existing records by one per cent			0

5261 miles or 8467 km. ' the pilots , dubbed the two eagles , have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the @entity4 , according to their team they had been aiming to land in @entity55 or the @entity7 but unexpected weather forced them to change course and they are now expected to arrive in @entity13 , @entity14 , tomorrow ' we 're not taking any time to celebrate , ' @entity59 , head of mission control , told @entity63			1
' we have a lot of work we have to do , and we 're just taking this flight one hour at a time			0
' the pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours , five minutes and 50 seconds , set in 1978 by a team of three pilots in @entity71 - the first to cross the @entity72 by helium balloon			1
in 1981 , the @entity74 , manned by several members of the same team , was also the first gas balloon to successfully cross the @entity4 and set the record for distance			0
@entity6 and @entity8 , who named their balloon in honour of the the @entity71 team , should pass the existing record at about 3.50pm gmt after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes			2
the balloon , which relies solely on an enclosed chamber of helium gas for lift , is different from hot air balloons and so - called @entity91 balloons , which rely on both hot air and lighter - than - air gas			0
the pair , who have been equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater , are suspended beneath the balloon in a tiny , cramped capsule dubbed the ' @entity21 ' , they rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles ( 8,383 km ) for human flight in a gas balloon on thursday , which had been set on the only previous manned trans - @entity4 flight , in 1981 the pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours , five minutes and 50 seconds , set in 1978 @entity6 and @entity8 should pass the existing duration record at about 3.50pm gmt after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes the huge helium - filled envelope , made of @entity112 and carbon - fibre , carries the team in a tiny capsule which sits beneath and is designed to stay aloft for up to 10 days			1
@entity116 said the cramped conditions of the capsule has not affected the pilots , who have subsisted on a diet that includes fresh fruit , freeze - dried hikers ' meals , beef jerky and the occasional hot meal from a small stove			0

the team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there 's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down although they estimate the balloon will land in @entity13 , @entity14			2
a network of balloonists has been established across the @entity7 and in southern @entity55 who can serve as chase crews , those who are on the ground to help with tethering the capsule and rounding up the balloon 's envelope as it deflates			2
the volunteers are ready to travel within a 200 - mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear			0
their records must be officially certified by the @entity151 and the @entity152 , which can take months			0

pilots @entity6 and @entity8 traveled 5,260 miles by balloon
the ' two @entity21 ' have smashed the record for distance by helium balloon
they left @entity11 on sunday and had aimed to land in @entity55 or the @entity7
but **due** to unexpected weather they are **due** to land in @entity14 tomorrow
