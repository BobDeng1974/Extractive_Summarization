@entity1 announced on sunday that an area of the @entity7 , near existing settlements at @entity9 , south of @entity10 , has been designated as ‘ state land ’ which means it can be used for homes for @entity1			1

the 1,000 acres of @entity3 land which is being seized is also near the city @entity1 has been criticised for its move to seize 1,000 acres of @entity3 land			1
it is expected to be used to extend settlements close to the existing @entity9 settlement bloc ( above ) near @entity10 @entity1 's land grab will extend existing settlements around @entity10 , which is already host to the @entity33 settlement ( above )			2
like most @entity7 settlements it is heavily guarded with a perimeter fence land grab : @entity1 soldiers swooped on 1,000 acres of @entity3 territory yesterday , sending a shock wave of anger across the @entity43 world ( stock image ) @entity1 anti-settlement group @entity45 accused prime minister @entity46 of building obstacles to the creation of a @entity3 state and a lasting peace			1
mr @entity5 , addressing mps on the summer crises in @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity17 , used unusually strong language to condemn the move			0
he said that while @entity1 had a right to defend its civilians against the ‘ terrorist tactics ’ of @entity61 , this did not mean supporting all the @entity1 government ’s decisions			1
‘ the appropriation of nearly 1,000 acres of land in the @entity7 near @entity10 is utterly deplorable , ’ he said			0
‘ settlements are illegal under international law and will do nothing to create the kind of peace process we all want , and we urge the @entity1 government to reverse this decision			2
’ foreign secretary @entity74 said it was ‘ a particularly ill - judged decision that comes at a time when the priority must be to build on the ceasefire in @entity17			0
’ the @entity79 also criticised the move , calling it ‘ counterproductive to @entity1 ’s stated goal of a negotiated two - state solution with the @entity3 ’			1
protest : @entity1 's actions in the @entity7 have led to large - scale protests by @entity3 , like this last week tensions : recent tensions have culminated in a series of heated clashes between @entity3 youths and @entity1 soldiers , who remain in the occupied territory mr @entity5 has faced criticism over his response to the crisis , in which he has staunchly backed @entity1 ’s right to defend itself in the face of constant rocket attacks from @entity61			1
but he has long criticised the illegal settlements in the @entity7 and @entity100 , where around half a million @entity1 live			0
@entity1 captured the @entity7 from @entity101 during the @entity102 in 1967			0
@entity103 said the step was taken in response to the kidnapping and killing of three @entity109 teens by @entity61 militants in the area in june			1
tensions stoked by the incident quickly spread to @entity1 's border with @entity17 , which is controlled by @entity61 , and the two sides engaged in a seven - week war that ended on tuesday with an @entity118 - brokered ceasefire			1
the notice published on sunday by the @entity1 military gave no reason for the land appropriation decision			1
@entity45 , which opposes @entity1 settlement activities in the @entity7 , territory the @entity3 seek for a state , said the appropriation was meant to turn a site where 10 families now live adjacent to a @entity109 seminary into a permanent settlement			1
construction of a major settlement at the location , known as ' @entity133 ' , has been mooted by @entity1 since 2000			0
last year , the government invited bids for the building of 1,000 housing units at the site			0
@entity45 said the land seizure was the largest announced by @entity1 in the @entity7 since the 1980s and that anyone with ownership claims had 45 days to appeal			2
a local @entity3 mayor said @entity3 owned the tracts and harvested olive trees on them			0
@entity1 has come under intense international criticism over its settlement activities , which most countries regard as illegal under international law and a major obstacle to the creation of a viable @entity3 state in any future peace deal			2
@entity154 , a spokesman for @entity156 - backed @entity3 president @entity155 , called on @entity1 to cancel the appropriation			2
' this decision will lead to more instability			0
this will only inflame the situation after the war in @entity17 , ' @entity154 said			0
@entity1 prime minister @entity46 broke off @entity79 - brokered peace talks with @entity155 in april after the @entity3 leader reached a reconciliation deal with @entity61 , the @entity167 movement that dominates the @entity17			1
in a series of remarks after an open - ended ceasefire halted the @entity17 war , @entity46 repeated his position that @entity155 would have to sever his alliance with @entity61 for a peace process with @entity1 to resume			1
unstable : a spokesman for @entity156 - backed @entity3 president @entity155 ( pictured ) , called on @entity1 to cancel the appropriation , saying it would lead to ' more instability ' and inflame the war at odds : president @entity180 has been at odds with @entity1 prime minister @entity46 over settlements since taking office in 2009			2
this was the latest point of contention between @entity187 and its top @entity189 ally @entity1 , which also differ over @entity191 nuclear talks the administration of president @entity180 , who has been at odds with @entity46 over settlements since taking office in 2009 , pushed back against the land decision			2
it was the latest point of contention between @entity187 and its top @entity189 ally @entity1 , which also differ over @entity191 nuclear talks			0
' we have long made clear our opposition to continued settlement activity , ' said the @entity203 official , who declined to be identified			0
' this announcement , like every other settlement announcement @entity1 makes , planning step they approve and construction tender they issue , is counterproductive to @entity1 's stated goal of a negotiated two - state solution with the @entity3 , ' the official said			1
after the collapse of the last round of @entity79 - brokered peace talks , @entity79 officials cited settlement construction as one of the main reasons for the breakdown , while also faulting the @entity3 for signing a series of international treaties and conventions			0
@entity1 has said construction at @entity133 would not constitute the establishment of a new settlement because the site is officially designated a neighbourhood of an existing one , @entity228 , several km ( miles ) down the road			0
some 500,000 @entity1 live among 2.4 million @entity3 in the @entity7 and @entity100 , territory that the jewish state captured in the 1967 @entity189 war .			0
