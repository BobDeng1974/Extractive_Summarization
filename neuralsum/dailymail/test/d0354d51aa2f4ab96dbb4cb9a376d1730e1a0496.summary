@entity1 boss @entity0 has admitted his side need to pull off a couple of ' crazy results ' if they are to preserve their @entity6 status in a frantic end - of - season run - in			1
the @entity8 head to @entity9 on saturday without a win in five games and perching just two points above the bottom three after wins last week for @entity14 and @entity15			1
and @entity0 hopes the unpredictable nature of this season 's top flight will continue into the final weeks , with the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 still due to visit the @entity23			1
@entity0 admitted his side need some ' crazy results ' if they 're going to avoid relegation from the league @entity0 said : ' we have just witnessed over the last week all sorts of crazy results can happen and we need to make sure we get one or two of those , that 's for sure			1
' we 've proved this year that we 're capable but we 're under no illusions how difficult it is going to be			0
it is all to play for and it is another big weekend but we have been saying that for the best part of four months			0
' the way it 's gone all season i would n't be surprised if it goes right down to the wire			0
last week people were saying @entity14 and @entity15 were gone but all of a sudden they 've produced a result and they 're back in it again			0
' @entity1 face high - flying @entity9 knowing that they ca n't afford to slip up with the bottom three closing @entity0 's biggest selection dilemma for the trip to the south coast is whether to keep faith in goalkeeper @entity50 after a pair of high - profile blunders in recent weeks			1
@entity50 was at fault for the opening goal in the 3 - 1 defeat at @entity56 last week and also made a mistake in the loss to @entity59 a fortnight ago , but @entity0 sprung to the defence of the under - fire 33 - year - old			2
@entity0 said : ' when you 're a goalkeeper the one thing the @entity6 does is highlight mistakes and unfortunately @entity50 will be the first to admit he has been disappointed over the last couple of weeks			1
@entity50 ( right ) could lose his place in the side after a pair of blunders in @entity1 's recent defeats ' i have n't made a decision one way or the other , but @entity50 is a very , very good goalkeeper			2
despite his mistakes he is still a top - class keeper			0
' veteran @entity76 is pushing to replace @entity50 in @entity0 's starting line - up while midfielder @entity78 is also set to make a welcome return from suspension			2
however @entity82 is ruled out after his red card last week , @entity81 is ineligible to play against his parent club and @entity85 is an injury doubt			0
@entity78 ( left ) and @entity87 are in line to return for the @entity8 after suspension and injury and @entity0 acknowledged his side face a major battle to boost their survival prospects against @entity94 's high - flying @entity9 whom he rates as the best outside the traditional ' big guns '			1
' we will have to be somewhere near our best if we are going to get anything out of them because i rate them very highly , ' added @entity0			2
' they lost three or four players for big money but they have bought well			0
they have maintained their position at the top end of the league so fair play to @entity94 and the way the club is run from top to bottom			0

@entity0 admits @entity1 need to pull off ' crazy results ' to avoid the drop
the @entity8 still have to play @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22
@entity1 are just two points away from the bottom three of the @entity6
