@entity1 's political turmoil intensified yesterday after @entity2 admitted it had been forced to stop using @entity3 as a ‘ scare tactic ’ in @entity5 – because the prime minister is more popular with voters than mr @entity1			1
@entity2 leader @entity8 admitted that the party had ditched its mantra of ‘ vote @entity11 – get @entity3 ’ in favour of ‘ vote @entity11 – get @entity17 ’ , after strategists vetoed plans to portray the election as a straight fight between mr @entity1 and mr @entity3			1
mr @entity8 said : ‘ it ’s the same argument , but the “ @entity17 ” thing has a much greater resonance			2
among working - class @entity5 , voting @entity17 is associated with @entity18 , more so than @entity3			1
’ unpopularity contest : labour leader @entity1 and @entity17 prime minister @entity3 the u-turn comes barely a week after mr @entity1 insisted during a visit to @entity25 that the point of the @entity27 was ‘ who is going to be prime minister , is it going to be @entity3 or @entity1 ? ’ a devastating set of polls by @entity17 peer lord @entity31 in @entity2 ’s @entity5 heartlands last week revealed mr @entity3 was considerably more popular than mr @entity1 in @entity5			1
in 15 out of the 16 constituencies studied , including several of @entity2 ’s supposedly ‘ safe ’ seats , more voters said they were either satisfied with @entity3 or preferred him to @entity1 than said they would prefer the @entity2 leader to be prime minister			1
if the findings were repeated at the election , mr @entity1 ’s party could be wiped off @entity5 ’s political map , losing 35 of its 41 seats to the @entity11 and allowing @entity43 ’s @entity42 to play a key power - broking role in a new @entity45			1
@entity2 leader @entity8 ( right ) and @entity46 @entity1 pictured in @entity25 last year a spokesman for the @entity5 conservatives said : ‘ most scots prefer @entity3 to @entity1 as prime minister and it now appears that @entity8 agrees with them			1
' his election strategy has been laid bare – avoid all mention of his leader , drag up 40 - year - old memories of @entity18 , and hope no one notices			1
it ’s negative and weak			2
’ the embarrassment for mr @entity1 emerged as his health spokesman @entity59 appeared to be positioning with increasing confidence as the left - wing candidate in any post-election leadership contest			2
mr @entity59 lavished praise on @entity65 leader @entity64 , whose union votes will be crucial , and criticised @entity67			0
in particular , he distanced himself from @entity69 ’s infamous comment that he was ‘ intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich ’			0
mr @entity59 told @entity71 : ‘ i do n’t think any person in the @entity73 feels relaxed about the gaps in society			0
’ his remarks came as former business secretary mr @entity69 went on to the @entity78 4 today programme to deny that he had ‘ sounded out ’ former home secretary @entity79 last autumn about trying to topple mr @entity1			2
meanwhile , lord @entity31 yesterday released revised poll data that shows @entity81 is facing the loss of his @entity84 seat			0
it is the second poll in a week to indicate the @entity86 leader will lose his seat to @entity2			0
the initial poll last november put the @entity86 narrowly ahead , but the revised results show them three points behind @entity2			0
a second corrected poll saw figures for the seat of @entity94 , where @entity96 leader @entity95 is standing , revised			0
the @entity97 ’ five - point lead over mr @entity95 has been reduced to one .			0

@entity2 have ditched the mantra after polls revealed popularity
@entity104 found @entity3 is more popular - even in @entity2 's @entity5 heartlands
in 15 out of 16 constituencies polled more voters said they were either satisfied with @entity3 or preferred him to @entity1
as a result @entity2 are *switching* mantra to ' vote @entity11 - get @entity17 '
@entity114 working - class @entity5 will associate it with @entity18 instead
strategy has been labelled ' negative and weak ' by @entity5 conservatives
