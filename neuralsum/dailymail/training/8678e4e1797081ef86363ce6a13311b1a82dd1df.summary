inspired by @entity0 's strike , here @entity13 takes a look at the five best - ever team goals ... @entity0 ( centre ) celebrates after scoring the opening goal against @entity5 on wednesday @entity0 ( right ) makes no mistake as he scores the opener for @entity2 in the @entity4 clash this graphic from the @entity22 shows the remarkable build - up to @entity0 's goal @entity25 ( @entity26 vs @entity27 and @entity28 , 2006 @entity29 ) this goal showed @entity26 at their very beautiful best			1
after winning their first game of the @entity29 in @entity35 against @entity36 , @entity26 would have been confident heading into the game against the highly - rated @entity27 and @entity28			2
and that confidence almost came across as arrogance when defensive midfielder @entity25 slotted home to finish off a 25 - pass move			2
sometimes ' tiki - taka ' style goals involve passing just for the very sake of it , but not this one			1
@entity26 started with the ball in their own half before gradually building up the play with some slick one - touch passes			1
eventually they made their way into the @entity27 box and , after a neat backheel into his path , @entity25 smashed home from 15 yards			0
@entity25 ( left ) celebrates after scoring for @entity26 against @entity27 and @entity28 in 2006 the defensive midfielder finished off a 25 - pass move which cut open the @entity27 defence @entity60 ( @entity61 vs @entity62 , 1970 @entity63 ) the samba stars of the seventies are widely regarded as one of the best teams of all time , blessed with the likes of @entity70 and @entity71 , and this goal encapsulates everything that was so majestic about them			1
after missing out on the @entity29 in @entity75 in 1966 , @entity61 were back with a bang in @entity77 , led out by marauding right back @entity60			0
the captain scored the clincher in a 4 - 1 victory over @entity62 at the iconic @entity81 , firing home a low drive into the bottom corner from the right - hand side			1
@entity61 toyed with the @entity86 , with a total of eight of their outfield players passing the ball - @entity91 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity70 , @entity95 , @entity71 , @entity96 and @entity60 - before the captain hammered home to seal the @entity29			2
@entity94 even had time to jink inside and outside of four @entity86 before continuing the move			0
@entity60 's finish followed a magnificent ball down the right - hand side from @entity70 after @entity91 pointed out that @entity60 was advancing at some speed			0
@entity60 ( right ) scores @entity61 's final goal in the 4 - 1 victory over @entity62 in the 1970 @entity29 final @entity61 skipper @entity60 ( left ) poses with @entity75 captain @entity105 before their @entity29 match in 1970 @entity107 ( @entity108 vs @entity109 , @entity110 2013/14 ) this goal wowed @entity108 fans and neutrals alike last season as the @entity115 cut through the @entity109 defence before @entity107 finished exquisitely			1
the intricate passing and fancy flicks between @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity75 midfielder @entity107 were simply sublime to watch			0
i implore you to watch this goal and not gasp if you have not seen it before , such is the beauty and precision of the move			0
the outrageous move sliced apart a @entity109 defence who just watched in awe as @entity108 showed what their neat passing can actually achieve at its very best			0
@entity107 then calmly slotted home to cap off a magnificent team goal			1
@entity107 sticks his thumb in his mouth as he celebrates scoring for @entity108 against @entity109 @entity120 ( left ) hugs @entity107 as they celkebrate in the corner after a brilliant team goal @entity141 ( @entity142 vs @entity143 , @entity110 2010/11 ) unfortunately this is not the sort of goal you would associate with @entity142 nowadays , but at the time under @entity149 they were flying high and sat fifth in the @entity110			1
the confidence was clearly flowing through the veins as they faced @entity143 in this match			0
despite going two goals down , wanderers were not to be denied and , having already pulled one back , the team put together a brilliant move to force an equaliser			1
with just a minute remaining , @entity159 slotted the ball through to @entity161 who was running away from goal			0
the big striker then backheeled the ball to @entity165 , who helped it on into the path of @entity141 to hit home			0
@entity141 ( right ) goes to high five @entity142 team - mate @entity165 after scoring vs @entity143 @entity159 ( second left ) puts his hands in the air to celebrate @entity141 ' ( centre ) goal @entity141 ' ( right ) goal was a brilliant team goal that saw the ball flicked around the box @entity178 ( @entity179 vs @entity180 , @entity181 2012/13 ) there is an almost endless list of @entity179 goals which you could choose from but we had to narrow it down to just one from the tiki - taka masters			1
but this goal , finished off by @entity190 , is sublime and shows everything that @entity179 are about when they are at their very best			0
the @entity193 giants were 1 - 0 down at the @entity194 approaching half - time against @entity180 but produced one of their most - exquisite passing triangles on the edge of the box			2
having kept possession for more than 20 seconds , suddenly the ball found its way to @entity203 who surged across the edge of the box at pace			0
he fed @entity190 who , in order to complete @entity179 's holy trio , played in @entity210			0
his pass - master team - mate then returned the ball to @entity190 before the latter finished into the bottom corner			2
@entity178 celebrates scoring for @entity179 against @entity180 in the @entity181 in 2012 @entity190 's ( right ) goal optimises everything that @entity179 's tiki - taka style is all about when done best			2
