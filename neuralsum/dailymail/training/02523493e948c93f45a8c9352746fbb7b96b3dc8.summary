@entity0 : legends in love by @entity4 @entity3 the undulating @entity6 may or may not have been a daffy comic actress of offbeat genius — what @entity4 @entity3 calls her ‘ soft simplicity ’ could equally have been the consequence of drugs , rather than talent			1
but what is beyond dispute is that she had terrible taste in men , illogically believing that , if a chap slapped her around , this ‘ confirmed for her just how much he cared about her ’			2
‘ i ca n’t remember the names of three - quarters of the men i slept with , ’ @entity6 once said — though she never forgot @entity22 , because he managed to give her the slip			1
@entity27 coaches , wig makers , casting agents , @entity30 , @entity31 , and numerous @entity32 : it was a catholic list			0
@entity6 with second husband @entity34 , a controlling and uncaring brute who drove her to overdosing on powerful sedatives the ill - fated pair arriving at a theatre together in 1955			1
their marriage broke down after just two years			2
‘ @entity45 , ’ @entity6 quickly learned , ‘ was n’t a place where an ambitious starlet could afford to be a prude			1
’ maybe not , but a dip into the actress ’s past suggests that what she hopelessly sought was a father figure — ‘ paternalistic guidance ’			0
@entity6 had needed considerable strength of character to survive an upbringing that involved suicide , illegitimacy , incest and schizophrenia			1
her mother was in the @entity60 , where she remained until 1967 , five years after her daughter ’s death			2
@entity6 herself was sent to the @entity64			1
‘ nobody ever treated @entity6 like a real daughter , ’ says @entity3			1
‘ nobody had ever held her			0
’ not with genuine warmth and affection , anyway			0
enter @entity34 , 12 years her senior			1
he had been star centre - fielder for the @entity73 , baseball ’s greatest living legend , who ’d won nine @entity78 championships and was the holder of a 56 - consecutive - game hitting streak			1
he seemed a solid sort , who ’d ‘ combat @entity6 ’s shortcomings and frailties ’			1
but he was also a colossal bore , as sports heroes tend to be			0
he once went to the @entity89 and came out saying , ‘ art bores me to tears ’			0
he now did nothing but drink , watch tv and chain - smoke			0
@entity34 and @entity6 pictured arriving in @entity96 from @entity97 , @entity98 in 1961			1
the former baseball player disliked @entity6 wearing what he deemed to be provocative clothing			1
@entity6 met him in 1952 , and they were married two years later			1
she made the mistake of imagining his taciturnity masked fascinating depths			0
‘ if his remoteness somehow annoyed her , it also served to pique her interest , ’ says @entity3 , who is as unconvinced as i am about @entity34 ’s psychological enigma			1
after a fashion , the couple did have something in common — @entity6 was mobbed by fans and reasoned that ‘ movie stars are n’t born , they ’re created			1
publicity is part of the manufacturing process ’			0
@entity34 , in his turn , had also known adulation			1
he almost grew wistful as he recalled the atmosphere in the stadium , ‘ having millions of people look at you with love and excitement while you stand alone getting ready to do something ’			0
@entity34 was the star centre - fielder for the @entity73 and loved the attention that fame brought him here may be the place to mention another thing that drew @entity6 to him : ‘ @entity34 ’s biggest bat is n’t the one he used at the plate , ’ she told @entity139			1

he dropped out of school in 1930 to play baseball , and was known as ‘ the @entity144 ’			2
he ’d been married before , to a singer called @entity146			0
if only @entity6 had found out more about this episode			2
@entity34 had grown to hate @entity146 for ‘ playing the effervescent hostess to family and friends ’ , and begrudged her any personality of her own			2
a woman , to his @entity154 way of thinking , had to cook , clean , run errands , ‘ be his sex partner when he was n’t in bed with someone else			0
it did n’t seem to occur to him that @entity146 might have her own needs ’			0
they were divorced in 1944 on the ground of his ‘ cruel indifference ’			1
history repeated itself with @entity6			2
@entity34 would scream at her if she wore a swimsuit — accusing her of looking like a whore			2
to him , women were always housewives or whores , nothing in between			0
he insisted @entity6 wore dresses with high necklines , and wanted to prevent her from appearing in films ‘ that exploited her sexuality ’			1
he expected clauses in her contracts to that effect , and demanded ‘ an active voice in choosing her roles ’			0
@entity34 read and screened @entity6 ’s fan mail and did n’t like it when she had to kiss the leading man			1
he tried to control her and , of all the people in the world , she was the one you could n’t control — certainly not by force			0
the tragedy is that , just at the very moment @entity6 was emerging as ‘ a shot in the arm for @entity45 ’ and world cinema , her boorish husband was intent on compelling and browbeating her to ‘ quit making movies to start a family , have babies ’			2
@entity34 had violent tantrums : ‘ he made such a racket and screamed so loudly that guests in a nearby room called the front desk			1
’ @entity6 's coffin is brought out at her funeral			1
the iconic beauty died of a sedative overdose @entity6 would appear in the morning with her face swollen and her eyes red			1
‘ @entity34 kept her up all night , every night , yelling and screaming at her			2
he ’d become an erupting volcano , spewing out lava and ash			0
’ enraged because ‘ his bride had surpassed him in popularity and renown ’ , @entity34 did his best to destroy @entity6 as an artist			1
she began showing up late , upsetting the director and producers			0
‘ she started taking sedatives			0
she became addicted and began drinking , and the combination of alcohol and pharmaceuticals screwed her up			0
’ she could n’t remember lines ‘ or if she did , she ’d slur them ’			0
she would collapse , develop bronchial ailments			0
delays cost studios a small fortune			0
what @entity34 saw as ‘ the sanctity of a domestic partnership ’ was thoroughly abusive , despite the romantic nonsense of telegrams , champagne and florists delivering a bouquet of roses twice a day when he was trying to patch things up			2
@entity6 in her prime ( left ) and @entity34 's first wife , actress @entity242 ( right ) his cycles of jealous paranoia and possessiveness did n’t stop when they got divorced after only 286 days , in october 1954			1
