some of the @entity1 ’s most notorious terrorists have become multi-millionaires by flooding mainland @entity3 with illegal cigarettes			1
fifteen years after the @entity8 paved the way for their release from prison , terrorists who once plotted carnage in the @entity3 are supplying tens of millions of cheaply made and potentially lethal cigarettes on the black market			2
the cigarettes originate from the @entity15 and are made of second - hand tobacco and even waste			2
under investigation : @entity18 , 48 , previously named as a member of the @entity1 ’s ruling @entity20 , is believed to be involved in the racket alongside convicted terrorist and cigarette smuggler @entity22 , 57 they are packaged as recognised brands and sold at a cheaper price – depriving the taxman of billions of pounds in lost revenue			1
details of the racket – which helps fund terrorism – emerged as a watchdog report said @entity32 had failed to meet any of its targets on reducing the smuggling of illicit tobacco into the @entity3			1
@entity37 and @entity38 officers in @entity39 told the @entity40 that leading figures in the dissident republican terror group the @entity1 are being investigated on suspicion of masterminding a global smuggling operation in cigarettes			1
they said that between 150million and 200million of its smuggled cigarettes end up in @entity3 each year , generating annual profits of up to £ 80million			2
fake cigarettes : suppliers in @entity51 employ ¿ workers ¿ to collect cigarette butts from rubbish bins and recycle the contents into new cigarettes @entity32 estimates that in 2010 - 11 alone , duty was not paid on 9 per cent of cigarettes and 38 per cent of hand - rolling tobacco smoked in the @entity3 at a cost of £ 1.9billion in lost taxes			1
industry sources say the lost revenue for 2012 will be up to £ 1billion more ( £ 2.9billion ) , after accountants @entity64 said there was a 63 per cent increase in the illicit cigarette trade last year			2
suppliers in @entity51 employ ‘ workers ’ to collect cigarette butts from rubbish bins and recycle the contents into cigarettes for export through @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
from there they find their way to @entity80 or @entity81 and then on to @entity39 and the @entity3			1
they are sold by unscrupulous newsagents and on the streets throughout the @entity3			0
the man who is being investigated over masterminding the cigarette smuggling is @entity18 , 48 , previously named as a member of the @entity1 ’s ruling @entity20			1
he was jailed for 25 years in 1995 for possession of explosives			0
senior law enforcement sources say they are considering intelligence that @entity18 , once a commander of the @entity1 ’s notorious @entity92 , runs the operation with a convicted terrorist and cigarette smuggler called @entity22 , 57			1
both men deny the allegations			0
in january , @entity18 admitted more than £ 250,000 of mortgage fraud at @entity99			0
but controversially , he was given a two - year suspended prison sentence after being deemed not to be a threat to the public			0
terrorist grew got 15 years in the mid- 1980s for a landmine attack on loyalists			2

probe : @entity109 told the @entity40 that leading figures in the dissident republican terror group the @entity1 are being investigated on suspicion of masterminding a global smuggling operation in cigarettes last month @entity114 blocked attempts to have all cigarettes in @entity3 sold in plain packets partly because it would further enrich republican terrorists			1
but despite the pm ’s decision , new @entity121 laws , which @entity3 will be forced to adopt , could make @entity1 smugglers like @entity22 even richer and cost taxpayers billions more every year			1
the @entity126 , which is currently being pushed through the @entity127 , will mean all cigarettes in @entity74 being sold in identical plain packaging and will ban menthol cigarettes completely			0
@entity3 will be forced to adopt the @entity131 or face huge rolling fines from @entity133 for not implementing it			0
‘ these new laws are a fundraising charter for dissident republicans , ’ said a security source who has spent his career battling the @entity1			1
‘ banning these products will give smugglers a huge and instant increase in the size of their black market at the expense of ordinary @entity3 taxpayers			0
’ ex @entity148 deputy chief constable @entity147 told the @entity40 : ‘ cigarette smuggling is almost a @entity151 crime			2
there are few law enforcement agencies really focusing on it			0
the profits can be higher than drug smuggling and the penalties are far smaller			1
‘ @entity158 cigarettes are often made in unhygienic underground factories where they can be contaminated with anything from rat droppings to polonium			2
‘ on every level this is a crime that damages the public purse , funds terrorism and crime and damages health			0
’ @entity171 in @entity172 is thought to be one of the worst places for selling illicit cigarettes			0
a @entity177 survey found more than 50 per cent of empty packets – which came from @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 – were either smuggled or fake .			0

the illicit smokes are believed to be made in @entity51 from recycled stubs

it is *feared* that profits from the smuggling are funding terrorist groups
