by @entity0 they never demand pay rises , complain about their managers or behave badly off the pitch			0
and while they may not have the charisma of @entity8 or the speed of @entity10 , these robots certainly have some skill			0
now students in @entity13 are planning to show just what robo - football players can do by pitting them against each in one of the biggest ever demonstrations of robotic footballing talent			0
the robot football players are all models called ' @entity32 ' created by @entity33 firm @entity32			0
when playing together , the robots must act autonomously and are unable to get help from their handlers			1
instead , they communicate via wi - fi to co-ordinate teamwork			0

the competition aims to encourage innovation in robot building by getting engineers to tackle the problems that playing football entails			0
the robots must act autonomously and can communicate via @entity78 , over 950 participants from 12 countries are participating in the three - day tournaments that compete in a variety of disciplines , which include rescue and dance			1
but by far the most popular competition is the football which was set up with the aim of creating a team of humanoid robots by 2050			1
robotics researchers believe that within 40 years a robotic football team will take to the field that will be able to defeat the current human world champions			2
participants check robots at the 2014 @entity26 tournament			2
the robots , which are models called @entity32 , are manufactured by @entity32 according to the @entity97 website , the event 's aim is to advance the ' @entity98 ' in artificial intelligence robotics researchers believe that within 40 years a robotic football team will take to the field that will be able to defeat the current human world champions according to the @entity97 website , the event 's aim is to advance the ' @entity98 ' in artificial intelligence			1
for robots to play football , various technologies have to be developed including artificial intelligence so the robots know who to pass to and how best to defeat an opponent as well as sophisticated robotics and sensors			0
after @entity26 is over , the technologies developed for scoring winning goals is transferred to a several more useful applications such as developing robots that can be used in search and rescue			2

@entity26 was set up with the aim of creating a team of humanoid robots that can take on and beat the best human players by 2050
the robots must act autonomously and can communicate via @entity78
the event is taking place in @entity29 from the 2nd until the 5th of april
