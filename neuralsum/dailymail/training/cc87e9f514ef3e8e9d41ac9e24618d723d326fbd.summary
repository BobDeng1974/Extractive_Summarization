they are @entity1 ’s heroes : servicemen and women injured in the line of duty			1
and 130 of them are in the @entity8 military team at the inaugural @entity9 — the brainchild of @entity1			1
they will compete in @entity12 this week against wounded personnel from 13 other nations			1
here , five of them share their stories with @entity18			1
my arm was sewn into my stomach @entity22 , 26 , was serving in @entity23 as a @entity24 when he was injured by an improvised explosive device ( @entity26 ) in may 2011			1
he lives in @entity27 with fiancée @entity28 , 27 , and will compete in a cycling event in the @entity9			1
@entity30 says : ‘ when i woke in hospital in @entity33 ten days after the attack the problem was that while i was intact , nothing worked : the blast crushed my face , broke my neck , injured both legs and smashed my arms to pieces			1
they cut open his abdomen and folded the loose flap of skin over his arm before sewing it in place inside			1
‘ it was like a sling created out of my own skin , ’ @entity30 explains			1
the damaged arm remained there for six weeks , attached to the blood supply of the abdomen			1
‘ over the weeks they cut small sections of the flap away and each time , my body learned to pump more blood directly into my arm , and a bit less to it through my abdomen			1
at the end of it , they separated them completely , and the wound on my arm is covered with skin from my abdomen			1
’ i lost three limbs but cycled to @entity82 @entity83 , 28 , @entity85 ( rtd ) 9 @entity86 , @entity87 lost his legs and his right arm when he stepped on an ied in @entity23			1
he lives in @entity90 with girlfriend @entity91 , 27			2
he says : ‘ i ’d done three tours to @entity23 when i stepped on an ied on @entity93 2010			2
one minute i was on the floor , the next i was in a ditch , but it was n’t until the lads started applying tourniquets that i realised i ’d been injured			1
@entity83 , 28 , @entity85 ( rtd ) 9 @entity86 , @entity87 , lost his legs and his right arm when he stepped on an ied in @entity23 ‘ i lost three limbs , but from the start i knew acceptance was the key to moving forward			2
@entity103 and you have to make the best of it			2
i spent the first year adapting to what had happened , but by last year i knew i needed something else — the question , with my injuries , was what ? ‘ then i discovered cycling			2
six weeks after i first got on a bike i cycled from @entity12 to @entity82 for @entity114			1
being part of a team was the best part — it replaces some of what you lose when you leave the @entity119			1
‘ now i ’m training to be a @entity121 cyclist and i see a wheelchair as a set of handcuffs			2
’ i 'm back to being the man i used to be @entity126 , 41 , @entity127 , @entity87			2
a reservist , @entity126 lost his left leg after being hit by an @entity26 on his second tour of @entity23 in 2010			2
he lives in @entity131 with his fiancée , @entity133 , 45 , and their child			2
he says : ‘ i had convinced my family my job was one of the safest — i was n’t poking about looking for ieds but making tactical decisions about the best way to move our men			1
but it still took me out into the field and i was unlucky			2
@entity126 , 41 , @entity127 , @entity87			2
a reservist , @entity126 lost his left leg after being hit by an @entity26 on his second tour of @entity23 in 2010 ‘ coming round in hospital was a culture shock			0
i loved skiing , riding my motorbike , and you think all this stuff has been ripped away from you			0
i remember taking a shower and looking in a mirror for the first time at where my leg had been and there were a couple of tears			0
after that , though , i just got on with it — my fiancée was seven months pregnant and we had a baby to think of			0
‘ now i ’m part of the cycling team for the @entity9 and i ’m part of the @entity166			1
it ’s helped take me back to the person i was before			0
’ the doctors thought i was dead @entity171 , 39 , @entity173 2nd @entity172 , became only the second soldier to lose both his legs in @entity23 when his vehicle detonated an ied in july 2007			0
originally from @entity177 , he remains in the @entity119 as part of their @entity179 and lives in @entity181 with wife @entity91 , 23 , and their two children			0
@entity171 says : ‘ after the explosion i looked down and saw i was lying in a pool of blood with both my legs gone			0
i thought i would go home in a coffin — and i nearly did			0
@entity171 , 39 , @entity173 2nd @entity172 , became only the second soldier to lose both his legs in @entity23 when his vehicle detonated an ied in july 2007 ‘ i was pronounced dead at the hospital in @entity191 , until one doctor detected a tiny pulse			0
somehow , i got a second chance			0
‘ it took me a while to accept i had lost my legs			0
back in 2007 my injury was rare : there was no road map , no one to inspire me			0
‘ watching the @entity201 in 2008 was a turning point			0
i realised i , too , could be an elite sportsman if i found the right discipline			0
i bought a discus , trained myself in the back garden and four years later i represented our country at @entity12 ’s 2012 paralympics			1
‘ the pride you feel is immense , and i believe it will be similar at the @entity9			1
’ this shows there 's life after injury @entity216 , 29 , @entity218 ( rtd ) @entity219 , lost his legs and an index finger in may 2010 after stepping on an ied while on patrol in @entity224			0
he lives in @entity225 with wife @entity226 , 26 and their two children			0
@entity216 says : ‘ although what happened to me was horrendous , in some ways it was harder for my wife			0
@entity216 , 29 , @entity218 ( rtd ) @entity219 , lost his legs and an index finger in may 2010 after stepping on an ied while on patrol in @entity224 ‘ my mind had already accepted that something bad might happen , but she was back at home , four months pregnant with our first child			0
however , when our daughter came along , we were so busy there was no time to dwell on what had happened			0
‘ of course , part of me misses my old life , but sport has been a huge positive — it shows you there is life beyond injury			0
now i ride a hand - bike , powered by my arms , and play sitting volleyball			0
sometimes i miss my legs — i know i wo n’t be able to climb mountains in @entity257 again — but in a funny way what happened opened up a new world of opportunities			0
’ you can still buy tickets for the @entity9 at @entity264			1
