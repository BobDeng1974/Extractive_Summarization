by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 31 january 2013 there are n’t many people who begin their working lives with a burning desire to become a professional odour judge or a diver for golf balls			1
some might not even believe that job titles such as dinosaur duster or dog food tester have ever graced a cv			1
but an @entity13 photographer has endeavoured to bring some of the world ’s most unusual professions to our attention			1
odour judge : @entity19 , who perhaps has one of the most unusual jobs of all , spent more than ten years travelling around @entity13 tracking down professionals that the rest of us never knew existed @entity25 tester : the @entity13 photographer has endeavoured to bring some of the world ¿ s most unusual professions to our attention @entity19 , who perhaps has one of the most unusual jobs of all , spent more than ten years travelling around @entity13 tracking down professionals that the rest of us never knew existed her adventures saw her scaling @entity34 to follow a @entity36 crack - filler , as he perilously dangled over the rock face , making sure that time did n’t take its toll on four of @entity13 ’s most famous sculpted faces			1
she has huddled underneath a trailer as hundreds of cows were artificially inseminated by a more - than - willing man and watched as a museum worker painstakingly dusted dinosaur bones			0
her unusual subjects could not be further removed from her own working life as a young portrait photographer , capturing household names such as @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0
@entity53 for heights : her adventures saw her scaling @entity34 to follow a @entity36 crack - filler , as he perilously dangled over the rock face , making sure that time didn ¿ t take its toll on four of @entity60 s most famous sculpted faces @entity62 collector : one of the more unusual jobs was when she photographed a woman who collects bull 's semen for a living but in 1989 , after spotting a race - timer at the @entity69 in @entity70 , miss @entity19 became fascinated with those who leave their house every morning to thrust themselves into the most unconventional working scenarios			1
after three years of travelling and research since the inception of her idea , she had amassed 15 photographs , which she bundled into a drawer			1
the bizarre shots sat dormant for nearly five years before somebody expressed an interest and the idea for a book became a reality			2
there have now been two volumes of her images - @entity89 , released in 2002 , and 2006 ’s follow - up @entity90			0
she describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ‘ fascination with @entity13 humour ’ , which shines through in many of her photographs			1
pulling ideas from newspaper articles , magazines and talking to people about the strangest jobs they knew , she eventually built up an impressive , if baffling , portfolio			1
@entity103 : a woman 's day job is standing as still as a statue in @entity107 sparring partner : her unusual subjects could not be further removed from her own working life as a young portrait photographer , capturing household names such as @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 she found herself particularly interested in jobs involving ‘ sex reversal ’ , evidenced by the male tampon tester or female who designs men ’s underwear			2
despite spending a large part of her working life meeting people because of the strange ways they earned a living , miss @entity19 says she was struck by the ‘ normality ’ of those she met			1
while some may expect an occupation as an animal keeper at the @entity130 mansion to go hand - in - hand with unorthodoxy , miss @entity19 says : i was struck by how they were all quite normal – and all the people i met seemed to enjoy their jobs			1
’ she adds : ‘ some of them even invented their own jobs – such as the sandcastle instructor – which i found quite charming ’			2
now living in @entity142 , ‘ walking around and taking pictures of things ’ , the photographer ’s career often leant towards an unorthodox subject matter			0
she has previously undertaken projects photographing twins and octogenarians			0
clock master : making sure that this clock never loses time is this man 's job golf ball diver : she describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ' fascination with @entity13 humour ' , which shines through in many of her photographs whether dealing with notable figures such as literary giant @entity166 , or the owner of a pet cemetery , she said she was always equally inspired – driven by the lure of turning up on a job and ‘ not knowing what to expect ’			2
describing how she picked suitable subjects for her odd jobs , she says : ‘ my criteria for odd was simple : there had to be a twist of some sort			2
‘ perhaps there was a gender reversal for example , a male bra designer or a young man testing tampons			0
‘ in fact , ‘ testing ’ professions became a whole chapter			0
or perhaps the job dealt with death or a forbidden but funny subject — or maybe the job was performed by only one person on earth			0
’ her stylised shots , carrying an otherworldliness befitting her subjects , were always taken in black and white , which she describes as the ‘ colours of photography ’			0
she describes the knife - thrower ’s assistant as the ‘ strangest ’ profession , saying she ‘ just could n’t believe anyone would do that ’			0
undeterred she had a go herself , describing the experience as ‘ scary ’ , but adding the caveat : ‘ he was obviously very good			0
’ visit @entity19 's website here @entity211 : they may be older than time , but this man keeps the bones of ancient creatures shining bra designer : despite spending a large part of her working life meeting people because of the strange ways they earned a living , miss @entity19 says she was struck by the ' normality ' of those she met			2
