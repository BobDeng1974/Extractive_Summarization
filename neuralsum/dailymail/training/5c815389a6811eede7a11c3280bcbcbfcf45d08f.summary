blow : @entity2 environment minister @entity1 announced his country was withdrawing from the @entity4 last night @entity2 has abandoned the @entity4 on climate change as it bids to protect the third largest oil reserves in the world			1
environment minister @entity1 said @entity2 was invoking the legal right to withdraw and would be saving the country $ 14billion in penalties for not achieving its @entity13 targets			1
the @entity15 government is reluctant to hurt @entity2 's booming oil sands sector - which holds more than 170 billion barrels - with daily production expected to more than double by 2025			2
@entity2 becomes the first nation to formally renounce the protocol , although @entity22 and @entity23 have also indicated they would not accept new @entity13 commitments after the protocol expires at the end of 2012			1
mr @entity1 said : ' the @entity4 does not cover the world 's largest two emitters - the @entity30 and @entity31 - and therefore can not work			1
' it 's now clear that @entity13 is not the path forward to a global solution to climate change			0
if anything it 's an impediment			0
' to meet the targets under @entity13 for 2012 would be the equivalent of either removing every car , truck , @entity42 , tractor , ambulance , police car and vehicle of every kind from @entity2 roads or closing down the entire farming and agriculture sector and cutting heat to every home , office , hospital , factory and building in @entity2			1
' currently , @entity2 produces 1.5million barrels from the oil sands a day			0
only @entity59 and @entity60 have more reserves			0
critics say the enormous amount of energy and water needed in the extraction process increases greenhouse gas emissions , meaning @entity2 will only be more likely to fall foul of the carbon dioxide targets in the future			1
there is also the possibility that further global warming could make it easier to extract the oil in hard - to - access areas where the @entity78 conditions make it difficult to drill or strip out			2
@entity80 : the protocol required 37 countries to commit to reducing their greenhouse gas output to 1990 levels by the end of next year ( file picture ) mr @entity1 's announcement comes a day after marathon climate talks finished in the @entity91 city of @entity92			1
negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed on a deal that sets the world on a path to sign a new climate treaty by 2015 to replace the @entity4 , which expires at the end of next year			1
@entity2 's previous @entity100 government signed the accord , but current prime minister @entity103 's @entity15 government has never accepted it			2
the accord requires countries to give a year 's notice to withdraw			0
much heralded : then prime minister @entity107 received a standing ovation after the protocol was ratified in 2002			0
@entity13 did not include the @entity30 or @entity31 the @entity4 was signed in 1997 in @entity22 and ratified by most major countries except the @entity30 and @entity31			1
it only came into force in february , 2005			0
it committed 37 industrialised nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels and provided financial help to developing countries to accomplish the task			0
although @entity2 ratified the accord , it was not on track to meet its targets as emissions climbed while the economy expanded			2
the protocol will continue to be in effect until the end of 2012 , despite @entity2 quitting			2
while many city authorities in @entity2 approved the decision , others accused the government of destabilising future action on global warming			1
@entity137 spokesman @entity136 said in a written statement the @entity103 government ' has imposed a death sentence on many of the world 's most vulnerable populations by pulling out of @entity13 '			0
he added : ' this is a further signal that the @entity103 government is more concerned about protecting polluters than people			0
' @entity148 environment critic @entity147 said the costs for @entity2 to say in @entity150 were ' absolutely made up '			0
she told @entity151 : ' what this is really about is the fact that our government is abdicating its international obligations			1
' it 's like we 're the kid who 's failing the class so we have to drop it before that happens			0

@entity2 becomes first nation to renounce protocol against global warming
country was not on track to meet greenhouse gas targets and faced $ 14bn in penalties
@entity4 expires at the end of 2012 and new treaty is expected to be drawn up by 2015
agreement signed in 1997 did not include @entity30 or @entity31
critics accuse government of ' abdicating international obligations '
