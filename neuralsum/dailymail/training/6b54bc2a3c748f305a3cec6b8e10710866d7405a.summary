one of the two hydrogen bombs that landed when a b - 52 bomber broke up over @entity2 , @entity3 in 1961 new details have emerged about the near fatal 1961 @entity5 and how close one of the hydrogen bombs came to exploding after it crash landed			1
the b - 52 bomber broke up in the sky over @entity3 during a routine flight just three days after president @entity13 ’s inauguration on january 20			1
according to a newly declassified report published on monday by the @entity15 , one of the bombs - which landed in free - fall and without the help of its parachute - was actually in the ‘ armed ’ setting by the time it hit the ground near @entity2			1
if the shock of crash - landing had not also damaged the switch contacts , the weapon could have detonated , the report said			1
‘ the report implied that because @entity33 landed in a free - fall , without the parachute operating , the timer did not initiate the bomb ’s high voltage battery ( ‘ trajectory arming ’ ) , a step in the arming sequence , ’ wrote @entity30 of the @entity15			1
‘ for weapon 2 , the @entity42 switch was in the " safe " position , yet it was virtually armed because the impact shock had rotated the indicator drum to the " armed " position			1
but the shock also damaged the switch contacts , which had to be intact for the weapon to detonate			1
' @entity30 concluded : ‘ perhaps this is what secretary of defense @entity52 had in mind , a few years later , when he observed that , “ by the slightest margin of chance , literally the failure of two wires to cross , a nuclear explosion was averted			0
’ ” the blasts from the @entity63 bombs - each one 260 times the power of the explosive that was dropped on @entity66 , @entity67 , in the @entity68 - would have killed thousands around @entity2 and much further afield the @entity69 received widespread attention last year , when new details were published in a book , @entity73 : nuclear weapons , @entity75 , and @entity76 , by @entity77			1
it included maps - engineered by @entity81 historian @entity80 - which showed how millions of @entity83 could have been affected by the massive nuclear blast with the fallout stretching as far as @entity86			1
the blasts from the @entity63 bombs - each one 260 times the power of the explosive that was dropped on @entity66 , @entity67 , in the @entity68 - would have killed thousands around @entity2			1
however , fallout calculations show that radiation could have spread all along the @entity92 - from @entity93 , to @entity94 , @entity95 and even @entity86 - if the wind was blowing in the wrong direction			1
devastation : this is the theoretical fallout of the detonation of 8 megatons of nuclear weapons - the combined power of the two hydrogen bombs that fell into @entity3 fields in 1961 total loss : @entity106 thousands of people would have died if even one of the bombs had gone off may 22nd , 1957 : @entity110 , @entity111 a cow was killed and residents of @entity114 terrified when a b - 36 aircraft transporting a nuclear bomb from @entity117 to @entity111 fell through the bomb bay doors from 1,700 feet and detonated , blasting a crater 12 feet deep and 25 feet across			1
luckily the nuclear capsule had separated from the bomb and did not explode.february 5th , 1958 : @entity122 , @entity123 a @entity124 carrying a nuclear bomb collided midair with an f - 86 jet during a training flight			2
the device was jettisoned and fell into the the river and has never been @entity131 14th , 1961 : @entity132 , @entity133 a crippled @entity134 carrying a pair of nuclear bombs suffered a loss of pressure at 10,000 feet			2
the commander stayed aboard to pilot the plane away from @entity132 in @entity133 before ejecting at 4,000 feet			0
the plane crashed but nothing detonated and the bombs were recovered.january 17th , 1966 : @entity144 , @entity145 a @entity134 carrying four hydrogen bombs blew up during an airborne refuel			1
both planes and seven of the 11 crew members died in the explosion and all of the nuclear devices fell to the ground			0
two exploded on impact near to @entity144 and contaminated one square mile with plutonium			0
another was recovered from a riverbed and the other fell into the @entity160			0
a local fisherman saw the bomb fall and claimed salvage rights of 1 percent of the nuclear weapons $ 2 billion value			0
the @entity166 settled out of court			0
the information made available last year also revealed how the safeties on the second bomb , which landed near @entity171 , failed - all except for one			2
the bomb ’s parachute deployed – the first step toward detonation			2
soon its trigger mechanisms engaged , the bomb was ready to blow			0
‘ @entity166 experts … found that five of the six interlocks had been set off by the fall , ’ dr @entity179 wrote			0
with millions of lives on the line , the last line of defense held up – a low voltage switch			2
‘ only a single switch prevented the 24 megaton bomb from detonating and spreading fire and destruction over a wide area , ’ dr @entity179 wrote			2
‘ it would have been bad news in spades , ’ he further exclaimed			0
despite blasting dr @entity179 ’s report for lacking ‘ objectivity and accuracy , ’ a @entity202 national laboratories engineer ( according to the @entity203 ) agreed with the main point			0
‘ one simple , dynamo technology , low - voltage switch stood between the @entity83 and a major catastrophe ! ’ the engineer wrote in an added evaluation			1
@entity202 was responsible for the mechanical safety of the bombs			0
even worse , as the bomb dropped and the detonation sequence carried out , three of the four safety mechanisms failed , resulting in a firing signal being sent to the bomb 's nuclear core when it hit the ground			1
' the @entity223 @entity222 bomb did not possess adequate safety for the airborne alert role in the @entity134 , ' the engineer concluded			0
@entity77 discovered at least 700 significant accidents in incidents involving the country 's nuclear arsenal between 1950 and 1968			0
' the @entity83 government has consistently tried to withhold information from the @entity83 people in order to prevent questions being asked about our nuclear weapons policy , ' he said			0
' we were told there was no possibility of these weapons accidentally detonating , yet here 's one that very nearly did , ' he added			0
20 jan 1961 , @entity93 , @entity83 --- president @entity13 making his inauguration speech from the balcony of the @entity245 in @entity93 , @entity93			2

two hydrogen bombs were dropped after a b - 52 bomber broke up in *mid-air* above @entity3 in 1961
according to a newly declassified report , one of the bombs was actually in the ' armed ' setting by the time it hit the ground
if the shock of crash - landing had not also damaged the switch contacts , the weapon could have detonated
the other bomb went through almost every single stage of the detonation sequence , before failing to detonate
maps released last year showed how millions of @entity83 could have been affected with the fallout stretching as far as @entity86
