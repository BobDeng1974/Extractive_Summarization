a leading @entity1 mp has voiced his anger as a crushed commuter on @entity5 ’s ‘ @entity4			1
’ he said rail company @entity6 was treating its customers like ‘ a cash cow ’ while forcing them to endure misery in overcrowded conditions that would provoke prosecutions if livestock were treated so badly			1
rising star @entity14 and @entity0 mp @entity15 said that like many of his constituents , he had the misfortune to be crammed into the most overcrowded commuter train in @entity5 – the 7.32am @entity21 trains service from @entity22 to @entity23			1
@entity1 mp @entity15 spoke out about the overcrowded commuting conditions on @entity6 during the debate in @entity26 , @entity15 pointed out that conditions were ' one grade below cattle class ' he told transport minister @entity30 : ‘ it ’s little wonder the @entity33 dubbed the service the @entity4			1
’ speaking during a debate which he instigated in the @entity36 ’ @entity26 he noted : ‘ @entity38 rules stipulate that calves , adult goats and unshorn sheep must be transported by train in an area of space of at least 0.3 metres squared per unit of livestock			2
‘ yet , the new government standard for commissioning commuter services for humans is now 0.25 metres squared , significantly less			2
‘ i understand that the only train company currently operating to that standard is - you guessed it - @entity6 ’			1
he said he and his overcrowded constituents were paying soaring fares and massive subsidies to improve other rail services across the @entity5 ‘ for the privilege of travelling at one grade below cattle class on @entity6 ’			1
@entity6 customers ‘ feel quite literally as if they are treated like a cash cow , despite travelling in sub-cattle class conditions , ’ he said			1
but while his words of woe will resonate with millions of commuters the length and breadth of @entity5 , they are likely to be met with dismay by transport ministers			2
@entity23 is the final stop for @entity5 's most overcrowded commuter train : the @entity22 to @entity23 route mr @entity15 , a judo black belt who boards at @entity14 station in @entity81 said : ‘ i know first - hand how packed the carriages are			1
occasionally , it ’s impossible even to get on the train			0
’ he said the service had become even worse since last year : ‘ i say this not just from the clear data available , but also as a commuting mp			2
' he said : ‘ i stand on the platform with my constituent paying an ever - increasing fare both for the train service and the parking at the station			2
‘ and together we have experienced the steadily increasing overcrowding of a prime commuter route			0
’ mr @entity15 said he was ‘ not surprised ’ to learn that 2013 data from the @entity96 had pinpointed his regular service – the 7.32am train from @entity22 to @entity23 train – as having ‘ the largest number of passengers in excess of capacity ’ , rail industry jargon for ‘ most overcrowded			1
’ he said : ‘ by the time it arrives at @entity14 at 7.52am , it ’s packed to the gunnels			0
’ official data showed it has 540 passengers over its specified maximum capacity limit – or 73 per cent over its official capacity ceiling			0
@entity15 opened up discussion about the high fares and poor service that his constituents must endure he noted : ‘ the 7.32 has consistently appeared in the top 10 overcrowded peak services in recent years			1
nor is it a freak time … for example , the 7.02am service is almost as packed			0
‘ he said @entity81 commuters were particularly hard - hit with high fares and poor service			2
in his own @entity125 borough alone - dubbed the ‘ @entity126 for the high concentation of celebrities and premiership football players - nearly 12 million people using the stations			0
recorded journeys have almost doubled between 2002 and 2010			0
a season ticket for the 25 minute journey from @entity14 to @entity23 currently costs just under £ 2,000 , he said , noting : ‘ fares will rise by 3 % again in the @entity136			2
’ @entity138 ‘ sardine ’ commuters are also subsiding services elsewhere , contributing £ 6billion to the @entity141 but getting back less than £ 1billion in services			0
in 2013/14 , @entity6 passengers paid @entity144 the highest premium for their rail service - 5.2 pence per passenger per kilometre			1
by contrast some 13.1 pence subsidy ‘ doled out ’ by the government to @entity151 , while @entity152 received 2.8p and @entity153			0
in the four years to 2013/14 , @entity6 passengers had ‘ coughed up the largest subsidy to government coffers of any train company ’ totalling just over £ 1 billion			1
although this was ‘ a truly staggering amount ’ it appeared ‘ quite arbitrary no - one could explain to him how it was calculated			0
' @entity6 passengers recently ranked their service 3rd worst in the country in terms of value for money			2
only 37 per cent thought they were getting value for money compared to 78 per cent of @entity169 passengers and 61 % of @entity171 passengers , he said			0
excuses from @entity6 might be ‘ easier to swallow ’ if director remuneration at parent company @entity174 ‘ doubled between 2010 and 2014 , ’ he said			1
nicknamed the ' @entity4 , ' @entity15 urged transport minister @entity30 to acknowledge the line 's falws he told ministers that during the pressing financial crisis his constituents have ‘ rather stoically endured ’ the immediate frustration of high fares and acute overcrowding : ‘ but , when i stand on that platform , with my fellow constituents taking the @entity4 up to @entity23 , i need to be able to explain how we are going to address the conditions of travel , which are often cramped and uncomfortable , over the long term			1
‘ i need to explain how we are going to deliver better value for money and to give them some light at the end of the tunnel			0
’ transport minister mrs @entity30 said she had first - hand experience of the crush ‘ @entity4 ’ having travelled on it during a ‘ mystery shopping exercise ’ on a day when four carriages had been removed			0
she said overcrowding was ‘ perversely a measure of success ’ because more people were using the railways			0
but she acknowledged the @entity21 franchise , drawn up under labour , was flawed .			0
