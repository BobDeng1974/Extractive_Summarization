for many of us , a few simple images of our last holiday will suffice as mementos			0
perhaps we take a few quick snaps on our camera - phone and upload them to @entity7 , perhaps we make a short video to capture a special moment – or perhaps we reel off an enormous range of photos , then leave them to capture digital dust on a memory card			0
standing at the edge of @entity16 : ' @entity17 ' visits the @entity16 's southernmost point at @entity19 but for one particular tourist on a sight - seeing mission around the @entity16 , such little travel fragments are not enough			1
identified as ‘ @entity17 ’ , this young trail - blazer has spent considerable time and effort on visiting all 50 states of the @entity16 – and proving his arrival by standing in front of a recognisable landmark or backdrop , and filming a short burst of footage that captures him waving the @entity16 flag with a broad grin on his face			1

a less known corner of the country : another day , another state - this time @entity68 heading deep into the country : now it 's a foray into the @entity71 , and @entity72 the @entity59 leg of the odyssey was clearly the most demanding , the footage showing ‘ @entity17 ’ grimacing in sub-zero temperatures as snow billows around him			1
although the extent of his travels is apparent , he gives away little about himself except to reveal that he hails from @entity81			0
‘ the stars at night are big and bright , deep in the heart of @entity81 ! ’ he says of his home patch – before adding : ‘ but i love all the states			2
