she blames @entity6 , @entity7 's half - sister peace activist and @entity9 convert @entity6 has been branded a home - wrecker by the woman who is still married to her new husband , @entity12			1
@entity2 has fled her home in @entity4 , @entity14 , and taken her three children to her brother ’s house in @entity18 to recover from the collapse of her 16 - year marriage			1
the 37 - year - old childminder and bilingual teaching assistant claims that ms @entity6 – the half - sister of @entity7 – has betrayed her newly acquired @entity9 faith			1
she accuses her of openly flirting with @entity12 in front of her , spending the family celebrations of @entity27 and @entity28 with him , and marrying him in secret			2
speaking from the house in a gated community where she has taken refuge , mrs @entity2 said : ‘ @entity6 destroyed my home			1
you ca n’t just put on a hijab and say you are a good @entity9 woman – it ’s about having boundaries with men , and love and respect for women			1
‘ she came into my house as my and my husband ’s guest and did this under my nose			1
her behaviour appals me , and other @entity9 women – the very people she professes to support – must now judge her			1
’ her words are a major rebuke to ms @entity6 , 45 , whose @entity53 announcement of her marriage was revealed by @entity55 last week			2
it followed a jokey advert placed on the social networking site last year saying she was hunting for a husband , and that ‘ @entity61 agents , secret drinkers , @entity64 stooges , men who do n’t pray and men who do n’t pay ’ need not apply			2
last night mrs @entity2 told how her marriage to @entity68 , 49 , faltered as he devoted increasing amounts of time to promoting @entity9 charity and fundraising events involving ms @entity6			1
she knew they were business associates and @entity12 described ms @entity6 as his ‘ sister ’ – a @entity9 term of respect			1
mrs @entity2 first met ms @entity6 , who is now recognised across the @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80 as a public speaker , when she came to stay at the @entity83 home in march 2012			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i cooked for her and then i stayed at home with the children while my husband and @entity6 went out together			1
they came home late and i saw how open she was with him ‘ she was joking around doing silly accents , @entity90 and @entity79			2
it was funny , but in the presence of a supposedly strange man , it was wrong			2
‘ this is not the way @entity97 tells a woman to be			2
usually reverts [ as @entity9 converts are called ] are even more strict and zealous			1
they see @entity97 in black and white , unlike those of us who are born to it			0
’ @entity2 with her husband of 16 years @entity12 and their two children in 1994 later that evening , after demanding that her husband come upstairs to bed , mrs @entity2 claims she was shocked to see him emerging from ms @entity6 ’s room			1
‘ he said he ’d just popped in to collect something and brushed aside my suspicions but i was shocked and furious with him , ’ she said			0
‘ they looked like more than friends or business associates			0
i told @entity12 that even though i knew he was not going to stop seeing her , she was not allowed back into my house			2
@entity9 convert : @entity6 married @entity12 after coming to stay at the @entity83 home in 2012 ' he started going away on business for three and four days at a time , and sometimes being in @entity122 at weekends			1
’ in april 2012 , @entity12 launched the @entity124 fundraising charity peace 2012 , and signed up ms @entity6 as a co-director two weeks later			0
the charity is registered to his parents ’ home in @entity4 and its stated aim is to provide food , water , houses and power to @entity124 ’s deprived areas			1
mrs @entity2 continued : ‘ @entity27 was in august and i expected us all to be together , but @entity6 was in @entity14			1
@entity12 wanted her to stay with us and i said no way			0
‘ he responded by staying out almost all night with her , coming back perhaps at 1am and leaving again at 2.30am			0
i asked him what kind of charity fundraising went on at these times			0
‘ he ate his sehri [ the pre-dawn meal ] and his iftar [ the meal which breaks the daily fast of @entity27 ] with @entity6 , which felt like he was spurning his real family			0
‘ on @entity145 , @entity6 arrived home from the mosque with @entity12 and other family members but no one warned me			2
i walked out of my kitchen and she was there in my front room in full make - up , dressed from head - to - toe in red , the traditional colour of a @entity9 wedding dress			1
she looked like a bride			0
‘ she followed me back into the kitchen and said , “ i am sorry i stole your husband ! ” she meant the time she ’d spent with him over @entity27 but i told her flatly that i missed him and did not approve			0
later he spent all his time attending to her and they went off into the night			0
none of his family members said anything to him			0
’ ms @entity6 later wed @entity12 in a secret nikah , or religious ceremony			0
such a ceremony is significant in faith terms but is not recognised as legal in @entity175 unless it takes place in another country where it is considered a legal way to marry			2
technically , @entity12 ’s faith permits him to take up to four wives but it is becoming more culturally acceptable to have just one			2
islamic law states a first wife should be informed about subsequent unions and while she can not object , she should be given the opportunity to ask for a divorce			0
