by @entity0 published : 12:40 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 07:16 est , 17 june 2013 the annual alcohol - fuelled suicide sunday celebrations marking the end of @entity5 's exam season got off to their customary raucous start with a cardboard boat race			1
in a parody of the more sober @entity11 and @entity12 boat race on the @entity13 , students took to their makeshift vessels to row down the @entity15			1
famed for being a day of carousing and drunken antics , the undergraduates stripped down to shorts and bikinis for a splash about on the @entity15			1
after some @entity39 courage , they then raced along the historic backs for half a mile from @entity56 to @entity57 as spectators cheered the wobbly vessels on from the tow path			2
some were forced to bail out straight away as their soggy creations dissolved around them , but a few better - built rafts survived until the end of the course			1
more than 30 teams competed , some vessels managing to only carry three people but a sturdy raft managed to accommodate 10 people as it whistled past a wooden punt full of tourists			2
one student , who did not want to be named , rejected the claims that they were behaving disrespectfully to other people who live in the town			0
students making some last minute design decisions to help their chances in the race the proud creators of a boat , inexplicably holding a @entity85 poster , show off their secret rowing weapon - a racket covered in sellotape @entity89 ensued at the crowded starting line when the students began paddling frantically with an assortment of trays and plastic box lids many flimsy vessels disintegrated in seconds , leaving students scurrying for the banks comforted by a few cans of beer , two sodden teammates paddled to the side of the @entity15 to make their inglorious exit the 28 - year - old , who studied history , said : ' i think its all just a bit of fun really			1
' if we were throwing up on the streets it would different but everyone is in good spirits			0
' the boat race was among a number of parties taking place in @entity12 today to mark the beginning of @entity120 , in which students attend daily balls and garden parties to end the academic year on a high			1
elsewhere in town , a garden party in @entity125 saw some students eating their own ties as part of an unusual initiation ceremony			2
other students watched on as they drank gin , vodka and @entity134 's in the gardens of the famous college			1
most were on their best behaviour after being told by one of their directors of studies , dr @entity137 , that boisterous behaviour would see them disciplined by the university			0
a spokesman for the @entity5 also advised students to be careful after trouble in previous years			0
the spokesman said : ' students are frequently advised by their colleges to look after themselves , their friends and their valuables when out socialising			0
looking chilly but confident the big team with an elaborate raft psyched themselves up for the race ahead the raft went cruising past some bemused tourists relaxing on a traditional punt the raft was suddenly overtaken by a more compact design , as both teams were watched by tourists who happened to be punting during the chaotic race students lined the banks to cheer on their brave friends in the cold water they celebrated their surprising arrival at the end of the race by hugging each other and jumping in the river this intrepid team waded out to dry off and carry on their revelries on solid ground the day of drinking came a month after 2,000 @entity12 students took part in @entity177 sunday - a similar event celebrating the end of term			1
hundreds of students also attended the annual party at @entity183 in a seventeenth century manor house in the sleepy @entity186 village of @entity187			0
the exclusive party was organised three miles from the university by the @entity191 ' drinking society			0
the garden party , which has a bikini dress code for girls and blazers and shorts for boys , involved downing excessive amounts of alcohol and riotous drinking games			0
the annual jelly wrestling contest , which usually sees two girls in bikinis wrestling in a pool of jelly , was cancelled this year following a petition saying it was ' sexist '			0
jubilant scenes awaited the winners who miraculously managed to row through the entire 500 metres this team 's effort looked surprisingly sturdy , still largely in tact after its difficult journey down the @entity15 the clear up operation begins as binmen collected up the soggy cardboard this afternoon four years ago the party had to be held in a new location for the first time in 80 years after officials banned students from holding the event on university land			1
the controversial decision was made after a 23 - year - old student was arrested during the infamous jelly wrestling contest in which bikini - clad students battle it out for a Â£ 250 prize , when she punched a spectator			2
the drinking society is based at @entity232 , whose former alumni include @entity236 writer @entity235 , diarist @entity237 , @entity239 editor @entity238 , and journalist @entity240 .			0

@entity120 marks the end of @entity12 's *grueling* exam season
*overjoyed* students relaxed with a drunken cardboard boat race on the @entity15
a surprising number of soggy vessels survived the 500 - metre journey
