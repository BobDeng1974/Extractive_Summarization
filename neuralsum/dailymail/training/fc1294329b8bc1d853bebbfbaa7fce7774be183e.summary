by @entity0 last updated at 8:44 am on 19th december 2011 could life actually survive in the hostile , freezing conditions on @entity4 ? a team of scientists from @entity7 have collected microbes from an icy ' lava tube ' in mountains in @entity12 - similarly hostile to the @entity4 's surface - and found common microbes thriving			1
the microbes ' lived ' on iron from a mineral found in rocks - a mineral , olivine , also found in volcanic rocks on @entity4 , and could survive low oxygen conditions and the total absence of organic food			1
@entity23 on @entity4 , the largest volcano in the solar system : volcanic rock - olivine - which is found on @entity4 formed the ' food ' for the bacteria living in mountains in @entity7 ‘ this microbe is from one of the most common families of bacteria found on @entity39 , ’ said @entity30 , a doctoral student at @entity31 and one of the authors of the study			1
‘ you can find its cousins in caves , on your skin , at the bottom of the ocean and just about anywhere			0
what is different , in this case , is its unique qualities that allow it to grow in @entity4 - like conditions			1
’ the scientists proved that that microbes have adapted to deal with their harsh living conditions			0
in a normal , room - temperature settings , with normal oxygen levels , the bacteria eat organic materials such as sugar			1
but the scientists removed the food , turned down the temperature to near - freezing and lowered the oxygen , they turned to the food they survive on in the lava tubes - olivine , a common mineral found in volcanic rocks on @entity39 and on @entity4 – as its energy source			1
‘ this reaction - where microbes ' feed ' on a common mineral from volcanic rocks - just has n’t been documented before , ’ said @entity71 , a professor in @entity31 ’s @entity31 and an author on the study			0
lava tubes in @entity7 : scientists found that icy lava tubes in the high mountains played host to bacteria that thrived in icy , oxygen - poor environments and lived on iron rather than normal ' food ' ‘ in volcanic rocks directly exposed to air and at warmer temperatures , the oxygen in the atmosphere oxidizes the iron before the microbes can use it			1
but in the lava tube , where the bacteria are covered in ice and thus sheltered from the atmosphere , they out - compete the oxygen for the iron			2
the microbes were collected from a lava tube near @entity103 in @entity7 ’s @entity104 , at an elevation of about 5,000 feet			2
they were within the ice on rocks some 100 feet inside the lava tube , in a low - oxygen , near - freezing environment			2
scientists , including @entity71 , have said that the subsurface of @entity4 could have similar conditions and harbor bacteria			2
in fact , @entity71 has examined a meteorite originating from @entity4 that contained tracks – which could indicate consumption by microbes – though no living material was discovered			2
similar tracks were found on the rocks from the @entity103 lava tube , he said			0
' conditions in the lava tube are not as harsh as on @entity4 , ’ @entity71 said			0
‘ on @entity4 , temperatures rarely get to the freezing point , oxygen levels are lower and at the surface , liquid water is not present			0
but water is hypothesized to be present in the warmer subsurface of @entity4			0
although this study does not exactly duplicate what you would find on @entity4 , it does show that bacteria can live in similar conditions			1
‘ we know from direct examination , as well as satellite imagery , that olivine is in @entity4 rocks , ’ @entity71 added			0
‘ and now we know that olivine can sustain microbial life			0

bacteria survive 5,000 feet up and 100ft below ground
@entity150 , oxygen - poor conditions ' like @entity4 '
live on ' olivine ' - an iron - rich mineral found on @entity4
need no organic material to survive
