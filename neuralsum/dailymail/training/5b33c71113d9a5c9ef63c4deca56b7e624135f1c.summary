@entity0 is being sued over claims it has been scanning users ’ private messages for personal information to sell to advertisers			1

@entity0 is accused of monitoring users ' private messages to one another to glean personal information that can be sold on to advertising companies it is thought the information is particularly valuable because people are more likely to reveal their true interests in messages they think are private			1
the alleged breach of privacy has been exposed by internet experts , who examined whether messages that @entity0 insists are private were actually being monitored			1
the claim relates to messages sent directly to a friend ’s inbox , rather than posted on a profile wall , which can be seen publicly			0
many people use private messages to send friends links to other websites , such as news articles , shopping sites or sports blogs			2
@entity0 apparently tracked such messages so they could collect data on the interests of people who use the site			1
advertising agencies and marketing companies are then allegedly sold this information so they can build up profiles of a person ’s interests , and target them accordingly			1
if the linked webpage contains a ‘ like ’ button , @entity0 will activate this so any company who has been ‘ liked ’ will see the person is interested in their products			2
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit			0
the allegations have been made in a @entity72 lawsuit taken out by @entity73 , from @entity74 , and @entity75 , from @entity76			0
@entity63 and @entity64 ( former ceo @entity77 pictured right ) are among six companies facing accusations of intercepting communications for profit they are seeking compensation of either $ 100 ( £ 60 ) for each day the practice has gone on , or $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) for each of the @entity72 users who have had messages intercepted			0
they claim @entity0 ’s breach of privacy violates the @entity89 and @entity91 privacy and unfair competition laws			2
while the case only covers users in @entity72 , it is believed @entity0 members all over the world will have been affected			2
@entity99 information security firm @entity98 researched their claims by sending links through the private messaging services of 50 social media sites , and experts checked to see which of these were then clicked on by the sites – showing they had been tracked			1
but computer expert @entity106 said : ‘ i do n’t see anything necessarily wrong in principle with online services automatically scanning messages between individuals , and examining the links that they are sharing			0
‘ if @entity0 ’s security team did n’t have such systems in place i would believe them to be disturbingly lax in their duty of care for users			0
’ a @entity0 spokesman added : ‘ we believe the allegations are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously			1
’ the site has previously paid $ 20million ( £ 12million ) to members who claimed in 2011 that it had used their data without their consent .			0
