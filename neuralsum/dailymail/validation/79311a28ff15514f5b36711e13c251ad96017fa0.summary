they are seeking any and all records related to @entity5 and @entity99 , the pseudonym @entity5 used to check into the hotel			0
the documents blasted the arrest , which the attorneys say was orchestrated ' to coincide with the final episode of the @entity107 docudrama @entity108			0
the six - part documentary concluded sunday			0
@entity5 's arrest came shortly before the @entity107 finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife , who disappeared in @entity116 in 1982 ; @entity9 , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in @entity122 whose dismembered body was found floating in @entity124 in 2001			1

authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room			0
however , @entity5 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge			1

he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in @entity124			2
while legal experts said @entity5 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing			1
' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said @entity199 , a former prosecutor and professor at @entity201			0
' the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face			0
' in the case of @entity207 , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with @entity212 because it contradicted other evidence			0
