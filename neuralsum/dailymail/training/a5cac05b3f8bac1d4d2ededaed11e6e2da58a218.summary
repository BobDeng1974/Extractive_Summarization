by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 2 april 2013 a major hospital was so overrun by patients and queuing ambulances that bosses had to erect a major incident tent normally used to treat casualties after disasters such as air and rail crashes			1
up to 15 ambulances were kept waiting outside the @entity12 department at the @entity13 and @entity14 on @entity15			1
some stood more than three hours before patients were admitted			0
up to 15 ambulances were kept waiting outside the @entity12 department at the @entity13 and @entity14 on @entity15			1
a major incident tent was put up so paramedics could drop off patients the delays spanned an eight hour period with some stood more than three hours before patients were delivered the @entity13 and @entity14 was one of the first to be built under the controversial private finance initiative schemes introduced by @entity26			1
private @entity28 ( @entity25 ) hand financing of large - scale buildings or infrastructure schemes , such as new schools and hospitals , from the @entity34 to developers			0
the company owns the building and leases it back to the public sector over a period of a minimum of 25 years			0
the benefit to the public sector is that there is no up - front burden on the taxpayer and crumbling buildings can be restored or scrapped and completely re-built			0
the benefit to the private sector is that the repayment interest rates are usually high			0
some companies charge interest rates of up to 70 per cent			0
as such , many hospital trusts have struggled with the crippling annual @entity25 repayments - which run into multi-millions - at a time when the @entity56 must make savings of £ 20bn by 2015			2
in 2006 , the public accounts committee revealed that two years after @entity59 and @entity13 was completed @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 decided to refinance their joint working company , @entity64 , so that they could take early profits			1
by increasing the size of the borrowings - from £ 200m to more than £ 300m - and the time taken to repay that money from the year 2017 to 2037 , they managed to take out a windfall of £ 115m			0
it was reported they gave only £ 34m of that to the hospital trust and kept the rest for themselves			2
the situation got so bad that a major incident tent similar to a field hospital was put up so paramedics could drop off their patients			1
frustrated ambulance staff said the emergency tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes and putting it outside the hospital was ' unheard of '			1
but hospital bosses said it was only erected ' as a precaution ' for 1 hour and 45 minutes and in the end no - one had to be treated in it			0
the hospital faced a similar problem last month when all 17 ambulances were left queuing outside @entity12			1
on that occasion the @entity96 was left unable to attend 12 other 999 calls and ambulances had to be drafted in from further afield			0
the latest incident came after the hospital 's director of medicine and emergency care , @entity105 , said they should be able to cope with 15 ambulances turning up at once			1
one ambulance crewman said : ' we are so fed - up with getting slated and being made to look as if the ambulance service is to blame for the delays - but it 's not us , it 's @entity12			1
' they want to get out and save lives			0
that 's all they want to do and they are getting caught up in a political row			0
' the tent is usually used at plane crashes and big events , such as the lord mayor 's parade			1
to put it up outside the @entity12 is unheard of			1
' another ambulance worker , who also asked to remain anonymous , said : ' it 's a mini-hospital in a tent			2
' ' it will usually have in it treatment bays , drugs , oxygen , the same stuff on board an ambulance but inside a tent - which is a lot colder			2
' ambulance service spokesman @entity137 said : ' between 11am and 8pm the trust had an average of between six and 15 vehicles queuing for up to three plus hours			2
frustrated ambulance staff said the emergency tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes and putting it outside the hospital was ' unheard of ' ( stock image ) ' clearly this led to ambulances not being available to respond to other patients in the community			1
' we worked closely with the hospital and clinical commissioning group throughout the afternoon and deployed the the trust major incident tent to help release ambulances back on to the road			1
' the trust is pleased that this issue is now resolved following much hard work by the hospital and the ambulance service and that in the end no patients were required to be treated in the major incident tent at this time			1
' hospital chief executive @entity166 said : ' we were extremely busy over the weekend			0
' we made a decision with the ambulance trust to put the tent up simply as a precaution at about half - past six last night			2
' we agreed by quarter - past eight that we did n't need it			0
' the demand on emergency services over the bank holiday weekend had been exceptionally high and the ambulance tent was erected for a short period as a precautionary measure			2
' now a local mp has demanded answers from the hospital and called for an investigation to ensure patients at the hospital receive the appropriate care			0
health minister dr @entity185 , mp for @entity186 and @entity187 , said : ' this is clearly some unacceptable poor standard of care for 999 patients in @entity13 and @entity186			2
' front line paramedics are doing their best to get their patients into the care of the @entity13 & @entity59 and it seems the hospital system of triage is not up to standard			1
' it is time the hospital management learned lessons and improve triage process			0
' clearly there are very busy days but the @entity203 has a poor history on ambulances not being able to deliver 999 patients			0

up to 15 ambulances queued outside @entity12 at @entity13 and @entity59 hospital
staff said the tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes
ambulance teams said putting it outside the hospital was ' unheard of '
