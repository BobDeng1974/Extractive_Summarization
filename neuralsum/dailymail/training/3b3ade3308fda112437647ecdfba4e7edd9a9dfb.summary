the @entity0 is well and truly underway , with several players settling in to their new surroundings and impressing in the second gameweek			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were the real winners this weekend with convincing victories against @entity8 and @entity9			1
here , @entity10 crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10 @entity0 performers from saturday , sunday and monday			1
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 all make the list , but who comes out on top in our @entity20 chart ? 10			1
@entity22 , @entity23 ( @entity20 score : 34.7 ) despite @entity26 focusing in the summer on adding some much needed fire power to @entity23 's ranks , they had to rely on a defender to net their first goal of the season			1
the captain stepped up when the @entity34 needed him most , and was also dominant at the back with 12 clearances			1
it measures a player 's contribution to the success of his team			2
the intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses			2
so , what are the six indices ? 1			2
player 's performance per match 3			2
@entity38 , @entity61 ( 34.9 ) another @entity0 game , another assist			1
the @entity64 was again inventive in the blue of @entity61 against @entity66 on saturday , setting up @entity15 for a goal that finally sunk a resolute defence at @entity69			1
the former @entity71 man is settling in perfectly in west @entity72 , accumulating a pass accuracy of 93.5 per cent			2
@entity74 , @entity4 ( 35.9 ) @entity75 is desperate to bring in another striker to @entity4 , but if the performance at @entity78 was anything to go by , the @entity4 do n't need one			2
@entity74 , often castigated by fans			2
lead the line expertly against @entity8 , netting in the 3 - 1 win			2
the target man also boasted a pass completion rate of 85.7 per cent			2
instrumental : @entity61 's @entity38 comes in at @entity87 , gaining another assist and a pass accuracy of 93.5 no 8 : @entity74 hit back at his critics with a fine display against @entity8 7			2
@entity92 , @entity4 ( 37.7 ) another @entity4 man who has been criticised in recent years , @entity92 was dangerous all afternoon on saturday			0
the winger also scored in the victory , sending in many crosses , but also keeping his pass completion rate at an impressive 81.6 % ( 37 successful )			0
tricky : @entity92 was at the top of his game on the wing , scoring in the 3 - 1 win on saturday 6			1
@entity102 , @entity4 ( 38.3 ) @entity75 believes the @entity104 summer arrival can be the ' next @entity105 '			0
some pressure , but the Â£ 7m man produced all those powerful credentials and more against @entity8			0
five tackles , one assist and five successful dribbles			0
all you can ask for from the heartbeat of your side			0
no 6 : @entity102 has been compared with @entity105 and was impressive this weekend 5			1
@entity14 , @entity4 ( 41.5 ) completing the @entity4 party is @entity14 , who really stood out on his debut			0
the tricky @entity116 netted to cap a fine afternoon , where he played off @entity74 and linked the midfield and attack			0
as if a goal was n't enough , his pass completion rate was up at 92.9 per cent , an unheard of figure for a @entity4 forward			0
settling in : @entity14 controlled proceedings on his debut for the @entity4 against @entity8 4			0
@entity126 , @entity5 ( 41.6 ) one goal , one assist and a 92.9 per cent pass completion			0
it does n't get much better for a striker			0
@entity126 typified @entity5 's stunning showing against @entity9 on sunday , leading a free - flowing line - up that dominated proceedings at @entity134			0
no 4 : @entity135 comes in at @entity136 ... check out where the rest stand ( right ) 3			0
@entity15 , @entity61 ( 45.4 ) there 's no doubt @entity66 made @entity61 sweat at @entity69 on saturday ... but in the end quality shines through			1
hazard kept working at the visitors ' defence , twisting and turning , and was eventually rewarded with a well worked goal			0
the @entity146 also completed 37 passes in the opposition half , and amassed six successful dribbles			0
tricky : @entity15 would n't stop attacking the @entity66 defence , and was rewarded with a goal on form : the @entity146 completed six dribbles and 37 passes in the opposition half on saturday 2			1
@entity13 , @entity5 ( 45.6 ) @entity155 is joint top scorer of the @entity0			1
i bet you did n't think you 'd be saying that after two games			1
the @entity146 midfielder was in and out of the team last year but really came of age at @entity134 , netting twice in a comprehensive victory			0
a 92.9 per cent pass completion rate topped off his fine afternoon			0
no 2 : @entity13 finally shone for @entity5 against @entity9 on sunday 1			1
@entity165 , @entity166 ( 49.6 ) often criticised in his first season at the @entity169 , the @entity167 struggled for form and fitness after moving from @entity172			1
with @entity175 and @entity176 out of the picture in the summer though , @entity174 impressed in pre-season and seems to be bringing that form to the @entity178			0
two goals and a fine performance against @entity181 sees him top @entity10 list this week , netting his double from just three shots in total			1
no 1 : @entity165 stepped up for @entity166 with two goals against @entity181 on monday night top of the charts : two goals and an all - round fine performance helped @entity165 top this week 's table			1

@entity0 well underway after two games with @entity165 , @entity13 and @entity15 among those impressing this weekend
