a group of @entity2 tourists who caused outrage in @entity4 when they were charged £ 54 for just four ice creams have received an apology from the @entity9 capital 's mayor			1
@entity10 have also been invited back to the city by mayor @entity12 in an attempt to make off for their rip - off experience			2
after they complained to an @entity9 newspaper about how they were treated at the cafe where they bought the ice cream , many @entity4 residents warned that the incident could damage the reputation of the city , one of the world 's top tourist destinations			1
outraged : holidaymakers @entity27 , his brother @entity27 and their wives @entity31 and @entity32 with the receipt for their ice cream mr and mrs @entity38 , along with mr @entity27 's brother @entity35 and his wife @entity32 , were handed the extortionate bill on sunday , the last day of their holiday in @entity9			1
they had ordered three scoops of ice cream each to take away from the @entity46 cafe near the @entity47 , and were charged € 64 ( £ 54 ) for their snacks			1
ripped off : the scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being ' ripped off ' by local businesses mr @entity27 , 58 , today told @entity55 of his shock at receiving the bill : ' it was just disbelief and then giving the money and having the change slapped down , the five euro note and the one euro coin , and then the receipt - 64 euros - we just walked out in disbelief			1
' but after they went to a newspaper , he said , mr @entity12 had got in contact offering ' sincere apologies ' and saying he was ' very upset ' about the incident			0
mr @entity27 , from @entity69 in the @entity70 , said the family had been told they would be treated to a free ice cream if they returned to @entity4			1
he earlier described how the group had been on a six - day trip to @entity4 , adding : ' up until then we 'd had a brilliant time , but that left a bad taste in the mouth – quite literally			2
to be honest the ice cream was n't that nice either			1
we 'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday			0
' i felt i had been ripped off but what could i do ? ' @entity85 , a local councillor , said of the tourists ' ordeal : ' they were justifiably outraged at what they had been asked to pay , and it should not be allowed			0
there needs to be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to unsuspecting tourists			0
' it does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here			0
' @entity102 cost : the family were horrified by the high price after buying ice creams at the @entity46 bar ( left of picture ) in @entity4 mr @entity85 added that he had personally offered to refund the money to the group but they had told him donate it to a charity			2
the ice cream parlour in question gave a chilly response			1
a staff member who refused to give her name said : ' the prices are clearly on display			0
they got what they asked for – four ice creams			0
' she said the gelateria 's most expensive cone is € 25 ( £ 21 ) and added : ' they got 16 euros ' worth of ice cream each – almost a kilo			1
what more did they want ? ' we get this all the time … but the prices are there in black and white			0
if they do n't want the ice cream they can go somewhere else			2
' @entity140 , president of @entity9 's @entity142 consumer group , said it had officially requested ' an immediate investigation into this fraud '			0
