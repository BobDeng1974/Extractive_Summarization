by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 23 may 2013 a girl born with one ear is being denied a hearing aid for her first day of school because of where she lives			1
@entity6 , four , was born with a rare condition called hemifacial microsomia which affects the development of the lower half of the face			2
it left her with just one functioning ear , meaning she desperately needs a special device to allow her to hear her teachers clearly on her first day of school in september			2
@entity6 , ( pictured with mother , @entity17 ) 4 , was born without a right ear and has hearing loss meaning she will struggle to hear her teachers when she starts school in september her mother @entity17 , 31 , applied for the bone anchored hearing aid implant ( @entity24 ) which transmits sound directly through the skull and reaches the inner ear			1
but she says @entity6 is the victim of a ‘ postcode lottery ’ with two @entity29 trusts arguing about who should pay the £ 3,000 bill			1
while other children elsewhere in @entity33 get the aid @entity6 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , faces starting school without one			1
ms @entity6 said : ‘ other families in the same situation elsewhere in the @entity33 have been offered a @entity24			2
they do n't have to go crawling around to other trusts			0
ms @entity41 asked @entity42 to provide the £ 3,000 bone anchored hearing aid that @entity6 needs but the @entity46 referred her to @entity47 which has also failed to help ‘ i do n't know how long this process is going to take			1
it 's just so unclear where we stand , whereas other people seem to have great support			0
‘ @entity6 struggles now in a nursery setting			0
we have become more concerned with her affected side and how she will cope with starting school in september , but they seem to be passing the buck			1
’ ms @entity6 first tried unsuccessfully to get a @entity24 from the former @entity36 and @entity60 which later became @entity42			1
when she asked @entity42 for the device she was told she could n't have one and was instead directed to @entity47 , which has also failed to deliver			1
after endless consultations and letters ms @entity6 now fears the vital aid will not reach her daughter before she starts school			2
a spokesman for @entity42 said : ‘ this particular type of equipment is funded by @entity47			2
we have written to the consultant caring for @entity6 to advise him of this			0
’ @entity47 refused to comment on individual cases but a spokesman said : ‘ from april 1 , 2013 there was a new national commissioning policy in place providing guidance on bone anchored hearing aids for hearing loss			1
‘ this now ensures patients have the same access to treatment irrespective of where they live in the country			0
’ @entity91 microsomia is a condition which causes the tissue on one side of the face to be underdeveloped			0
it is a congenital disorder and it affects one in 3,500 to 4,500 children and is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts			0
it is believed to result from a developmental problem in the early stages of pregnancy and the level of deformity varies significantly , as does the area of the face affected			0
it is most common for the ear , side of the skull , cheek tissue , jaw , teeth or facial nerves to be affected			0
the main form of treatment is reconstructive surgery .			0

@entity6 was born with no right ear and she has hearing loss
needs a £ 3,000 bone anchored hearing aid implant before starting school
this would transmit sound directly through her skull to her inner ear
@entity29 @entity42 *initially* told her mother , @entity17 , it would not provide the device
was directed to @entity47 which has also failed to help
