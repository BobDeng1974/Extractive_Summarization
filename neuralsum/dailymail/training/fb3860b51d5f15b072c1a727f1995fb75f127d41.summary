@entity0 is to wholly take over building and testing its new @entity3 craft from the company that designed and built the first aircraft , which was destroyed in a fatal crash last year			1
@entity8 's space tourism firm confirmed that work on the second spaceship is now being fully conducted by its @entity0 owned sister company @entity11			1
test flights of the rocket , which is about 90 per cent complete , will also be performed by @entity0 pilots rather than those from its partner @entity18			1
one of the pilots , @entity29 , 39 , a father of two , was killed in the crash			0
the accident is thought to have strained the relationship between @entity18 and @entity0			1
since the crash at least 24 passengers who had signed up for flights with @entity0 are thought to have demanded refunds			2
the two companies have a long history together , first signing a deal in 2004 that led to engineers from @entity18 designing and building @entity0 's first @entity3 rocket , designed to take paying passengers into space			1
however , last year 's accident that led to the @entity3 rocket breaking up in midair just seconds after disembarking from its mothership aircraft , led to @entity0 publicly emphasising that it was not in charge of the failed flight			1
a spokesman for @entity0 said it would continue to work with @entity18 and that they would provide a supporting role while the second spaceship is built and tested			1
they insisted that the agreement between the companies had always been that @entity0 would be responsible for the building and testing of the second spaceship			2
the company said : ' our second spaceship is being built by our wholly - owned sister organization , @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , who along with @entity0 , will be responsible for testing and operating the vehicle			1
' ' our team is organizing the remaining build schedule of the spaceship to accommodate potential lessons from the ongoing @entity70 investigation			0
' we are committed to making any modifications or improvements that we feel are necessary to improve the safety of the vehicle			0
' @entity0 has also hired @entity75 , a former test pilot with @entity18 , to head its test flight team along with @entity77 , the former launch integration manager for @entity80 's @entity79			1
it also has its own team of test pilots , including @entity83 , a former @entity84 test pilot who flew the harrier jump jet			2
@entity0 was always due to take over the testing and construction of the @entity3 , but only after the test flights were considered to be a success			1
@entity0 has pushed forward with an aggressive construction schedule to finish building the second @entity3 rocket despite the ongoing investigation into the crash			1
preliminary findings by the @entity70 in the @entity95 said that a video taken inside the cockpit showed co-pilot @entity29 prematurely unlocking the spacecraft 's moveable tail			0
co-pilot @entity29 was killed after the first @entity3 rocket broke apart on a test flight his spaceship broke up at 50,000 feet , he had no oxygen , and was traveling at the speed of sound			1
yet test pilot @entity105 , 43 , survived with just a shoulder injury			2
investigators have been trying to piece together how he was thrown free of the spacecraft as it disintegrated while his colleague @entity29 was killed			0
strapped into his seat , @entity105 was flung out of the cockpit as @entity3 began to break apart			2
despite the huge forces he would have been subjected to as he plunged , he managed to unbuckle himself from his seat			0
the temperatures at that altitude would have been at least -70 degrees c and the air would have been perilously thin			0
@entity3 pilots wear thin flight jumpsuits , offering little protection against the bitter cold of the upper atmosphere			1
it is thought he may have fallen for miles to get into warmer , thicker air before finally releasing himself from his seat			0
as he did , his parachute deployed automatically , allowing him to fall safely to the ground			0
@entity3 exploded in midair ( above ) during a test flight conducted by @entity18 last october an investigation into the crash , which scattered debris across the @entity27 ( above ) , is still ongoing he did not move a second lever designed to move the tail , but it deployed anyway			1
this may have started a series of events that caused the rocket to break apart 100 miles north east of @entity142			0
it is still unclear whether aerodynamic forces or a malfunction caused the tail to move			0
the final conclusions of the investigation are not due to be published until later this year			2
however , in a statement on its website , @entity0 said it was pushing ahead with the construction of its second @entity3 at a hanger in the @entity154 desert			1
it hopes to begin test flights later this year			1
@entity0 also said that it will begin manufacturing its third @entity3 rocket this year			1
@entity0 has promised to make improvements on its second rocket , which it is currently constructing , using the findings from the official investigation into the crash of the first @entity3 rocket ( above ) @entity0 has emphasised that the failed @entity3 test flight , which broke apart above the @entity27 ( above ) , was conducted by @entity18 and the company has now taken over test flights itself @entity3 has been under development at @entity167 and @entity168 in the desert northeast of @entity142			1
@entity3 is carried aloft by a specially designed mothership and then released before igniting its rocket for suborbital thrill ride into space and then a return to @entity175 as a glider			1
ticket cost : the starting price for flights is $ 250,000 ( £ 150,000 ) - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by @entity8 and his family			2
training : passengers are required to go through a ' @entity183 ' , including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly			0
once aboard : @entity3 will carry six passengers and two pilots			2
each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead			0
the space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity			0
flight path : a climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			2
passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity205 line , the boundary of @entity175 's atmosphere , at which point @entity3 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity210 the spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness , with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours			2
the spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound flight frequency : initially one per week , eventually to have two flights per day			2
this graphic explains how passengers will be carried to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites and are then carried into space on a flight lasting 3.5 hours at speeds of nearly four times the speed of sound @entity226 , 43 , and @entity29 , who were flying @entity3 last year when it broke apart , both worked for @entity18			1
mr @entity226 was thrown from the plane still in his seat and managed to unbuckle himself as he plunged to @entity175 and his parachute deployed			0
according to the @entity231 , @entity230 , the president of @entity18 , confirmed that his company would no longer be involved in testing of virgin 's @entity3			1
@entity3 , seen above docked to its mothership aircraft in march 2010 , was dubbed the @entity237 however , he said the company would still work as a consultant to @entity0			1
' we will always consider these people our partner , ' @entity230 said			0
' in any situation like that , emotions are high			0
everybody needs to take time out to have the facts settle out			0
' @entity8 ’s plan to send paying passengers into space has attracted famous names who have purchased tickets , including @entity254 and @entity255 , @entity256 and his manager @entity257 , @entity258 , who plans to try and sing in space , @entity260 , and @entity261 , who was the 500th customer to purchase a ticket			0
@entity263 also got a ticket for his birthday from ex-wife @entity266 when the two were married			0
@entity268 bought a ticket as well so @entity263 would not have to go alone			0
@entity270 and @entity271 are also set to fly , but got their seats for free .			0

@entity0 confirms that it will construct and test new rocket itself
it comes after ten years of working with *aerospace* firm @entity18
@entity18 was in charge of test flight that crashed in october
@entity0 hopes to conduct tests on second @entity3 later this year
@entity3 was *originally* designed and built by @entity18
second rocket is being built by @entity0 - owned @entity11
@entity18 will continue to offer support on a consultancy basis
the new rocket is 90 per cent complete and work on a third is due to start
