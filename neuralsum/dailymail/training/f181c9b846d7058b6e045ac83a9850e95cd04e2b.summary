by @entity0 published : 12:34 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 15:33 est , 6 february 2013 the @entity2 games are some of the most cinematic ever made , raising the bar on @entity5 in terms of story - telling and graphics			1
and even though the @entity5 is coming to the end of its life , developers @entity11 - behind the @entity14 games - are determined to push the console 's limits one final time			1
in hiding : @entity11 and @entity19 have kept quiet about @entity20 for some time , however , early screens suggest it will be one of the @entity5 's best - looking titles enter @entity20 , which follows the story of two survivors after a deadly fungus outbreak			1
black - marketeer @entity26 made a promise to an old friend to look after a young girl called @entity20 , and together they have to make their way across a fiercely militarised @entity33 , journeying through quarantined towns maintained through martial law			0
to make matters worse , they also have to fight off the infected , whose sole aim is to continue spreading the disease			0
apart from brilliant graphics ( powered by @entity11 's in - house engine ) , the game 's most staggering feature is its @entity44			1
using a system called ' @entity47 ' enemies will react realistically to your behaviour			2
they may aggressively group together and attack you if they have the edge in battle			0
however , if you have the advantage , they 'll take cover more or try and sneak up behind you			0
life - like : characters will react realistically according to how you approach battles			2
multiplayer , too , has been confirmed with @entity11 last year defending concerns that it would feel ' tacked on ' to the single player the enemy will also react if one of their friends is killed , showing fear and anger while warning other teammates of the situation			1
@entity20 , too , will dynamically influence battles by throwing objects or causing distractions			0
it 's set for release on may 7			2
