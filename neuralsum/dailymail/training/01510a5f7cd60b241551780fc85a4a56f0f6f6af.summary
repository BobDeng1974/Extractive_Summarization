rumours are currently flying as to what @entity2 ’s big announcement , scheduled for later today , will reveal			1
last week , the car maker 's chief executive @entity4 tweeted that the company would unveil ‘ the @entity7 ’ and ‘ something else ’ on 9 october - although a time was n't given			1
one of the announcements is thought to be an upgrade to existing @entity2 cars such as driver assist technology , while the other could be a new sports car akin to a @entity16			1
here comes ' the @entity7 ' : @entity17 - based @entity2 is set to make two major announcements today			1
rumours claim they may reveal a sports car that goes 0 - 60 in three seconds			1
the development was teased by chief executive @entity4 on @entity22 last week ( pictured ) in an interview with @entity25 ’s @entity24 , @entity4 revealed that one of the features would be something current @entity2 owners could just ‘ turn on ’ , reported @entity30			1
he also confirmed that guesses on the internet were ' directionally correct , but the magnitude is not appreciated yet			0
' @entity4 has indicated that one of the announcements might be something existing @entity2 users can just ‘ turn on ’			1
this may indicate he will reveal driver assists , such as a system to monitor your speed or lane driving assists			2
this may also be a change in the technology that gives the @entity2 greater range			0
other rumours suggest they will release an electric supercar that can go 0 - 60 in three seconds , rivalling other cars like the @entity51			1
this indicates it is a planned upgrade to modern @entity2 cars , or perhaps something they can purchase as an addition			0
theories about what the other announcement might be range from a self - driving car , a @entity2 with greater range or an all - wheel drive vehicle			2
however according to website @entity65 , the announcement will be a new sports car called the @entity68 that can go from 0 to 60 in less than three seconds			1
this would be a new ‘ supersport ’ version of the current @entity71 they claim a source has revealed ‘ the @entity7 ’ will be a supercar , which will be able to compete with other high - end vehicles like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
and @entity65 is banking its money on the other announcement being autonomous driving - possibly a form of driver assist			0
speculation suggests this may be technology that helps regular a car ’s speed , and also warn it of any dangers when moving into another lane			0
last week on @entity92 said : ‘ about time to unveil the @entity93 and something else			2
’ but when internet commenters revealed that ‘ the @entity7 ’ had some rather rude connotations , @entity4 let slip some more information			0
‘ i love the @entity98			0
comments had me literally @entity100			0
no , it was n’t intentional			0
glad i did n’t mention the other letter ! ’ however , according to website @entity65 , the announcement will be a new sports car called the @entity68 that will be able to compete with other high - end vehicles like @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
. this would be a new ‘ supersport ’ version of the current @entity71 , and separate to the existing @entity110 ( shown ) pictured is a black 2010 @entity51 on a rural road in @entity113			2
the @entity51 has a top speed of 252.97mph ( 407.12km/h )			0
it was named @entity116 's @entity115 from 2000 to 2009 based on @entity4 's next tweet ( shown ) some have suggested the announcement may be a driver - assisted version of one of @entity2 's previous cars , such as the @entity71 in the image , the teased car looks to be similar to the @entity71 earlier this year @entity2 revealed the ' @entity126 ' mainstream electric car some have suggested the other letter might be a ‘ p ’ , although what either could stand for is unknown			1
currently , @entity2 has about 100 ' @entity132 ' stations scattered across @entity133 and @entity134 that give @entity71 drivers a free power source when traveling long distances			2
the technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes			0
@entity2 recently opened three supercharger stations in @entity142 and plans to set up about 200 more around the world , including @entity144 , by the end of the year			2
earlier this year , @entity2 unveiled the @entity126 - a mainstream version of its other electric vehicles priced around £ 30,000 in the @entity148 and $ 35,000 in the @entity149			1
at the time @entity4 unveiled his displeasure at being unable to call it the ‘ @entity154 ’ due to legal action from @entity153			0
the previous two @entity2 cars are called the @entity71 and the @entity156 , and @entity4 apparently wanted to spell out the word ‘ sex ’ with all three			1
' we were going to call it model e for a while and then @entity153 sued us saying it wanted to use the @entity154 , ’ @entity4 told @entity163 at the time			2
‘ i thought this is crazy , @entity153 ’s trying to kill sex ! so we ’ll have to think of another name			0
’ exactly what the letter @entity166 ' for the new announcement is trying to spell if anything , though , remains to be seen .			0
