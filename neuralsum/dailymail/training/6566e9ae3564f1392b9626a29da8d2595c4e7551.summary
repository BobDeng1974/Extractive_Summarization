' in recent days it has become crystal clear that the club 's current board is considering the use of @entity5 and @entity27 in order to secure a further loan from @entity7			1
' mr @entity7 already has security over @entity58 and the @entity59 and the @entity0 , like almost all @entity1 supporters , feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far			1
' @entity5 , in our view , is sacrosanct			0
it is a memorial to the sixty six who lost their lives ( in the @entity69 )			0
' some of the greatest names in @entity37 football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club			2
' for that reason , the @entity0 confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club 's assets			1
@entity7 wants to use the @entity5 and club 's training ground as security against his loan ' we enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the @entity1 yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of @entity5 and @entity27			1
' @entity1 fans donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the @entity0 during the administration process when their club was at risk and it appears our major assets are at risk once again			2
' now , more than ever , we need the @entity1 fan base to unite with the collective goal of protecting our assets and taking the club forward			2

' fan ownership initiatives introduced by the @entity1 and @entity110 can make a positive and immediate difference and the @entity0 will do everything possible to provide support to such organisations			2
