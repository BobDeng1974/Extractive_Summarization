by @entity0 last updated at 8:00 pm on 5th october 2011 @entity2 @entity1 has revealed for the first time why she refused to look at the horrific photographs of murdered @entity5 during her appeal and how she is ' not the monster of @entity8			1
' @entity9 , 24 , was sensationally released from jail earlier this week , along with her former boyfriend @entity11 , 27 , after being dramatically cleared of killing student @entity5 , 21 , who was found semi-naked and with her throat cut			1
during the trial graphic photographs of her mutilated body were shown to the court by the @entity19 family lawyer @entity18 , without the public gallery being cleared and which he justified by saying it was ' necessary to show her suffering			1
' fresh agony : @entity19 , pictured today on her return to the @entity26 , faces new turmoil after @entity1 revealed she could n't bear to look at dead pictures of her sister in jail @entity2 @entity1 insisted in never before seen notes that the evidence against as to whether she killed @entity5 , right , was always ' unreliable and circumstantial ' in never before seen notes written the day they were shown @entity9 said : ' i could not bring myself to look at the photographs of @entity5 's body because i could not stand to see the way she had been reduced			1
' i never saw @entity39 ( @entity5 ) dead other than in those photographs which my lawyers showed me and which shocked me			2
i ca n't look at them calmly because @entity39 was my friend			2
' @entity9 then added : ' i am not the @entity44			2
' in his closing argument , prosecutor @entity45 had attacked @entity9 and @entity11 for not looking at the photographs - suggesting it was an indication of their guilt			2
the notes also reveal how @entity9 felt she had been betrayed by the @entity54 police and prosecutors - a theme she had mentioned in her dramatic and heartfelt plea of innocence just before judge @entity59 and his jury retired to consider their verdict			0
writing in blue biro she said : ' justice already failed me			0
need for justice for @entity39 parallel , not contrasting , with need for justice for me and @entity70			0
' no history of violence / mental disturbance			0
did n't run away ( the wicked flee )			0
' she then added : ' naive , unable to understand the aggressive insistence of the investigators , unable to defend myself			0
' our lives have been destroyed ' : @entity5 's family have spoken of their agony ' the development of the appeal highlights the fact that the evidence against me is either unreliable or circumstantial			1
' this was in reference to the independent report carried out by two court appointed experts into the dna findings on two hotly contested pieces of evidence - the 30cm kitchen knife found at @entity11 's apartment and a clasp from @entity5 's bloodied bra			1
the original trial heard how their was dna from @entity9 on the handle and that of @entity105 on the blade but the experts said that of the victim was so low that it should be considered unreliable and not used to convict her of murder			1
resting place : the flower - strewn temporary grave of @entity5 , near her family home while the clasp was found six weeks after the murder and there was the very high possibility that the dna from @entity11 found on it was there by cross contamination - these were the only two elements that put them both at the murder scene			1
@entity9 added in her notes , which were written in a mixture of @entity129 and @entity54 , that she was ' naive to believe the investigators were unbiased ' as she described how she had been pressured into wrongly naming bar man @entity5 as the killer			0
after hours of questioning she had said she had ' covered her ears as @entity136 murdered @entity5 in her bedroom ' which led him to being arrested and held in jail for two weeks before being released			0
homecoming : the @entity140 home of @entity1 's family has been decorated in anticipation of her return at her appeal trial earlier this week she was convicted of this slander against him and given three years but as she had already spent four in jail she was freed - although she was ordered to pay him 22.000 @entity150 damages			1
she said : ' the objective of the interrogation was to leave me with no choice but to convince me to confirm their premeditations against me , ' before adding that police are making mistakes by not believing their alibis			0
@entity9 also wrote : ' no justice for @entity39 by perpetuating my injustice			0

fresh agony for @entity19 family . sister shows strain back in @entity167
@entity169 insisted evidence against her was ' unreliable and circumstantial '
