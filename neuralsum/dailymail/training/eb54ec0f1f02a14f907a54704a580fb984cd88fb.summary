about 1.4 million years ago the ancestors of modern man constructed what is believed to be the first - ever tool : the hand axe			1
and now designers of reimagined what those primitive tools might be like if they came face to face with modern architecture			0
the results are a series of objects that highlight some specific features of the multi-purpose tool that was once used to chop , cut , attack and more			0
@entity16 based designers have re-imagined a tool from 1.4 million years ago			1
the man made project used 3d scanning and printing to create different handles and grips			1
pictured is one of the designs , a hand - held grip that could be placed in the palm of either the left or right hand the man made project , an evolution of an earlier series called @entity35 - @entity34 , is the work of @entity16 designers @entity38 and @entity39 , the latter of whom passed away in 2012			1
to create the tools they first gathered flint rocks of desirable size , shape and quality from the @entity49 desert in southern @entity50			1
they then moulded the fling into a pointed shape using a softer stone - a process known as knapping			2
by chipping away at it the flint breaks , a similar technique that was used 1.4 million years ago			1
‘ @entity65 to say , this is also where the bleeding comes in , ’ the researchers add , referring to the pain that can be induced from the shockwave of each strike			0
each flint hand axe was then 3d - scanned at the @entity68			2
the digital hand axe files then had handles custom - designed to highlight the varying uses of the first - ever tools			1
the handles were printed and then applied to each hand axe , joining two very distant technologies ; flint knapping and 3d - printing			1
the primitive object used by the distant ancestors of modern man is believed to be the first - ever tool			1
on the left here is pictured an adze , a tool probably used for woodworking in a chopping - pulling motion			0
on the right is an example of someone holding the simple hand - gripped version to make their own tools the designers found flint rocks in the @entity49 desert in southern @entity50			1
they then used softer stones to mould the rocks into the shape they wanted just like was done 1.4 million years ago , a process known as knapping			1
shown is a two - handed grasping tool for a digging or pounding motion our large brains , long legs and ability to craft tools are often thought to have evolved together at the start of the @entity111 lineage up to 2.4 million years ago			1
but climate and fossil evidence earlier this year shows these unique traits may have originated much earlier in our @entity117 ancestors , between three and four million years ago			1
the research also suggests that rather than forming as a single package , these key traits evolved individually , over a much longer timeframe			0
the analysis , published in the journal @entity124 , led the team to conclude that the ability of early humans to adjust to changing conditions ultimately enabled the earliest species of @entity111 to vary , survive , and begin spreading from @entity130 to @entity131 1.85 million years ago			2
one example of an ancient use for the tool was a handle that allowed it to be gripped in the palm of the hand to strike downwards			0
another had a longer handle with a hand grip to mimic an action similar to a mason hitting a chisel with a hammer			0
the teardrop - shaped hand axe was a prehistoric stone tool that the researchers say was ‘ probably the most popular tool ever , with a span of over 1.4 million years of use and found across several continents including @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity130 and @entity156			1
’ the abundance and span of the stone axe in the archaeological record has led to several theories explaining its longevity			0
one is that its shape was an aesthetic preference , as ‘ the pleasure we derive from symmetrical forms has been associated with our understanding that a person with a symmetrical body is probably healthy , and therefore desirable for mating , ’ say the researchers			0
the versatile hand axe could also be crafted into a spear , shown here , by extending itself wedge - like into a split piece of wood			2
a polymer part serves as a mediator between the organic and the mineral how was a hand axe carried ? this thought resides in the clip - on holster ( shown ) along with the notion that if you are already carrying a stone when threatened by a predator , you will likely throw it at the predator regardless of the time invested in making it the use of latching is illustrated in the axe with interchangeable stone - holding heads ( shown )			0
although there are several variations of the teardrop - form , most tools of this sort were thought to follow similar geometric guidelines , namely a directional shape with a sharp edge they add : ' additionally , the existence of oversized or unused hand axes has fostered the idea that perhaps its purpose was a courtship object , boasting an individual 's dexterity , ability to plan ahead , or to make tools , and generally to be a good provider , traits increasing the chance of survival			2
' a direct parallel can be drawn to underlying cues in today 's material culture : extravagant cars , jewelry and accessories or brand names ( presumably ) signaling an individual 's social and financial standing and hence , ability to provide			0
' some speculation remains as to the hand axe 's exact use , but it is generally accepted that the hand axe was a multi-tool , a tool that could be wielded in several manners , and function in various ways within changing scenarios of utilization			2
' it is added that although there are several variations of the teardrop - form exist , most follow similar geometric guidelines , namely a directional shape with a sharp edge			0
the size also needs to be one that can be grasped in one hand			0
the principal of indirect percussion , an action similar to a mason hitting a chisel with a hammer and transferring the force to a stone , was exemplified by the forming of a platform above the hand grip ( shown left )			0
on the right is a tool that may have been useful for cutting this perhaps more tongue - in - cheek design for a tripod hand axe display is , according to the researchers , ' a courtship object , a means of boasting your stone tool making abilities , perhaps getting lucky and passing those traits on in evolution '			2
