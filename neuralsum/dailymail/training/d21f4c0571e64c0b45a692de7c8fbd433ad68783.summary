@entity0 believes @entity1 can build with confidence towards the @entity3 despite their latest agonising defeat to a southern hemisphere giant			1
@entity1 had been on course for a first ever win over @entity7 on @entity7 soil when they led 30 - 24 in the dying moments of the second test in @entity12			1
but their hopes were dashed when an illegal challenge by @entity15 full - back @entity16 on @entity7 wing @entity18 resulted in a penalty try , which @entity21 converted to give the home side a 31 - 30 victory and a 2 - 0 @entity25 success			1
upbeat : @entity0 is happy so far with @entity1 ' build - up to next summer 's @entity3 penalised : @entity1 lost the game against @entity7 after @entity16 ( 15 ) was penalised for an illegal challenge having turned in disappointing performances against @entity30 and @entity31 in the @entity32 , as well as in the first test in @entity34 , plenty of questions had been asked of the tourists just 15 months out from next year 's global showpiece			1
but they answered their critics in fine style , with the likes of @entity43 , tireless skipper @entity44 and @entity45 producing monumental individual displays			2
@entity0 admits a win against one of @entity7 , @entity47 and @entity48 is needed by his side with the knowledge their @entity3 group contains two heavyweights in the @entity55 and hosts @entity30			1
but the @entity56 felt the second @entity58 performance has highlighted his men can compete with the best in the game			2
@entity62 : @entity44 was superb against the @entity7 powerful : as was @entity45 he said : ' sometimes you play against the best teams in the world and our players that come in have n't always played at the same level of intensity			1
' that 's why we got caught out last week , particularly in the first half			2
' we were also caught out in the first test in @entity48 a couple of years ago and in the first test in @entity47 in 2010 as well			1
' but the boys have got comfortable with the pace and intensity and have come out and improved their performances in the second week			0
' we have such a small playing base of players			0
we have got an incredibly tough pool for the @entity3 , but we can look forward to it with some confidence			0
' we know on the day if we get the bounce of the ball and a couple of things go our way we are good enough to compete with the top teams in the world			0
' we are probably a little bit off @entity47 at the moment , but we have demonstrated with @entity7 and @entity48 in the last couple of years it 's just a case of getting over the line			1
' it 's just making sure that you get that elusive victory over a southern hemisphere team and then mentally it just changes that whole focus			0
' mauled : @entity1 battle against the @entity104 pack during the second test in @entity12 runner runner : @entity18 ( right ) of @entity7 charges upfield with the ball in hand the first - @entity58 reverse at @entity110 had led to calls for a number of changes to be made in @entity12 , but in the end @entity0 chose to make only two alterations , bringing in prop @entity116 and flanker @entity117 for @entity118 and @entity119 respectively			1
captain @entity44 felt the players had justified their coach 's loyalty , and hopefully silenced their critics			0
' i think there was 77 minutes and 15 seconds on the clock and we were still in the lead , ' he said			2
' ultimately we can take a bit of pride out of the week as a whole , not just the performance			0
' a lot of negativity , which we try to ignore , gets bounced about with social media			0
with stuff like that , you are never too far away from home			0
' but as a collective we can be proud and , moving forward , this is not the result we would have wanted going into the off season , but definitely the performance			0
