@entity0 has moved a step closer to recovery from the serious ankle injury that has wrecked his season after completing 90 minutes for @entity5 ’s under 21 side			1
the @entity8 midfielder came through the 4 - 1 win over @entity10 unscathed as he pushes for a return to @entity13 ’s first team before the end of the campaign			2
he was joined by @entity16 and @entity17 , recovering from ankle and calf injuries respectively , in the @entity21 fixture at the @entity22			1
@entity0 moved a step closer to recovery from the serious ankle injury after 90 minutes for the @entity26 side @entity0 tries to cut inside of @entity10 's @entity28 during the match in the @entity30 @entity31 stole the show with a hat - trick for @entity5 at the @entity22 alongside a few of their senior stars hat - trick hero @entity31 is capped for @entity8 ’s youth teams but likely to play for @entity38 @entity5 21 : @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity17 ( @entity44 71 ) , @entity16 ( c ) ( @entity45 60 ) , @entity46 , @entity0 , @entity47 , @entity31 substitutes not used : @entity48 ( gk ) ; @entity49 , @entity50 scorers : @entity31 23 , 40 , 90 +2 ; @entity45 73 @entity10 under 21 : @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 61 ) , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 66 ) , @entity60 ( c ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 71 ) , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity28 substitutes not used : @entity65 ( gk ) ; @entity66 scorer : @entity68 8 referee : @entity70 attendance : 2,674 @entity0 has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity75 on november 22 but is finally nearing full fitness			1
it has been the latest in a succession of injury problems that have hampered his development into the world class player he was expected to become for club and country			0
having made a return to action in a reserve friendly with @entity90 last week , this was a step up in quality for @entity0 and he exerted a quiet influence without taking a hold on the game			2
he saw a free - kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first - half that culminated in @entity46 firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of @entity10 goalkeeper @entity52			0
@entity0 might have capped his night with a goal but his improvised volley from a @entity43 - @entity43 cross was saved before @entity45 slammed home the rebound for @entity5 ’s third on 73 minutes			1
@entity16 , who has been on the sidelines since the @entity111 game with @entity112 on november 26 , captained the team but failed to make much of an impact during his hour of involvement			0
@entity17 , whose never - ending succession of injuries has seen him absent for an astonishing 226 weeks of his @entity5 career , was arguably their most influential performer as he fights for a new contract			1
@entity16 was among the players as he stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury @entity0 runs with the ball during the @entity30 match on tuesday night at the @entity22 with his runs through the centre of midfield , @entity17 caused plenty of problems for the @entity10 defence and he had two opportunities to get on the scoresheet in his 70 minutes of action			1
on 17 minutes , a lovely through ball from @entity46 set him clear inside the box but a last - ditch tackle ruined everything and , shortly afterwards , he curled a shot a fraction over the bar from the edge of the area			0
with the first - teamers mis - firing , it was left to @entity31 to make an impression with two clinical first - half goals that were almost identical and a stoppage time third			0
on 23 minutes , @entity31 , who is capped for @entity8 ’s youth teams but likely to play for @entity38 , surged at the @entity10 defence , beat two men and fired crisply across the keeper and into the far corner			1
and he repeated the trick five minutes before the break , locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to @entity17 ’s slide - rule pass			2
@entity17 of @entity5 pictured shooting during the match between @entity26 and @entity160 @entity8 midfielder @entity0 came through the 4 - 1 win over @entity10 unscathed on tuesday night @entity5 had started on the back foot and fell behind eight minutes in when the highly - rated @entity28 was gifted the simplest of close - range finishes when goalkeeper @entity39 fumbled a cross from @entity64			1
but by the time @entity31 completed his hat - trick in stoppage time , @entity5 were in complete control			0
it was the best of the young striker ’s treble as he burst forward at lightning pace and delicately lifted the ball over the keeper			0
when @entity5 ’s senior side have been a @entity178 team for a century , it seems incongruous to find the under 21s stuck in the second division			2
but that could soon be rectified			0
this win kept them in touch with the leading pack and @entity5 retain games in hand on all above them as they seek to claim one of the two promotion places to the top division .			0
