in the last couple of weeks , two relationships with enormous age gaps have caught the nation 's attention			1
the first was @entity8 's engagement to @entity9 , who is 30 years younger than him - the happy couple are now married after signing the civil register in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the second was the news that @entity16 's @entity15 was dating a woman 46 years his junior			1
but why do age gaps continue to shock ? older men dating women in their twenties has been happening for centuries			2
the pair , who have a 30 year age difference , got married yesterday afternoon in @entity12			1
they are one of several @entity30 romances that features an age gap spanning generations and the difference in maturity has sparked enormous interest from the @entity37 public			1
but why do age gap romances continue to be such a source of fascination , given that they have been happening for centuries ? but each time an older man steps out with a young woman , or more recently the reverse , the nation makes a collective gasp			1
@entity48 married @entity49 , who was 15 years her junior , and the couple stayed together for several years , but the public were never quite able to get to grips with the romance			2
@entity55 's fling with @entity56 caused such disgust that for a time it almost looked like it would derail her career			2
and @entity60 's love of toyboys in recent years has almost overshadowed her musical career			2
in @entity30 alone , there have been numerous romances between women and men of different generations in the last yen years alone			2
led zeppelin guitarist @entity15 , 71 , and his 25 - year - old actress girlfriend @entity68			1
the pair , who have a 46 year age gap , celebrated his birthday at @entity72 's this week so why do some men and women go for someone much older or younger instead or a person their own age ? sex therapist @entity78 , who wrote the book @entity80 , says it 's a cliche , but age is nothing but a number			1
she explained to @entity85 : ' in case you have n't noticed , we feel the same as we get older as we did when we were young , on the inside at least - it 's only when we look in the mirror we see the signs of ageing			2
' psychologically , having a trophy wife on your arm gives the same effect as flash cars and watches - admiration and significance , it 's almost as if having this young partner quantifies how successful they are			0
' but although she understands the reasons for wanting a younger woman or man on your arm , @entity78 warns that there are several cons to an age gap relationship			1
she said : ' this difference in age creates many problems as interests do change with age , as do energy levels			0
' it is well known that men and women reach their sexual peak at a different ages ( men early 20s women late 30s early 40s ) , so while a young toy boy may well be able to satisfy an older woman an older man may leave his younger wife feeling unfulfilled			0
' this is not something to be overlooked - sex is key to all successful relationships as it clears blocks and maintains connection			0
' however , if the partners can embrace the differences , then maturity can be a good balance for the immaturity and the youthful enthusiasm can keep the older partner young			0
' friends of @entity8 say that his relationship with @entity9 has made him happier than he has been in years according to new research by dating website @entity146 , the stereotype of the older man seeking an increasingly younger partner does in fact ring true			1
men aged 60 - 69 set , on average , a desired partner age of up to 11 years younger than themselves , while the oldest they would accept is someone just 1 year older			2
but younger men buck the trend , with those aged up to 30 preferring to date someone older than younger			0
between the ages of 20 - 29 , many men indicate a preference for a partner 3 - 6 years older than themselves			0
the website 's psychologist @entity161 believes that men aged 20 - 29 now looking for older women pver a younger model is largely down to the change in gender roles in modern society , with far more equality between the sexes nowadays			0
he said : ' young men nowadays probably recognise that older women are adept at diligently juggling so many responsibilities like a career , children , housekeeping , fitness , finances and socialising			0
' this makes them intriguing , attractive and a more secure option			0
' would you date a much older ( or younger ) man ? @entity85 looks at the @entity30 starlets who did : @entity184 , 45 , with his partner @entity185 , 28			2
