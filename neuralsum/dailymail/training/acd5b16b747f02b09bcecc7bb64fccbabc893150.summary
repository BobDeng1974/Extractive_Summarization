@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 and @entity6 fixtures			0
@entity7 wants his @entity9 team to defend from the front and both @entity11 and @entity12 are getting the message			1
the two young forwards scored a goal each in the 2 - 1 win at @entity17 but it was their work rate that helped make sure @entity9 survived a furious second half onslaught			1
@entity11 and @entity12 both ran 8.2 miles in the 90 minutes – putting them jointly into second place behind @entity24 's @entity23 for the furthest distance covered by any @entity5 player this season			1
@entity9 's @entity11 ( left ) ran 8.2 miles as his side defeated @entity17 2 - 1 on sunday afternoon @entity9 star @entity12 ( centre ) covered the same amount of ground as @entity11 at the @entity32 2			1
@entity33 missing a couple of gilt - edged chances at @entity36 might be a sign that he 's suffering from carrying the weight of @entity40 's attacking hopes without @entity41 or @entity42			1
the @entity44 winger celebrated his 20th birthday only last week but is being asked to do a more experienced player 's job			2
amid all the chopping and changing by @entity49 in search of a winning formula , @entity33 has missed only one game , and only twice has he not been in the starting @entity53 since the start of the @entity55 he has now started 24 matches , only one less than he did in the whole of the last domestic season			1
@entity33 endured a difficult game as @entity40 went down 3 - 0 to @entity60 at @entity36 3			1
@entity61 is trying to change @entity63 's game plan to a more patient possession style – keeper @entity65 was passing goal kicks to his full backs @entity68 and @entity69 standing near the corner flags			2
the new tactics are a work in progress as the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity75 proved – but it did mean that even with 10 men , @entity63 hit more passes ( 438 ) than they 've managed in all but two of their previous @entity5 away games this season			0
@entity63 attempted more passes against @entity75 than in all but two of their away games this season 4			0
even after scoring 22 goals last season @entity87 fans remain divided about @entity91 's quality , but his strike rate this injury - hit year tells its own story			1
two goals against @entity95 took him to five for the season in all competitions from just 460 minutes on the pitch – a goal every 92 minutes			1
new hero @entity101 has needed 136 minutes each for the 13 he has scored			2
@entity91 scored twice in @entity87 's 4 - 1 win against @entity95 to continue his fine form in front of goal 5			1
@entity107 goalscorer @entity106 had to wait for his @entity5 chance but the 25 - year - old is making the most of it now			0
the 1 - 0 win over @entity113 was his seventh start and @entity116 's side have taken 12 points from those games			0
the forward who began his career playing part - time football for @entity122 near his @entity124 home is making a difference with his work rate – he was involved in 24 duels for the ball against @entity113 , the second highest of any player in saturday 's top flight games			0
@entity107 striker @entity106 celebrates after scoring his side 's winner against @entity113 at @entity133 6			0
@entity134 's days as a @entity136 regular looked numbered with the 32 - year - old club captain left on the bench for six weeks after recovering from injury			1
but @entity141 's return to fitness has given him a new lease of life – the 1 - 1 draw at @entity146 was his third start in a row			1
@entity149 and @entity141 has also helped @entity150 get more chance to be effective – between them they found the @entity44 winger 13 times with passes			2
@entity136 skipper @entity134 ( right ) has found a new lease of life with @entity141 back in the starting xi 7			1
it could be a long january for @entity160 when @entity161 is away at the @entity162 with the @entity163			0
the 25 - year - old winger 's tricks and flicks have an end product – the 63 crosses he has now put over is getting on for twice that of any other @entity171 player			0
he 's fourth in the @entity5 charts for most crosses – three ahead of @entity60 's @entity174			1
( @entity113 's @entity175 is top by a distance with 114 )			0
@entity160 winger @entity161 has delivered 63 crosses this season - the fourth highest of any player 8			0
just when things were settling down at @entity181 , owner @entity179 is heading for another fall - out with the club 's supporters			1
the @entity186 billionaire , who changed the club 's shirt from blue to red , has now sanctioned a new away kit in all white with red trimmings			2
they wore it for the first time in the 5 - 3 defeat at @entity196 , with the rather spurious claim that it was because they thought their normal blue change gear would clash with red and black stripes			0
but the suspicion among die - hard fans is that superstitious @entity179 , who believes red is a lucky colour , will now have the opportunity to consign the colour blue to the club 's history books			1
@entity181 's @entity209 ( right ) helped debut his side 's controversial new white and red kit against @entity196 9			2
teenage sensation @entity212 is not letting his forthcoming £ 1.75million move to @entity17 stop him performing at the top of his game for @entity217			2
the 19 - year - old , whose pay packet will jump from £ 500 to £ 10,000 per week when he joins the @entity220 in january , could have hid against @entity221 to make sure injury did n't wreck his big move			0
instead he made one goal and scored the other as the @entity226 won 2 - 0 to move into the @entity228 play - off places			2
@entity217 youngster @entity212 , pictured in action earlier this season , is set to join @entity17 in january 10			2
former @entity232 defender @entity231 is facing his first big crisis since starting his management career in charge of @entity236 after watching his team ship four goals at home to @entity240			0
the 48 - year - old , whose previous coaching experience was all with the club 's youth system , has to find a way to pick up a side who let in six at @entity250 the week before			0
he 's not helped himself by publicly questioning the commitment of his players			0
@entity236 boss @entity231 has questioned the commitment of his players as they struggle in @entity253			0

@entity12 and @entity11 both covered 8.2 miles against @entity17
@entity40 's @entity33 struggled up front against @entity60
@entity91 has scored a goal every 92 minutes for @entity87 this season
@entity134 is back in *favour* at @entity136 with @entity141 in the team
@entity179 seems to be trying to ditch blue altogether at @entity181
