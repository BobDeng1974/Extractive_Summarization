@entity1 , 42 , described as a ' narcissistic psychopath ' , mounted a chilling hate campaign after being dumped by 35 - year - old doctor @entity14 , from @entity15 , @entity16			2

but their relationship soured after airlifted dr @entity14 ’s mother , @entity33 , and stepfather , @entity29 voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past			2
the couple split after a year , triggering a four - month stalking campaign by @entity1 during which he tried to burn down the family home in @entity42 and hired a private investigator to snoop on her			1
@entity44 heard @entity1 had a ‘ deliberate and chilling degree of planning ’ in sending poison pen letters to dr @entity14 ’s colleagues and neighbours			2
he also set fire to her parents ’ home and was eventually found with a cache of weapons including a crossbow in what prosecutor @entity57 claimed was an attempt to ‘ abduct ’ dr @entity14			1
@entity1 , a @entity59 national who came to @entity60 in 2009 , was arrested by armed police in april last year while impersonating a doctor at @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 less than two hours before dr @entity14 was due to start work			0
the previous day he had gained access to the maternity ward where he quizzed her colleagues about her rota before returning the next day with a loaded crossbow and a large knife			1
the court heard how due to mr @entity29 working in the defence systems industry , he is required to tell his employers about any changes in his family ’s circumstances			1
doomed : @entity1 met @entity14 , through an elite online dating agency but their relationship soured after her family voiced concern over lies they had uncovered about his past through his own inquiries and those of his employer , it emerged that @entity1 had lied about his past			1
he falsely claimed that he was 35 , an orphan and had lived in @entity60 for several years			0

his lies led to him being suspended from his job in december 2010 and in the same month dr @entity14 , 37 , decided to end their relationship			0
the court heard that @entity1 ’s behaviour turned increasingly erratic			0
he at first refused to move out of her home , forcing dr @entity14 ’s relatives to evict him			1
on april 1 last year , mr @entity29 and mrs @entity14 went on holiday to @entity23 , with only a few friends and family knowing where they were heading			1

he was charged with offences related to discharging the weapons and freed on bail , a decision described by detectives as ' regrettable ”			0
stash : when police swooped on @entity1 's van , they found details of where his ex-girlfriend worked , as well as a hoard of weapons days later , while mrs @entity14 and mr @entity29 were still on @entity23 , he torched their thatched cottage 220 miles away in @entity42			1
after dousing newspapers with petrol , he set fires by the front and back doors , but no - one was hurt , although people were asleep in neighbouring homes			1
but in a fit of frustration at seeing his ex-girlfriend ’s family home surrounded by police , he drove to a nearby police station at wing instead and tried to burn it down			1
@entity1 was sentenced on nine counts , including two of harassment , arson reckless as to endangering life , theft and possession of an offensive weapon			0
he was also found guilty of perverting the course of justice after sending letters while in custody to dr @entity14 threatening suicide			0
he was jailed indefinitely for public protection and must serve a minimum of six years before he can be considered for parole , @entity44 heard			0
chilling : one of the two crossbows discovered by police judge @entity171 said : ‘ @entity172 wanted your relationship to end , but you could not accept that			0
‘ you harassed her bombarded her with texts , calls and cards and when her mother uncovered the extent of your lies to her you set about harassing her			2
’ ‘ you sent letters to her employers and then your criminal acts became more sinister and serious and you took items precious to @entity14			0
’ judge @entity171 said @entity1 was ‘ cool and calculated ’ when he attempted to set fire to the family ’s home in @entity194 , @entity42 in april 2011 and that he had a ‘ total disregard ’ for the safety of others			1
the court heard @entity1 was seen by psychologists from @entity200 while in custody who described him as ‘ narcissistic ’ and stated he presented the traits of a ‘ rejected stalker ’			0
he was described as ‘ articulate and intelligent ’ but was felt to present a ‘ high risk ’ of reoffending			0
defence barrister @entity207 claimed that @entity1 now felt ‘ ashamed ’ and showed ‘ remorse ’ about his actions but this was disregarded by the judge who said he felt for @entity212 and her family who had to sit through the proceedings and give ‘ distressing ’ evidence			2
tools : a police photograph shows a blowtorch and other items that were discovered in the back of @entity1 's specially adapted van speaking after the sentencing dr @entity14 ’s step - father @entity29 criticised the @entity225 and @entity226 for allowing @entity1 into the country when he had a previous conviction in @entity59 for aggravated assault			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ mr @entity1 harassed this family and when he did n’t get his way he made three attempts to take our lives			2
‘ this case has shown yet again the current deficiencies in our border controls			0
‘ mr @entity1 should never have been allowed into this country			2
‘ in discovering his conviction in @entity59 we informed the @entity225 of the threat he posed to us			1
‘ they ignored our pleas			0
even now the @entity60 has no way to stop mr @entity1 from re-entering the country			2
‘ it is time the government took security of its citizens seriously			0
