@entity3 chairman @entity2 chose one of the most prestigious cricket occasions of the year , the @entity1 launch , to make a complete fool of himself			1
@entity2 , despite his standing as one of world cricket ’s big powerbrokers who will continue with his deputy chairmanship of the @entity12 , embarrassed vip guests with his astonishing behaviour at the @entity16 dinner			1
@entity2 arrived upset that the new @entity18 regime had just sacked his @entity18 managing director appointment , @entity20 , whom he had rashly called a ‘ man of great judgment ’			1
departing @entity18 chairman @entity2 made a fool of himself during the @entity1 launch @entity2 confronted guest speaker @entity26 and @entity28 's @entity27 during the dinner he was further annoyed that @entity27 ’s @entity1 editor notes had been scathing of the way the @entity18 on @entity2 ’s watch had botched the axing of @entity34 while operating a ‘ nexus of self - preservation ’			1
and @entity2 finally lost the plot when eloquent guest speaker @entity26 of @entity39 , the former president of @entity12 , outlined his understandable concern for the future of world cricket as a result of the financial and power carve - up by @entity2 ’s @entity18 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
after @entity26 had finished speaking @entity2 loudly harangued @entity1 editor @entity27 across the table — in front of @entity18 all - rounder @entity50 , former fast bowler @entity51 and @entity18 chief executive @entity52			1
@entity18 cricketer @entity50 witnessed the incident at the @entity16 dinner @entity2 was furious @entity26 ’s ‘ disgraceful ’ address had made no mention of @entity12 ’s @entity58 contingency fund and also had strong objections to @entity1 ’s opinions			1
yet @entity2 had been granted a two - page platform in last year ’s almanack to explain his @entity12 strategy			0
@entity2 then confronted @entity26 about his speech and had another go at @entity66 before storming out of the @entity16 in high dudgeon			0
@entity26 said : ‘ i ’m very used to @entity2 being utterly irrational			0
he always thinks it ’s just about him when there ’s a far bigger picture of three countries sharing 52 per cent of income between them			0
’ to complete the farce , @entity2 ’s nomination was supported by the @entity18 board on thursday for him to become the first @entity18 president			2
@entity81 ban @entity79 for @entity82 @entity83 have refused to allow their pundit @entity79 to present @entity85 with his record 20th champion jump jockey title at @entity87 on april 25 , where the great @entity82 could ride for the last time			1
racing officials had asked @entity79 , who immediately agreed due to the esteem @entity85 is held in by fellow sportsmen and because he is a big @entity92 fan to boot			0
but @entity81 have withdrawn @entity79 because the race meeting is being broadcast on @entity94			2
a @entity81 spokesman said the @entity79 approach had not been made through the right channels			0
@entity83 pundit @entity79 ( centre ) will not be allowed to appear on @entity94 's racing coverage @entity79 had agreed to present @entity92 supporter jockey @entity85 with his 20th champion jump jockey title @entity103 is snubbing the @entity104 to present the women ’s @entity105 on @entity107			1
and after a @entity110 farewell , @entity108 do n’t expect to work with @entity103 again			0
they believe she is now more focused on writing books , with a children ’s fiction story her next commission			0
presenter @entity103 will present the women 's @entity105 on @entity107 rather than the @entity104 with even former @entity18 batting coach @entity120 saying the @entity34 camp had wiped the floor with the @entity18 in the pr battle over @entity34 ’s banishment , it was depressing that new ceo @entity52 shows no sign of being more helpful with the media			1
when asked for a word as he left the @entity1 dinner about his earlier axing of @entity20 , he refused to break stride , merely stating : ‘ we ’ve said all we want to say			1
’ the @entity52 regime have promised to stop leaks coming out of @entity134 ’s , yet @entity83 had a satellite truck and reporter in position at @entity138 for the unexpected @entity140 announcement and a correspondent ready to report live from @entity142			0
@entity20 has left his role as managing director of @entity18 @entity146 - winning @entity18 captains @entity147 and @entity148 are the obvious choices for the newly created job of director of @entity18 after the sacking of @entity20			2
but the @entity18 work in mysterious ways , such as paying for @entity155 , the @entity18 performance director , to go on the part - time masters course in sporting directorship at @entity159 ’s @entity158 which @entity160 coach @entity2 is also on			2
@entity147 ( right ) and @entity148 ( left ) are among the contenders to replace @entity20			0
