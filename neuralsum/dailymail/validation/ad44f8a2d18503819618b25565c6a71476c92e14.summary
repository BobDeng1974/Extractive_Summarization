playing again : @entity0 says years of loud music shattered his hearing musician @entity0 first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band @entity5 more than 30 years ago			1
‘ i was in my hotel room one night , and i ’d turned the tv off , but could still hear a high - pitched whiney sound , ’ he says			0
‘ i wondered where it was coming from , looked all around the room , opened the windows , and then figured that it might just be tinnitus			1
’ this was in 1981 , and back then few , if any , musicians wore earplugs when they played live			0
‘ the yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound , ’ says @entity0			1
besides , a lot of musicians — not to mention young fans — saw temporary hearing loss after a gig as something of a badge of honour			0
‘ back then , it was a case of “ oh , it must have been a great gig , my ears are still ringing ” , ’ says @entity0 , who first found fame as a bass guitarist with @entity31 before going on to join @entity5 and then later working with former @entity33 ! star @entity32			1
tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , according to the @entity41			1
many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise , be it in industry , the armed forces or the music business			1
last month , the @entity50 said people should listen to music for no more than an hour a day , to prevent damage to their hearing			2
tinnitus can also be triggered by conditions such as @entity58 ’s disease , or in older people it can occur as a result of age - related hearing loss			2
sufferers experience a constant whirring or whistling in their ears and many struggle to find an effective treatment			0
at first @entity0 , now 56 , experienced ‘ a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear , a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up			1
’ it was worse after gigs , but it would come and go , until one night in 1995 while @entity0 was on stage with captain @entity78 ( who topped the charts with his cover of @entity81 in the @entity82 )			1
‘ there was this deafening screech of feedback , so loud that it physically knocked me several feet back , ’ he says			2
‘ i ran off before the next song and stuffed toilet paper in my ears , but the damage had been done			0
’ afterwards any sudden noise — doors banging , car breaks , shouting — would make him jump			0
back home in @entity94 , @entity0 ’s doctor referred him to a specialist at the @entity96 , who diagnosed ‘ high - frequency hearing loss ’ after acoustic trauma , and advised him to limit his exposure to noise — and to get a new career			1
but for @entity0 , being a musician was more than a job			1
‘ it was my life			0
so i carried on for a couple more years			2
’ however , the tinnitus gradually worsened			1
‘ it was exacerbated by extraneous noises i had no control over , such as knives on plates , glasses clinking , children shouting — and i was hugely stressed			0
’ tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , with many suffering from hearing damage by 1997 , @entity0 had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career			1
he returned to the hospital and was prescribed maskers — a hearing aid - type device that played a hissing noise in his ears , now more commonly known as white noise generators			0
‘ we were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus — it was a distraction technique , ’ says @entity128 , a senior audiologist at the hospital , who has been treating @entity0 since the mid-nineties			1
@entity0 was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year			1
‘ but i could n’t follow conversations or hear the television properly , because i had great big pieces of plastic in each ear , ’ he says			0
by now , even the click of a light switch aggravated his condition			2
‘ i pretty much became a recluse for the next few years , which contributed to my divorce , ’ he says			2
in the @entity147 was referred for counselling with a clinical psychologist , but this did n’t work			0
he turned to alternative treatments , from the @entity151 ( a method of relaxation ) to acupuncture			0
at one stage he tried ‘ laser pen therapy ’ — shining a torch into your ear to stimulate the growth of hair cells in the inner ear , as tinnitus has been linked to damaged hair cells			2
‘ you name it , i threw money at it , but they were all useless , ’ says @entity0 , who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son @entity167 had friends round to play			1
nowadays , one of the most common treatments is cognitive behavioural therapy — a psychotherapeutic approach that tries to get the patient to change how they think about tinnitus			2
while this was some help , @entity0 concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition			1
he carries custom - fitted maximum protection earplugs ‘ which keep the frequencies down and cuts external noise by about 25 decibels ’			0
basic sets can be bought from most music shops , while @entity191 charges between £ 50 and £ 100 for a made - to - measure pair			2
@entity0 also avoids noisy places as , like for many sufferers , background noise makes the problem worse			1
‘ if i ’m in a pub or restaurant i always try to position myself against the wall , so i only have sound coming from one direction , ’ he says			0
there have been some advances in treatments since @entity0 was first diagnosed — such as the introduction of smaller ‘ in - ear ’ white noise generators , and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one			1
@entity0 has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music a new treatment , neuromodulation — an earplug - type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual — is available privately , but is still undergoing trials			1
recently , researchers at the @entity220 said they ’d identified a drug that blocks ‘ hyperactivity ’ in the area of the brain that processes sound — although they are yet to test the effect in humans			0
meanwhile , @entity0 is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music			1
‘ we run a scheme called the musician ’s @entity233 , which gives comprehensive tests and advice on hearing protection by an audiologist , ’ he says			2
‘ often when i ask students to raise their hands if their ears have ever rung , eight out of ten will put their hands up			0
these kids are 18 , 19 years old , and do n’t realise the damage that ’s already been done			0
‘ there ’s still the attitude that i had , that noise is fun and that “ if it ’s too loud , you ’re too old ”			0
’ @entity0 , who has recorded a new album , a postcard from @entity253 , with his old bandmate captain @entity78 , is able to play again for up to an hour at a time , so long as he wears his earplugs			1
he says his father had always warned him being in a rock band would ‘ make me go deaf ’ but he had ignored him			0
‘ if i knew then how my life was going to be affected by noise damage — i ’m pretty deaf now — i would definitely have taken steps to protect myself			0
after all , a musician needs ears			0
they ’re pretty vital tools of the trade			0
