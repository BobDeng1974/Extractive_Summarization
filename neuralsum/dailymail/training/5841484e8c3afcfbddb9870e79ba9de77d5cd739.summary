from the horrors of the @entity2 to kamikaze attacks in the @entity4 , @entity0 inflicted terrible suffering on troops and civilians alike			2
but as these photos reveal , soldiers fighting the war , whether in the @entity11 or @entity12 , did enjoy some more light - hearted moments			2
hidden away in the attics of former servicemen for more than 60 years , the pictures , which show soldiers from the @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18 among others , shed fresh light on the friendships fostered between the men who fought			1
enjoying themselves : a group of soldiers indulge in an @entity28 ( and au naturel ) dip on a day off multi-tasking : a trio of @entity16 soldiers enjoy a convivial chat while cleaning up in a makeshift shower scrubbing up : a group of @entity16 soldiers enjoy a shower ( left ) while another takes a snooze ( right ( the photos , which appear in a new book , my buddy : @entity0 laid @entity43 , are drawn from an archive created by @entity46 based photographer , @entity45 , which contains more than 500 images of off - duty @entity0 soldiers			1
his extensive collection includes snapshots of soldiers and sailors from @entity17 , the @entity16 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , and the @entity18 , cavorting on the sand in the @entity4 , shivering in the snow of @entity12 , posing solo in the barracks , and in great happy groups			1
many are barely out of boyhood , at their physical peak and are responding to the reality of battle by living each day to the fullest			0
what 's more , as the photographs reveal , ' buddy ' relationships enjoyed by troops from all nations were an essential part of life on the front line - and even boosted soldiers ' ability to fight			0
having a splashing time : a group of solders pose for a photo during a lull in the fighting in the @entity4 oooh matron ! soldiers line up for a medical while another horses around and waves his bits at the camera according to @entity45 , commanders encouraged troops to form close relationships with one another , gaining , in the process , an important form of emotional support			1
many of these friendships survived the end of the war , with men forging close bonds as they fought - and relaxed - side by side			0
while some of the more risque photos might come as a shock , they do offer a glimpse of the lighter side of life on the front line			0
sadly , for many of the men enjoying a lazy day on the beach or macho fun in the barracks , these would be the last joyful moments of a life about to be cut short			0
