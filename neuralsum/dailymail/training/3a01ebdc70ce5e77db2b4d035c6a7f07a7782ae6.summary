the oldest motorboat still afloat in @entity1 , which was used in the @entity2 , at one time lay neglected in a @entity5 boatyard for 14 years - but it has now found its sea legs again after a major renovation			1
the wooden ' trials boat ' , which was snapped up for a mere £ 400 four years ago , has been lovingly restored to its former glory			1
it now has an estimated value 1,000 times that amount at £ 400,000			1
the 25ft - long vessel , believed to have been built by boatmakers @entity17 in 1902 , was purchased by and restored for transport collector @entity18			1
ship ahoy : the @entity20 was bought by collector @entity18 for £ 400 in 2009 and after renovation is worth £ 400,000 ' @entity20 ' , named by previous owner @entity22 in 1949 after joking to ' fix it or leave it ' , because it required so much restoration work back then , has a fascinating history			1
built in the early @entity29 , it is one of the oldest motorboats in the world and its current engine means it reaches at speeds of up to 18mph - the same as its heyday			1
amazingly , it is also the only boat to appear in all three royal pageants marking the @entity42 's coronation , silver and @entity44			1
three commemorative plaques are now screwed to the dashboard to mark this special achievement			2
further evidence confirms it was also used in the @entity2 - the only time power boat racing has ever featured at the event			2
during @entity20 's restoration , traces of ' @entity53 ' paint were found underneath the hull - the colour used for the @entity57			1
mr @entity18 , who is an engineer aged in his 60s , said : ' it 's the oldest power boat in @entity1 - there are other boats around , but they 're not still afloat			1
' it has no flat surfaces on the hull or on the deck and this helps give us the date			0
' it also has holes for tow ropes , which is a sign of an @entity74 trial boat as these were the only ones which had them			0
' sporting history : during renovation , it was discovered that the boat had taken part in the 1908 olympics shipshape : the boat is back to its former glory , but at one time it lay neglected in a @entity5 boatyard for 14 years the oldest motorboat still afloat in @entity1 is also the only one to feature in the three royal pageants marking the @entity42 's coronation , silver and @entity44 today , ' @entity20 ' is fitted with a 1950 's @entity90 1500cc 4 cylinder sports car engine			1
originally , the boat would have had a rather more basic petrol unit used in aircraft , but they were very heavy in comparison to their power output			0
the unreliable engine propellers were not replaced until the @entity99 , when they developed as lighter , efficient engines used in aircraft			0
eventually the technology trickled down to boats			0
rediscovered and restored , the @entity20 was reunited with former owner @entity105 of @entity106 at this year 's @entity108 rally , where it won the @entity110			1
her late husband @entity111 , who named it @entity20 , bought it in 1949 from an army officer stationed abroad			1
back then the boat had been sitting in a garden in @entity117 for at least ten years and was without an engine			0
@entity111 named her @entity20 after an old @entity121 joke - " fix it or leave it " - because it required so much work			1
the couple would cruise on inland waterways and the upper @entity5 and together they owned her until selling @entity20 in 1995			1
it then remained in the yard until @entity132 of @entity133 bought it in july 2009 at the @entity135 for mr @entity18 , who lives in @entity136			1
@entity137 , a boatbuilder for @entity132 , spotted the vessel near the company 's exhibition tent			1
it was not long before he realised the ship 's potential			2
@entity145 lot of love : the @entity20 would have disintegrated further without the much - needed renovation work rock bottom : the @entity20 in its pre-renovated state clues on board : @entity18 knew this was a high - quality boat by looking at the craftmanship and lightweight construction , which are indicative of a racing boat he said : ' i looked at it and realised it was an interesting hull			1
i thought " this could be quite special "			0
' the £ 400 purchase , from @entity164 's boatbuilders yard in @entity165 exhibiting at the rally , has proved a shrewd investment			1
according to mr @entity18 , the clues were in the fixings on the mahogany hull planks , which were carefully doubled up , which is a sign of high quality craftmanship			2
it also had a lightweight construction , a detail which indicated it is a racing boat			0
mr @entity137 contacted the @entity176 on the @entity177 , which first identified the hull as a classic @entity180 racing yacht design			0
the original seat position and special connection points for tow ropes located on board tied in with the appearance of early racing trials boats			0
these were raced in the first - ever @entity189 international @entity188 in 1903 , which pitted wooden powerboats against each other			2
it was @entity17 who built the majority of early wooden racers for trials racing - and @entity20 's build matches those used in the first event			1
the distinctive curved ' @entity202 ' structure of the hull is typical of early @entity205 racers used in the event			0
@entity207 club secretary @entity206 said the curved design for the hull , also known as ' hard chine ' , was common for early racing boats			0
he said : ' hard chine hulls rise up to ' plane ' on the surface of the water , thereby reducing the boat 's resistance and increasing its speed			2
' the @entity219 still exists today for modern powerboats , but they now reach speeds of around 100mph			0
@entity222 , 63 , @entity223 for the @entity224 , said : ' the boat is absolutely stunning			0
' i 've never seen anything that old restored to such a beautiful standard			0
' it 's very typical of the boats from the early 1900s			2
' the @entity231 are fanatical about this sort of boat , but this is one of the best			0
' in its heyday : the @entity20 was built with a classic state - of - the - art 1900 racing yacht design mr @entity18 did n't disclose how much he had spent on the restoration , but says it was worth every penny given its current value			1
mr @entity137 said : ' i have been quoted by @entity245 experts that it could make half a million dollars			0
' the figure derives from price comparisons with other wooden motorboats being sold at @entity245 auctions			0
according to mr @entity137 , the most valuable are those built before the @entity99			0
another early powerboat from 1912 is still on the water on the @entity177 , but lacks the history of @entity20			2
and a similar @entity256 motorboat from the same era is held at the @entity258 in @entity259 , @entity231 , but no longer floats			2
its condition has deteriorated massively in comparison to the @entity20 , and it no longer sits on the water			2
mr @entity137 said : ' they described it to me and said it was in deep storage , which i think basically means it is a pile of wood on the floor			0

@entity20 is the oldest motorboat still afloat in @entity1
it was bought for £ 400 by collector @entity18 in 2009 , but following restoration is now worth £ 400,000
previous owner @entity22 named it after joking to ' fix it or leave it '
the 25ft - long vessel is the only one to have appeared in all three royal pageants marking the @entity42 's coronation , silver and @entity44
