sometimes life imitates art , but apparently not when it comes to the @entity3			1
current and former female agents spoke out to the @entity5 on sunday to renounce depictions of @entity3 women on tv shows and in movies			1
the group of women say they are nothing like the honey - pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown @entity18 with booze and pills			1
retired @entity3 officer @entity21 , 69 , who helped expose her colleague @entity22 as a @entity24 double agent , says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like @entity29			1
' i wish they would n’t use centerfold models in tight clothes			2
we do n’t look that way			2
and we do n’t act that way , ' @entity21 told the @entity5			1
in the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a @entity57 military base in @entity58 , actress @entity52 plays @entity59 as a ' giddy ' agent , excitedly baking a @entity62 source a cake for their meeting on his birthday			1
as in real life , @entity59 dies as the agent gets out of his car and detonates a suicide vest			2
' the problem is that they portray most women in such a one - dimensional way ; whatever the character flaw is , that ’s all they are , ' @entity70 said			1
' it can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function , how we relate to men , how we engage in national security - that is pretty off			1
' one of the fictional @entity3 agents currently on screen is @entity86 on @entity88 's state of affairs			1
played by @entity89 , @entity86 is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar , sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist			1
another example is @entity96 's @entity95 ( played by @entity97 ) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child ( the product of a secret relationship with a double agent ) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex			1
a retired covert officer identified as @entity108 says sex is n't a major part of the spy game			0
offensive : veteran @entity3 analyst @entity44 says she was upset with the ' giddy ' portrayal of her friend @entity50 ( left ) in the movie @entity51 ( played by @entity52 , right )			1
@entity59 , in real life as in the movie , was killed by a suicide bomber at an @entity58 military base in 2009 ' let ’s not kid ourselves			0
for me , working in the @entity123 , there ’s a lot of attraction for @entity123 men for @entity129 women			2
i do n’t mean necessarily sexually ... but curiosity , if nothing else			0
and we certainly have played that			0
' however , @entity108 says she more often has to put men in their place while doing her work			0
' you need to remove [ sex ] off the table very quickly and clearly			0
sometimes it ’s " get your hands off my knee or i ’m going to break it , " or you put as many people into the room as you can , ' she said			0
while the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated , the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives			1
it 's not about sex : the real women of the @entity3 say they are not all honey - pots who use their sexuality to control sources ( like @entity95 on @entity96 , played by @entity97 above ) sending the wrong message : the women also take issue with @entity88 show state of affairs , which features @entity89 ( above ) as a troubled @entity3 analyst ' i briefed @entity166 while in labor			1
i ’d tell her about the global jihad and then i would turn away and breathe			0
when these two worlds clash , they clash really hard , ' @entity70 said			0
@entity70 says that the concerns of her job are so important , that it 's hard to come home and sympathize with the minor dramas ruling her teenager 's life			2
' i deal with people who are trying to kill lots of people in horrendous , painful ways			0
so i have a wall ; it ’s really tall			0
unfortunately , though , what happens with time is you ca n’t click it on or off			0
you just block the sensation of feeling , ' @entity70 said			0
' i ’m no longer married because of my wall			0
so i have five kids whose parents are n’t together because i constructed that wall over time and did n’t know how to get through it , ' @entity70 added			0
many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency , which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in @entity203 and flexible time off			1
which is good because @entity70 thinks women naturally make great agents			2
' women do n’t think more intuitively than men , but we tend to trust our own gut less			2
we are not going to put all our money in one basket , ' she said .			0
