‘ the natural state of reproduction requires a state of utter and complete frankness that must be observed between the married pair , ’ suggested one contemporary writer			2
‘ there must be no private reserves on the wedding night , and each one must allow their soul to be as open as their arms			2
’ other relationship - enhancing tips included the advice that passion is increased by time spent apart , and that even decent women should use a little rouge , enamel or powder , plus some ‘ pencilling of the eyebrows and darkening stuff for the lids ’			1
@entity26 vintage postcard from 1909 , showing a loving couple kissing at piano - people of the @entity30 era might have been a lot more ' sexually minded ' than we previously thought those with small breasts were advised that a little judicious padding might not go amiss — with the proviso that if they began this deception with a suitor before marriage , they should be prepared for him to be disappointed on the wedding night			1
like their 21st - century counterparts , @entity30 commentators worried about the legalisation of the sex industry , the ethics and availability of contraception and the horrors of human trafficking and child prostitution			1
but , writes @entity56 , if the 19th century abounded with attitudes that we can readily identify with , our forebears also espoused many ideas that now seem utterly alien			2
among the most significant of these , she suggests , is the @entity30 fear of the dangers involved with what they euphemistically called the practice of ‘ the solitary vice ’			1
the @entity66 neurologist @entity65 had published his influential @entity67 in 1760 , in which he suggested that the consequences of masturbation included insanity or even death			2
a commonly held belief during the @entity30 era was that a woman could become pregnant only if she experienced an orgasm at the same time as her lover more than 100 years later , @entity65 ’s theories were still widely believed , with the fear of ‘ the solitary vice ’ dominating @entity30 marriage guides and advice on morals and manners			1
one well - known author on the subject was @entity87 , creator of the cornflake			2
those tempted to indulge , it was suggested , should avoid mustard , pepper , rich gravy , beer , wine , cider and tobacco , all of which created a craving for sensual gratification			2
rather than risk the consequences of ‘ the solitary vice ’ , those in possession of 100 guineas could purchase a ‘ femme de voyage ’ or inflatable sex aid , for the ‘ special use of gentlemen on their travels ’			1
these ingenious contraptions could be packed up and stored under a gentleman ’s hat , and were also ‘ a highly successful alternative to those who fear contamination or pollution from illicit acts with questionable lovers ’			2
another commonly held and erroneous belief was the notion that a woman could become pregnant only if she experienced an orgasm at the same time as her lover			2
without this , the female seed could not be released and no child would be formed in her womb			2
furthermore , at the conclusion of the sexual act , the wife must not talk , cough or sneeze , lest this impede conception			0
old texts said that those looking to have children should remember that ' sex must not be faintly or drowsily performed ' in 1845 , the @entity142 physician @entity141 , in his book @entity144 : an @entity146 , in @entity145 , took this argument to its supposed logical conclusion and argued that since the ‘ fecundating principle ’ would not enter the womb unless a woman craved it do so , ‘ a rape can never be productive of real offspring ’			1
he also propounded the view that ‘ the party , whose temperament predominates in the child , was in the highest state of orgasm at the period of intercourse ’			0
crucially , any union without true love , according to the manuals of the day , would bring forth ‘ ill - looking , sour and spiritless offspring ’ , while those hoping for good - looking children should remember that sex must not be ‘ faintly or drowsily performed ’			1
intriguingly , though , babies conceived during the daytime often turned out both ‘ fine and handsome ’			0
conversely , women were cautioned that ‘ a child that was begat upon a set of stair is most likely to be born with a crooked back and given in no small way to the fault of staring ’			0
and if the husband was unfaithful , children he sired were likely to be ‘ weak and wretched ’ and grow up unhappy			1
as if all this were n’t enough for the beleaguered @entity30 matron to take in , further gems of advice unearthed by @entity56 ’s researches include the suggestion that children who were conceived in spring and summer could be expected to have darker complexions than those conceived in autumn and winter			1
similarly , children ‘ begat when the wind is blowing from the north ’ would tend to be stronger than those conceived during an easterly wind			1
an illegitimate child , on the other hand , would be full of ‘ fire and energy ’			0
despite popular depictions of ' subservient ' women in the @entity30 era , the century was full of strong , energetic women excelling in the fields of literary and scientific endeavour , or campaigning to improve conditions for their sex this was evidence ( albeit hypocritical in view of the @entity213 ’ moral code ) of the passions which engulfed its parents at the time of conception			1
on the subject of choosing a partner , a wealth of advice — some of it downright bizarre — was available to young men and women of the period			1
no man , for example , should marry a woman with a nose similar to his own			0
women with @entity235 , or hooked , noses should not marry at all — or else find a small - nosed husband			0
not only this , but potential suitors should remember to check skin tone , body shape , chin , height and size of feet			0
a broad and square chin was thought to be indicative of a jealous nature , while a long chin proved grace and humility			0
big - footed men and women , although awkward on first meeting , made the most reliable partners , while small - footed people were deemed prone to reckless gaiety			0
the plump were renowned for their affable and easy nature			0
those with sharp and angular forms were energetic and earnest and prone to find fault with the indolence of others			0
tall people were thought to have the most self - control , while short people were the opposite , hence their frequent appearance in riotous mobs			0
gentlemen were advised that the easiest way to choose their future intended was to be guided by the shape of her legs			0
sturdy legs with a neat ankle were thought the most suitable for a man who wanted an intellectual companion			0
heavy legs and coarse shoes were regarded as indicative of a coarse nature , while thin yet muscular pins were best for a gentleman who wanted his home run with military precision			0
once marriage was finally in prospect , couples were counselled to bear in mind that a warm climate made people feel sexier — an important factor when planning the honeymoon , or wedding tour			0
later , however , when the stresses and strains of family life began to show , gentlemen were reminded by one author that ‘ hysterical wives or children should be laid on a waterproof sheet on the floor and doused with a jug of cold water			1
’ the idea of such dominant men and submissive wives is , on the whole , suggests @entity56 , not a representative one			0
in reality , she says , the century was full of strong , energetic women excelling in the fields of literary and scientific endeavour , or campaigning to improve conditions for their sex			1
while much of the advice given out at the time was misguided and inaccurate , the 19th - century tenets of true love , respect and mutual physical pleasure are , she believes , as relevant today as they were 150 years ago			1
and for their timeless and illuminating advice on how to conduct a successful sexual relationship — along with a wealth of architecture , engineering , art and literature — we have a lot to thank the @entity213 for			1
