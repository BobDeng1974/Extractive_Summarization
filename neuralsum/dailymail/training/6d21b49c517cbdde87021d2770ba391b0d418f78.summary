the self - proclaimed @entity1 ’s toughest sheriff was struck a humbling blow wednesday when a judge ruled his @entity6 , @entity5 office will get a court appointed monitor after they lost a racial profiling suit in may			1
@entity11 ’s ultra-tough stance on immigration was at the heart of the lawsuit that alleged his office detained @entity16 for unreasonably long periods			2
the federal judge also ordered the creation of a community advisory board to ensure the @entity22 area sheriff is respecting his @entity24 constituents ’ constitutional rights			1
while @entity11 ’s enemies have cheered the ruling , the 81 - year - old responded with characteristic defiance			1
‘ we are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal , ’ he said			0
‘ to be clear , the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations			1
’ ' @entity1 's toughest sheriff ' : @entity6 , @entity5 sheriff @entity11 will get a court order as part of the fall out from a may ruling that his office engaged in the racial profiling of @entity16 @entity1 district judge @entity42 found in may that the @entity43 and sheriff @entity11 singled out @entity16 and deputies unreasonably prolonged detentions			1
it was the first finding by a court that the agency covering @entity5 's most populous county engages in racial profiling after a small group of @entity16 sued the sheriff 's office for violating their constitutional rights , saying they were being detained simply because of their race			1
the @entity59 , which is working on behalf of the plaintiffs , hailed the ruling as a victory			0
‘ today 's order is really going to put some sunlight into the corners of the @entity43 that have been such a problem in terms of people 's civil rights			0
it 's a great day , ’ said @entity59 lawyer @entity64 ’s lawyers were less thrilled			0
@entity11 has become nationally known for his unapologetic rejection of @entity74 era immigration policy and self - proclaimed status as @entity1 's toughest sheriff ' ca n't tell us what to do ' : @entity11 critics won a big prize when the sheriff 's office lost a may racial profiling case			1
the defiant sheriff her responded to appointment of a court babysitter with characteristic gall @entity87 : @entity11 has a penchant for grabbing headlines			2
in the wake of the @entity91 , @entity93 school shootings he enlisted action star @entity95 for a program to train children in self defense lawyer @entity99 said he was still reviewing the order , but noted he was ‘ pleased with its very moderate sensible tone			0
’ ‘ the sheriff is still in exclusive charge of the @entity43 , ’ @entity99 said , adding their concern all along was that the monitor would have too much authority			2
‘ the monitor can not tell us what to do or not to do , ’ @entity99 said , referring to the monitor 's role in the ruling as overseeing training and procedures , among other things			0
‘ the court will make the ultimate decision on whether or not the @entity43 is in compliance with its order , and we 're very pleased with that			0
’ the judge 's order also mandates that the sheriff 's office install audio and video recording devices in patrol vehicles and requires deputies to notify dispatch of the reason they are making a traffic stop prior to contacting the vehicle 's driver ‘ unless exigent circumstances make it unsafe or impracticable			1
@entity11 's attorneys had resisted the latter , telling the judge such an added measure would be burdensome and risky for deputies			2
' i am in the process of discussing it with our attorneys , ' @entity11 said			0
' we are identifying areas that are ripe for appeal			0
to be clear , the appointed monitor will have no veto authority over my duties or operations			1
' stats do n't lie : immigrants who were in the country illegally accounted for 57 percent of the 1,500 people arrested in the 20 ' crime suppression ' sweeps conducted by @entity11 's office since january 2008 ‘ that 's an area that we remain concerned about , ’ @entity99 said wednesday			1
@entity42 's ruling does n't altogether bar @entity11 from enforcing the state 's immigration laws , but it does impose a long list of restrictions on the sheriff 's patrols , some of which focused heavily on @entity24 areas in the county			1
the ruling prohibited the selection of ‘ particular communities , locations or geographic areas for targeted traffic enforcement based to any degree on the racial or ethnic composition of the community			0
’ the order also prohibits using race as a factor in deciding whether to stop a vehicle with a @entity24 occupant or detaining @entity24 passengers only on the suspicion that they 're in the country illegally			0
the @entity189 filed a similar lawsuit last year that also alleges racial profiling by @entity11 's office			2
its suit , however , claims broader civil rights violations , such as allegations that @entity11 's agency retaliates against its critics and punishes @entity24 jail inmates with limited @entity199 skills for speaking @entity200			2
@entity11 has denied the claims .			0

81 - year - old @entity11 will have a monitor as his staff are *retrained* to be better *attuned* to the constitutional rights of @entity24 residents of @entity5 's @entity6
the @entity22 area sheriff 's office was found in may to have violated @entity16 ' rights with prolonged detentions
' no veto authority over my duties or operations ' : @entity217 says he intends to appeal
