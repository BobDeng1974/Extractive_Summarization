sweat sprays off @entity29 ( right ) as @entity31 collects his jaw with a strong left in 1971 @entity29 and @entity31 at @entity32 , @entity33 , on march 8 , 1971 , was the second ' @entity28 ' @entity29 's evasive abilities and speed , such as this swerve from a @entity31 hook , kept him in the fight @entity50 ’ @entity31 was the undefeated two - belt champion but it was this proud black man ’s bizarre adoption by @entity54 ’s conservative right which stoked the fires of society still further			1
@entity29 had been banned from boxing for three - and - a - half years for refusing induction into the @entity54 military to fight in @entity59 – but as a consequence become the darling of the young , the black and the @entity63			1
@entity31 found himself unwittingly the standard bearer for the white establishment			2
@entity29 fanned the flames by labelling the simpler man who would become his arch - rival an ‘ @entity71 , ’ the most wounding insult for an @entity70 there was a foretaste of the current scramble for @entity0 - @entity76 tickets			1
@entity77 was one of the very few celebrities give a complimentary seat and other famous names had to work their way into the 20,000 crowd at the @entity32			0
@entity84 persuaded @entity85 to give him a camera and send him as their ringside photographer			0
fast - talking @entity29 offensively labelled @entity31 an ' @entity71 ' due to the support he got from white conservatives referee @entity92 , widely believed to have acted leniently in @entity29 's favour , orders the pair to their corners @entity99 v @entity97 july 4 , 1910 , @entity100 , @entity101 @entity103 v @entity102 june 22 , 1938 , @entity104 , @entity33 author @entity105 reported on the fight			1

this was one fight in which the action fully lived up to the hype and its place in history			0
@entity29 came out fast to dominate the first three rounds			2
@entity31 , encouraged by catching @entity29 with the last punch of the third , launched an attack to the body in the fourth which brought him into the ascendancy			1
@entity29 ’s speed of hand , dancing feet and combination punching kept him in a fight in which he was taking increasing punishment – along with a little help from referee @entity134 who declined to call a knock down when @entity31 sent him crashing in the eighth			1
@entity29 is laid out on the canvas as @entity31 is send to the corner before a long 10 - count in the 15th round somehow , heroically , survived the especially torrid 11th and 14th rounds			1
still some good judges had it close going into the 15th and last round			0
there all argument was ended			0
@entity31 caught him with the most wicked of all those trademark left hooks and this time there was no denying a count which appeared to edge a fraction longer than the stipulated ten seconds			2
@entity29 rose to his feet			2
again his courage carried him to the bell			0
the decision was unanimously in favour of @entity31 , although both men went to hospital			0
