by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:24 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 18 april 2013 campaign : @entity3 has launched a legal battle for the right to ask a doctor to end his life a paralysed man is fighting for the right to die with the help of a doctor , taking up the case begun by @entity13			1
@entity3 , 58 , only has slight movement in his right hand after a car accident in 1990			1
next month , he will tell the @entity17 that a doctor who acted to kill him would be carrying out a necessary procedure to end his suffering			1
mr @entity13 died last year at the age of 58 just days after he lost his legal bid to end his life with a doctor 's help , but his family won permission to continue his campaign			1
mr @entity3 said his life is so pointless that he often goes to bed at 5pm			1
but he is not physically able to kill himself and any doctor who helped him would be guilty of murder			2
mr @entity3 , from @entity31 , told the @entity32 : ' i just badly would like to see this law changed and then have that choice to just say , as and when i choose , call it a day			1
' he was severely injured in a car accident in 1990 , which he does not remember , and has no function in any of his limbs apart from a little movement in his right hand			1
in a statement to the courts , the father - of two said : ' i am in pain every single hour of every single day			2
i have lived with these conditions for a lot of years and have given it my best shot ' now i feel worn out and i am genuinely fed up with my life			2
i feel i can not and do not want to keep living			2
i feel trapped by the situation and have no way out			0
' i spend my day sitting in my wheelchair			0
my daily routine is tedious , monotonous and pointless			0
i often go to bed at 5pm - such is the pointlessness of it all			0
' i am fed up of going through the motions of life rather than living it			2
i feel enough is enough			0
' case : mr @entity3 is continuing the campaign started by @entity13 , pictured shortly before his death when he was told his @entity67 appeal had failed on august 16 he is seeking a formal statement that any doctor who helped him to end his life would be doing so out of ' necessity ' and would therefore be immune from prosecution			1
mr @entity13 's widow @entity73 , who has continued the right - to - die campaign following her husband 's death in august , expressed her gratitude to mr @entity3 for bringing his case to public attention			1
' he is in constant pain , ' she told @entity81			0
' he 's had this for 23 years and nothing they do will alleviate the pain and he 's had enough			0
he 's just tired of living like this			0
' mrs @entity87 said there was a ' huge amount of support ' for a move to change the law , adding : ' in my mind , the severely disabled are being blatantly discriminated against			1
why should n't they have the same rights as everyone else ? ' there would obviously be huge safeguards put in place so that people are protected			0
i know for a fact that there are many , many severely disabled people or people that have degenerative illnesses that know that one day , they will be severely disabled , that want a change in the law			2
' support : mr @entity13 's widow @entity73 , pictured with her daughters @entity114 and @entity115 , is sympathetic to mr @entity3 mr @entity13 was a keen sportsman until he was paralysed by a stroke while on a business trip to @entity118 in 2005			1
he was left crestfallen by a @entity67 decision ruling against his wish to end his life last year , and died a few days later after he began refusing food			1
mrs @entity87 later vowed to continue the legal battle because it was ' part of @entity13 's legacy '			1
mr @entity3 said if he won a change in the ' cruel ' law to secure protection from prosecution for a doctor who helped him take his life , he would die a ' very proud man '			1
in an interview broadcast on @entity132 's today programme he said : ' the quality of life is not there and i just think i have done everything i can , i 've tried everything			2
' he said he was in ' horrendous ' pain , adding : ' my will has gone			0
i think i 'm worn down , worn out			0
i 'm not getting any younger and i just badly want to see this law changed			0
' mr @entity3 said he wanted to be able to die ' with all my loved ones around me that i care about , in my bed , to have the ability to feel comfortable '			1
disability charity scope today strongly opposed any changes to the law and said mr @entity3 's views are not shared by many disabled people			2
@entity146 's chief executive , @entity151 , said : ' it is important that the views of @entity3 , who has taken up the legal challenge begun by the late @entity13 , are set in context			1
' although many people will sympathise with these cases , we must remember that the current law on assisted suicide protects the lives of disabled people in @entity163			0
' many disabled people tell us that without this legal protection , they would live under the assumption that they are a burden on society more widely and their loved ones			0
' we must avoid any temptation to change assisted suicide laws based on a couple of undeniably heart - wrenching and tragic cases			0
many disabled people are against any weakening of the law , and their voices need to be heard in this debate			0
' @entity180 , a disabled former victim of locked - in syndrome who runs the @entity184 group , said : ‘ just when we thought we might have a place in society , along comes another “ my life is n’t worth living ” campaign			2
‘ i ’m insulted , alienated and tired of the sense of being on a list of people who qualify for assisted death			0
