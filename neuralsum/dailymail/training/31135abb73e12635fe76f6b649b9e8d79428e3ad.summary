by @entity0 published : 13:06 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 13:06 est , 30 october 2013 it 's hardly as picturesque as the leaning tower of @entity3			1
but when this 50 - metre high pylon crashed to the earth after being strapped with explosives it was certainly an eye - catching moment			1
the giant structure took just seconds to smash into the ground after it was obliterated with explosives in the @entity13 estuary , @entity14			1
the pylon , which had begun to dangerously lean , was put under investigation and an exclusion zone erected boom ! plumes of dust and debris are scattered through the air as the explosives are detonated - making this a very noisy moment in the normally peaceful countryside as the foundations slowly tear away from the ground , a cloud of smoke and dust can be seen rising as the metal structures buckle under the sheer weight of the tower , the strong frames crumple and the wire cables snap			1
the pylon plummeted to earth in the rural countryside in a matter of seconds the tower began to lean when one of its foundations eroded			1
a 100 - metre exclusion zone was put around the tower earlier this month , amid fears that overhead electricity cables could fall			1
photographer @entity46 was one of the few witnesses of the demolition on sunday morning			2
mr @entity46 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , which is close to where the demolition took place , said the problems were caused by the pylon being rooted in an unstable sand foundation			0
' i 'd never seen a pylon like that before			0
it stands in an estuary and when the tide comes its feet are in the water , ' said the 67 - year - old			2
photographer @entity46 was one of the few witnesses of the demolition and managed to snap a sequence of shots showing the pylon 's collapse the pylon and its foundations can been seen snapped in two , with only some strained cables connecting the destroyed 50m tower a spokeswoman for @entity76 said the pylon will be dismantled and another erected for the short term while a permanent solution is considered ' i think the problem was that its feet were in the sand so it had very poor foundations			1
' despite the dramatic images , @entity46 described how the huge metal design made hardly any noise as it hit the deck			0
the retired council worker said : ' afterwards i went and told my neighbours who live close by and they had n't even heard anything			0
' the images capture the initial impact of the explosives clearly and @entity46 's fast shutter speed allows us to see the pylon tumbling down			0
' it was tricky because i was zoomed into the base initially to capture the first blast			0
' i quickly zoomed out mid-detonation so you could see the whole structure as it went into the ground			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity76 said the pylon will be dismantled and another erected for the short term			0
@entity76 will look at a long - term solution for the area , she said .			2
