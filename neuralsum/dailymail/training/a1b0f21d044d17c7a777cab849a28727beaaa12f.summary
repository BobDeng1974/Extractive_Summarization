a forgotten grand altar tapestry made by injured soldiers during the @entity2 will return to @entity3 after more than 70 years			2
the poignant piece depicting the @entity5 was painstakingly crafted by 133 casualties who had returned from the trenches , blinded , crippled and shell - shocked , they were lying in hospitals around @entity10 and were encouraged into embroidery by medics who hoped it would distract them and help them recover			1
a stitch in time : when thousands of injured soldiers were sent home from the trenches of the @entity2 , many were so shell - shocked they could barely hold their cigarettes - but 133 contributed to this lost tapestry symbolic : the tapestry 's five panels include the @entity5 , representing suffering , flanked by two palm leaves religious : the tapestry , pictured left in use at the old high altar at @entity3 before the @entity28 when it was bombed , was stitched by 133 soldiers			1
one unidentified man is pictured at work on the piece they created five individual panels , which were stitched together by the @entity35 a year after the war ended			1
the finished work , a 3m - wide tapestry of the golden grail representing suffering and two palm leaves signifying victory , was presented to @entity3 's and rested on the altar for several years			1
but after the cathedral was bombed in the @entity28 , the magnificent piece was put in a chest for safekeeping and remained there for more than seven decades			1
it has now been restored and will be put on display in august to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity2			2
it will remain on show for four years , the duration of the conflict			0
the name of every shell - shocked soldier who worked on the altar piece was recorded in a gold - leafed book and @entity3 's is hoping to track down surviving relatives			1
painstaking : the tapestry gained dust in a chest for more than seven decades and has now been restored then and now : @entity3 's today and after it was hit in an air raid during the @entity65 in april 1941 one of them was @entity67 , who was blinded in @entity68 in 1917 but became a ' finished artiste ' in embroidery at @entity71 for the @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74			2
the reverend canon @entity75 , precentor of @entity3 , said : ' the hands that clung to life in the trenches of the @entity2 and which lifted the bodies of dead comrades into graves came home to craft this beautiful altar frontal			0
' it is a symbol of faith despite everything and a deeply moving tribute to those who did not return			0
' it is our privilege at @entity3 's to let it stand as a memorial to the sacrifice , courage and legacy of a world at war and we are very keen to identify some of these men and learn of their stories			0
' it is not known whether the work was originally commissioned by @entity3 's , but the altar frontal was dedicated to the cathedral at a special service after the war had ended			2
the @entity109 was the main driver behind the project			0
the list of names , regiments and ranks , meanwhile , is being digitised so they and colourful illuminations which accompany them can be seen and searched via the cathedral website			0
