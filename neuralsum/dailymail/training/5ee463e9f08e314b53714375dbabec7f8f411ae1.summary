by @entity1 reporter published : 19:06 est , 4 november 2013 @entity3 : 08:42 est , 5 november 2013 one of @entity5 's most critically important and breathtakingly beautiful natural wonders may actually have @entity7 origins			1
@entity8 of the @entity9 proposes that the mighty @entity10 once fed into a ' super river ' that was the ancient equivalent of a mega @entity12 that drained much of @entity5			1
and with his proposal dawns the realization that @entity5 may actually have @entity7 to thank in a way for its most treasured splendor , the @entity17			2
@entity18 : a new theory by geologist @entity8 proposes that the @entity20 once flowed into a super river called the @entity22 that drained much of @entity5 and ended in a massive delta in @entity7 's @entity24 according to @entity25 , the @entity20 , which now provides water to 80 million americans in the @entity28 once flowed northeast into the now defunct @entity22			1
in fact , the proposal appears to have been fueled , at least in part , by the discovery of microfossils in @entity7 's @entity24 that likely come form the @entity28			1
the scenario , which appears in the november issue of @entity36 , posits that the river actually flowed southwest , as it does now , first , but was turned northward thanks to lifting continental plates			2
eh ! @entity25 ' proposal would mean that two of @entity5 's most splendid natural wonders -- the @entity20 and its surrounding @entity17 -- have @entity7 roots shifting plates , faulting , and volcanic activity are actually at the root what 's been pushing the @entity10 around for millions of years			1
around 16 million years ago , the the paleo - river began to be segmented by faulting a volcanism			0
and until around 6 million years ago , the day 's budding @entity17 was actually a large lake thanks to faulting that dammed the river			0
after around 6 million years ago , the @entity10 was cut off in @entity53 by the volcanism of the @entity56 hot spot			0
river in flux : the super river persisted until around 6 million years ago , at which point it was destroyed by the encroaching continental ice sheet			0
the @entity10 was cut off at @entity53 by the the @entity56 hot spot after fracturing and volcanic activity shifted it to the @entity65 , where it drains today the lake persisted until the @entity10 was finally captured by the @entity65 , which it flows into to this day			0
the resulting ' short - cut to sea level , ' @entity8 writes , helped to increase erosion that created the @entity17 we know today			0
so where 's the @entity22 ? the super river that was once the continent 's largest was destroyed by encroaching ice sheets during the @entity76 .			2

new study proposes that the @entity20 once flowed northeast , *meeting* the ' @entity22 , ' which flowed through @entity7 and drained into the @entity24
