speaking about setting up the agency , founder @entity85 said : ' i have always believed in physical fitness as a way of de-stressing and as a way of getting some good , quality time to yourself			1
' i also enjoy seeing the results it brings			2
so , i decided to open the agency and it has gone from strength to strength in the short time it has been open			0

' our guys and girls are the opposite			0
