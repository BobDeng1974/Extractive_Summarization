@entity7 , 37 , ( left ) has now been captured while his prison mate @entity15 , 38 , ( right ) remains on the run the 37 year - old was captured by officers without incident			1
the two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported			2
the men apparently descended from a thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison into the alley below			2
the wall faces a parking garage and is above air conditioning or heating units			2
crowds of people gathered outside the building where the ropes still blew in the breeze , shaking their heads in disbelief that someone could have escaped from a lockup in the heart of downtown @entity3 , just a block or two from key federal court and office buildings			0
the escape went unnoticed for hours , with surveillance video from a nearby street showing the two hopping into a cab shortly before 3 a.m. tuesday			0
they were no longer wearing their orange jail - issued jumpsuits			0
when the facility did discover the two men were gone , around 7 a.m. , what was found revealed a meticulously planned escape , including clothing and sheets shaped to resemble a body under blankets on beds , bars inside a mattress and even fake bars in the cells			0
a massive manhunt involving state , federal and local law enforcement agencies was launched , as @entity73 teams stormed into the home of a relative of @entity15 , only to learn the two had been there but had left , and searched other area homes and businesses -- including a strip club where @entity15 once worked			1
the owners of several small shops across the street from the wall said they did n't see any police activity until around 8:30 a.m. , when a dozen or more police cars and @entity73 teams rushed into the area			0
some police officers sprinted for a nearby subway entrance			0

the @entity19 where the two robbers escaped from using their makeshift bedsheet rope police and @entity103 conducted a state , federal and local search before eventually tracking down banks banks and @entity15 prepared meticulously for their escape and used hundreds of bedsheets to drop 20 stories to to the streets below on camera : seen here in may of 2011 , @entity15 was charged with robbing @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 during trial , he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom			1
he acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor , at times arguing that @entity123 law did n't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law			0
@entity15 pleaded guilty last october to robbing a @entity127 last year of nearly $ 4,000			2
@entity15 , who worked at the time at a suburban strip club , wore a coat and tie when he robbed the bank and had a gun stuffed in his waistband .			1
