by @entity0 @entity2 's official twitter feed had a peculiarly childish riposte to @entity4 when he congratulated @entity5 for his sudden goal in the opening minutes of @entity8 's clash with @entity9 last night			1
seconds after the strike , which picked up on a bad pass by a @entity17 defender , @entity11 and @entity12 ace @entity10 tweeted : ' yesss @ luisnani great goal			2
' it prompted a terse reply from @entity2 which read simply : ' @ @entity21			0
' sour grapes ? @entity2 's curt response to @entity4 congratulating @entity5 on his goal goal : @entity5 celebrates after scoring the first goal during the group g preliminary round match between the @entity8 and @entity9 at the @entity29 in @entity30 last night the curt tweet inspired thousands of responses , with many telling the @entity17 they were unlikely to ever enjoy @entity34 success until they start calling the sport by its proper name			1
in the end , however , terminology notwithstanding , it looked as if @entity8 might overpower @entity9 and book their place in the last 16			0
at least it did until @entity43 's cross caught @entity45 's diving header put the teams even at 2 - 2 in the dying seconds			1
the @entity17 soccer team were just seconds away from a historic win against @entity43 's @entity9 in @entity50 on sunday night that would have booked their place in the last 16 of the @entity34 now the @entity17 may need at least a point thursday against @entity52 to advance to the knockout stage			2
they could advance with a loss , depending on the result of the @entity9 - @entity57 game that will be played simultaneously			0
@entity10 did n't dignify @entity2 's dig with a response .			0

tweet from @entity63 star came during @entity17 team 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity9
@entity10 congratulated @entity11 teammate @entity5
@entity8 may need a point in last game to *qualify* for @entity70
