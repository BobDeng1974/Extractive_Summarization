by @entity1 reporter published : 06:00 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 08:15 est , 15 august 2013 the huntsmen look on as a baying pack on hounds rip a fox to shreds			0
and then the horn is sounded : the fox is dead			0
this harrowing video has been released after four members of the @entity11 , based in @entity12 , pleaded guilty to hunting with hounds			1
@entity29 , head of investigations at the @entity31 , and one of the team that filmed the incident , said : ' while we are pleased with this result , and the admission of guilt from the hunt staff concerned , we doubt it will change their behaviour going forward , or that the hunt themselves will admit illegal hunting and change their ways			1
' the grisly video shows the terrified fox taking refuge under bales of hay for 25 minutes before hunt staff use terriers , sticks and hounds to force it into the open where the pack of dogs bring it down and tear it apart			1
hiding : the huntsmen initially sent terriers to flush out the fox who had been hiding from the pack of dogs in a pile of hay bales killed : the hunt master , right , blew his horn to announce the kill and congratulated the hounds a triumphant huntsman then sounds his hunting horn - the traditional call for a kill when hunting was legal			1
he then picks up the fox carcass and holds it over the hounds so that they can better attack and ' rag ' it			0
the shocking clip , filmed at @entity82 , near @entity83 , last december , was handed over to police			0
@entity86 @entity85 , of @entity87 , @entity12 , whipper - in @entity88 , of @entity89 , @entity90 , terrierman @entity91 , of @entity92 , @entity12 , and amateur terrierman @entity93 of @entity94 , @entity12 , all pleaded guilty to hunting a wild mammal with a dog , at @entity97			1
@entity85 was fined £ 200 , @entity88 was fined £ 100 and @entity91 was fined £ 100			1
all three had to pay a £ 20 surcharge and £ 85 in costs			2
@entity93 was granted a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay a £ 15 victim surcharge and £ 85 costs			1
encouraging : he then picks up the carcass of the fox by the tail and allows the hounds to tug at it or ' rag ' it after the kill , the ' terrierman ' picked up the carcass and took it away with the terrier continuing to bite at it after the case , mr @entity29 said : ' we know that many hunts are regularly out there breaking the law , and that 's precisely why we have a team of professional investigators in the field - to capture illegal activity and work with the relevant authorities to bring about prosecutions			2
' this case is one of several from our work during the last hunting season ( 2012/13 ) , but a new season is just beginning			2
we can only hope that successful cases like this will make hunts think twice about continuing to blatantly flout the law , and start adapting their practices to hunt false trails , leaving animals well alone			2
' this was the will of the @entity140 public when the @entity141 was passed , but sadly it did n't save this fox			0
the successful outcome of this case today is a clear example of how the @entity141 can , and does , work when enforced			0
' the hunt retreats taking the evidence of the mauled fox away with them @entity151 , director of campaigns for the @entity153 , said : ' the @entity11 has accepted that the fox should have been shot in accordance with the exemption rather than killed by hounds			2
' whilst the @entity141 remains a ridiculous and illogical law , pleading guilty to minimise the time and money wasted on this case , was the sensible thing to do			0
' the @entity141 bans the hunting of wild mammals , notably foxes , deer and hares , with dogs in @entity169 and @entity170			1
in addition , a person commits an offence if he knowingly permits land which belongs to him to be entered or used in the course of hunting wild mammals			1
a person also commits an offence if he knowingly permits a dog which belongs to him to be used for hunting			1
anyone found guilty under the @entity141 is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale			0
the pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in @entity187 two years in the @entity188			0
however , hunting foxes with hounds remains legal in @entity191 .			0

@entity85 , @entity88 , @entity91 and @entity93 all pleaded guilty to hunting a wild mammal with a dog , at @entity97
they were fined up to £ 200 each for their roles in the banned hunt
investigators say their being caught is unlikely to change their behaviour
@entity206 hunting has been banned in @entity169 and @entity170 since 2005
