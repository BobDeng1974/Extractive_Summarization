@entity0 is thinking globally rather than nationally after beating @entity1 in @entity2			1

@entity11 is trying to make a long - awaited fight happen with @entity16 should @entity0 not be able to make the @entity11 bout happen , he wants to take on @entity16 he controlled the fight from the start , using his superior speed to stay ahead of @entity1 and out - punching his @entity12 opponent who could do nothing to change the rhythm as the night went on			1
@entity0 's performance was reflected in a comfortable win , with the fight scored 119 - 109 , 118 - 110 , 120 - 108 - the 30th win of his professional career			1
the match - up had been billed as a 50/50 contest , but @entity0 had other ideas as he controlled the flow of the fight and knocked @entity1 off his game			1
@entity27 has said @entity0 should be taking him on in an all - @entity95 grudge match @entity0 says @entity27 will always be there but there is a limited time frame on @entity11 and @entity16 wearing his specially - designed shorts encrusted with 24 - carat gold , @entity0 ruled the ring as he was able to have the final word in almost every round			1
@entity1 could not make his jabs count , with @entity0 's carefully - timed flurries making much the bigger impact			1
@entity0 was quick and hard with his punches , and @entity1 was put on the defensive with his frustration - and that of his corner - clear as the rounds went by			2
it was not until the eighth that @entity1 landed anything to bring him encouragement , but @entity0 immediately responded with a big counter-punch			0
@entity0 with @entity61 president @entity117 after victory early on sunday @entity1 , desperate for any momentum , attacked in the 10th but @entity0 responded with a series of huge blows and @entity1 looked resigned to defeat well before the end			2
' we worked very hard for this fight , ' @entity0 said			0
' i knew i had to make a statement at the 147lbs division against a tough guy in @entity129			0
