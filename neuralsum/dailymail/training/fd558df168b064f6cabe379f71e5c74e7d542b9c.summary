by @entity0 a band of four impossibly cute @entity3 brothers have moved into @entity5 's @entity4 and the highly social primates , which are easily recognised by their long white ' punk like ' sagittal crests extending from their foreheads to their shoulders , are said to be ' very cheeky '			1
the small @entity12 monkeys have settled into their new home from @entity14 , on the south coast of @entity16 , and are sure to be a star attraction in the state 's capital			0
keeper @entity20 said the four brothers all have different personalities and research has indeed shown that cotton - tops display both altruistic and spiteful behaviours			0
the species , which is found in tropical forests in north - west @entity28 , eat insects and plants in the wild and play an important role as seed dispersers in the tropical ecosystem			1
in their new abode , the brothers will also get to feast on bugs , fruit and flowers			0
the little monkeys are a critically endangered species , having been threatened by both the illegal pet trade and deforestation in @entity28 , where it is thought only about 6000 remain			0
flower - loving : the @entity3 , a small @entity12 monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg , is making itself at home at @entity5 's @entity4 punks : the primates are easily recognised by their long white sagittal crests extending from their foreheads to their shoulders tasting : the monkeys try out the local cuisine their new home has to offer - two bright coloured flowers , that they would also find in the rainforest monkeying around : one cotton - top appears to look into the camera with his brown eyes he 's my brother : it is hard to tell the four monkeys apart with their matching brown , white and black colours unique : keeper @entity20 said the four brothers do all have different personalities			1
this cheeky one appears to be sticking his tongue out no hands : when standing , it is clear to see how small the little monkeys actually are what 's this ? a @entity3 inspects his dinner before tucking in to the red petal tasty : the primate sticks out his tiny pink tongue as he munches on a plant do n't talk to me : the cute monkeys appear displeased with each other as they sit on a tree branch munching on their food settling in : keeper @entity20 feeds the cotton - tops at their new home at @entity4			2
