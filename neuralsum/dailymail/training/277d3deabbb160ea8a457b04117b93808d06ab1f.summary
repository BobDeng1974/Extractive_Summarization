by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 29 october 2013 it has long been hailed as the cheat 's way to exercise - while having fun			0
and now @entity6 researchers claim to have discovered exactly how many calories the average person burns during sex			1
they say that in young people , sex burns an average of 4.2 calories a minute for men and 3.1 calories a minute for women			1
sexercise ? the average man burns 4.2 calories a minute having sex , while women burn 3.1 calories			1
this makes it better exercise than a walk - but not as good as jogging , say @entity6 researchers with the average session lasting 24.7 minutes , this equates to 104 calories for men and 69 for women			1
this makes it better exercise than a walk - but not as good as jogging			1
the researchers , from the @entity33 at @entity34 , looked at 21 heterosexual couples aged between 18 to 35			0
the average recorded session lasted for 24.7 minutes - the shortest being 10 and the longest 57 minutes during four sex sessions at home , couples wore a @entity42 armband that tracked their energy expenditure			1
they also answered questions on how tired they were afterwards , how much effort they put in and how much they enjoyed it			0
participants had previously undergone a half hour treadmill test so the researches could measure how many calories they burned during exertion - and then compared the readings from the armband worn during sex			0
men , for example , burned 9.2 calories per minute on the treadmill - but only 4.2 in the @entity62 women , this fell to 7.1 calories while jogging			2
and , to help settle another holy grail question , the average recorded session lasted for 24.7 minutes - the shortest being 10 and the longest 57 minutes			2
while the figures are n't quite the marathon calorie burn some might hope for , they are better than those suggested in previous research			0
@entity73 , a biostatistician at the @entity74 at @entity75 , found that the average person burns a mere 21 calories during the average session			2
he discovered that sex lasted six minutes on average - ' disappointing , is n't it ? ' - and that the energy output equated to a paltry 20 or so calories - about the same as walking			0
however , if done with enough gusto , sex can still count as ' significant exercise ' , the @entity85 researchers said , reporting in the journal @entity90 .			0

men burn 4.2 calories a minute and women 3.1 , say @entity6 researchers
with the average session lasting 24.7 minutes , this equates to 104 calories for men and 69 for women
this makes it better exercise than a walk - but not as good as jogging
