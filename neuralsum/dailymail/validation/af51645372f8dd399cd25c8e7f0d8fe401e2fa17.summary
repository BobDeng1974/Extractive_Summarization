a mother - of - three says she was shocked to open a bag of her favourite crisps and discovered the world 's smallest @entity3 inside			1
@entity5 , 29 , from @entity6 , found several mini-wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks			1
the crisps were dwarved by the regular versions , which measure around 3.5cm , much to the amusement of her family			1
' it 's so funny			2
my family eats quite a lot of them and i like them because they 're not oily like other crisps			2
' i think these ones could possibly be the smallest in the world			0
what are the chances of finding so many at once ? it 's very unusual			0
' they certainly would n't fill you up but i suppose they 're good if you 're on a diet			0
' the crisps were dwarved by the regular versions , which measure around 3.5cm , much to the amusement of ms @entity5 and her family ms @entity5 said she has not contacted manufacturers @entity42 over the minature crisps , but said she would do if she found more			1
' i do n't feel ripped off , ' she said			0
' at the end of the day they 're @entity3			1
i have n't spoken to @entity42 about it and i did n't take them back to the shop			0
' i do n't feel hard done by , it 's quite funny really , my kids think they 're hilarious			2
' but if it happened again , i would probably have a word with @entity42			0
ms @entity5 found several mini-wotsits measuring just 1cm long in her 99p multi-pack of the cheesy snacks which she bought at a discount retailer in @entity6 ' i 'd already seen a post on @entity58 where somebody was saying they had small @entity3 so i 'm not the only one			1
' ms @entity5 says she and her family have decided against eating the crisps , but do not know what they are going to do with them			1
' at first the kids were really excited and wanted to eat them but when we found more they said they wanted to keep them , ' she said			0
' i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do with the @entity3 now			2
the kids will probably go in the cupboard and eat them when my back is turned			0

@entity5 , 29 , found a number of the crisps measuring just 1cm long
regular versions of the snacks are three times as *big* as the mini crisps
ms @entity5 's children think the tiny @entity3 are ' hilarious '
