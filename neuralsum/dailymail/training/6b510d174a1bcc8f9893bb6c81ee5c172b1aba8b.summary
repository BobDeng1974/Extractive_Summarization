by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 08:42 est , 20 april 2012 church officials have leapt to the defence of a bishop who provoked outrage by comparing president @entity6 ’s health care policies to the oppressive actions of ruthless dictators @entity9 and @entity10			1
bishop @entity11 told his congregation that @entity6 is following previous governments that ‘ tried to force @entity14 to huddle and hide only within the confines of their churches ’			1
‘ @entity9 and @entity10 , at their better moments , would just barely tolerate some churches remaining open , but would not tolerate any competition with the state in education , social services and health care , ’ he said , according to the @entity18 and @entity19			1
outrage : bishop @entity11 's , left , comparison of the actions of president @entity6 , right , to those of ruthless dictators @entity9 and @entity10 has sparked demands for an apology ‘ in clear violation of our first amendment rights , @entity6 - with his radical , pro-abortion and extreme secularist agenda - now seems intent on following a similar path , ’ he added , referring to the amendment in the @entity34 that protects religious freedom and other rights			1
his sermon during a sunday homily at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , was met with fierce criticism and demands for an apology			0
but @entity52 chancellor @entity51 rejected the outrage , explaining that @entity11 ‘ offered historical context and comparisons as a means to prevent a repetition of historical attacks upon the @entity58 and other religions			1
’ she added : ‘ we have currently not reached the same level of persecution			0
‘ but bishop @entity11 would say that history teaches us to be cautious			2
... ( @entity65 ) is concerned that our government is truly treading on one of our most dear freedoms , which is religious freedom			0
’ @entity11 's comments came a few days after the nation 's @entity71 called for a national campaign in defense of religious liberty and urged resistance to laws church officials considered unjust			2
the bishops said @entity58 must work to change recent state and federal laws church leaders believe violate religious freedom			0
the highest - profile clash has been over the mandate in the @entity6 administration 's health care overhaul that most employers cover birth control costs for workers			1
the @entity90 has offered a compromise for church - affiliated groups such as hospitals and universities , but bishops have said the changes do n't go far enough			0
history : bishop @entity11 was offering ' historical context and comparisons ' aimed at preventing attack on the church when drawing links to @entity9 , left , and @entity10 , right , according to church officials calls to the diocese from @entity107 rang unanswered thursday afternoon , and @entity108 did not immediately respond to an email request for further comment			1
@entity111 , meanwhile , filed a formal complaint asking the @entity113 to investigate the diocese , suggesting @entity11 may have crossed a line that put the church 's tax - exempt status in jeopardy			2
the group noted that in addition to the comments about @entity9 and @entity6 , @entity11 went on to tell those gathered sunday that , ‘ this fall , every practicing @entity58 must vote , and must vote their @entity58 consciences , or by the following fall our catholic schools , our @entity58 hospitals , our @entity124 , all our public ministries - only excepting our church buildings - could easily be shut down			1
’ ‘ no rational person could believe the bishop was doing anything but saying vote against @entity6 ’ in the november presidential election , said the group 's executive director , @entity129			0
federal law prohibits churches and other tax - exempt nonprofits from endorsing or opposing specific political candidates , but churches are allowed to engage in a wide range of political activities and the @entity113 rarely revokes a church 's tax - exempt status			0
the @entity144 also called on @entity11 to apologize for his comments			0
regional director @entity146 said thursday that the bishop needs a history lesson on ‘ religious intolerance and anti-semitism fostered in society ’ by @entity9 and @entity10 .			2
