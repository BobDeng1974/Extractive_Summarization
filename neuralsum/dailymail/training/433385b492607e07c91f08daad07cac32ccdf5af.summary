@entity0 had not played a competitive match since august , 2012 but returned to action at the @entity3			1
the @entity5 utility man has spent the past 26 months on the treatment table , in the gym , in the swimming pool , even in the stands scouting – anywhere but a football field			2
two cruciate - ligament injuries have been the cause of his absence but @entity0 ’s smile was wider than anyone else during the warm - up and his beam got even bigger after his challenge laid on the opening goal for @entity21 after just seven minutes			1
@entity0 ( left ) had n't played a competitive match for @entity5 since august , 2012 @entity21 ( left ) scores @entity5 's opening goal of the @entity25 clash @entity21 is congratulated by @entity27 boss @entity26 for his early goal against @entity29 @entity31 hoodoo it is fair to say that @entity29 have had the @entity34 sign over @entity5 of late			1
in the previous 17 meetings between the pair they had been unbeaten , winning 15 of those matches			0
you have to go back to a @entity41 goal in 2005 for the last time the @entity42 triumphed			0
the @entity27 had never won at the @entity3 and , while we ’ re at it , it was @entity29 who proved their conquerors at this stage last season , winning 2 - 0 after extra-time at @entity50			1
it just goes to show , history only counts for so much			0
no silva lining for @entity53 @entity54 might have been forgiven for wondering why he was even involved , for the @entity29 playmaker has n’t had much of a rest recently			2
having started the previous six matches – including last week ’s trek to @entity59 – @entity54 was a surprise inclusion given the proximity of the @entity63 derby			0
and @entity53 paid the price with the @entity65 lasting just seven minutes before succumbing to @entity0 ’s early challenge			2
@entity54 has missed just one game all season – the third - round tie at home to @entity71 – so to see him included against an under - strength @entity5 appeared somewhat needless			1
@entity54 was forced off with an injury in the first half following a challenge from @entity0 @entity76 was not present to check on @entity29 ahead of sunday ’s @entity63 derby			1
instead , the @entity79 boss sent trusted lieutenant @entity80 to run the rule over their neighbours			0
perhaps the @entity85 boss has done his scouting over the television , for last night ’s transmission was the 12th time from 15 matches that they have been broadcast live this season			0
@entity93 would no doubt have enjoyed the sight of @entity29 struggling to handle a strikeforce which cost a combined £ 3m – wait until @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are unleashed this weekend … @entity76 was not in attendance at the @entity3 ahead of the @entity63 derby			0

@entity5 *defeat* @entity29 in @entity25 *fourth* round
@entity0 returns to action after two years on the *sidelines*
goals from @entity21 and @entity109 hands @entity27 win
