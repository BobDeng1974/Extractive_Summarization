by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is happy to have a rare early start to his @entity5 campaign			1
the 2012 champion plays his first - round match against @entity10 @entity9 second on @entity12 court on monday			1
more often than not @entity2 has had to wait until tuesday or wednesday , and 12 months ago he did not begin the defence of his title until the third night session			1
@entity2 said : ' i have been here long enough to be used to the conditions and stuff now			1
focused : @entity2 is hoping to progress from the first round of the @entity5 on monday competitor : @entity2 will take on @entity10 @entity9 at the @entity12 court on monday ' i think for some guys that are coming in late , playing on the wednesday may help , but i have had enough time on the courts now to practice and prepare			1
so to get under way on monday is good			2
' the 27 - year - old has struggled all through 2014 to regain peak form and fitness following back surgery almost a year ago and is seeded only eighth at the year 's final grand slam			1
form remains a concern to his fans if not seemingly to the man himself , but fitness-wise @entity2 could scarcely be happier			2
the back pain that lingered through the first part of the season is in the past and the @entity41 had time after @entity42 to put some serious work in at a training camp in @entity45			0
fully fit : @entity2 is happy with how his preparations at a training camp in @entity45 have gone there have been encouraging signs over the last couple of weeks , with @entity2 reaching quarter - finals in both @entity52 and @entity53			1
but he would have wanted to go further in both and had chances to do so , failing to capitalise on leads against @entity57 and @entity58			0
that surely betrayed the lack of big match wins @entity2 has under his belt in 2014 - he has not beaten a top - 10 player or reached a final since @entity42 last year			1
he said : ' i have been playing well the last few weeks			0
i lost to guys who won the events , and had quite big opportunities in both those matches			0
i feel like i 'm playing well			0
this week has been very good preparation			0
' @entity2 is not the only @entity72 player in action on monday , with @entity74 , a direct entrant into the main draw in @entity77 for the first time , meeting @entity80 's @entity79			1
fellow @entity81 : women 's tennis player @entity74 is also in action at the @entity5 on monday and @entity85 's @entity84 makes his grand slam debut against @entity88 @entity87 after brilliantly fighting his way through qualifying			1
the 27 - year - old has spent all of his career until now trying to scrape a living at the lowest level of professional tennis			2
he rewarded himself by moving out of his budget apartment and into a boutique hotel in @entity99 , and his parents , sister and many friends are flying over to support him			0
' that 's a true dream , ' he said			0
' i 'd visualised it in my own head years ago , seeing my parents watch me at the @entity5			2
to have it manifest into reality is just an amazing thing			0
' i 'm going to give it absolutely everything i have and hopefully i can get the win			0
' @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 also play their first matches on monday .			2

@entity2 faces the @entity10 on monday at the @entity12 court
the @entity124 feels preparations for the @entity5 have gone well
@entity2 is seeded only eighth going into the final grand slam of the year
