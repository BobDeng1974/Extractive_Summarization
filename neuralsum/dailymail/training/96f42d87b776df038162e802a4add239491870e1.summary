now , the couple are allowed to drive around the lanes of their village @entity11 by local police in their timber tractor , though it can not get a vehicle licence			1
the rest of the car , including the frame , gears and axles , are timber , while the petrol tank was made out of a beer barrel			2
' i love to work with wood			2
and i like to create unique things which attract interest from people , ' mr @entity6 told @entity44			1
' my aim was to make it out of wood as much as possible			2
a wooden car must be made from wood			1
