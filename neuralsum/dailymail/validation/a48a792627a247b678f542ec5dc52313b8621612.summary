millionaire @entity1 was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in @entity4 , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in @entity7 , attorneys said in court papers friday			1
in the papers filed at the @entity10 in @entity7 , @entity11 and @entity12 asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep @entity1 jailed			1
they say he should be released			0
' i think he 's an easy target and everybody 's piling on			0
... they 're gon na find nothing , " @entity12 , the lead attorney on @entity1 's team , told @entity24			1
' i think @entity25 and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie			1
the attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where @entity1 was arrested			1
they are seeking any and all records related to @entity1 and @entity54 , the pseudonym @entity1 used to check into the hotel			2
the documents blasted the arrest , which the attorneys say was orchestrated ' to coincide with the final episode of the @entity61 docudrama @entity62			2
the six - part documentary concluded sunday			0
@entity1 , a member of a wealthy @entity65 real estate family , was charged with murder in @entity4 for the december 2000 shooting death of @entity68			1
@entity1 's arrest came shortly before the @entity61 finale about his links to three killings â€” that of his first wife , who disappeared in @entity65 in 1982 ; @entity68 , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in @entity80 whose dismembered body was found floating in @entity82 in 2001			1
@entity83 : @entity1 is on suicide watch at a @entity25 detention center			1
he is expected to appear in court monday @entity1 has only ever been tried for the @entity80 killing , and he was acquitted of murder			1
@entity1 waived extradition in @entity7 but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance			1
court documents say investigators found nearly $ 43,000 in cash , a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested			0
authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room			0
however , @entity1 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge			1
in the case , prosecutors could seek to play portions from @entity112 that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live			2
he has been charged in @entity117 with first - degree murder in the 2000 killing @entity68 , the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in @entity65 in 1982			2
@entity1 , 71 , who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $ 4 billion , has long denied killing @entity68 and @entity128 , who was declared dead even though her body was never found			2
investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with @entity68 when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near @entity135			0
after the killing , @entity1 disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap @entity82 , @entity80 , boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001			0
he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in @entity82			2
while legal experts said @entity1 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing			1
' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said @entity159 , a former prosecutor and professor at @entity161			0
' the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face			0
' in the case of @entity167 , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with @entity172 because it contradicted other evidence			0
the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview			0
' it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said @entity181 , who won @entity167 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife			0
' there was an image projected that a lot of people had about @entity1 as a difficult person			0
in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person			0
' prosecutors are not commenting on the @entity68 case while @entity1 is still held in @entity25 , where he also faces firearms charges .			1

@entity1 's legal team say authorities made an ' invalid arrest ' march *14*
claim he was illegally arrested on murder , drug and weapon charges
lawyers say it was a publicity stunt to coincide with @entity112 finale
