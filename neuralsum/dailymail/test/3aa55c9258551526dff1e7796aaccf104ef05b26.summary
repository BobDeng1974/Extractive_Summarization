talks between the two super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill , but @entity2 ’s promoter , @entity10 , attempted to jolt @entity0 ’s camp into a july 18 fight in @entity13 by offering the biggest cheque of the @entity16 ’s career to date			1
the proposal was made live on television , with @entity0 ’s team , led by @entity21 ’s @entity20 , given until the end of the week to accept the terms			2
@entity10 presents the cheque for £ 1.5m to set - up @entity2 's fight with @entity0 @entity26 boss @entity10 said the cheque offered 1.5m reasons for the two boxers to fight @entity2 stares down the camera to tell @entity0 to ' put his money where his mouth is ' it ’s a bold move that could see @entity35 pocket substantially less @entity0 if the pay - per - view purchases do not meet @entity10 ’s predictions			1
but with the fight more than a year in the making a low revenues seems unlikely , although at present there is only a moderate chance @entity0 ’s camp will accept the terms , having released their own statement to demand further talks			2

’ @entity2 is the defending @entity64 super-bantamweight champion and wants to fight @entity0 in @entity13 @entity2 celebrates his win over @entity66 at the @entity67 in november last year @entity10 added : ‘ @entity2 might not get £ 1.5m			1
that is not how this offer is working			0
this offer is us working together to come up with an offer , that we believe @entity0 can not turn down			2
if it does n’t do the pay - per - view buys that we anticipate , @entity2 might get a third of that ( £ 500,000 to @entity0 ’s £ 1.5m )			1
@entity0 does not have to take any risk			0
