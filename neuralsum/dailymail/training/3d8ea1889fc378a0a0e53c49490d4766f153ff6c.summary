by @entity0 and @entity1 showbusiness correspondent earlier in the day , they had greeted huge crowds outside @entity5 as the country rejoiced at victory in the @entity8			1
and this is how – according to filmmakers , at least – the young princess @entity10 and princess @entity11 subsequently mingled with the masses as the raucous @entity15 celebrations continued into the night			1
girls ’ night out is a fictionalised version of the evening of may 8 , 1945 , when the future queen and her sister slipped out of the @entity5 and joined in with the party spirit			1
@entity10 detailed the occasion in her teenage diaries , recalling the event was ‘ great fun ’ as she mixed with revellers in the streets			0
@entity10 's friend and cousin , the @entity32 @entity31 , claimed many years later in her memoir the group slipped out of the palace to join the nation 's carousing			1
the new film will put what it will claim is flesh on the bones of that extraordinary assertion			0
however , that flesh is likely to prove highly controversial as it will suggest princess @entity11 danced exuberantly in a @entity45 fountain and the sisters then went on to a club in @entity48			1
@entity45 has been transformed for the filming of @entity15 production @entity50 ( pictured )			2
hundreds of actors took to the @entity53 landmark today to film scenes for the movie - which is a re-imagining of events on may 8 1945 revelers smile at the camera as they celebrate the end of the @entity8 in @entity60			1
it is thought more than one million people in the @entity63 celebrated on that night - many of whom flocked to @entity45 a fictional princess @entity10 , played by @entity66 actress @entity65 grins in glee as she watches over the events taking place at the @entity53 landmark in one fictional scene , princess margaret - dressed in fur and her best baby - pink gown - wades through knee - deep water in the @entity45 fountains ( pictured ) princess @entity11 , played by @entity76 , lifts up her skirt to make her way round the fountain in the re-imagined @entity15 celebrations			1
the script has not been verified by the @entity5 - although the book on which is it based is thought to have been approved by the @entity10 the fictional princess @entity11 dances in rather raucous celebration - a scene that is certainly not documented in mrs @entity31 ' extraordinary memoir the @entity88 by @entity31 was written with the full knowledge of the @entity10 - who is said to have read and approved sections of the text			1
however , there has been no official corroboration of its account of the @entity15 celebrations			0
the book recounts how , on the night of may 8 , the @entity10 enjoyed ‘ a unique burst of personal freedom ; a @entity102 moment in reverse ’			0
mrs @entity31 writes : ‘ i ca n’t remember exactly what we got up to , and so the @entity10 has provided me with an aide - memoire taken from her diary entries for that time			2
’ the memoir states young princess @entity11 's diary entry for the following day reads : ' @entity110 announced unconditional surrender			1
sixteen of us went out in crowd , cheered parents on balcony			0
up @entity116 [ @entity117 ] , @entity118 , great fun			0
' out in crowd again – @entity45 , @entity118 , @entity121 , walked simply miles			2
saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate , partied , bed 3am ! ’ it also says the future @entity10 wrote in her diary : ' out in crowd , @entity127 , @entity121 , @entity128 , @entity118 , @entity129 , @entity130 , ran through @entity132			0
walked miles , drank in @entity134 , saw parents twice , miles away , so many people			0
later she wrote : ' out in crowd again			0
rained , so fewer people			0
congered into house [ a reference to the conga and @entity5 ]			2
bed at 3am ! ’ actress @entity65 , who plays the young princess @entity10 in the film , can be seen enjoying the crowds in a fabulous pink embellished dress princess @entity10 smiles and laughs with a handsome man in uniform in the controversial film the actress looks lost in the crowd before leading a young man in full uniform through the party - goers @entity158 waves from the balcony of @entity5 on @entity15 as he stands with @entity10 ( centre left ) and their children @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) the cast of @entity163 celebrate the fall of @entity166 by climbing on to a lion statue in @entity45			1
the filming took place exactly 69 years after the original public holiday the party continues among the crew of the film , which has an all - star cast and has been filmed in numerous locations across the country later in the memoir , mrs @entity31 , writes : ' a gang of us , including the two princesses , were given permission by the @entity182 to slip away anonymously and join the rejoicing crowds on the streets			1
' there must have been about 16 of us and we had as escort the @entity187 , a very correct @entity189 captain in a pinstriped suit , bowler hat and umbrella			0
' princess @entity10 was in uniform , as a subaltern in the @entity195 – the @entity195			0
she pulled her peaked cap well down over her face to disguise her much - photographed image			0
miraculously she got away with it			0
' cast and crew surround the landmark 's fountain in a scene which appears to be between takes uniformed cast members vigorously wave a selection of @entity63 and @entity208 flags in one scene revelers wade in to the water at the central @entity53 landmark - hitching up their skirts and shorts			2
the film has already caused controversy as it depicts a young @entity10 kissing an @entity217 gunner the celebrations continue for the cast members - many of whom are wearing hats and waving small @entity223			2
the film is a re-imaging of events , based on a memoir a fun - loving cast member wrapped in a @entity230 flag with a party hat on her head smiles as she walks through the streets the new film , @entity234 , however , varies from this account somewhat			1
in some scenes , the young royals are seen chatting with handsome young men - before princess @entity11 jumps into the @entity45 fountain			1
@entity240 can be seen getting very close to a man in uniform - and is later shown kissing a dashing young @entity243 gunner			1
the film stars @entity245 as @entity158 , @entity246 as @entity10 as well as @entity65 as princess @entity10 and @entity76 as @entity11			1
according to the film an adventurous @entity11 , then just 15 , slips away from her guards and hops on a bus			2
princess @entity10 then races around the city in a bid to find her younger sister - finding the gunner , who has no idea who she is , along the way as she attempts to find @entity11 , she and her companion visit a couple of sleazy @entity261 nightclubs - and eventually the princess 's identity is revealed			1
two female characters seem to be having a whale of a time drinking beer and waving their flags while wandering through the crowds on set men from the armed forces wave flags and drink from bottles of beer while chatting to young women			0
despite what the controversial kissing scene in the film would suggest , princess @entity10 had already met @entity280 by 1945 a cast member with a trumpet is wheeled around by a colleague			2
the film has been part - produced by @entity285 four cast members , some wearing party hats , chat to one another while another plays a trumpet while sitting in a wheelbarrow			0
