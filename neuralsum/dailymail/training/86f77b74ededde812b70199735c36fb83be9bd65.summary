by @entity0 published : 05:27 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 27 may 2013 engineering student @entity3 models the new @entity6 energy - generating shoe mechanical engineering students have developed a shoe that can charge a mobile phone			1
four students were able to harness and store the energy produced with each step a person took and use it to charge a telephone			1
the new @entity6 shoes turn motion into phone charge and it is hoped that the same principle may one day be use for life - saving medical devices			1
four students at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , were approached by @entity25 , a company who specialises in equipment and services for the oil and gas industry			1
they wanted the students to develop new green energy technologies			2
the self - titled @entity33 , @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity35 - decided to focus their attention on what is technically known as a shoe - mounted generator			2
another device to draw energy from the motion of the knee had already been developed and patented which led them to analyse other sources of energy from the human body			2
working with the @entity49 at @entity50 in @entity23 , the team discovered that the force at the heel delivered far more potential for power than any other part of the foot			1
' we went to the lab and saw the force distribution across the bottom of your foot , to see where the most force is felt , ' @entity34 said			2
scroll down to watch video the students - from left , @entity35 , @entity66 , @entity3 and @entity34 - have developed a shoe that captures and stores the energy that is released from the foot 's heel when walking ‘ we found it would be at the heel and at the balls of your toes , as you push off			1
' we went with the heel because , unless you ’re sprinting , you ’re letting gravity do the work			0
' their devices as currently designed are too big for day - to - day wear , but the prototypes developed at @entity22 ’s @entity84 with the team ’s advisers , @entity87 and @entity88 , meet the benchmarks set by @entity25			1
days numbered ? : the new technology could provide a welcome alternative to plug - in chargers @entity87 is a professor of mechanical engineering and materials science ; @entity88 is a senior principle research engineer in corporate technology at @entity25			1
the prototypes deliver an average of 400 milliwatts , enough to charge a battery , in benchtop tests			0
however the device produces a little less in walking tests , where the moving parts do n’t move as far			0
the shoes send energy through wires to a belt - mounted battery pack			1
a voltage regulator keeps energy flowing steadily to the battery			0
the @entity6 technology hits the ground before any other part of the prototype shoe			1
a lever arm strikes first			0
it is attached to a gearbox that replaces much of the shoe ’s sole and turns the gears a little with each step			0
the gears drive a motor mounted on the outside of the shoe that generates electricity to send up to the battery			2
‘ it may be worth looking into having both the heel and the ball of the foot produce power , especially if this shoe could be used while running , ’ @entity66 said			1
a @entity131 teen has attracted the attention of tech giants @entity133 for her revolutionary invention which charges a phone in 20 seconds flat			2
the super-fast device has been dubbed a supercapacitor by 18 - year - old @entity138			2
so far , @entity138 has only used the supercapacitor to power a light - emitting diode or led - but she sees a bright future that one day will see her invention powering cellphones , cars and any gadget that requires a rechargeable battery			1
the charger is tiny and able to handle 10,000 recharge cycles - ten times more than normal batteries			2
how an 18 - year - old girl has managed to invent something that multi-national corporations have not has led to her being flooded with offers for her amazing leap forward			0
@entity133 have been in contact with @entity138 to explore how she plans to change the makeup of cell phone battery life			1
the students expect the project to be picked up by another team of @entity22 students in @entity163 , with the hope they can refine the materials , shrink the size and boost the power output , all of which will get @entity6 closer to being a commercial product			1
' if we could prove that we could produce some usable power , store it in a battery and discharge that battery on a mobile device or an mp3 player , then we could prove this device works , ' @entity66 said			1
' now the next team can come in and make it smaller and lighter without sacrificing power			0
' for now , the team would like to provide enough dependable power for cellphones and other portable electronics			0
but @entity25 has partnered with the @entity186 to apply its expertise in moving fluids to a new generation of artificial heart pumps , and @entity22 students hope their work will contribute to that goal			0
' just the fact that you ’re relying on human movement to power something that ’s critical to your life is a little bit scary , ' @entity66 said			1
' you sleep for eight hours a day and you ’re not moving			0
' you want to make sure you ’re making enough power during the day to last			0
realistically , this might be more of a device to charge your phone			0
' theoretically it would be something you just wear , and you do n’t notice it			0
that ’s the end goal			0
if you showed someone the shoe while you ’re standing still , they would n’t even see the device			0

@entity213 students have developed @entity6 shoes that use the foot 's movement to harness and store electricity for a mobile phone
it is hoped that the same technology will eventually be used to power life - saving medical equipment
