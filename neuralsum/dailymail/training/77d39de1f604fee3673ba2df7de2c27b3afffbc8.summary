by @entity0 follow @ @ esdonn the @entity1 had come and gone in the pool on saturday night without truly igniting the @entity4 crowd			2
that was about to change			0
with swimming gold having been won on each of the first two days , there was a sense of expectation as the men walked out for the final of the 100 metres breaststroke			1
this time , they would have to settle for less			0
haul : @entity13 adds 100m breaststroke bronze to his medal haul podium : @entity13 stands with gold medallist @entity17 of @entity18 and the winner of silver @entity21 from @entity22 this time , @entity13 would have to settle for bronze			1
in truth , after turning in fifth position , @entity13 did well to make up the ground on @entity18 @entity17 and @entity27 champion @entity21 from @entity22			1
in the end , despite the deafening roars , it was just not to be @entity17 set a @entity31 in finishing in 58.94 for gold , with van der @entity21 taking silver in a time of 59.28			2
@entity13 touched the wall in 59.47 , with team - mate @entity37 fourth in 1:00.44			1
while @entity13 ’s bronze could n’t quite replicate the gold from opening night , it was still aremarkable effort			1
yet , while some might have been stunned by the boy from @entity45 ’s emergence at these games , it was no surprise that he was involved at the business end of the 100m			0
in the 200m final on thursday , @entity13 ’s performance against fellow scot @entity50 , thefavourite , was dominant			1
he has been producing such efforts in the shorter distance over the last 12 months			0
that he went faster than his illustrious team - mate has ever gone in 200m was almost lost in the aftermath , as the @entity27 silver medallist ’s performance was put under the microscope			0
in action : @entity13 competing in the men 's 100m @entity60 @entity50 bowed out of the 100m at the semi-final stage on friday night , bringing an end to his games			1
to his credit , he maintained that he would remain a ‘ cheerleader ’ for the rest of the squad			0
last night , however , it was all about the lad who learned to swim in the unassuming environment of @entity72 of @entity74 pool in @entity75			0
his swimming career had been almost over before it began , with @entity13 making for a rather over-excitable child and thought unsuited to the discipline demanded by the sport			1
standing before the blocks , as he waited for the race to begin last night , it was n’t difficult to imagine him as a hyperactive four - year - old			0
@entity13 had qualified second fastest in qualifying , @entity18 ’s @entity17 looking dangerous with aleading time of 59.16			1
@entity85 , the world record holder , was always likely to contend , with the @entity87 in lane three			0
@entity13 ’s @entity1 team - mate @entity37 — an @entity27 semi-finalist in this event two years ago — was also determined to make an impression , having failed to qualify in either the 50m or 200m			1
disappointed : poster boy @entity50 had to settle for silver in the @entity93 it was a world - class field — and it would require an inspired performance to emerge victoriousfrom it			1
for @entity13 , he still has the 50m breaststroke to come , as well as an appearance in the 4x100m medley relay			2
you would n’t discount him adding to his tally			0
he was magnanimous afterwards , paying tribute to the @entity18 for being the first @entity104 to break the 59 - second barrier in the event			0
‘ that was an outstanding swim from @entity17 , ’ admitted @entity13			2
‘ i ’m delighted for him			0
’ elsewhere , there was to be home disappointment in the men ’s 50m backstroke semi-finals , as all three @entity1 fell short — with @entity113 ( 10th ) , @entity114 ( 11th ) and @entity115 ( 13th ) .			2
