the annual @entity9 fasting period has come to an end and these commuters were trying to get home as quickly as possible to prepare for the festival of @entity14 , which begins tomorrow			1
for the past month observant muslims across the world have refrained from eating or drinking anything from dawn to sunset in a show of spiritual devotion			0
in the morning , many will attend mass prayer gatherings called @entity61 - with those taking place outside @entity4 reputed to be the biggest anywhere in @entity65 - before visiting friends and family to enjoy private celebrations			2
they will greet each other with the traditional @entity9 greeting of @entity71 , which translates roughly as ' @entity14 blessings ' and is more or less equivalent to ' @entity73 '			1
as well as the special prayers and celebrations , customs of @entity14 include dressing up in new clothes , eating special delicacies , giving presents and , for women , decoration of the hands with henna			1
end of @entity7 rush : men cling on to carriages wherever they are able as the packed passenger train prepares to make its way out of @entity4 , taking hundreds back to their families in the surrounding areas can you move down please ? conditions on @entity95 's packed public transport make the @entity97 rush hour seem like a leisurely journey in luxury in the @entity101 carriages of the @entity102 last ditch bid : passengers help a woman jump from a bridge onto an overcrowded train to travel home for @entity14 a man prepares to catch the woman as she lets go , while another prepares to climb down from the bridge a @entity114 military spokesman says prisoners at the @entity116 will be served traditional holiday meals to mark the end of @entity7			1

the @entity114 says 55 prisoners still met the criteria to be classified as hunger strikers as of wednesday even though most have been eating at least once a day			0
the number dropped by half since the start of @entity7 in july			2
lawyers for prisoners say some likely gave up the strike because of @entity7 or were just worn out by the protest			2
@entity139 , a @entity141 - @entity1 muslim , told @entity142 that some of the special dishes being passed round @entity14 tables may include shemai , a sweet made with vermicelli and milk , and fita , fried dough balls made with rice flour and drizzled with ghee - which he described as ' delicious '			1
for those who can afford it in @entity1 , there would also be lots of different types of roasted meat on offer , served with that perennial favourite , pilau rice			0
many will be feeling a sense of relief at the end of @entity7 , a month of fasting during which observant @entity9 are encouraged not to eat or drink anything - even water - during the hours of daylight			1
a time of spiritual reflection and increased worship , during the period @entity9 are expected to pay more attention to the teachings of their religion , also refraining from sexual relations with their spouses as well as generally sinful behaviour			0
it is believed to help teach devotees how to better practice self - discipline and sacrifice , but also inculcate empathy for those less fortunate than themselves and encourage generosity and charity			0
risky business : ferry passengers take their lives in their hands by clinging on to the sides of the packed vessel departing the @entity195 ferry terminal on the outskirts of @entity4 earlier today festive : crowds gather at the terminal as they wait to board the ferries to take them down the @entity203 river comfy ? @entity1 sit on blankets laid out on the packed ferry as they rush home to be with their families charity is also an important part of @entity14			2
mr @entity139 explained : ' i have to give a minimum of £ 5 per person in my family - which is the equivalent of a bag of rice			0
' this time of year , because it 's the @entity220 , a lot of people also give their @entity221 , which is 2.5 per cent of your wealth , irrelevant of much you earn			0
' so my wife has to give 2.5 per cent of the value of all her jewellery , which she can either do by selling some of it ... or i can pay for it			0
' if you watch the @entity9 tv channels you would have seen there has been a massive amount of fundraising going on over the past month			2
