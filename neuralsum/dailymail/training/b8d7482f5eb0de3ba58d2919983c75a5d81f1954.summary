plans for a new religion - free oath due to be introduced next month have proved controversial , with 839 complaints to the movement ’s leadership and warnings of a damaging split			1
instead of a promise to @entity11 , youngsters will instead pledge to ‘ be true to myself and develop my beliefs ’ after it was decreed the old wording could discourage new members from joining			1
backed by a former bishop , the group from @entity28 , @entity29 had pledged to retain the old oath , saying the organisation had ‘ @entity11 at its core ’			1
however yesterday its stand was at an end after leaders of the troop met senior figures from @entity3 , which has insisted no exceptions can be made			2
the change of heart came after pressure from local volunteer and self - professed atheist @entity45 as well as from the @entity46			0
@entity47 , leader of the @entity28 - based @entity49 troop , had written to a local newspaper along with @entity52 representatives pledging to stick to the old @entity54 oath			1
‘ @entity3 has @entity11 at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation , ’ they wrote			1
their stand was last week backed by former bishop of rochester @entity64 who insisted @entity70 was ‘ rooted in the @entity54 faith ’ and warned the new oath could split the movement			2
it emerged yesterday that 839 complaints had been made by members to girlguiding @entity74 about its insistence that all troops should introduce the new oath			0
yesterday , however , it emerged that the @entity79 ’s group had agreed to fall into line and accept the new wording after meeting national leaders			1

’ inclusive : chief guide , @entity83 says the pledge is about including girls of all faiths and beliefs , not just @entity54 but mrs @entity47 added that she would n’t instruct members of the troop whether to follow the old or new oath , saying : ‘ it ’s for the girls to decide what they choose to do			1
‘ @entity3 is saying , “ yes they will make the new promise ” , but the way that the girls explore their own spiritual journey is up to them , it ’s not dictated by anybody else really			0

the climbdown was welcomed by @entity45 , 28 , an atheist volunteer leader who had accused the @entity28 group of excluding non-believers , saying ‘ all i wanted out of it was for the troops to take the secular promise ’			1
‘ i think it ’s more important that all girls get included in @entity127 than just the ones that have religious affiliation , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s a new oath , and more leaders that are younger and perhaps less stuck in their ways should make @entity3 more exciting for people that want to join that do n’t just want to go and sit in a church hall with women who are older than their mothers talking about whatever it is they ’re talking about			0
