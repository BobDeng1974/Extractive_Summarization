@entity13 , whose brother was was shot and blinded by gun maniac @entity3 in july 2010 and was found dead at his home 17 months later , wrote on @entity17 : ‘ give them more than a bloody piece of plastic and some spray			1
tragic ! ’ his call was backed by @entity23 , whose wife was gunned down when she attended a botched robbery at a travel agent in @entity27 , @entity28 , in 2005			1
yesterday 's double killing has prompted his twin brother @entity32 , pictured right with @entity3 in @entity33 , to call for police to carry firearms mr @entity6 said the killing of officers @entity38 , 32 , and pc @entity39 , 23 , in @entity40 , @entity41 , on tuesday should ' open the public 's eyes ' to the need for police to be armed			1
but chiefs have warned against the move , with one insisting it was the ' clear view of the @entity8 police service from top to bottom ' that officers would rather not be armed			1
and deputy prime minister @entity52 said there would be ' considerable risks ' to giving every police officer a gun			1
the @entity57 said there were no plans to routinely arm officers			1
@entity13 , a former policeman in @entity61 now serving in @entity33 , said it ‘ beggars belief ’ that @entity8 officers routinely face criminals unarmed			1
he added : ' how many officers need to die before the powers realise it is the 21st century ? ‘ no job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict			2
we do n’t go on jobs where people are happy to see us			0
gunned down : pc @entity76 ( left ) was shot dead in @entity27 , @entity28 , in 2005			0
her widower , @entity23 ( right ) , believes police should be routinely armed ‘ i am angry some other families have now lost a daughter , sister , mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner			1
‘ if the public knew how thin that blue line was , they would be ashamed			2
’ mr @entity6 , whose wife was a @entity28 police officer , said : ' you would n’t think it ’d happen again , but it has			2
' he told @entity92 : ' i think policing , as regarding going to scenes of crimes , should be monitored better , and i think police , in honesty , should be armed , walking into situations that they ’re not totally aware of			2
victims : the killing of pc @entity39 ( left ) and pc @entity39 ( right ) has prompted calls for police officers to be routinely armed ' you ca n’t have armed response at every situation , but i think , as an officer being armed , walk into a situation , feeling more comfortable , walking into that situation , thinking , " i could respond to that situation "			1
' @entity112 , a 38 - year - old mother - of - three , who also had two stepchildren , was shot and killed on her youngest daughter ’s fourth birthday as she responded to an alarm call			0
her colleague , pc @entity118 , was wounded			0
unlike many of their overseas counterparts , @entity8 beat constables are not routinely armed and instead rely on 6,500 specialist firearms officers			1
the president of the @entity124 , sir @entity125 , warned against a rush to routinely arm officers			1
' guns do n't necessarily solve the problem , ' he said			0
' you only have to look at the @entity132 experience			0
many colleagues in @entity132 are lost without even drawing their gun at close ranges			2
' sir @entity125 said it was the ' clear view of the @entity8 police service from top to bottom ' that officers prefer to be unarmed because the public dislike approaching constables bearing weapons			1
he said minimum use of force and intervention was the ' bedrock ' of @entity8 's policing model			0
he told @entity149 's today programme policing is ' a risk business ' , adding : ' as we speak , officers will be responding to calls not knowing what they will get to and not knowing exactly what they will be dealing with when they arrive			1
' it 's just a harsh fact of policing and , tragically on occasions , things go horribly wrong			0
' the chief constable of @entity41 force has also rejected calls for more guns on the streets			0
sir @entity167 said : ‘ we are passionate that the @entity8 style of policing is routinely unarmed policing			1
concerns : sir @entity125 , president of the @entity124 , warned against a rush to routinely arm officers ‘ sadly we know from the experience in @entity132 that having armed officers certainly does not mean , sadly , that police officers do not end up getting shot			1
’ mr @entity52 said : ' i do n't think this is the time to rush to instant judgments , this really is a time for mourning and support , of course , for the family and friends of the two women who have been killed			0
' we have a long tradition in this country , which is a great tradition , of policing in the community , of the police being part of the public and the public supporting and giving their consent to the police			2
' i think if we were , in an instant to , in a sense , arm our police to the teeth so they become separate from the public , that would be quite a big change which would have considerable risks attached to it			1
' i think it is the kind of thing that you need to look at very carefully and certainly not , even though i know emotions are running high , in an instant way after this terrible , terrible tragedy			0
' passionate : @entity41 police chief @entity167 does not want to arm officers mr @entity52 , speaking at a central @entity215 youth club , added : ' of course there are going to be lots of questions about the nature of armed violence and gang violence in @entity41 and elsewhere			1
' but he added : ' i really just think right now everybody is reeling with shock , that these two brave women have been gunned down in this extraordinarily cruel way			0
' @entity227 , of the @entity228 , said : ' we have firearms officers regularly patrolling the streets of the @entity8 already and colleagues up and down the country have very mixed views about carrying firearms			0
it is a very personal choice			0
' speaking on @entity238 , she described the killings of @entity240 and @entity241 as ' absolutely dreadful '			0
' it is difficult for our colleagues who have got to carry on with the job today , because our job goes on , we are professionals and we have a service to deliver , " she said			0
' yesterday was absolutely dreadful , for every police officer and part of our family across the @entity8			0
' it made me feel sick to the bottom of my stomach when i found out the news			0
it is the call that we dread			0
' we do work together , we pull together as a large family - from the communities as well as the police family - to look after each other			0
' @entity261 , who was a senior cabinet minister in @entity263 's government , said he would be ' reluctant to see ' routine arming of the police but called for the reintroduction of capital punishment to be considered			1
writing for the @entity268 , he put : ' effective policing demands that the relationship between the police officer and the public should be a comfortable one , reflecting that the constable is a member of the public and historically had few powers which were not also possessed by any other citizen			2
' the carrying of guns would widen the gap which has grown between the police and the public in recent years			2
' that does not mean that the whole question of the deterrent effect of capital punishment should not be re-examined			0
' a @entity57 spokesman said : ' as the chief constable of @entity289 , sir @entity167 , and sir @entity125 of @entity124 have clearly expressed , the @entity8 style of policing is based on policing by consent with police officers part of the communities they serve			1
