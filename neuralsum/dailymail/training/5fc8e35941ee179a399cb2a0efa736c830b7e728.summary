published : 07:38 est , 4 december 2013 @entity1 : 11:05 est , 4 december 2013 faint signs of water have been found in the atmospheres of five distant planets beyond our solar system			2
the exoplanets are all scorching ‘ hot @entity9 ’ - a term given to massive worlds that orbit close to their stars			1
because they are so hot , scientists believe the planets are unlikely to support life as we know it			1
all five planets appear to be hazy			0
this illustration shows a star 's light illuminating the atmosphere of a planet to determine what ’s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet , astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star			1
when this happens , some of the star 's light passes through the planet 's atmosphere			1
this interaction imprints information on the composition and motion of the planet 's atmosphere into the star 's light			1
@entity46 can then analyse which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed to detemine whether water is present in the atmosphere of the planet			1
however , the finding still marks an important step forward in the search for alien life , the researchers said			0
‘ we 're very confident that we see a water signature for multiple planets , ’ said @entity56 of @entity58 ’s @entity57			2
‘ this work really opens the door for comparing how much water is present in atmospheres on different kinds of exoplanets — for example , hotter versus cooler ones			0
’ the presence of atmospheric water has been reported previously on exoplanets orbiting stars beyond our solar system			2
however , this is the first study to measure and compare the profiles and intensities of these signatures on multiple worlds			0
the team used @entity82 's @entity81 to analyse the atmospheres of the five planets , named @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , wasp - 19b and xo - 1b			0
to determine what ¿ s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet , astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star and look at which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed the strengths of their water signatures varied with @entity85 described as having an ‘ especially puffed - up atmosphere ’			1
‘ to actually detect the atmosphere of an exoplanet is extraordinarily difficult			2
but we were able to pull out a very clear signal , and it is water , ’ said @entity104 of the @entity105			0
to determine what ’s in the atmosphere of an exoplanet , astronomers watch the planet pass in front of its host star and look at which wavelengths of light are transmitted and which are partially absorbed			1
the water signals were all less pronounced than expected , and the scientists suspect this is because a layer of haze or dust blankets each of the five planets			0
@entity82 's high - performance @entity81 is one of few capable of peering into the atmospheres of exoplanets many trillions of miles away this haze can reduce the intensity of all signals from the atmosphere in the same way fog can make colours in a photograph appear muted			0
at the same time , haze alters the profiles of water signals and other important molecules in a distinctive way			0
‘ these studies , combined with other @entity82 observations , are showing us that there are a surprisingly large number of systems for which the signal of water is either attenuated or completely absent , ’ said @entity138 of the @entity139 in @entity140			0
‘ this suggests that cloudy or hazy atmospheres may in fact be rather common for hot @entity9			1

the planets are all scorching ‘ hot @entity9 ’ that orbit close to their stars
to detect water , astronomers watched the planets pass in front of their star
then looked at how much light could pass through planet 's atmosphere
however , because the planets are so hot , scientists believe they are unlikely to support life as we know it
