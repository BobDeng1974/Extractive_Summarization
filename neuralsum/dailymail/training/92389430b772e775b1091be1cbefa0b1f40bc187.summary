guidance from the @entity2 is seeking to reassure patients , saying the benefits of @entity5 outweigh any potential risk for women in their 50s taking medication to reduce the symptoms of the menopause is safe according to medical experts			1
they say hundreds of thousands of women have suffered unnecessarily as a result of the decade - long controversy over the effects of @entity5			1
fresh guidance from the @entity2 is seeking to reassure patients , saying the benefits of @entity5 outweigh any potential risk for women in their 50s			1
they say @entity22 should prescribe the treatment to any woman who has unpleasant menopausal symptoms , such as hot flushes and mood changes			1
@entity5 is also known to provide bone protection in later life			0
however , the debate is likely to rage on as the @entity31 continues to advise @entity5 only for women with serious menopausal symptoms for the shortest time possible			2
after five years doctors are not expected to continue prescribing it without discussing potential risks			0
uptake of @entity5 halved after two studies linked it to an increased risk of heart disease and breast cancer			0
an estimated one million women in the @entity45 stopped having the treatment			1
consultant endocrinologist dr @entity47 , from the @entity48 , said the emerging consensus was that the benefits of @entity5 outweighed the risks for most women , and that @entity22 should consider the updated @entity2 advice when treating the condition			1
speaking at the @entity54 , she said the two studies linking @entity5 to breast cancer and heart disease were scientifically unreliable			0
she said : ' the new advice is @entity5 should be used for a slightly wider age , if need be			0
if a woman has symptoms affecting the quality of her personal or professional life , then the benefits outweigh the risk			0
' the scare began in 2002 , when the @entity68 women 's health initiative study was halted three years early because researchers claimed women using @entity5 were at higher risk of breast cancer , heart disease and strokes			2
this contradicted previous – and later – research which suggested it guarded against heart problems			0
@entity5 is normally prescribed to menopausal women in their 50s , but in the @entity67 study , it was also given to women in their 60s and 70s who had gone through the menopause more than a decade earlier			2
shortly afterwards the @entity45 @entity85 , part funded by @entity87 , said @entity5 doubled breast cancer risk , but a review last year said it was ' unreliable and defective '			0
@entity87 advice remains that there is still convincing evidence that women who take @entity5 have an increased risk of breast cancer			2
but dr @entity47 said the charity was ' out of step ' and its approach had tended to ' put women off ' taking the treatment			1
some younger doctors have never prescribed @entity5 because they wrongly believe the risks outweigh the benefits , experts have warned			0
@entity106 , of @entity107 , said there was ' convincing evidence ' that women who take @entity5 have an increased risk of breast cancer , but that risk returns to normal around five years after stopping using it			2
the @entity2 guidance is also opposed to the ' arbitrary ' five year limit on treatment , and says it should be continued if symptoms persist			1
the @entity2 – a registered charity and medical foundation – receives no government funding			1
its medical advisory council comprises leading international experts in post reproductive health management , who draw up guidelines for health professionals .			0
