‘ i could n’t believe what i was hearing when she explained what had gone on , ’ the mother said			0
‘ i was tormenting myself at the thought this nurse could have continued looking after @entity19 despite doing what she did to him			2
‘ it would be considered cruel to force a dummy into a baby ’s mouth at any time , but for a nurse to do it to a baby who was struggling to breathe through his nose was not only cruel but also potentially dangerous			1
angry : @entity18 was horrified when she discovered what had happened to @entity19 in hospital a public inquiry has been launched after it was revealed up to 1,200 patients may have died because of failings in care at @entity2 ‘ i ’m so angry			1

‘ even after all the horror stories surrounding @entity2 , i never thought it was possible for something like this to happen			1
’ the pregnancy had already proved traumatic for @entity120 and partner @entity121 , 39 , before their identical twins ’ arrival at @entity124 on september 3 , her local hospital at the time she became pregnant			0
