faced with deplorable conditions at a ‘ horrendous ’ hotel in @entity2 , two lads from @entity4 tried to make the most of it by creating a hilarious video diary for their friends back home			2
the three - and - a - half minute video , titled ‘ never letting him book a hotel again ’ , offers a glimpse into every traveller ’s nightmare – dirty rooms , antiquated or broken amenities and a swimming pool no one would dare to enter			1
with scenes reminiscent of @entity22 films , the video was created by @entity23 and his friend , @entity25 , who stayed at the family - run hotel last week when they travelled to the @entity30 island for a friend ’s wedding			1
@entity23 , from @entity4 , ' swims ' in the shallow end of the pool , which does n't have any water the deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris @entity23 , a self - employed personal trainer , created the amusing video with friend @entity43 @entity23 said in the video , which has thousands of views on @entity46 and @entity47 , that he allowed @entity25 to book the room , and they thought they would be staying at a four - star hotel for three nights			1
but it did n’t live up to its billing and it did n't match the photos they saw online , as the pair were shocked to find conditions that could have made it one of the worst holidays ever			2
at the start of the tongue - in - cheek video , @entity23 tells the camera : ‘ i left all the planning to him			2
‘ he booked the accommodation and flights			0
he told me it was a four - star hotel , i was chuffed , and this little video ’s going to show you how it panned out			2
’ @entity23 's friend , @entity25 , stands under an outdoor shower , which no longer works , near the swimming pool this screen grab from the pair 's video shows the hot tub filled with stagnant water and dead flies the pair explored the hotel , including bathrooms with exposed pipes or missing toilets , in the video it shows the pair looking annoyed during a flight delay at the airport before they were ‘ squashed ’ on the plane with very little legroom			1
things got worse at the hotel , where they found an unstaffed and empty bar , and a disgusting scene inside the outdoor swimming pool			1
@entity23 , wearing his swimming trunks , decides to get a closer look at he climbs down the rickety ladder			2
the self - employed personal trainer says : ‘ i might go for a quick dip			0
do n’t mind if i do			0
it ’s lovely in here ’			0
@entity23 stands in uncut , waist - high grass on the grounds of the ' four - star ' hotel in @entity2 the lads ' hotel room overlooked a dirty car park , where a lorry was abandoned , and a busy road the camera then pans to show him ‘ swimming ’ on the floor of the shallow end of the pool , which has no water			1
it then pans even further to the deep end , which is filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris			1
they find the same problems when @entity23 checks out the hot tub			1
he sarcastically tells @entity25 : ‘ oh , ledge , i fancy a @entity131 before we play tennis			0
oh no , i think there ’s a fly in the water			0
’ later scenes show a tennis court without the net strung up , an outdoor shower that does n’t work , a depressing hotel room view of a dirt car park with an abandoned lorry , paint peeling off the walls , and lights that do n’t work or fittings that are missing altogether			1
at one point in the video @entity23 stands on the dilapidated tennis court with no nets strung up the hotel 's grounds were a fiasco , with overgrown grass and trees and dead flowers the grounds are a fiasco , with overgrown waist - high grass and trees , dead flowers and downed tree branches			1
in the end , @entity23 said , the holidaymakers got what they paid for from their £ 15 - a - night hotel room , which looked perfect online			2
he added : ' but when the taxi driver dropped us off there were no lights on at the hotel and no one at reception , so we were a bit scared and wondered what we had come to			0
the pair stayed at the hotel while they attended a friend 's wedding on the @entity30 island @entity23 said the staff were friendly but they spoke very little @entity183 , ' so it was a struggle ' to communicate ' our room was n't too bad , the sheets were clean and there was hot water , but when we looked in another bathroom there was n't even a toilet			1
' he said the hotel was ' horrendous ' , but they decided to stay as it was just for a couple of days			0
' outside it was like a ghost town , there was no one about and no atmosphere			0
the staff were friendly but could n't speak much @entity183 so it was a struggle			0
' we tried to point out the problems but they could n't really understand			0
we decided to just get on with it and make the best of it			0

@entity23 and his friend thought they were staying at a nicer hotel
they arrived to find stagnant , green water in the swimming pool
hot tub is filled with dead insects and other floating debris
amenities were antiquated or broken and paint was peeling off the walls
the grounds have uncut grass , dead flowers and downed tree branches
