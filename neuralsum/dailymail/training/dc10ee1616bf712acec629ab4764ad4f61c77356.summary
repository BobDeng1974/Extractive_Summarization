by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:44 est , 15 february 2014 a woman too heavy to leave her parents ’ basement for over two years has received a new lease of life after radical weight loss surgery			1
@entity9 , 46 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , weighed around 43st , and had not left the house since a suicide attempt in 2012 , due to a lack of mobility and weight - related depression			1
in a last - ditch effort to turn her life around , @entity9 moved to @entity19 to seek pioneering surgery from a specialist in the super morbidly obese			1
@entity9 's near 600lb frame meant she had been reliant on oxygen for 11 years and was confined to her parents basement @entity9 moved across the country to live with her brother ( pictured here with her brother 's wife ) in @entity19 in the hope of getting the surgery she needed as well as causing extreme medical problems , @entity9 's weight had made her depressed , causing her to attempt to take her own life in 2012 there , @entity9 was finally able to get the risky bariatric surgery she needed to shed the weight that had effectively been keeping her prisoner			1
previously totally dependent on her family for even her most basic needs , @entity9 had dreamed of living on her own and re-joining society			1
however her mobility was severely restricted by lymphodema : one of @entity9 's legs had ballooned , due to blockage in her lymph system , which made it very painful to move around at all			1
pre-surgery , @entity9 confessed : ‘ my body is my prison			1
i have been hiding from the world just waiting to die			0
it scares me to think that one day i might not wake up because of my weight			2
‘ sometime it feels like i 'm dead , that i 'm not alive			0
my weight is killing me			2
‘ just moving around is hard with this weight hanging over my knees			2
that ’s why i do n’t go out , i do n’t leave the house			0
‘ i want to get up and just leave but i ca n’t			0
i have n’t been out in society in two years			2
‘ if i am feeling alone , sad , depressed , food is what makes me happy because that is what comforts me			2
@entity9 being checked into hospital where she underwent life - saving bariatric surgery from dr @entity66 who specialises in weight loss surgery on the super morbidly obese ‘ i 'm eating and eating and i know that i ’m full and i can feel that i 'm full , but i ’m still eating			1
‘ if i was n’t this size i would probably be someone right now			0
i want my house , my car , my life ; i want all of that back			0
@entity9 suffered numerous health problems brought on by her weight and was dependent on breathing equipment to get enough oxygen			1
‘ for the last seven years i have been in and out of the hospital constantly for my illnesses and depression			2
‘ i have been on oxygen now for 11 years ; i sleep with it , i wake up with it , i survive with it			1
@entity9 depended on her twin sister @entity84 and mother @entity86 for food , to take her to the doctor and help her with her oxygen supplies			1
after her surgery , @entity9 spent three months in hospital recovering and having her food intake closely monitored ‘ i was afraid for her to be by herself , ’ @entity94 says , ‘ she wants to be independent but she is not in a good place right now			1
‘ @entity9 ’s reliance on her loved ones in itself took a toll on her emotionally			2
‘ i fear being a burden on my family			0
they do everything for me			0
’ bullied for her size growing up , @entity9 dropped out of high school in her senior year because she could n’t face the constant ridicule			1
however , this signalled the start of her descent into morbid obesity			0
‘ i started putting on weight in elementary school			2
it was due to bullying and molestation			0
' i was molested when i was eight and i kept it secret until i was 40			0
' as time went on i started putting on a lot of weight			2
by high school i would say i probably weigh about 250lbs			0
i just did n’t care anymore			0
putting on the weight is how i avoided people			2
’ @entity9 had gastric band surgery seven years ago but failed to lose weight			1
‘ i know they say you have to put in effort but i just gave up on myself			0
though still with a way to go on her weight loss journey , @entity9 is looking forward to her future and being more independent ‘ on a typical day i really do n’t do anything			1
it feels like these walls are closing in on me			0
‘ two years ago i gave up ; being here , being sick			2
i tried to commit suicide			0
i have never felt so low			0
in 2013 , @entity9 decided to move to @entity19 , leaving her twin sister behind for the first time ever , to live with her brother in the hope of receiving bariatric surgery from dr @entity66 , who specialises in weight loss surgery on the super morbidly obese			1
after removing the existing band in @entity147 's stomach , dr @entity66 performed a sleeve gastrectomy			0
@entity9 was left with a small , banana - shaped cavity that only allows her to eat tiny amounts at a time			1
following the operation @entity9 spent three months in hospital , dropping to 360lb ( 25st 7lb )			1
once home , @entity9 's loss slowed as she struggled to adjust to managing her diet on her own			1
however , seven months after the surgery , her weight finally dropped below 300lb , allowing her to undergo further surgery to remove the excess skin and lymphodema			1
requiring a four foot incision and over 500 blood vessels to be cut , a mass of excess tissue and skin weighing 40lb was removed			1
although @entity9 's journey from 43st 8lbs to 18st has been at times traumatic , she is now looking forward to the future for the first time in years			1
' i think another 100lb and i will probably be where i want to be , ' she says			0
the last time i felt this free was probably in grammar school			0
' @entity9 is now able to walk with the aid of a stick and is no longer dependent on oxygen cannisters			1
‘ i do things i could n’t do before : i could n’t pull up my socks , i could n’t touch my toes			0
i just want to get on with things			0
' this journey was not easy , with every pain every stitch , every tear that i cried			0
but i did n’t give up ' i have been reborn and brought back to life			0
’ @entity9 appears on my 600lb life , tuesday at 11pm on @entity190			2
