if they were really serious about meeting the mayor they would n't have called a strike in the middle of a consultation , a strike that 70 per cent of members have n't voted for			2

today , defiant @entity3 revealed he booked the holiday from an advert in the @entity275 which he reads in his local gym last - minute talks aimed at averting tonight 's strike ended without agreement but @entity3 described criticism of his @entity282 jaunt - a two week luxury cruise from @entity284 to @entity268 followed by a £ 250 a night five - star @entity286 - as ' cobblers			1
' the @entity13 firebrand said : ' my holiday was booked up way before the strike was called			2
' i spoke to people twice a day and said i would come back if needed			0
' @entity3 has faced a mounting backlash for masterminding the @entity32 strikes during his luxury holiday			1
