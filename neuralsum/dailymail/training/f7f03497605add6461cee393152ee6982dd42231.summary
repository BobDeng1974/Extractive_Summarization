by @entity0 , political correspondent @entity1 last night accused @entity2 of having a split personality over school reforms , veering between ‘ @entity5 ’ and ‘ @entity6 ’			1
the @entity7 said the deputy prime minister pandered to disaffected left - wing voters by attacking the reforms he once backed			0
it escalates an acrimonious rift in the government over schools policy since mr @entity1 decided to sack @entity16 - supporting @entity15 as head of @entity18 last week			1
schools row : education secretary @entity1 , left , accused deputy prime minister @entity2 of pandering to disaffected left - wing voters by attacking the reforms he once backed mr @entity1 said some @entity21 wanted to ‘ emphasise differences ’ within the @entity23 to appeal to former supporters ‘ who do n’t agree with the changes we are making now ’			1
‘ @entity5 , the angel on one shoulder , is saying , “ what @entity1 is doing is socially progressive , socially mobile , and in tune with good old @entity32 principles ” , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity34 , sitting on his other shoulder , is saying , “ yes ! but some of your more radical activists dislike it , so pander to them ”			0
' he will have to decide whether it ’s the good or the bad @entity5 that he indulges			0
’ it comes after @entity21 schools minister @entity41 rekindled the @entity23 row over education by confirming for the first time that he had opposed the sacking of @entity15			1
in an interview , mr @entity41 hit out at mr @entity1 over his decision to axe @entity15 from the schools regulator			1
he then opened a new rift by saying a system was needed to prevent cronyism in appointments , since any suggestion that a watchdog was pursuing a political agenda was ‘ fatal ’			2
@entity21 schools minister @entity41 rekindled the @entity23 row over education by confirming he had opposed the sacking of @entity15 mr @entity1 insisted the decision not to renew @entity15 ’s contract was not based on her politics – she is an ex-aide to @entity61 – but because he wanted a ‘ new perspective ’			1
but he refused to rule out appointing a @entity64 donor , @entity63 , who runs a chain of academies , to head the watchdog instead			0
yesterday mr @entity41 , who rarely speaks to the media , admitted he was not consulted about the move , and said he wished @entity15 had remained in post			0
‘ i do n’t think it is one of the best decisions @entity1 has ever made , ’ he told @entity71			2
‘ i personally think that @entity15 has done a fantastic job as chair of @entity18			1
i would rather she had remained and had her term renewed			0
' we just can not end up in a situation where posts of this type are selected on the basis of which political party you are in rather than your competence for the job			0
‘ while no organisation is ever going to be perfect , it is important that there should be confidence in @entity18 and it should be seen to be arm ’s length from politicians			2
' otherwise people [ working ] in schools or early years would be able to say it is pursuing an agenda that is not about educational standards			0
it has got to be independent			0
’ mr @entity41 was previously seen as united with mr @entity1 on the schools agenda , but relations between them now appear strained			2
he said that when he was told of the decision to axe @entity15 he demanded an equal say over the make - up of the panel to choose her successor			2
he also suggested the academies programme , vastly expanded by mr @entity1 , could do with more scrutiny – and called for powers for @entity18 to investigate chains of academy schools			1
academies now account for 54 per cent of state secondary schools after massive growth spearheaded by the @entity64 .			0
