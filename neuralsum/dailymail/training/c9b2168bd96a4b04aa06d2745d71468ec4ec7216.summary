soil microbes that thrive in the deserts , rainforests , prairies and forests of the world can also be found living beneath @entity9 's @entity8 , researchers have discovered			1
scientists were stunned to find thousands of different microbes in samples they analysed - the majority being new to science			2
only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils , depending on their type , had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life scientists find one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth - in the soil of @entity9 's @entity8			1
they analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across @entity8 ’s 843 acres the types of plants and animals that are able to live in a particular biome , like the desert , are largely determined by the climate			1
but microbes appear to be more concerned about the environment in the soil , such as the acidity and the carbon availability , than how hot or dry the climate is			2
this allows diverse microbial communities to thrive wherever the soil conditions are equally diverse - such as in @entity8			1
' we found thousands of different organisms , and it was shocking how few had ever been described , ' said @entity45 of @entity46 , who led the study			0
' not only do they not have a name , but we do n't know anything about them			0
' we do n't know what sort of conditions they like to live under or what role they may play in soil habitat and soil fertility			0
' the research team analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across @entity8 ’s 843 acres and discovered a stunning diversity of below - ground life , most of which had never been documented before			1
the team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath @entity8 is similar to the biodiversity found across the world , from the frozen @entity70 tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between			1
only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils , depending on their type , had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life , according to the study results published today in the journal @entity80 ' if you want to find unique diversity and if you want to find a wide range of different below - ground organisms , you do n't have to travel around the world , ' said @entity45 , who is also a fellow at the @entity87			0
' you can walk across @entity8			0

this allows diverse microbial communities to thrive wherever the soil conditions are equally diverse			1
the only area that did not have soil microbial communities that overlapped with the samples taken from @entity8 was @entity106 , where @entity107 has done extensive research			1
' no one would ever expect to find an overlap in the types of trees we see in @entity8 and the type of trees we see in a tropical forest , ' @entity45 said			0
' but that does n't seem to be true for the microbes living in the soil			0
we found all these community types just within @entity8			2
' below - ground biodiversity does n't follow the same rules as the plants and animals living above ground			0
' ' the soil microbes in @entity8 benefit us , benefit soil health , and are linked tightly to the beauty of the trees and other plants we see , ' said professor @entity107			2
the team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath @entity8 is similar to the biodiversity found across the world , from the frozen @entity70 tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between			2
' the nation 's food , cities , clean air and water and economy are all dependent on healthy , fertile soils and that motivates us to understand this fascinating hidden life beneath our feet			0
' the scientists also compared the below - ground biodiversity in @entity8 to 52 soil samples taken from locations spanning the globe , from @entity155 to @entity106			1

research team analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across @entity8 ’s 843 acres
only 16 *%* of the microbes found were known to science
the one area that did not have soil microbial communities that overlapped with the samples taken from @entity8 was @entity106
