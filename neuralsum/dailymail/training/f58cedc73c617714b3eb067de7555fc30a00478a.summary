by @entity0 published : 03:38 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 13:13 est , 25 june 2012 rise : transport secretary @entity1 said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty motorists will almost certainly have to pay 3.02p more for their fuel at the pumps to help pay - off @entity10 's debts , a senior minister has admitted			1
transport secretary @entity1 said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty expected to come into effect in august			1
it means already cash - strapped families will have to fork out more than £ 1.40 a litre for petrol - most of which is tax			1
the move also sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel protests similar to those seen in september 2000 when petrol pumps ran dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country 's motorway networks			1
miss @entity1 she said wants to focus on pushing petrol companies to slash the cost of fuel at the pumps , to bring it in line with the falling cost of oil globally			1
former treasury minister @entity36 told the @entity37 said : ' the taxes that we get in fund the public services that we all rely on			0
' surely it ’s better to challenge the petrol retailers to pass on reductions to motorists and actually i think that ’s probably the most important thing to do			0
' at present , 57.95p is taken in fuel duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded			1
@entity54 adds another 20 per cent - around 24p at current prices			0
if the fuel duty rise is rubber stamped , it will mean almost 61p out of every litre of bought will go in duty			1
fuel duty and @entity54 has kept petrol prices artificially high despite the falling cost of crude oil , although petrol prices have fallen this month by 4p for the second month running			1
also , today three supermarkets , @entity68 , @entity66 's and @entity67 vowed to slash the price of fuel at the forecourt passing on savings to customers from falling oil prices			2
breakdown of the cost of fuel from august when a 3.02p increase will be applied miss @entity1 said it was important that the @entity78 focus on cutting the deficit in light of what is happening to some countries in @entity83			1
ministers will be left to find £ 1.5billion to plug the income gap if the fuel duty rise is pulled			1
however , the prime minister is under pressure to ditch the fuel price rise from senior ministers who have voiced concern that it will damage support for the @entity93 from poorer voters			2
ideas under consideration include cutting the 3p rise to 1p or 2p , or deferring part or all of the rise until next spring			0
going up : how the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising even although for the past year the cost of brent ( crude ) oil has fallen , but prices have remained high as of just a few days ago , 50 mps , including seven @entity93 , have now signed a @entity111 motion calling for the price rise to be scrapped			1
@entity68 is cutting the price of petrol			0
from tomorrow customers at @entity68 ’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than 127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel			2
@entity68 said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since february 2011			2
the latest cut means @entity68 has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel since the end of april , reducing the cost of filling up a family car by almost £ 10			1
@entity66 ’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too , with petrol and diesel coming down ' by up to 2p per litre ' from tomorrow			1
the @entity132 said the 14p @entity68 reduction since april was welcome			0
while @entity68 had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale , the @entity10 average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-april			2
@entity67 is also dropping prices , with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow			2
they were joined by leading businessmen , with the boss of @entity68 also demanding the tax hike is cancelled			0
this week , the @entity148 will also try and force the @entity149 to scrap the duty rise by forcing a vote as the @entity10 budget complete the final stages of its passage through @entity156			0
the @entity158 @entity157 has backed cross-party action to scrap the hike			0
chief executive @entity161 said it would be ' a welcome boost for businesses which are having to contend with high transportation and utility costs at a time when domestic demand remains subdued '			0
but @entity168 , the chief secretary to the treasury , has played down hopes of progress			0
he said last week : ‘ right now , taxation on fuel is 10p a litre less than it would have been if @entity175 ’s plans had been in place			2
' but given the huge issues we have with public finances , we also need to make sure that we ’ve got the money coming through the tax system , and the increase in fuel duty is part of that			0
' june 's @entity186 shows that , since mid-may , average @entity10 petrol prices have fallen 4.63p a litre , from 138.40 to 133.77			0
this is on top of the 4.08p - a - litre fall the previous month and is the biggest monthly drop since the petrol price dived 5.4p a litre between mid-november and mid-december 2008			1
pricey : ministers will be left to find £ 1.5bnillion to plug the income gap if the fuel duty rise is pulled and miss @entity1 said it was important to focus on the deficit even so , the overall 8.71p - a - litre reduction in the pump price petrol since the 142.48p record on april 16 is still short of where it should be , the motoring group said			1
under government pressure to make pump prices transparent , the fuel industry will have to prove in the future that @entity10 drivers are paying a fair price for fuel , the @entity132 said			0
in the past month , the average pump price of diesel has fallen 4.99p a litre , from 144.30p in mid may to 139.31 now			0
but @entity10 diesel costs at least 4p a litre more than in @entity83 .			0

@entity1 wants to push petrol companies to slash the cost of fuel at the pumps instead
rise will be 3.02p per litre from august
it means cash - strapped families could have to fork out £ 1.40 per litre of petrol
