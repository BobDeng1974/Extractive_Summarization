by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:33 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 27 february 2013 a @entity3 magazine has sparked controversy by booking a white model for an ' african queen ' fashion shoot - then heavily bronzing her face and body to make her appear black			1
@entity2 chose to use blonde - haired , blue - eyed industry darling @entity11 , 16 , for the shoot - which features in the march issue - despite then making her up as a black model			1
the editorial - shot by photographer @entity16 - also sees @entity11 dressed in ' traditional ' prints , with make - up done by artist @entity19			1
critics have now slammed the magazine for using the @entity23 teenager , saying that if they wanted a black model they should have simply hired one			2
@entity11 in the @entity27 photo shoot in which her body and face appear to have been blackened @entity31 's @entity30 points out that @entity32 , the agency representing @entity11 , has several black models on its roster , but instead the magazine opted to employ a white girl			1
saying there was ' no excuse ' for the move , she added : ' it 's impossible to look at this and not ache for young women of color who want to pursue careers in modeling			0
if jobs for " @entity7 " photo spreads are n't going to black women , what hope is there ? ' commenting on @entity31 , one user named ' fashionlady ' wrote : ' can i just say as a young black model ( i 'm a girl ) having worked my ass for the past three years , this hurts my soul			0
' @entity58 users were also outraged by the move			0
@entity60 tweeted : ' ‏ @ @entity62 over it ! just book a blk model ! ? ! no ? ? ' @entity64 tweeted , ' innovative ? more like ignorant , ' with @entity65 adding , ' new low in the world of # fashion , ' and @entity68 saying : ' @entity11 , is not an african queen			2
this is not artistic expression			0
' @entity11 , 16 , in her @entity32 model headshot , left , and on the catwalk , right @entity76 issued a response to criticism , stating : ' the artistic statement of the photographer @entity16 , author of this editorial , is in line with his previous photographic creations , which insist on the melting pot and the mix of cultures , the exact opposite of any skin color based discrimination			1
' @entity2 has always supported the artistic freedom of the talented photographers who work with the magazine to illustrate its pages , and has not took part in the creation process of this editorial			1
' for its part , @entity76 , which has the utmost respect for this photographer ’s creative work , firmly excludes that the latest may have had , at any moment , the intention to hurt readers ’ sensitivity , whatever their origin			0
' @entity76 considers that it has regularly demonstrated its deep attachment to the promotion of different skin - colored models			0
' for instance , the next issue of @entity2 for man on sale on 15th march has the black model @entity113 on the cover page , and the current @entity117 edition ’s cover of our magazine features the black model @entity121 on its cover			1
' this demonstrates the completely inappropriate nature of the accusations made against our magazine , deeply committed to the respect for differences , tolerance and more generally to non-discrimination			0
' considering the turmoil caused by this publication , the @entity132 would like to apologize to anyone who may have been offended by this editorial			0
' @entity137 : ' 16 year - old white model @entity11			2
black girls ca n’t even get work as @entity141 ... @entity142 : if i ever see @entity11 on the street i am throwing eggs at her for wearing blackface ... @entity147 : if you 're going to fetishise " @entity141 " ( a massive continent ) you could use a woman of colour as your model			1
. @entity153 ugh @entity154 : @entity76 # 141 march 2013 @entity11 : it does matter if you 're @entity158 @entity2 also courted controversy in october 2010 when white @entity3 model @entity160 posed as a mother to a black child			1
several other brands have featured racially questionable editorial			0
in 2006 @entity165 posed for @entity166 wearing nothing but black paint covering , and in 2010 , @entity169 posed for @entity170 with a black face , yellow wig and brown bodypaint			0
in 2012 , make - up brand @entity175 featured a black - faced white model and this is n't the first time that model @entity11 has been involved in a controversial shoot			1
the @entity23 teenager has been embroiled in a number of underage modelling fiascos , including when she walked for @entity185 at the age of 14 and appeared in @entity187 before her 16th birthday , seemingly flouting the magazine 's policy not to employ models under 16			2
@entity192 later claimed the spread had been commercial and therefore out of their jurisdiction .			2
