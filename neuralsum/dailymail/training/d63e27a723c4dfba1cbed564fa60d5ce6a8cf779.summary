football agents are threatening to injunct the @entity1 from introducing new @entity3 regulations in april , following world football ’s ruling body washing their hands of controlling the game ’s middlemen			1
the @entity9 met on friday and will take legal action against the fresh set of rules governing their conduct			1
that is if their complaint to the @entity17 and a couple of planned meetings in @entity20 fail to resolve the turmoil			0
@entity22 , chairman of the @entity9 that represents almost all the @entity24 ’s agents , said : ‘ we will have no option			2
it ’s a total disgrace that @entity3 are passing the buck to national associations having recommended an unworkable code			1
and it will be the @entity31 out there , with anyone able to act as agents			2
’ @entity36 's ( right ) agent @entity35 ( left ) could soon have to adhere to a new set of regulations @entity22 , chairman of the @entity9 , insists agents will have no option but to take legal action against the @entity1 the @entity3 recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ‘ impeccable character ’ , all deals annually published online , agents ’ fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under 18			1
the @entity1 , @entity50 and @entity51 have been discussing how best to cope with @entity3 opting out			1
all have serious concerns about how the system will work in @entity24 and abroad , especially in under - developed football territories			0
a @entity3 spokesperson said : ‘ the new approach is about having better control of the activity and follows a lengthy , in - depth reform process with numerous options considered			1
’ @entity61 's @entity3 has decided to opt out of trying to control football agents there is no chance whatsoever of @entity65 , 70 - year - old chief executive of the @entity66 , being asked to resign by his management committee — be it for running up huge bookmaking debts or making deplorable comparisons this week between the @entity72 disaster and the @entity74 case			1
@entity65 surrounds himself with ultra-loyal staff at his private fiefdom			1
@entity77 , the former @entity1 compliance officer who was brought in for a period by @entity80 owner @entity79 to stabilise the troubled club , is himself facing a £ 100,000 pension fraud charge in @entity83 on january 19			2
@entity77 will vigorously defend the charge , brought by @entity85			0
he will claim to have been victim of a pension scam by a professional advisor who has fled the country after being struck off by the @entity90			0
@entity91 , who have rights to the @entity94 starting on january 17 , will be producing all their programming from @entity96 — sending no one abroad			1
@entity99 players train ahead of the @entity94 - @entity91 will not be sending anyone to the tournament yet the @entity102 are spending licence - fee money funding an army of over 20 personnel			1
they will be going to @entity107 to service the overblown website , @entity109 and the @entity110			0
the @entity112 ’s @entity96 embassy report numerous visa applications from the @entity102			2
there is a worry at the top of @entity117 that the @entity118 will lose one of their flagship rights properties this year			0
the two most vulnerable are @entity122 highlights and the open championship			2
the golf contract is most in danger of being lost to @entity126 after 2016 — which @entity127 was the first to reveal as a significant threat last july			0
one thing is for sure			0
if @entity126 do capture the @entity132 , there will be no more ridiculous schedule clashing with the @entity134 , which happens again this summer			2
@entity135 won @entity132 at @entity136 live on the @entity102 last year but the tournament could be on @entity126 in 2016 there has been an understandably negative reaction in @entity140 to flu - hit @entity141 pulling out of saturday 's @entity143 cross-country international			1
it is the third time in less than six months he has let down athletics fans north of the border , following his withdrawals from @entity151 ’s @entity150 meeting and the @entity152			0
meanwhile , @entity153 would like to see cross country included in the @entity155 to encourage @entity107 interest			0
@entity157 , from @entity153 ’s first athletics club @entity159 ’s @entity158 , represented @entity160 in cross country the last time it was included — 1924			0
@entity141 's withdrawal from the @entity143 cross-country international has caused a stir if departing chairman @entity168 fails to win enough county support to stay on the @entity170 in a new president ’s role , @entity167 chairman @entity166 , a @entity96 lawyer , will challenge @entity174 ’ @entity173 for the vice-chairmanship vacated by @entity176 succeeding @entity168 .			0
