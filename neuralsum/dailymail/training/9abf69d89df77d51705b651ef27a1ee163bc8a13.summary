by @entity0 published : 16:55 est , 3 february 2013 updated : 16:55 est , 3 february 2013 dreamliners are still grounded because of unsafe batteries , but restrictions against flying with such batteries as cargo have recently been lifted			1
pilots and safety advocates say the situation does n't make sense			0
if the @entity13 's battery system is too risky to allow the planes to fly , then it 's too risky to ship the same batteries as cargo on airliners , they said			1
no fly zone : @entity19 saw its new 787 ' @entity21 ' plane grounded worldwide after a @entity22 787 caught fire in @entity24 jan. 7 and an @entity21 ( pictured ) was forced into an emergency landing jan. 16 the planes were grounded worldwide nearly three weeks ago after their lithium ion batteries to a fire in one aircraft and smoke in another			1
but new rules exempt aircraft batteries from the ban on large lithium ion batteries as cargo on flights by passenger planes			1
in effect , that means the @entity21 's batteries are now allowed to fly only if they 're not attached to a @entity21			1
the regulations were published on jan. 7 , the same day as a battery fire in a @entity22 787 parked at @entity24 's @entity43 that took firefighters nearly 40 minutes to put out			2
the timing of the two events appears coincidental			0
' these incidents have raised the whole issue of lithium batteries and their use in aviation , ' said @entity53 , a former @entity54 chairman			2
' any transport of lithium batteries on commercial aircraft for any purpose should be suspended until ( an ) @entity54 investigation is complete and we know more about this entire issue			2
' holding pattern : dreamliners at @entity64 are currently grounded ( pictured ) , as they are across the globe , for problems arising from their large onboard lithium batteries @entity68 , a former @entity69 pilot famed for his precision flying that enabled passengers and crew to survive an emergency landing on the @entity74 in @entity75 , said in an interview that he would n't be comfortable flying an airliner that carried lithium ion aircraft batteries in its cargo hold			1
' the potential for self - ignition , for uncontained fires , is huge , ' he said			0
the new regulations ' need to be looked at very hard in the cold light of day , particularly with what has happened with the 787 batteries			2
' sad debut : a @entity88 stewardess poses in the long - awaited new jet 's business class section just before problems with the plane 's lithium ion batteries cut its debut short the battery rules were changed in order to conform @entity99 shipping requirements with international standards as required by @entity101 , the federal @entity95 said in a statement			1
flight risk : seen here in publicity animation , the @entity21 has batteries that are lighter than most jets ' but experts wonder if it comes at the cost of safety the @entity111 , a @entity112 agency that sets global aviation standards , adopted the aircraft battery cargo exemption in october 2011 , and it went into effect jan. 1			2
the organization 's standards normally are n't binding			0
but a provision inserted into @entity99 law at the behest of the battery industry and their shippers says the rules ca n't be stricter than the @entity112 agency 's standards			0
previously , @entity99 regulations prohibited the shipment of lithium ion batteries on passenger planes in packages weighing more than 11 pounds , although heavier batteries could be shipped on cargo planes			1
the new rules allow the shipment of lithium ion batteries weighing as much as 77 pounds , but only if they are aircraft batteries			1
shipments of other lithium ion batteries greater than 11 pounds are still prohibited			1
the 787 's two batteries weigh 63 pounds each			1
it 's the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries , which weigh less and store more power than other batteries of a similar size			1
the aircraft battery exemption was created for the convenience of the airline industry , which wants to be able to quickly ship replacement batteries to planes whose batteries are depleted or have failed			0
sometimes it 's faster to do that using a passenger plane			2
the @entity54 is investigating the cause of the 787 battery fire in @entity24			0
@entity157 authorities are investigating a battery failure that led to an emergency landing by an @entity160 787 on jan. 16			2
all @entity161 , which are operated by eight airlines in seven countries , have since been grounded			0
the @entity164 , which represents @entity99 airlines and other carriers that fly internationally , asked for the aircraft battery exemption at the october 2011 meeting of the @entity112 agency 's dangerous goods committee			2
some fearful : some say the new regulations allowing jets to carry big lithium batteries , like the ones that grounded two @entity161 , are risky the association argued that the exemption would give airlines ' significant operational flexibility in being able to move aircraft batteries on a passenger aircraft where cargo aircraft may not be available over the route , or within the time required if a battery is required at short notice , ' according to a copy of the request obtained by @entity189			1
since the batteries have to meet special safety standards in order to be installed on planes , ' it is believed that exceeding the ( 11 - pound ) limit for passenger aircraft will not compromise safety , ' the request said			2
some members of the committee opposed allowing shipments of lithium ion aircraft batteries on passenger planes , saying safety regulations that let the batteries be used onboard planes do n't necessarily ensure they can be transported safely as cargo , according to a summary of the meeting posted online by the @entity112 agency			1
' one member had discussed this proposal with an engineer in their ( country 's ) airworthiness office who was familiar with standards for batteries installed in aircraft , ' the summary said			2
' this colleague did not believe testing standards for installed aircraft batteries warranted special treatment for transport purposes			0
' it was pointed out that the safety standards applied to batteries used in the operation of an aircraft are ' narrowly tailored to performance issues and how the battery interacted with aircraft systems , ' the summary said			0
the summary does n't identify the committee member , but a source familiar with the deliberations said it was the @entity99 representative , @entity236			0
she abstained from the vote on the standards , said a federal official with knowledge of the meeting			0
neither source was authorized to comment publicly and both spoke only on condition of anonymity			0
more to come : a forthcoming model from @entity247 will also carry the lithium batteries some fear are too dangerous for use , or even transport , aboard passenger jets the @entity22 fire ignited about half an hour after the plane had landed in @entity24 and nearly 200 passengers and crew members had disembarked			1
firefighters were alerted after a cleaning crew working in the plane smelled smoke			0
it took nearly 40 minutes to put out the fire			0
the ' multiple systems ' that were designed to prevent the 787 's batteries from catching fire ' did not work as intended , ' @entity263 , the current @entity54 chairman , told reporters recently			2
the ' expectation in aviation is never to experience a fire on an aircraft , ' she said			0
concern about transport of lithium ion aircraft batteries on passenger planes is n't limited to the batteries used in the 787			1
the @entity277 , expected to be ready next year , will also make extensive use of lithium ion batteries			1
aircraft manufacturers are also considering retrofitting some planes to replace their batteries with lithium ion batteries to save weight , according to the airline association			1
the less a plane weighs , the less fuel it burns			0
fuel is the biggest operating expense of most airlines			0
cargo airline pilots long have complained about the dangers of transporting lithium batteries			0
the batteries are suspected of causing or contributing to the severity of an onboard fire that led to the september 2010 crash of a @entity299 plane near @entity300 , killing both pilots			0
the two pilots of another @entity299 plane barely managed to escape the aircraft before it was consumed by fire moments after landing in @entity306 in 2006			0
lithium - ion batteries can short circuit and ignite if they are improperly packaged , damaged or have manufacturing defects			1
fires involving rechargeable lithium - ion batteries can reach 1,100 degrees , close to the melting point of aluminum , a key material in the construction of most airliners .			1

@entity19 's 787 is still grounded because of fears the lithium ion batteries is unsafe to fly
however , federal authorities have revised previously laws to allow similar batteries to be transported aboard passenger jets
