by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 _ as @entity4 seal the £ 16m signing of @entity7 defender @entity6 , it seems fitting to reflect on the club ’s rather combustible previous associations with @entity11 footballers			1
there have been only three - @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15			1
one has been cast as one of sir @entity19 ’s greatest misjudgments , another attempted to engineer a move to @entity21 and the third musketeer ended up at @entity23			2
@entity4 will hope that @entity6 - whose surname in @entity25 means ‘ red ’ or ‘ fiery ’ - will prove rather less problematic ... @entity11 : @entity6 will be the fourth man from the @entity28 nation to play for @entity4 @entity13 when did he sign ? in the summer of 2001 , @entity4 spent £ 28.1m on @entity11 superstar @entity13			1
@entity19 said : ’ what we have done is bring in a really top player , one of the best players in the world			0
he is world class - a fantastic footballer			0
@entity13 will bring a personality to the team which i feel we need at this moment			1
’ delighted : sir @entity19 was full of praise for his new man @entity13 in 2001 how did it begin ? @entity13 ’s early form was impressive , as the @entity11 scored against @entity45 , @entity46 and memorably , the fourth goal of that famous comeback as @entity4 defeated @entity49 5 - 3 at @entity50			1
watch back the showreels of @entity13 ’s passing and finishing and you can not dispute his talent			2
good star : the @entity11 started well for @entity4 following his arrival what went wrong ? sadly , it also coincided with a nightmare season for @entity4 , in which sir @entity19 ’s side had lost six matches before @entity63 and sank to 9th in the table			1
he struggled to adapt to the rigours of @entity68 football , although some of his performances in @entity71 were outstanding			0
two seasons on , as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 continued to outshine the @entity11 , @entity13 was sold to @entity76 for £ 15m			1
trouble : but it quickly went wrong for him as @entity4 struggle badly that season what sir @entity19 said : ‘ @entity13 was capable of exceptional football and was talented			1
but , at times , he found the @entity81 a bit difficult			0
he was a @entity83 player and that was where we got our best form from him			0
’ famous faces : @entity13 celebrates with @entity89 during a @entity91 match what @entity13 said : ‘ @entity19 trusted me when i first arrived			2
but later on it seemed we did n’t understand each other as well			0
there were times when i felt he preferred some of my team - mates			0
’ tussle : @entity13 tries to get the ball off @entity76 's @entity101 during a 2 - 1 win at @entity103 in 2001 @entity14 when did he sign ? now 10 years ago , @entity14 was a £ 7m acquisition from @entity105 in the summer of 2004			1
also signed that summer : @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
how did it begin ? the @entity11 made a promising start to life at @entity103 , scoring on his debut at @entity45 and named as the club ’s @entity114 at the end of his first campaign			1
supporters admired his all - action , committed approach , flying down the left - flank from full - back			0
@entity125 : @entity14 signed for @entity4 for £ 7million in 2004 battler : @entity14 challenges @entity21 forward @entity127 at @entity128 what went wrong ? @entity14 suffered a serious injury at the beginning of his second season at @entity4 and in truth , he never really recovered			1
@entity134 was signed as cover in the january and the @entity136 established himself as @entity19 ’s first - choice at left - back			0
the following season brought reduced opportunities and in the summer of 2007 , @entity14 demanded a move away from the club			1
a £ 6.8m bid came in from @entity21 and @entity14 argued that @entity4 had agreed to sell him to any club that matched that valuation			1
ultimately , the case went to a @entity81 tribunal and @entity14 even recruited @entity21 ’s solicitor , @entity148 , to work on his behalf			2
the @entity81 ruled in @entity4 ’s favour and @entity19 shipped @entity14 out of the back door to @entity152			1
cheer up ! @entity14 tries to lighten the mood of a downbeat @entity106 during training in 2006 what sir @entity19 said : ‘ a lot of fans will be asking what all this was about but it started a long time ago			2
‘ i was disappointed with @entity158 from the time he joined us because he chose to play for @entity161 in the @entity162 in @entity163 in 2004 and did n’t come to us until the end of that september			0
‘ his first season was fantastic but the day before he got his bad injury his agent came to our hotel and asked if we could sell @entity158			0
after one year i thought it was an absolutely distressing signal to put out			0
‘ we allowed him to train in @entity25 and really he prepared to have himself fit to represent @entity161 in the @entity170 , which we could n’t do anything about			0
glory : @entity14 did have some good moments at @entity4 , including being named @entity114 ‘ we were not happy especially as he came back unfit from the @entity170			1
‘ meanwhile all through that time his agents kept having meetings with ( chief executive ) @entity177 asking to leave or double his money			0
‘ they wanted him to be the top - paid player , which is absolutely ridiculous given the quality of forward players we have			0
’ what @entity14 said : ‘ i am convinced @entity19 would not have given me a minute all season			2
i deserved better treatment after my efforts for the club			0
i thank the @entity4 fans - but they are very different to the directors			2
’ has the relationship recovered ? from the chants of ‘ @entity192 ’ that @entity14 was formerly greeted with by the @entity193 , it then became ‘ @entity194 ’ when the defender faced @entity4 with @entity196 in 2011			1
@entity14 has since said : ‘ i do n’t have many regrets from my career as a footballer , but that episode with @entity19 [ has ] to be one of them			2
i ’m impulsive and strong - willed and this has got me into trouble at times , which was the case when i left @entity4			1
’ fierce : but he lost support from @entity4 fans after trying to engineer a move to @entity21 @entity15 when did he sign ? @entity15 signed in the summer of 2007 on a complicated two - year loan deal after he arrived into @entity68 football with @entity212			1
how did it begin ? @entity4 won the @entity81 and @entity91 in @entity15 ’s first season at the club , as the @entity11 formed a potent partnership with @entity106 and @entity217			1
his indefatigable style appealed greatly to @entity4 followers			2
superstar : @entity15 played for two seasons at @entity4 from 2007 - 09 what went wrong ? the signing of @entity224 limited opportunities and left @entity15 a exasperated			1
@entity4 were slow to take up the option to sign @entity15 permanently and speculation grew that he would leave the club at the end of the season for @entity21 or @entity23			1
eventually , he decided to leave and make one of the most controversial transfers in @entity81 history to the @entity234			0
what @entity4 said : ‘ the club agreed to pay the option price of £ 25.5m and offered @entity15 a five - year contract which would have made him one of its highest - paid players			1
‘ disappointingly , however , his advisers informed the club that , despite the success he has enjoyed during one of the club ’s most successful periods , he does not wish to continue playing for @entity4			2
’ glittering : he won two premier @entity247 and a @entity91 during that time famous night : @entity15 ( left ) celebrates with his team - mates after their famous win in @entity251 in 2008 what sir @entity19 said : in his autobiography , the former @entity4 manager wrote : ‘ i brought @entity15 on at half - time [ in the @entity256 final ] and just felt he was playing for himself a little bit			1
from what i could gather , he had already made his mind up before joining @entity23			0
‘ the rumour , not confirmed , was that our @entity262 rivals had paid £ 47million			0
to me these were incredible sums			0
to me he was an impact player			0
’ all smiles : @entity15 sharing a laugh with sir @entity19 in training before their relationship soured what @entity15 said : after @entity23 won the title in 2012 , @entity15 held up a sign that read ‘ @entity271 ’			2
he was quoted by the @entity272 to have told an @entity11 publication : ‘ it seems like @entity19 is the president of @entity68			2
when he speaks badly about a player , nobody says he has to apologise but when someone comes out with a joke , you have to say sorry			0
i do n’t say sorry			0
there ’s no relationship at all between me and @entity19			0
’ preferred : the manager favoured new signing @entity224 , which forced @entity15 out of the door sign me up : @entity15 lets his feelings known to the @entity103 hierarchy after scoring in 2009 @entity291 reach deal for @entity6			1

defender @entity6 set for a £ *16million* move to @entity4
red *devils* have had combustible relationships with @entity11 's past
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 all had *indifferent* times during their careers at @entity103
