both @entity24 and coach @entity53 have adamantly denied any involvement			0
eleven of the 12 ' @entity56 balls ' were under - inflated , though only one was two pounds below the required @entity58 of 12.5 while the others were below by only a small amount			1

' now a separate investigation by @entity8 is alleging that a locker room attendant was involved in attempted to have an ' unapproved ball ' put into play on the field			1
as soon as the move was noticed , the @entity71 vice president of game operations was notified			0
source it 's believed @entity12 has been in charge of the officials ' locker room at @entity22 for the last seven years and has worked @entity1 games for even longer			1
the @entity8 investigation suggested that @entity12 tried to give an unapproved football to an alternate official who was in charge of the special - teams footballs			1
the growing storm over the team 's use of illegal balls , which is being referred to as ' deflate-gate , ' dominated the buildup to the february 1st @entity33			0
under @entity40 rules , game balls must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch and no alteration is allowed once they are approved			2
@entity1 quarterback @entity24 threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped			0
both @entity24 and @entity1 head coach @entity53 have professed innocence regarding the deflated ball issue and said they knew nothing about it until the following monday , after the game			2
before every @entity40 game , footballs are inspected and measured by @entity40 officials in their locker room before they can be approved for in - game use			1

' team owner @entity159 , in a strong defense of his head coach and quarterback @entity24 , said : ' i want to make it clear that i believe unconditionally that the @entity1 have done nothing inappropriate in this process or are in violation of @entity40 rules			0
' as the @entity40 's investigation into ' deflate-gate ' continues , the spotlight of suspicion remains firmly fixed on the @entity1 with some fans even questioning why @entity1 was allowed to play in the @entity33 at all			2
but the @entity1 are not stranger to controversy and have developed a reputation as a team not above a bit of skullduggery			0
in 2007 , coach @entity53 was fined $ 500,000 and the @entity1 lost a first - round draft pick after an investigation found @entity1 had videotaped an opponent 's signals on the sidelines in what became known as ' @entity217 ' .			0
