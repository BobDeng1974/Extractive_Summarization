a church has banned a yoga class from using its hall because of its links with ' alternative spiritualities '			1
instructor @entity5 has been told by church leaders at @entity7 in @entity8 that she will have to find another venue – even though she has used the hall for nine years			1
in a letter , the parochial church council told her that yoga 's roots ' lie in thinking that is not compatible with the @entity18 faith '			2
not welcome any more ... yoga instructor @entity5 has been told by chiefs at @entity7 in @entity8 that she will have to find another venue – even though she has used their hall for nine years her students have been left angry at the decision , telling the church the twice - weekly evening classes at @entity27 have no religious content whatsoever			1
ms @entity5 , said the decision was made despite church leaders never observing one of her sessions			1
in a letter to her , the parish of @entity33 and @entity34 said yoga fell foul of a new ban on groups linked to ' alternative spiritualities '			0
' we are aware that yoga can be practised as either an exercise class or as a spiritual discipline and anywhere in between , however we understand that its roots lie in thinking that it is not compatible with the @entity18 faith and the @entity18 faith has not appropriated yoga , ' the letter stated			0
' the parish church council recently passed a resolution stating that we would no longer take either new or continuing bookings for groups practising " alternative spiritualities "			0
' ms @entity5 , 39 , from @entity56 , has until the end of the month to find alternative premises and avoid letting down her 30 students			1
angry : ms @entity5 , said the decision was made despite church leaders never observing one of her sessions in a statement , the @entity64 said yoga was a ' spiritual activity whose roots are not @entity70 - centred '			1
' all of our buildings are open to and used by a wide range of groups from the local community , ' the @entity64 said			2
' the primary purpose of these buildings is the worship of @entity79 as revealed in the person of @entity70			1
' yoga means the union of " mind , body and spirit "			0
by definition , therefore , @entity81 is a spiritual activity whose roots are not @entity70 centred			2
' we are confident we have acted legally and have waived the last nine months of @entity5 's fees , amounting to nearly £ 1,000			0
' we are surprised at the actions currently being taken			0
whilst we understand that @entity5 would not agree with our decision , in december 2014 she informed us that we had reached an agreeable compromise with regard to her notice period			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity98 said : ' decisions on who can lease church buildings lie entirely within the remit of the relevant parochial church council ( @entity103 ) in each case			0
' the diocese of @entity8 therefore supports the @entity103 of @entity33 and @entity106 in exercising its responsibility in deciding to cease bookings for a yoga class in @entity110			2

@entity5 told her yoga class is banned as it 's not ' @entity70 - centred '
ms @entity5 , 39 , has until the end of the month to find alternative premises
@entity64 says primary use of its buildings is ' the worship of @entity79 '
