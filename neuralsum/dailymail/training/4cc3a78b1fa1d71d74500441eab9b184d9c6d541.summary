by @entity0 published : 03:00 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 21:38 est , 2 april 2013 more than 100 conservative backbenchers have written to @entity2 demanding legislation guaranteeing a referendum on @entity6 ’s future in @entity7 after 2015			1
the prime minister , who pledged earlier this year that he would offer voters an in / out referendum if he wins the next election , is under increasing pressure from mps to put forward an ‘ enabling ’ @entity14 in this @entity15			2
several ministers and junior members of the government are thought to be backing the idea , although only backbench mps signed this week ’s letter			2
@entity2 's landmark promise of a referendum on @entity6 's membership of the @entity25 depends on the being able to claw back powers from @entity27 @entity28 insists it would be impossible to introduce a @entity29 , as the @entity30 will not back a referendum			1
but eurosceptic @entity32 say a @entity34 vote on the issue before the general election in 2015 is vital to prove the party means to honour its pledge – and embarrass @entity39 and @entity40 , who oppose the idea			0
@entity42 , the mp who organised the letter , said : ‘ we are going to be looking for all opportunities to raise this on the floor of the @entity48			0
over 100 conservative colleagues and i have urged him to bring the enabling legislation forward in this @entity15			0
@entity53 president @entity52 and @entity55 chancellor @entity54 have rejected mr @entity2 's review of @entity27 ' powers as a @entity6 ' political exercise ' @entity2 last year set out a detailed timetable for staging a historic referendum on @entity6 's membership of the @entity25			1
‘ this would address the lack of public trust			0
when people hear politicians making promises about an @entity25 referendum , they do n’t know whether to believe them			1
' the legislation offers the chance to convince the electorate			0
the referendum promise has to be credible and believable			0
’ mr @entity2 sent shockwaves through @entity7 when he gave a guarantee of an in / out vote on our membership if he is prime minister after 2015			1
he vowed to campaign for @entity6 to stay in – as long as @entity27 agreed to renegotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship and return key powers to @entity80			1
and he has insisted that a referendum held by the end of 2017 would be a deal - breaker in any future coalition deal with the @entity30			2
a @entity28 source said : ‘ there are n’t any plans for legislation this side of the election , as opposed to afterwards , since it ’s quite difficult to introduce a @entity14 if one part of the government does n’t support it			0
‘ we have said that it is a red line for @entity2			1
if he is prime minister after the next election , there will be a referendum in the next @entity15			0

@entity54 and @entity52 refuse to *co-operate* with the @entity6
*balance* of *competences* study is looking at where the @entity25 *interferes*
