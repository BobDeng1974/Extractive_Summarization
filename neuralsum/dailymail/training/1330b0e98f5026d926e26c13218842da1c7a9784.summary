even @entity1 ’s tracksuit carried the marks of battle on saturday evening			1
@entity5 ’s head coach wound up with blood on his back			1
it belonged to @entity9 , whose selfless commitment embodied the gutsy nature of this vital victory			0
in saving face , the home players were left with damage there too			0
orders to use their heads clearly had been taken quite literally but the winners at @entity20 had also understood the message from their coaches to play smarter			1
the upshot was that a @entity25 series of stalled progress at least ended with a positive result against one of the mighty @entity30 teams			0
all the cuts , bruises and assorted wounds spoke of fervent , gallant endeavour but relief was still visible on battered @entity37 features			0
@entity9 ( right ) was brilliant and was bloodied and led off the @entity20 pitch by physio @entity41 ( left ) @entity1 ( right ) bears the blood of @entity9 on his tracksuit after the match at @entity20 @entity45 gives out a cry after barrelling over the line to score @entity5 's first try of the match on saturday @entity5 players celebrate @entity45 's second try at @entity20 during the november international on saturday @entity5 : @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity9 ( @entity55 62min ) , @entity56 , may ; @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 71 ) ; @entity60 ( @entity61 55 ) , @entity62 ( @entity63 72 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 61 ) ; @entity66 , @entity67 ( @entity68 55 , @entity69 79 ) ; @entity70 ( @entity71 78 ) , @entity72 , @entity45			1

referee : @entity97 ( @entity98 )			0
they knew this was a triumph for the here and now , to ease the pressure and dilute the torrent of recent criticism , without providing solutions to long - term conundrums			2
at the heart of this resilient performance based on forward force was the captain , @entity72			2
on several occasions , the @entity113 flanker made the sort of breakdown interventions which have often been considered beyond his scope , to dig his side out of deep holes			2
his work over the ball against the @entity73 was magnificent			1
yet , for all his satisfaction about personal and collective deeds , the skipper was realistic in his post-match reflections			0
‘ over the last two weeks we ’ve probably simplified things a bit and it showed with the way we played , ’ he said			0
‘ it still was n’t as smooth as we ’d like but it was smooth enough today			0
‘ we ’re extremely pleased with our forward play			2
you look back at the history of @entity37 rugby and they have always had a good pack to go back to			1
but it ’s about having more than that			0
captain @entity72 ( centre ) celebrates victory with props @entity64 ( left ) and @entity65 @entity5 head coach @entity1 looks on during the international at @entity20 on saturday 93.9 % - @entity5 won 93.9 per cent of their line - outs			1
18 - @entity5 only made 18 off - loads in their four tests			1
in their match against @entity5 alone , @entity147 made 15 off - loads			1
64 - tackles made by @entity72 this autumn , the most for an @entity5 player			1
91.3 % - @entity5 ’s average tackle success rate			1
their lowest figure was 86 per cent against @entity73			1
225 - metres run by @entity53 , the most by any @entity5 player			1
2 - @entity5 only lost two of 27 scrums on their own feed			1
‘ we know we ’ve stuttered throughout the series			0
we know it ’s not all smelling of roses and there are improvements to be made , but there ’s a huge amount of relief to finish like that			0
we feel like we ’ve got back to where we need to be but it is about going up another gear			0
’ a recurring question in the aftermath of this game was whether @entity5 have taken a step in the right direction this autumn			1
while coaches and players were keen to hint at marginal gains , the truth is that the team have not advanced - they are more or less where they were , with a wider base			2
the positive news is that they have identified yet more players who can stay afloat in the choppy waters of @entity184			0
@entity57 has been the principal ‘ find ’ - in confirming his ability to run the show at @entity190 - but others in that category are @entity54 and @entity68			2
@entity1 will take comfort from the expansion of the talent pool but sheer weight of numbers will not suffice			1
the urgent priorities now are to achieve selection stability , especially behind the scrum , and rediscover the attacking spark which characterised @entity5 ’s play during the last @entity201			2
@entity45 breaks an attempted @entity202 tackle to surge towards the line before the first of his tries @entity5 's scrum was dominant and @entity73 simply did not know how to deal with it on saturday @entity57 kicks a penalty against @entity73 at @entity20 during the november international on saturday @entity209 and @entity5 blindside @entity70 feeds @entity58 after a clean take at lineout time 31 - metres gained by no 8 @entity45 against @entity73			1
only @entity53 ( 58 ) and @entity54 ( 36 ) gained more ground for @entity5			2
it is quite understandable for the head coach to urge his players to come to his aid by performing well game after game at international and club level			0
that is the hallmark of the leading @entity147 , for instance , and a feat of consistency which @entity37 squad members continue to find elusive			0
the likes of @entity55 , @entity228 and @entity229 have dropped back in november and the coaches crave a spirited response			0
what is in no doubt is the towering scale of @entity5 ’s clout up front			2
as showcased in the scrum - led demolition of the @entity73 pack , @entity237 has assembled and honed a formidable group of imposing forwards			1
@entity45 ’s two tries were just reward for his fine carrying , while @entity67 was a colossal influence , particularly in defence and @entity60 had his best game of the autumn			0
@entity249 with girlfriend @entity250 watching @entity5 against @entity73 at @entity20 @entity251 ( left ) has established himself as one of the most exciting no 10s in @entity5 right now @entity55 ( right ) has been out of form and low on fitness and is now a no 12 option for @entity5 @entity237 conceded that he is facing a ‘ good headache ’ in the weeks ahead			1
several casualties will be pushing for a recall , notably props @entity261 and @entity262 , locks @entity263 and @entity264 , plus @entity265 and the fit - but - misfiring @entity229 in the back row			2
they all have a mammoth task to gatecrash a dominant unit			0
@entity5 could just about field two packs to compete with the best in the world			2
but the back line continues to frustrate and puzzle the coaches and outside observers alike			0
the selection wheel keeps turning , with midfield the perennial focal point			0
@entity58 and @entity251 should continue their half - back alliance in @entity279 - providing they stay fit - but @entity281 will surely storm back into the centre equation and @entity283 should be in the mix too			2
a case could be made for those two being unleashed together , with @entity283 at 12 and @entity281 outside him			0
@entity56 was told he could take a short - term grip on the inside centre position if he shone against @entity73 but he was unable to seize his chance			1
with @entity289 also tried and discarded , @entity249 will come into the reckoning , based on his ‘ barn - storming ’ potential to break tackles and off - load			0
@entity5 head coach @entity1 ( right ) congratulates @entity67 on a job well done @entity74 ( left ) of @entity73 attempts to evade the tackle of @entity5 's @entity57 at @entity20 on saturday @entity5 ’s wide attacking was made to look hesitant and wooden in comparison with the far more fluent @entity73 , who will come back to @entity20 on @entity302 business next year armed with a multitude of threats			1
however , the ghosts of their scrum nightmares have been resurrected and that could be a major benefit to @entity309 10 months from now			0
that is a deadly weapon but they need to develop more			0
the @entity5 scrum was dominant on saturday and epitomised the formidable @entity314 pack @entity45 was extremely impressive and is a very dangerous ball carrier for @entity5 @entity1 ( second right ) celebrates with coaches ( from left ) @entity318 , @entity237 and @entity319 after @entity5 beat @entity73 to win the @entity320			1

@entity5 beat @entity73 26 - *17* at @entity20 on saturday
@entity1 's men still have a lot to ponder ahead of @entity302
@entity5 's forward pack are good enough to dominate anyone
but their backs lack craft and guile and are a worry before @entity302
@entity1 's side definitely need to develop in order to win *tournament*
