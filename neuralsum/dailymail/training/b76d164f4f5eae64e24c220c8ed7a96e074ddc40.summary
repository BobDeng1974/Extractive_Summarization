published : 12:29 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 03:05 est , 30 august 2012 a new reconstruction has given researchers new clues as to how the moon may have formed			1
it is believed to have formed from a collision , 4.5 billion years ago , between @entity6 and an impactor the size of @entity9 , known as ' @entity10 '			1
however , over the past decades scientists have simulated this process and hit major problems known as the ' lunar paradox ' - finding the moon appears to be made up of material that would not be expected if the current collision theory is correct			1
researchers have shed new light on the collision which they believed caused the moon 4.5 billion years ago , when a massive collider known as ' @entity10 ' collided with the earth			1
a recent study published in the journal @entity26 proposes a new perspective on the theory in answer to the paradox			0
if current theories are to be believed , analyses of the various simulations of the @entity6 - @entity10 collision predict that the @entity35 is mostly made up of material from @entity10			1
however , studying materials from both @entity6 and the @entity35 , shows remarkable similarities			0
in fact , elements found on the @entity35 show identical isotopic properties to those found on @entity6			0
given it is very unlikely that both @entity10 and @entity6 had identical compositions , scientists say this paradox casts doubt over the dominant theory for the @entity35 formation			1
a group of researchers from the @entity52 , @entity53 , have now made a significant breakthrough in the story of the formation of the @entity35 , suggesting an answer to this @entity58			2
they used simulations to examine different geometry of collisions			0
they also examined the so - called ' hit - and - run collisions ' , where a significant amount of material is lost into space on orbits unbound to the @entity6			2
the researchers believe their simulation could finally solve the ' lunar paradox ' which has baffled scientists ' our model considers new impact parameters , which were never tested before , ' said lead author @entity76			2
' besides the implications for the @entity79 itself , the considerably higher impact velocity opens up new possibilities for the origin of the impactor and therefore also for models of terrestrial planet formation , ' while none of the simulations presented in their research provides a perfect match for the constraints from the actual @entity92 - system , several do come close , ' adds @entity93 , one of the @entity26 ' editors			0
' this work , therefore , suggests that a future exhaustive exploration of the vast collisional parameter space may finally lead to the long - searched solution of the lunar paradox			0

@entity102 researchers believe a ' hit and run ' collision far more violent than *previously* thought could explain how the moon came into existence
@entity107 could prove that a collision with an impactor the size of mars known as ' @entity10 ' formed the moon
