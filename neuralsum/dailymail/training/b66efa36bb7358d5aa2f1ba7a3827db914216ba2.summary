moving hologram displays like those featured in @entity2 could soon be available to watch on a laptop			1
scientists at the @entity5 have cracked a major technological hurdle to make low - cost , high quality holographic videos a reality			0
until now , the video hologram has generally been confined to science fiction , the most famous example being the projected image of princess @entity15 in the first @entity2 film			1
unlike a @entity19 image , a holographic projection allows the viewer to move around and get different perspectives from all angles scientists have cracked a major technological hurdle to make low - cost , high quality holographic videos a reality			1
this hologram was made by @entity29 existing systems that project moving holographic images are costly and suffer from severe limitations			1
the chief problem lies with devices called spatial light modulators , which direct light to form points in three dimensional space			0
with current technology , key elements of display size , viewing angle , frame rate and depth of image are restricted			2
the @entity47 engineers have developed a new kind of spatial light modulator that overcomes most of these problems			0
the research , published in the journal nature , promises to take the holographic video out of the realms of science fiction and into the real world			2
scientists estimate that a holographic monitor using the technology could be built for less than £ 320 ( $ 500usd ) , excluding light sources			1
the team , led by dr @entity62 , wrote in nature : ' we are now exploring displays based on arrays of these devices such as a small pc - driven , holographic video monitor and large - scale displays exceeding half a metre in width driven by dedicated hardware			0
' it is now possible ... to make holographic video monitors with full - colour , standard video resolution and a @entity77 ( hertz ) refresh rate			0
' unlike a @entity19 image , a holographic projection allows the viewer to move around and get different perspectives from all angles .			0

until now , the video hologram has generally been confined to films
but new technology means they could soon be watched on laptops
@entity2 ' princess @entity15 projection could be built for less than £ 320
