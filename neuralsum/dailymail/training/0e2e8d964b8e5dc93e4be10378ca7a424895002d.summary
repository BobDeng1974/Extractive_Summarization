@entity0 has asked to start @entity2 ’s first game in charge of @entity4 at the @entity6 @entity5 on tuesday night			1
the @entity8 striker is in @entity9 with his team - mates after returning to training following a disappointing @entity12 in @entity13			1
and new @entity4 assistant manager @entity14 has revealed that the 28 - year - old is raring to go ahead of thursday 's game against @entity17 in @entity18			1
actually all of the @entity12 lads have come back looking really sharp			0
' the @entity12 boys are a bit behind in terms of their fitness , with the other lads who have been back 10 days or so , but no , @entity0 looks good , along with the rest of the lads			1
' @entity0 really wants to play			1
' @entity34 has said he will assess all of his new players on this two - week tour of the @entity9 before making decisions on players ’ future			0
he has also not indicated yet who will be captain			0
@entity14 said : ' the players are trying to impress in training and they 'll be trying to impress in the game against @entity17			1
' that 's definitely the case when a new manager comes in			2
you want to be on that team - sheet for that first game of the season against @entity51 , so you do everything you can to do that			2
' it always matters who the captain is			0
it 's a tremendous honour			2
not many people get to captain @entity4 , so whoever it will be , it will be a tremendous honour			1
let 's get physical : @entity63 and team - mate @entity64 do some stretches during training on monday ' it 's one of the things we discussed first when i met @entity2			1
obviously , with the leaving of the experienced players , it 's one of the decisions we are prioritising			2
' the decision has n't been made yet			0
@entity77 is still getting to know the players			0
he 's still trying to see their qualities			0
' like i said , about the likes of @entity64 , @entity84 and @entity85 , maybe a player like that will thrive from it , take charge and come out of their shell			0
