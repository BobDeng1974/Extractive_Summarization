' sources at @entity17 believe @entity0 made his own situation much worse with his misjudged and half - hearted on - air apology on february 4			1

something missing ? the banner graphic for @entity20 was wiped of @entity127 ' name starting wednesday @entity0 , 55 , has so far declined to comment on his suspension			1

replacement anchor @entity90 opened the report by saying : ' and now to the story many of you are talking about tonight and one that for us not only hits close to home but in our home			0
' @entity90 quoted from statements from @entity53 and @entity51 , in which they described @entity0 ' actions as ' wrong and completely inappropriate , ' and which jeopardized ' the trust millions of @entity158 place in @entity17			2
' @entity90 then added : ' now if i may on a personal note say it is an enormously difficult story to report			0
' @entity0 is a member of our family , but so are you , our viewers and we will work every night to be worthy of your trust			2
' currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in @entity6 , a number of @entity0 ' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny @entity171 , @entity172 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity0 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			2
however in a 2005 @entity179 interview , @entity0 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			2
in the same @entity179 interview @entity0 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity185 trees in the sleepy @entity172 town in which he grew up			2
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ' stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity194 , 2003 over the years @entity0 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity194 in 2003			2

@entity226 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity228 , @entity0 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity226			0
