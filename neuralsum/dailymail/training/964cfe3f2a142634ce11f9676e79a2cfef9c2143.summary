by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 19:45 est , 16 may 2013 the @entity1 was forced to broadcast another grovelling apology for @entity3 yesterday after a flawed report on @entity5			1
the programme , which accused the military charity of misspending its cash , was made by the same journalist and group of researchers responsible for @entity3 ’s disastrous ‘ investigation ’ three months later which falsely accused @entity13 of being a paedophile			2
that slur cost the @entity1 £ 185,000 in damages to the peer and almost brought down the corporation ’s flagship tv news programme			0
the @entity1 has been forced to apologise for the @entity3 programme , presented by @entity21 ( pictured ) the @entity1 's editorial complaints unit said the report , by @entity24 ( pictured ) , was ' misleading ' and ' unfair ' last night @entity5 accused the reporter responsible for the @entity3 attack on the charity , @entity24 , and the @entity28 – with whom he worked – of ‘ shoddy journalism ’			1
mr @entity24 resigned as chief reporter of the now - discredited @entity28 after the @entity33 scandal last november implicating the former @entity35 treasurer in child abuse claims			0
the @entity1 has now admitted that mr @entity24 and the @entity28 ’s programme about @entity5 was ‘ misleading ’ and ‘ unfair ’ to the charity and the programme misrepresented the views of @entity40 , the mother of badly wounded soldier @entity41			1
the @entity3 report screened last august accused the charity – which was founded in 2007 and has raised more than £ 150million – of being ‘ too cosy ’ with the @entity46 and subsidising government rehabilitation buildings rather than spending on everyday care for veterans			1
@entity5 co-founder @entity47 was interviewed on the programme , broadcast on august 9 , 2012 mr @entity47 , who featured in a discussion after the report ( left ) , said he and his wife @entity51 are grateful the @entity1 has admitted it got the ' story completely wrong ' former @entity54 chief @entity53 led a barrage of criticism of the programme , saying the use of servicemen quoted in the report was ‘ a tragic abuse of them and a tragic abuse of the truth ’			1
he also raised fears that @entity3 may have ‘ seriously prejudiced ’ the charity ’s efforts to raise another £ 63million for the recovery centres vital to helping wounded service personnel			0
the charity ’s co-founder and chief executive , @entity47 , formally complained to the @entity1 , which insisted days after the broadcast : ‘ we stand by the programme and the high quality of our journalism			2
’ @entity5 reluctantly decided to take no further action at the time because it felt such a move would distract from its principal task of helping wounded servicemen			0
@entity5 was accused of misspending funds in the @entity3 report the @entity1 admitted it ' misrepresented ' the views of @entity86 , mother of wounded soldier @entity41 ( pictured together ) but when the @entity33 programme hit the headlines in november – when @entity3 was already under fire for dropping a report into disgraced dj @entity92 ’s years of sex crimes – the charity realised the same journalist and research team were involved , and asked the @entity1 to examine its complaint again			1
the corporation said yesterday : ‘ following an investigation by its @entity100 , the @entity1 now accepts that its coverage was misleading and unfair to @entity5			1
‘ the @entity1 gave the impression that @entity5 was responsible for shortcomings in the provision of support to wounded veterans			2
' the @entity100 found no evidence to support this suggestion			0
‘ although it was legitimate to report the concerns of veterans , the @entity1 portrayed criticisms about overall support by a number of agencies as specific criticisms of @entity5			1
' this unfair impression was reinforced by our coverage of the story in other outlets			0
‘ in addition , the @entity3 report contained interviews with two contributors which were edited in a way which misrepresented their views			2
’ mr @entity47 said : ‘ my issue has not been with the @entity1 , my issue has been with @entity24 and the @entity28 and what i feel was shoddy journalism			0
‘ the @entity3 report was a complete shock to us , but an even bigger shock to the men and women we ’re helping to recover			0
the @entity28 should now apologise			0
’ mr @entity24 said he stood by the story ‘ 100 per cent ’ and claimed the @entity1 investigation ‘ failed to fully and properly reflect the evidence put before it ’ .			2

@entity1 admitted the report on august 9 , 2012 , was ' unfair ' and ' misleading '
conceded views of contributors were ' misrepresented '
the charity had been accused of *wasting* millions of pounds , not supporting veterans or *providing* the best care
@entity5 *welcomed* apology and said it was grateful @entity1 has admitted it got the story ' completely wrong '
*newsnight* *heavily* criticised for *bungled* @entity13 report
