but there is a @entity8 family that can go not only one , but five better			0
and in the case of the @entity13 brothers , all nine lived to tell the tale			0
what 's more , one of the siblings also fought in the @entity18 , along with two older brothers			1
heroes : from left , ( top row ) @entity22 , who was the father of researcher @entity24 , then @entity25 and @entity26 , ( second row ) @entity22 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( third row ) @entity30 , @entity32 and @entity33 the record - breaking contribution by the @entity13 family of @entity36 to the battle against @entity38 had been largely forgotten			0
it was only rediscovered by 68 - year - old @entity40 as he researched his family tree			1
he knew that both his father @entity26 and an uncle @entity33 served in the war but a visit to the 90 - year - old @entity33 revealed the true scale of the family 's contribution			1
he discovered how @entity26 – 41 when he enlisted – signed up at the same time as @entity28 , 37 , @entity22 , 35 , @entity25 , 33 , @entity22 , 31 , @entity29 , 30 , @entity30 , 27 , @entity32 , 23 and @entity33 , 18			0
@entity26 and three brothers served in the @entity50 while four served in the @entity51 , with @entity30 serving in the @entity52			2
mr @entity40 made the discovery when he spotted a framed @entity55 ' certificate on the wall of his @entity33 's home			1
it acknowledged that @entity26 and eight younger brothers held the record for the most siblings to fight in the @entity4			1
special legacy : @entity40 with the @entity55 certificate that his father and eight brothers received for their war effort mr @entity40 said : ' it makes me intensely proud			1
the fact is , this record is never going to be beaten			0
big families are a thing of the past			0
' it 's a shame i never knew about the amazing story			2
my father and his brothers just grew apart over the years			0
inspiring : the award that 68 - year - old mr @entity40 spotted on the living room wall after he tracked down the last surviving brother , 90 - year - old @entity33 ' they never thought it was particularly exceptional that they had all fought in the war – they saw it as just doing their duty			1
' they also never knew about the award			0
it was @entity33 's son who notified @entity55 about the record			1
' he said he feared the worst as he delved into the family 's past and and into why his father and uncles had all drifted apart			2
' i was expecting to find some dark tale of murder or scandal but instead made this wonderful discovery , ' he said			0
' every time i think about it , it just hits me how much of an amazing story this really is			2
' he said he had not managed to find out all the details of the brothers ' war service , but added : ' i do know that @entity32 bumped into @entity33 while out in @entity114			2
' apparently @entity32 tapped him on the shoulder and said “ all right mate , remember me ? ”			0
' mr @entity40 's grandparents @entity117 and @entity118 had 13 sons and three daughters			1
the three eldest boys – @entity117 , @entity122 and @entity26 – fought in the @entity18			1
@entity122 was killed in action on may 17 , 1917 , during the @entity125 offensive in northern @entity126 and is buried there			1
his loss did not stop the younger boys joining up in 1939 to fight in the next global conflict			2
the @entity132 ' stellar war effort was not restricted to the men at the front			1
@entity117 and tenth child @entity135 could not enlist , and were involved in munitions production			1
another boy @entity137 , died aged just seven in 1922			2
@entity24 , lives with his wife @entity138 , 66 , in the village of @entity140 , @entity141			0
comrades in arms : brothers ( from left ) @entity28 , @entity22 , @entity25 , @entity146 , @entity29 and @entity147 before the family drifted apart super siblings : from left , ( back row ) @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity22 , @entity22 , ( front row ) @entity30 , @entity28 holding his sister @entity152 , @entity29 , and @entity147 holding sister may through the ages : from left , ( back row ) @entity28 , @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity22 , ( front row ) @entity147 , @entity117 and @entity29 an extract from the @entity158 from july 8 , 1944 , covering the tragedy of the @entity161 brothers @entity3 's 1998 epic @entity2 tells the story of a @entity4 mission in @entity164 to find paratrooper @entity165 ( played by @entity166 ) - the last surviving of four soldier brothers - and return him to his family			1
although a work of fiction , the story was based on the @entity174 policy , introduced by the @entity175 in 1942			0
it was brought in to prevent an entire generation of serving relatives being wiped out - a decision taken following the tragedy of the five @entity181 brothers			0
when the @entity184 was sunk in november , 1942 , in the @entity183 , it led to the deaths of the five boys from @entity187 , @entity188			0
when they signed up , brothers @entity117 , 27 , @entity191 , 26 , @entity192 24 , @entity193 , 23 , and @entity26 , 20 had insisted that they not be separated			1
tragically , following the torpedo attack , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 were instantly killed ; @entity26 drowned a day later ; while @entity117 lasted around four days on a life raft before disappearing			1
however , it is believed that @entity3 's main source of inspiration came from the case of the @entity161 family			0
of the four brothers , just two survived the war - but it was believed at the time that only one , @entity201 , had made it back alive			1
sergeant @entity207 ' @entity161 was a member of the @entity209 's @entity208			0
he was dropped into @entity164 on june 6 , 1944 , landed near @entity210 , and made his way back to the rest of his unit			0
@entity214 ( left ) who leads the mission to find @entity165 ( @entity166 , right ) in @entity3 's @entity2 his three siblings , however , were in other units : technical sergeant @entity219 with the @entity220 ( 505th @entity208 , @entity221 ) ; lieutenant @entity222 with the @entity224 ( 22nd @entity208 ) ; and technical sergeant @entity225 as a pilot in the @entity50 @entity227			2
in @entity164 , @entity219 was killed on @entity228 ; and @entity229 died near @entity231 beach			2
@entity137 , who had been shot down over @entity232 in may , 1944 , was missing presumed dead			0
in keeping with @entity174 , @entity161 was sent home to his family in @entity235			2
he would later learn that @entity137 had in fact spent a year in a @entity238 pow camp and was later rescued by the @entity8 .			0
