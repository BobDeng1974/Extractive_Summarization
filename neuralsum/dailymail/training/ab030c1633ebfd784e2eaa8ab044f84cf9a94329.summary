thought you ’d waved goodbye to spots in your teens ? think again			0
adult acne is on the rise , with one recent study revealing that more than a quarter of women in their 40s and 15 per cent of women in their 50s suffer from embarrassing and painful break - outs			1
acne is caused when an excess of the skin ’s natural oil ( sebum ) combines with dead skin cells to block the pores			1
these blocked pores can then become infected by bacteria that feeds on sebum			0
in just the same way that hormones wreak havoc on our skin during the teenage years so , too , are they the main culprit as we hit middle age			2
this is because testosterone triggers higher sebum production , and as we get older , we produce less oestrogen to balance our body ’s production of testosterone			0
increased stress caused by the pace of work and modern life , can all cause or aggravate acne			1
’ but there are also many other , lesser known , triggers that help unwelcome spots to appear			2
here , @entity59 unmasks the hidden skin saboteurs			2
@entity61 problem : your workout is great for your body , but could be terrible for your skin , especially on your back , chest and shoulders			2
this is because of ‘ @entity71 ’ or ‘ friction acne ’ as it ’s otherwise known , which occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin			1
the irritation increases sebum production in pores , which leads to whiteheads , blackheads and pimples			0
‘ @entity71 ’ or ‘ friction acne ’ as it ’s otherwise known occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin			1
put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out so the helmet you ’ve worn while you ’re cycling ; your sports bra strap or even your tight gym top could all be making your skin break out			1
also watch out for your yoga mat. bacteria from the floor , feet and sweat can accumulate and transfer to your face			2
in a 2012 study from the @entity98 , gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne , boils and folliculitis			2
@entity102 is an infection of the hair follicles which causes a nasty acne - like attack of red spots			1
in a 2012 study from the @entity98 , gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne , boils and folliculitis solution : first , put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out			0
wipe down equipment before use			0
ensure your gym kit is clean and made of breathable ‘ wickable ’ materials that hold moisture away from your body such as @entity125 ’s @entity124 or @entity126			1
if you prefer natural fabrics , look for bamboo and cotton mixes which do the same			0
make sure nothing ’s too tight so sweat does n’t get trapped and the skin is n’t irritated			1
have several sports bras of different styles and use a different one each time so you do n’t get rubbing in the same place			0
afterwards , always shower to remove sweat and bacteria , and put on clean clothes			0
if your acne is painful , see your gp			0
if it is itchy , ask for anti-fungal treatments and use an anti-dandruff shampoo as a body wash in the shower			0
@entity148 acne caused by oily shampoos , conditioners and styling products is so common , it has its own name : ‘ pomade acne ’ problem : acne caused by oily shampoos , conditioners and styling products is so common , it has its own name : ‘ pomade acne ’			1
cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity157 says : ‘ as they are rinsed out in the shower , oily , rich shampoos and conditioners drip over the forehead , shoulders and back , causing acne			1
‘ they can also cause folliculitis , the itchy , acne - like outbreak of spots , on the upper back			1
’ @entity170 hair - styling products can do the same as they tend to transfer from the hair to the skin , especially around the hairline , blocking pores and irritating skin			1
this is even more likely if you have a fringe , perhaps cut to cover spots in the first place			0
solution : wash and condition your hair at the beginning of your shower and rinse immediately			0
then tie your hair up and wash your face and body to remove any oil left behind			0
‘ i encourage patients who are breaking out in new areas , like the forehead or temples , to double - check their haircare products for oily and pore - clogging ingredients like coconut oil , and eliminate them , ’ says cosmetic surgeon dr @entity190			1
avoid hair oils completely if you are acne - prone			1
try a light , oil - free shampoo such as @entity201 ( from £ 4.99 )			0
for the body , try @entity203 ( £ 8.95 )			0
@entity204 problem : the pressure to stay looking young means skincare creams can be too intensive , too rich or too unsuited to many women ’s skin			1
‘ women today are much more concerned about anti-ageing , ’ says dr @entity46			1
‘ however , often these creams are far too heavy for their skin type and end up blocking pores and causing acne			1
’ solution : if you have oily skin or acne , avoid putting anything with oil on your face , especially almond oil , apricot kernel oil and oleic acid — a fatty acid found in olive and grape seed oil			1
beware of heavy , pore - blocking — and , therefore , acne - causing — ingredients such as lanolin and cocoa butter particularly if they ’re one of the main ingredients			1
and beware of the moisturising agent @entity235 and @entity236 , which makes cosmetics feel creamy			0
try lotions which tackle both ageing and acne such as @entity241 by @entity242 ( £ 23 ) and @entity243 + by @entity244 ( £ 15.50 )			0
drinking @entity245 if you ave swapped full - fat milk for skimmed , you could be damaging your skin problem : if you eat a lot of bread and pasta and have swapped full - fat milk for skimmed , you could be damaging your skin			1
‘ as you hit your 40s and 50s , you can become insulin - resistant , which means your body is less able to metabolise sugar , ’ says dr @entity46			1
‘ starchy foods such as bread and pasta are broken down in the body so they are indistinguishable from liquid sugar			0
high blood sugar stimulates insulin which can worsen inflamed acne			0
’ milk may also be troublesome			0
while all types of milk are linked with increased acne , a 2007 study found skimmed is the worst			0
women who drank the equivalent of two or more glasses of skimmed milk per day were 22 per cent more likely to develop ordinary acne , and 44 per more likely to develop cystic acne , which causes painful , large and deep spots that do n’t come to a head			1
why ? nobody is sure , but it is likely to be because milk contains hormones which can cause an imbalance in human hormones			0
the key culprit may be insulin - like growth factor - 1 , or @entity287 , a natural hormone which seems to increase skin cell growth in the lining of the pores , which then become blocked			2
it ’s thought that processing milk by removing fat may remove the hormone oestrogen which is stored in fat and protects against the male hormones that cause acne			0
solution : stick to a low gi diet — which is rich in high - fibre foods which release sugar slowly into the blood stream , thereby keeping blood glucose levels steady			0
also switch to unsweetened almond milk which does not contain hormones			0
‘ i recommend cutting out sugar and all starchy , grain - based foods , including bread , pasta , and breakfast cereals			2
instead , eat unprocessed protein such as fish , meat and eggs , lots of vegetables and fruit in moderation , ’ says dr @entity46			0
the natural process of fermentation in yoghurt breaks down @entity287 , so full - fat yoghurt is less likely to trigger acne			2
washing your face too much when prone to break - outs , many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build - up			1
but this can make matters worse problem : when prone to break - outs , many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build - up			1
but this can make matters worse			0
cosmetic doctor @entity341 says the wrong cleansers will dry the skin , causing acne			2
this is because healthy skin is protected by the ‘ acid mantle ’ , a fine , slightly acidic film on the surface			1
acne - causing bacteria can not thrive in an acid environment , but if the skin surface is disrupted by excessive cleansing , the skin becomes alkaline , allowing the bacteria to flourish			1
this is a particular problem for older women because collagen loss makes their skin thinner , more fragile and naturally less acidic			2
‘ @entity362 soaps and harsh cleansers can easily disturb older skin ’s natural barrier , ’ explains dr @entity341			1
‘ frequent exfoliation either with abrasive scrubs or harsh acid peels are also damaging and make skin inflamed and sensitive			2
’ this means that the kind of acne treatments teenagers use to banish their blemishes may simply cause inflammation , redness and soreness in older women			1
solution : avoid soap and foaming cleansers containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate , ingredients that break down oil , but can also damage the skin barrier			2
instead , use a gentle wash off cleanser such as @entity387 ( £ 12 )			0
cosmetic dermatologist dr @entity157 recommends : ‘ wash your face no more than twice daily for about 40 to 60 seconds , which is enough time to ensure it is clean without stripping it			0
‘ cleanse at the end of your usual shower as the warmth and moisture will help soften dead skin cells so they exfoliate easily			2
