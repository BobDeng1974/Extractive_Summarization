by @entity0 i 've been given a deadline of september 6 to get back to @entity4 cover shape			1
back in december last year i got into my best shape ever and made the cover of the top fitness magazine , weighing in a 12st 8lbs and 8 per cent body fat			1
i am far from that now ( 13st 6lbs and 15 per cent body fat ) , and this week i was told i 've got a very revealing photo and video shoot at the beginning of next month that 's going to have nationwide exposure			1
if i 'm flabby and out of shape then it 's going to be on show for all to see			1
i 've got a four point game plan to reach the target 1			1
minimum five gym sessions per week , with top trainer @entity22 at @entity29			1
take three @entity30 every day to boost fat burning , add energy and stop snacking 3			2
eat clean and low carbs 4			1
no more booze and late nights			1
@entity36 is the killer for any weight - loss regime			2
i love a glass of red wine but it 's 250 calories – that 's 20 minutes running a swift pace on the treadmill			2
i have to remind myself of that every time i think about having a snifter			2
going that extra mile : @entity0 has only got until september to get back into shape dedication : @entity0 has been avoiding both alcohol and carbs in order to maintain his fitness if you have a large night out , not only have you put away 2,000 calories of booze you also set your body metabolism back a day – you ca n't work out on a hangover ( well , i would n't advise it )			1
your body is working hard to detox itself and you ca n't change your body shape in that state			1
first session back with @entity22 this week was pretty grim			1
he was especially hard on me because i 'd cancelled a session at the last minute earlier in the week – it was the day after my birthday , ca n't he give a guy a break ? anyway , he warned me it would be a punishing schedule , so i popped two @entity30 tablets just before i got changed			2
they take a couple of minutes to kick in and then i was fired up for a hard session			2
feeling the strain ? @entity0 says that his workout with @entity22 is no walk in the park practice makes perfect : @entity0 works up a sweat with a kettlebell one quick point before we start on the work out – there is no easy way of doing this			1
some very rare people enjoy going to the gym , i 'm not one of them but i do enjoy the results - being fitter , healthier , and looking good naked			2
if you want to see a difference you have to work hard for 50 minutes in the gym , a few times a week and really push yourself			0
ok , rant over , now carry on			0
@entity99 we started with something @entity22 calls @entity99 – circuit training type exercises that work big muscle groups in top and lower body and burn a lot of calories and get the blood pumping			0
you can see from the look on my face in the pictures that it 's not entirely fun			0
@entity0 says he was in his best shape in december last year , however he has since gained almost a stone then it 's 10 squats , 10 flat bench presses , 10 x prone dumb bell rows , 10 x kettle bell swings			1
only rest for the time it takes you to walk from one exercise to the next , then take one minute rest at the end of each full set of four			0
we did 10 of these sets – and i was shattered			0
but it was n't over – punishment for cancelling the day after my birthday came next			0
metabolic conditioning metabolic conditioning is the fancy name for rolling a big 80kg tire six times and then pushing it back			1
thirty seconds rest , then do it again , and again			0
@entity22 made me do it five times and i thought i was going to be sick			0
then it was time for the battle ropes			0
five reps of that and i was finished			0
i work it out that i 've got another 15 of these torture sessions to go before i 'm ready			0
they wo n't get any easier but hopefully i wo n't feel quite so nauseous at the end of them as time goes by			0
lots of love , @entity153			0

@entity0 has less than a month to get in shape
back in december he was his fittest but has gained a stone since then
he has given up booze and is avoiding carbs in order to *transform* himself
