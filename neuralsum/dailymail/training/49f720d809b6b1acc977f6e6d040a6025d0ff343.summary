the bizarre episode is the basis for new movie compliance , starring @entity42 , which opened yesterday			2

on the officer 's instructions , @entity24 called ms @entity2 into the office , took her car keys and phone and locked the door			1

another manager and two employees saw the abuse happening but did nothing as they believed it was being conducted on police orders			0
it was only when 58 - year - old maintenance worker @entity95 refused to take over the abuse and demanded an area manager be contacted the episode ended			0
helpless : ms @entity2 can be seen wiping her eyes as @entity24 continues to take orders from over the phone trapped : @entity24 also took ms @entity2 's car keys and mobile phone so she had no way escaping or calling for help @entity24 claimed the caller sounded so convincing she was happy to do whatever he said			1

father - of - five @entity164 was accused of being being the series of calls but was acquitted in 2006 of impersonating a police officer , solicitation to commit sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment because of lack of evidence			2
