by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 12:53 est , 15 january 2014 it 's the butt of jokes and widely misunderstood , and yet , erectile dysfunction causes embarrassment and distress to more than two million @entity8 men			1
with creams and injections not always proving effective , more and more men are taking the plunge and turning to surgery to cure their bodily woes			1
but as @entity15 , a 45 - year - old lorry driver from @entity16 , found out , surgery is n't without its risks			1
after having a penis pump , a common surgical solution for men with erectile dysfunction , inserted , he was left with a permanent erection			1
upsetting : @entity15 , 45 , was left in agony when a penile pump operation was botched ' it 's very embarrassing to walk around with an erection that wo n't go away , not to mention painful , ' he reveals			1
' imagine trying to stuff an erection into your pants and hide it all the time			2
i was wearing baggy clothes and over-length shirts to try to hide it			0
' his problems began in 2006 when he began suffering from erectile problems and the catastrophic loss of confidence that resulted			2
' i could see it was taking a toll on him because , you know , not feeling like a man , ' @entity15 's wife @entity40 explains			1
' he was in despair			0
' recluse : @entity15 says being left with a permanent erection left him depressed and too upset to go out recluse : @entity15 says being left with a permanent erection left him depressed and too upset to go out after a succession of creams and pills failed to provide a cure , @entity15 and @entity40 decided to spend their $ 42,000 life savings on surgery			1
' most men with erection problems have an inability to get or maintain an erection satisfactorarily to have sexual intercourse , ' explains @entity62 , a consultant urologist			1
' [ a penile pump ] has two little balloons which are implanted into the penis , a small pump which lies in from of the scrotum and a bag of saline which lies next to the bladder			1
' when the patient wants to have an erection , he simply squeezes the pump , and the cylinders fill up with saline and become swollen and also quite rigid			2
' @entity15 hoped that the pump would prove the solution to his woes			1
instead , the operation was the start of a year of misery			0
after an operation that should have taken one hour turned into four , @entity15 was forced to stay in hospital for an extra four days and returned home in agony			1
' the pain every day was like something stabbing me , ' he remembers			0
' it was like a screwdriver poking at the inside of the scrotum , trying to break free			0
and it did n't go away - it did n't get easier			2
' solution : properly inserted ( as shown ) , a penile pump can permanently cure erectile dysfunction doctors told him the pain was caused by swelling , and told him it would go as the swelling went down			1
they were right , but no - one told him what to do about the erection that remained			2
' i thought it was normal , ' he confesses			0
' i thought , if that 's the way they left me , then maybe that 's how i was supposed to heal			2
i thought when i went to the doctor , they would show me how to use it			0
' he returned to his surgeon for advice , and left black and blue after the medic tried - and failed - to get the pump to work before telling him it was defective and another $ 10,000 operation was needed to remove it			1
@entity123 , @entity15 sought a second opinion and was horrified to discover that not only had the original surgeon botched the operation , ' it looked like they did n't know what they were doing			2
' ' i decided to go and get another opinion , and he basically told me that the first surgery was botched and whoever did it , did n't know what they were doing			0
' upsetting : erectile dysfunction makes the lives of 2.3 million @entity8 and 30 million @entity139 men a misery possible solution : some men turn to @entity143 but pills and creams do n't always work for everyone but unable to afford an operation to remove the pump , @entity15 was forced to live with the erection for eight months , putting huge strain on family relationships and turning him into a virtual recluse			1
' my son was embarrassed by me , ' he says			0
' he did n't come around me for months			0
i was the guy with the erection - he did n't want to be around me			2
' worse was to come			0
the surgeon had bungled the original operation so badly , the tubing connected to the penile pump moved , eventually scissoring through his skin while @entity15 was enjoying a family holiday			1
' by the time we got to the hotel room , the rip in my scrotum had gone from top to bottom and all the tubing was hanging out , ' he remembers , adding : ' i was scared to death			0
' rushed to hospital , @entity15 endured three operations to repair the damage and remove the pump but was left with what resembled an empty sack of skin			1
desperate to be ' normal ' again , he underwent one last operation , this time under the auspices of a respectable surgeon and had a new penile pump fitted , ' i.			1
really , i did n't feel like a man at all , ' he remembers			0
' how could you ? so we decided that the only way i was going to be normal was to get back what i 'd lost			0
' following his fifth operation , @entity15 was left with a fully - functioning penis , albeit one that is half the size of the original			1
he 's sanguine about the loss of length			0
' after all we 've been through , i 'm grateful to have what i do have , ' he adds			0
' at least i can make love to my wife , which is the main thing			0
' i would just urge anybody to use caution before having any surgery			0
you might just get more than you bargained for			0
' @entity15 appears on @entity205 , tomorrow night at 10pm on @entity206			2
