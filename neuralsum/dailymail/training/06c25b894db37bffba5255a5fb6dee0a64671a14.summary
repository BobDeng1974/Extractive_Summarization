by @entity0 soccer clubs have been banned from using associating themselves with nations , religions of political organisations to ensure the sport remains popular			1
the new regulations , outlined in the @entity9 's @entity8 , state that club 's names and logos can not ' carry any ethnic , national , political , racial or religious connotations either in isolation or combination			1
' this means no references are allowed in : ' words or letters in @entity21 , and / or references to the broader geographic area in which the club is located ; and / or colours ; and / or references to flora ; and / or references to fauna '			0
' football is now a part of the mainstream of @entity43 society and has achieved that status while also retaining its rich diversity , ' mr @entity35 said			0
' the intent of the @entity8 is to ensure the game remains inclusive and accessible , not just in the way we organise ourselves , but in how we engage with the community			1
@entity53 's @entity52 - based @entity51 ( left ) and @entity54 , formally known as @entity53 ( right ) are two teams which have a strong history of migration amongst their players ' the very name and logo of a club sends a message about what that club stands for			0
we want clubs that stand for uniting people through the joy of football			0
' however the policy was greeted with criticism across social media , with tweeters suggesting that the new rule is ironically avoiding multiculturalism by banning national association			2
' @entity31 want to be " inclusive " by banning anything with ethnic connotations ? that 's not inclusivity , that 's xenophobia , ' @entity78 tweeted			1
' unbelievable stuff from @entity31			2
ethnic clubs in this country represent so much more than just a football team , ' another tweeter , @entity83 , wrote			0
concerns have been raised for teams with strong histories of migration , such as @entity53 's @entity52 - based @entity51 who mostly have @entity93 heritage , as well as @entity54 who were formally known as @entity53 @entity53			0
despite reassurance from @entity31 that the policy will only affect new clubs and not the names and logos of long - standing members , any revisions made by current clubs are expected to be subject to the new rules .			1

@entity31 has released its @entity8
club names and logos ca n't carry ' ethnic , national , political , or religious connotations '
@entity31 says the policy promotes football as inclusive and multicultural sport
some soccer fans are angry at the new rules and claim they are racist
