by @entity0 last updated at 10:53 am on 2nd march 2012 a toddler born with a rare form of dwarfism has been fitted with titanium ribs to stop her body from suffocating her			2
@entity6 , two , has @entity7 , which has stopped her rib cage from developing properly and puts pressure on her lungs			1
the youngster underwent two gruelling seven - hour operations at @entity14 in @entity15 to increase the size of her chest			1
she was then transferred to @entity18 in @entity19			2
@entity6 who her mother @entity20 described as ' unstoppable ' during the operation a titanium bar was fitted vertically down the middle of both halves of @entity6 's rib cage to pry the ribs apart in both directions			1
surgeons have performed the pioneering surgery on around 200 children in the @entity31 her mother @entity20 , 27 , said : ' the chest expansion was very traumatic because it was a life or death operation			1
' she could have died in surgery			0
as she gets older , she faces further surgery			1
her life expectancy is unpredictable			0
' we live every day like it could be our last			1
she ’s just plodded on and fought			0
' @entity6 has astonished doctors with her strength and resilience			1
' ms @entity6 , from @entity43 in @entity44 , said her daughter was diagnosed with @entity46 in january 2010 , when she was two months old			1
her older half - sister @entity47 , 9 , is not affected			0
the genetic condition , which affects around one in 130,000 children , puts @entity6 at risk from developing life - threatening respiratory infections and possible kidney failure			1
@entity6 is still attached to a ventilator to assist her breathing			1
' she needs ventilation wherever she goes because her lungs are under - sized , but developmentally she 's bright as a button , ' said @entity20			0
@entity6 has a form of dwarfism , which stops her rib cage from developing properly ms @entity6 currently makes a three - hour round trip by bus every day to visit @entity6 at @entity18			1
' she has been to hell and back and she ’s got through it , ' the mother - of - two said			2
' she is a little fighter			0
it ’s a dream come true having @entity6			1
doctors are surprised she has made it this far but i ’ve always had faith in her			0
' nurses say @entity6 is a different baby when i walk in the door			1

ms @entity6 recently moved to a bungalow to make it easier to care for her daughter and @entity6 should be home shortly after @entity86			1

' she is learning to walk and doing brilliantly			0
' i am really proud of her			0
it ’s the best feeling in the world to have her in your life			0
' @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity14 , said : ' this surgery involves expanding the chest wall to provide space for the lungs to grow			2
this can be done in infancy , or whenever the lungs start to struggle for space			0
' worldwide experience in this surgery is very limited			0
traditionally this procedure was carried out , at intervals , on both sides of the chest			2
however , having built up experience and expertise at @entity14 we can now do a single procedure called ‘ bilateral surgery ’ in which we expand both sides of the ribs and fix them with a metal plate			2
the child then needs further surgery as they grow			0
' this type of surgery has only been carried out at @entity14 in the @entity126			0
it has been shown to offer very good clinical results in the short - term , it reduces the time the child has to spend in intensive care , and leads to faster recovery			0
nevertheless , it is of course a major surgical procedure			0

we live each day like it could be our last , says mother
@entity6 faces regular operations in the future to expand her chest as she grows
