video : scroll down to see @entity5 arrive in @entity11 ahead of the @entity9 clash @entity6 wonder : @entity5 is back home for @entity10 's super cup clash against @entity3 prepared : @entity3 coach @entity2 is only too aware of @entity5 after his brace against them last season @entity5 shone for @entity10 against @entity3 last season , which is an experience etched in @entity2 's memory , and he is expected to play a pivotal role as the @entity7 giants target more silverware			1
' we unfortunately got to know him in the first match he played ( against @entity3 ) , and he was already at an extremely high level , ' said @entity2 , during monday 's pre-match press conference in @entity11			1
' it was a beautiful game for spectators , but an ugly game for @entity3			2
' talking tactics : @entity2 addresses his squad during training on tuesday afternoon that fixture came in october , when @entity5 scored twice in a 7 - 3 win for @entity10 at the @entity46			1
' when you have a player of that calibre on your side , you can rest easy			0
we will aim to cover him individually , and also his team - mates tomorrow , ' @entity2 said			1
' it has n't surprised me how quickly he has adapted ( with @entity10 ) , based on the fact he 's a great player and a great athlete			2
final preparations : @entity59 ( centre ) battles for possession in training ' he has adapted quickly , and it 's down to his character and personality			0
his style and his team match , and that has been key to his success			0
' while @entity2 readily showered praise on 25 - year - old @entity5 , he was less forthcoming when asked about speculation linking defender @entity72 with a possible move to @entity74			1
' i expect him to play for us tomorrow , ' said @entity2 , without offering any further comment			2
real are expected to parade new signings @entity80 and @entity81 - both are included in a 23 - man squad - but @entity2 claims his team will be ready for whatever is thrown at them			2
helping hand : @entity3 players take part in an unusual routine in the build up to the game ' we have tried to think about the initial line - up they may have , but we have prepared regardless of who will play , ' he added			1
' the handicap that might play in favour - or against us - is that @entity81 and @entity80 have not yet played with @entity10 , but we can not prepare just for them			2
we have to see what their entire line - up will be			0
' they are football players of the highest level , players of the highest rank in physical and technical terms			0
they know how to give their best			0
head boy : former @entity109 frontman @entity108 shows off his ball skills ' you can spend more time defending than attacking , but you have to have a balance , ' you have to be ready defensively			0
we have to base our defence on a tight formation and face off one - on - one with their players so they do n't have numerical superiority , but if we have possession we need to have speed to go forward			0
' the strategies are important			0
they have important players - @entity81 is a great playmaker - but we have our tools and weapons			0
' they are the favourites , but we have a lot of passion and we are convinced we can compete and take this spirit to overcome obstacles on the pitch			0
' possession play : @entity3 players do a keep - ball exercise in training @entity136 focused on the game despite being ' back home '			1
