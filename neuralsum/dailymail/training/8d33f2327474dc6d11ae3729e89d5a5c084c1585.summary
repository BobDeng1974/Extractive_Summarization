by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 6 december 2012 updated : 07:59 est , 6 december 2012 poisoned : @entity1 , 36 , was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work a chef was killed by deadly fumes from a disposable barbecue lit in ' mysterious ' circumstances inside his flat			1
@entity1 , 36 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , was found dead by his worried boss after he failed to show for work at the @entity13 , @entity11 , @entity14 , an inquest heard			0
police found the burnt - out grill on a coffee table in his apartment shortly after midday on may 31			0
although @entity21 and @entity14 coroner @entity20 said the barbecue was given as the cause of death by a pathologist - mystery surrounds exactly why it was there			1
he recorded a open verdict at @entity29 on november 29th			1
he said there was no explanation for the barbecue ’s presence and explained there was insufficient evidence to conclude mr @entity1 placed the grill indoors deliberately to kill himself , or that he had been cooking on it inside oblivious to its danger			1
it follows several deaths caused by the devices nationwide this year , including one at @entity44 in march			0
inspector @entity45 - the first officer on scene at @entity47 , off @entity10 , @entity11 - said mr @entity1 ’s death followed national publicity about a child who had died after falling asleep near a disposable barbecue while camping in @entity52			1
inspector @entity45 told mr @entity20 that there ‘ did n’t seem to be any reason ’ for the barbecue to be in the flat because it appeared no food had been cooked on it and he found the remains of a @entity62 meal nearby			1
the inquest heard from mr @entity1 ’s @entity64 , dr @entity65 , who said his patient had suffered from the ‘ unpleasant ’ bowel condition @entity68 since he was 30 , had undergone ‘ big surgery ’ because of it and was taking quite a lot of medication			2
he said that in the months before his death , mr @entity1 said he was ‘ feeling down ’ and waking up during the night so he was prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressant drug mirtazapine			2
but dr @entity65 told the hearing mr @entity1 gave no indication he wanted to take his own life			0
@entity81 , mr @entity1 ’s manager at the @entity13 , where he had worked since september 2005 , said he was sent home poorly on the evening of saturday , may 26 and was off work sick the day after			0
failed attempts were made to contact him during the week but when he could still not be reached by thursday , she visited his flat where she found him dead			0
mr @entity20 suggested mr @entity1 might have brought it inside to keep warm - something he described as a ‘ bad idea ’ - or to cook , although there was no remnants of food			2
and he ruled out any third party involvement			0
' i am well short of the necessary certainty that @entity1 did this perhaps with the intention of killing himself , ' said mr @entity20			2
' he was feeling low but there ’s no indication he was suicidal			1
' it could be that he was doing something really not advisable with the barbecue because they are , as we have learned , potentially lethal in an enclosed space			0

coroner @entity20 recorded open verdict and said he did not know why barbecue was in the flat
@entity1 ' was feeling low but there ’s no indication he was suicidal ' , said coroner
