by @entity0 last updated at 9:49 pm on 19th december 2011 he has been mocked for making a $ 10,000 bet on national tv			1
but now @entity4 has been forced on the defensive again over his wealth after a picture emerged of him and his hedge fund colleagues being showered in money			0
the picture - which @entity16 have likened to @entity17 in the 1987 film ‘ @entity19 ' - shows the @entity11 presidential candidate grinning from ear to ear and holding up a $ 20 note			1
it was taken whilst he worked at hedge fund @entity22 in the 1980s and has been seized on as another sign he is too rich to relate to normal people			1
too rich ? @entity26 , a liberal group , has used this 1980s photograph of @entity4 ( center ) and his @entity22 colleagues to compare him to ' @entity19 ' movie villain @entity17 today it also emerged that the former @entity32 governor is still making millions of dollars a year from @entity33 , even though he retired 13 years ago			1
the @entity34 reported that he negotiated a retirement deal which has flowered into assets worth up to $ 70.9 million , earning him and his wife $ 13.4 million between them			1
@entity4 is one of the wealthiest candidates ever to run for president and has a family fortune estimated at up to $ 250 million			1
but his finances became a campaign issue when he tried to make a $ 10,000 bet with fellow presidential candidate @entity46 during the second to last tv debate			1
critics have also claimed that whilst at @entity33 , @entity4 oversaw layoffs and rampant cost cutting at the companies he took over			2
the picture of him from the 1980s was published on the left - leaning @entity55 website and shows the 64 - year - old with six colleagues looking very pleased with themselves indeed			0
can he relate ? mr @entity4 's wealth has become an issue because critics say he ca n't relate to average , middle and working - class voters does @entity4 's wealth make him out of touch with ordinary @entity63 ? whilst @entity4 and a colleague hold one $ 20 between them , one of his friends is smoking a cigar whilst another has money in his mouth			1
the man to the far left also has two $ 20 notes stuffed down either side of his shirt collar			0
a doctored version has the caption : ‘ greed is good ! @entity79 ’ above the photo			0
the @entity34 reported that under the deal he negotiated with @entity33 , @entity4 still gets a cut from the profits of deals done even after he left			0
in his 2011 disclosure , he said he had assets in the company between $ 12.4 million and $ 60.9 million which has given him between $ 1.5 million and $ 9.3 million in income			1
he has also set up a $ 10 million trust for his wife which has brought in $ 4.1 million			2
@entity4 also has other investments including an additional $ 100 million fund for his five sons			2
bad odds : the $ 10,000 bet mr @entity4 ( right ) made with @entity97 gov @entity46 ( left ) was one of mr @entity4 's first gaffes his total net worth could be much higher , the @entity34 reported , as he is only required to provide minimum estimates held by his wife			2
the developments came as @entity4 remained second in the polls to become the @entity11 presidential nominee , although @entity106 ’s campaign appears to be imploding			1
a survey by @entity108 in @entity109 , the first state to choose its candidate , found that @entity112 was in the lead on 23 per cent , @entity4 was on 20 per cent and @entity114 was on 14 per cent			1
in an interview @entity4 said that the ‘ @entity17 ’ picture was taken at the closing of @entity33 ’s first fund and that they were just celebrating			0
he said : ‘ we went out as a group of folks , said , you know , i wonder if we can raise money from other people to organise a company , we can get capital from others that will allow us to begin a business that will be successful			0
‘ and we went out and raised money			0
we were successful in raising our first fund ; it was about $ 37 million , an extraordinarily large amount of money that we raised from other people			2
‘ and we posed for a picture , just celebrating the fact that we 'd raised a lot of money and then we hoped to be able to return it with a good return ’			0
@entity143 , a spokeswoman for @entity4 , denied there was anything untoward in his retirement deal with @entity33			0
she said : ‘ this was a typical market deal			0
@entity22 has no incentive to overpay governor @entity4 , and they did n’t			0

critics say he 's too rich to relate to middle - class voters
his fortune is estimated at $ 250 million , making him one of the richest men ever to run for president
@entity11 presidential nomination is still in flux as @entity112 places first in recent @entity109 poll
