by @entity0 a couple who were told their premature baby boy would die if he underwent surgery after being born with four life - threatening heart defects , today hailed their ' miracle ' son after he proved doctors wrong to survive			1
@entity10 , was born three months early with his main arteries in the wrong place , a large hole in his heart , a narrowing valve , and unconnected blood vessels			1
his parents @entity18 and @entity19 , from @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , were told there was no hope for their tiny son			1
doctors , who had never encountered this combination of deadly defects before , advised the couple to let 2lb 6oz @entity10 die naturally as he was too small to survive surgery			1
fighter : @entity10 in hospital recovering from his 15 - and - a - half hour surgery to re-wire his heart ( left ) and today with his mother @entity18 but mrs @entity36 said ' gut instinct ' told her that @entity10 was a ' fighter ' and she refused to give up on her son			1
now , after spending weeks on a ventilator and just 10 months after a marathon 15 - and - a - half hours in theatre to re-wire his heart , @entity10 is like any healthy 18 - month - old , who loves playing with his twin brother @entity44			1
@entity18 and @entity19 with their twin boys			2
it was the first day that @entity10 ( right ) and @entity44 had been brought together at nine weeks old mrs @entity36 , 33 , said : ' he ’s a miracle			1
they said he was too small and would not survive to be big enough to have the surgery			1
they basically said they could n’t possibly fix his heart and we were advised to let him go			2
' as a parent , to be faced with that decision was the worst thing			2
but we felt it would be an injustice not to give him the opportunity to fight for himself			2
' if there was ever someone on the brink of this world and the next , that was @entity10			1
he did n’t seem to be here nor there			0
' now , sometimes i will look at him and cry without realising it			0
i ’m so proud of how strong he ’s been			0
even one of the cardiologists refers to him as ‘ miracle boy ’			0
' staff at @entity78 ’s @entity77 , where he was treated , consulted with surgeons as far a field as @entity81 before going ahead with the risky operation when he was just eight months old			2
the surgery was even carefully scheduled to coincide with when his 32 - year - old dad was home from his private security work in @entity87			1
the family ’s nightmare began just four days after @entity10 and his brother were born 12 weeks premature in @entity91			1
scans detected anomalies with his heart and he was taken to @entity77 , where he was diagnosed with four major defects			1
together they left @entity10 with an insufficient circulation that put excess pressure on his heart and lungs , which would have eventually resulted in heart failure			1
luckily he developed a small obstruction in his heart , which helped restrict the amount of blood that was flooding into his lungs			2
@entity10 on a heart and lung bypass machine immediately after his surgery			1
he recovered well and no longer needs medication mrs @entity36 , who has three other children , said : ' he was on and off a ventilator for eight weeks and somehow managed to gain enough strength at 16 weeks to come home for a while			1
' there were periods when he would turn blue			0
he set his apnoea monitor off about a dozen times a night because his breathing was so shallow			0
' it was just a case of keeping him stable at home until he was big enough for the surgery			1
but even at that point there were no guarantees they would be able to do a complete repair			0
' @entity10 was so weak that his mother had to wait three weeks before she got to hold him for the first time , while he was still on a ventilator			1
at eight months old , however , his condition started to deteriorate			2
he was so poorly he could barely suckle a bottle			0
but as he was nearing the target weight of 13lbs , which he had to be to endure the risky operation , surgeons decided to proceed before he became too weak			0
full of beans : @entity10 ( right ) now loves to play with his twin brother @entity44 mrs @entity36 said : ' he went in [ to surgery ] at 9am and it was n’t until half past midnight that we got him back to the intensive care unit			1
' even after the surgery , we were told it was difficult to see anyway out of the situation for him			1
at that point they had done everything they could for him			0
but to come that far and be faced with the prospect of burying your baby was devastating			0
' i felt guilty because if this was to be the end , it would be a terrible way to die			0
but i ’m glad we took the risk			0
it ’s been worth the gamble			0
' @entity10 had to be hooked up to a heart and lung bypass machine to keep him alive during the @entity163 only came off it two days later when his heart was able to cope with the changes			1
@entity10 was born with transposition of the great arteries , which meant the vessels taking blood away from the heart to the lungs and the body were plumbed in the wrong way around			1
he also had double outlet right ventricle , which meant there were no blood vessels connected to the heart ’s main pumping chamber to the body			2
his third defect was ventricle septal defect , which left a large hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles			0
and he had mitral valve stenosis , a narrowing of the valve , restricting the flow of blood and causing a lethal build up of pressure behind it			0
he also remained on a ventilator for a further six weeks , until he was eventually able to go home			0
he had to take up to 12 medicines a day			0
but despite being on and off a ventilator for 14 weeks in total during six months in hospital , @entity10 is now off all medication			1
@entity10 may need further surgery in his teens to replace a synthetic valve , which he will eventually grow out of			1
but mrs @entity36 said : ' we were told if he survived the operation , the world was his			2
' he came off all his medicines two weeks ago and now he ’s just a normal little boy who loves playing with his brother , rolling around the floor and playing with cars			0
' he ’s such a happy boy and always got a smile			0
i ’m so proud of him , i ’m just bursting with pride			0
i always knew he was a fighter and the staff at @entity77 were amazing			2
' consultant cardiac surgeon @entity218 , who performed @entity10 ‘ s operation , said : ' he had quite a complex cardio anatomy that is very rare in public literature			1
' the surgical process was quite a long process because of the combination of defects that had to be dealt with			2
' we certainly pushed the envelope			0
he had a complex combination of conditions , he was premature , and if you put it all down on paper there were a lot of risk factors to cause some anxiety and increase the operative risk			0
' there are a lot of uncertainties and unknowns in rare conditions but we are delighted with his recovery			0
he now has a heart that works like a normal heart			2
' his exercise tolerance should be pretty close to normal and i ca n’t see any reason why he should not have a good outlook			0

@entity10 was born three months early with four major heart defects
his mother said her gut instinct told her he was a fighter
@entity10 *battled* for eight months before he was big enough to have life - saving surgery . ten months later he no longer needs medication
