not content with spending $ 2bn on virtual reality company @entity1 this week , @entity0 has revealed that @entity3 's future is even more sci - fi			1
in a post he revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			1
he has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to ' the next 3 billion people ' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time			1
@entity0 said that drones , satellites and laser are being used in @entity3 's labs to beam the internet to underdeveloped countries ' for suburban areas in limited geographical regions , we ’ve been working on solar - powered high altitude , long endurance aircraft that can stay aloft for months , be quickly deployed and deliver reliable internet connections			1
' for lower density areas , low - earth orbit and geosynchronous satellites can beam internet access to the ground			1
' for all of these systems , the team is looking at free - space optical communication , or @entity40 , is a way of using light to transmit data through space using invisible , infrared laser beams			1
' source : @entity47 ' in our effort to connect the whole world with @entity47 , we 've been working on ways to beam internet to people from the sky , ' he wrote			2
' today , we 're sharing some details of the work @entity3 's @entity57 is doing to build drones , satellites and lasers to deliver the internet to everyone			1
' our goal with @entity47 is to make affordable access to basic internet services available to every person in the world			2
' ' we 've made good progress so far			0
' over the past year , our work in the @entity70 and @entity71 alone has doubled the number of people using mobile data with the operators we 've partnered with , helping 3 million new people access the internet			2
' however , he admitted that new technology was the key to expanding the internet 's reach			2
' we 're going to continue building these partnerships , but connecting the whole world will require inventing new technology too			0
' that 's what our @entity57 focuses on , and there 's a lot more exciting work to do here			0
' our team has many of the world 's leading experts in aerospace and communications technology , including from @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity97			1
' the @entity98 ( @entity99 ) @entity99 ( @entity99 ) that flew for 54 hours			0
@entity3 today revealed it has hired key staff from the project			1
power : @entity105 's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity - it flies above the clouds , so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours			1
wingspan and payload : 60 metres wide			0
the @entity112 carries a payload of 250 pounds			0
speed : cruising speed for the @entity112 is about 65 mph			0
function : the drone can be used for surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication , which is what @entity3 is said to be interested in			1
distance : the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles			0
' today we are also bringing on key members of the team from @entity130 , a small @entity131 - based company whose founders created early versions of @entity98 , which became the world ’s longest flying solar - powered unmanned aircraft , ' he said			2
' they will join our team working on connectivity aircraft			0
' @entity3 is also tipped to spend up to $ 60million on buying @entity139 - based @entity105 , which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land , in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who do n’t have it			1
however , the technical challenges are still great			0
the @entity148 's deputy president , professor @entity147 , said : ' the idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low - orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles			2
' in april , @entity156 also acquired @entity105 , which is building solar - powered drones ( pictured ) to provide similar connectivity @entity3 has a checkered history with privacy , and many have voiced concerns about how the site could use drones to collect data about people			1
in theory , the drones could be used to take aerial images , or collect details about wireless networks and individuals			0
as @entity3 's drones will be used to provide internet to people home 's , there will need to be a limited amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network			1
with this in mind , they are likely to be subject to strict regulation			0
in the @entity189 , for example , the @entity187 's ( @entity187 ) guidelines state private operators are allowed to fly their drones ‘ recreationally ’ and commercial drones are ' prohibited			0
' however , earlier this month judge @entity193 , from the @entity194 ( @entity194 ) dismissed a fine , which the @entity187 had placed on a drone photographer			0
@entity197 said @entity199 ’s camera drone was ‘ not subject to [ federal regulation ] and enforcement , ’ and therefore the fine was n’t @entity201 is unsure exactly what this ruling will mean for companies such as @entity205 , and now @entity3 , but it could see the restrictions relaxed			1
@entity3 is also planning to use these drones in areas outside the @entity189 , and it will depend on the individual country 's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance			1
' the difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost			0
as technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and @entity3 's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area			2
' he warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved			2
' top of the list is the need to make the drones cost - effective , reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace			0
' many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum , national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed , ' he added .			0
