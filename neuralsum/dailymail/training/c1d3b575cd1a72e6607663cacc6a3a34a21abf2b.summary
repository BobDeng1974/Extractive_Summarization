' the residents are saying enough is enough and have started a 24 - hour watch			1
hopefully it will be enough to deter these people			0

signs erected nearby say : ' flood defences			0
do not remove sandbags ' , right praise : speaking at a national press conference prime minister @entity51 this week hailed the wall of sandbags as vital in protecting residents from the floodwaters the community of @entity160 in @entity161 has been battling with rising flood waters ever since sunday night			1
but after having to wait for sand bags to be delivered , some woke up the following day to find they had been stolen - and being sold to their neighbours			1
to compound the misery , thieves have also targeted properties vacated by reluctant homeowners as the stagnant water creeps over the threshold			1
resident @entity172 said : ' it 's outrageous and disgusting			0
the people here are suffering enough			0

mother - of - one @entity210 , 29 , who has lived in the community all her life , described the looting as ' disgusting '			0
' grief capitalists ' : people living in @entity160 , @entity161 , pictured , have hit out at ' gried capitalists ' , who have been charging over the odds for stolen sandbags , targeting vulnerable people she said : ' how can you look at someone who is going through heartbreak and steal from them ? ' how can you make money out of someone else who is suffering ? it 's terrible			1
' much of the sand has been donated by the khalsa aid @entity231 community group in nearby @entity233			0

shocked : @entity267 said it is ' disgraceful ' that his local council is trying to charge residents for sandbags to protect their homes working out it would take 500 bags to protect their homes , the group faced a bill of £ 3,750			1
the conservative council 's policy goes against government orders that local authorities should not be charging residents for sandbags			1
and it flies in the face of prime minister @entity51 's repeated statements that ' money is no object ' when it comes to local council 's dealing with floods			1
@entity267 , 61 , a retired undertaker , said : ' we have been requesting sandbags from the council to protect the building after our block was flooded downstairs last time			2
' our local councillor said that the council had no sandbags available and no money for the sandbags			2
' she said they have @entity302 available for £ 7.50 each but considering we need at least 500 , that is an awful lot of money			0
' i was absolutely shocked			0
' we all pay council tax and surely there is a duty of care from the council that they have to provide us with			0
affected : @entity313 is among the residents angry at @entity262 in @entity257			2
the council said sandbags are available for emergencies and for residents whose homes are at risk of imminent flooding ' we 've tried repeatedly over the past seven weeks to get some help , we 're in a desperate position now and we need the most basic help			1
' @entity326 , whose dad @entity327 was evacuated from his ground floor last month , said : ' you switch on the tv and the prime minister is saying things like money is no object but clearly it is			0
' @entity336 mp , minister for local government , today said : ' there is no reason whatsoever for a council to charge for sandbags			2
' yet on its website , @entity262 council state that in times of flooding they do offer the free provision of sandbags to residential properties			2
@entity349 , strategic director at the council , said : ' we do have sandbags available for appropriate use when an emergency is called and these will be made available			2
' it is neither reasonable nor practicable to provide an unlimited supply of sandbags to properties which have not been identified as at risk of imminent flooding			2
