a white teacher in @entity1 has come under investigation after telling a black student to say ' yes , sir , master '			0
the incident happened as teacher @entity6 was telling his class of students to go downstairs in @entity10 in order to take their economics final in the middle of last month			1
when student @entity15 said ' yes , sir , ' the @entity16 reports that @entity6 replied ' you meant to say " yes , sir , master			2
' who the f * * * are you talking to ? you 're nobody 's master , and this is not the slave days , ' @entity15 said			0

@entity56 heard back from principal @entity57 who confirmed that their investigation proved that the incident had happened			0
scene : officials from @entity10 in @entity16 ( pictured ) have confirmed that the ' shameful ' incident did take place but could not reveal how - and if - the teacher would be punished ' the instructor was very remorseful , ' mr @entity57 said according to ms @entity56 , and he described the incident as ' terrible ' and ' shameful '			1
that said , the principal was unable elaborate about what , if any , punishments the teacher is facing because district rules mandate that disciplinary actions against teachers are kept confidential			1

@entity15 , 17 , spoke back at the teacher after @entity6 made the comment and told his mother later
school district rules mandate that teacher disciplinary actions are kept private so *administrators* could not say if @entity6 is being punished
