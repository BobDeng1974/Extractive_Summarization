by @entity0 like a child in a sweet shop , my eyes goggled at the array of inviting colours			0
should i go for pillar box red , tangerine orange or deep plum ? as i tested each shade out in front of the shop mirror , pouting and stretching my mouth into one teeth - baring smile after another , i noticed the assistant giving me strange looks			1
but i did n’t care			0
she was n’t to know what a momentous occasion this was			0
for the best part of 20 years , i had worn lipstick on only a handful of occasions			0
smiling again : @entity0 aged nine ( left ) , and now , after 15 months of wearing braces smiling and wearing lipstick , you see , would only draw attention to the part of my face that i hated : my teeth			1
with a crooked front pair that jutted forward and overlapped and big gaping holes at the sides , i preferred to keep my mouth shut			1
but now , at 43 , after wearing fixed train - track braces for 15 long months , i finally have a smile to flaunt			1
at a cost of £ 4500 , my overbite has been hoiked back , my front teeth uncrossed and straightened , and four gaping holes , where teeth were misguidedly taken out as a teenager , closed			1
the results are not perfect			0
according to my specialist orthodontist , dr @entity47 at @entity48 in @entity49 , only corrective jaw surgery — breaking , moving and rewiring the supporting bones — could give me a full - on @entity54 smile			1
beaming : @entity0 after having her braces removed and feeling much happier but i am not complaining			2
as well as buying three new lipsticks , i have been flashing my new smile at every opportunity as i lay to rest the ghosts of a protruding set of gnashers that has tarnished some of my happiest moments			2
my primary school nicknames included @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ( after the puppets in the cartoon @entity67 ) and at 13 , my teeth were awful enough to earn me free treatment on the @entity72			1
i had train - track braces for two years , wisdom teeth removed , an overnight head brace , more teeth out and even surgery to remove my frenulum , the string of tissue under my top lip			1
frankly , i think my orthodontist was at his wits ’ end because even he could n’t understand why , by the age of 16 , my teeth did n’t look remarkably different from when the treatment began			1
not a vain person , i learned to live with my less - than - perfect teeth and perfected a small , tight smile for the camera			1
before : not a vain person , i learned to live with my less - than - perfect teeth and perfected a small , tight smile for the camera			1
after : i now have a thin wire fixed behind my teeth to keep them in place and a set of clear retainers which look like gum shields to wear every night for the rest of my life			1
it 's a small price to pay for a perfect smile			2
it was there in the pictures of my 30th birthday party which i co-hosted in a cool basement bar in @entity49 with my very attractive friend , @entity106			2
we were both tipsy and while she wrapped an arm around me and beamed , i looked stiff and po - faced , as if i could n’t wait to leave			2
concerns about my looks inevitably had an impact on my confidence when it came to the opposite sex			0
and , i could n’t help but wonder whether my snaggle teeth were the reason i was still single when so many of my friends were being snapped up			2
but at 31 i met @entity119 , who thought my buck teeth quirky and cute			2
nonetheless , that same tight smile was there on the happiest day of my life — our wedding day in december 2005			1
the photographer kept saying , ‘ give us a nice , big smile please , @entity0 ’ and , ‘ bit bigger ? ’ then , ‘ more happy ? ’ i was happy			0
i just did n’t want to show my teeth			0
tight - lipped : until @entity0 got her teeth fixed , she hated showing her teeth in photos			1
' even now , i look back at those pictures and do n’t see the beautiful antique dress or the lovely husband beside me			1
instead , i hone in on the big front tooth resting on my lower lip			0

it bothered me so much that when i became the editor of @entity144 magazine at 37 and had to have my picture taken for the editor ’s letter page , i insisted my teeth were digitally retouched to give me a beautiful , even smile			1
i was particularly self - conscious when i had to meet new advertising clients or give presentations to large groups of people			0
by the time my 40th birthday came round , i was starting to feel the dissatisfaction more acutely			0
the overlap of my two front teeth seemed to be getting worse and there was now a dark yellow staining between them where my toothbrush could no longer reach			1
i started to do my research			0
during treatment : i opted for the more subtle porcelain white variety of train track			1
the treatment was arduous ; my teeth were often tender and my mouth full of ulcers and grazes where the tracks rubbed against my gums			2
according to the @entity173 , adults were now making up half of the patients in some practices and enquiries for adult braces were up 135 per cent since 2011			0
after discussing it with @entity119 and my family , who understood the extent of my unhappiness , i decided to have a consultation			0
dr @entity47 explained she could improve my smile dramatically by fixing metal braces to the front of my upper and lower teeth for up to 18 months			1
i would have to visit her every four to six weeks to have them tightened — with thicker wires and elastic bands — and i would experience some discomfort along the way			0

the treatment was arduous — my teeth were often tender and my mouth full of ulcers and grazes where the tracks rubbed against my gums			2
i could n’t bite into hard foods and my cleaning routine — with interdental brushes and mouthwash and rigorous brushing — kept me in the bathroom for a good half hour each night			0
friends only noticed the braces when i pointed them out , and were very curious , some even contemplating work themselves			0
