by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 could look back on a battle well fought throughout sunday : ‘ it looks like i ’m finally growing up now , ’ concluded the 34 - year - old @entity5			1
it sounded like even he would agree that the process had taken some time			0
but this was one of his major near - misses from which he could genuinely take pride , certainly more than was the case when he was in contention at this same course eight years ago			0
it was on that sunbaked afternoon at @entity17 that he came out dressed from head to toe like a canary and subsided woefully as @entity22 romped to the title			1
afterwards the @entity24 is said to have texted to a friend that ‘ i just bludgeoned @entity26 ’			1
his closing 66 ensured this was never a procession as fortune favoured the brave , and he rode the odd decent bounce to make life uncomfortable for @entity31 playing in the pair behind			1
‘ i wanted to make him feel it a little bit and see how he would respond , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ every time i got closer he kept making one more birdie			0
‘ it ’s not easy when you know you ca n’t make any mistakes , there are so many things that need to go right for you to shoot at least eight or nine under			0
but at least i ’m proud of the way i played and i ’m happy			2
’ hand on heart : @entity2 was proud with how he played and happy with his performance video the open championship : final round he also admitted that he had the odd lucky break , such as when his ball rebounded off the grandstand on the 12th and fractionally missed the bunker on the 13th			1
it was a far cry from some of the self - pitying inquests he has conducted after coming close in the @entity70 , when either the world seemed to have been against him or he had declared that he was simply not good enough , as happened at the @entity72			0
@entity2 is from the @entity74 school of sporting bridesmaids and this was the 19th time he has finished in the top ten in what is already his 63rd appearance at one of the big four championships			2
in golf , specifically , he belongs to the same bracket as @entity84 and @entity85 , particularly as all three have contrastingly excelled under the steamhammer pressure the @entity87 brings			0
unlike the latter for sure and , you now suspect , the former , he still has a chance of breaking his duck when it comes to the pursuit of the highest individual honours			0
up and over : @entity2 plays from a bunker on the 17th green in @entity98 on sunday @entity2 emerged with far more credit than his playing partner @entity101 , who not only failed to mount a charge in shooting level par but spat his way round this corner of the @entity106 , just as he had done on the putting green			1
the @entity5 signalled his intention with two birdies in the first three holes , and then allowed himself a glance at the scoreboard on the eighth as @entity31 wobbled behind him			1
a 12 - foot putt helped him eagle the tenth and his challenge only expired when went into the bunker on the 15th , and his first attempt to get out hit the wall and rebounded back in			0
his problem going forward is that , having been denied by @entity22 in his pomp , he now has to confront another outstanding rival in @entity31			1
but it may be time to start loving @entity2 , even at those times when he is not wrapped in @entity126 ’s @entity87 flag .			2

@entity2 pushed eventual @entity29 winner @entity31 close on sunday
after getting the better of @entity2 in 2006 , @entity22 is said to have texted a friend saying : ' i just bludgeoned @entity26 '
this year , @entity5 was proud and happy with the way he performed at @entity17 having *subisded* eight years *previously*
