the first signs of dark matter interacting with a force other than gravity may have been found			1
until now it was thought that dark matter did not interact with anything other than gravity , earning it its ‘ dark ’ moniker and making its detection incredibly difficult			1
but the discovery of a ‘ clump ’ lagging behind a galaxy suggests that it may not be as oblivious to our universe as we thought			1
@entity18 scientists studied a ' clump ' of dark matter that appears to be lagging behind its galaxy - suggesting it interacts with itself			1
in this @entity25 image , the lagging clump can be seen on the left of the central cluster			0
the distribution of dark matter in the cluster is shown with blue contour lines dark matter is confusing because it interacts with nothing - including itself			1
this is despite seeming to account for 85 per cent of the universe ’s mass and having an observable effect on galaxies : without dark matter , our galaxies would ‘ fall apart ’ as they spin			1
aside from gravity , though , dark matter seemed to just pass through the universe without interacting with any other mass , such as humans , planets or stars			1
now an international team of researchers at @entity18 has found a clump offset from a galaxy by 5,000 light - years , suggesting that is not the case			1
when physicists study the dynamics of galaxies and the movement of stars , they are confronted with a mystery			0
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces			0
from this they deduced there must be an invisible kind of matter that does not interact with light but does , as a whole , interact by means of the gravitational force			0
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up 85 per cent of the matter in the known universe			1
when it comes to the total energy in the universe , though , it 's a different story			0
astronomers have found that the total mass / energy content of the universe is split in the proportions 68 per cent dark energy , 27 per cent dark matter and 5 per cent ' normal ' matter			1
dark energy is an unknown force across the whole cosmos that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the universe			0
so the 85 per cent figure above relates only to the fraction of ' matter ' that is dark			0
the discovery was made around one of the galaxies in the @entity107 cluster , 1.3 billion light - years away			0
here , four galaxies are colliding around the centre of the cluster			0
the team used the @entity112 ’s ( @entity112 ) @entity111 ( @entity111 ) in @entity113 , along with images from @entity25 , to view @entity115 3827			0
the offset is important because it is only possible if dark matter interacts with itself through forces other than gravity			2
if the particles collide with each other , the friction from the collisions would cause the dark matter to slow down , and fall behind the galaxy			1
the nature of that interaction is unknown ; it could be caused by well - known effects or some unknown force			0
all that can be said at this point is that it is not gravity			0
but dark matter has never before been observed interacting in any way other than through the force of gravity - making the discovery of huge interest			2
‘ we used to think that dark matter just sits around , minding its own business , except for its gravitational pull , ’ dr @entity140 from @entity18 said			1
‘ but if dark matter were being slowed down during this collision , it could be the first evidence for rich physics in the dark sector - the hidden universe all around us			1
’ he added to @entity153 : ' this is the first time we 've caught dark matter in the act of doing something interesting			2
' once the dark universe around us is allowed to interact at all , the possibilities for what it could get up to are rich and varied			0
' this image from the @entity164 / @entity163 shows a zoomed out view of the galaxy cluster @entity115 , 1.3 billion light - years away			0
the strange blue structures surrounding the central galaxies are gravitationally lensed views of a much more distant galaxy behind the cluster although dark matter can not be seen , the team could deduce its location using a technique called gravitational lensing			2
the collision happened to take place directly in front of a much more distant , unrelated source			0
the mass of dark matter around the colliding galaxies severely distorted space - time , deviating the path of light rays coming from the distant background galaxy - and distorting its image into characteristic arc shapes			1
our current understanding is that all galaxies exist inside clumps of dark matter , which is how they are able to survive without flinging themselves apart			2
the team used the @entity112 ’s ( @entity112 ) @entity111 ( @entity111 ) in @entity113 , pictured , along with images from the @entity163 , to make the discovery ' we know that dark matter exists because of the way that it interacts gravitationally , helping to shape the universe , but we still know embarrassingly little about what dark matter actually is , ' said team member dr @entity206 of the @entity207			2
' our observation suggests that dark matter might interact with forces other than gravity , meaning we could rule out some key theories about what dark matter might be			1
' the researchers note that more investigation will be needed into other effects that could also produce a lag			0
similar observations of more galaxies , and computer simulations of galaxy collisions will need to be made			0
this result follows on from recent findings from the team which observed 72 collisions between galaxy clusters and found that dark matter interacts very little with itself			1
this latest study follows research by the same team last month that found dark matter interacts with itself very little - but the fact that it interacts at all is very exciting , said dr @entity140			1
shown is the galaxy cluster @entity238 +2403 and its dark matter distribution , shown in blue , based on its gravitational interactions the new work , however , concerns the motion of individual galaxies , rather than clusters of galaxies			2
researchers said that the collision between these galaxies could have lasted longer than the collisions observed in the previous study - allowing the effects of even a tiny frictional force to build up over time and create a measurable lag			0
taken together , the two results bracket the behaviour of dark matter for the first time			2
dr @entity140 added : ' we are finally homing in on dark matter from above and below - squeezing our knowledge from two directions			2

@entity18 scientists studied a ' clump ' of dark matter
it was found to lag behind the galaxy it was associated with
this suggests dark matter particles can self - interact and slow down
it means dark matter may not be as oblivious to our universe as we thought
