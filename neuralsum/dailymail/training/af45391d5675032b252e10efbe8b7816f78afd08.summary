a four - year - old girl has become an ambassador for a new campaign - to help cure children like her who are robbed of the chance of growing up			2
@entity5 has @entity6 - a rare brain condition which affects only girls , slows down growth and reverses development			1
it most often strikes youngsters just after they have learned to walk and say a few words and starts dragging their progression backwards			1
over time they lose their new skills and are left unable to communicate or use their hands to hold , carry or manipulate objects			2
progressive condition : @entity5 appeared to be a happy , healthy baby ( left ) but her parents became concerned when her development went into reverse			1
she was diagnosed with @entity26 's syndrome although most reach adulthood they lose their motor control essentially locking them into their bodies			1
currently there is no cure for this cruel disease but @entity5 's mother @entity36 , 36 , has started a major fundraising campaign for research into the illness			1
she hopes a breakthrough will come in the next 10 years			2
it is believed that @entity26 ’s syndrome may possibly be the first reversible brain condition as symptoms have been successfully reserved in animals			1
presently @entity5 is not able to sit unaided , speak or walk			1
@entity45 , who runs a sandwich shop in @entity48 , said : ' it is basically a break - down of communication between her brain and her body			2
she also has no control over her hands - she ’s constantly wringing them			1
' there ’s some fantastic research going on , especially the work of professor @entity60 , who successfully reversed the syndrome in mice			2
we are hoping and praying every day they are one step closer to finding a cure			2
we ’re not giving up hope			0
' @entity5 pictured with her brother @entity68 and parents @entity69 and @entity45			1
@entity26 's only affects girls and is caused by a mutation of a gene in the x chromosome @entity45 , who also has a son called @entity68 , 7 , said the youngster was diagnosed just before her second birthday			1
@entity45 and @entity5 ’s dad , @entity79 , 37 , had alerted doctors after noticing slow development			1
' everything was normal during pregnancy , ' she said			0
' @entity68 was six - and - a - half weeks early , so we thought she may come along early too , so they had me on steroids to build me up and she was just two weeks early			0
' everything was perfectly normal until her first birthday , she was a bubbly , happy baby who would wriggle around			0
the only thing was that she was n’t sitting up on her own yet , but doctor said she would eventually catch up			0
' but a few months later @entity5 got a chest infection for a couple of weeks and during this time @entity5 deteriorated significantly			1
' she stopped doing everything she had done , so she would just lie there not moving			0
she was very placid ; relatives said she was too good			0
before she had been giggling and moving about			0
i thought she was maybe just weak , but i eventually took her to the gp , ' she said			0
@entity5 was referred to @entity99 where @entity5 ’s muscle tone and bloods were @entity103 mri scan was also carried out , which came back clear , but doctors wanted to see @entity5 again on receiving the results of her bloods			1

@entity5 will never talk or walk @entity5 , pictured at two years old , which was when she was diagnosed on april 17 , 2010 , @entity45 and @entity69 were told the reason for their daughter ’s slow development was @entity113 , which only affects young girls			1
she said : ' we had no idea what it meant , we had never heard of it			0
they said a cure for the disease would not be found during @entity5 ’s life			1
' of course we were devastated , it was our little girl			0
nothing can prepare you to hear that she will never be able to look after herself , talk or walk and that there was no hope of her getting better - it was very very difficult			1
' @entity5 was born a few weeks early so her parents did n't worry about her slow development @entity45 and @entity69 along with family and friends , have been trying to raise as much money to enable this research by @entity136 , to be continued			1
@entity45 has trained and completed charity runs , whilst @entity69 and friends took on a @entity140 peak challenge , raising £ 5,000			0
more recently , girls and boys gathered in @entity48 for a fun walk dressed as super heroes and princesses in a bid to raise money			2
@entity69 said : ' at times you just feel numb because this condition is like a bereavement			0
we lost our dream of having a healthy daughter and everything that goes with that - that one day i would walk her down the aisle , have grandchildren			2
' the first few months she would cry at least three hours a day , but now she is such a happy little soul			0
she loves being around her grandma , who is always singing			0
' her favourite song is @entity162 has it by @entity164 , she loves @entity165 too			0
we never go anywhere without music			0
one minute she ’ll be screaming and when we put on music , she ’ll be beaming			0
she really is one of the happiest girls you will ever meet			0
' sufferers of the illness - including @entity173 ’s adopted sister @entity172 - have small hands and feet and experience a ' deceleration ' of the rate of head growth			2
the illness was first described by @entity179 pediatrician @entity26 in 1966 and affects only girls as boys have different genes and male sufferers of the condition would rarely survive birth			1
