@entity0 took pole position for sunday 's @entity2 by a margin so small it was practically beyond comprehension			1
after 3.147 miles , the slender figure of @entity7 was all that split the @entity9 and @entity10 team - mate @entity8 in their latest , thrilling skirmish for the @entity13			1
the qualifying session was just as electrifying as the @entity16 setting			2
cars bumped along tight city streets illuminated by 1600 lamps , supported by 65 miles of electric cabling and 24 pairs of generators			2
the old colonial buildings stood out like white dinosaurs next to the skyscrapers that reached high into the black sky of this humid night			2
the top three from @entity29 qualifying salute the crowd as @entity0 takes pole for sunday 's race @entity0 secured his sixth pole of the year in @entity2 qualifying on saturday the ever - impressive @entity35 ( left _ will start ahead of @entity36 yet again after qualifying third @entity38 pips @entity8 to pole the usual fallers fell away but left a larger group than usual to fight for pole , with the @entity43 and @entity44 right on @entity10 ’ pace			1
@entity35 was momentarily fastest as time ran out			1
could @entity0 or @entity8 , still on their final laps , knock @entity51 ’s @entity50 off top spot ? @entity8 , clean and serene , did so by two - tenths of a second			1
then we saw @entity0 lock up his front left wheel at the first corner of his last lap. surely his challenge was over ? but no , he found glorious pace through the remaining 22 corners to win the day			1

@entity99 ( @entity100 ) @entity97 1:52.287 @entity0 ’s father @entity101 punched the air , smiled widely and high - fived in the @entity10 garage			1
@entity105 , who needs to retain the momentum he gained by winning the last race at @entity108 if he is to reduce his 22 - point deficit to @entity8 , said : ‘ 007 — @entity110 — that ’s cool ! it was the most exciting qualifying session i have had for a long time			1
i guess no one was expecting to see how close everyone was			0
there were a lot of people really in the mix and that is when you have to be so on it			0
‘ you have to be spot on and i was almost there			0
i locked up at the apex of @entity125			0
i was down two - tenths by the time i got to turn five			2
i thought it would be impossible to regain it but the previous lap there were a couple of corners where i lost out , so i sorted them out			0
’ @entity8 was told what @entity0 had done to him and yelled down the radio : ‘ damn it ! ’ for once , though , there was little sign of animosity between them as they shook hands			1
‘ seven - thousandths , when i think back to the lap , is nothing , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ a bit more here or there and i could have done it			0
@entity0 did a good job to get pole , so fair play			2
there is a long race ahead and second is fine			0
’ reigning world champion @entity36 will start in fourth having won the last three races in @entity29 @entity0 's team mate @entity8 replied ' damm it ' on radio after being informed of @entity0 's pole lap @entity0 's 0.007 second qualifying victory over @entity10 team mate @entity8 is also how much younger an astronaut is after 6 months in space than if they had stayed on earth			1
@entity0 ’s second successive pole and sixth of the season gives him a significant advantage in today ’s race on the slow , narrow circuit — the @entity174 ’s answer to @entity175 , both in its racing characteristics and its glitzy appeal			2
however , a safety car has been deployed at all six previous stagings of this grand prix and the likelihood of a similar interuption today offers unpredictability and hope to @entity0 ’s pursuers , who are led by @entity8 , @entity35 and his @entity51 team - mate @entity36 , and @entity65 ’s @entity64			1
@entity35 , who is third in the championship 72 points behind @entity8 , is at least in the best position to take advantage of any @entity10 slip - ups			1
with three wins to his name this season , @entity35 said : ‘ to end up being closer than we thought , it has been a good day			2
hopefully i can keep it up tomorrow and get a better view from the podium			0
coming into the weekend i thought that if we could be within two or three - tenths , it should give us a more optimistic chance in the race to stay with them , so , yeah , i think we ended up a bit closer than we thought we would			0
‘ the track was really improving so you had to adapt a lot during the session			0
street circuits normally tend to be like that , so it keeps you on your toes			0
‘ i think all us drivers enjoy them			2
you jump across kerbs , you brush near the wall ; the closer you get the more you want to risk and i guess that ’s why we race , we love that rush , that adrenaline			0
’ the @entity2 offers up spectacular views over the night sky as the street circuit hosts @entity13 doubts over how the tyres will last the gruelling corners and heat offer another potentially important factor in a remorseless race that tests every caliper , disc and pad of the brakes to near destruction point.another unknown is the new , part - ban on pit - to - car radio transmissions but both @entity8 and @entity0 dismissed that as a critical factor in their likely fortunes today			1
while @entity0 was celebrating , his fellow @entity9 @entity79 was 11th , losing out in qualifying for the third successive time to his rookie @entity75 team - mate @entity73 , who was ninth			1
@entity51 's @entity35 qualified third for the @entity2 behind the @entity10 duo once again the chasing pack will be behind a @entity10 one - two at the start of the @entity29 @entity2 it all looks civil after qualifying as @entity10 team - mates and title rivals @entity0 and @entity8 chat			1

@entity10 driver @entity0 sets the fastest time in @entity29
title rival @entity8 just seven thousandths of a second back
he *exclaimed* ' damm it ! ' over the team radio after hearing @entity0 's result
@entity51 drivers @entity35 and @entity36 third and fourth
@entity61 driver @entity79 fails to make @entity268 in 11th place
