the humble chopping board is integral to even the most basic of kitchen cupboards			0
from raw meat to organic root vegetables , most of what we eat will pass across its surface en route to pan or oven			1
now , a new survey has revealed the chopping board to be one of the most dangerous utensils , harbouring 200 per cent more faecal bacteria than the average toilet seat			2
the research , commissioned by the @entity18 , found 40 per cent of all food poisoning cases are caused by poor hygiene in the home			1
almost half of all frequently touched items in the home , including chopping boards , are contaminated with harmful bacteria including @entity27			1
dr @entity28 , food hygiene expert and @entity18 representative , said : ' in all surveys i have ever done focusing on the home , chopping boards come out really badly , the reason being because people do n't clean them properly			1
this infographic reveals the hidden dangers lurking on your chopping board			0
a survey revealed the average chopping board has around 200 per cent more faecal bacteria on it than the average toilet seat ' people pay lots of attention to the toilet , using lots of disinfectant and think that is the dirtiest place in the house			2
' but nearly every study i have been a part of , it is the kitchen where the most dangerous bacteria lurks			0
' raw meat , raw vegetables and poultry are the culprits			1
' people are n't aware that the organisms are invisible , and so people are n't taking the necessary precautions to protect themselves			0
' the first thing is to understand where your enemy is			0
' raw meat , vegetables and poultry harbour @entity27 , salmonella and campylobacter bacteria - more than 60 per cent of raw chicken contains campylobacter bacteria			1
the @entity18 advises using disinfectant wipes on kitchen surfaces ' basically if you have raw chicken in your home , you are likely to have @entity80 bacteria			1
' the best approach is to assume all raw meat and vegetables pose a risk			1
' dr @entity28 said a few years ago an outbreak of @entity27 left experts baffled , until they discovered the common link was leeks and potatoes			1
around 250 people were affected , suffering violent food poisoning			2
' you tend to eat those vegetables cooked , ' she told @entity96			0
' but it is easy to forget that these root vegetables were pulled from the ground and so were covered in organisms and bacteria from the ground			0
' this is especially the case for organic vegetables , which have been fertilised in animal manure			0
' if you wash them in the sink , you can transfer the bacteria to your hands and the washing up bowl			2
' so it is vital people wash their hands properly after preparing them			2
' describing the ' journey of the germ ' , dr @entity28 explained how bacteria , which is harmless in one place , makes it to the gut where it becomes dangerous , threatening to trigger food poisoning			1
she said organisms are picked up on a person 's hand and when they fail to wash their hands properly , the bacteria can be spread quickly through the home , landing on any surface a person touches			1
' some of these bacteria are very infectious , even in small numbers , ' she said			0
' just a few organisms on a person 's hand can be transferred to door handles , tea towels , cloths and other surfaces where they multiply quickly			0
' if someone else comes along and touches the contaminated surfaces , they can pick up the bacteria , and if they then eat something with their hands , could be at risk of food poisoning			1
' the simple act of really washing your hands properly will really destroy most bacteria and stop it spreading			2
' as few as 500 campylobacter bacteria or just 10 @entity27 organisms can cause food poisoning			1
you would need to have millions of @entity27 in one place before you could see them			0
' dr @entity28 said while many people just ' swill ' their hands in warm water , it is not sufficient to kill harmful bacteria			1
in fact , it is the act of rubbing your hands together that will rid them of the bacteria , rather than the hot water killing it off			0
' to kill bacteria you need water much hotter than it is bearable to touch , ' she told @entity96			0
' it is the rubbing action of washing your hands that rids your hands of the bacteria			2
' the water does n't kill it off but rubbing your hands together for longer than 20 seconds and really getting under the nails will remove the organisms			2
' if i really manhandle chicken , like if i am marinading it , i will always wash my hands twice			2
anti-bacterial hand wash really helps too			0
' but she said as important as washing your hands , is disinfecting all kitchen utensils and surfaces after preparing raw meat and vegetables			1
for some utensils the dishwasher is the best option , as long as the wash is at least 65 Â° c , dr @entity28 said			1
but for surfaces and chopping boards , it is important to use disinfectant , she added			1
' a lot of government advice suggests having different coloured chopping boards for meat and veg , but in reality that does n't happen , ' she said			1
' the only way to control bacteria and stop the spread is to use disinfectant			0
if you can touch it , disinfect it , just using water wo n't kill the bacteria			0
' washing up without using disinfectant merely transfers and spreads the bacteria from the chopping board to washing up brush or cloth and tea towel			2
the only fail safe way to combat these organisms is to use the dishwasher or disinfectant , she added			0
and when it comes to kitchen cloths , dr @entity28 said the only way to ensure they are safe is to put them through the washing machine , or boil them in water everyday			1
she said : ' the reason your kitchen cloth smells is because it is infested with bacteria			0
' seventy - five per cent of kitchen cloths have traces of @entity27 , so either bin them each day or make sure you wash them at a high temperature everyday			2
' but she said , people do not have to ' completely panic '			0
' this is n't about having a major deep clean every day , rather targeted cleaning , ' she reassured			0
' cleaning the right place at the right time and avoiding touching things like raw meat and vegetables as much as possible			1
' she said when preparing chicken , for example , she uses a fork to chop it up and transfer it straight to the pan , before immediately disinfecting and cleaning the utensils she has used			0
' that way i am avoiding transferring any bacteria around my home , ' she said			0
the @entity18 advises using disinfectant wipes , such as @entity263 anti-bacterial surface wipes , on chopping boards as they eliminate 99.9 per cent of bacteria .			1

new survey reveals 40 *%* of all food poisoning cases are caused by poor hygiene in the home
@entity27 , salmonella and @entity80 bacteria can spread via chopping boards that have n't been cleaned properly
food hygiene expert dr @entity28 warned all raw meat , poultry and vegetables should be seen as a risk
she said the only way to be safe is to use a disinfectant spray or wipe or wash utensils in the dishwasher
advises washing hands twice after handling raw chicken - and says it 's vital to rub hands together to remove germs
