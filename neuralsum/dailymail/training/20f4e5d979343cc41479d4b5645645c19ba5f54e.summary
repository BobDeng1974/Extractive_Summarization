@entity0 has bowed to pressure from animal welfare campaigners and decided to stop selling ‘ cruel ’ foie gras on its @entity5 website			1
the product , which comes from ducks and geese that are force fed to make their livers grow to a large an unnatural size , has been added to a list of prohibited items			0
it is highly prized by some food lovers and celebrity chefs , such as @entity19 , who have included it on their menus for many years			0
it presented @entity0 with video evidence of the suffering caused by its production and a petition signed by over 10,000 opponents of the trade			1
the campaign followed an investigation in @entity44 which showed shocking images of force feeding at a farm that supplied products sold through @entity0			1
footage from a farm belonging to a producer called @entity52 showed distressing scenes of ducks being given huge amounts of grain with pneumatic pumps			0
animal rights group @entity58 ! launched a campaign to show @entity0 how birds are treated at farms in @entity44 where some of its products originate they lobbied @entity0 with posters and video evidence that they say showed the products it was selling came from farms where birds were treated ' cruelly ' these birds were seen in group cages where an automatic bar pins the ducks to the floor to prevent them avoiding being force fed. production of foie gras is illegal in the @entity5 as it would break existing animal welfare law , however it is not against the law to sell imported products			1
before the ban , the @entity5 @entity80 grocery section offered more than 100 products containing foie gras , including 75g cans for £ 15			1
both @entity0 and third party retailers sold the controversial food			2
@entity87 , campaigns manager at @entity58 , said : ‘ @entity88 is mostly produced by imprisoning birds in cages so tiny they ca n’t move , by forcing a pipe down their throats and force feeding them until their livers swell to ten times their natural size			2
the birds were kept in small cages , with little room to move and force fed grain the caged animals have no natural light and can barely move ‘ i ca n’t imagine why anyone would want to eat it – or be involved in its sale			2
it is quite simply torture in a tin			0
there is nothing humane about mechanically inducing disease in a bird			0
’ he described @entity0 ’s decision to stop selling it as ‘ an incredible victory ’ for anyone who cares about the welfare of animals			0
mr @entity87 said : ‘ @entity0 should be congratulated for taking an ethical lead by delisting foie gras in the @entity5 , but we hope that ethical stance is expanded worldwide			1
‘ this is a perfect example that consumer pressure does work , even with corporate giants such as @entity0			0
@entity0 has now removed more than 100 products containing foie gras from its supplies praising the company , @entity87 , campaigns manager at @entity58 ! , said : ¿ @entity0 should be congratulated for taking an ethical lead by delisting foie gras in the @entity5 , but we hope that ethical stance is expanded worldwide ' ‘ we will be extending our campaign to other online retailers , such as @entity136			1
we must not lose sight of the fact that foie gras is a peculiarly un-british cruelty			1
‘ it would be illegal to produce in @entity5 and causes untold suffering to millions of birds every year in @entity44 and other countries that produce it			1
’ the organisation is calling on the @entity5 government to ban imports			0
the campaign against foie gras , which also includes the @entity151 organisation , has gathered a host of celebrity backers , including sir @entity154 , sir @entity155 and @entity156			2
