it takes practice to perfect shuffling a deck of cards in a fast and flashy way			1
but a mathematician has pointed out that card aerobatics do not guarantee a random and well shuffled pack			2
@entity8 compared different shuffling techniques and it seems that the ' riffle shuffle ' , which involves cutting a deck in half and shuffling the halves into each other , is the most time effective - if done well			1
but if they use a flashier overhand shuffle , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results			1
this could still be fast in the hands of experts , but still slower than the riffle method			0
‘ there 's a third way of mixing cards - used in poker tournaments and @entity59 - i call that smooshing , ’ dr @entity8 said			1
in a video for @entity28 , dr @entity8 compared shuffling styles to explain their efficiency ( illustrated ) if a dealer uses an overhand shuffle ( pictured ) , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results to the riffle shuffle @entity71 technique : cutting a pack of cards in half and quickly shuffling them into each other			1
efficiency : a dealer needs to repeat the process seven times to ransomise the pack and this can be done in less than 30 seconds			1
@entity84 technique : quickly inserting chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other			2
efficiency : a dealer needs to do this 10,000 times to achieve similar results			1
smooshing method technique : randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again			1
efficiency : one minute of smooshing guarantees a random pack of cards			1
simple method what : taking one card from the top of a deck and inserting it at random			0
efficiency : it takes 200 or so ' pokes ' to randomise a deck , making progress slow			0
the method , which is also known as wash , corgi and chemmy , involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again			2
it is used in professional poker tournaments			0
the method looks random and is – if it is done for a long enough period time			0
‘ if you smoosh for a minute it passes every test we 've ever thrown at it			0
‘ if you smoosh for 30 seconds , it seems ok , but less than that it starts failing tests and someone could make money against you or guess cards , ' dr @entity8 said			0
this means that while the method is thorough , if done for a minute , it too is slower than the riffle method			0
a technique called smooshing ( pictured ) also known as wash , corgi and chemmy , involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again			1
it needs to be done for around one minute for the cards to be truly random and difficult to guess dr @entity8 explained in the video how mathematicians check that shuffling is random			1
he said that there are a staggering 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 configurations in a perfectly random deck			0
‘ it 's more than the number of particles in the universe , ’ he said			0
one way of defining randomness is that all card configurations should be equally likely			0
he said that if a deck of cards is perfectly shuffled , you may expect to guess between four and five cards correctly as they are pulled out one by one from a pack			0
but if they are not shuffled enough – for example , if a pack is riffle shuffled four times instead of seven - people might guess nine or ten cards correctly			2
in the simplest form of shuffling , where a person takes one card from the top of a deck and inserts it at random , it would take ‘ 200 or so pokes ’ before the deck is random .			2

a @entity25 mathematician compared shuffling techniques
dealers using a ' riffle ' shuffle need to repeat the process seven times to get a random pack of cards , said @entity8
this technique involves cutting a deck and shuffling the halves together
whereas ' overhand ' needs to be repeated 10,000 times to get same results
the ' smooshing ' or wash method takes one minute to randomise cards
