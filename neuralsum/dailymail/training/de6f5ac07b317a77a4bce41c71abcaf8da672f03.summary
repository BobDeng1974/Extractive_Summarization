some bottles of brandy have labels saying ‘ specially matured for 40 years ’			2
they should slap one on sir @entity5 ’s backside			1
this mumbling , most untheatrical of men has been creeping down @entity10 ’s penumbral corridors since 1963			2
the @entity12 recruiters chose well			2
he is opacity and caution made flesh , a right tiptoeing @entity18			2
sir @entity5 , 75 , appeared before the foreign affairs select committee to discuss the delays to his @entity23 inquiry			1
@entity25 explanation came there none			2
but at least he turned up on time			2
he might easily have wandered in four years late			0
he was halting in a sir @entity36 way , inserting delay - coughs and creaky erms and aahs into his answers			1
he made little jokes about how he did not want to use ‘ mandarin language ’ ( not that this stopped him )			0
he was treated by the committee with such care , they could have been carrying brimful bowls of soup across a tightrope			1
was this really the sort of dynamo who should have been entrusted with a £ 10million investigation into how we were hauled to war by the @entity59 regime ? he looked more like a grandad about to audition for a @entity64 ’s @entity63 advert			1
with a good - old - boy judder of the jowls , he amiably took his seat and started to read an opening statement			0
it was so windy that even the committee ’s establishment - chummy chairman , sir @entity70 ( con , @entity72 ) , lost patience			1
there was , however , sad news to start : sir @entity5 disclosed that one of his inquiry panel members , historian sir @entity79 , had died on tuesday night			1
that took the oompf out of proceedings for a while			0
but let us remember what is at hand here			0
hundreds of our soldiers died in @entity23			1
thousands of @entity23 civilians were killed			1
the war may have been one of the worst scandals in @entity93 politics for a century			0
is the delay to this inquiry not scandalous ? sir @entity5 said mildly that he ‘ recognised parliamentary and public interest in our progress ’			1
well , that was big of him			0
he told us a tiny bit about the ‘ @entity105 ’ process , the name @entity10 gives to the practice of letting anyone criticised by an inquiry have advance sight of the relevant passages ( this creates jobs for lawyers )			1
but , oh , the coyness , the secrecy , the reluctance to give frank answers			0
the former top civil servant was hauled before @entity118 to explain why his report will not be published before the general election he referred to the ‘ maxwell - ees ’ but would not say how many of them there were			1
why the hell not ? it completely eludes me – baffles me , makes me boil like hot jam – why such a statistic should not be public information			0
in the @entity131 they would be flabbergasted by such official secrecy			0
sir @entity5 ’s lips formed a little moue			1
he toyed with the committee , going all playful and cryptic			1
and the committee accepted his stonewalling			2
the flaccid @entity70 , with admiration , observed his failure to give a straight answer and said : ‘ i ’m sure you ’re thoroughly enjoying yourself			0
’ sir @entity5 : ‘ i ’m grateful			1
’ he was asked if cabinet secretary and @entity145 groupie sir @entity142 had kept his snout out of the inquiry			1
‘ i ’ve no reason to think otherwise , ’ he said quietly			0
a cynic might say that that was @entity10 - speak for ‘ of course he did n’t ’			0
negotiations with sir @entity142 ’s officials had been ‘ a very long , difficult and challenging discussion on both sides ’			2
translation : screaming rows ? have you noticed how everyone in this sketch has a knighthood ? @entity166 ancient sir @entity165 ambled into proceedings and put some questions to @entity169			2
they called each other ‘ sir @entity5 ’ like a couple of stalemated chess players			1
throughout his answers , @entity5 gave as little as possible			1
he was as spare and watery as supermarket ham , fastidious about rules , genuflecting to precedent			0
public opinion ? public outrage ? please			0
do n’t let ’s be vulgar			0
as he left the parliamentary estate in a smoke - glassed car , he was saluted by a policeman			0
how tolerant , how tame we are .			0

sir @entity5 , 75 , appeared before the @entity188 select committee
