by @entity0 last updated at 7:33 pm on 28th october 2011 a chief fire officer splashed more than £ 26,000 of taxpayers ' money on business class plane tickets to all corners of the globe			1
@entity8 's former chief fire officer @entity7 took trips to the @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to attend international @entity15 training programmes on business class tickets			1
he then charged the tickets back to the council at a total cost of £ 26,768			2
trips on the taxpayer : @entity8 's former chief fire officer @entity7 visited @entity22 , reportedly travelling business class the figures , which were obtained by the @entity25 , revealed the council spent more than £ 42,000 in total on overseas flights for its officers between april 2009 and march this year			2
@entity30 , council chief executive , admitted mistakes had been made and steps had been taken to address them			1
he said : ' around 75 per cent of these flights were booked by @entity35			0
' the majority were for one individual in his work with groups aiming to improve firefighter safety at an international level			0
@entity42 - trotting : the fire chief also visited @entity44 , @entity11 , famous for its red tulips ' regrettably , one senior fire and rescue officer often travelled at business class , contrary to the council 's rules			1
' the individual concerned is no longer employed by the council and we have tightened our procedures to make sure that the rules can not be disregarded again			0
' we will investigate the fire and rescue travelling arrangements and are reminding all of our staff of the need to minimise expenditure as a priority			0
' on his travels , mr @entity7 flew to @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 in the @entity10 , @entity44 in @entity11 , @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69 in @entity22 , @entity70 in @entity12 and @entity71 in @entity13 on a mixture of business and economy tickets			1
his biggest bill was the flight to @entity62 , which cost £ 4,103 for a @entity78 ticket flying with @entity78			0
the biggest bill the council paid however was a £ 6,004 business class ticket for another employee to fly to the @entity10			1
mr @entity30 said the spending was justified as the worker had to go on a series of flights in a short space of time			0
he said : ' this involved internal flights between each site , as well as the flights between the @entity93 and @entity10			2
' as this individual was making five flights within a three - day period , he decided to fly business class on the two between the @entity93 and @entity10			2
' so basically it was because he was spending the best part of three days on planes			0
' @entity102 chairman @entity101 said : ' to see this kind of spending on business class tickets at a time when services are being cut is appalling			1
' they should hang their heads in shame			0
