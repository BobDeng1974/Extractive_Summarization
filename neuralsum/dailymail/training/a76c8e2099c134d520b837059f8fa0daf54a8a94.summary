@entity1 winner @entity0 is tipping the @entity3 factor to help @entity4 lift the trophy again on home soil this summer			1
@entity0 , part of the last @entity4 side to be world champions in 2002 , thinks @entity10 has pulled off a masterstroke by including four of @entity13 ’s players last season in his squad – @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the big defender says it is a big advantage because the weekly intensity of the @entity23 will help them cope with the pressure of being tournament favourites			2
@entity27 man : @entity0 is tipping @entity3 's @entity18 to shine for @entity4 at the @entity1 ‘ of course , the four of them are in the squad because of their quality as individuals			1
but i also believe the fact that they play together helps because they understand each other , ’ said @entity0 , who now plays his club football in @entity4 for @entity29			1
‘ the @entity23 is one of the hardest in the world with plenty of great teams like @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity3 and @entity44			1
‘ it makes the games really hard and gives great credibility to those players , a great experience			0
i think being used to playing at that level is very important for a @entity1			2
‘ @entity3 is a great team and for me @entity18 is the player who can make the difference in a match			1
he ’s a very offensive player ; fast , creative , skilful			0
he can make a difference for @entity4			2
’ @entity56 maestro : @entity16 ( left ) sidesteps @entity57 during @entity4 training last week head boy : @entity17 beats @entity60 in the air as @entity4 prepare for thursday 's game with @entity63 steady on lads ! @entity19 and @entity17 have n't held back in training during the past few weeks ironically , @entity3 have only two players in the @entity68 squad compared to their quartet of @entity70 – @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity17 is officially a @entity3 player until the end of the month when the transfer window re-opens and he joins @entity75			0
@entity0 ’s @entity1 - winning side included star names like @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
he played for @entity82 at the time – they had lost the @entity85 final to @entity86 just before the @entity1 – and cemented his reputation as the best centre - half in the world in @entity90 and @entity91			0
‘ my favorite memory is from the final , when we beat @entity95 2 - 0 , to become champions			0
i was only 24 but knew it was such a great accomplishment , it would go down in history			0
still going : @entity0 is now playing for @entity29 back in @entity4 at the age of 36 @entity100 : @entity0 was an integral part of the @entity4 squad that won the 2002 @entity1 ‘ i believe this year , the advantage of playing at home will be decisive			1
everything is going to be on our side , and the history of @entity4 in the @entity1 and the quality of our players will help a lot			2
@entity4 has a great chance			0
‘ the current team has different qualities to my 2002 side even though it has the same manager , @entity10			0
it would be a hard match between the two – i think it would be a draw ! @entity0 is still stopped every day in football - mad @entity4 about his @entity1 triumph			1
‘ it does n’t happen to many players because the @entity1 is only every four years , so people still congratulate me and ask what it was like			0
‘ they also ask me if @entity79 ’s winning goal against @entity68 was intentional ! it ’s difficult to answer but @entity79 said after the game that he meant to go for goal because the goalkeeper ( @entity132 ) used to leave his position many times			0
' @entity0 has endorsed skills from @entity4 ( published , @entity136 ) , a children ’s football book to encourage boys and girls to read			2

*midfielder* ' can make a difference for @entity4 ' says defender
playing in the @entity23 will help @entity3 stars at the @entity1
