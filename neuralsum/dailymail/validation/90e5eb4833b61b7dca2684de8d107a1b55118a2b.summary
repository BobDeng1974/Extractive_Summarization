and parents who ‘ overvalue ’ their children risk creating arrogant , narcissistic adults , according to scientists			1
a psychological study found that instead of telling children they are better than others , parents should tell them they are as good as anyone else			0
the research , which tracked participants for 18 months , suggests there is a fine line between self - esteem and narcissism			1
children who are repeatedly told they are special go on to have an inflated view of themselves , whereas those who are simply told they are loved tend to be confident and well - rounded			0
the difference is a child who thinks they are as good as others – and one who thinks they are better than others and entitled to special treatment			0
however , narcissistic children still have lower self - esteem than their more modest playmates			1
the study of 565 @entity39 children aged seven to 11 was carried out in a joint project by the @entity41 and @entity42			1
interviewed four times , parents were asked about their relationship and conversations with their child , and the child was asked how they viewed themselves and others			0
lead researcher dr @entity50 , from the @entity41 , said : ‘ rather than raising self - esteem , overvaluing practices may inadvertently raise levels of narcissism			2
’ professor @entity55 of @entity42 added : ‘ children believe it when their parents tell them that they are more special than others			2
that may not be good for them or for society			0
people with high self - esteem think they ’re as good as others , whereas narcissists think they ’re better than others			2

‘ when i first started doing this research in the 1990s , i used to think my children should be treated like they were extra-special , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m careful not to do that now			0
‘ it is important to express warmth to your children because that may promote self - esteem , but overvaluing them may promote higher narcissism			2
’ dr @entity50 suggested that parents could be taught to express affection without telling their children they are superior to others			0
‘ future studies should test whether this can work , ’ he said .			0
