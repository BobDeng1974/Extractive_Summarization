from headgear to hemline , a woman ’s outfit at @entity2 is strictly prescribed			2
such is the gentility of the racing festival that dresses must be of ‘ modest length ’ , with straps that are not too narrow			2
but with no rule banning tattoos , even the event ’s stringent fashion police can not do much about extravagant body art. @entity15 was one of several race - goers showing off their inkings on the first day of the festival yesterday			1
stunning : @entity20 soprano @entity19 looked wonderful in orange silk and was joined by @entity23 favourite , @entity22 , on day one of @entity2 lovely : @entity25 's wife @entity24 was a picture in pale pink lace , while @entity29 's girlfriend @entity28 opted for one of her trademark print dresses the 41 - year - old care practitioner , from @entity33 , has images stretching all the way down her left leg and arm , including a bear , a naked woman clutching her knees and a pack of cards			1
miss @entity15 said : ‘ i ’m proud of my tattoos			0
i see it as the colour of my skin , so if they were banned , it would be like discriminating against a black person			0
’ in recent years , it has become a less - than - stylish affair with fake tan , bizarre hats and micro minis becoming the norm			0
but two years after imposing strict sartorial rules , it seems that @entity2 has become a contender in the style stakes once more			1
@entity28 , girlfriend of multi-millionaire tennis star @entity29 , made a rather quieter statement by rejecting a designer outfit in favour of the high street			0
indeed , in her £ 155 @entity66 dress , @entity68 shoes and simple hat , the 25 - year - old seemed to have taken some style tips from the @entity71			2
@entity72 and @entity19 both seemed to be celebrating big wins from the balcony on the first day of the famous race meet famous friends : princess @entity77 excitably greets @entity19 at the opening day of @entity2 another racegoer leading the charge was @entity20 soprano @entity19 who looked stunning in a sunny bright orange dress and matching orange and hot pink fascinator by milliner , @entity84			1
her daring choice was echoed by many of her fellow race goers , most of whom plumped for bright hues - perhaps to make up for the miserable squalls of rain that sent many scurrying for shelter			2
@entity19 was joined by @entity94 and his @entity96 wife , @entity95 , who looked beautiful in a low key cream dress and @entity99 singer , @entity98 , who picked a slick black dress teamed with a showstopping gold necklace			1
also on hand to get @entity2 off to a flying start was @entity23 megastar , @entity22 , who chose a subtle monochrome ensemble , topped with a pretty black and white floral hat			1
@entity25 's wife , @entity24 , looked particularly beautiful in a stunning pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat , while @entity29 's other half , @entity28 , plumped for trademark prints teamed with a pair of delicate lemon shoes			1
in the paddock , a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers , although the odd shivering girl in a too - short skirt could also be seen			0
hats were big and bold , with floral motifs spotted adorning headwear up and down the course			0
@entity127 wore an artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms and a matching shocking pink dress			2
she said : ' you have to be a trooper to wear this , it 's quite heavy - but i 've been coming here for 25 years			0
' fellow guest , @entity137 chose an enormous pink rose made by milliner @entity140			0
she said : ' it 's made from layers of silk and is fabulous			0
i 've been coming to @entity2 for 31 years			0
i like the fashion , the @entity145 's and the quintessential englishness of it			0
' @entity149 mania : along with @entity23 star @entity22 , both @entity151 and @entity99 singer @entity98 plumped for low key black and white combos colourful : guests arriving at day one of this year 's @entity2 appeared to have taken organisers ' stern sartorial advice firmly to heart striking : londoner @entity158 and pretty @entity137 ( right ) wowed fellow racegoers with their stunning floral head wear no blooms for the boys ! this unlucky racegoer was ejected by @entity2 's style police for attempting to sneak through the gates sporting a floral headpiece blooming marvellous : race goer @entity127 from @entity167 looked radiant in a gigantic hat inspired by beautiful fuchsia bushes @entity171 classic : the @entity172 perform on day one of @entity2 , dressed in vintage style red dresses teamed with matching fascinators hats you win ... blooms have proved to be @entity2 's hottest hat trend so far , although for some stylish guests , less was clearly more cool couples : the wife of @entity186 guitarist @entity185 looked fresh and pretty in pale blue while @entity187 ( right ) , wife of @entity183 , was lovely in lilac former @entity191 racing pundit , @entity192 , was on typically bombastic form as he wandered in , trademark bowler hat and cigar firmly in place			1
like fellow female guests , @entity192 embraced the floral theme , courtesy of a huge cabbage rose in his buttonhole , although his wife , in a pretty pansy print dress , had the edge in the style stakes			1
also looking good was @entity187 , wife of veteran @entity208 presenter , @entity183 , who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat			1
nearby , @entity2 's phalanx of dress code enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide and skirts are modest - watched beadily , while surveying passing guests			1
and not everyone made the cut			0
one unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the @entity2 fashion police and was sent home to change			0
@entity224 , joined by the @entity225 and @entity226 , made a grand entrance processing along the course in a carriage			2
although today 's races did n't feature a thoroughbred from the @entity224 's own stables , her filly , @entity231 , is one of the favourites for thursday 's @entity237 - a race the @entity224 would dearly love to win			1
in the foreword to the official programme , the @entity224 wrote : ' i was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year 's royal meeting , so i know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer , jockey , or one of the many hard - working stable staff associated with every runner			1
' also in the running for the @entity237 is last year 's winner , @entity255 , and 2010 champion , @entity257			0
today 's races include the @entity258 , expected to be carried off by @entity260 horse , @entity261 , followed by the @entity262 , which will see @entity264 colt , @entity265 , start the race in pole position with bookmakers			2
body art : @entity270 sported a glittery dress while her friend @entity15 showed off her tattoos outside the @entity274 @entity275 : it takes more than a drop of rain to make veteran racing pundit , @entity192 , lose his good humour - just ask former employer @entity191 opulent : @entity127 , @entity283 , sports big pink blooms combined with ropes of pearls on her utterly spectacular hat day out : a trio of neatly dressed racegoers make their way towards the entrance carrying a pair of traditional wicker picnic baskets there 's always one ! this lady 's yellow dress is breaking more than one style rule ( left ) , while @entity299 shows how it 's done with a chinoiserie cloche hat @entity303 friends : colour - matching racegoers arrive in the morning of the first day of the meet traditionally dressed greencoats were on hand to assist guests throughout the course ( left ) and liquid lunches were the order of the day dapper : top hatted , dark suited gentlemen check out the form guide ahead of the @entity258 - the first race of the @entity2 meet last minute tweaks : a trio of unlucky groundsmen are tasked with making sure that no trace of manure remains on the pristine grass of the racecourse all set : the @entity2 racecourse has been readied for the five day racing event , complete with boxes of cheerful red geraniums and manicured grassy areas			1

the @entity20 soprano looked stunning in bright orange silk with a matching hat on day one of the race meeting
she was joined by @entity337 , @entity22 , @entity72 and veteran racing pundit @entity192
hemlines will be policed by @entity2 's dress code assistants who will ensure sartorial *standards* are met
rules include knee length skirts , straps of at least 2.5 inches wide and big hats , particularly in the @entity274
but no policy against tattoos , as one guest showed with her *elaborate* body art
the @entity224 arrived wearing baby pink , and in good spirits accompanied by her son @entity355 and his wife @entity356
