by @entity0 last updated at 8:16 am on 15th february 2012 as they watched a giant beast lurching through the water in outer @entity4 , experts thought they had found evidence that the extinct woolly mammoth was alive and well			2
but the dramatic footage is a hoax the documentary maker who made the recording has revealed			1
@entity12 filmed the video himself - minus the woolly mammoth - and said someone had doctored his footage			1
scroll down to see the videos woolly mammoth ? a still from the video that purportedly shows a prehistoric elephant crossing a river in @entity4 , @entity20			2
the footage is a hoax hoax : the original footage , filmed by @entity12 , shows the lake without the non-existent woolly mammoth divided opinion : believers said they can see reddish - brown ' wool ' or fur and clear white tusks			1
in reality , it was computer - generated inconclusive : the footage , reportedly taken by a government worker who was out surveying planned roadworks , is too grainy for anyone to get a good look at the creature it was claimed the clip was caught by a government engineer in @entity43 , @entity4			1
the video appeared to show an elephant - shaped animal with reddish - brown fur - which would match the colour of mammoth hair dug up from the perma - frost in frozen @entity20 - and a trunk dragging in the river			2
in reality the animal was nothing more than a computer creation and the footage was recorded as part of a documentary and captured by mr @entity12 during a five - day trek			1
@entity59 said in a video he published on @entity61 : ' i was alerted to the fact that a character by the name of @entity66 took hold of some of my footage without knowing it and created an elaborate hoax on the public			1
' he added : ' they took this video and , through cgi i imagine , created a woolly mammoth crossing a river			0
i did not give them permission to do this			0
' he accused them of ' staling ' people 's footage and ' creating a lie with it ' and profiting from it			2
suspicious trunk : the mammoth 's distinctive trunk seems to straighten out in some stills and hang lank in others - because a poor job had been done of the hoax it looks a litle something like this : a replica of a woolly mammoth on display at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103			0
woolly mammoths roamed @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 paranormal writer @entity66 , 41 , said at the time : ' it is highly possible that a number of species , extinct elsewhere , survive in the area			0
' and he explained that the discovery of extinct animals still alive in @entity4 would not be music to the ears of the @entity20 government			0
he added : ' if surviving woolly mammoths were found in @entity4 , it could run against @entity20 's plans to further develop and exploit the area 's considerable resources			0
' there is evidence of the woolly mammoth living up to 150,000 years ago across northern @entity105 and @entity126 , with the best preserved carcasses in @entity4			0
but the species had disappeared at the end of the @entity130 ( 10,000 years ago ) , with an isolated population still living on @entity132 until around @entity133			0
mammoth hoax : the original video before the footage was doctored hoax : filmmaker @entity138 reveals it was a con video that shows the ' mammoth '			1

filmmaker @entity12 said someone doctored his footage
