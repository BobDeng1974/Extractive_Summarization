@entity0 has been lying low in recent weeks			1
after the triumph of @entity4 , the @entity2 coach retreated to his home in the @entity6			2
on tuesday , he emerged , taking the trip north to @entity8 for his first public appearance since the victory parade in july			0
he emerged with a message			0
' after the @entity17 in @entity4 , our goal should be , and must be , the @entity13 final in @entity14 , ' @entity0 declared			1
while players such as @entity21 had teased the press in recent weeks , talking of how important it was not to lose motivation , @entity0 was clear			1
his @entity2 side may have already won the biggest prize , but they are not done yet			2
it is already being billed as the first step on the road to @entity14 , and @entity0 hopes that even the meaningless friendly can help his side ' reawaken the @entity17 feeling ' , before they start their @entity13 qualifying campaign against @entity53 on sunday			1
nonetheless , it is a very different team which @entity0 will now attempt to lead to glory in 2016			2
in @entity58 , @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity2 have lost their captain , their finest goalscorer and a hugely experienced defender to retirement since the @entity17			1
if the @entity17 title was the crowning of a golden generation , the next two years will be the foundation years for a new era			0
low has selected @entity70 as the captain to lead that new era			2
in many ways , the @entity73 player is the obvious choice			0
as vice captain under @entity58 , he was always an inspirational figure for the rest of the squad			2
during the @entity17 , he took @entity80 under his wing , and his determined performance in the final is already the stuff of legend			2
@entity70 is , however , already 30			0
it is highly likely he will retire after @entity87			0
he is also infamously injury prone , having only played one friendly for @entity2 in the last two years			0
his current knee injury even rules him out of the @entity39 game , with @entity91 taking over the armband			1
a long term replacement for @entity58 , @entity70 is not			1
captain fantastic : @entity58 celebrates winning the @entity17 but has since retired prolific : @entity2 will have to replace the goals of @entity56 who has retired from international football big loss : @entity57 ( centre ) has also retired from playing for @entity2 since the @entity17 rather , @entity0 has chosen him to bridge a gap			1
@entity70 's captaincy , along with the reshuffled ' team council ' of @entity91 , @entity21 , @entity103 and @entity104 , will ensure that this @entity2 side is still led by experienced players			1
the coach articulated this policy very openly on tuesday , saying that @entity2 's famous team spirit relied on a sense of hierarchy , where experienced players lead , allowing low himself the freedom to bring in young talents			0
some of those young talents will appear in the squad for the first time on wednesday night			0
defenders @entity117 and @entity119 have been drafted in , while other young players such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 now appear to be established members of the squad , having warmed the bench at the @entity17			1
stepping up : @entity70 will now captain @entity2 after @entity129 's @entity58 's retirement kicking on : @entity0 shows his ball skills off during a break in training on tuesday young guns ( from left ) : @entity38 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 will spearhead @entity2 now motivated : @entity0 ( centre ) wants his team to reach the @entity13 final in 2016 talking tactics : @entity0 conveys his message to young star @entity121 during training moving forward : the next two years will be a fresh era for @entity17 winners @entity2 all smiles : @entity150 striker @entity149 was in high spirits during a training session on tuesday this week will also see the return of @entity136 and @entity135 to international football			1
@entity136 missed the @entity17 through injury , while @entity135 was left out of the squad by @entity0			1
with @entity56 gone , however , the latter is hugely important once more , not only as @entity2 's only out and out striker , but also as another injection of experience			1
@entity135 's selection also indicates that little about @entity0 's tactical philosophy will change			0
the @entity164 player replaces @entity56 , and will be used as a poacher when @entity0 's more flexible , strikerless attacking system is being thwarted			1
@entity135 is another who is unlikely to last more than two more years , and may soon be sacrificed in favour of a younger striker such as @entity170 's @entity169			0
brains trust : keeper @entity91 will be part of a senior group of players expected to help lead @entity2 back in action : @entity136 will play for @entity2 against @entity39 on wednesday full of tricks : @entity136 was in high spirits as he trained with his team - mates on tuesday as with every position , however , @entity0 is embarking on a careful balancing act			1
his resources are almost endless ; @entity2 have a host of established talent and a relentless supply of talented youth			0
low and his new assistant manager @entity186 now have the task of ensuring that the team neither becomes too stale , nor too inexperienced			0
the basics will remain the same			0
when announcing @entity186 as the successor to former assistant coach @entity191 , @entity0 spoke of a man whose ' view of how football should be played is the same as mine '			2
that means attacking , it means goals , and it means youthful fervour			0
the new @entity2 will be made very much in the image of the old .			0

@entity58 , @entity56 and @entity57 have all retired from international football
@entity70 has replaced @entity58 as captain of the side
@entity0 expecting likes of @entity91 , @entity21 , @entity103 and @entity104 to help @entity70 guide side going forward
likes of @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 will also step up
@entity2 play @entity39 on wednesday in repeat of @entity17 final
