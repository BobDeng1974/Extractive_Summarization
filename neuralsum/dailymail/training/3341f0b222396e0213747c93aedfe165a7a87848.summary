a group of college professors have launched an initiative to help parents build fun wheelchairs and therapy vehicles for their disabled children			1
frustrated by the expensive and limited wheelchair options for children , @entity9 professors @entity7 , @entity10 and @entity11 launched @entity14 , which offers instruction in how to create wheelchairs out of popular toy vehicles for about $ 200			2
according to @entity14 , a standard toy car can be installed with seat backs , arm rests , or other structural amenities that make transportation more comfortable for children with physical disabilities			1
helping hand : @entity9 professor @entity7 ( pictured , left ) has helped create a method for alternative wheelchairs that are constructed of toy cars special idea : professor @entity31 's wheelchairs can be made in a matter of hours , by installing headrests , seat backs , and other structural additions onto the cars the trio initially started the program in 2000 , and have since created numerous instructional guides and videos showing how to remodel kids ’ four - wheelers to accommodate disabled children ’s various physical therapy needs			1
that idea has already helped create hundreds of affordable wheelchairs around the country			0
professor @entity31 revealed that the idea was inspired by a trip to the four - wheeler department at @entity51			0
he told @entity53 : ‘ anyone can build these in a matter of hours			0
’ professor @entity31 explained that the battery - powered cars ’ on - and - off mechanisms can be rewired to help build a child ’s strength			1
for example , he advises placing the switch on a car ’s foot bed if a child needs to build strength in their legs – as this placement will force them to stand up as the cruise along			2
wallet friendly : professor @entity31 created the @entity14 program to help parents create wheelchairs at a much lower cost than traditional models therapeutic : a trained physical therapist , professor @entity31 says that his toy car program can help children build strength too by strategically placing an on - and - off switch in areas that need therapeutic attention for those who need to add strength in their necks , professor @entity31 recommends placing the switch in a headrest – forcing the child to push their head against the rest , and therefore exert and build strength in their neck			1
he said that by using toy cars in fun designs shaped like animals or famous cartoons , disabled children feel like they are playing , rather than struggling to move through their day			1
‘ all kids deserve a ride on car that 's set for them , ’ professor @entity31 said			0
‘ that 's going to take a little bit of modification for some kids			0
it might take a lot of modification for other kids			0
but everybody can get around independently			0
’ typical fare : toy cars typically look like this and cost around $ 200 at retail			2

the @entity14 initiative teaches parents of disabled children how they can add structural support and rewire toy cars to benefit their child ’s *individual* needs
