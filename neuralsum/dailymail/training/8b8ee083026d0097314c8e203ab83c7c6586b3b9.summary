@entity41 killers : the @entity63 brothers , who were @entity6 of @entity65 heritage , were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - @entity88 in @entity69 and @entity39 in @entity70 , a suburb north of @entity4 neither brothers ' hometown wanted the terrorists , but were forced to find graves for them by a @entity6 law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed			1
