by @entity0 ' the man stripped off his clothes and left the socks on his feet			1
i looked from his wrinkled body up to his face			2
he kept smiling this friendly old man smile			1
'' " this is my first night , " i said			2
" i could tell , " he said			2
" i 'm honoured "			2
then he told me that i reminded him of his granddaughter			2
' for @entity12 , then just 14 years old , this episode marked the start of her short - lived career as a prostitute			1
overcoming adversity : @entity17 , now 36 , has taken years to recover from the trafficking ordeal vulnerable : @entity12 , pictured in her middle school graduation photo , was 14 when she was trafficked an unhappy teen growing up in @entity23 , @entity24 , her ordeal began after being approached by a man who gave his name as @entity27 during a trip to a shopping mall			1
blinded by dreams of love and a job in the fashion or music industries , @entity12 , now 36 , was easy prey for the unscrupulous sex trafficking gang in whose hands she ended up			1
but while stories of @entity42 or @entity43 girls being trafficked are all too common , @entity12 was a middle class girl from a sleepy @entity45 town			1
so what went wrong ? ' this is something i talk about a lot in my book , ' explains @entity12 , now a happily married mother who lives in @entity51 , @entity52			1
' often children who are trafficked have a background that is troubled in some way , whether sexual abuse in early childhood , domestic violence at home or substance abuse			2
' for @entity12 , the problems began when she was sexually abused by a much older cousin			1
the years of what she describes as ' mild abuse ' led to problems with her parents , who she says made her spend time with her cousin , despite her protests			2
' that followed through childhood and because of what happened with my cousin , i harboured resentment towards my parents , ' she explains			2
' that eventually led to a lot of anger between me and my parents and then at middle school , i fell into a bad crowd			1
i was what you would call a problem child			2
' by the time she reached her early teens , @entity12 had become rebellious , running away from home on several occasions and dressing provocatively in a bid to gain attention			1
sadly for @entity12 , she did indeed become the subject of adult attention : the attention of a trafficking gang intent on exploiting the vulnerable teen			1
' all children are vulnerable to crossing paths with traffickers , ' adds @entity12 , whose book , walking prey , details how trafficking gangs choose their victim			1
troubled : @entity12 , pictured aged 14 , had a troubled childhood and an uneasy relationship with her parents ' that day , that guy [ @entity27 ] was standing in a payphone booth			1
i do n't think he was really on the phone at all			2
' i think he was scanning the crowd and when he saw me i was straggling behind my friends and dressed in a way that suggested i was looking for attention from older guys			0
' the man approached her and flattered , she agreed to exchange phone numbers with him			2
he then spent the next two weeks chatting to the teenager over the phone , telling her she was special , beautiful and far too mature for school			0
' i was unhappy at home - i was coercable , ' she remembers			0
' traffickers take time with victims , feeling them out and convincing them to run away			2
' he told me things that made me feel good about myself ; that i was pretty enough to be a model			0
he painted a picture of a glamorous lifestyle to me			0
advocacy : since meeting a fellow survivor in 2009 , @entity12 has become an anti-trafficking advocate important work : she travels around the world speaking about her experiences ' he told me things like he could introduce me to famous people , get me into clubs and get me a job in the fashion or music industries			1
' enraptured with the wonderful future that @entity27 appeared to be offering her , @entity12 agreed to run away with him less than two weeks after they met			1
but things swiftly began to go wrong			0
writing in walking prey , she details the shocking moment when she finally realised what @entity27 's intentions really were			1
' nobody said the word prostitution , ' she writes			0
' it just hung in the air			0
everything was moving so quickly			0
' nobody asked me if i was ok with this , or if this was what i had signed up for , or if i wanted some time to think about it			0
' neither @entity27 or @entity161 asked me anything at all			1
@entity161 called for a taxi and the two of us were on the way to @entity167			1
' what followed was horrifying			0
' when the first man approached me , i do n't even think i was thinking of anything , ' remembers @entity12			1
' i was overloaded with info and completely out of my element			0
i just think that i was going through the motions			0
' at 14 , i did n't really have a solid idea of consequences and i still did n't completely understand prostitution			2
there were several men that night and the following night			0
' in addition to the clients , the vulnerable schoolgirl was also raped by @entity27			1
but salvation was at hand in the form of a policeman who approached her on the street to ask how old she was			0
frightening : most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue harrowing : @entity12 's book , walking prey , documents her experiences and is out now at first , she stuck to the patter @entity27 had given her but as the policeman walked away , she called out to him			1
' what if i was n't [ over 18 ] ? ' she asked			0
' when the police officer walked away from me , i realised that if i did n't reach out and say something , this [ prostitution ] would continue , ' she remembers			2
' i knew if i did n't say anything , it would continue			0
' just 36 hours after running away with @entity27 , @entity12 was back with her parents			1
but her problems did n't end there			0
her parents had no idea how to handle what had happened , and @entity12 herself needed years to come to terms with being trafficked			1
' by the time my parents arrived [ to collect her from the police station ] , i had emotionally shut down , ' says @entity12			1
' my few memories of my parents around that time are not great			0
i do n't think they knew how to handle the situation			0
she adds : ' a lot of anti-trafficking organisations recognise that the parents and families if trafficking victims need support as well			0
' they need to learn about what happened to their child , ideally before they 're reunited with them			0
my parents did n't have that time so they did n't know how to handle it			0
' for @entity12 herself , the process of overcoming what happened to her has been a long one			1
' it took me many , many years to overcome it , ' she says			0
' we need to get survivors to realise that they are not at fault			0
i thought for a long time it was my fault because i chose to go with him			0
' i thought what had happened to me was all my own fault			0
it took me a very long time to realise that it was n't			0
