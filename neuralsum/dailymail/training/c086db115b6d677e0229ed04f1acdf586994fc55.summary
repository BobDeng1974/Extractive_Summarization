the bizarre decision was branded the latest example of health and safety rules being misused			1
the unnamed female customer was visiting her local branch of the upmarket chain to buy a filleted trout			0
apology : a member of staff working behind the fish counter at @entity19 refused to fillet a trout because it was ' too slippery ' none were available pre-packed so she asked the assistant behind the fresh fish counter if he could fillet some from a whole fish			1
he agreed , but his supervisor stepped in and refused on the grounds of health and safety because the fish are ' too slippery '			1
on its website @entity19 says ' just ask if you 'd like your fish skinned or filleted '			0
in another case , @entity37 publishing company owner @entity36 said that a butcher had refused to bone a leg of lamb for him			0
he said the assistant had said he was ' competent to do the job ' , but was not permitted on health and safety ground			2
the woman who was unable to have a trout filleted complained to the @entity48 and yesterday the watchdog 's @entity49 ruled that she was in the right			2
in a statement the panel said : ' whilst fish filleting requires the person to know how to use knives safely , it is reasonable to expect this service to be available at a fishmonger 's counter in a supermarket especially when the website advertises the service			0
' @entity66 fish are a fact of life ! ' it added			1
@entity70 customer : the @entity48 ruled @entity19 was in the wrong for refusing to fillet a trout @entity72 , chair of the @entity48 said : ' i 'm glad the customer did n't fall for this red herring			1
this is just another case of poor customer service and nothing to do with health and safety			2
' @entity19 apologised for the inconvenience to its customers			0
a spokesman said : ' i 'm afraid we do n't know which branch this refers to so we are unable to comment in detail			0
however , we do offer a full filleting service and we 're very sorry that we got it wrong on this occasion			0
