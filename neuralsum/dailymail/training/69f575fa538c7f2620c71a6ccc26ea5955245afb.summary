by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 26 september 2013 rapist : @entity2 was jailed today for nine years after being convicted of rape a rapist has been jailed for nine years because of forensic evidence preserved by his victims thanks to an @entity8 storyline 25 years ago			1
@entity9 , 49 , dragged his victim off the street and subjected her to a brutal sexual attack in @entity13 in 1990			1
he fled to @entity14 and evaded justice for more than two decades , until new technology allowed him to identified and brought back to the @entity17 for trial			0
during the trial his victim , who was 20 at the time of the attack , told jurors at @entity23 that the vital evidence which led to his conviction was only preserved because she remembered an @entity8 storyline			1
when character @entity28 , played by @entity29 , was raped by @entity30 , in 1988 , her attacker was convicted in part because she knew to write down a comprehensive account , and to avoid washing to preserve evidence on her body			1
she said : “ @entity28 had been raped by @entity30 and i remember watching the story			1
' i knew i had not to have a shower or bath and i knew it was important to remember as much as i could			2
' the court heard that during the attack @entity9 has put on an oriental accent , saying : ' my name ’s sushi			1
' he was living in @entity13 at the time and working as a doorman at a club before making the attack on 17 may not far from @entity53			1
after the attack the victim rushed home and her husband discovered her wrapped in a duvet in the living room , @entity23 heard			1
inspiration : this scene from a 1988 episode of @entity8 , in which character @entity28 is raped by @entity30 ensured that the victim preserved the evidence of the assault her injuries were so severe that she could not be examined at first but samples were taken from her which would ultimately lead to the conviction of @entity9			1
he was extradited from his home in @entity14 earlier this year on the strength of the forensic evidence , which was able to be used after a cold case review six years ago			2
at court @entity9 claimed that he had had consensual sex with the woman , but he was convicted of rape by the jury			2
he was cleared of attempted buggery and jurors were unable to reach a decision on a charge of indecent assault			0
sentencing today , judge @entity83 said : ' i find it very unlikely that a 20 - year - old married woman would choose to engage in consensual relations with a complete stranger that she had just met			2
' the complainant to me was an honest woman			0
you on the other - hand did not give a favourable impression and gave me no doubt about how this started			0
attack : the then 20 - year - old was on her way home in may 1990 when she claims @entity9 dragged her from the @entity53 and brutally raped her ' you grabbed her from behind , dragged her into a yard and detained her against her will in a state of abject terror			1
the effect this rape has had on the victim was very considerable			0
' she was unable to live in her marital home , she was unable to return to her job and this incident had a most damaging effect on her marriage			0
' that marriage broke down			0
' after the sentence his victim said : ' i really want to thank everyone : friends , family , police and victim support			0
i could not have got through the last 23 years without their ongoing support			0
' i want my case to give hope to other victims of rape ; just because the offender is not caught or prosecuted at the time does not mean you wo n't get justice in the future			0
' @entity132 of @entity133 said : ' this was a particularly violent offence of a stranger rape which has had a lasting impact not only upon the victim , but was also remembered by the officers who investigated the crime 23 years ago			2
justice : @entity9 was handed a nine - year jail sentence at @entity23 today ' this case shows that together with our partners in the @entity146 , we are committed to doing all we can to bring offenders to justice			1
' the verdict sends a clear message to offenders of these types of crime that there is no hiding place and we are determined to support victims to seek justice and help them to achieve closure after they have suffered such serious crimes			0
' crimes of this nature are unusual and i hope that this verdict today will encourage victims of rape and other sexual offences to come forward and provide reassurance that their case will be thoroughly and professionally investigated ; no matter how long it takes '			0
