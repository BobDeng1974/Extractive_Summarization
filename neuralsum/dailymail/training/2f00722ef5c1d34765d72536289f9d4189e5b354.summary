this is it - @entity1 can ill - afford any sort of slip			1
forget @entity4 , @entity5 and even @entity6 ; the @entity7 is the scene of @entity9 ’s most important night of what has been an indifferent four months			1
not since the @entity12 champions dispensed of @entity13 in may – an evening etched with nerves – on their way to the title have @entity1 had so much riding on a 90 minutes			1
with the wealth of quality at his disposal , for @entity9 not to reach the @entity58 last - 16 would be unthinkable ; it could mark his eventual demise as the club ’s manager			1
and they are so close , knowing a win at @entity20 would seal a spot for the second reason running			1
if they were n’t to achieve the minimum requirement of progression , the failure would not be down to this week but those preceding it			0
the pressure is now intensified			2
but @entity1 save their very best to last			1
think @entity6 at the @entity73 , @entity74 on that final day			0
they will have to do it without @entity77 this time , however , who left the field in tears on saturday evening as they beat @entity82			1
@entity84 - sporting a @entity1 snood - throws the ball away during a goalkeeping session @entity23 looks as if he means business as the @entity1 players and management take a break city travel to @entity20 for a game they need to get a result from in order to progress in the @entity58 @entity25 dinks a ball beyond @entity99 striker @entity98 as @entity18 ( second left ) watches on @entity25 is likely to start up front for @entity9 's @entity12 champions in @entity52 on wednesday the @entity102 completed his sprinting drills at the back of the queue on tuesday morning nineteen goals already this season – including two late on against the @entity107 to keep their @entity109 hopes alive – goes a long way in pointing towards the @entity112 ’s importance			1
he will undoubtedly be a miss , but these @entity1 players know the importance of reaching the knockout stages			2
their careers in the @entity119 depend on it			0
‘ let ’s be honest , we need to do something or otherwise next year it ’s going to be new players , it ’s going to be everything , ’ said @entity34 ahead of the win against @entity6			0
‘ that ’s how it works when you play for a big club			0
with the salary of every player and the level of those players , 90 per cent of the team is world class			0
‘ then not to qualify from the first round of the @entity58 would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well			2
with the players we have and everything , the owner gives us his trust , we have to return it in the @entity58			2
it ’s the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world			0
‘ we have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way			0
sometimes it ’s not good to talk too much , it ’s better to talk with your feet			0
we have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well			0
’ the talking stops on wednesday , and do n’t bet against @entity1 coming out of @entity160 with the result they need .			1

@entity1 travel to @entity20 in the @entity58 on wednesday
the @entity12 champions are used to performing under pressure
@entity9 will be without top *goalscorer* @entity77
