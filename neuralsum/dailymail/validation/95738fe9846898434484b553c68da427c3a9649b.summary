@entity0 has endured a difficult fortnight			1
he is , of course , pleased that @entity3 won their first trophy in his time at the club , though his joy is tempered by missing the @entity9 final through suspension			1
and though he is now back from that two - match ban , he was part of the @entity3 team which went out against 10 - man @entity14 in the @entity16 last 16 on wednesday			1
he earned his two - match ban for pushing over @entity18 in fury after the @entity21 player executed an excessive shin - high challenge on him			1
@entity0 received a red card and did n’t even get the free - kick , @entity18 went unpunished			1
@entity18 commits a foul on @entity26 but referee @entity27 fails to blow for the foul @entity0 was handed a two - match suspension for pushing @entity21 's @entity30 at @entity31 the 28 - year - old has missed @entity3 's last two games against @entity34 and @entity35 due to suspension but @entity0 maintains a degree of perspective			1
he is aware he is fortunate not to be have been injured far more seriously			2
‘ i was happy , to be honest , when i saw the video after the game as it was bad			2
and i am happy that i played against @entity14			2
my reaction was not good but this reaction was because i thought i broke a leg			1
i am a happy man because i can walk , ’ he said			2
‘ i do n’t like to say that i was right in my reaction			2
but this was a moment when you can not control your emotions			2
i saw it one time only ( on tv )			0
but these things happen in football			1
i hope that is the last time			0
’ @entity0 has been a revelation since returning to @entity3 from @entity57 side @entity56 last january @entity0 will not discuss the fact that referee @entity27 did not award a foul , let alone punish @entity18 for the tackle			1
‘ i think that the referee saw because he was close but i think it ’s not my job to comment on that , ’ he said			0
‘ people have been speaking about that , writing in newspapers			0
’ asked whether @entity18 had apologised , he said : ‘ no. ’ before the visit of @entity69 on sunday , @entity0 reflected on his ban and keeping focused			1
‘ it has been very hard , it is very difficult when you are not on the pitch , ’ he said			0
@entity75 and @entity26 with the trophy after the @entity77 at @entity78 ‘ when you are on the pitch you can do something			1
when you are out , you are just watching and it is very difficult for me , i am not used to it			0
i hope this is the last time i am out			0
‘ it has been difficult			0
i was out but i was happy because we won two games			0
’ @entity0 is a candidate for player of the year , so impressive have his performances been since he came back to @entity3 last january in a £ 22million deal , having initially been allowed to leave and join @entity56 in 2011			1
@entity3 re-signed @entity26 last january for £ 22million having previously been sold by the club in 2011 @entity0 admitted it was hard to miss the @entity77 win against @entity34 @entity0 does not attempt to gild the failure against @entity14 , and is aware of what is now required			1
‘ to be honest we did n’t play well against @entity14 , ’ he admitted			0
‘ we played against one very good team with very good individuals but after the @entity99 red card maybe we thought it would be more — not easy — but easier for us as we had one player more			0
if you watched the whole game they deserved to go through			0
‘ now , we must win the @entity104			2
we have to if we want to finish this as a good season			0
if we win the league we will have that and the @entity9 and it will be a good season			1
otherwise it is going to be bad			0
@entity99 is sent off for his part in a tackle with @entity3 's @entity113 ace @entity114 @entity3 's players surround the referee as he sends off @entity99 ( second right ) in the first half ‘ i know it is going to be difficult until the end			1
but @entity120 also play difficult games			0
‘ if we win the @entity104 it ’s going to be like a dream for us , because we know what we speak about every day and we know the @entity104 is something we have to win			2
we are not tired and we will be ready for the next 12 games			0
’ none more so than @entity0			1
he knows how close he has come to missing out .			0
