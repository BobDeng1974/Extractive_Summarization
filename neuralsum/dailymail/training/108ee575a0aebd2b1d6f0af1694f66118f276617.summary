when the @entity1 mother of four brothers who fled @entity3 to join @entity4 militants received a one - line text message from her sons that they had arrived safely in @entity9 she thought it was a cruel joke			1
the message read : ' we made it to @entity15 , we will see you in @entity17			0
' it emerged on saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south - west @entity1 - as far as @entity21 and alerted the family last week			1
family friend and @entity30 community leader dr @entity29 told @entity31 the family had thought the message was a joke			1
' the family did n't know what to make of it ... they got scared and deleted the sms , ' dr @entity29 said			1
the mother even went to @entity1 airport the next day to pick up her sons who were meant to have been on a holiday in @entity44 , but they never arrived			1
the sons , 17 , 23 , 25 and 28 , are believed to be the latest group of young @entity3 who have joined is militants in @entity9			1

' my sons , you are dear to us , ' she said in a statement			0
' you are good at heart			0
you have done nothing wrong			2
' we want you back			2
i ca n't stop crying day and night			2
' one of the boys had told his mother he won a trip to @entity44 and was taking his brothers , who all lived at home with their parents in @entity1 's western suburbs			1
it is understood the teen was studying for his @entity69 at a public high school and the older brothers had stable jobs before they left			1
unlike some before them , the siblings were ' clean - skins ' and had not been on any watch - lists that would have alerted immigration controls			0
dr @entity29 said the family had no inclination the boys were at risk of joining @entity83			1
' the boys are simple boys , ' he said			0
' they are religiously involved but not hardline or radical			0
' dr @entity29 said social media was playing a big role in the recruitment of these young @entity1 men but there had to be someone manipulating the situation face - to - face			1
' ... and providing contact information through the networks and how to cross the border , ' he said			0
the four boys , one of whom still attended school , lived at home with their teenage sister , according @entity101			2
their family home have been searched by police			2
earlier this week on thursday , @entity3 federal police commissioner @entity105 told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were ' not on anyone 's radar ' , @entity104 reported			1
' we got wind of it after the fact , but the fact is there are still people travelling , ' said @entity105 , the national manager of counter-terrorism for the @entity119 , ' he said			0
authorities argue they need more tools to monitor suspects and prevent them from being radicalised many foreign fighters have already left the country including @entity125 ( pictured ) authorities were alerted last saturday when the family contacted a member of a local community after they failed to hear from their boys since they fled the country , @entity126 reported			1
on saturday , immigration minister @entity132 confirmed the family was seeking his help but unfortunately , it was too late			0
' @entity3 has lost yet another four young kids			2
this is why we are so adamant in trying to prevent people leaving to join these foreign fighters ' , mr @entity132 told @entity140			0
it follows the disappearance of ' ginger ' jihadist @entity143 from his @entity146 home in @entity1 's south - west in june and made his way to the @entity148			1
the 17 - year - old gained notoriety when he declared that @entity151 will not stop their murderous campaign ' until the black flag is flying high in every single land ' in the @entity156 video			0
according to @entity140 , counter terrorism officers have been deployed to all @entity3 international airports			2
this comes just days ahead of the @entity161 summit to be held in @entity162 , which will be attended by a large number of world leaders			0
@entity165 is also fighting with @entity83 militants in the @entity148 , and made headlines when he posted a photo of his young son brandishing a severed head @entity3 federal police commissioner @entity105 speaking at the investigation into new legislation in @entity173 on thursday police commissioner @entity105 also told the committee he believed federal police officers needed greater controls urgently , so they were better able to track the movements and interactions of suspects			1
' but the fact is there ’s still people travelling and regardless of what we ’re doing , we ’re not stopping that so we need some other tools , ' he said , according to the @entity101			0
though he did not reveal from where or to what destination the group travelled , @entity105 said officers are now virtually powerless to stop them unless they resurface elsewhere			0
' unfortunately , once they get into @entity9 or into @entity191 , there is nothing the @entity119 can do except wait for them to basically pop their head up somewhere on the way back			1
' @entity105 was speaking at an investigation into new legislation which aims to give security agencies power to issue control orders on people who are enabling or supporting terrorism			0
he also revealed that authorities were struggling to keep up with the sheer number of people being radicalised in such a short time - often less than six months			0
authorities said the ability to put restrictions on who suspects can communicate with and where they can go would allow them to greatly reduce the change of an attack on home soil			0
there are now more than 60 @entity3 known to be fighting in foreign conflicts .			2

four brothers from @entity1 's south - west left @entity3 to travel to @entity9
when mother first received text that they were in the @entity148 she thought it was a joke
