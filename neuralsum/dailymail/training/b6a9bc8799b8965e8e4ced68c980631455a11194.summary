by @entity1 reporter published : 14:15 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 20:42 est , 30 may 2012 the @entity3 administration ordered federal , state and local prisons to increase efforts to stop prison rape by issuing mandatory screening , enforcement and prevention regulations in hopes of reducing sexual victimization behind bars			1
the @entity14 announced the regulations thursday on the heels of a new study showing that almost one in every 10 former state or local prisoners reported being sexually victimized at least once in prison			1
the new regulations are immediately binding on federal prisons			0
alarming : a new report by the @entity14 claims that inmates in state prisons were as likely to have sex with staff members as they were other inmates and that one out of every ten @entity30 inmates has been raped betterment : the @entity32 ordered federal , state and local prisons to increase efforts to stop prison rape by issuing mandatory screening , enforcement and prevention regulations state prisons face losing federal money if they do n't comply , and local jails will not be able to get re-accredited without falling in line			1
the @entity43 also ordered that all federal detainment facilities outside of the prison system come up with ways to fight prison rape within a year			2
the findings , reported by the @entity49 in the first - ever @entity50 , may indicate a greater problem with sexual victimization than previously thought			0
surveyors found that 9.6 per cent of former inmates said they were sexually victimized in jails , prisons and halfway houses			1
a somewhat similar survey of still - imprisoned convicts done by the same agency in 2008 - 2009 found that only 4.4 per cent of state and federal inmates said they were sexually victimized			2
the difference may be because the former inmates in the current survey were asked about a longer time period than in the previous survey , said @entity68 , one of the authors of the survey			0
startling results : surveyors found that 9.6 per cent of former inmates said they were sexually victimized in jails , prisons and halfway houses reform : the new regulations are immediately binding on federal prisons , while state prisons face losing federal money if they do n't comply but it also could be that former inmates may be more willing to talk about the sexual victimization than the inmates currently housed inside those facilities , who have concerns about retaliation or retribution for speaking up			1
critics have said inmates may be willing to lie on these surveys in an attempt to embarrass a facility or refuse to report an incident for fear of retaliation			0
‘ by looking at inmates who are out of that environment , who no longer have that immediate fear of retaliation , of retribution , who moreover do n't have an immediate motivation to falsely accuse since they 're out of the facility entirely , we get a sense that through interviewing these former inmates that our past work is confirmed , that some of the concerns about false negatives and false positives may have been overstated , ’ @entity68 told the @entity106			0
the study defines sexual victimization as all types of unwanted sexual activity with other inmates , abusive sexual activity with other inmates and both willing and unwilling sexual activity with staff .			0

report by @entity14 says that one out of ten inmates is sexually victimized at least once while in prison
*majority* of sexual victimization occurs at state prisons , report shows
after report *'s* release , @entity43 immediately ordered prisons increase efforts to stop rape
