out there in the big bad world of the @entity3 , @entity0 believes everyone has got it in for @entity6 again			1
he is convinced there is an orchestrated campaign , a deliberate attempt to undermine the league leaders as they enter the second half of the season			2
on these occasions you are usually inclined to think he is off his rocker , having him down as barking mad at the perceived injustices to his blue - eyed boys			2
maybe this time , though , he has a point			0
‘ there is a campaign - not against me , but against @entity6 , ’ he claimed after @entity21 was denied a 55th - minute penalty at @entity23 ’s on sunday			1
@entity0 shows his frustration as @entity21 is fouled against @entity27 @entity0 believes there is a deliberate attempt to undermine @entity6 when penalties are not given penalties given in @entity3 2014 - 15 @entity32 - 5 @entity33 - 4 @entity34 - 4 @entity35 - 3 @entity36 - 3 @entity37 - 3 @entity38 - 2 @entity39 - 2 @entity6 - 2 @entity40 - 2 @entity27 - 1 @entity41 - 1 @entity42 - 1 @entity43 - 1 @entity44 - 1 @entity45 - 1 @entity46 - 1 @entity47 - 1 @entity48 - 0 @entity49 - 0 @entity0 should not have been surprised because @entity6 have only been awarded two penalties this season			1
they were scored by @entity54 , one in the 2 - 0 victory over @entity33 at @entity56 on october 5 and another against @entity35 on november 1			1
since then , they have n’t had a sniff			0
on the face of it , with the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity54 , @entity21 and @entity65 running rings around their opponents in the penalty area , it seems inconceivable that they have not won more decisions			1
that group play some of the most intricate football in the @entity3 and yet @entity32 ( five ) , @entity34 and @entity33 ( four ) , @entity36 , @entity35 and @entity27 ( three ) have all had more penalties			2
@entity6 , @entity38 and @entity40 have been awarded two ; @entity44 one ; @entity49 have not had a single penalty under @entity76			1
so much for the big clubs getting all the big decisions			2
in the past few weeks , largely thanks to @entity81 ’s ‘ @entity87 ’ comment following @entity46 ’s 2 - 0 defeat on december 13 and @entity84 ’s criticism of @entity85 on @entity86 , @entity6 ’s player have acquired something of a reputation			1
@entity84 had a particular view on @entity85 , accusing him of attempting to con referee @entity91 into awarding a penalty during @entity45 ’s 2 - 0 defeat			1
‘ entitled ? i do n’t know about entitled , ’ claimed @entity84			0
‘ they try to make referees ' minds up for them			0
‘ staying on your feet does not get rewarded if you are fouled			0
’ that provoked @entity0 , retaliating at @entity27 after referee @entity102 had denied his team a penalty when the score was 1 - 1			1
@entity106 , the match official for @entity6 ’s @entity108 clash at @entity109 , is under an extra bit of pressure because of @entity0 ’s outburst			2
@entity54 is felled by @entity113 against @entity33 - a penalty was given and scored by the @entity115 the same player was fouled by @entity35 's @entity117 and converted @entity6 's other penalty this season @entity119 , @entity64 , @entity63 , @entity21 , @entity85 and even @entity120 are @entity6 players accused of diving at various stages of the season			1
it must be said , they do not look like a team of cheats			0
still , @entity0 must accept that the decisions involving @entity6 will be scrutinised more than practically any other team in the @entity3 because they are at the top			1
it was unwise for @entity102 to apologise to @entity0 , particularly as @entity21 ’ fall inside the penalty area fell into something of a grey area			1
it is true that the @entity27 left back @entity138 tripped him , but the replays also show @entity21 flinging out his right leg before he goes to ground			2
why did he do that ? the @entity144 has never been noted for trying to win penalties or con referees during his club career			1
@entity119 was clipped by @entity38 keeper @entity148 in the opening game but no penalty was given @entity21 is incredulous after his penalty appeal against @entity27 was turned down what we do know is that the reaction of @entity21 prompted the referee to check with the fourth official to ask whether the decision was correct			1
half an hour after the final whistle , @entity102 held up his hands and apologised when he spoke with @entity0 in the dressing room area at @entity23 ’s			0
according to some officials in the game , it is normal practice to apologise to a manager if they subsequently realise they have made a mistake			0
each manager has his own way of approaching referees			0
sir @entity172 often waded in , ranting about a decision that he believed had cost @entity49 the points			2
@entity0 has a twinkle in his eye , a certain charm that referees fall for when he enters their dressing room area to discuss a decision			0
@entity120 throws himself against @entity46 and no penalty was awarded in a previous era , @entity183 once asked to sit in @entity186 ’s room instead of the visitors ’ changing area after he had failed to award his side a penalty in the final minute against @entity191			0
‘ my players have worked so hard all week , but how can i face them after what you ’ve just done , ’ snapped @entity183 as he took a seat on one of the benches in the referee ’s room			0
he had made his point			0
@entity0 has made his , drawing his own conclusions after his team failed to record a sixth successive victory at @entity27			0
it was way over the top , but that is the way @entity0 works .			0

@entity6 have won two penalties this season , both at @entity56
@entity49 are yet to win a single penalty this season
@entity54 has converted both spot - kicks for @entity6 this season
@entity6 have flair players such as @entity54 , @entity64 and @entity21 - with them running at opponents @entity216 should win more penalties
decisions involving @entity6 are scrutinised more because they *'re* top
