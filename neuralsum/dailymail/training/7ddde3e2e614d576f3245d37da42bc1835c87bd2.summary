scientists have discovered a way to hide large objects from sight using inexpensive and readily available lenses			1
known as ' cloaking ' , the process involves hiding an object from view while everything else around it appears undisturbed			2
and this particular device , called the @entity12 , uses four lenses in a line at specific distances from each other to make objects appear invisible			1
scroll down for a video explanation scientists at the @entity20 in @entity21 have shown off a method to make objects invisible using a system of lenses			1
here doctoral student @entity26 is pictured with a the so - called multidirectional ` perfect paraxial ' cloak using four lenses to make part of his face invisible - while the grid appears intact behind the technique was developed by scientists at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
the @entity12 is not a tangible cloak , though ; rather , it 's a series of layered lenses that makes an object at the right distance disappear			2
however , this is one of the first cloaking methods to hide objects in three directions when viewed at varying angles in visible light			1
in july researchers developed a breakthrough technique that enabled them to build ' invisible ' materials out of light			2
the method uses light like a needle to thread long chains of particles			0
and , the scientists claimed , it could be an important step towards building invisibility cloaks			0
the research , published in the journal @entity57 , described how engineering materials at a nanoscale level can induce invisibility			0
materials just a few billionths of a metre across can be built to alter the way in which light passes through them			0
known as a ' metamaterial ' , these can be designed to reflect light in the ' wrong ' way			0
' from what we know this is the first cloaking device that provides three - dimensional , continuously multidirectional cloaking , ' said @entity26 , a graduate student who helped develop the method at @entity76 , which is renowned for its optical research			1
to make the device , four lenses need to be aligned at a precise length			2
the lenses then need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus			0
doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens , or specific positions between the others , invisible			1
but the background behind the equipment will remain visible when viewed through other lenses			2
scaling up the sizes of the lenses can then also increase the size of the cloaking effect			0
their simple configuration improves on other cloaking devices , but it 's not perfect			0
' this cloak bends light and sends it through the center of the device , so the on - axis region can not be blocked or cloaked , ' said @entity26			2
this means that the cloaked region is shaped like a doughnut			0
he added that they have slightly more complicated designs that solve the problem			0
also , the cloak has edge effects , but these can be reduced when sufficiently large lenses are used			0
here the setup of the multidirectional ` perfect paraxial ' cloak is seen from the side			0
the laser shows the paths that light rays travel through the system , showing the region where objects can be cloaked			2
this region is between the two lenses on the left hand side where the lines converge by aligning four lenses in a certain manner an object is made ' invisible '			1
the background behind the object remains visible ( shown ) as light bends around			1
the scientists say it is the first cloaking device to provide multidirectional cloaking			1
and the technique could also be used to let surgeons see through their hands to test the device , which cost about Â£ 600 ( $ 1,000 ) to put together the researchers placed an object in front of a grid background			1
when they looked through the lenses and changed their viewing angle , they found the grid shifted but the object remained invisible			2
in addition there was no discontinuity in the grid lines , making the effect seem more convincing			0
they say the technique has some useful potential applications , such as letting a surgeon look through their hands at they are operating , and helping truck drivers see through blind spots			1
the research was published in a paper submitted to the journal @entity168			0
to make the device four lenses need to be aligned at a precise length ( illustration shown )			1
the lenses need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus			0
doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens invisible			1
