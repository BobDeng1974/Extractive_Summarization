a professional wakeskater achieved a world ’s first after successfully negotiating the water and surrounding snow of the @entity5 creek , known by @entity7 locals as the @entity8			2
according to @entity10 , @entity9 travelled to the mountain of @entity12 , which sits 25km from where the @entity14 were held in @entity16 , to attempt the experimental feat. dating back to the late 1970s , the sport of wakeskating started in the form of freeboarding or wakesurfing			1
different to the similar water sport of wakeboarding , wakestakers are not attached to their boards meaning crashes are more prevalent			0
@entity9 initially intended to ride the creek in the summer , but later deduced that it would be easier to do so in the winter as connecting a fluid line , which would allow him to move between the snow and water , would be more achievable			2
pulled by a 1300ft winch line , the video shows the 34 - year - old negotiating the creek effortlessly			1
carving his way through the water , he switches seamlessly between the untouched snow and the water before jumping into the air and landing a challenging trick			0
despite the fluidity of his movements however , the biggest challenge faced by the wakeskater during the experiment involved him finding a balanced speed			0
a ramp incorporated into course results in an impressive jump , but also adds to the number of entertaining crashes speaking on the video , @entity9 said : ‘ i wanted different speeds for being in the snow and then in the water			1
‘ i had to be going faster in the water so i did n't sink but then in the snow going that speed just felt really fast so it was kind of challenging			0
‘ but once we got the line figured out it was really fun to just session it			0
’ skating on the water and carving on the snow , @entity9 moves seamlessly between the elements in and around the creek although @entity9 does achieve a smooth and successful run of the creek , his experimental wakeboarding session is not without its fair share of impressive wipe - outs			1
and a ramp incorporated into the course – which later produces one of the videos most impressive moments – has @entity9 crashing into the snowy banks on a number of occasions			2
speaking on the video , @entity9 said : ‘ we ultimately just want to inspire people to think outside the box and maybe to take a sport that you would only see in the summer time into the winter and into the snow			0
attached to a 1300ft winch line , the wakeskater is pulled through the snowy creek at quite a pace a pioneer in his field , @entity9 has had some impressive wins on the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , the @entity118 , and the @entity119 ‘ we really had fun riding in these conditions and being here in @entity7			1
’ @entity9 is a pioneer in the field of wakeskating and has had some impressive wins on the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , the @entity118 , and the @entity119 .			1
