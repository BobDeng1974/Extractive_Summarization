following @entity3 's sacking at @entity4 , @entity1 's top flight finds itself without a @entity6 manager for the first time since 1984 – almost unthinkable for a country that sent down sir @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and sir @entity13 to enrich the old @entity14 and @entity15			1
four years ago , @entity16 @entity13 , @entity11 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 traded blows with each other in the @entity15			1
@entity3 was soon to join them , @entity23 and @entity24 were at the top of the championship , with @entity23 also leading @entity28 to a major cup final			1
@entity31 's reputation for producing the finest football managers in the world was at its peak and people studied what made them so successful			1
for such a rapid decline in their status is a huge blow to national pride north of the border			0
@entity3 's sacking means there are no @entity6 managers left in the @entity1 top flight @entity3 's reign at @entity4 was a testing time for the former @entity31 and @entity49 midfielder @entity3 's @entity4 side managed just 12 goals in 25 @entity15 games this season @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity11 were sacked , @entity17 followed later after swapping a big club for an even bigger one			1
@entity13 retired and on wednesday night the axe swung down on @entity3 at @entity4 , whose side have scored just 12 goals in 25 matches			1
it leaves no @entity6 presence in the hot seat since @entity62 took over at @entity63 on december 28 , 1984			1
the following summer @entity11 became the player - manager at @entity65 and blazed a trail for @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity17 that has been uninterrupted before now			1
while the @entity1 national team had to look abroad for managers because of a lack of domestic candidates , @entity31 was spoilt for choice			1
sir @entity13 is still the no 1 and his treble of @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity15 in 1999 remains his greatest achievement during his time in charge of @entity80 @entity13 chose @entity17 to succeed him at @entity81 but it never worked out for him @entity19 , who managed @entity83 and @entity84 in the top flight and is now in charge of @entity88 franchise @entity87 , spoke proudly of his roots growing up in the @entity91 area of @entity31 's largest city			1
' growing up where we did in @entity16 , you are never handed anything			0
you have to go and earn and make sure along the way , you look after yourself , ' he said			0
' i remember my father , @entity101 rest him , saying to me , never ever be afraid of hard work			0
and he 's right , if it does n't go your way , you will accept that because you know you 've given it your best shot			0
@entity9 's @entity80 were the first @entity1 club to win the @entity75 - in 1968 @entity10 was no stranger to wining silverware and is pictured here with the @entity76 back in 1974 @entity6 have five places in the list of the top 10 most successful managers in @entity115 history ' there is a passion , a drive , ambition from everybody to be the best and push everybody on			1
whether it is social skills in growing up with people , trying to get the best of others , i do n't know			0
' but what i do know is i know the other @entity130 managers personally , they have a real fire in their belly to do their very best			2
' but as the game moves on , the current generation of @entity6 managers do n't seem to have moved with it even though their coaching set - up at @entity138 is first - rate and used by everyone from @entity141 downwards			1
glaswegians @entity20 ( left ) and @entity19 are no longer plying their trade in the @entity15 rule changes in football have generally suited the attackers , leaving well - organised coaches like @entity17 vulnerable at clubs like @entity80 where you are expected to win every week			1
@entity3 was constantly criticised at @entity4 for being overly - negative and just trying to catch teams on the break			2
also , the passion that @entity6 have for football may not be replicated elsewhere			2
men like @entity11 were seen as old - fashioned by certain people within their club as overseas bosses like @entity141 , @entity158 and lately @entity159 brought in new methods and often a different way of motivating players			2
the highest - ranked @entity6 manager now is @entity164 at @entity165 , just outside the play - off places in the @entity167			2
maybe @entity4 should try to bring @entity13 out of retirement			2
trophy - winning scots who followed on from @entity171 and shankly in the @entity15 era			0
. @entity11 ( @entity65 and @entity172 ) he won the @entity15 and @entity76 double with @entity65 in his first season as player - manager in 1985 - 86 and then built a new title - winning team around the likes of @entity178 and @entity179			0
quit @entity65 in 1991 but later returned to win the @entity15 with @entity172 and though a second spell at @entity181 was n't as successful , he still led them to the 2012 @entity182 – the club 's only trophy in nine years			0
@entity11 ( left ) , with @entity185 , got his hands on the @entity76 and @entity14 crown in 1986 @entity13 ( @entity80 ) won an unprecedented 49 trophies with @entity80 , including a record 13 @entity15 titles and three @entity192 crowns ( two @entity75 and one @entity193 )			1
the son of a shipworker from @entity16 's @entity198 dockyards , he will go down as the greatest football manager of all - time , having turned @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 into superstars			0
@entity13 also led @entity80 , with @entity202 in their ranks , to @entity75 glory in 2008 @entity12 ( @entity207 and @entity208 ) lifted @entity207 from the doldrums and twice made them league champions , most famously at @entity181 in 1989 with a last - minute goal from @entity212			1
he built his sides around a mean defence and homegrown youthful players like @entity217 and @entity218			0
after a spell at @entity220 – he was sacked by @entity207 for financial irregularities - he returned to the @entity223 arch - enemies @entity208 and won a @entity182 there			0
@entity12 ( right ) celebrates with fellow @entity207 legend @entity217 and thousands of supporters after winning the @entity14 title in 1991 and being named @entity227 @entity228 ( @entity65 ) after starting his managerial career with @entity230 , @entity228 returned to @entity181 where he had starred as a player			0
although his term lasted less than three years , and he subsequently admitted trying to change things at the club too quickly , @entity65 did win the 1992 @entity76 under his stewardship , @entity228 leading his team at @entity237 against @entity238 against the advice of his doctors who had recently performed triple heart by - pass surgery			0
@entity65 won the final 2 - 0 in a game that made local boy @entity245 an overnight sensation @entity228 , despite doctors telling him not to , led @entity65 to @entity76 glory in 1992 @entity18 ( @entity248 ) @entity18 , a former player under @entity13 at @entity249 , led @entity248 to the biggest day in the club 's history when they shocked @entity207 at @entity237 to win the @entity182 with a late goal from @entity254			2
he later went to @entity4 but the fans never took to the former @entity256			0
@entity18 became a @entity248 hero after leading them to @entity182 glory at @entity237 in 2011 @entity260 mentions for			0
. @entity76 finalists @entity262 and @entity17 and promotion winners @entity19 , @entity24 and @entity3 .			2
