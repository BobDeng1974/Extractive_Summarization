by @entity0 published : 09:12 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 10:45 est , 3 august 2013 most new homes in @entity2 are being sold to foreign buyers at overseas events before they are built or advertised in the @entity5 , according to a property group			1
three - quarters of new homes in the centre of the capital were sold to overseas buyers in 2012 , with more than half going to those in the @entity14			2
data from @entity16 showed a rising proportion of mid-market homes were being sold to foreign buyers , who have traditionally favoured the most expensive properties , but that prices were rising			0
sold : many homes in central @entity2 are bought by foreign purchasers before they are even advertised in the @entity5 the worrying trend means @entity5 housebuyers , particularly first - time buyers , could find themselves priced out of @entity2 , where house prices have risen to a three - year high			1
@entity28 , from @entity16 , told the @entity29 that foreign buyers were buying average - priced homes in the capital as well as high - end properties			2
he said : ' we have seen a sea change over the past year in terms of the kind of price point foreign buyers are chasing , whether it 's a studio apartment in @entity40 or a one - bed flat in @entity41			2
' this is not the jet - set but rather the working middle classes expanding into the world			0
' many of the new homes are sold ' off - plan ' - before they are built - at glamorous events in @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , where developers can sell more properties in a weekend than they do in the @entity5 in a month			1
' off - plan ' : developers host events in the @entity14 where they sell homes from artists ' impressions and plans before they are even built trend : the boom in foreign buyers snapping up mid-market properties puts @entity5 buyers in danger of being priced out of @entity2 ( picture posed by model ) buyers who get a house ' off - plan ' usually get a discount , while receiving payment before building starts helps developers who can struggle to get funding for a project without evidence of committed buyers			1
@entity78 , chief executive of @entity79 , told the @entity29 : ' for a lot of developers , if you ca n't show that you can pre-sell enough to cover the construction costs , the banks simply wo n't finance you			0
it would be suicide to put Â£ 100m of your own money into the ground without forward sales			0
' more : foreigners buy nearly 75 % of new homes in inner @entity2			0

most new homes in central @entity2 were sold to overseas buyers last year

trend could price @entity5 housebuyers out of the market in the capital
