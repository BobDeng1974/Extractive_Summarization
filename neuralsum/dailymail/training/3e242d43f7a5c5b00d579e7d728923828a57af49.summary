by @entity0 a team of @entity3 students have broken a 26 - year - old world record for speed , which would make their solar car the fastest electric vehicle to travel 500km on a single battery charge			1
the car , which was built by @entity11 's top solar car racing team - @entity3 's @entity12 , was able to travel at an average speed of more than 100km/h , leaving the previous world record of 73km/h in the dust			1
but it is not official yet until the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , the world motorsports ' governing body , gives it the green light of approval			2
@entity3 's @entity12 solar car racing team set a new world record for speed with their solar car on wednesday it has solar panels on top of its roof and hood to charge the 60kg battery inside the world record was broken on a 4.2km circular race track in @entity34 - south - west of @entity35 - in @entity36 at the @entity37 on wednesday afternoon			1
the vehicle to smash the record , @entity40 , was the fifth one built and raced by @entity12 since the team was founded in 1996			1
one of the professional drivers who was involved in the world record attempt , @entity45 , relished the rare opportunity			0
' as a racing driver you always want to be on the podium and it 's not everyday you get to break a world record , ' he said			2
' i really enjoyed hanging out with the team and being part of history			0
' the car , @entity40 , was built and designed by a group of about 60 undergraduate engineers it took place at a track in @entity34 - south - west of @entity35 - in @entity36 at the @entity37 professional drivers got behind the wheel to get involved in the record attempt on the 4.2km racing track project director @entity67 - a third - year engineering student - was jubilant about breaking the record			1
' this record was about establishing a whole new level of single - charge travel for high - speed electric vehicles , which we hope will revolutionise the electric car industry , ' he said			2
the last time an @entity18 world record was broken in @entity11 was in april 1984 by a production - based , petrol - engine sedan , and the most recent @entity11 record was set in march 1994 by @entity79 in a jet - powered vehicle			1
but the @entity12 team are no strangers to setting records			0
they have broken records for the fastest solar powered road trip from @entity87 to @entity88 and a @entity89 for the fastest solar car			0
but the @entity12 team - which was established in 1996 - is no stranger to breaking world records the team has also broken the record for the fastest solar powered road trip from @entity87 to @entity88 the last time an @entity18 world record was broken in @entity11 was in april 1984 by a production - based , petrol - engine sedan and soon , they hope to take the record - breaking car to the streets of @entity88 , expecting to meet @entity11 road registration requirements within as little as one year and industrial designers from @entity104 have also been enlisted to rework the car 's interiors in preparation for its application for road - legal status			1
the team believes wednesday 's performance showed it was ready for day - to - day use			0
its zero - emission solar and battery storage systems makes it ' a symbol for a new era of sustainable driving '			0
' five hundred kilometres is pretty much as far as a normal person would want to drive in a single day , ' mr @entity67 said			0
' it 's another demonstration that one day you could be driving our car			0
' the solar panels on the car 's roof and hood to charge a 60kg battery , but the panels were switched off for the record attempt - meaning the car ran solely on battery charge			1
almost a quarter of the @entity12 team – which comprises 60 undergraduate students – made the trip to @entity36 to support the world - record attempt .			2

it travelled more than 100km/h breaking the previous record of 73km/h
the record was set on a racetrack in @entity34 - south - west of @entity35
the car has solar panels on the roof and hood which charges the battery
@entity3 's @entity12 car racing team built the fifth *generation* car , @entity40
the record will become official when it is approved by the @entity18
