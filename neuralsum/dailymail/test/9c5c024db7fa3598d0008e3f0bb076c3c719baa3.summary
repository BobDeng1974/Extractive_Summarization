exactly 19 years ago on wednesday , @entity0 made national headlines when she was arrested and accused of deliberately making her 9 - year - old daughter ill for attention			1
all grown up , @entity0 's now 27 - year - old daughter @entity4 spoke out for the first time on the anniversary , saying she has repaired her relationship with her mother and believes she was never abused			1
' @entity4 made it very clear : she thinks her mother never abused her , ' @entity11 lawyer @entity10 , who defended @entity0 in her criminal trial and released @entity4 's statement on wednesday , told the @entity14			1
chronically ill : in the first years of her life , @entity4 was in and out of the hospital as she battled chronic illness			1
a health care worker later reported @entity0 to authorities , suspecting the woman of purposefully poisoning her daughter with extra doses of medicine faced with mounting medical bills , @entity0 started lobbying for health care reform and would often speak publicly and with publications about her family 's battle to take care of @entity4			1
@entity0 even visited the @entity42 to raise awareness of the issue			1
then , in 1995 , a health care worker reported to police suspicions that @entity0 may have been intentionally making @entity4 sick by giving her extra doses of medicine			1
police and child welfare authorities launched an investigation , and after a year amounted enough evidence to arrest @entity0 on child abuse charges			1
@entity0 's lawyer blames the investigation on @entity56 - a syndrome that had grown in notoriety at the time of his client 's arrest			1
those with the syndrome enact pain on others in order to draw pity and attention to themselves			2
after the arrest , @entity4 was taken from her family and put in foster care where she remained until she was 18			1
after a long legal battle , a jury in 1999 found @entity0 guilty of aggravated child abuse and sentenced the mother of three to five years in prison			1
she served three years and was released in june 2005			2
still the two were not allowed to see each other until @entity4 left foster care , at which point she was an adult			1
against the odds , the two were able to repair their relationship and they now live close to each other in @entity87			2
while @entity4 declined to speak on camera about her life today , she issued a statement to news station @entity91 , revealing the fact that she is now married to her high school sweetheart and working as a social worker			1
' [ nineteen ] years ago today , on april 15 , 199 [ 6 ] , my life was changed forever			1
that was the day that i was taken from my home and my family , but that day has not changed how close my family continues to be			2
' the ten years i spent in @entity101 were traumatic , and i had some devastating things happen to me			2
' however , i persevered because of all of the angels that were there for me during these difficult times			0
these people helped shaped the women i have become today			0
' today , i can proudly say my family is extremely close knit			0
we have flourished despite the devastating separation ...			0
my parents and i have picked up from where we left off , and have a very close and loving relationship			0
' when asked for comment , @entity0 issued her own one - sentence statement : ' we are very proud of @entity4 and our sons , they have all grown up to be fine adults and dedicated their lives to serving others			1

i get a lot of joy making memories with my family , and making a difference in my community			2
although this is n’t always a happy anniversary , it is a day to celebrate my family and who we are today			2
my message to foster children : growing up in the foster care is n’t an easy task			1
actually , the odds are often against you to be succeed in life			0
i challenge you to rise up against those odds , and be the very best you can be with the circumstances you are facing			0
do n’t be ashamed or embarrassed to get the extra help that is offered , you will be thankful that you did in the future			0
there were many times that it would have been easier to give up , but its persevering against the odds that makes it even more fulfilling			0
speak up for yourself , be your biggest advocate , and be proactive			0
at the end of the day we owe it to ourselves			0
do n’t let your current circumstance shape your future , and never doubt yourself ! with respect , @entity16			2
