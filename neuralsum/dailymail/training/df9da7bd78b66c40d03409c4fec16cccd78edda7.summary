business minister @entity0 said he was ' shocked ' to be having to argue that ' business is a force for good ' businesses will today be promised a £ 10 billion boost in the conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit @entity8 's damaging row with captains of industry			1
business minister @entity0 said he is ' shocked and dismayed ' to be having to argue that ' business is a force for good ' , a question he said he thought had been ' settled in the last century '			1
in an interview with the @entity15 , the cabinet minister set out plans to cut regulation and red tape , saving firms an average of £ 2,000 a year			1
mr @entity0 also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start - up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious industrial tribunal claims			1
' business is a force for good in our society , ' he said			1
' it 's the first time in my adult life that a major political party thinks that being against business is good for @entity36			1
' we have to support and build our nation 's employers			0
this is where jobs and prosperity come from			0
coming from a small business background , it 's why i came into politics in the first place , and we 've spent five years working hard to make @entity36 a beacon for enterprise			2
' we are increasingly regarded as a good place to start and grow a business and we want to be the best in the world			1
@entity8 's idea that you can attack business and businesspeople without damaging people 's standard of living and jobs in @entity36 should have been consigned to the history books in the last century			1
' @entity8 has been embroiled in a damaging row with business leaders since turning on the boss of boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power			1
@entity70 has launched a series of policies supposed to target what he calls ' predator ' capitalists			1
the party has suggested it will not go ahead with a planned cut in corporation tax for large firms to 21 per cent			0
over the last week , more business leaders , including several who previously supported @entity8 , have come out to raise concern about the party 's anti-business rhetoric			1
shadow chancellor @entity86 , meanwhile , faced embarrassment when he could only name someone called ' @entity89 ' when asked to cite @entity8 's business backers			1
the row has left mr @entity86 facing a tricky appearance next week at the @entity93 , which he is due to address			2
mr @entity0 said the conservatives would go into the election as ' unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise '			1
he said the coalition had gradually cut regulation -- consignined 110,000 pages to the dustbin , saving business £ 2.2 billion this year			1
but a @entity104 - only government would go further , committing to more deregulation -- with the initial focus on agriculture , railways , energy , construction , retail , travel operators and the chemical industry			0
a review of each sector will take place this year if the @entity117 remain in power , and @entity120 departments made to implement a ' one in , two out ' rule whenever they introduce any new regulation			0
mr @entity0 said he accepted there was scepticism about red tape ' bonfires ' , but the coalition had made ' solid ' progress			1
most striking was a 75 per cent fall in the number of tribunal claims against firms following reforms introduced by the government to weed out vexatious claims			0
employees now have to have been working for their employer for two years before they can take them to a tribunal alleging unfair dismissal , and go through a conciliation process before lodging a claim			0
boots chief @entity144 ( left ) has warned it would be a ' catastrophe ' if @entity8 and @entity70 ( right ) win power			1
@entity144 claimed @entity70 ’s policies were ‘ not helpful for business and not helpful for the country ’ boots , which has 70,000 @entity36 workers , came under fire from senior @entity8 figures after the attack on its business policies but the minister said : ' there are areas where we have n't been able to go , because of the @entity161 -- particularly in terms of making it easier to employ people			1
' business secretary @entity165 has accused the @entity117 of wanting to make it possible for firms to ' fire at will '			2
mr @entity0 said : ' it 's about making it easier to take on your first employees			2
we need greater clarity that you can take somebody on and if it goes wrong you wo n't pay an unduly heavy price			0
' there is a lot of bureaucracy around taking people on and we want to make it easier			0
' @entity189 , the @entity189 star who now a @entity104 peer and an adviser on small business to the government , said : ' red tape hits small businesses harder than anything else			2
for an entrepreneur working all hours to build their business and provide for themselves and their family it really can mean the difference between success and failure			0
former @entity202 star @entity202 said government rep tape hits small businesses ' harder than anything else ' ' government should do everything it can to celebrate enterprise and back risk takers , but sometimes that means getting out of the way of their success			0
' cutting red tape has been a key part of this government ’s economic plan and has already saved businesses £ 10 billion , but there ’s still much more we can do			2
every penny we can save small businesses by scrapping unnecessary regulations means more jobs , more growth and more hardworking people able to make a success of their business			2
' @entity226 , director general of the @entity93 , said : ' government regulation all too often places excessive financial and administrative burdens on @entity36 businesses			0
after years of campaigning to cut red tape , it is welcome to see proposals for stretching deregulation targets for the next @entity234 — which would help companies concentrate on jobs and exports , rather than on endless compliance measures			0
' a stretch target for deregulation would also send a clear message to @entity242 that new rules must be a last resort , rather than a first reflex for mandarins and ministers alike			0
' @entity248 , director general of the @entity249 , said : ' the coalition government has made encouraging progress in reducing the burden of regulation on business , and in particular on small and medium sized businesses			2
we welcome the ambition shown in the commitment to finding a further £ 10billion worth of regulatory savings , and urge all political parties to consider how they can make it easier , smoother and more efficient to do business in the @entity36			1
the target announced by the @entity104 is admirable , and we ’ll work with all parties to make sure deregulation stays at the top of political agenda			0
' the next parliament will see continuing pressure of the public finances whoever wins , so we need to unleash business to drive economic growth and generate tax revenues			0
' @entity274 , @entity8 ’s shadow small business minister , said : ' the truth is that ministers have blocked @entity8 ’s plans to back small business by tackling late payment and to deal with unfair and uncompetitive treatment of suppliers			1
they ’ve opposed our plans to cut – then freeze – business rates , and at a time when net lending to small and medium sized businesses has fallen by £ 1 billion in the last quarter , they ’ve opposed our plans for a proper @entity36 @entity289 supported by a regional network			1
' where the @entity104 - led government has failed to act to support small firms , the next @entity8 government will			2
' it is now mandatory for a claimant to contact the @entity296 ( @entity296 ) before they can lodge a claim with an employment tribunal			0
so far @entity296 has conciliated in over 37,000 cases , and only 24 per cent progressed to a @entity300			0
increased flexiblity on firms ' audit requirements has saved £ 300 million a year			0
plays , live music acts and indoor sports displays no longer need to obtain a licence to perform in schools , nurseries , hospitals , circuses and arts centres , which has saved businesses £ 1.4 million each year paper tax discs have been scrapped , saving firms with company vehicles time and money			2
a requirement for retailers to notify tv licensing of the name and address of tv purchasers has been axed , saving them £ 2.5 million per year			0
@entity325 rules defining jam as being ' two - thirds sugar ' have been ditched , stopping firms such as @entity329 's , which have a lower sugar content , having to relabel their products ' fruit spread ' .			0

businesses will today be promised a £ 10billion boost by the conservatives
