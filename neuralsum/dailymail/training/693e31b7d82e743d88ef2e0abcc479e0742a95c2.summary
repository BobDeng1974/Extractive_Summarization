by @entity0 and @entity1 hundreds of @entity3 troops are set to be sent to @entity4 to help local forces in their war with @entity8 - linked terrorists holding nearly 300 schoolgirls hostage			2
details of the planned deployment emerged as @entity4 officials claimed they now know where the girls are being held but warned any rescue attempt could lead to them being killed by the fanatical @entity17 @entity16			1
air marshal @entity18 , @entity4 's chief of defence staff , said : ' the good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are … but where they are held , can we go there with force ? we ca n't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back			1
' a still taken from a video by @entity4 's @entity16 terrorist network shows the missing girls			1
a top @entity4 military official says the authorities know where the girls are , but can not move in over fears for their safety he refused to elaborate but negotiation has been continuing through third parties and it emerged yesterday a swap deal had been set - up to free around 50 of the hostages last week in exchange for 100 @entity16 prisoners but this was blocked at the last minute by president @entity47			1
with @entity4 's military said to be demoralised and outgunned in the face of @entity16 , plans have been drawn - up for @entity3 soldiers to be flown to @entity52 to provide specialist training to @entity4 forces as part of a package of assistance provided by the @entity3 government to tackle the threat posed by the increasingly bold militia			1
both ministers and military chiefs in @entity63 have yet to sanction the plans being put forward by senior officers attached to the specialist @entity3 team sent to @entity4 capital @entity68 following the kidnap by the @entity17 gunmen of the schoolgirls in april from a school in the north of the country			2
officials stress the troops would not be involved directly in the hunt for the girls or take an active role in any military action against @entity16 which has carried out a series of devastating bombings across @entity4			1
@entity16 leader @entity83 offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners , which was declined by the @entity4 government the @entity3 government is said to be anxious to give the @entity4 administration of president @entity47 help in providing security against the terrorists without committing any @entity3 troops to ' high risk ' deployments such as the hunt for the girls or placing them in a position where they could be drawn in to fighting the well - armed @entity16 gunmen			1
@entity3 , @entity99 and the @entity100 already have @entity101 , anti-terror experts and specialists in hostage negotiation in @entity4 helping to pinpoint where the girls - abducted at gunpoint from their school at @entity109 in @entity111 province on april 14 – are being held			2
pressure : @entity113 at the @entity114 in @entity4 @entity3 , the @entity100 and @entity99 have been using aerial surveillance , satellite intercepts and evesdropping on telephone calls made between suspected representatives of the kidnappers and their supporters to track the movements of @entity16 gunmen			1
the girls , who were mainly @entity124 , are thought to be held in the vast @entity126 forest reserve , which is three times the size of @entity127 , close to the border with @entity129 and @entity130			0
their plight has led to an international social media campaign to free them spearheaded by @entity134 and backed by politicians and celebrities , including @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
mr @entity137 along with the @entity100 and @entity99 have all made a priority of helping to improve security in the region - @entity129 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity130 have all experienced problems from @entity17 extremists			0
it is to help with security that @entity3 is considering sending a ' @entity147 ' to @entity4 where troops have complained of being ' no match ' for @entity16 , who have threatened to sell the girls into slavery in neighbouring countries			1
soldiers in the north say they have been issued with just 60 bullets and are said to be demoralised following a number of attacks by the extremists with dozens defecting to the terrorist 's own ranks			0
@entity4 troops have complained they are not properly paid , are dumped in dangerous bush with no supplies and that the @entity16 extremists holding the girls are better equipped than they are			1
some soldiers have said officers enriching themselves off the defence budget have no interest in halting the five - year - old uprising that has killed thousands			0
the military also is accused of killing thousands of detainees held illegally in their barracks , some by shooting , some by torture and many starved to death or asphyxiated in overcrowded cells			0
the role of a @entity3 force would be to help restore morale and train elements of the @entity4 army in how to track and fight @entity16 , whose name means ' @entity191 education is forbidden ' in the local @entity193 language			2
until recently @entity3 had a training facility in @entity52 in @entity195 where @entity3 military instructors trained west @entity198 countries in readiness for their deployments with the @entity201 on a project called @entity203			0
a @entity205 team from @entity206 deployed earlier this year in @entity4 and @entity130			0
colonel @entity207 , who commanded @entity3 troops in @entity209 , said : ' there is no doubt that the @entity4 forces can benefit from training and advice provided by the @entity215 , who are unrivalled in their expertise at countering @entity17 terrorism			0
' there are close ties between @entity4 and @entity3 dating back to the days when the country was a @entity3 colony , and both armies have long enjoyed mutual respect			2
' as well as supporting a close friend in @entity52 , this task is also in our national security interests as there is considerable cooperation between national and regional @entity17 terrorist groups and @entity8 , which sometimes increase the threat to our country and other @entity191 nations			0
' last year the @entity99 spearheaded an operation against extremists in northern @entity238 and they are expected to head any military operation against @entity16 with @entity3 and @entity100 special forces personnel directing @entity4 troops			1
a @entity16 video has shown some of the kidnapped girls reciting @entity246 verses in @entity247 and two of them explaining why they had converted from @entity249 to @entity250 in captivity			0
unverified reports have indicated two may have died of snake bites , that some have been forced to marry their abductors and that some may have been taken across borders into @entity129 and @entity130 .			0

top @entity4 military official says they can not attempt a rescue operation
' we ca n't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back , ' he said
pressure is growing on @entity4 government to bring the girls home safely
@entity4 military complain they are ' no match ' for @entity16
