by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 12:03 est , 20 october 2013 one of the most memorable images of the year must be the delighted face of the @entity3 as her horse @entity5 raced to victory at @entity7 just before her 87th birthday in april			1
if nothing stirs your blood like the stampeding of thoroughbred hooves down the flat and crowds cheering as the winner takes the final fence , this is surely the ideal living location			1
a new housing development - with a deferential nod to tradition - makes @entity7 the first racecourse in @entity23 to develop its extensive grounds for housing			1
it includes luxury , grandstand - style apartments with a direct view along the famous straight mile			1
@entity31 : @entity32 and @entity33 love their racecourse home the first recorded racing at @entity7 was in 1805 , but the racecourse itself was n't constructed until almost a century later , in 1904			1
a century on , it 's the @entity3 's favourite , and she visits it every year for her birthday			1
the historic nature of the @entity43 town , and the @entity45 connection , made it imperative that the new housing development , called living at @entity47 , was built in as sympathetic a style as possible			1
a joint development between @entity52 and the racecourse itself , it 's part of a plan to redevelop the venue and the surrounding area			2
in total , 1,500 new homes are being built in 300 acres of the grounds			1
the first phase of the accommodation is now available in the form of more than 400 townhouses and apartments			1
the houses are built in elegant red - brick crescents near the entrance to the racecourse and set among majestic and mature oak trees			1
prices range from £ 295,000 to £ 458,000			2
the first occupant , solicitor and racing fan @entity73 , was initially attracted to the development by its proximity to the racecourse			2
@entity80 @entity79 : @entity81 is breaking new ground with a 1,500 - home development but when she looked around the 1,875 sq ft , five - bedroom , three - bathroom house with her children @entity33 , 11 , and @entity88 , 14 , she realised that the location and layout made it ideal for a family with slightly older children			1
they moved in three months ago			2
' @entity88 has the whole of the top floor with a bedroom and his own bathroom , ' she says			2
the other spare room on that floor is for her father , who visits every weekend from @entity103			2
' he is a big fan of racing , and delighted we have moved , ' says @entity32			2
the @entity3 celebrates her @entity7 win @entity33 , meanwhile , says her bedroom is like a hotel room			1
the house has a front - facing reading room on the first floor with a vast window running the length of the wall , and a small balcony			0
this can be used as a second sitting room , a spare room or - as here - a bedroom for a very fortunate daughter			0
the bright and warm kitchen , with integrated appliances , opens on to the garden			0
' that 's what finally sold it to me , ' says @entity32			0
' it gets the evening sun , and the outside flows in			0
it 's like living between town and countryside			0
@entity88 is able to get to school independently , which he really likes			0
@entity33 is a massive shopper and we are ten minutes from the town , which has plenty of high street chains			0
' she was also able to go and see @entity143 singing at the @entity47 all by herself			0
' the theatre and cinema are similarly close , and the railway station - with a direct service to @entity148 - is just five minutes ' walk			0
the housing comes with the benefits of managed lawns and access to a gym and spa , and buyers can choose their own finishes for bathrooms and kitchens			0
the next phase of executive homes are the 102 trackside apartments to be completed next year			1
so far 25 have been sold			0
@entity163 , managing director of @entity164 , says : ' @entity47 , @entity7 , offers a superb range of quality new homes , ranging from contemporary trackside apartments and executive houses to townhouses in traditional crescents and squares , all set around a mature landscape of beautiful trees			1
' each element of the development is designed to complement surroundings through architecture and use of space			0
' residents will be able to enjoy access to the racecourse facilities year round , the @entity187 on site , and beautiful walking and cycling routes			0
