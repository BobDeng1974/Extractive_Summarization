if you have ever wondered how common your birthday is , look no further			0
a @entity4 graduate has produced a series of charts revealing how birthdays rate against each other			0
the graphs , created from federal government data , show that most @entity4 babies are born in the late summer , while the least are delivered on major holidays			0
they show that most @entity4 babies are born in late summer , while the least are delivered on major holidays perhaps unsurprisingly , september 12 , 18 , 25 and 26 - which are all around nine months after the holiday season - were found to be the most common days for births			1
they helped make up a total of 12,250 children born per day in the summer , compared to just 11,390 in the winter			2
this contrast in numbers is widely believed to be due to the cold weather experienced during the winter months , which encourages more people to stay indoors and spend cosy evenings in			1
university of @entity34 student @entity33 produced the charts using data from 1994 - 2003 @entity38 ( @entity38 ) records , before posting them to @entity40			2
celebration : unsurprisingly , september 12 , 18 , 25 and 26 - which are all around nine months after the holiday season - were the most common days for births			1
a total of 12,250 children were born per day in the summer interesting : public holidays - including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50 , as well as the february 29 - were ranked as the least - likely days for births			1
but @entity52 was popular they show that public holidays - including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and the @entity50 , as well as the february 29 - are the least - likely days for births			1
while february 29 is understandably rare as it comes around only every four years , the cause for the fewest birthdays on holidays is likely due to fewer cesarean sections being carried out			0
most public hospitals in @entity4 refuse to schedule c - sections on national holidays - with the exception of emergencies - while many private hospitals will arrange fewer			1
@entity40 users have also speculated that some doctors may deliberately induce a pregnancy so the birth occurs on a more convenient day			0
standing out : university of @entity34 student @entity33 produced the charts using data from 1994 - 2003 @entity38 records			0
strikingly , the day with the most @entity4 births was found to be september 9 , 1999 - or 9/9/99 despite the apparent lack of births of public holidays , @entity52 and @entity74 were ranked among the most common for deliveries , with an average of 12,210 and 11,210 respectively			1
strikingly , the day with the most @entity4 births was found to be september 9 , 1999 - possibly due to a high number of parents wanting their child to have a 9/9/99 birth date			2
while july , august and september appeared to be the most popular months to give birth , tuesday was ranked as the most likely day for newborn deliveries			0
sunday was the least likely day to give birth , with just 7,780 .			0
