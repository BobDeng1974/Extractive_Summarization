an interior designer who was cut out of her mother ’s £ 2.5million will has won a legal fight with her brother to keep her home			1
@entity5 , 45 , who once dated sir @entity6 , was disinherited by her gambling - addict mother @entity7			1
but a judge ruled yesterday that she was entitled to keep an £ 800,000 flat she had been given in 1995			1
@entity5 , 45 , ( left ) was disinherited by her mother @entity7 before her death in 2013 and everything was left to her brother @entity12 ( right ) the court heard that restaurateur mrs @entity7 , who died in 2013 , underwent a personality change after being diagnosed with cancer			1
she frittered away much of her fortune in casinos and turned against her daughter			0
mrs @entity7 left her entire estate to mrs day ’s older brother , investment banker @entity12			1
he maintained the estate included his sister ’s flat in @entity25 , @entity26			0
mrs day , who made headlines when she was in her 20s for ‘ stepping out ’ with designer sir @entity6 , 38 years her senior , said the flat had been a gift to get her on the property ladder			2
before her illness her mother , to whom she had been very close , often showered her with presents , she told @entity37			0
‘ she was always buying me things like mink coats and jewellery – you name it i had it , ’ mrs day said			0
‘ i was spoilt ... the flat just followed			0
’ but she said her mother ’s gambling addiction turned her into ‘ a harridan with a capital h ’ and at one point she feared mrs @entity7 would have her ‘ bumped off ’ to get the flat back			1
her mother had given her a luxury £ 800,000 flat in @entity25 , south @entity26 ( pictured ) 20 years ago but mr @entity12 claimed it was part of his mother 's estate during her final years , her mother had visited casinos every night and even resorted to stealing gambling chips , mrs day claimed			1
she said she lived in fear of her multi-millionaire brother , whom she called ‘ bully boy @entity58 ’ , and that he was jealous of anything their mother gave her			0
mr @entity12 , 47 , denied his sister ’s claims			0
but after a four - day hearing , judge @entity64 ruled that mrs day was entitled to keep the flat , which had been ‘ freely gifted ’			1
he rejected mr @entity12 ’s claim that she merely held the flat as a trustee and ruled he was entitled to only a £ 55,000 stake in the property to reflect a mortgage paid off by his mother			1
judge @entity64 also ordered mr @entity12 to pay most of his sister ’s six - figure legal bill			2
however he rejected mrs day ’s claims that she had been put under ‘ duress or undue influence ’ by her brother and mother			2
he said mrs @entity7 ’s personality had changed after her cancer diagnosis in march 2010			2
in a document she wrote in may 2012 explaining why she had disinherited her daughter , she claimed mrs day ‘ never came to see me while i had breast cancer and has been very disagreeable all her life since the age of 14			2
i feel like i have done three life sentences with @entity5 ’			0
the judge said : ‘ by the end of her life , and certainly from the time she was diagnosed with cancer , mrs @entity7 had a deep - rooted and unhealthy gambling habit			1
‘ she was very unwell			0
the evidence satisfies me that she was unkind to those around her , including mrs day			0
she was manipulative with her relatives and many of her friends			0
’ judge @entity64 said mrs @entity7 had tried to pressure and manipulate her daughter into giving her back the flat but mrs day had a ‘ feisty ’ determination to hold on to the property			1
mrs day ( right , outside court this week ) ' stepped out ' with sir @entity6 ( left ) when she was in her 20s and previously gave an interview to a magazine which ' dealt ' with their relationship			0

@entity5 , 45 , was disinherited by her mother @entity7 in her will
when she died in 2013 everything was left to her brother @entity12

banker brother claimed it was part of mother 's estate and should be his
mrs @entity7 had ' *extreme* gambling habit ' and went to casinos every day
