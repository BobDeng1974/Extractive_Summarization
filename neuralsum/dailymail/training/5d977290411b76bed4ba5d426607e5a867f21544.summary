the lawyer wife of movie star @entity1 is set to represent fourteen @entity3 men who claim they were tortured by the @entity4			1
@entity5 has joined the legal team representing the victims - known as the ' @entity8 ' - who were subjected to horrific treatment , including being deprived of sleep , food and water for days			1
@entity1 , a 37 - year - old international law and human rights specialist , will represent the men at the @entity17 in @entity18 as they seek to have their treatment acknowledged as torture			1
distinguished : @entity5 will join the legal team set to represent 14 @entity3 men who claim they were subjected to torture methods by the @entity24 in the 1970s newly married : @entity25 , 37 , with her movie star husband @entity26			1
she has enjoyed a distinguished career as an international law and human rights specialist the men were imprisoned under the @entity35 government 's internment programme in august 1971 , when more than 340 men were rounded up across @entity37			1
they were then selected for ' deep interrogation ' at a specially - built centre at a @entity4 camp , and subjected to ' five techniques ' of torture , which included hooding , being made to stand in prolonged stress positions , white noise , sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink			1
on their way to the interrogation centre in 1971 , some of the men were hooded and thrown to the ground from helicopters			1
they had been told they were hundreds of feet in the air , but in fact they were just a few feet from the ground			2
none of the men were ever convicted of any offence			1
in 1976 , the @entity63 ruled that the @entity35 government was guilty of torture , inhumane and degrading treatment			2
the case was then referred to the @entity17 , which ruled in 1978 that while the five techniques amounted to ' inhumane and degrading treatment ' , they did not constitute torture			2
victims : @entity72 , executive director of @entity74 @entity73 , ( front right ) with a number of the surviving victims			0
they became known as the ' @entity8 ' after revealing details of their treatment but the case will now be reopened after declassified documents were discovered in the @entity35 national archives last year that revealed that the @entity35 government had withheld crucial evidence from the @entity17 during the original hearing			2
the files show that the @entity35 government considered the ' special treatment ' as torture and yet senior ministers still sanctioned its use in @entity37 - both claims they had denied before the @entity17			0
the @entity93 has consistently rejected allegations that it used torture			0
venue : the @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity97 , where the men will take their case there was controversy last year when it was revealed that some @entity104 prisoners were afforded pardons while the @entity106 was being negotiated			1
the government scheme applied to people wanted for paramilitary crimes committed before the @entity106 was signed in 1998			0
necessary : former pm @entity110 , who described the ' on the runs ' scheme as fundamental to the @entity37 @entity113 recently , then prime minister @entity110 said the peace process in @entity37 would probably have collapsed without the ' on the @entity112 ' scheme for fugitive @entity104 members			1
his @entity118 government sent about 200 letters to republicans assuring them they were not being pursued by the @entity35 authorities for historical crimes			0
last month , mr @entity110 told mps investigating the scheme : ' the issue of on the runs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it			0
' the scheme has been in the spotlight after an investigation was launched when the prosecution of a man for the murder of four soldiers in a bombing in @entity137 in 1982 was halted after he received one of the letters in error			0
a review last year into the scheme by @entity144 's review was ordered by prime minister @entity145			2
the review found the scheme had ' significant systemic failures ' in how it operated , but ruled it was lawful			0
@entity144 's report found the administrative scheme was kept ' below the radar ' due to its political sensitivity , but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as ' secret '			0
she added : ' if there was a lack of clarity and openness , responsibility lies with the @entity35 government			0
