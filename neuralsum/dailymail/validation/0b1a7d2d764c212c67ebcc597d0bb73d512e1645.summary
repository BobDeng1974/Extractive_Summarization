appalled : @entity0 said he was shocked by @entity1 , and prepared to tear it apart and start over @entity3 attorney general @entity0 has threatened to dismantle @entity5 's police department to force through reforms after a damning report found widespread racism in the force			1
@entity0 told reporters that the @entity11 is ' prepared to use all the power that we have ' to push through change in the beleaguered @entity16 force , which was castigated nationwide over the killing of @entity18			1
the threat follows the publication of a report which showed officers swapping racist emails , as well as finding that 93 per cent of all arrests in the town , and most uses of excessive force were directed at the @entity29 population			1
president @entity30 has called the policing in @entity5 ' broken and racially biased ' which requires a ' fix ' from the federal government			2
@entity0 , speaking today in @entity35 in front of @entity37 , told reporters that @entity11 plans include ' everything from working with them to coming up with an entirely new structure '			2
when asked if that meant dismantling the force and starting over , he said : ' if that 's what 's necessary , we 're prepared to do that			0
' he seized in particular on parts of the report showing that @entity5 police overwhelmingly issued fines for offenses like traffic violations and speeding to @entity29 - seemingly in an attempt to bolster the city 's revenues			1
' and that is not something that we 're going to tolerate			0
' however , @entity5 's mayor countered @entity0 's threats with a warning that some measures would be an ' overreach ' of executive power , and insisting that the city would not comply unless there was ' mutual satisfaction '			2

the incident triggered months of protest and a national debate about race and police behavior			0
@entity0 also said president @entity30 's task force on policing will issue guidelines to address jailing citizens who owe money to the city , a practice used in @entity5			1
but he noted that the federal government does not have the authority to demand such a change of local governments			0
unrest : protesters like those above brought anarchy to the streets of @entity5 after a grand jury decided to take no action against @entity104 @entity140 officials will meet with the @entity11 in about two weeks to begin negotiating an agreement on reforms , @entity5 mayor @entity138 said			2
if the two parties can not reach a consensus , the @entity11 can sue and force reform			0
@entity138 said on friday that the city would not settle with the @entity11 if the negotiations do not lead to ' mutual satisfaction '			0
' there are a lot of things in that report that are very troubling and need to be addressed , but there are also things that are an overreach , ' @entity138 said .			0
