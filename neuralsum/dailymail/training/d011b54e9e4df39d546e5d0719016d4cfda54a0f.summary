by @entity0 published : 17:50 est , 6 april 2012 updated : 17:50 est , 6 april 2012 @entity1 wants a new trial @entity1 , the @entity3 man who murdered his @entity5 wife and baby daughter , is demanding a new trial on the grounds that a police search of their family home was illegal			1
he also claims the jury which convicted him was biased			2
the @entity13 computer engineer was jailed for life without parole over the 2006 double killing , but his lawyers yesterday ( @entity18 ) told the @entity20 supreme court in @entity21 that much of the crucial evidence heard at his trial was unlawfully obtained and should be thrown out			1
@entity1 , a computer engineer from @entity25 , @entity13 , was convicted of shooting @entity1 , 27 , and nine - month - old @entity26 as they slept in bed in the family ’s rented home in @entity31 , @entity20			1
he later fled to the @entity3 but , alerted by his wife ’s worried mother and friends who could not reach her , police twice searched the house			1
on the second search , they discovered both bodies lying hidden under blankets in the couple ’s bed			0
@entity1 , now 33 , was not present at yesterday ’s 40 - minute hearing at which his wife ’s family listened intently to the evidence but left without comment			1
his lawyer , @entity48 , said police should have obtained a search warrant before entering the house a second time			1
although legal experts believe @entity56 may have a strong case , the judges hearing the appeal appeared sceptical			0
“ two people are missing			0
what is n’t an emergency about that ? ” , said justice @entity58			0
@entity56 with his wife @entity64 , 27 , and their nine - month - old daughter @entity65			1
he is convicted of shooting them in a double murder mr @entity48 acknowledged the bodies would eventually have been discovered but claimed the judges risked allowing police to violate the @entity5 @entity72 ’s ban on “ unreasonable ” searches of a citizen ’s home			1
the lawyer also argued that jurors at @entity1 ’s trial should have been questioned far more rigorously as to whether they were influenced by the huge pre-trial publicity over the case			0
prosecutors told the hearing that the jury was properly vetted by the trial judge , @entity84 , and that police had acted properly when they went into the @entity86 ’ home			2
police are allowed to enter a home without a warrant if they have an “ objectively reasonable basis ’ ’ to believe there may be someone inside who is injured or in immediate danger , said law expert @entity96			2
prof @entity96 said there “ is a very compelling argument that this was an illegal search ”			0
@entity56 pictured in 2006 , police have defended their actions and said they are allowed to enter a home on and ' objectively reasonable basis ' @entity1 ’s trial heard how he was unemployed , heavily in debt and lying to his wife about his job prospects while secretly looking for extra-marital sex on the internet			1
he claimed he panicked after finding the bodies and flew to @entity3 without alerting the police because he wanted to be with his parents			2
they continue to insist he is innocent and that @entity1 was the true killer			0
in 2008 , prison sources said @entity1 had been tricked into shaving his head after a white supremacist skinhead gang said it would protect him after he received threats from other inmates			0
but the gang then admitted it was a prank that would not guarantee his safety , adding : “ we ’re gon na kill you , too			0
” prison officials admitted the threats against @entity56 were serious and have transferred him to a prison with less dangerous inmates .			0

the @entity13 computer engineer was jailed for life without parole in 2006
he was convicted of killing wife @entity64 and their nine - month - old @entity26
police *raided* the home twice and the second time they found both bodies
