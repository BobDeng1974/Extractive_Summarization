by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 ’s personal ratings are worse than those of @entity6 and he has ‘ nothing to say ’ about the issues voters care about such as immigration and welfare , senior @entity2 are warning			1
mr @entity4 is facing mounting unrest over an alleged ’ 35 per cent strategy ’ , which aims to deliver victory thanks to the votes of disaffected @entity17 and @entity18 boundaries which favour @entity20			1
one unnamed ‘ senior party staffer ’ was yesterday said to have declared of @entity20 ’s vanishing poll lead : ‘ if we draw we still win			1
’ @entity4 's ratings are worse than those of @entity6 and he has ' nothing to say ' on key issues , senior @entity2 are warning @entity20 jitters over its prospects at next year ’s general election have been increased by two polls showing they have fallen behind the conservatives for the first time for more than two years			1
mr @entity4 yesterday sought to dismiss questions about his suitability to lead , insisting that he and his party were focusing ‘ on the issues the country is facing ’			1
‘ the cost of living crisis , how we create good jobs with good wages in this country , including with successful @entity48 industry , how we improve the @entity49 - that 's where @entity20 's focus is and that 's where it will remain , ’ he insisted			1
but he is being confronted with calls to toughen his messages on areas including immigration and welfare , where the @entity34 are seen as having outflanked @entity20			2
one former @entity20 minister told the @entity58 : ‘ @entity4 is comfortable talking about how bad business is and rent controls and the bedroom tax			1
‘ he has got nothing to say about the issues that public is concerned about			0
he does n’t talk about immigration			0
he does n’t talk about welfare			0
we ’re about to go into a national election [ for the @entity67 parliament ] under his leadership and we are not going to win it			0
‘ it ’s not inconceivable that we could end up coming third			2
mps are in a tailspin			0
plenty of them are panicking			0
‘ @entity4 has had four years and has n’t managed to shift his personal ratings and public perception of him one iota			0
his numbers are catastrophic – worse than @entity79 [ @entity79 ] or @entity6			0
no - one has ever gone on to win an election with ratings as bad as this			0
’ the latest @entity85 poll puts @entity20 on just 31 per cent , the lowest level of support for an opposition party a year out from a general election it is the first time the @entity91 have been ahead in the polls since before the disastrous ' omnishambles ' budget in 2012 @entity20 mp @entity95 said the two opinion polls showing the @entity91 back in the lead should serve as a ‘ wake - up call ’			1
‘ we ’ve got some good policies - the energy price freeze , house - building , the jobs guarantee , cutting gp waiting times , helping those in the private rented sector - but we need to make sure people understand what they are , ’ he said			2
‘ we have to make sure people understand what a @entity20 government will do for them			1
and we need people to believe what we are telling them			0
’ mr @entity95 said @entity20 needed a strong economic message that it should ‘ get out there in a clearer and sharper way ’			1
‘ if we are to draw any positives from this , it ’s good that its happened in 2014 , twelve months before the election			1
one could argue the @entity91 are peaking too soon and we have time to get things moving in the right direction so it ’s still all to play for			0
’ @entity20 's jitters over its prospects at next year 's general election have grown , after two polls showed it had fallen behind the @entity91 for the first time in more than two years			1
but mr @entity4 yesterday insisted he and his party were focusing on ' the issues the country is facing ' @entity132 , editor of the unofficial party website @entity134 , said : ‘ no - one can say that this has n’t been coming through			0
@entity20 ’s poll share has fallen from the relative comfort of the low forties and the high thirties to the uncomfortable territory of the mid-thirties , and now downwards into the low thirties – nearing the @entity6 zone			1
‘ if these dreadful polls achieve anything , i hope it ’s to shake the party – politicians , staff and activists alike – out of the torpor which appears to have overcome it			2
two years of poll leads have led to drift , a lack of energy and a deficit of imagination			0
these polls show that @entity20 can not coast to victory – in fact , they show that defeat , and a painfully crushing one , is possible			1
’ mr @entity132 attacked the ‘ keep calm and carry on brigade ’ who ‘ note without concern that @entity20 could still have the most seats with only 32 per cent of the vote and a two - point @entity34 lead ’			1
he claimed one ‘ senior party staffer ’ had recently told him : ‘ if we draw we still win ’			2
mr @entity132 condemned that attitude as ‘ complacent beyond belief ’			2
conservative chairman @entity174 said : ‘ @entity4 ’s calculated political gimmicks all show the same thing			2
they would crash our economy all over again , because they still want the high spending , borrowing and taxes that brought @entity48 to its knees			0
” ‘ it is only by sticking with @entity183 and the government ’s long - term economic plan that we can ensure a more secure future for @entity48 , and for our children			2
’ a spokesman for mr @entity4 said : ‘ this is a four - party dynamic			2
we have been talking about welfare and immigration and we will have more to say about @entity194 and the reforms we want to see in @entity67			0
‘ a 35 per cent strategy never existed			1
i have never heard anybody mention it			0
we want to win as many votes as possible			0
