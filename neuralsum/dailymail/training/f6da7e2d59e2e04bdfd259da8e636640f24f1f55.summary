@entity6 's fisheries agency said its programme was being conducted ' in line with a research plan submitted to the @entity70 ' @entity20 , captain of the @entity20 ship @entity149 , said @entity6 had shown ' flagrant disregard for international law ' by continuing whaling ' there is nothing scientific about this , it is butchery , ' dr @entity18 said			1
