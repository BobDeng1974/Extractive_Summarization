' the company changed its ' @entity7 ' line of @entity9 chips to be called ' simply , ' although the ingredients remain the same			1
similarly , its ' @entity11 ' got a makeover as ' simply @entity11			0
' the food and beverage giant says the name changes , which took place last year , are the result of it updating its marketing			0
but they come at a time when @entity1 and other companies face legal challenges over their use of the word ' natural			0
' re-brand : @entity1 has quietly gotten rid of the word natural in some of its products and instead is going with simply simple enough : is there anything natural about these harvest bars ? the @entity31 does n't have a definition for what constitutes ' natural , ' but says it does n't object to the word 's use as long as the product does n't contain ' added color , artificial flavors or synthetic substances			1
' still , a number of lawsuits recently have challenged whether the ingredients in products labeled as ' natural ' fit that billing			1
in some cases , companies are realizing the use of ' natural ' is n't worth the headache , said @entity49 , director of litigation for the consumer advocacy group @entity51 , an advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against companies on the topic			1
last year , @entity1 agreed to remove the words ' all natural ' from its naked juices after a lawsuit noted the drinks contained artificial ingredients , such as a fiber made by @entity63			1
another ongoing lawsuit filed in 2012 has challenged its description of some of its chips as ' natural			2
' and in november , @entity1 killed off its @entity71 line , saying the drinks did n't ' resonate ' with its core consumers			0
all change : last year , @entity1 agreed to remove the words ' all natural ' from its naked juices after a lawsuit noted the drinks contained artificial ingredients same stuff in the box , different name : the company changed its simply natural line of @entity9 chips to simply be called simply , although the ingredients remain the same			1
similarly , its @entity87 got a makeover as simply @entity11 natural no more : @entity1 killed off its @entity71 line , saying the drinks did n't ' resonate ' with its core consumers ' we constantly update our marketing and packaging , ' said @entity95 , a spokeswoman for @entity1 's @entity11 brand			1
@entity1 is n't alone in retreating from ' natural			2
' the owners of @entity99 's and @entity101 ice cream agreed to change its packaging in 2012 to settle lawsuits over its use of ' all natural			2
' @entity107 was sued in 2012 for describing its @entity109 crackers as natural , with the suit noting they contain genetically modified ingredients			2
the @entity114 , @entity115 - based company removed the word from its revamped packaging , but said it was the result of marketing changes and declined to comment any further on the change			0
the word ' simply ' is n't entirely free of controversy either			0
although it did n't file a lawsuit , the @entity51 met with @entity123 in 2010 over labeling on a variety of the company 's products			0
among those singled out was ' @entity128 , ' which the group noted contained canola oil and carrot juice â € ” not just fruit			0
when asked if it had a response to the @entity51 's complaint that the name was misleading , a @entity123 spokesman @entity133 said in an email , ' yes , we do have a response : it is n't			0

@entity144 products that were branded ' simply natural ' are now called ' simply '
the @entity31 does n't specify what is ' natural ' - but anything that has added color , flavors or substances is not natural !
a number of lawsuits have challenged whether ingredients that are labeled as ' natural ' should be given such titles
