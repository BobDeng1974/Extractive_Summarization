when it comes to being healthy , the world ’s priority is getting more sleep rather than eating healthy food , exercising or taking vitamins , a poll has found			1
@entity7 , 66 per cent of people get enough sleep , compared to 59 per cent who eat healthy food and 57 per cent who regularly exercise			2
@entity13 and @entity14 are the most well - rested , with 85 and 77 per cent respectively reporting they get enough sleep			2
meanwhile the @entity16 and @entity17 get by with the least shut - eye , with only 51 per cent and 52 per cent getting enough rest to maintain health			2
the poll , by market research organisation @entity21 , questioned more than 28,000 in 23 countries on which activities they regularly do to maintain their physical health			0
graphic shows the percentage of people in each country ( arranged alphabetically , going from @entity31 , clockwise , to the @entity32 ) who get enough sleep ( red ) , eat healthy food ( green ) or exercise ( blue )			1
these were the top activities people worldwide report they carry out to maintain physical health globally , people focus more on sleep than on regular oral care , and more on exercise than spending time with friends , family or pets			1
the graph shows the top five activities people around the world say they carry out in order to maintain their physical health			1
it also breaks down each category by gender , showing more women take part in health promoting behaviours than men - except when it comes to exercise it found only that while sushi may be touted as a diet option , only 29 per cent of people in @entity59 say they eat healthy food			1
and while curry is billed as a high - calorie friday night treat , 79 per cent of people in @entity14 say they eat healthily			1
@entity66 and @entity67 have the highest number of people who exercise on a regular basis ( 68 per cent and 67 per cent ) , while @entity59 and @entity17 have fewer fitness fanatics ( 39 per cent and 40 per cent )			2
for the survey , @entity21 interviewed people aged 15 or older in 23 countries either online or face - to - face in summer 2014			0
the countries included @entity31 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity67 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity14 , @entity13 , @entity83 , @entity59 , @entity66 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity32			1
they were asked which activity they were most likely to carry out in order to maintain their physical health , from a list of 14 activities from sleep and exercise to unplugging from technology and meditating			1
their questioning revealed having a cosmetic procedure - whether surgical or non-surgical - was the least popular way of maintaining health , with only 6 per cent of people globally choosing to do this			0
the study found stark differences between the sexes , especially when it comes to sun safety			0
globally , women are over twice as likely than men to use sunscreen than men , it found			0
people in @entity79 slather on the most suncream , at 46 per cent , while @entity77 and @entity86 both trail at 42 per cent			0
and having children seems to make people more healthy			0
parents get 2 per cent more sleep than non-parents and lead on eating healthy food by 8 per cent			2
you might think running around after children would put parents in the lead on exercise , but in fact non-parents edged in front by 3 per cent			0
graph shows , from top to bottom , the activities the majority of people worldwide carried out to maintain their physical health			1
sleep and eating healthily topped the list , while using herbal , holistic or alternative remedies , massages or spa treatments or undergoing a cosmetic procedure were bottom of the list the activities people in the @entity89 said they carried out to be healthy ( light blue ) compared to the global average ( dark blue )			1
more people in the @entity89 used skin care , beauty or personal grooming products than the global average ( 44 per cent compared with 38 per cent ) but @entity89 are less likely to use meditation or relaxation techniques than the global average ( 9 per cent compared with 17 per cent ) the activities people in the @entity32 said they carried out to be healthy ( light blue ) compared to the global average ( dark blue )			2
in the @entity32 , spending time with family and friends topped the list of health - promoting activities , with a whopping 71 per cent carrying out this activity , compared to a global average of 53 per cent			2
but @entity32 lagged behind the worldwide average when it comes to following a specific diet ( 17 per cent compared with 18 per cent ) the activities people in the @entity77 said they carried out to be healthy ( light blue ) compared to the global average ( dark blue )			1
more @entity77 took vitamins and supplements than the global average ( 45 per cent compared to 32 per cent ) but they were not so prolific in getting massages or spa treatments ( 12 per cent compared to a global average of 14 per cent ) there will be differences across countries in what people think of as being ' healthy , nutritious food ' , a @entity21 analyst said @entity66 topped the global list for exercise , but are they really the fittest ? a spokesperson for @entity21 explained that cultural differences could explain the results ... he told @entity197 : ' the study reports what people are consciously doing regularly to maintain their physical health , so the findings reflect not only what activities people are doing , but also what activities they associate with being specifically for physical health			1
' there is also the question of cultural background – for example , the normal level of work - life balance within each country will impact amount of sleep and perceptions of how much sleep is necessary for physical health			0
' there will also be differences across countries in exactly what people think of as being ‘ exercise ’ or ‘ healthy , nutritious food ’			0
' for example – @entity66 is known as having a growing level of obesity since the 1980s , but it also reports the highest number of consumers who claim to exercise on a regular basis to maintain their physical health			0
' an explanation for this is not necessarily that @entity66 is full of hard - core gym fanatics ; it ’s more likely to be that health focus has gone from widespread malnutrition before 1980s to growing levels of obesity now , so this is very much in the national focus and higher levels of the population have this issue " front of mind "			0
' they will therefore be more broadly aware than other countries of the need for exercise and are therefore likely to assign lower levels of activity ( e.g. walking to the shops ) into the category of ‘ exercising ’ than , for example , populations in @entity89 or @entity82 who might only assign going to the gym or playing sport as ‘ exercising ’			0
