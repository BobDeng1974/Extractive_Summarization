@entity1 senator @entity0 has revealed @entity2 is partly responsible for her new look , describing the wrinkle - smoothing procedure as ' addictive '			1
the former @entity6 member has also spoken out about being single and has again hit out prime minister @entity7 , saying he needs to ' grow a pair '			1
the article , which features in january 's issue of @entity11 , is accompanied by pictures of senator @entity0 's promised new look , with her signature pulled - back bun replaced with loose tresses			1

it 's like " @entity35 , here comes that wrinkle again " , ' she said			2

the @entity11 article is accompanied by pictures of senator @entity0 's promised new look , with her signature pulled - back bun replaced with loose tresses ' i basically have n't been with anyone for 10 or 11 years , ' she said			1
' i 'm open to it			2
it 's just to have that human contact would be nice			0
' ms @entity0 had two children by the time she was 27 years old			2
she became pregnant at 18 with @entity53 and was with child while she trained for the army , which meant five - kilometre runs and 100 push - ups up until she reached the 20 - week mark			0
her second child , @entity59 , was a result of a relationship with fellow soldier @entity62 at 22			0
they separated after years together as senator @entity0 does not believe in ' staying together for the sake of the kids ' as it was ' a coward 's way '			1
after this relationship break - up , her career with the army stalled due to an ongoing back injury during training			0
here @entity0 in happier times with @entity6 leader and @entity77 mining magnate @entity78 to try and reduce the burden on her back , the army contributed funds to reduce senator @entity0 's double - d breasts after having two children , which she says ' were hanging down '			1

the drugs she took for her back pain , similar to those prescribed to schizophrenics which ' messes with the chemicals in your brain ' , led her to be cared for by her son , @entity59			0

' i began thinking " what use am i to anyone ? i might as well end it			0
i 'm a waste of space " , ' she said			0
this is the point where @entity111 attempted to take her own life when she was drunk and walked in front of a car			0
senator @entity0 says @entity7 ' does n't wear the pants ' in his office but chief of staff @entity117 does having spent 20 years working on her depression , the mother - of - two turned to politics and the @entity29 senator catapulted herself into the spotlight with her frank - and sometimes shocking - opinions			1
most infamously describing her ideal man as one with ' heaps of cash ' and had ' a package between their legs ' , and her position on banning the burqa , which has landed her in hot water			0
but the final straw for @entity6 leader @entity78 was when senator @entity0 said she would vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal was reconsidered			1
despite being very vocal about her opinions of her former boss in the past , this time senator @entity0 only had tough words for prime minister @entity7 who she says has to ' grow a pair '			1
' females scare the crap out of him but he 's going to have to grow a pair because he has to deal with me , ' she said			2
' my vote 's important so if i was @entity7 , i 'd be saying " hey , @entity0 , let 's have a cup of coffee "			2
' but he ca n't do that , can he ? because he does n't wear the pants			0
