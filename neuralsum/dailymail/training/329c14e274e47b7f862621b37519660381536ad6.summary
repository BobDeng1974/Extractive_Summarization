by @entity0 @entity1 has written to all schools and colleges in @entity4 warning them to watch out for signs of radicalisation and other forms of child abuse @entity1 has written to all schools and colleges in @entity4 urging them to watch out for signs of radicalisation in the wake of the so - called @entity15 plot			1
in a letter to headteachers , the @entity16 said schools and colleges must be aware of any type of child abuse			1
he said this included radicalisation as well as cyberbullying , sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation			0
the @entity29 advice included links to existing guidance from a variety of organisations			0
one of those was channel - part of a government strategy to protect people at risk of being radicalised			0
the information said those at risk might possess ' material or symbols associated with an extremist cause ( e.g. the swastika for far right groups ) '			1
it added they ' spend increasing time in the company of other suspected extremists ' or attempt to recruit others to their cause			0
the advice suggests a change in appearance or clothing as well as a loss of interest in friends may also be clues of radicalisation			0
the document said : ' channel is about protecting people from radicalisation into all forms of terrorism , but the most significant threat to this country is from @entity69 affiliated , influenced and associated groups			1
' the advice comes as @entity72 of @entity73 claimed schools across @entity75 have been targeted in the alleged @entity15 plot			1
the plot involves the alleged ousting of headteachers , mainly in and around the @entity81 area , by @entity83 extremists attempting to take over several top schools in a bid to target vulnerable young people			1
the @entity87 in @entity81 - which , according to whistleblowers , has been infiltrated by @entity83 extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people last week , association members said they had ‘ serious concerns ’ about attempts to ‘ alter the character ’ of at least six schools - before warning efforts had been made to infiltrate a number of classrooms across the country			1
at least 20 schools are currently being investigated in wake of the claims			1
the so - called @entity15 plot first came to light earlier this year			1
@entity106 inspectors were ordered into @entity87 in @entity81 along with its sister schools , @entity108 and @entity109 , after a letter dubbed ' @entity15 ' was uncovered			1
it allegedly outlined a plot by @entity83 hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools			1
whistleblowers at @entity117 have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body			0
it is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and @entity129 pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school			1
the letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) and @entity134 in to the school and several others in the area			0
the @entity106 has also appointed its own education commissioner , the former head of the @entity141 ’s counter-terrorism unit @entity139 for the investigation			0
following the allegations , the school was placed in to special measures			0
another 21 are thought to be under investigation by schools watchdog @entity134			2
@entity148 is also investigating 25 schools			2
last week @entity150 said it had ‘ serious concerns ’ about attempts to ‘ alter the character ’ of at least six schools - warning the ' plot ' was spreading across the country			1
two teachers in @entity158 have since left their jobs - with a third claiming their are being forced out - in the latest twist to the story			0
the @entity106 's newly updated advice said everyone working in a school or college should be aware of the signs of abuse and neglect ' so that they are able to identify cases of children who may be in need of help or protection ' and can take action			2
today , mr @entity1 wrote : ' the guidance reiterates that staff members working with children should always think ‘ it could happen here ’ where safeguarding is concerned			0
' school and college staff are particularly important as they are in a position to identify concerns early and provide help for children , to prevent concerns from escalating			0
' in a specific section on female genital mutilation ( @entity192 ) it said that all professionals needed to be ' alert to the possibility of a girl being at risk of @entity192 , or already having suffered @entity192 '			0
it added that girls at risk of the practice may not know they were in danger			0
the so - called ' @entity15 ’ plot is the alleged takeover in secular schools by @entity83 extremists			1
some claim they are attempting to infiltrate state schools and run them according to @entity83 principles			2
one of the most high - profile schools involved in the claims , @entity210 in @entity81 , has been condemned for increasing ‘ @entity213 ’			2
it is claimed the school has hosted extremist preachers during assemblies and encouraged girls to cover their hair			2
the school was recently subject to an emergency investigation by schools watchdog @entity134 and was put in to special measures			2
at the end of last month , a list of 18 schools under investigation in and around @entity81 was released			2
last week , @entity134 announced inspections were investigating a further three schools , bringing the total to 21 .			0

@entity16 has written to all schools and colleges in @entity4
