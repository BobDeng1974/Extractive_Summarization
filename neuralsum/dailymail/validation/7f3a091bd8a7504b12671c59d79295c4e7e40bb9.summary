there are few @entity2 sportspeople who have legitimate claims to being the best in the world in their field			2
in golden girls @entity8 and @entity9 we have two who are likely to be battling for top billing over the next two years			1
@entity2 athletics performance director @entity12 is not guilty of hyperbole when he claims their anticipated duels in the heptathlon , notably at the @entity17 in @entity18 this summer and the @entity19 in @entity20 in 2016 represent a ‘ magical time ’ for the sport			1
@entity8 , 22 , has risen to being the world ’s number one in the absence of @entity26 , who took a break to have baby son , @entity28			1
the pair ’s first competitive meeting since 2012 , at the hypo - meeting in @entity32 , @entity33 at the end of may promises to be one of the most gripping sporting duels of the year			0
@entity8 ( far left ) and @entity9 ( centre ) , pictured with @entity38 at @entity39 , have been praised by @entity40 performance director @entity12 @entity8 is expected to battle it out with @entity26 for top billing over the next few years @entity26 took some time out of athletics following the birth of her baby son , @entity28 @entity8 ’s first major gold medal in the pentathlon at the @entity49 in @entity50 on friday , where she missed out on the @entity51 by just 13 points , was the realisation of an incredible talent			1
as a teenager she beat @entity26 ’s junior records and is now seeing her own being broken by 17 - year - old @entity57			1
‘ i just think its an amazing set of circumstances , ’ said @entity12 , ‘ i ’m sure it ’s partly coincidental and partly as a result of all the stimulus dating back many years , the , striving to beat each other and role models and so on			2
but to think that they are all going to be hopefully in @entity32 and they ’re all hopefully going to be at the @entity17 in @entity18 in august and the @entity19 next year , its just a kind of magical time			0
' and what comes from it is just going to be spectacular			0
i ca n’t see that you can get much more exciting than that in any sport this summer			0
you have three incredibly capable , high performing , lovely personalities , with great teams around them , brilliant coaches , all vying for medals in competitions			0
’ @entity12 insists the 2016 @entity19 in @entity20 present a ‘ magical time ’ for the sport @entity26 and her coach @entity85 have been tight lipped about how her training at the @entity88 in @entity89 is going but she has posted pictures of herself on @entity91 and she looks to be in supreme shape			1
‘ all the feedback that we ’ve had is that her progression is great , ’ said @entity12 , ‘ @entity98 ( @entity40 head of combined events ) is regularly there , meeting with @entity101 , @entity85 , and the javelin sessions , the biomechanical support , they ’re all working together and it ’s going well			2
’ @entity12 also backed sprinter @entity104 - who added the @entity106 gold to the @entity107 he won last year - to join the sub- 10sec club over 100m			2
‘ he ’s re-established himself as a serious sprinting candidate			0
of course he was frustrated not to have cemented that at the same level outdoors and i ’m sure that will be his target and that ’s what we ’re looking for going into the @entity17			0

@entity12 has praised @entity9 and @entity8
@entity8 has risen world no 1 position in @entity26 *'s* absence
@entity26 took a break to have baby son , @entity28 in july 2014
