the cat ’s out of the bag : truth and lies about cats by @entity5 within his satirical lexicon @entity10 , the 19th - century @entity8 satirist @entity7 impertinently defined a cat as ‘ a soft , indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle ’			1
this outrageous calumny , evidently the work of a dog - lover , appears in a new celebration of feline trivia and folklore gathered by @entity5			1
in his introduction , @entity5 writes that it takes a while for cats to train humans to provide for their needs and not expect anything in return			1
anyone who has ever become a willing slave to an exigent feline will know exactly what he means			1
the innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language but perhaps it is n’t quite fair to say that cats offer nothing in exchange for the food , warmth and adoration bestowed on them by their besotted owners			1
dogs may claim the title of man ’s best friend , but anyone who has lived with a cat knows they are simply too cool to want to be friends with humans			2
people who love cats find their aloofness captivating and their beauty irresistible			2
the most battle - scarred old moggy , prowling the garden wall in search of a fight , moves with the instinctive grace of a tiger			0
and it is no accident that cats , rather than any other creature , were considered sacred by the @entity69			2
there is an enigmatic quality to the feline bearing that no dog could hope to emulate			2
the innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language , literature , movies and even music			1
( if you have never heard @entity83 ’s @entity82 , as sung by @entity84 and @entity85 , check out the blissfully funny @entity87 video of them performing it at the @entity90			0
) true to their insinuating nature , cats turn up in the most unexpected of places			2
there are none in the @entity96 ( though dogs , cattle , donkeys , lions , horses and chickens all feature in scripture )			0
but @entity105 ’s works include 42 mentions of cats , and not all of them entirely complimentary			2
among the most beloved of literary cats are the benevolently grinning @entity110 from @entity111 ; @entity112 , the fictional alley cat whose adventures with her best friend , a cockroach called @entity117 , were the subject of a series of newspaper columns by the @entity8 journalist @entity121 ; and @entity122 , the devastatingly eloquent feline hero of a comic short story by the @entity126 writer @entity125			1
literary - minded cat - lovers cherish @entity128 , whose boldly striped cat @entity130 appears in many of his illustrated nonsense rhymes , while @entity134 ’s books for children contain some vividly characterful cats , including the distracted single mother @entity137 and her wayward son , @entity139			1
in film , cats prove unexpectedly willing to take direction			0
movies with feline stars include the @entity146 films , in which the villian , @entity148 , is often shown stroking his pet , a blue - eyed white @entity150 ; breakfast at @entity154 , in which a marmalade cat known only as @entity110 starred alongside @entity157 ’s @entity156 ; and the @entity158 ’ 2013 film @entity151 , in which a ginger tom stole the limelight from @entity162 and @entity163			1
and when it comes to conflict , cats have proved themselves to be intrepid comrades			0
wing commander @entity168 , who led the @entity172 raid , took his his cat , @entity174 , with him on so many flights that it gained more flying hours than many human pilots			0
another wartime cat , @entity179 — an undernourished , dockyard kitten — was smuggled aboard @entity181 in 1948 by 17 - year - old ordinary seaman @entity182			0
adored by the ship ’s crew for his vigorous rat - catching and sense of humour ( he used to leave dead rats in the sailors ’ beds ) , he was given the rank of @entity179 , and was wounded in action during the @entity193 , when the ship was fired on by @entity196 gun batteries			0
@entity179 was awarded the @entity197 in august 1949 and died of an infection later that year			0
the entire crew of @entity181 attended his funeral at the @entity201			0
stories such as this bring tears to the eyes of soppy cat owners ( of whom i am one )			0
but before we get too sentimental , @entity5 ’s richly enjoyable anthology reminds us of the saying by that prolific coiner of aphorisms , @entity214 : ‘ a cat knows your every thought , but does n’t care			1

@entity5 *'s* new book is a celebration of feline trivia and folklore
the mysteriousness of cats has spawned many cultural references
@entity5 reminds us that : ‘ a cat knows your every thought , but does n’t care . ’
