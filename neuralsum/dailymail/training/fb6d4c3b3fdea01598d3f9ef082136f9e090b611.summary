by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 12:19 est , 7 january 2014 scientists believe studying the bones of the @entity4 could give clues about the abnormal cell growth that causes cancer studying the @entity4 ’s bones could give clues about the causes of cancer , experts believe			1
scientists think his skeleton could shed light on abnormal cell growth and its causes			0
this could reveal why cells start to grow out of control causing tumours			1
previously , attempts to study the bones of the @entity4 , whose real name was @entity4 , failed			1
this was because @entity24 could not be extracted from the bones as they had been cleaned with bleach			1
however , new techniques have now allowed testing to resume , the @entity29 reports			1
it is hoped this research will finally clear up the mystery of exactly what caused his disfigurement and that it could also give clues about other diseases , such as cancer			0
professor @entity41 , of @entity42 , where the bones are stored , told the @entity29 that the underlying genetic problem responsible for tissue overgrowth in the @entity4 could also reveal clues to how a cell grows , and how it knows when it should stop growing			1
he said : ' while i would n’t predict that @entity4 is sitting on the cure for cancer , it is through studies of this nature that we will have a better understanding of what it is that determines how a cell moves from a normal state , into this abnormal process of disregular cell growth			2
’ @entity4 was born in 1862 in @entity63			2
he began to develop disfiguring tumours before he reached the age of two and his condition deteriorated rapidly			0
it left him unable to work meaning he had to enter a workhouse , but he was so desperate to escape the workhouse that he moved to @entity70 and participated in an act called ' the @entity4 , @entity72 and @entity73 '			2
when public opinion turned against the idea of freak shows , mr @entity4 moved to live at the @entity77			0
he died unexpectedly in 1890 at the age of 27			0
previous attempts to study @entity24 from the bones failed because the skeleton was cleaned with bleach			1
image shows @entity85 's bones being put through a ct scanner it is still not known for sure what caused his disfigurement but it is thought that he had @entity93 syndrome			0
this is a condition which causes the atypical growth of the bones and skin and is more common in men than women			0
its cause is unknown but it can cause gigantism of the limbs , increased organ size , rough skin , tumours and life - threatening blood clots .			0

studying @entity4 's skeleton could reveal why cells sometimes start to grow out of control causing cancerous tumours
previous attempts to study the bones failed because @entity24 could not be extracted from them as they had been cleaned with bleach
new scientific techniques have now allowed testing to resume
