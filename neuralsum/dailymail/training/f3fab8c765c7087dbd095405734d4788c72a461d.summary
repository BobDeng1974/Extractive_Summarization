@entity62 said of her father : ‘ he can communicate but is always very angry due to the brain injuries			1
it ’s changed his personality			0
‘ my mum and dad were very careful people and just because of my experience being with them when they were with me out and about crossing roads , i ca n’t understand how this happened			0
’ mr @entity31 was not able to attend the hearing for health reasons			1
this is the crossing , on @entity92 in @entity11 , @entity13 , where the couple were run over the tragedy occurred on january 16 last year in the village of @entity11 , near @entity12 , @entity13 , at 3pm			1
they were walking across the pedestrian crossing outside shops in the village only to be hit by the @entity17 driver who apparently failed to spot them			1
witness @entity102 who was driving on @entity92 shortly before the 3pm crash told the hearing : ‘ it was a clear day and dry with good visibility			0
however as i continued driving through town i noticed the sun was shining very brightly and was low in the sky			0
‘ i was driving directly into the sunlight and had to put the car ’s visor down but it made no difference			0
soon i could n’t see anything			0
the sun was so bright and so low i found myself looking for the lines on the road			2
i slowed right down because it was frightened me			0
i just could n’t see			0
@entity119 , daughter of @entity9 and @entity10 , said the couple lived in a bungalow minutes from the crossing ‘ i had begun talking to myself , saying , “ i hope no - one is on that crossing ” because i would n’t have been able to see them			1
i stopped before the crossing because i could n’t see if anyone was on it because i could n’t see the crossing			0
‘ the sun was so low and was on the windscreen			0
due to this i actually opened my driver ’s side door and put a leg out to stand up and look at the crossing			2
there was nobody there and it was quiet			0
‘ when i was back in the car i was still barely able to see and almost missed the left turn and nearly hit a bollard			2
‘ i was very upset to hear about this but i was n’t overly surprised			0
i have n’t experience anything as frightening as that day since			0
’ another witness , newsagent @entity140 , said : ‘ i was looking out of the window and to my right i saw a blue @entity17 doing about 30 - 35mph and was about 30ft from the crossing			1
‘ at the same time i noticed an old couple stop on the zebra crossing and they were facing away from me			2
they then went a couple of steps onto the crossing			2
‘ the blue @entity17 was n’t stopping and it hit the man and woman and they flew into the air then the car swerved			1
it came to a stop about 10ft past the crossing			0
‘ the woman who had been hit was a short distance behind the car			0
the man had been thrown forwards			0
i went to help the woman but i ran back to the shop and got a towel for the blood and when i came back a lot of people were around and traffic was backing up			2
‘ the incident happened in a matter of seconds			0
the only thing that would have stopped the driver would have been the sun. she would have been blinded by it			2
’ motorist @entity178 said : ‘ i saw out of the corner of my left eye a shadow fall to the floor			0
it came from the bonnet of a car			0
‘ i saw an old lady lying on her left hand side facing towards me and an old man with his back on the road and a stream of blood running towards the gutter			1
‘ in the stationary blue car there was a lady of about 60 with her head in her hands			2
’ the inquest at @entity200 continues			1
