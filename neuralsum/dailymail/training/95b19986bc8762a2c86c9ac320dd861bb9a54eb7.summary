building on disused industrial sites and empty housing plots could dramatically ease pressure on the countryside , a study has found			1
there is space for more than one million homes on derelict land , vacant plots and disused ground , according to the @entity11			0
and 400,000 of them would be able to be built without delay , because the sites already have planning permission			1
there is space for more than one million homes on derelict land , vacant plots and disused ground , according to the @entity11 campaigners say that using these ' brownfield ' sites would solve @entity20 's housing crisis and help preserve our countyside			1
rural groups have become increasingly unhappy at the ease with which ' predatory developers ' are concreting over our most beautiful countryside for housing developments			1
two of the most respected rural institutions – the @entity31 and @entity32 – have issued warnings in recent weeks that some of @entity20 's most picturesque countryside is being desecrated as a result of the government ' s weakened planning laws			1
and yesterday the @entity39 revealed that one land agent – @entity41 – is so confident it jump legal hurdles that it has offered ' no win , no fee ' deals to farmers to secure planning permission for housing developments on their land			2
@entity32 said in an editorial last week that rural communities have been ' stripped of their natural defences ' by the government 's planning policies , which have opened the floodgates to a wave of greenfield planning applications			2
the policies have also been denounced by sir @entity60 , the chairman of the @entity31 , in a @entity39 article earlier this month			0
separate research conducted by the @entity31 last year found that half of councils are planning to build on green belt land over the next five years			1
planning minister @entity66 ( pictured ) said he welcomed the report the government insists it needs to build 200,000 homes a year in @entity70 to meet the demands of a growing population			1
but the @entity11 argues that if brownfield sites were used for housing , there would be no need to even consider concreting over open fields			1
the report , called from wasted space to @entity81 , also makes a series of recommendations that would make brownfield land more attractive to developers			2
@entity86 , @entity11 planning campaign manager , said : ' this research demonstrates the huge existing capacity for housing on brownfield land			2
' at a time when there is great pressure on our green spaces , utilising this land through a brownfield - first policy would protect our countryside and regenerate urban areas			0
' we want this new , authoritative evidence to lead to a sustained focus on suitable brownfield land			0
we can and must do more to get these sites redeveloped , whether it be reviving the national land use database or implementing strong local plans to deal with multiple landowners on difficult sites			0
' the report , based on an investigation of council records conducted by the @entity112 , found at least 976,000 new homes could be built on identified brownfield sites			1
the true figure could be much higher , because the researchers only identified land already derelict or with planning permission - it does not include underused land such as car parks			0
there is already planning permission for enough land to accommodate more than 400,000 houses - and space for another 550,000 on derelict land			0
nearly half of this vacant space is located in the south east , the east of @entity70 and @entity130 - the areas under the greatest stress			0
the @entity11 called for the government to change its planning policy to prioritise previously developed sites over rural sites			2
it wants the @entity137 to be given greater powers and funding to redevelop large and difficult sites			0
and it called for far more a proactive approach in actively searching for and identifying brownfield land			0
developers have claimed that brownfield sites are often too difficult and expensive to bring back into use			1
the government has promised to change that by reducing red tape and easing planning regulations			0
sir @entity60 , the chairman of the @entity31 , denounced the policies where rural communities have been ' stripped of their natural defences ' by the government 's planning rules they have said they will make it easier to convert warehouses and industrial premises into homes , which they hope will lead to more housing on the edges of towns , reducing the need for building in open countryside			1
the reforms would regenerate high streets by making it easier to change disused shops into restaurants and leisure facilities			0
planning minister @entity66 said last night : ' we welcome this report , which illustrates the scope for building new homes and protecting the countryside at the same time			2
' this government wants to see the maximum amount of brownfield land being used to build new homes , whilst also maintaining protections for our beautiful countryside			1
' that is why our planning reforms encourage councils to use brownfield land for new buildings , free up disused public sector land for redevelopment and why we ' ve invested £ 235 million into bringing 80,000 long term empty homes back into use since 2010			2
' we are proud to be building more homes to support hard working families and help first time buyers onto the property ladder			0

campaigners say using brownfield sites would solve housing crisis
say 400,000 could be built without delay as they have planning permisson
