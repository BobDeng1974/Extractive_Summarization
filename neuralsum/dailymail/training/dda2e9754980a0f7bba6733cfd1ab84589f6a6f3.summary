the decision , which could lead to a trial in the long - running scandal , complicates any political comeback by @entity6 , who has been dogged for years by the ' @entity14 ' in which he denies any misconduct			0
@entity6 is the @entity3 conservative voters ' favourite to take on @entity19 president @entity18 in 2017 after losing to him last year			1
worried : former @entity3 president @entity6 , centre , is pictured leaving @entity22 ' courthouse but he could suffer if he is tried over allegations of exploiting the mental frailty of @entity3 's richest woman			1
' there is more chance of a trial on the horizon for @entity6 , and as for his eventual return to politics , it 's obviously a lot more complicated for him ' political analyst @entity33 told @entity34			0
' he is no longer master of his own calendar			0
' a lawyer for one of the 12 people investigated in the case said the decision would be appealed to the @entity42 , the country 's highest appeals court			1

it was prompted by a challenge mounted in july by lawyers for @entity6 and 11 others placed under investigation			0
they contested a 2011 medical report that determined @entity7 had been suffering from dementia since 2006			1
lawyers argued the formal inquiry could not be viewed as impartial because one of the doctors involved in the report was a friend of the judge who placed @entity6 under investigation , @entity105 - @entity104			1
defeat : @entity6 and his third wife @entity106 leave the @entity107 as current @entity3 president @entity18 and his partner @entity109 look on ' were the ( medical ) expertise to have fallen through , it would have weakened the case and the formal investigation could have caved in ' @entity33 said			1
' in short , the main pillar in the @entity7 case would have collapsed			1
' @entity6 has largely stayed out of the limelight since his defeat to @entity18 last year , but has dropped hints this year that he is mulling a re-election bid			0
any comeback would hinge on the outcome of the @entity7 case and a series of other legal cases involving people close to him , including alleged political rigging in an arbitration payout to a high - profile businessman			1

there he met at least four former members of @entity7 's staff , who said mr @entity6 regularly turned up at the @entity174 mansion in @entity150 to accept cash to help fund his 2007 election campaign			2
