by @entity0 a network of disused underground tunnels , that were once used to transport post across @entity5 , have been given the go - ahead to open as a tourist attraction			1
@entity8 first opened in 1927 and in its heyday used a series of driverless trains to transport post beneath the capital 's streets from the @entity16 's @entity15 to @entity17 in the west			2
undiscovered : the public have never before been allowed into the ' secret ' tunnels that were used by the @entity21 to distribute mail across @entity5 long forgotten : @entity24 stations and secret tunnels have long intrigued visitors to @entity5 , so the abandoned @entity8 is expected to attract a lot of attention mothballed : the @entity8 currently lies disused under the streets of @entity5 after the network of tunnels were abandoned in favour of road transport in 2003 @entity34 has approved plans to allow tourists to descend beneath the city and ride the trains that sit below some of the @entity5 's most iconic sights			1
from 2020 , visitors will be able to ride the ' secret tube ' , departing from @entity43 , in @entity44 , which was once one of the largest sorting offices in the world			0
the original track was 6.5 miles long and had a total of eight stations and at some stages narrowed to just 7ft wide			2
tourists will ride the miniature trains for a total of 0.6miles , while learning about the history of the @entity21			0
a world apart : more than 100 years ago the tunnels were approved for use by the rail mail trains , but they were abandoned in 2003 deeper underground : the miniature trains travelled more than 6 miles across @entity5 , with eight designated stops , passing below @entity62 and just feet away from the @entity63 @entity64 , an engineer who has worked in the tunnels , said : ' it 's the holy grail for underground explorers - a hidden part of the rail network			1
some people called it the @entity21 's best - kept secret			0
' @entity73 , director of the @entity74 , added : ' it is a fantastic opportunity that @entity44 borough council has given us - the green light to open up these unique tunnels to the public and reveal the captivating story of @entity8			1
' see the sights : the development of the ' secret tube ' into a tourist attraction will combine with the opening of a special museum devoted to the history of @entity90 's postal service bright future : the train , which will travel 0.6miles under @entity5 , will open in 2020 and will explore the history of the tunnels a new postal museum will also open on the @entity43 site in 2016 , displaying artefacts from @entity74 postal history , including telegrams from the @entity100 , original evidence from the @entity103 trial and pistols used to defend mail coaches in the @entity106			1
the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) still needs to raise £ 0.5million and will be launching a public appeal later in the year			0
it is also waiting to hear the outcome of an application for £ 4.5million from the @entity111			0
the @entity8 was finally closed in 2003 , after @entity112 built a new hub in @entity114 , west @entity5 and it was decided it would be cheaper to transport mail by road instead of using the tunnels .			0
