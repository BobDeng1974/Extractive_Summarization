@entity0 faces a diminished role in his return to the @entity3 , who have stripped him of his third - base job and plan to limit his role to full - time designated hitter , at most			1
@entity0 's days as an everyday fielder are over , general manager @entity9 said on tuesday , and @entity10 will start at third after agreeing this week to a $ 52 million ( £ 32.24m ) , four - year contract			1
coming off a season - long suspension for violations of @entity15 's drug agreement and labor contract , @entity0 will have to compete with @entity17 for time as @entity10 's backup at third			1
@entity3 ' @entity0 returns to baseball battling for a place as his team 's third base back - up ' i ca n't expect @entity0 to be anything , ' @entity9 said during a telephone interview with the @entity28			1
' i 've got to think the worst and hope for the best			0
even before the suspension , he was n't the same player at third base on the defensive or offensive side			2
and that was before the suspension			0
' and now he 's been out of the game for a year			2
he 's approaching 40 years of age			0
and just to automatically assume , given his circumstances , that he 'll be able to plug right in , play third as an everyday guy and hold up and be productive , that would be dangerous thinking from my perspective			0
' @entity0 turns 40 in july and has not played a full season since 2007 because of leg injuries , operations on both hips , and the suspension			2
@entity9 said @entity0 will have to prove to manager @entity49 he can play the field			1
general manager @entity9 expects ' nothing ' from @entity0 as he makes his comeback after a year ban @entity9 said he has not spoken with @entity0 about his new role			1
' i do n't need to			0
i 've been very consistent with my conversations publicly from october on , ' he said			0
' i have not heard from @entity0 on any of that , and i know he reads all this stuff			2
' @entity0 is owed $ 61mn ( £ 39m ) by the @entity3 in the final three seasons of his contract , and @entity61 could use improvement at dh - its players there combined to hit .230 this year ( 12th in the @entity66 ) with 18 homers ( 11th ) , 63 rbis ( 13th ) , a .290 on - base percentage ( 14th ) and a .372 slugging percentage ( 12th ) , according to @entity71			1
@entity61 anticipates @entity10 , a 2012 @entity72 winner , will be joined in the infield most days by @entity74 at shortstop , @entity17 at second , and @entity76 at first			0
' we believe we now have a very strong defensive infield , ' @entity9 said , ' that will serve our pitching staff and our run prevention well			0

@entity0 will be battling to be back - up for third base at the @entity3
general manager @entity9 *excepts* little from the 39 - year - old
@entity0 is returning from a season - long suspension for violations of @entity15 's drug agreement and labor contract
