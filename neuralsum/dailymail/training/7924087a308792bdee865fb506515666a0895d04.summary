by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 11:03 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 18:32 est , 9 october 2013 @entity3 has been scrambling to tamp down a controversy over suspended death benefits for the families of fallen military soldiers , and the @entity8 has announced that a charity would pick up the costs of the payments during the government shutdown			1
` the @entity14 will provide the families of the fallen with the benefits they so richly deserve , ` defense secretary @entity13 said in a statement , adding that the @entity18 would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ended			1
@entity21 said @entity14 , which works with veterans and their families , had approached the @entity18 about making the payments			1
the @entity18 typically pays families about $ 100,000 within three days of a soldier 's death , but officials say the shutdown was preventing those benefits from being paid			1
a senior defense official said the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations , but could accept an offer			0
@entity40 's body was brought back to the @entity41 after being killed in @entity42 on october 6			0
his funeral expenses are now being paid by a charity because of the shutdown respect : the @entity18 has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and secretary of defense @entity13 was at @entity49 when @entity40 's body arrived the failure to make the payments has stirred outrage both on @entity54 and at the @entity8			1
@entity56 spokesman @entity55 said wednesday that the president was ` disturbed ` when he found out the death benefits had been suspended and demanded an immediate solution			1
` the commander in chief , when he found out that this was not addressed , he directed that a solution be found , and we expect one today , ` @entity55 said before the @entity18 announced the agreement with @entity14			1
the @entity8 unanimously passed legislation wednesday to restore the death benefits but it 's unclear whether the @entity69 - led @entity68 will take up the measure or whether @entity56 would sign it			1
@entity56 has threatened to veto other legislation passed by the @entity8 in recent days that would reopen individual funding steams , arguing that a piecemeal approach was unacceptable and the entire government must be reopened			1
the fix has not satisfied all of the soldiers relatives , and one father can not believe that members of @entity81 are still getting paid during the shutdown			1
' if @entity81 were trapped in a car that sunk down in a river , i would swim to the window , and i would look them all in the eye and say , " suck water , " ' said @entity89 , the father of 24 - year - old @entity90 who was killed in the field			2
the names of the five soldiers who were killed have been released - sgt @entity94 , special agent @entity95 , @entity40 , @entity98 lcpl @entity96 , lt @entity99 - and @entity100 reports that they are all under the age of 25 years old			1
victims twice over : the relatives of sgt @entity94 ( left ) and 1st lt @entity99 ( right ) are now being denied survivors benefits from the military because of the federal shutdown anger : @entity38 @entity40 's ( left ) father is outraged at @entity81 , and @entity98 lcpl @entity96 ( right ) was the youngest of the fallen at only 19 - years - old father : special agent @entity95 , 24 , leaves behind a wife and 20 - month - old son ' after losing a loved one in service to our nation , these families should not have to endure more pain as the result of political squabbling , ' said @entity122 , the head of the military - focused charity that stepped up			1
mr @entity40 was not the only grieving family member to speak out , and a number of others have come forward			0
‘ the government is hurting the wrong people , ’ @entity127 , who lost her son , marine lance corporal @entity129 , over the weekend in @entity42 told @entity130			0
‘ families should n’t have to worry about how they ’re going to bury their child , ’ she added			2
‘ families should n’t have to worry about how they 're going to feed their family if they do n’t go to work this week			2
’ @entity138 was on his fourth deployment to @entity42 , he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier			0
‘ sgt. @entity94 was a brave and incredibly talented ranger , ’ lt. col. , @entity142 , the commander of the 3rd battalion , told @entity130			0
‘ his actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the @entity146 : ‘ i will never leave a fallen comrade			2
’ first lt. @entity149 was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team , it was her first combat deployment			0
‘ our unit mourns the loss of 1st lt. @entity99 , ’ lt col. @entity142 told @entity130			0
@entity157 was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what @entity130 termed ‘ murky circumstances			0
’ denied what they rightfully deserve , the families of these heroes should soon receive their benefits , according to @entity165			1
‘ tomorrow , the @entity8 is going to act specifically on this and i hope the president will sign it , ’ he said during a tuesday press conference			2
determined : @entity170 speaker of the house @entity165 has tried to submit a bill approving the payment of ' death benefits ' to military families but @entity69 do n't want to take a piecemeal approach to the budget approval process the payment of the so - called ' death benefits ' has become a political issue on its own as @entity165 speaker @entity165 has blasted @entity69 for failing to support his bill to fund the payouts before the budget is approved fully			1
' i think it 's disgraceful that they 're withholding these benefits , ' he said			2
the seemingly obvious move to pay the benefits is steeped in political motivations , however , as @entity165 and the @entity170 have repeatedly tried to push through smaller single - issue funding appropriations without agreeing to end the shutdown by approving an entire budget			1
president @entity56 was reportedly ' disturbed ' to find out that it would take longer than the standard three days to get the ' benefits ' to the relatives and press secretary @entity55 said that a solution would be found wednesday			1
' it is upsetting because my husband died for his country , and now his family is left to worry , ' @entity198 , the wife of @entity95 , told @entity130			0

' i 'm a stay - at - home mom , which is what my husband wanted			0
he wanted me to take care of our son			0
' the five soldiers whose funeral payments are being fought over are far from the only ones who face financial letdown			1
continued rhetoric : president @entity56 gave a press conference on tuesday saying that he would not negotiate under threat but @entity170 want certain services funded before approving the entire budget about 3.8 million veterans will not receive disability compensation next month if the partial government shutdown continues into late october , veterans affairs secretary @entity220 says			1
some 315,000 veterans and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped			0
@entity220 is spelling out some of the dire consequences of a longer - term shutdown in testimony wednesday for the @entity231			2
the short - term consequences have meant that disability claims production has slowed by an average of about 1,400 per day since the shutdown began october 1 , and that has stalled the department 's efforts to reduce the backlog of disability claims pending for longer than 125 days			0
in all , more than $ 6 billion in payments would be halted with an extended shutdown			2
' in some areas , like health care delivery , there are fewer adverse effects			0
in others , such as reducing the claims backlog , we have already seen a negative impact , ' @entity220 says in written testimony obtained by @entity252 in advance of the hearing			0
the @entity8 has passed legislation that would provide veterans disability , pension and other benefits in the event of a prolonged shutdown , but the @entity8 has pushed against the piecemeal approach			2
@entity220 plans to make that case as well , saying it 's not the best solution for veterans			0
he 'll note that even if the @entity268 were fully funded , some services to veterans would suffer .			0
