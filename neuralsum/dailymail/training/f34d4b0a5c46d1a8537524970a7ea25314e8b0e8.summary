by @entity0 published : 06:13 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 3 october 2013 with delicate central carvings that appear to be growing from the solid wood on either side , the @entity1 is n't your average sitting room centrepiece			1
crafted from walnut wood and plexiglass , the piece is the brainchild of @entity12 architect and designer @entity13 who says his unusual design was inspired by growing things as well as the relationships between people			1
' while i was developing the @entity1 , i kept thinking about about the relationships between people as they sit across [ the table ] from each other , ' explained the @entity23 - born designer			1
creative : the hidden plexiglass support makes the table appear as if it is growing branches delicate : the fragile branch details are toughened up with protective plexiglass ' tension , attraction , repulsion , connection - i wanted to reveal it all			2
i had a desire to map the unseen , although part of the table 's geometry was inspired by growing forces in trees and traditional @entity43 joinery			2
' while the table can be used like a normal coffee table - you can pile books and the remote control on it - @entity13 hopes that those who buy one will treat it as more than just a piece of furniture			2
functional : @entity13 hopes that people will see the table as a piece of art as well as furniture project : along with the @entity1 , @entity13 has also made a table lamp from old cassette tapes ' i consider it to be more like a functional inspiring art piece , ' he explains			1
' i hope people will be moved by it and encouraged to connect and spend more time together while embracing the unique craftsmanship and enjoying the ownership of a piece that will last a lifetime			0
' striking though it is , the @entity1 is n't the only foray into furniture design that @entity13 , and his design consultancy @entity74 , have made			1
the @entity76 is also behind the @entity77 , a limited - edition light fitting made using recycled cassette tapes			0
limited edition : the @entity77 , made from recycled cassettes other works include an ' @entity83 ' made from frosted acrylic and created to dress a @entity86 set			0
he has also designed the ' @entity88 ' , a light , ultra-modern building that hakhovich hopes will one day be built in @entity12			0
despite his big plans , @entity13 says smaller works such as the @entity1 dovetail neatly with his more grandiose efforts			1
' i use small - scale work like furniture and installations as a research and testing grounds for some ideas that later will be translated or incorporated into large scale work , ' he explains			0
' i find working across multiple scales very satisfying			0
' but not quite as satisfying , perhaps , as those who manage to get their hands on the incredible @entity1 .			0

the @entity1 is the brainchild of designer @entity13
crafted from a *mixture* of walnut wood and plexiglass
inspired by growing things and relationships between people
