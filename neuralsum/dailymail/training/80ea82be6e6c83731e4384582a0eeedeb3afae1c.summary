by @entity0 the elderly could be given state - funded cleaners so their relatives no longer have to quit their jobs to look after them			1
under a plan backed by the care minister , those no longer able to carry out household tasks would be issued with vouchers to put towards gardeners , cooks and cleaners			2
a report claims the system , which is already used in @entity15 and @entity16 , would help the economy by creating more than 700,000 jobs and stopping relatives having to leave work			1
a helping hand : ministers have suggested that the elderly be given state - funded cleaners so their relatives no longer have to quit their jobs to look after them the report , endorsed by @entity25 care minister @entity25 , has also been backed by a coalition of academics , charities and leading employers			1
the combination of @entity32 ’s ageing population and the rising cost of care is expected to put increasing pressure on younger family members to look after their elderly relatives			0
and the report estimates that the exodus of experienced employees from the workplace is already costing the @entity32 economy £ 1.3billion every year			1
it says that the voucher system would take pressure off family members who are often unable to maintain their jobs while providing care for elderly relatives			1
a report backing the scheme has been endorsed by @entity25 care minister @entity25 the schemes cost billions to implement in @entity15 and @entity16 , but the report argues that the subsidised employment of thousands of carers would benefit the economy			1

the report concludes : ‘ while recognising that in the current ﬁnancial climate it may be challenging to apply some of these approaches , the group believes that there are some useful learning points from these overseas examples			2
it therefore wishes to consider alternative , more targeted interventions with the potential to unlock similar outcomes			0
‘ [ it ] recommends that the government works with selected local authorities in different areas to investigate alternative methods for supporting carers to remain in work , and for developing the care and support market more generally			0
‘ @entity86 now may lead to a ﬁnancial proﬁt as well as creating huge social and health value			0
’ @entity89 , the director of innovation at @entity62 , said : ‘ government must urgently examine how to cultivate good quality , affordable care services for older people who do n’t qualify for local council social care services which are increasingly being rationed to only those with little or no savings and the highest levels of need			0

the system is already used in @entity15 and @entity16
report claims it would create more than 700,000 jobs
