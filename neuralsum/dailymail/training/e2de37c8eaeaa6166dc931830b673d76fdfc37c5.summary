click here to read the full match report from the @entity2 several years ago after watching a routine @entity5 victory at the @entity2 , @entity3 was asked just why sir @entity7 's team seemed to find it easier than others in @entity9			0
as well as being a @entity5 player in the 1970s , @entity3 was a @entity13 manager in the 1990s , back in the days when the arena of intimidation was the rather more functional @entity16 down the @entity17 ' from here			1
@entity3 knows how things work in this part of the world and his answer was immediate			0
@entity22 got his tactics right as @entity24 defeated @entity13 2 - 0 at the @entity2 @entity24 players celebrate after ensuring that they would be top of the table at @entity28 the @entity24 manager speaks to @entity13 's tough tackler @entity30 ( right ) after the game ' it 's simple , ' he said			1
' too many teams come here anticipating a physical battle and start messing with their team and tactics			0
they pick big ' physical ' players			0
' @entity5 , though , always come here and pick footballers and tell them to play better football than @entity13			2
' it was tempting to think back to that conversation here on monday night and conclude that it remains as pertinent now as it did then			0
@entity13 's current manager @entity46 has tweaked his team 's style a little			2
they do play slightly differently than they did in the @entity51 days , even if his right - back @entity30 did his best to drag us all back to another era altogether with some wretched early tackling on monday night			1
nevertheless , @entity13 still present an athletic challenge that some managers try – and often fail – to nullify with a like for like approach			1
it is a peculiar tactic and one that @entity22 eschewed very sensibly			2
@entity30 showed that @entity13 's reputation as a physical team has n't completely disappeared @entity61 ( left ) is left writhing on the ground after the challenge that could have seen @entity30 sent off @entity22 and @entity13 boss @entity46 became involved in a touchline spat over the tackle all @entity67 footballers should be able to look after themselves physically , whoever they are and what ever position they play			1
if they ca n't then they arguably should n't be playing the game			0
just like the great @entity5 teams of the past – and indeed @entity75 's really good @entity74 teams – @entity22 's modern @entity24 combine the physical and the technical expertly			1
they are footballers first and foremost but , equally , you would n't mind having them by your side when it gets lively in the pub on a friday night either			0
it is this combination that makes them so irresistibly impressive and clear favourites to win the first @entity67 title of @entity22 's second spell at @entity89			1
@entity13 's early approach was robust to say the least			2
@entity30 should have been booked for a tackle on @entity61 by the @entity24 byline and could perhaps have received a straight red for another on the @entity95 at the other end soon after			1
@entity97 opens the scoring with a header to help send @entity24 three points clear at the top of the table @entity22 has built a @entity24 side that combines both physical and technical attributes @entity105 ( right ) gave another commanding performance at the heart of @entity24 's midfield @entity24 did n't like it			1
@entity22 waved an imaginary card around on the touchline and became involved in a bickering contest with the particularly irritable @entity46			2
crucially , though , @entity24 did n't allow the feuding to transfer itself to the field			2
they ensured it remained a football match and that was key			0
the league leaders ' opening goal came after only a minute or so and was headed in from a corner by @entity97			1
the match reports will detail a set piece goal but what they probably wo n't talk about is the lovely piece of intelligent attacking football that led to a shot that led to the corner in the first place			2
similarly , @entity24 's other really good chance of the opening 45 minutes came on the back of a passage of terrific football to which @entity13 just had no answer			1
@entity135 ca n't fault @entity13 performance @entity138 playmaker hazard ( right ) played a crucial role in setting up @entity24 's second goal @entity141 scored only his second league goal this season to double @entity24 's lead the @entity145 drops to his knees to celebrate as @entity24 show why they are favourites to win the title a stunningly well - timed tackle from @entity105 allowed hazard to feed @entity141 and when the @entity67 's top assist - maker slid the ball through to @entity152 the @entity145 should have closed out the game instead of rolling his shot a foot wide of the far post			1
it was an unusual piece of negligence from @entity152 but the part played in the move by @entity105 was terrific			0
the @entity161 is a sensational footballer and his contribution was bettered only by hazard who played his football gamely and bravely all night			0
it was fitting he played a part in @entity24 's second goal and his performance typified his team 's courage and indomitable spirit			1
it all comes from their manager , of course			0
few people set the tone like @entity22 does			0
it 's never easy here but this was as close to being comfortable as it gets			0
as @entity3 once said , the key is to come here not to fight but to play .			0

@entity24 defeated @entity13 2 - 0 in their @entity67 clash on monday
@entity22 game plan involving *strength* and technique worked
