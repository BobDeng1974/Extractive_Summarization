@entity1 boss @entity0 has taken a swipe at @entity3 after @entity4 signed a pre-contract with @entity6			1
the 24 - year - old has agreed to switch to @entity8 in the summer , but the champions – who are also continuing their pursuit of @entity13 midfielder @entity12 – are set to try to strike a deal to accelerate the move			1
@entity1 are thought to be seeking a £ 250,000 fee to let @entity4 go in the current transfer window			1
@entity3 admitted this week that landing the winger this month would be his preference - and that aspect of the pursuit has upset @entity0			1
@entity1 player @entity4 , 24 , has signed a pre-contract at @entity6 @entity1 manager @entity0 has hit out at @entity6 's attempt to acquire @entity4 this month ‘ i ’m not comfortable with it , ’ he said			1
‘ i like to speak about players behind the scenes and i do n’t think it ’s right to speak publicly about it			2
he ( @entity3 ) has his own way of doing things but i would n’t want to speak about one of his players under contract			1
‘ @entity4 is our player , he ’s an important player and we have a lot of important games coming up starting with this next one against @entity39			1
‘ so would i go out and speak about another player under contract and say i want to take him just now ? no. ‘ i ’ll speak to @entity42 to make sure he focuses			2
he is our player , not anybody else ’s , until the summer when his contract ends			2
‘ @entity4 has made it clear from pre-season he ’s happy to stay on to the end of his contract			2
so , for me , there is no difference at this moment			0
despite all the speculation - despite other managers saying they want to take him now - that does n’t come into it for me			2
’ @entity6 manager @entity3 admitted his preference would be to bring @entity4 to @entity8 this month @entity1 are just a point behind @entity6 in the @entity56 and believe they can win silverware @entity0 believes @entity4 remains determined to sign off his stint at @entity1 on a high			1
the @entity13 side currently sit third in the @entity56 and remain in both the @entity61 and @entity62			1
‘ from pre-season , he ’s said he wants to win a trophy with @entity1 , ’ added former @entity6 captain @entity0			1
‘ it will possibly help him to have his future settled rather than the uncertainty of running down his contract			0
‘ he ’s a good sensible boy and hopefully now he can just get on with playing for us for the rest of the season			0
the club was always prepared for him leaving for nothing in the summer because it ’s worth every penny of that financial hit to keep him here until the end of the season			2
‘ obviously the fans will find out he ’s going and he has to accept certain things may come with that			0
but he ’s been a great servant to us so we ’re hopeful that , after he goes at the end of the season , he ’ll go on and be successful in his career			0
’ @entity6 full - back @entity85 will welcome @entity4 to the club after admitting he ’s been one of his toughest @entity56 opponents			1
@entity4 in action during @entity1 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity8 last season @entity4 celebrates his second goal against @entity1 at @entity13 on @entity93 ‘ i ’ve always had a difficult game when i ’ve played against him , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’d put him up there with the best in @entity99			0
he ’s got pace , a trick , good delivery and scores goals			0
’ the @entity104 international has also been the subject of transfer debate , with @entity108 rumoured to be keen on taking him home - potentially in a trade for @entity112 midfielder @entity111			1
finally free of injury issues that have scarred the last two seasons , however , @entity85 insists his commitment to @entity6 has not diminished over a three - and - a - half - year stay and there is now a sense of making up for lost time			1
‘ do i see my future here ? yeah , definitely , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve enjoyed it since i first walked in the door			0
i ’m very happy , i love the city and the fans have been brilliant with me			0
‘ i ’ve heard nothing from my agent about clubs interested in me , it ’s just talk			0
i ’m 100 - per - cent focused on @entity6			1
i ’ve seen the stuff about @entity108 and i think nothing of it			0
‘ it ’s been a difficult 18 months , but i feel fit and it ’s the best i ’ve felt since i picked up my injury against @entity135			0
now i want to get a good second half of the season			0
’ @entity6 are also interested in signing @entity1 's @entity12 @entity6 returned from the sunshine of their training camp in @entity140 to the snow of @entity142 and face a four - point deficit to @entity143 , albeit with two games in hand , ahead of today ’s trip to @entity147			1
@entity85 is confident they will respond to the challenge			0
‘ we ’ve looked switched on in training since getting home			0
the @entity143 are ahead , so the pressure is on us to win the matches we have in hand			2
we ’re second in the table but if we win our games , we go top again			2
that ’s a pressure but it ’s one we like			0
’ @entity147 recorded a historic 1 - 0 win at @entity8 to briefly top the @entity56 in early october , but @entity85 senses revenge today			1
‘ we missed a stackload of chances , ’ he insisted			0
‘ hopefully , we can put that right with a win and get back into the swing of things in the league			2
