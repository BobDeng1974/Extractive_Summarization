a @entity1 woman who snatched a newborn baby and raised her as her own for nearly 18 years was today banned by a judge from any contact with the child			1
the 50 - year - old was ordered to live at a secret address isolated from the girl she 'd brought up and the husband she 'd deceived when she appeared in court following her arrest for kidnapping			1
yesterday the biological mother of @entity16 who was snatched from her arms in hospital in april 1997 , thanked the stranger who had brought her up for ' doing a good job ' in an exclusive interview with @entity22			1
today @entity23 and @entity24 were forced to stand in the packed @entity25 as the seamstress who had stolen their three day old baby was granted bail with strict conditions			0
the seamstress , from a poverty - stricken suburb of @entity25 , looked grief - stricken but managed to smile weakly at a clutch of friends who had gathered to support her in court			1
outside court , @entity58 , a neighbour of the accused was emotional as she recalled the day her friend had brought her baby girl home from hospital in april 1997			2
' we were so thrilled for her , she looked so happy , ' she said			0
' we have watched that child grow up , what a lovely girl she is			2
' we helped change her nappies and she was so cute and smiley , everyone loved her , she played with my own daughters			0
' as a mother and child they just seemed just to fit together – like a proper family			1
the mother is a lovely , lovable woman , always smiling and kind and will do anything for you			1
' we are all just in shock , and pain			0
now the house is empty , and we miss them			0
' it was the husband who came to tell us what had happened , when she had been arrested for kidnap			1
my knees went weak , i felt numb when he told us			0
' he looked shocked , broken , he did n't know a thing			0
no one did , only she knew this secret and she kept it all these years			2
' relief : unbelievably , @entity23 has revealed she has already forgiven the woman who kidnapped her daughter shock : @entity16 ( pictured ) is coming to terms with the fact her family is not who she thought they were @entity16 , who was given a different name by the woman – neither of whom can be identified – is being cared for by social workers and has met her biological family three times since discovering her real identity			1
it is understood she has also seen the man she thought of as her father , who was in court but unable to answer any questions , only shaking his head in apparent shock			2
the girl , who turns 18 next month , learned she had been stolen at birth following an extraordinary twist of fate when her long lost sister , 13 - year - old @entity125 , joined her school			1
unaware they were related , the girls struck up a close friendship , despite their age difference , and soon became inseparable			2
once @entity24 , 37 , learned of his daughter 's new older friend ' who looks just like us ' , he sought her out and immediately felt an inexplicable bond with the girl			1
the electrical sales rep then carried out his own investigation into the 17 - year - old , scanning her @entity140 page for information which would help prove she was the three - day - old baby who 'd been taken from his sleeping wife 's arms			1
anger : there is a feeling of betrayal in the community where @entity16 was raised on the @entity151 , with many questioning how this lie has been able to go on beneath their noses for so many years precious : the family only have a few photos of @entity16 taken before she was snatched			1
here she is with her uncle @entity157 in @entity158 on april 29 , 1997 the father of four told @entity22 , ' when i saw @entity16 for the first time the feeling was there completely			1
' i looked at her and i do n't know what it was , but i fell in love with my daughter when i saw her , i thought ' wow what is this feeling ? ' i do n't know how to express myself , it was confusion , attraction , confusion , it was everything all in one			2
' and she said later that it was the same from her			0
' he downloaded a picture of the woman who was raising @entity16 from the girl 's @entity140 page and sent it to a witness who had seen the woman , dressed in a nurse 's uniform , carrying the baby away from @entity23 as she slept , heavily medicated following a cesarean section			1
she confirmed that it was the kidnapper she had seen at the @entity41 more than 17 years before			0
@entity24 also sent a photograph of the girl to @entity23 , 36 , who immediately recognised her as @entity190			0
' when he sent me the photo i burst into tears , she looked exactly like @entity125			0
she had the same face , ear lobes , nose , she was the same			0
i said ' this is my daughter '			0
instinct : @entity24 ( centre , arriving at court with ex-wife @entity23 , left ) said he recognised his nearly 18 - year - old daughter immediately - despite not having seen her since she was just three days old appeals : the family has worked hard to make sure people do n't forget about their missing daughter over the years , including a big appeal in 2010 in the local newspaper the @entity209 , but no one ever come forward once they were satisfied that they had enough evidence , they contacted police who carried out dna tests and proved they had traced their own child			1
during the short court hearing , the accused did not look in the direction of @entity24 and @entity23 – who are now divorced			0
both families have lived only streets apart for all of @entity16 's life and the poverty - stricken community of @entity227 , where drugs and gangs are rife , are divided over the extraordinary story			1
it is understood that the baby snatcher had had a still birth before she took @entity234 and was able to breastfeed the newborn and bring her home from hospital without raising suspicion , even from her own husband			1
the packed , wood - pannelled court heard that the accused is in ' precarious health ' , and is understood to suffer from diabetes and a heart condition			0
prosecutor @entity243 did not oppose the application for bail , which was set at 350 pounds			0
the woman will have to report to the police station near to her new address which was not revealed in court			2
releasing the woman on bail , mr @entity49 ordered her to ' make no contact directly or indirectly with any witnesses in this matter , including the child '			2
he specified that this included ' via @entity140 , social media , whatsapp , or sending any messages with third parties '			0
she is next due to appear in court on may 29 .			0

@entity263 banned from contacting girl she snatched from mother 's arms
went on to raise @entity16 as her own - even tricking her husband
thought the 50 - year - old had suffered a *stillbirth* shortly before the kidnap
@entity16 has now *finally* been *reunited* with her biological family
*remarkable* twist of fate meant @entity234 became friends with her sister , 13
*similarities* between the girls instantly noticed and the lie was uncovered
