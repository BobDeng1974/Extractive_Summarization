referencing @entity1 's remarks at the @entity6 the first week in february , during which he said @entity7 need to get off their ' high horse ' when it comes to critiquing @entity10 , @entity0 told a group of conservatives that lectures like the president 's ' wo n't stop the @entity10 from killing the @entity7			1
' ' while @entity7 bow our head to pray for you , radical islamists want to cut off your head , ' she said of the president			1
' aside from @entity42 almighty , ' she said , the only force that can keep ' barbaric ' terrorists at bay and ' the only thing standing between us and savages is the red white and blue			0
