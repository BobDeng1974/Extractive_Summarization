yesterday , @entity17 , from @entity18 in @entity19 , described how he ' desperately swam and clawed ' through the avalanche before being catapulted feet - first down the mountain			1
a headshot of @entity17 , taken by himself three minutes after the avalanche to assess his injuries , shows his swollen and bloodied face			1

speaking from his home in the @entity36 , in the @entity37 , he said : ' all i could see was white			2
i was freefalling in this white room			2
my mouth was gagged with snow			2
i spat it out but it just filled up again			2
i shoved my fingers in my mouth to unplug it			2
' i was on this roller - coaster			2
' i felt gutted because i knew i was going to die			1
i kept shouting : " no , no , no " with a few swear words added in			2
' this was the way i was going to go			2
this was my lights out			2
' @entity17 , who works as a transfer driver and is also sponsored by clothing brand @entity54 , was climbing with fellow @entity7 @entity55 , 30 , a photographer from @entity57 , and @entity59 @entity58 , 33			2
they set off from @entity36 at 1am last tuesday to climb @entity5			1
the three experienced mountaineers picked a technical route well within their capabilities that involved summitting the 13,294 - ft @entity63			2
@entity17 , who has climbed @entity5 five times , said : ' i got to the summit of the @entity66 before the other two			1
it was about 12.30pm and there was no point in hanging around			2
i was tired and the winds had picked up			2
they were only just behind but out of sight around the ridge			1
@entity17 took this picture of himself three minutes after the avalanche to assess his injuries ' i put my hood up and kept going			1
i could see @entity5 in the distance			1
i was just plodding along the ridge , locked in my own wee world , when silently and unexpectedly i fell on my left side			1
i could n’t grasp what was happening			0
' the whole mountain started cracking into a huge jigsaw of snow blocks			1
the avalanche was 500 feet wide			1
he said : ' i tried so hard to claw at the snow			0
i was swimming for my life			0
i was doing a kind of front - crawl , desperately trying to swim my way to the top of the slope that was going with me			0
' all i could see was white			0
i was freefalling in this white room			0
my mouth was gagged with snow			0
i spat it out but it just filled up again ' - @entity1 ' i was completely desperate			1
your mind is telling you that is it , but you just physically keep trying			0
the top was only a metre away and i gained some ground but it was too late			0
' i was desperately trying to get over the slab that was going with me			0
i tried and tried but i was well and truly engrossed in the avalanche			1
' after these few seconds i knew i was going down			0
' the south face of the @entity66 has a rock ridge running horizontally across it			1
@entity17 believes his life may have been saved by the fact that he was catapulted over the steepest and smallest section of this cliff			0
to the left and the right there are expansive rocks			0
he said : ' by now i was in the avalanche feet - first , facing outwards			1
i was traveling at quite a speed			0
' i remember going over the rock ridge because i was in free - fall			1
it was like being on a roller - coaster going down			0
this picture shows the final footsteps @entity17 took along the ridge before he was taken by the avalanche @entity17 ( right ) was climbing with fellow @entity7 @entity55 ( left ) , 30 , and @entity58 ( centre ) , 33 ' it felt like i was a while in the air before hitting something			1
' i was thinking : " this is really it			0
i am going off a cliff			0
i am going to die			1
" ' the vertical drop off the ridge was about 200 feet			1
when he landed he was hurled with the avalanche debris a further 1,500 feet			1
suddenly he came to a halt			0
he was sat bolt upright on the avalanche debris which was about three feet deep			1
@entity146 was dripping on the snow from his face			1
his camera was undamaged and he took a photograph of his face to assess his facial injuries			1
the three experienced mountaineers set off from @entity36 at 1am last tuesday to climb @entity5 ( pictured ) he said : ' i had cut my nose and my mouth was a bit swollen			1
my left leg hurt but i knew it was n’t broken			0
and that was about it , apart from a few other cuts			0
' he managed to hobble across the slope , praying for a signal on his phone , when suddenly 20 minutes later he saw a red dot near the summit of @entity66			0
it was @entity55 ’s jacket			0
he could very faintly hear his friends shouting			0
he then heard a helicopter			0
@entity17 has described how he ' desperately swam and clawed ' through the avalanche before being catapulted feet - first down the mountain his friends had called rescuers some 10 minutes earlier to report their missing friend			1
they had been following @entity17 ’s tracks leading to the summit of the @entity66 when suddenly they stopped			0
@entity55 said : ' i was walking in the tracks @entity17 had made and suddenly they stopped dead			1
i saw there had been an avalanche and did not believe it was survivable			1
' i screamed at @entity182 to call mountain rescue			1
we told them there had been an avalanche and there was no sign of our friend			1
it ’s really not describable how we felt			0
' and then to see this unmistakable speck hobbling around down in the distance a good 25 minutes later was the most wonderful feeling			0
he was alive and mobile			0
' when we were in the rescue helicopter i managed to take a picture of the ridge			2
it shows how @entity202 ’s trail suddenly stops and the crown of the avalanche			2
' the trio were airlifted off the mountain and @entity17 underwent a number of tests in hospital in @entity210 , @entity211			2
but he was pronounced fit enough to be discharged later that night			0
he said : ' it was a very unlucky incident that happened to a very lucky boy			0
there had been no tell - tale signs			0
nothing felt strange or unsafe			0
' one day i will redo this route but there ’s no intention to do it anytime soon			0
