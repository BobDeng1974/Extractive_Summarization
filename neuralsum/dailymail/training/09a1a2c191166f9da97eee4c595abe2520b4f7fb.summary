vast freshwater reserves have been discovered under the ocean floor which scientists believe could sustain future generations			0
@entity5 researchers claim to have found 500,000 cubic kilometres ( 120,000 cubic miles ) of freshwater buried beneath the seabed on continental shelves off @entity5 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the discovery comes as @entity16 estimates suggest water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of the population of the world over the last century			1
@entity5 researchers have discovered vast freshwater reserves beneath the seabed on continental shelves lead author @entity21 , from @entity22 , said : ‘ the volume of this water resource is a hundred times greater than the amount we 've extracted from the @entity28 's sub-surface in the past century since 1900			1
‘ @entity29 on our planet is increasingly under stress and strain so the discovery of significant new stores off the coast is very exciting			2
‘ it means that more options can be considered to help reduce the impact of droughts and continental water shortages			1
’ according to @entity16 water estimates , water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of population in the last century due to demands such as irrigated agriculture and meat production			1
more than 40 per cent of the world 's population already live in conditions of water scarcity			2
by 2030 , @entity53 estimates that 47 per cent of people will exist under high water stress			2
scientists hope the discovery will help reduce the impact of droughts and continental water shortages mr @entity21 said his team 's findings were drawn from a review of seafloor water studies done for scientific or oil and gas exploration purposes			1
‘ by combining all this information we 've demonstrated that the freshwater below the seafloor is a common finding , and not some anomaly that only occurs under very special circumstances , ’ he said			0
the deposits were formed over hundreds of thousands of years in the past , when the sea level was much lower and areas now under the ocean were exposed to rainfall which was absorbed into the underlying water table			2
when the polar icecaps started melting about 20,000 years ago these coastlines disappeared under water , but their aquifers remain intact - protected by layers of clay and sediment			0
@entity84 said the deposits were comparable with the bore basins currently relied upon by much of the world for drinking water and would cost much less than seawater to desalinate			0
drilling for the water would be expensive , and @entity84 said great care would have to be taken not to contaminate the aquifers			0
he warned that they were a precious resource			0
‘ we should use them carefully : once gone , they wo n't be replenished until the sea level drops again , which is not likely to happen for a very long time , ’ mr @entity21 said .			0
