by @entity0 a @entity2 designer has created a silk scarf which very closely resembles a meaty rasher of bacon			1
entitled , the @entity7 , its name plays on the @entity10 term for a thin scarf or handkerchief , ' @entity6 ' , and also the @entity10 for bacon , which is simply : ' lard '			2
digitally printed on delicate silk , the hyper - realistic bacon scarf - not cheap at $ 165 - is admittedly a mouth - watering thing to behold , with detail all the way down to its ' crispy ' black rolled hem			1
introducing the @entity7 : @entity2 designer @entity23 designed this unusual silk scarf , which is digitally printed and costs $ 165 the scarf 's designer , @entity23 , writes on her website : ' my work is often inspired by topics of the realm of food culture			1
the comparison of appearance and reality , nature and culture , as well as the discussion about good and bad taste are fascinating aspects to me			0
' a quick glance through some of her other projects reveals a rather morbid fixation with dead animals			0
a necklace hung with moths , another made from ' horse teeth ' and the ceramic recreation of an edible organ for example			0
@entity55 style : the 100 per cent silk scarf appears to be keeping this woman nice and warm as she poses in arctic conditions almost edible : even the blackened ' crispy ' edges of the rolled hem closely resembles a delicious rasher of bacon swanky : ms @entity23 released a limited number of the scarves in 2011 , but they are yet to sell out @entity55 lover : supermodel @entity69 ( pictured ) has enjoyed a very public love affair with her favorite meaty snack , even tweeting herself in her very own pair of bacon - themed socks ( left ) describing her unusual fares , ms @entity23 writes : ' the wearer overtakes the qualities of the slaid animal and blazons himself with the heroic hunting story [ sic ]			1
' you might assume the @entity7 to be a fast - food fashion anomaly , but there appears to exist something of a bacon - themed clothing sub-culture in today 's @entity85			2
@entity86 sells an entire line of bacon - inspired clothing			0
and supermodel of the moment @entity69 regularly sings the praises of her favorite meaty snack , even joyously acquiring a pair of bacon - decorated socks for herself not too long ago			0
