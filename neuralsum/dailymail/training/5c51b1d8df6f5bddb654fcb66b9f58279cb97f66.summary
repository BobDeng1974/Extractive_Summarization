by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 11:57 est , 11 october 2013 if you are faced with a dirty floor but do n't have the energy to clean it , @entity2 company @entity1 might just have the solution you 've been searching for			1
the @entity7 works like a regular mop but is operated by remote control , which means you can clean the floor from the comfort of your sofa			1
amazingly , the robo - mob , which comes in colourful canary yellow plastic , costs just £ 19 - similar to traditional mops and far less than high - tech steam versions			2
and if one remote controlled kitchen gadget is n't enough to satisfy your technological cravings , the company also makes a remote controlled dustbin - seen zooming around like a mini @entity35 in @entity37 's promotional video			1
bizarre though the mop might seem , it 's not the first automatic floor cleaning product on the market			0
robotic vacuum cleaners , that zoom around a room cleaning a floor at the touch of a button , have been around for years			0
although they have not taken off to replace the traditional vacuum , the makers of the robo - mop have not been deterred			2
the invention is arguably more useful than other gadgets that have come from of @entity2 in recent years			2
the country is famous for its technological creations , among them the ' crisp picker - upper ' immortalised by @entity56 star @entity55 during an episode set in @entity2			1
colourful : @entity37 's time saving gizmo also comes in an £ 18 mini version that works similarly to the original other wacky inventions include the @entity62 , a tiny camcorder designed to be inserted into the ear to check for wax deposits and the @entity66 intended to reduce the size of your mouth			1
for beauty conscious women with a shaky hand , there 's the lipstick mask , which , when laid over the mouth , acts as a template for clumsy lipstick fans			0
more useful , particularly for those living in the @entity79 and @entity80 , is the full body umbrella which combines a brolly with a tube of clear pvc that extends to the feet - ideal for driving rain			0
less so are the odd @entity86 and poo dolls - designed to resemble the contents of your toilet - and the unwieldy @entity91 shovel , which combines a spade with a rake , clippers and a pickaxe			0
and action ! the mop works equally well on rubbish and spillages according to the rather odd promotional video			0

the time - saving @entity1 mop is operated by remote control
a mini version is also available and comes in an array of hues
the @entity2 company behind it also makes a remote controlled bin
