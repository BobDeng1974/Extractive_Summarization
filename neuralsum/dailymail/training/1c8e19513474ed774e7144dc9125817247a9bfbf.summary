by @entity0 published : 12:20 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 19:11 est , 3 april 2013 marmalade , royalty , bungalow and booze – they might seem quintessentially @entity7 words			1
but an exhibition opening today reveals that some of our most common words are in fact not ours at all			2
the @entity13 , staged at the @entity14 in @entity15 , examines how we absorb words from overseas and although @entity7 originally developed from germanic dialects , there are plenty of individual foreign words which have since been added to our vocabulary			1
foreign invasion : the word ' zombie ' was created by merging the @entity26 words for ' fetish ' and ' god ' the word booze , for example , has its origins in the medieval @entity33 word busen , which means ‘ to drink to excess ’ – and was first used in @entity7 by the thieves and beggars of the 1500s			1
and despite an urban myth that the word bungalow was coined when a builder was told to ‘ bung a low roof ’ on a house after running out of bricks , it actually originated in the @entity47 region of @entity48			1
there it was a name for one - storey homes built for early @entity53 immigrants , meaning ‘ belonging to @entity47 ’			2
among other absorbed words are : royal , which came from @entity57 during the middle ages ; marmalade , taken in the 1400s from the @entity62 word marmelo meaning ‘ quince ’ ; and shampoo , which derived from the @entity66 word for ‘ press or knead ’ and came to mean ‘ massage ’ in 18th - century @entity7			1
meanwhile zombie and vampire – ever - popular characters in @entity7 - speaking films – have their roots in @entity26 and @entity74 respectively			1
even the word for a favourite @entity7 drink , cider , originated from the @entity78			1
bloody mary : we may have named the drink after an @entity7 queen , but both tomato and booze are foreign words , the former being an old @entity86 word for grow and the latter old @entity33 slang for excessive drinking 1			1

@entity103 , director of strategy at the @entity14 , said that examining the roots of these words can offer an insight into our history			0
‘ many of our most popular and evocative @entity7 words – words we could n’t live without – came from other countries and cultures , ’ he said			1
‘ when we look at their roots , we get a fascinating insight into how the language has been influenced throughout its history			0
‘ @entity7 is not just “ our ” language – it truly belongs to the whole world , and brings real benefits to anyone who can speak it			2
' even a few words can bring work , a job or new opportunities			0
’ split into three zones the first part of the exhibition examines the value of learning @entity7 and the personal benefit it brings to people from around the world			1
a ‘ talking wall ’ allows individuals , among them footballers @entity137 and @entity139 , to discuss how the language helps them express themselves and form friendships with their teammates			0
the second zone addresses the economic value of the language which remains an essential part of entry into many industries			0
the @entity7 teaching industry alone is worth around £ 2billion to the @entity151 economy			2
the free exhibition runs until june 29 .			0
