@entity49 , who worked as a parole officer at @entity51 in @entity52 in the mid- 1970s , claims he came across the teenaged mr @entity9 while he was serving a five - month sentence for possession of lsd			1
denial : mr @entity9 insists the work is not by him and says he was not arrested as the man claims in papers filed at a federal court in @entity60 , he described seeing him work on a painting of a desert landscape , painted on a linen canvas measuring 34in by 41in			1

' the painting is signed with the name ' @entity77 ' , which mr @entity49 claims was the name mr @entity9 used during his time in detention			1
the former parole officer says that a friend suggested to him that the work could be by the artist , due to its similarities to other landscapes by mr @entity9			1
some experts have pointed out that its eery atmosphere and empty landscape are reminiscent of the artist 's other works , but others claim that it is not impressionistic enough to be by him			0
mr @entity49 is now attempting to sell the work through a @entity60 gallery - but the painting will only be considered valuable if it is authenticated by the artist himself			0
