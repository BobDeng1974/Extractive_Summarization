his mother , @entity42 , 25 , said : ' @entity6 kept telling me that he felt poorly			1
i knew something was n't right , so i took him back to the gp			2
' he basically told me that everything was fine , but i would n't give up			2
' i asked for a second opinion , and it was only then that i was told @entity6 was having a serious allergic reaction and that i needed to take him to hospital			1

ms @entity42 , a full - time mother , said : ' we were absolutely devastated			2
@entity6 was so frightened and kept asking why he hurt so much			2
' because of all of the morphine , he was completely out of it and did n't understand what was going on			0
' i could n't even hug him , as his skin could have fallen off in chunks			2
' it broke my heart to see him so afraid , but @entity137 and i had to stay strong for him			0

' over the next two weeks , ms @entity42 and @entity6 's father @entity137 , an aerospace technician , kept vigil as their son was was attached to a feeding tube and pumped with steroids to treat the reaction			2
to save his skin and sight , doctors applied eye drops and changed his dressings every two hours			2
it was essential that his eyes and lips were kept lubricated in order to prevent his eyes from scarring and his lips from fusing together			0
finally , after three weeks in hospital , @entity6 was well enough to return home in october 2013			2
his mother said : ' we just prayed he would pull through			0
our friends and family helped out as we spent all of the time we could by his side			0
' when i could hug him for the first time , it was the best feeling ever			0
we 'd come so close to losing him , and i never wanted to let him go			0
' he was still very poorly , but we knew that we were over the worst of it			0
' @entity6 quickly settled back into family life with his little sister , @entity170 , two , and soon began to recover			1
although he still has scarring and now suffers from asthma , he has fully recovered and recently enjoyed his first week back at school			2
ms @entity42 said : ' it 's brilliant to see @entity6 so happy again , and his dad and i are so proud of him			2
' he 's on a new medication for his epilepsy , which he 's responding really well to			0
' his little sister @entity170 has also taken to making sure he 's not poorly again			0
she dresses up as a doctor and prods him with a stethoscope to make sure everything 's working properly			0
' i 'm so grateful that doctors were able to treat @entity6 in time			1
now we 're looking forward to the future as a happy , healthy family			0

' @entity64 is more common in adults , but can occur at any age , including children			0
' it involves the skin and the mucous membranes - including the lips , mouth and eyes - and is closely related to a condition called toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) , which causes large areas of skin to die and is often fatal without treatment			1
' fortunately with expert medical and nursing help , many patients survive @entity64			0
however , it is essential for the patient never to take the culprit drug again as long as they live , otherwise there is a very high risk of an even worse reaction			2
