the administrator overseeing the crisis at @entity2 fears the team will not be competing in next weekend 's @entity5 @entity4			1
@entity6 , who represents @entity8 accountancy firm @entity7 , says he is doing all he can to get the team on the grid at @entity11			2
but he has been left ' distressed ' and frustrated by some of the practices he has so far encountered behind the scenes at @entity2			1
staff are locked out of @entity2 headquarters in @entity17 , @entity18 , for a second consecutive day the administrator overseeing the crisis fears they will not compete at the @entity5 grand prix next weekend the gates at the team 's @entity17 factory are locked for a second day and the team 's cars remain impounded , so hopes are fading fast that @entity2 will be heading to @entity29			1
@entity6 is working on behalf of the creditors of @entity31 , a company which makes and supplies the cars to @entity33 , the entity which owns the licence to race in @entity36			2
' i 'm constantly chasing @entity33 - it should be the other way around - to engage better with me , ' @entity6 told @entity38			2
' i can only presume they have other issues going on , but i really need them to come to me with an acceptable figure ( to offer their creditors ) so they can gain access again to @entity17 and we can support them			2
' it 's very important to us they race , very important			1
but the thing is , for the creditors of @entity31 , it 's not up to them to fund racing			1
there are around 200 jobs at the headquarters that could be lost if a resolution to the situation is not found @entity2 in action during practice at the @entity4 in @entity60 in october ' @entity36 is a rich man 's game , as we know , so ( @entity64 ) need to fund themselves and pay their way			1
' i 'm responsible to my creditors , i 'm an officer of the court , i need to make things better for them			0
' at the moment @entity64 are trying to get me to make things worse for them , which i 'm not willing to do			0
' with practice in @entity11 just a week away , it was suggested to @entity6 that given the present situation @entity2 would not be there			1
@entity6 replied : ' no , no. i 've some meetings there as well - i hope @entity77 are there			0
' former @entity2 owner @entity79 ( above ) claims not to have been paid for his shares of ownership in the background is the mud - slinging dispute between the past and present owners of @entity2			1
@entity85 entrepreneur @entity79 claims he has yet to be paid for the shares of ownership , while the buyers in a consortium of @entity91 and @entity92 businessmen who took over at the end of june insist everything has been done accordingly			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , has made it abundantly clear who he feels he should be dealing with - @entity97 , who initially served as an advisor to the consortium , but is now the man in charge			0
' they tell me @entity97 is the principal of @entity33			0
to say @entity79 runs it is totally untrue , ' stated @entity6			1
' there is a legal dispute as to who owns the shares of @entity64 , but @entity97 and his people run the @entity77 team , and he is the principal			0
' @entity79 vented his frustration via @entity112 on wednesday about the current situation at @entity2 @entity6 , however , has been left amazed by the fact @entity97 has yet to make contact , adding : ' i 've spoken to some of his people			1
' but it would be no harm if he phoned me as well because i 've not spoken to him once so far			0
' overnight i reached out to ( @entity77 supremo ) @entity121 to see if he can assist in some way because it 's in everybody 's best interests to do something			2
' i 'm told @entity97 wants to go racing ; i want my creditors to get some money , and @entity121 clearly wants them to be on the grid			0
' you would think there is the makings of a deal there , but overnight i 've chased @entity33 , and i 've heard nothing back from them			0
' as for the 200 - plus staff whose jobs are on the line , @entity6 was given a taste of the problems they face on thursday when he made the tough call to close the gates on the factory			0
@entity60 @entity148 driver @entity147 crashes out of the @entity150 grand prix in march ' i spoke to the head of @entity152 earlier , and it 's quite unfortunate @entity33 do n't have an out - of - hours communication system , ' said @entity6			1
' i was quite distressed @entity33 were unable to tell their employees not to go , so people travelled , only to be sent away at the gates			2
i tried to avoid that			0
' but @entity64 did n't have the wherewithal to organise otherwise			0
' we 've told people that once we do an acceptable deal then they will be straight back in			0
