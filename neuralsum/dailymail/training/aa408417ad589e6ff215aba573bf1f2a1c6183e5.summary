by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 11 february 2013 hungry councillors are set to lose their cheap bacon rolls after it was revealed that they were costing more than £ 122,000 of taxpayers ' money a year			1
@entity7 city council chiefs will axe the subsidised buffet in the elegant @entity10 dining room to make way for a new commercial cafe			1
they have been under pressure for years to give up the silver - service restaurant in @entity15 , where they eat cheaply thanks to £ 122,000 - a - year subsidy from the city 's ancient , but depleted , @entity20			1
@entity21 , outside @entity10 , says her council colleagues should pay for food and drink the fund , which was supposedly set up for the good of the city , had been used to foot the bill for the dining room because it provided ' training ' for the local authority 's catering and services firm , @entity33			1
now the council 's @entity35 leaders have caved to pressure to give up the publicly - funded service , announcing plans to close it			1
city treasurer @entity40 said : ' the buffet belongs to another era			2
it is no longer the best way to provide either catering for the @entity10 or training for @entity48 's young staff			0
we asked @entity48 to put together a fresh approach			0
' it will be open to everyone in the building and run on a commercial basis , at no cost to the city			2
' @entity48 already runs similar cafes in some of our other offices , such as @entity59 , which have been a success			0
' @entity21 , an opposition @entity61 councillor , discovered none of the kitchen staff were qualified trainers and said the facility was a waste of common good money			0
going : subsidised bacon rolls for @entity7 city councillors cost taxpayers more than £ 10,000 a monthh @entity72 , who takes tea to work in a flask rather than enjoy free , subsidised hot drinks , said : ' i think the buffet is an anachronism : i do n't see why anybody should subsidise my dinners or anybody else 's			1
' i 'm glad the buffet will be replaced by a cafe that everyone who works can use			2
' councillors ate for free in the buffet until 2007 when they started earning a salary			0
since then , they have made a modest contribution to the cost - in theory they pay for the ingredients while meals are cooked as a training exercise			0
a two - course meal is currently £ 3.50 , with another £ 1 for a pudding , while coffee and tea is free			0
the buffet is also open for breakfasts , with a roll and sausage on the menu for 90p , and a roll and bacon for £ 1			0
ms @entity21 said : ' the only place i know where you can eat as cheaply as that is a truck stop			0
and i should say the quality would not be the same			0
' a source at @entity10 said the 48 - table dining room had fallen out of favour , serving only around 25 customers a day out of 79 councillors and the city 's senior directors , while another source suggested the figure was closer to 12			1
@entity119 leader @entity118 said : ' closing the council buffet and turning it into a commercial cafe is a good decision			1
' the current level of subsidy is not justifiable and the training benefits can be met through a commercial cafe , which will offer the kind of catering most staff want			2
' it is not clear when the buffet will be shut down , but councillors have already approved a subsidy of £ 122,000 from the @entity20 for the 2013 - 14 financial year .			1

@entity136 's silver - service buffet is funded by public money
councillors ' cheap food costs city 's @entity20 £ 122,000 a year
*labour* council leaders have given in to pressure to stop subsidised food
new commercial cafe where everyone pays full price will replace old one
