the council ’s @entity44 leader @entity43 quit his position when the report was published			2
the prime minister has led calls for mr @entity1 to go , but he has stubbornly refused to quit his £ 85,000 a year job and is due to appear before the @entity50 today			1
the latest allegations come from an abuse victim who said he had been given detailed accounts of the shocking crimes in face - to - face meetings with victims more than eight years ago			1
the sex - grooming victim told the @entity58 : ‘ he seemed genuinely shocked			0
he talked like he was going to go away and see that something was done , but we never saw him again			0
it was the end of it for him , but not for us			0
‘ i sat two feet from him and told him really , really private things			1
i do n’t know how he can go on national television and say he was n’t aware , that he didn ’ t know anything about it			1
for years they had all the reports and information , but they just ignored it			0
’ previously mr @entity1 said he was aware child exploitation was happening in @entity11 , but he did n’t realise it was taking place on an ‘ industrial scale			1
’ he also admitted meeting victims and became ‘ more aware that there was a problem			0
’ mr @entity1 has been keeping a low - profile since the fallout over professor @entity35 ’s report led to widespread calls for his resignation			1
resigned : yesterday @entity28 ( above ) , @entity11 council ’s chief executive , announced he was quitting his £ 160,000 a year job in december ' to enable the town to recover ' under new leadership he is to give evidence at the @entity92 along with chief constable @entity93 and @entity11 ’s social services boss @entity94 , who have also been widely criticised			2
