ahead of kick - off at @entity2 , @entity0 tweeted a picture of @entity5 ’s shirt hanging up in the visitors ’ dressing room			1
after another defeat in the @entity12 - their seventh of the season - the @entity0 captain could not get out of this place quick enough			1
last march , when the club were challenging for the title , he scored twice in a 3 - 0 victory here at @entity2 to maintain the momentum			1
is this really happening ? afraid so , @entity39			0
@entity40 will tell you that his team dominated possession and should have got something out of @entity0 ’s biggest game of the season			1
the body language of the players will tell you differently			0
this is a dysfunctional mob , a group of players slung together over the summer and asked to repeat last season ’s extraordinary feats			0
there is no chance of that now , not after the manner and the conviction of this defeat by their oldest rivals in @entity64 football			0
who knows what @entity0 are aiming for now and it will only be magnified when the draw for the last 32 of the @entity69 takes places again			2
they have the feel of a category b club again			0
this @entity0 dressing room is split , divided in their approach after failing to finish second behind @entity75 in their @entity77 group			1
‘ i would n’t tell if there have been issues , we keep that sort of thing internal , ’ claimed @entity40			1
it feels like it is out in the open anyhow			0
@entity0 ’s defence was all over the place at times here , cowed into a corner by the brilliance of @entity25 , @entity29 and the extremely fortunate @entity90			2
@entity0 manager @entity40 reacts during his side 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity20 @entity93 ( left ) was repeatedly denied by the excellent performance of @entity95 ( right ) @entity93 crashed to the ground and looked devastated by the result as the full - time whistle was blown @entity99 ( left ) managed to keep @entity100 ( right ) waiting for his first @entity0 @entity12 goal here at @entity2 we perhaps witnessed a @entity0 team look disaffected and done in for the first time in living memory			1
the decision to play @entity107 ahead of @entity108 - admittedly no great shakes this season - clearly disrupted the @entity0 defence			1
so did the switch to 3 - 4 - 3 , without a main striker and a load of work on the training ground in the days leading up to the game			1
@entity0 ’s confidence is shot , summed up by the decision - making and their failure to show any sign of cohesion or spirit out there			2
at 20 , @entity93 believes he has earned a contract on a par with the big boys after a decent finish to last season that ended with a place in the @entity132 squad			0
talented boy he is , but he was denied three times here by @entity20 ’s brilliant keeper @entity95			2
on each occasion , you backed @entity95			0
@entity107 , brought in to replace @entity108 in goal , was wrong - footed when @entity25 put @entity20 in to an early lead			2
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity107 ( left ) replaced @entity108 but had a torrid afternoon for @entity0 @entity100 could have had a hat - trick for @entity0 but was denied brilliantly three times by @entity99 @entity25 ( left ) , who scored @entity20 's first goal , protects the ball from the attention of @entity5 ( right ) neither did @entity5 , the man caught out of position when he was dragged to the ball by the sight of @entity148 bounding down the right wing			1
@entity25 , his opposite number for the day in the boiler room , swept in @entity20 ’s first			1
after that there was no way back for @entity0			2
what has happened to @entity5 ? he is a tormented soul again , wishing away the season after @entity40 confirmed again that his team is in transition			1
even at the start of the second half , when you normally expect @entity5 to be showing some emotion and stirring his team - mates before kick - off , he was quiet and subdued			1
then there was @entity100 , brought on at the start of the second half to replace @entity167			0
he could have had a hat - trick			0
he was denied , just like @entity93 , by the brilliance of @entity170 in @entity20 ’s goal			2
beating the @entity172 from close range is a formidable task these days			0
@entity175 ( left ) tussles for possession with @entity5 in the @entity12 game at @entity2 @entity5 cut a dejected figure as he walked off the pitch at @entity2 following his side 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity20 after this it is all about saving @entity0 ’s season and @entity40 must come up with some more answers this week			1
the trip to @entity189 on wednesday for a @entity191 tie against @entity193 leaders @entity187 is full of pitfalls			0
@entity196 ’s team scored five against @entity197 and will fancy their chances of another scalp against @entity0			0
after that it is on to @entity201 , the team they beat 5 - 1 at @entity203 last season			0
this time , it feels like they are hanging on .			0

@entity0 were easily swept aside 3 - 0 at @entity2 by @entity20
the result heaps more **pressure** on @entity0 manager @entity40
@entity5 appeared quiet and subdued as @entity20 ran out winners
