by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter the cicadas invasion of the @entity4 has begun , with the insects spotted everywhere from @entity6 to @entity7			1
the infestation , named @entity9 by scientists , has not been seen since 1996			1
before that it last appeared in 1979			2
so far the majority of sightings have been in @entity6 and other southern states , where some people have found hundreds in their backyards accompanied by the insects ' loud chorus call			1

cicadas are expected to emerge from the ground in the billions in the next couple of weeks as soil temperature reaches 64 degrees @entity40			1
for weeks , bug - watchers have been posting their sightings ( and soil temperature readings ) to websites such as @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity48 's @entity47			1
the emergence of the insects has been slower than expected due to this spring 's cool temperatures in northern states , reports @entity53			1
cicadas invasion : the insects have been spotted everywhere from @entity6 to @entity7 @entity48 's online trader is documenting sightings of cicadas up and down the @entity4 in order to bring the soil up to 64 degrees f , air temperatures have to get significantly higher than that on a consistent basis			1
they do not bite or sting , and will not harm crops or other animals			2
lots of people will not even see them , though they could certainly hear their mating call , which was once recorded at 94 decibels			2
and the insects can even be transformed into a high protein , low - carb meal			2
the magicicadas are only after sex			2
after a few weeks up singing their loud mating call up in the trees , they will die and their offspring will go underground , not to return until 2030			2
since 1996 , this group of one - inch bugs , has been a few feet underground , sucking on tree roots and biding their time			2
they will emerge only when the ground temperature reaches precisely 64f			2
the cicadas have been living underground for 17 years and will emerge when the ground temperature hits @entity89 the cicadas , seen here in @entity92 , shed their shells and spread their wings before finding a mate the recipe book by @entity97 , below , can be found here			1
the recipes include : @entity47 dumplings @entity101 tacos cica - delicious pizza sizzling chili cicadas @entity105 cicada tartlets banana cicada bread chocolate chip trillers cicada - rhubarb piece and , ms @entity97 's favourite , chocolate covered cicadas ' this particular brood is extremely large ' , pest controller @entity112 told @entity115 , who saw a swarm at a farm in @entity119			1
' i 've never seen so many in one location in my life			2
they were on almost every blade of grass			2
' a recipe book by scientist @entity97 advocates collecting the creatures for food - though not without consulting a doctor first , and not if you suffer from a nut or shellfish allergy			0
she told @entity133 that about 8pm to 9pm is the prime time for cicada gathering			0
' you 're going to look at the low - lying shrubs on the ground , ' she said			0
' you 're probably going to need a lot because they 're great			0
' ms @entity141 , who wrote the book during her phd at the @entity144 and now works for the @entity146 department of agriculture , advised grabbing the magicicadas off bushes and putting them into a paper bag or basket			1
' newly hatched cicadas , called tenerals , are considered best for eating because their shells have not hardened , ' says the book			1
' they should be blanched ( for 4 - 5 minutes ) soon after collection and before you eat them ! ' not only will this make their insides solidify a bit , but it will get rid of any soil bacteria that is living on or in them			0
you can then cook with them immediately , or freeze them			0
' the insects are expected to arrive in such numbers that people from @entity92 to @entity172 will be outnumbered roughly 600 - to - 1			1
' it 's just an amazing accomplishment , ' @entity173 , a @entity174 entomologist , told the @entity177			0
' how can anyone not be impressed ? ' there are ordinary cicadas that come out every year around the world , but these are different			1
this year 's group of nagicicadas is known as @entity9 and has begun to emerge on the @entity4 of the @entity146 the insects do not sting or bite and pose no threat to humans or crops they are called magicicadas - as in magic - and are red - eyed			1
and they are seen only in the eastern half of the @entity146			1
there are 15 @entity146 broods that emerge every 13 or 17 years			1
last year the swarm affected only a small area , mostly around the @entity198 of @entity6 , @entity6 and @entity199			1
next year , it is the turn of @entity201 into @entity202 and @entity203 ; and @entity204 and @entity205			0
@entity9 is one of the bigger groups			1
several experts say that they do n't know how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30billion seems like a sensible estimate			1
at the @entity213 , researcher @entity212 said it could be closer to a trillion			0
if 30billion magicicadas were lined up head to tail , they would reach the moon and back			0
' there will be some places where it 's wall - to - wall cicadas , ' says @entity144 entomologist @entity223			1
strength in numbers is the key to cicada survival : there are so many of them that the birds ca n't possibly eat them all , and those that are left over are free to multiply , he says			0
some scientists think the magicicadas come out in the odd 13 and 17 - year cycles so that predators can not match the timing and be waiting for them in huge numbers			0
another theory is that the unusual cycles ensure that different broods do n't compete with each other			0
and there 's the mystery of just how these bugs know it has been 17 years and is time to come out , instead of 15 or 16 years			0
' these guys have evolved several mathematically clever tricks , ' @entity223 says			0
' these guys are geniuses with little tiny brains			0
' while they stay underground , the bugs are n't asleep			0
as some of the world 's longest - lived insects , they go through different growth stages and molt four times before ever getting to the surface			1
they feed on a tree fluid called xylem			0
then they surface , where they molt , leaving behind a crusty brown shell , and grow a half - inch bigger			1
as six - year - old @entity269 shows , the cicadas are harmless @entity269 has already encountered her first magicicada - and scientists say there could be between 30billion and a trillion of the insects waiting to surface the timing of when they first come out depends purely on ground temperature			1
that means early may for southern areas and late may or even june for northern areas			2
the males come out first as nymphs , which are essentially wingless and silent juveniles , then climb on to tree branches and molt one last time , becoming adult winged cicadas			2
they perch on tree branches and sing , individually or in a chorus			0
then when a female comes close , the males change their song , they do a dance and mate , @entity223 explained			0
the males keep mating and eventually the female lays 600 or so eggs on the tip of a branch			0
the offspring then dive - bomb out of the trees , bounce off the ground and eventually burrow into the earth , he says			0
' it 's a treacherous , precarious life , ' @entity223 says			0
' but somehow they make it work			0

cicadas have begun to surface across the @entity4 of the @entity146
so far the majority of sightings have been in @entity6 and other southern states
further north the weather has been too cool but the emergence of @entity9 emergence is n’t expected to be too far away
