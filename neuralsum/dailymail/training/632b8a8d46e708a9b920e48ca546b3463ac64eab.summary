@entity0 will ditch @entity2 ’s policy of signing players en masse as he bids to bring in the ‘ quality ’ which will bump them up the @entity7 running order			1
the @entity2 have made 18 permanent signings in the last 18 months – the bulk of which came under the disastrous tenure of @entity13 – but only six of those remain part of the first - team picture			1
in addition , loan arrivals such as @entity19 and @entity20 have failed to impact and it has instead been long - serving players such as @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 who have kept the team clear of danger			1
@entity0 ( above ) has hinted at a change in @entity2 's policy of signing new players but with five goalless draws already this season – the most in the @entity35 – @entity0 concedes that he needs to add some attacking flair come january			1
when asked about the run of appearing at the tail end of @entity7 , he said : ‘ not in a million years would i be happy going out in each game to earn a point			2
‘ we need to win			0
we need to score , we need to play better , we need to be more clinical and create more chances			0
’ in order to achieve that , @entity0 is targeting offensive additions in the @entity45 , with former loanee @entity46 again on the radar amid his struggle for first - team football at @entity50			1
loan arrivals @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 have had little impact since joining the club former @entity2 loanee @entity46 ( left ) is back on @entity0 's radar the @entity54 – whose 14th - placed side entertain @entity57 , in fourth , on saturday afternoon - added : ‘ it 's quality or nothing , not quantity			1
quantity at this club is finished			0
‘ we 're not signing quantity any more			0
i do n't want any more , “ maybe if in three months ’ time ( they will come good ) ”			1
there were too many of those in the last three years and in the end the team suffers			0
you ca n't progress with too many changes			1
‘ the more players we bring in to certain positions , the better and easier it will be for me			0
we 're not playing even 50 per cent of the way i want			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 will come up against son @entity76 for the first time at the @entity78 on saturday			1
the 19 - year - old signed for the @entity57 from @entity80 during the summer and has been involved with @entity82 ’s senior side this season			0
@entity0 will come up against his son @entity76 for the first time when @entity57 visit the @entity78 @entity0 , though , has cut all contact to his boy for fear of compromising his loyalty			1
‘ i 'm trying to stay away from him so there 's no misunderstandings or any kind of doubts , ’ he said			2
‘ it 's not nice but it 's only for a few days , it 's not like i 'm not going to talk to him anymore			2
‘ i think it 's better not to call him or for him to call me			2
i think it 's clear that it would have been uncomfortable for him as well , even a joke can be taken the wrong way			2
‘ maybe he could read something into me asking a harmless question like “ what have you done today ? ”			0
‘ today , i do n't care how he does , i do n't care			2
we say in @entity113 there are no friends on the pitch and no family ties either			0
after the game , we 're fine , but during it , no. ’			0
