by @entity0 published : 07:53 est , 25 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:41 est , 25 february 2014 with her neat blonde hair and shoulder - grazing earrings , @entity3 does n't look particularly intimidating but to @entity8 's crack dealers , that 's exactly what she is			1
@entity10 has the biggest crack problem in the world , with drugs worth 10 million dollars sold every single day and addicts on every corner in the country 's slums and shanty towns			1
worse , the crack epidemic has led to spiralling crime rates with murder rates on the increase as drug dons compete for their share of the lucrative trade			2
battle : lawyer @entity3 is fighting to persuade @entity8 's drug barons to stop selling crack cocaine dangerous : @entity3 is a regular visitor to some of @entity8 's most dangerous favelas where she meets drug dons @entity3 , however , is one of a growing number of @entity10 with plans to to something about the crack epidemic and says the government should start taking it more seriously			1
currently , the @entity10 government 's solution to the crack problem is to ' pacify ' the favelas - using the police and army to drive out the dealers and addicts - but so far , only in 30 , all in tourist areas , out of 1000 , has the policy been implemented			1
' crack here in @entity8 is treated like a security risk rather than the public health issue it is , ' she explains			1
' without a doubt there is a policy of social cleansing			0
all they are doing is sweeping dirt under the carpet			0
the @entity59 legacy in @entity10 will be an army of zombie crack users			1
' most of @entity8 's addicts are concentrated in the favelas and in these ' crack lands ' can be seen openly smoking the drug on the street			1
but while the dealers are lining their pockets , for those addicted to the drug , the only thing crack produces is misery			2
seedy : @entity10 police have ' pacified ' 30 of @entity8 's 1,000 slums - all 30 are in tourist areas disgusting : @entity78 in front of one of the many piles of rubbish that @entity8 's crack addicts live and work in ' i 'm here looking for my son , he 's a crack user , ' says one woman who was filmed entering the favela in her sunday best for @entity78 's @entity90			1
' i have been struggling with this for five years , all because of this godforsaken crack			2
lots of mothers go through this			0
' it hurts when i see them like this sleeping rough , covered in mud , dirty and hungry , i wo n't give up , he 's my son , i ca n't abandon him			2
' i have roses as a pledge , i put them in church for him , i love my son so much			0
i have faith in my @entity106 , i will see my son transformed			0
' addict : ' sometimes i do n't sleep at all , ' says crack user @entity108 , who does n't use his name for safety reasons pacification : a crack addict , centre , reacts as a social worker tries to calm her during a raid in one favela @entity3 , meanwhile has focused her efforts on persuading the drug barons , many of whom are clients represented by her law firm , to give up selling crack			1
' we are here on a mission to give drug dealers a conscience , to get them to stop selling crack , ' she tells @entity78 as they wander through one of the unpacified favelas			1
' the motivation to change this problem has to come from their own experience because a lot of these drug dealers have relatives who use crack so it 's very real for them			1
they see the destruction that crack causes in the community			0
' on the other hand there is of course the issue of profit which is why we have n't yet stopped the sale of crack			0
' and her fears appear to be borne out			0
filmed meeting with one of the drug dons , she is told , in no uncertain terms , that if he does n't sell crack , someone else will			2
no country for young boys : a young drug dealer sitting on a chair holds a weapon and a two - way radio no help : an alleged crack addict , second from right , tries to bite a social worker as she is taken away ' the problem is that we rely on this , ' he adds			1
' i earn $ 10,000 a month but the average salary is $ 160			0
he adds : ' you have to explain that that as long as there 's corruption , this wo n't stop			2
corruption in this country is shameless			0
they hide behind masks , they hide behind everything			0
we line their pockets and they leave us to sell			0
' @entity3 herself hopes that the dealers will eventually give up selling crack - even if that means switching to selling other drugs instead			1
' i 'm not condoning drugs , ' she adds			0
' i think all drugs are bad			0
' but with six million @entity10 adults willing to admit they 've tried the substance , it 's clear that something needs to be done about @entity10 's crack epidemic			1
@entity3 appears on @entity78 : @entity203 , tonight at 9pm on @entity204			2

@entity3 is a human rights lawyer taking on @entity8 's drug lords
hopes to persuade them to stop selling crack - even if they sell other drugs
