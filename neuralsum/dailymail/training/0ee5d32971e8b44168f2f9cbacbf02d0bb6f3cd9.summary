@entity1 , 24 , is standing trial for manslaughter after baby @entity3 , known as @entity14 , died because of injuries caused by ‘ deliberate and violent shaking , ’ @entity11 heard today			1
@entity14 ’s mother @entity17 , 26 , waved goodbye to her ‘ giggling ’ baby as she left him with @entity1 for a few hours on june 14 last year			1
the woman from @entity22 , @entity20 returned home to discover that @entity14 had been rushed to hospital suffering from a swollen brain and extensive internal bleeding			1
he later died of his injuries and experts who examined him say they could not have been the result of an accident			0
@entity1 , of @entity11 , @entity20 , claims he picked the baby up and put him on his chest and when he fell asleep , @entity14 fell to the floor			1
he denied harming the baby and insisted what happened was a ‘ complete accident ’			0
prosecutor @entity37 told the court : ‘ this defendant killed a baby who was just nine - months - old			2
‘ we say he did that by deliberately shaking that child violently , or it may have been a violent shake and throwing down onto a soft surface such as a sofa or a mattress			0
‘ as a result of this conduct the child died			0
it was not an accidental fall or gentle or more rigorous shaking that killed @entity14 but deliberate and violent shaking in which it must have been obvious that shaking would cause some injury , even if he would not have supposed that it would cause death			2
’ the court was told @entity1 moved in with @entity14 and his mother at the end of march 2011 after she split with the child ’s father , @entity63 , 27			1
miss @entity17 left @entity14 at home when she went out in her car at 11:45am with her other son , @entity67 , 3			1
at 1:05pm @entity1 rang 999 to report that @entity14 had somehow ‘ fallen off his chest ’ while he slept in a chair and was ‘ barely responsive ’			1
appearing for the prosecution , miss @entity17 told the court : ‘ i had got up and fed both of the kids and @entity74 was having a lay in			0
‘ at about 11am i woke @entity74 up and asked him if he would help me to take some stuff out of the car			0
‘ he said to me do n’t worry about doing that and that he would look after @entity14 and i should go with @entity67			2
‘ just before i left @entity14 he was giggling and kicking his feet and @entity74 had taken him out of his bouncer and he was waving at me and @entity67 from the window			1
’ a ' complete accident ' : in @entity11 ( pictured ) , @entity1 claimed he picked the baby up and put him on his chest and when he fell asleep , the boy , known as @entity14 , fell to the floor the court heard that when @entity89 returned , she was told by a neighbour @entity14 had been taken to hospital			1
mr @entity37 said : ‘ he says that @entity14 was in the rocker and apparently smiled at him , so he took the child out of the rocker and put him on his chest			1
‘ he told police and doctors that they both fell asleep and he woke up suddenly to find that @entity14 was on the floor , his eyes were half open and he was making a gargling noise but not moving			2
‘ he then said @entity14 was vomiting and he picked him up , he pinched his fingers and lightly slapped his face to get a reaction , then he shook him gently			2
‘ after this did not work he splashed him with bath water before calling 999			0
’ the jury was played a harrowing recording of the 999 call made by @entity1 on the day @entity14 died			1
they heard @entity1 trying to perform cpr with the advice of the operator , before remarking : ‘ he ’s got bubbles coming out of his mouth			2
‘ it is coming out of his nose too , he is looking straight at me - he is looking as if he ’s not even alive			0
’ during the 20 minute call , he was heard saying ‘ oh my @entity122 , ’ and pleading with the baby , saying ‘ come on , come on boy , come on boy , ’ and ‘ come on @entity14 ’			2
he also told the operator @entity125 simply ‘ fell off of him while he was asleep ’			0
@entity1 then panicked , saying : ‘ he ’s going cold now , seriously , what should i do with him now ? ‘ he ’s gone floppy and he ’s cold , seriously , i think he might die , i think he ’s going to die			0
’ @entity127 , the first paramedic on the scene , told the court how @entity1 showed her how he shook little @entity130			0
emergency call : paramedics rushed to the scene after @entity1 called 999 and @entity14 was airlifted to the @entity134 ( pictured ) where he was later pronounced dead she said : ‘ the one thing i remember is the fact that he said he had shaken the baby to try and wake him up			1
‘ i remember him saying he may have been asleep with the baby and his arm fell away and the baby fell down			1
‘ we were in the car and he put both hands in front of him and said he shook the baby to try and wake him up			0
’ referring to her statement she said : ‘ i ’ve described the action as not vigorous but enough to make the baby ’s head go back and forward			0
’ after paramedics raced to the scene , @entity14 was airlifted to the @entity134 where he was later pronounced dead			0
the court heard how pathologists found no evidence that @entity14 died of natural causes as he was found to have haemorrhaged retinas and brain damage			1
police arrested @entity1 and took him in for questioning but he stood by his account of what happened			0
