avian cholera is thought to have killed at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in @entity4 while migrating to nesting grounds on the northern coast of @entity7 , wildlife managers said monday			1
dozens of @entity9 ( @entity10 ) workers and volunteers over the weekend retrieved and incinerated carcasses of snow geese found near bodies of water and a wildlife management area in the eastern part of the state , said agency spokesman @entity20			1
illness ? avian cholera is suspected in the deaths of at least 2,000 snow geese that fell dead from the sky in @entity4 , like the one seen here avian cholera is believed to be the culprit in the deaths mostly because of the way the birds died , he said			1
' basically , they just fell out of the sky , ' @entity20 said			0
he said biologists were awaiting results from a state wildlife lab to confirm the birds died of the highly contagious disease , which is caused by bacteria that can survive in soil and water for up to four months			0
humans face a small risk of contracting the disease but the more immediate threat is to wildlife in the vicinity of contaminated carcasses , @entity20 said			1
about 20 bald eagles were seen near areas where snow geese carcasses littered the ground but a lengthy incubation period makes it unclear if the eagles were infected and would carry the ailment elsewhere , said @entity20			2
it was not known where the snow geese – named for their white plumage and for breeding in the far northern corners of @entity7 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 – contracted avian cholera during a migration that saw them wing north from wintering grounds in the @entity65 and @entity66 , he said			1
outbreaks like the one found affecting the migrating snow geese in @entity4 occur periodically in the @entity69 and elsewhere , @entity20 said			1
@entity70 said in a monday news release ' the carcasses of a small number of snow geese were first reported at @entity75 near @entity76 , @entity4			1
closer inspection on friday found higher numbers of dead birds at the @entity80 near @entity81 , @entity4 and a lesser amount at @entity83 near @entity84 , @entity4			2
' @entity86 supervisor @entity85 said in the release that avian cholera has appeared before			2
' outbreaks of avian cholera have occurred sporadically in the region over the past few decades , ' he said			0
@entity85 also said that ' the important thing is to quickly collect as many of the carcasses as possible , to prevent other birds from feeding on the infected birds			0
' the @entity10 said anyone who sees dead birds should not touch them , and contact the @entity98 by dialing 208 - 525 - 7290			0
avian cholera is the most important infectious disease affecting wild waterfowl in @entity102 , according to the @entity103			1
' @entity105 may be so rapid that birds literally fall out of the sky or die while eating with no previous signs of disease , ' the agency said of the disease on its website			0
' @entity113 birds appear lethargic , and when captured may die within minutes			0
' it said that infected birds may swim in circles , experience convulsions , swim in circles , fly upside down , exhibit mucous discharge from their mouths , have blood - stained or yellow droppings , and display soiled or matted feathers on parts of the body			0
