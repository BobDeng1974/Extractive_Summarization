president @entity0 claimed on monday that without a comprehensive budget covering the @entity3 , more than 130,000 mission - critical employees will be forced to work without pay by the end of the month			1
they include 40,000 employed by @entity7 , 50,000 @entity9 screeners , 13,000 @entity10 agents and 40,000 @entity13 personnel			0
pay would be restored at the end of any withholding period			2
' i know how vital you are , and i want to make sure more @entity19 know how vital you are , ' @entity0 told an auditorium full of @entity3 employees monday the department 's headquarters , as the @entity24 rolled out his $ 4 trillion budget request for 2016			1
in addition , it 's likely that 4,000 people who work for the @entity29 will see paychecks on hold if @entity0 does n't strike a deal with @entity33 in @entity34			1
annual tradition : journalists photographed copies of the president 's budget proposal , which is considered a dead letter in @entity34 ' the men and women of @entity19 's homeland security apparatus do important work to protect us , and @entity33 and @entity58 in @entity34 should not be playing politics with them , ' he added			1
republicans agreed in december to fund most of the government through september 2015 , but put @entity62 on a shorter leash in order to keep their leverage as @entity0 threatened to implement sweeping changes to @entity19 's immigration enforcement policy			1
@entity3 ’s funding runs out in less than four weeks , and could be stopped entirely if @entity0 continues to pursue his plan to give residence and work permits to 5 million or more illegal immigrants			1
@entity33 leadership calls the plan ' executive amnesty , ' and insists that @entity34 – not the @entity24 – has sole authority to determine who may and may not legally stay in the @entity19			1
the president pushed back on monday as he rolled out the larger budget designed to get @entity19 through september 2016			1
that budget would add $ 474 billion to the national debt			0
' i will not accept a budget that severs the vital links between our national security and our economic security , ' @entity0 said			2
' those two things go hand in hand , ' he insisted			0
but that budget is likely dead on arrival since he is proposing higher taxes on wealthier @entity19 and job - creating companies			0
' like the president ’s previous budgets , this plan never balances – ever , ' house speaker @entity97 said monday morning			2
' it contains no solutions to address the drivers of our debt , and no plan to fix our entire tax code to help foster growth and create jobs			0
' ' worse yet , president @entity0 would impose new taxes and more spending without a responsible plan to honestly address the big challenges facing our country			1
' @entity97 pledged that he would present a balanced budget that ' will help promote job creation and higher wages , not more government bureaucracy			0
' in the @entity119 , majority leader @entity118 charged that @entity0 's budget is a ' top - down , backward - looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the @entity124			1
' @entity0 's budget includes an unprecedented $ 478 billion public works program that promises to repair crumbling highways , bridges and public transit systems , largely by providing jobs to @entity58 ' powerful labor union constituency			1
its tax rate on capital gains – investment income – would be the highest in @entity19 since 1997			0
the president is demanding a 7 per cent increase in domestic spending and the defense budget , undoing the fiscal restraint that marked the 2011 budget deal			2
@entity0 called those cuts ' mindless austerity			2
' on monday he quoted an unnamed @entity33 whom he said had insisted that if @entity3 funding were on hold , ' it 's not the end of the world			1
' ' i guess that 's literally that 's true , ' the president said			2
' it may not be the end of the world			0
but unril they pass a funding bill , it is the end of a paycheck for tens of thousands of front - line workers who will continue to have to work without getting paid			1
' that was different from what he said last week in @entity162 , when he implied that the department would actually shut down its operations in the wake of a budget impasse			0
@entity167 politics : @entity0 warned @entity3 workers that they might have to wait for their salaries after february 27 ' what do you mean , " it 's not the @entity173 " ? ' @entity0 said on jan. 29			1
' that ’s all you ’ve been talking about			0
and now , suddenly , because you want to make a political point , you think that we can afford to have the @entity3 not functioning – because of political games in @entity42 ? ' the @entity33 congressman who said it would n't be ' the @entity173 , ' @entity179 's @entity178 , was referring to the fact that critical functions would n't stop			1
' it 's not the end of the world if we get to that time because the national security functions will not stop – whether it 's border security or a lot of other issues , ' @entity178 had told @entity191			0
' having said so , i think we should always aspire to try to get it done			0
' @entity0 was chastened by @entity195 website , which declared that he had ' fudged facts in @entity162			2
' so on monday he focused instead on a temporary stoppage of paychecks , the same phenomenon employees across all cabinet agencies saw in 2013			0
' these @entity19 are n't just working to keep us safe , ' he said			0
' they have to take care of their own families			0
the notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense			0

@entity0 warned @entity33 against holding @entity3 funding *hostage* as they fight him on sweeping immigration policy changes that he made on his own
president said critical @entity3 workers will have to work without pay after february 27 if there 's no deal for the department 's funding
republicans funded the rest of the government through september but put @entity62 on a tighter leash
@entity0 moved last year to *unilaterally* change immigration policy and *guarantee* no *deportations* for 5 million illegal immigrants
