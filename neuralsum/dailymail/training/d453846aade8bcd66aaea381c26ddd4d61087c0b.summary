‘ different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures , and we all have a favourite strength			0

’ the @entity3 keeps the beverage warm for up to 60 minutes and can also be used as a conventional kettle or to brew coffee			1
it is part of the new sage by @entity4 range that includes an ice cream maker and a juicer			2

luxury : the new @entity4 range also includes a precision toaster for £ 169.99 the @entity4 toaster includes a quick look button which triggers the machine to lift the bread out to show whether it is done or not			1
if it not quite golden , pressing the ‘ a bit more ’ button lowers it back in for another 30 seconds			0
there are independent controls to allow two different toasting settings , a one - touch automatic lowering system , an led light progress display , a toast ready sound alert , together with defrost and crumpet settings			1
convention : the @entity4 £ 99.99 kettle has five different settings for different types of tea each of the innovative machines come with recipes , hints and tips drawn up by the award - winning chef and tv food guru			1
most expensive of the appliances in the range is a £ 549.99 barista coffee machine – the sort of thing found in an independent coffee shop			0
it contains a 250g bean hopper , which is enough for 25 shots of espresso			0
it then grinds the beans and dispenses the doses of fresh coffee into the cups on a six place warming tray			0
for cappuccino lovers there is a high powered milk frothing arm and stainless steel frothing jug			0
