@entity1 's current crop of strikers may be disappointing their team - mates , but the same ca n't be said of loan star @entity4			1
after sending the youngster on a season - long loan to @entity8 , @entity1 will be keeping a close eye on the striker as his side take on @entity12 in the @entity13 on thursday night , and team - mate @entity14 is one of his many admirers			1
' he could be a truly great player for @entity1 , ' the @entity17 defender told @entity18			1
@entity19 international @entity4 signed for @entity21 ' men in june after an impressive @entity22 @entity21 swooped for the 19 - year - old after he starred for @entity19 last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to @entity8 on a season - long loan to aid his development ' he has got great potential and could become on of the best players in his position			1
' @entity29 is one of the greatest talents i have ever played with in @entity32 , @entity33 or @entity34			2
i have no doubt about his potential			0
' he 's still very young and it was a clever move to let him mature one more season with @entity8 , but he 's got the complete package - physically , technically and great speed			1
@entity8 team - mate @entity14 said that @entity29 was extremely versatile and already possessed great technique ' a special thing about him is that he has no real weak spots , which he needs to work on			1
instead he can just work on the things he 's already good at			0
that 's a huge advantage			0
' he 's actually pretty versatile			0
we can use him on both sides and up front as well			0
now i have played with @entity29 for a year and he really seems to have a good mentality			2
he is a dedicated pro at his young age			0
' @entity8 are known as the clean - sheet kings in @entity34 and will be aiming to frustrate @entity12 again after shutting them out a fortnight ago			2
@entity14 , 25 , is their defensive linchpin and says he is relishing going up against @entity57 and @entity58 again after his success in their first meeting			2
the @entity17 defender said the young striker was one of the best talents he had ever played with @entity65 has underperformed since joining the club and some fans believe @entity29 should be recalled ' with @entity8 , we are still unbeaten in the @entity13 , and with another clean sheet , which is our speciality , and maybe even a win , we would still very much be in the race to advance in this tournament , ' said @entity14			1
' i always enjoy playing against top class players like @entity58 , who i know quite well from games in the @entity76 and with the @entity78 national team , and @entity57 , who has a lot of quality			0
' he is the same type of big , strong forward that i meet almost every week in @entity34 .			0

@entity4 signed for @entity1 in the summer , then joined @entity8 on loan
@entity8 's @entity14 says @entity29 is one of the best he 's ever played with
