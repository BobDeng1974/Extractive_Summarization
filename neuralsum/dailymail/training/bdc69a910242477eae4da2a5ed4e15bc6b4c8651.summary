it can be hard to tell whether an animals is content in its surroundings , but scientists have now discovered how goats express emotions			1
the findings could help farmers gain a better insight into the wellbeing of their stock and turn boost welfare			2
they believe the animals express contentment with a stable bleat and small ear movements			2
scientists have examined how goats express subtle positive emotions , which could lead to greater understanding of their welfare			1
they discovered that goats are more likely to point their ears forward ( stock image pictured ) and keep their tail up when they are in a positive state while it can be easy to spot an animal in distress , it is often harder for people who work closely with animals to know when they are content			1
dr @entity33 and dr @entity34 of @entity35 ( @entity35 ) studied goats at @entity37 for @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
they wanted to get a clear understanding of how the animals express their emotions through sound and behaviour in positive in mildly positive and negative situations			1
the researchers discovered that the goats were more likely to point their ears forward and keep their tail up when they were in a positive state			1
they also produced more ‘ stable ’ calls that varied less in frequency			0
the scientists hope that by studying how different animals portray their emotions , they can ensure that they are happy in their surroundings , which is of importance not only to animal welfare groups but to consumers who try and buy free range meat , for example			1

free range chickens are pictured ‘ it is often relatively easy to identify negative emotions in animals but we know little about how they show that they are experiencing positive states , ’ dr @entity33 said			0
‘ subtle hints from goats like small changes in their calls , their heart rate or the position of their ears tell us about what state it is in and could indicate whether their environment is good for their welfare or not			1
’ dr @entity34 , who is now at @entity90 , said : ‘ in this study , we were able to identify not only indicators of emotional arousal , but also whether emotions were positive or negative			0
‘ such indicators are important for the welfare of the animals , because they tell us when the animals are experiencing a negative versus a positive emotion , and we can thus adapt the environment to avoid negative emotions and promote positive ones			2
’ horses look at each other 's ears to read emotions ( stock image ) and when they are interested , their ears prick up just like humans , horses read each other ’s faces			0
but , unlike us , they gain important information by specifically examining the ears , according to a study published in august			0
it seems that when a horse is interested in something , it pricks up its ears and swivels them towards whatever has caught its attention			0
when a horse 's ears are flopping down , it means the creature is relaxed , but when they are pinned back , the horse is expressing anger			0
the movements are so important that , if its ears are covered up , another horse struggles to know what it is thinking			0
the finding comes from @entity133 researchers who studied what makes one horse pay attention to another horse			0
researcher @entity138 , a phd student said : ‘ although horses have very mobile ears , they can only swivel them round , point them forward , pull them up or flatten them back			2
cats and dogs have more movements			0
’ she added that a greater understanding of how horses communicate could help improve their welfare .			2

researchers at @entity35 have examined how goats express subtle positive emotions *-* though calls and behaviours
they are more likely to point their ears forward and keep their tail up when they are content , while their calls are more *variable* when they are *unhappy*
experts say understanding small cues such as these could be used by farmers to improve animal welfare
