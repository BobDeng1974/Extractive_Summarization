when you are related to royalty , life can become one long social whirl			2
and so it has proved for @entity5 , who can barely have paused for breath in the past week as she appeared at a series of high - profile events			2
the latest was as a guest at sir @entity11 ’s annual summer party , where the @entity12 of @entity14 ’s younger sister mingled with the great and the good from the media , politics and showbusiness , including sir @entity19 , @entity20 , sir @entity21 and sir @entity22			1
@entity24 whirl : @entity5 at the wedding in @entity27 ( l - r ) , shopping near her home , at @entity29 on monday and at sir @entity11 's annual party miss @entity5 , who was without her boyfriend @entity31 , looked striking in a vampish red lace sleeveless dress with nude underlay and sheer top			1
the @entity35 by @entity37 dress cost £ 445 , but is now on sale for £ 222.50			1
the 29 - year - old paired it with a £ 135 pair of suede strapped wedges by @entity44 , a sensible choice for a reception on a lawn in a @entity49 summer			1
described as a ‘ simple and elegant occasion dress ’ , it is made from red cotton lace attached at the neck to a sheer ‘ barely there ’ chiffon panel which unzips at the back			2
@entity5 's outfit was the latest in a string of fashions @entity60 has been seen sporting in recent days – some with more success than others			2
@entity5 wore a vampish @entity35 by @entity37 dress that cost £ 445 but is now on half price sale @entity12 of @entity14 's sister was pictured leaving the party with sir @entity22 and wife @entity66 @entity11 said @entity5 was invited because the pair met before the royal wedding and she has been for dinner on saturday she attended the society wedding of the year , the marriage of the @entity72 of @entity74 ’s daughter @entity73 to @entity76 broker @entity75 in @entity27 , @entity74			1

on monday , wearing an elegant pale blue @entity82 dress , she was in the royal box at @entity29 to watch @entity84 and @entity85 win their first round matches			1
however , fashion followers pointed out that both styles had in the past been worn by model @entity91			2
and on tuesday , miss @entity5 drew unflattering comments as she was spotted returning from the shops in @entity94 in a coral cashmere dress and cardigan			1
tuesday night ’s party , hosted by sir @entity11 , 74 , at the @entity99 , also numbered politicians @entity100 and @entity102 among the 300 guests			1
sir @entity11 told the @entity106 : ‘ it was a wonderful evening			1
we were very lucky with the weather and it was a fabulous mix of company , everyone was on very good form			2
’ @entity5 paired her dress , which had a revealing sheer panel at the back , with suede strapped wedges @entity5 mingled with the great and the good from the media , politics and showbusiness at the garden party asked how he knew @entity5 , the broadcaster explained : ‘ we met her before the wedding and she has since been to dinner at our house in @entity99 , so she is a friend in that sense			1
‘ she is a lovely young women , very witty and can hold her own in all kinds of conversation			2
she has taken the enormous interest in her very much in her stride			0
‘ one of the oldest guests there last night was the television presenter @entity135 who , i learned , was 91 , so it is always nice to have a young mix of guests there too			0
’ that wit is also in evidence in a new diary she has written for today ’s edition of @entity146 in which she once again challenges @entity94 mayor @entity147 to a table tennis match			0
she says : ‘ the last time i wrote in these pages , i issued a challenge to @entity147 to take me on at ping pong			0
the mayor said he ’d be up for it , and his office duly contacted the spectator to arrange the details			0
' @entity157 insisted that the match should be held at a venue of their choosing			0
i said by all means			0
the @entity155 has tried to follow up , but now it ’s radio silence from the mayor ’s office			0
is @entity147 scared or what ? he should be			0
’ @entity5 wrote about her love of ' @entity29 ' in her column for @entity155 much of her column , however , was saved for @entity29 or ‘ @entity29 ’ , as she calls it			1
‘ @entity29 is tennis at its best , the grandest of all slams , which is why i like to go every year , at least twice , ’ she writes , which means there is clearly one more appearance to go this year			1
she also wades into the evergreen row about men ’s versus women ’s tennis , saying : ‘ typically i prefer watching the men to the women			0
i do n’t hate my own sex or anything ; i just ca n’t stomach the women players ’ shrieking …			0
. there are male grunters , it should be said ( @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 — though not , of course , the serene and beautiful @entity84 ) , but they have a lower pitch so it ’s not too offputting			0
the shriekers , by contrast , howl so loudly that they make it hard for the audience to focus on the tennis			0
‘ she also recommends a small flutter on @entity204 at 28/1 to win the championships – unfortunate as he pulled out yesterday with a knee injury .			0
