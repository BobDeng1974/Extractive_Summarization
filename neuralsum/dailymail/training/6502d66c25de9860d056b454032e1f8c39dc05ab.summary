problems first arose in august after local media revealed that ms @entity0 managed to obtain a fishing license despite having not lived in the state for at least a year , as the law stipulates			2

' to have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least			0
' sisters at war : the @entity5 candidate for senate @entity0 , left , announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister , @entity140 , right the statement from the former vice president and his wife also appeared to be an attempt to bolster ms @entity0 's run for the @entity2 seat			1

' it 's not , and i stand by both of those positions , ' ms @entity0 said			2
' i do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation			0

' @entity0 responded to that message soon after , saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue ' on which we disagree '			2
