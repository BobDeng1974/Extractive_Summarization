by @entity0 published : 20:26 est , 22 december 2012 updated : 20:27 est , 22 december 2012 hundreds of foreign doctors working in the @entity3 are routinely failing key medical exams , @entity1 can reveal			0
success rates are so poor that medical associations want doctors to be allowed six attempts at passing the tests rather than the current four			1
the revelation raises fears the trainee medics , mainly from @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , are not suitably qualified to treat patients despite spending three years working for the @entity3 before taking the exam			1
hundreds of foreign doctors are routinely failing key medical exams raising fears about whether they are sufficiently qualified to be treating patients until they pass the exams , which qualify them to practise independently as hospital physicians or @entity24 , trainees continue to see patients – under supervision – in placements at hospitals and gp surgeries			2
figures show that foreign doctors are substantially more likely to fail than @entity32 graduates , with communication cited as one of the problems			1
while just nine per cent of @entity32 doctors fail to pass the knowledge and practical exams , more than 63 per cent of foreign doctors do not reach the standard to pass			1
many take the exams up to the current maximum of four times and there is no way for patients to check how many times their gp failed before becoming fully qualified			1
foreign medical associations are now demanding that doctors are given two additional opportunities to pass the tests amid claims that examiners may be discriminating against @entity55 graduates			0
shadow health minister @entity56 said any attempt to make it easier for doctors to pass exams ' must be resisted ' the @entity61 of @entity62 ( @entity63 ) said it had not ruled out taking legal action against the @entity32 medical colleges which set the exams			1
but their claims have been refuted by leading @entity32 specialists who say a recent study showed ‘ no substantial effects of gender or ethnicity on examiner / candidate interactions ’ , and that passing the exams is dependent on having the appropriate skills			1
@entity78 , co-director of campaign group @entity79 , said : ‘ this is scandalous			0
if a doctor can go on failing they should n’t be treating patients in the @entity3 and that should be stopped			2
‘ there has to be a cut - off point and four attempts is too many			2
’ shadow health minister @entity56 said : ‘ any attempt to make it easier for doctors to pass these tough exams must be resisted			0
’ the row centres on foreign doctors who are training to become gps – but a similar difference in pass rates has been observed among doctors hoping to become hospital physicians and psychiatrists			0
about 3,000 doctors a year take their final professional gp exams , set by the @entity102			0
of those , approximately a third are from outside @entity104 and did not complete their basic medical training in the @entity32			1
in these cases , they are permitted to apply for @entity3 training posts , involving three years working in placements			0
the difference in the failure rate between @entity32 and non-uk doctors is particularly pronounced in a part of the exam observing candidates in a mock consulting room , faced with 13 actors posing as patients			1
the test examines their knowledge , ability to ask important questions and listen to patients ’ @entity125 show that 63 per cent of foreign doctors failed the test , with communication one of the main problems			1
around 3,000 doctors a year take their final professional gp exams set by the @entity102 of @entity24 they revealed that 13 per cent of foreign candidates did ‘ not use language and / or explanations that are relevant and understandable to the patient ’ , even though all have taken @entity137 tests before working in the @entity3			1
only 3.8 per cent of @entity32 candidates demonstrated similar communication problems			1
of the @entity13 doctors taking the test , 63 per cent failed at the first attempt			1
for those from @entity14 , there was a 62 per cent failure rate , while 68 per cent of @entity15 doctors failed at the first try			2
foreign doctors were also more likely to fail in a three - hour knowledge test , which is marked anonymously and electronically , ruling out discrimination			2
figures show 16 per cent of @entity32 graduates failed this compared with 46 per cent of foreign doctors			1
@entity154 , president of the @entity102 , wrote to 10,000 trainee gps this week ‘ to set the record straight ’ on the examination			0
the letter said : ‘ as in any exam , a pass can not be guaranteed just because you have completed your training and paid to take the exam			0
this would be a great disservice to you , the @entity102 and , most importantly , to patients			2
’ dr @entity167 , president of @entity63 , said the exam system was ‘ faulty ’			0
he added : ‘ there is a very robust system of selection to get on to @entity3 training in the first place			0
doctors are then only put forward for exams when trainers say they are ready and are happy with their clinical and communication skills			0
‘ we do n’t want to compromise as far as patient safety or standards of the exam are concerned			0
but we are worried that the way one part of the exam is organised is wrong			0
’ dr @entity184 , president of the @entity185 , said : ‘ four attempts is just too low – although we want to extend it to six for all doctors , not just those who are foreign			2
' it may not be discrimination , but possibly just an unconscious bias on the part of the examiners			0

63 per cent fail compared with nine per cent of @entity32
@entity196 revealed as one of the problems
patients ca *n't* check how many attempts they had
