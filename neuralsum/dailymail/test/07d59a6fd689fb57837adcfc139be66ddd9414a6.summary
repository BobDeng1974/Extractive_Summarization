dog walkers have been warned about deliberate attempts to kill their animals after cocktail sausages laced with poison were found at a popular walking spot			1
a clutch of sausages stuffed with poisons were found on the @entity9 , a path running from @entity11 to @entity12 near @entity13			1
the grim discovery comes after a spate of dog poisonings in nearby @entity17 and @entity18 , and dog owners are now being warned by @entity20 to be aware when they are out walking their animals			1
a man out walking his dog found a clutch of cocktail sausages with poisonous pellets inserted into them the cocktail sausages were so densely packed with the poison that eating just one could have killed a dog			1
they were found hidden among grass on the trail			2
photos of the @entity9 sausages were posted on the @entity34 pet service page			2
the post said ' walking along the @entity9 in @entity13 at approximately 6pm this evening , i have found a quantity of cocktail sausages that appear to have a as of yet an unknown substance deliberately inserted into them			1
' so this post is hopefully to help make other owners aware of the possible dangers			2
the sausages were loaded with the poison ( left ) and found hidden among the grass ( right ) on the trail ' thankfully i have a search dog that is able to indicate if something does n't smell right , but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail			1
' hopefully this is the action of some bored mis - guided youth , ( which i 'm sure this is n't the case ! ) but personally i find this premeditated , calculated with actions of someone who knows what they are doing			0
' dogs that have been poisoned may show the following symptoms ; * vomiting * @entity68 * seizures * blood in the stool * @entity72 * loss of appetite * @entity74 * @entity75 * @entity77 gums if dogs display any of these symptoms they should be taken to a vet straight away			0
if possible take the packaging or sample of the poison with you			0
do not attempt to medicate dogs yourself , or encourage them to vomit using salt water			0
if the skin or fur is damaged wash them with a mild shampoo and rinse well with water			0
keep poisoned dogs away from other animals to avoid cross contamination .			0
