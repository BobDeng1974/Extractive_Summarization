by @entity0 @entity3 hunting could return to @entity4 and the @entity5 , it has been claimed			1
the @entity7 tribe once hunted bison in what is now @entity4 , and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice , which ended with @entity13 settlement and the near total extermination of the once - vast @entity16 bison herds			1
herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the @entity5 are also causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows , trample vegetation , damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources			1
the @entity7 tribe once hunted bison in what is now @entity4 , and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice			1
@entity4 , a huge park that covers parts of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 and in which hunting is illegal , once made up a key segment of the @entity34 tribe 's traditional hunting grounds , and some @entity7 leaders say they should again be able to hunt buffalo inside the park			1
' before there was a park , there was a tribe , ' @entity7 chairman @entity43 said			1
' some of our members already feel we have the right to hunt in the park , but it has n't been exercised because we feel it would be remiss in going forward that way			0
' after asserting hunting rights tied to historic treaties in recent years , the @entity7 and three other tribes already hunt those bison that follow ancient migration routes outside the park and into @entity33 in search of winter range			1
the @entity7 have not yet formally requested hunting rights inside the park			1
such a request would require extensive federal review , major changes to @entity4 policies , and congressional action to modify a founding law that banned hunting or killing of buffalo and other wildlife there			1
killing of animals that wander into @entity33 in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem 's carrying capacity , @entity4 officials said			1
the prospect of hunting any of the 4,000 buffalo within @entity4 boundaries is strongly opposed by animal advocates , who decry an existing culling program that allows hundreds of bison to be hunted and shipped to slaughter annually			1
' @entity4 is against any proposal to hunt in the park , ' said @entity92 , chief of the @entity93 , the park 's science and research branch			2
@entity43 said the tribe would not force the issue by violating any of the park 's regulations but may seek to broach the topic with the @entity16 @entity102 , which oversees the national park system , or perhaps lobby @entity104 ' to request those changes be made '			2
the herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the @entity5 are causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows , trample vegetation , damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources			1
the bison were introduced to northern @entity117 in 1906 as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle , creating hybrids known as beefalo or cattalo			2
the state of @entity117 owns and maintains the bison outside the national park , but the animals now are making their home almost exclusively within the boundaries of @entity130			2
federal and state officials are looking at methods to manage the roughly 300 bison in a way that rids them from the park and allows for a free - ranging population that can be hunted on nearby forest land			1
on wednesday , they announced a trio of public meetings to be held in southern @entity142 and @entity117 and a scoping period			0
' it 's the first step in a long process today , ' @entity5 superintendent @entity144 said			2
the massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs , traveled into @entity151 spotted owl habitat , knocked over walls at @entity155 cliff dwellings below the @entity156 , defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands at the @entity5 ' we 're just trying to get it out there and get it on everybody 's radar screens			2
' the bison no longer look like cattle but still have about 10 percent cattle in their genes			0
the massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs , traveled into @entity151 spotted owl habitat , knocked over walls at @entity155 cliff dwellings below the @entity156 , defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands , @entity144 said			0
the iconic symbols of the @entity178 can weigh more than 2,000 pounds and run three times faster than humans , the agency has said			0
management methods likely to be brought up during the public scoping period that ends june 6 include baiting , hazing , fencing , relocating the bison and shooting them			0
@entity144 said birth control has n't proven an effective method for controlling the population			0
public meetings are scheduled for april 28 in @entity192 , @entity142 ; april 29 in @entity193 ; and april 30 in @entity194			0
@entity117 became the owner of the hybrid bison in the northern part of the state after a rancher 's experiment to produce a robust type of livestock by breeding cattle with bison largely failed			0
the offspring of the animals purchased by the state in 1925 began walking up the @entity207 in the late 1990s into the national park , seeking better forage			0
a bison management plan is expected be issued in the fall of 2016			0
management of @entity4 bison has stirred controversy for decades			2
killing of animals that wander into @entity33 in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem 's carrying capacity , @entity4 officials said			2
the culling is also designed to ease the worries of @entity33 ranchers who fear bison will transmit the cattle disease brucellosis , which can cause animals to miscarry , to cows that graze near the park			0
that could put into jeopardy @entity33 's brucellosis - free status , which allows ranchers to ship livestock across state lines without testing			0
@entity239 , @entity33 state veterinarian and member of a state , federal and tribal team that manages bison in and around @entity4 , is a proponent of hunting in the park and told @entity245 in february it needed to be ' looked at more seriously as a possible solution '			1
@entity247 in @entity248 : @entity4 , a huge park that covers parts of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 and in which hunting is illegal , once made up a key segment of the @entity34 tribe 's traditional hunting grounds he said it would bring the herd closer to a population target of 3,000 to 3,500 and lessen the public outcry tied to slaughter of wayward buffalo			1
but @entity4 's @entity92 contends that hunting in the park , which draws 3 million visitors a year because of tourist attractions such as the @entity263 geyser and the bison , would further complicate matters			1
' even a proposal to hunt in the park causes more problems than the dilemma it intends to solve , ' he said			0
' these are @entity16 's wildlife and a crucial part of our national heritage			0
' to propose to hunt in a place established specifically to prevent animals from being hunted is bizarre			0

@entity4 and the @entity5 both considering how to deal with bison population
@entity7 tribe once hunted bison in what is now @entity4 and hope to restart
