@entity0 remains tantalisingly close to swapping @entity1 for @entity2 as @entity3 looks to break his less - than - impressive @entity4 start with a big - money buy			1
but where will @entity0 fit in @entity8 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation ? is he really worth £ 75million ? can he become a no 7 at @entity10 to rank alongside @entity11 or @entity12 ? @entity14 's @entity13 explains what the @entity16 star will be bringing to @entity18			1
watch scroll down for @entity0 's career highlights ahead of his @entity2 move almost : @entity0 is set to become a @entity2 player in a £ 75m swap from @entity1 @entity23 @entity25 - @entity24 @entity27 - @entity26 @entity29 - @entity28 however ... @entity0 is known for his versatility			1
the 26 - year - old can play in central midfield , in a front three , as a left wing - back or even as an emergency left - back			1
almost every tactical shift in @entity8 ’s big black folder will have a place for @entity0			2
where will @entity0 play ? the most logical position for @entity0 to play in @entity8 ’s 3 - 5 - 2 is in the midfield five , just inside the left - wing back			1
@entity41 will eventually operate wide left of the five and @entity0 would play to his right			2
last season he played on the left of the midfield three at @entity1 and he had his best season at the club			0
he has the engine to get up and down the pitch covering the runs of the left wing - back when necessary , just as he did last season filling the gaps left by @entity54 and @entity55 going forward			0
he was also able to make runs from a central position out to the left touchline and get around the back of teams			0
he gave @entity1 dynamism and an unpredictability in attack that @entity2 look like they desperately lack			2
in a 3 - 5 - 2 with @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity24 in defence , @entity27 , @entity64 or @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity26 in midfield , @entity29 and @entity68 up front he would be very much at home			1
on his way ? @entity2 are hoping to secure the signature of @entity1 midfielder @entity0 in the next two days like a glove : @entity0 would fit into @entity3 's 3 - 5 - 2 by sitting inside the man down the left in midfield @entity79 : @entity16 , february 14 1988 ( 26 ) 2005 - 2007 : @entity80 ( 35 apps , 6 gls ) 2007 - 2010 : @entity82 ( 76 , 7 ) 2010 - now : @entity1 ( 124 , 22 ) 2008 - now : @entity16 ( 52 , 10 ) @entity83 : @entity82 : @entity84 , @entity85 ( 2 ) @entity1 : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 ( 2 ) , @entity90 @entity16 : 2014 @entity92 runner - up , @entity93 where else can he play ? for every tactical alternative in @entity8 ’s big black folder there is a role that @entity0 can play			1
the @entity101 ’s versatility is a one of his greatest qualities			0
in the 3 - 5 - 2 formation he could also play as the left wing - back			1
he could play wide left in a 4 - 4 - 2			1
he could also play wide right in a 4 - 4 - 2 coming inside to shoot with his left foot			1
he can play on the left or right of a 4 - 3 - 3 both in the midfield three and the front three			1
@entity108 even had him down as an emergency left back			0
if he ’s so good , why are @entity1 selling ? the same reason they sold @entity111 in 2009			0
the insatiable desire for new players must be , in part , financed by sales			0
three @entity86 finals later no - one can say @entity117 were wrong to sign @entity111			0
catch me if you can : @entity0 is known for his versatility and has even been used by @entity108 at left back where would @entity0 sit in the most - expensive football transfers of all time ? = 1 : £ 86m - @entity124 ( @entity125 to @entity1 ) = 1 : £ 80m - @entity12 ( @entity2 to @entity1 ) = 3 : £ 75m - @entity126 ( @entity127 to @entity128 ) = 3 : £ 75m - @entity0 ( @entity1 to @entity2 ) 5 : £ 71.5m - @entity129 ( @entity130 to @entity128 ) 6 : £ 63m - @entity131 ( @entity132 to @entity1 ) 7 : £ 59m - @entity133 ( @entity134 to @entity128 ) 7 : £ 56m - @entity135 ( @entity136 to @entity1 ) 8 : £ 55m - @entity137 ( @entity138 to @entity139 ) 9 : £ 51m - @entity140 ( @entity141 to @entity132 ) = 10 : £ 50m - @entity142 ( @entity127 to @entity143 ) = 10 : £ 50m - @entity144 ( @entity143 to @entity139 ) is the £ 75m price tag justified ? no , and @entity2 should not have to end up paying that much			1
they are the only buyer bidding here			0
where will @entity1 sell him if not to @entity2 ? @entity139 ca n’t buy him because of financial fair play restrictions			2
@entity149 turned down the chance to buy him earlier in the summer for the same reason			0
real need to sell and @entity2 are in a queue of one so they should not be held to ransom			0
it will be interesting to see if both clubs agree on the price paid			0
remember how @entity1 claimed @entity124 cost about 90m euros and @entity125 insisted it was 100 ? the sale of @entity0 is hugely unpopular so @entity161 needs to justify it with the highest price possible			2
is @entity0 worthy of the @entity165 7 shirt ? just think about that @entity167 tweet for a moment : ‘ thanks for everything			2
i wish you all the best , even if you are going to @entity2			0
we will never forget the zig - zag in extra-time in @entity174 ’			1
tired legs everywhere and @entity0 as fresh as if it were the 10th minute not the 110th minute , hurtling down the left , darting between full back @entity178 and centre back @entity181 , drawing @entity182 and crossing to @entity124 at the back post for him to score the @entity86 winning goal			2
if he produces moments like that for @entity2 he will be more than worthy			0

@entity1 teammate @entity167 tweeted in @entity188 on sunday : ' thanks for everything			1
i wish you all the best , even if you are going to @entity2			0
we will never forget the zig - zag in extra-time in @entity174 ' the next no 7 ? @entity0 could follow in the footsteps of @entity194 , @entity11 and @entity12 farewells : @entity0 said goodbye to his @entity1 team - mates over the weekend as he looks to seal a move en route ? @entity0 has produced magic for @entity1 over the years and can do so for @entity2 and @entity8			1

@entity0 remains on verge of *joining* @entity2 from @entity1 in £ 75million swoop by manager @entity3
@entity0 would play as left - sided forward in @entity8 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation
@entity16 star is versatile but £ 75m is hugely expensive *fee*
@entity2 are only bidders for @entity0
@entity167 tweeted thanks to @entity0 for ' zig - zag ' in @entity174 as @entity1 won the @entity86 over @entity88 rivals @entity141
