@entity0 has been a ' breath of fresh air ' at @entity3 , with @entity4 praising his team - mate for bringing a winning mentality back to the club			1
a big - money summer arrival from @entity10 , the 25 - year - old has hit the ground running in north @entity12 with a remarkable return of 14 goals from 22 appearances			1
those displays have helped spare @entity3 's blushes on several occasions , including wednesday 's @entity20 encounter at home to surprise package @entity22			1
@entity0 netted a late winner for @entity3 in wednesday 's game with @entity26 it took a last - gasp @entity0 strike to see off the well - drilled visitors 1 - 0 , after which @entity4 heaped praise on the game - changing @entity32 forward			1
' there is no rest for him , ' the @entity35 midfielder told @entity38			2
' on recovery days he wants to be playing and he is not happy if he is not allowed to play the game at the end			2
' in training , he wants to win			2
he has brought that winning mentality to the side and i think it definitely rubs off on a lot of players			0
' it has been an eye - opener for me			0
to make it to the top and to be able perform like he does week in , week out you have got to be an absolute winner and you never want to lose at all			2
@entity0 fires home the winner as @entity3 claim all three points against @entity22 ' he is not happy when he does n't score			1
if i scored as many goals as he has at this stage , i 'd be over the moon			1
' he has been brilliant for us and a breath of fresh air , so hopefully he can stay in the form that he is in and we can help him out to keep producing goals like he has been			2
' as good as @entity0 is , though , @entity4 - like anyone else in attendance at the @entity65 - will be aware @entity3 need to improve and quick			1
this was a far from convincing display from @entity69 's men and one which left @entity22 defender @entity72 cursing his luck			1
a first - half injury to @entity75 saw the @entity76 moved from centre - back to holding midfield for the second match in a row - a role he impressed in until a hamstring injury forced him off with less than 10 minutes remaining			0
saints had already used their full complement of substitutions by that point and @entity0 capitalised on the fact @entity22 had to end the game a man light			1
' it 's really s * * * , ' @entity72 said			0
' i think everybody knows when it happens with your hamstring you ca n't run any more , so with pain in my heart i had to go off			0
@entity0 shows off his skills by looking one way and playing a long pass in the other direction ' that was really s * * * and , unfortunately , we let a goal in			1
' on thursday i will have a scan and i hope it 's not too serious , but for sure a hamstring is always bad , so we 'll see			0
' i 'm hoping to recover very soon , very fast			0
i will do everything to be back very quickly on the field , but that 's for the future and i ca n't tell			0
' injuries to @entity72 , @entity113 and @entity114 made this a costly defeat for @entity22 - hardly the ideal preparation for monday 's match against @entity119			1
it is a game they not only approach low on numbers but fresh from back - to - back losses for the first time this season			0
@entity4 has hailed the impact of @entity0 since he joined @entity3 saints have only been beaten four times in all competitions during their remarkable start , yet those reverses have come against @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity3			1
the latest defeat will only fuel the doubters ' suggestions that @entity22 are only third in the standings due to a kind fixture list , but such talk angered @entity72			2
' maybe last week we were not that good , but today we played very good against a good team , especially here , where it 's very difficult to play , ' he said			0
' i think we played very good and i think we deserved a point at least			0
' they have to watch the game			0
maybe after sunday , @entity134 ( 3 - 0 home defeat ) , we did n't play that good , but today we played very good , so we 're still there and we will work very hard to get the points again , so we will do our best			0
