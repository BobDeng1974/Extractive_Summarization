@entity0 is accused of not covering homosexuality in the animal kingdom gay rights campaigners were delighted when the @entity4 approved same - sex marriage this week			1
but it appears there is another fight on the horizon – for equality in sir @entity0 ’s nature documentaries			0
an academic has criticised the @entity14 star for failing to cover homosexuality in the animal kingdom			1
dr @entity17 , head of media studies at the @entity21 , said that while he doubted sir @entity0 was deliberately ignoring the issues , homosexuality is ‘ pretty much everywhere ’ in the animal world			1
he said that by ignoring or sidelining the issue , wildlife documentary makers are skewing the audience ’s view of what is natural			1
dr @entity30 – who has previously criticised such documentaries for invading animals ’ rights to privacy – said : ‘ these programmes make a valuable contribution to environmental awareness and how people think about the world around them			1
they are highly regarded and educational but they should also be offering alternative interpretations of animal behaviour			2
‘ the central role in documentary stories of pairing , mating and raising offspring commonly rests on assumptions of heterosexuality within the animal kingdom			1
‘ this is despite a wealth of scientific evidence which demonstrates that many non-human species have complex and changeable forms of sexual activity , with heterosexuality only one of the many possible options			0
’ dr @entity30 ’s criticisms come after watching hours of sir @entity0 ’s documentaries , spanning two decades			2
in one example from 2003 ’s @entity63 , two male chimps are shown embracing			0
the narrator describes it as an act of friendly affection – but dr @entity30 says alternative explanations should also be given			2
dr @entity17 , head of media studies at the @entity21 , said that while he doubted sir @entity0 was deliberately ignoring the issues , homosexuality is ' pretty much everywhere ' in the animal world in @entity75 in 1998 , viewers were treated to male sandpipers circling one another in an ‘ aggressive ’ manner			1
again , dr @entity30 suggests another interpretation should have been addressed by the programme			2
the academic also complains that sir @entity0 ’s programmes place too much emphasis on traditional family values and monogamy while ignoring promiscuity and single parenting , which are also rife among many animals			0
he highlighted footage of emperor penguins from 1993 that suggests ‘ family is an essential unit for the success of the offspring ’			0
similarly , the description of blue manakins , @entity99 birds which have multiple mates , as ‘ neglectful of their parental duties ’ feeds the idea that one type of family is better than others , it is claimed			0
the researcher chose sir @entity0 ’s documentaries to illustrate his point because of the ‘ perceived authority and reverence ’ lent to them by the veteran broadcaster – but he stressed that other wildlife documentaries are just as guilty			0
dr @entity30 , who airs his arguments in the @entity116 , said : ‘ the research now suggests that [ homosexual ] behaviour can be found in pretty much every species to different extents			1
‘ anywhere people have actually looked , it will be found			0
’ the @entity14 did not respond to requests for comment			0

homosexuality in animal world ' pretty much everywhere '
dr @entity17 says documentary makers are ignoring issue
as a result , audience *'s* view of what is natural is being skewed
