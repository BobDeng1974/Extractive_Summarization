by @entity0 published : 10:39 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 10:48 est , 26 june 2012 evidence : dr @entity2 , pictured leaving @entity3 today , carried out the first post-mortem on @entity5 two days after his death during the @entity8 protests in 2009 the pathologist who examined the body of @entity5 threw evidence down the sink as he had already made up his mind about the cause of death , a court heard today			1
consultant forensic pathologist dr @entity2 , 64 , carried out the first post-mortem on mr @entity5 on april 3 , 2009 - two days after his death during the @entity8 protests in the @entity18			1
his findings led to the official line that the newspaper vendor had died of natural causes in the form of a heart attack			1
this theory was only questioned when footage later emerged of pc @entity27 hitting mr @entity5 with a baton and shoving him to the floor			1
the father - of - nine collapsed minutes later			0
two subsequent post-mortems involving three pathologists concluded that mr @entity5 had been killed by internal bleeding caused by a liver injury , the hearing at @entity3 was told			1
@entity27 denies manslaughter , claiming that his actions were ‘ necessary , proportionate and reasonable ’ in the circumstances			2
prosecutor @entity40 today questioned whether dr @entity2 had given proper consideration to the three litres of ' internal abdominal fluid blood ' - which he later threw down the sink - and blood clots found in mr @entity5 ’s stomach cavity			1
other doctors believe this came from internal bleeding caused when @entity27 attacked the 47 - year - old as he walked away with his hands in his pockets			1
when asked how much attention he gave to the plum - coloured liquid , dr @entity2 said : ' my impression was that there was more body fluid than blood			2
' having done my examination and having come to a cause of death in my mind it was obvious it could n’t be three litres of blood , if it was three litres of blood i would n’t have given the cause of death that i did			0
' mr @entity40 , who pointed out the fluid had been ' poured down the drain into the mortuary sink ' , replied : ' slight chicken and egg problem there mr @entity2			2
on that day did you not see any need to keep the three litres of liquid , blood , fluid , so it could be checked to see what mix it was ? ' dr @entity2 said : ' i did n’t keep it , it is not the thing that is kept by pathologists			2
' but he admitted that the fluid could have been tested by other professionals to see how much of it was blood , if he had not thrown it away			0
he replied : ' yes , i do			0
i have been searching other experts and pathologists for other evidence that would persuade me to believe that death was due to internal haemorrhage and if that was the case i would be the first one to rectify the matter			0
' despite three other pathologists discrediting his findings , dr @entity2 told the hearing that he still believed his ruling was correct			2
he said : ' i actually saw the blood mix and secondly having examined the body looking for injuries that could be caused by significant blood loss and there was none			0
' spots found on the liver could not have produced enough blood to kill mr @entity5 and any injury he received from @entity27 could not have caused him to collapse and die minutes later , dr @entity2 said			1
at the request of the police and coroner he had looked specifically for ' assault crush injuries associated with public disorder ' but the footage had not emerged			0
the court was previously shown film footage of the moment mr @entity5 journey that day using video from he walked past pc @entity27 - who is primed in a strike position behind him starting to fall : @entity131 is accused of hitting mr @entity5 with a ' forceful baton strike ' from behind as mr @entity5 is helped to his feet , @entity131 is no longer visible on the @entity136 footage externally he found a superficial cut above mr @entity5 ’s right eyebrow and bruises and grazes to his legs and knees , including a large 14cm by 6cm bruise to his thigh thought to have been caused by the baton strike			1
but his 2009 report concluded : ' there were no defence injuries , no crush injuries and no significant marks of violence from assault or forceful restraint			0
' dr @entity2 , who maintained that the bruises were not related to death , added today : ' at the time of my examination there was no mention of a baton strike			1
' other bruises and a ' pattern mark ' to the back of his leg could be attributed to impact when he collapsed and were not consistent with bites from a police dog , he said			0
@entity168 fractures to the ribs and bruising were likely to have been caused during resuscitation			0
family : mr @entity5 's widow @entity173 and her son @entity175 arrive at court for a hearing last week mr @entity5 showed signs of alcoholism and chronic liver disorder which dr @entity2 concluded could have caused the internal bleeding			1
he found severe atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries , was the ' most significant pathological evidence ' and therefore recorded a cause of death as a heart attack			2
the court previously heard that @entity27 was bristling with aggression after a protester had scrawled ‘ all cops are b * * * * * * * ’ on a police carrier			0
the prosecution compared the policeman to a thug			0

dr @entity2 carried out first post-mortem on mr @entity5 two days after his death in april 2009 during the @entity8 protests in the @entity18
he concluded that he had died of natural causes in the form of heart attack
footage then emerged of pc @entity27 striking mr @entity5
two further post-mortems then concluded he had been killed by internal bleeding caused by a liver injury
dr @entity2 today stood by his findings
