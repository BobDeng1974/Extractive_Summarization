' ' that ’s obviously not happened , ' he told the paper			1
' we were enjoying the show and we thought things were going well			1
we did n’t want to go			1
' @entity8 was pictured looking grim as he watched the @entity38 and @entity39 game yesterday at @entity40 in @entity41			2

' his equally miffed co-host @entity54 wrote on her @entity57 page this morning : ' morning , what a lovely headline to wake up to			2
my sarcasm comes across in this tweet i hope			2
' but the @entity63 presenter , who is engaged to @entity65 footballer @entity64 , at least knows where her next pay cheque is coming from			2
she was confirmed to be replacing @entity67 as co-host of @entity69			2
sour mood : @entity8 looked grim as he watched the @entity38 and @entity39 game yesterday at @entity40 in @entity41 @entity1 followed her tweet up with : ' aside from that , thank you so much for all your @entity69 good luck messages			1
