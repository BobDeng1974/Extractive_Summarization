formation 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 – i ’d be bold and adventurous and it would mean @entity2 either take the tournament by storm or go out in a blaze of glory as one of the best teams never to win the @entity9			1
@entity10 @entity11 @entity14 @entity13 @entity12 @entity15 @entity18 @entity17 @entity16 @entity20 @entity19 go for broke : @entity16 should start in @entity2 's opening @entity9 game against @entity22 the future : the talented @entity17 ( left ) must be allowed to shine in @entity24 the weak link is @entity11 , but if he can do something special – like this goal for example , then that will make up for his obvious defensive shortcomings			1
the key to this formation being a success over the @entity34 lies in the three – @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity16 - being so energetic that they give @entity37 the kind of nightmares that make him think about retiring from football			2
he wo n’t be able to pass a ball after being given the runaround by those three			0
they will also energise and inspire @entity20 , who is a striker with an incredible goalscoring record			0
he slows down in the no 10 role or out wide , so play him up front with another goal machine @entity19 – they score goals , and goals win matches			0
it ’s not rocket science			0
right - back : @entity54 defender @entity11 could be @entity2 's weak link in @entity56 goal machine : @entity20 must play up front with @entity19 to take the game to @entity22			1

@entity2 should play a bold and adventurous 4 - 1 - 3 - 2 formation
@entity18 , @entity17 and @entity16 should be positioned in front of @entity15 in *midfield*
@entity20 and @entity19 should begin up front against @entity22
