the six - year - old golden retriever recently earned the @entity5 for the loudest bark , registering an incredible 113.1 decibels , the same as a loud rock concert			1
it is even louder than the average human pain threshold , 110 decibels			0
fortunately for @entity16 's postal workers , @entity1 only barks on command			2
' he does n't bark at home at all really , he 's really quiet , ' the mother - of - three said			2
@entity1 's bark is louder than a jet taking off from 300 metres away , a pneumatic drill or a helicopter hovering 100 ft overhead			1
bow wow : @entity1 reaches 113.1 decibels when he barks - 42 times louder than everyday conversation @entity1 with his family ( left to right ) @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity12 the previous @entity5 for the loudest bark was set by a @entity36 from @entity37 called @entity38 in 2009			1
his bark was an eardrum - pounding 108 decibels			2
the world 's loudest living creature is , bizarrely , the tiger pistol shrimp			0
native to the @entity44 , this shrimp stuns its prey with a large claw that shoots jets of water , creating an air bubble that creates a shock wave when it implodes			0
despite being less than an inch long , the creatures can emit an astonishing 218 decibels - louder than a gunshot			0
the sound stuns small fish and crabs , allowing the shrimp to move in for the kill .			0

@entity1 's record - breaking bark is as loud as a rock concert
the golden retriever is louder than a pneumatic drill or a jet taking off
his owner says he has had the powerful bark since he was just a year old
