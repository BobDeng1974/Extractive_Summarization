by @entity0 dr @entity1 wakes every morning at around 4.30am experts say skipping just an hour or two of sleep a night can harm health			1
but this does n't bother dentist dr @entity1			1
she wakes every morning at around 4.30am - out of choice			1
' for me , a lie - in is getting up at 6am , ' she says			0
usually asleep by around 11pm , dr @entity1 even rises early following nights when she has gone to sleep much later			1
' last night , i had a work do to attend and accounts to get through after that , so i did n't go to bed until 3am , ' she says			0
' but i automatically opened my eyes at 6am , without setting the alarm			0
' it 's very rare for me to feel sleepy during the day , and i know as a doctor this is the measure of whether you sleep enough			1
' both her parents were early risers and dr @entity1 believes she has inherited this			1
' my father used to tell us that sleep was practising death and as kids we had to be at the breakfast table at 6am every day , no matter what happened the day before			1
' dr @entity1 's husband @entity32 , a doctor , used to find her early rising hard to cope with			1
' he is the opposite to me - he loves staying up late and sleeping in			0
to keep the peace , when we go on holidays we always book a suite so i can quietly get up and work in the other room and he can sleep			1
' the number of @entity42 who , like dr @entity1 , get just five to six hours sleep a night has risen dramatically in the past three years			1
a report from the @entity45 last year suggested that 33 per cent of us get by on five to six hours ' a night , compared with 27 per cent in 2010			0
the average @entity47 today gets around six hours and 35 minutes ' sleep			1
only around 5 per cent of us function well on little sleep , so this drop in an average night 's resting hours might be deeply worrying			1
it might also help explain the significant rise in prescriptions for drugs to treat insomnia , including zopiclone and temazepam			0
according to the @entity61 , fewer than ten million prescriptions were written in 2002 , rising to more than 15 million in 2012 ; one in three people now complains of suffering from bouts of insomnia			0
however , experts such as @entity67 - @entity66 , professor of sleep and physiology at the @entity70 , now emphasise that it 's the quality of sleep , rather than the quantity , that is important			1
' sleep need is individual and can vary from five to nine hours , ' says professor @entity66			1
' a quality night 's sleep is n't necessarily going to be eight hours for everyone			1
' sleep with interruptions can reduce its restorative effects , so ' quality sleep ' is often defined as being uninterrupted , allowing the body to go through the different sleep stages that restore emotional and physical well - being , he explains			1
to measure sleep quality , scientists rely on people 's daytime sleepiness			1
' if you feel sleepy and doze off during meetings , take longer than normal to complete tasks or at weekends sleep much longer , then the sleep you are getting may not be of good quality , ' says professor @entity66			1
the proportion of people whodo n't get to bed until after midnight ironically , worrying about getting a full eight hours could be one of things stopping us getting a quality night 's continuous slumber			1
at night , hormones such as melatonin - produced when the body is exposed to darkness - and serotonin - a calming brain chemical - should kick in to make us sleepy			0
however , when we start to worry about something , the effects of these can be outweighed by stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol			0
for those of us blighted by erratic sleep patterns , doctors now believe dr @entity1 's blase attitude towards slumber could be the key to getting better sleep			1
' the paradox is that being less fixated on sleep is the key to getting a better night 's sleep , ' says @entity126 , professor of clinical psychology and director of the @entity129 at the @entity130			1
' there are things our bodies and brains are designed to do automatically			0
sleep is one , and it 's determined by biology and genes			2
' experts now emphasise that it 's the quality of sleep , rather than the quantity , that is important this means some people naturally need more or less sleep than others , and this can vary widely			1
the amount you need is wired into your biology like your fingerprint , says professor @entity126			0
but such natural functions get impaired by our anxiety to perform them well			0
' people with insomnia will often wake in the middle of the night and think : “ oh my @entity160 ! i ca n't sleep			2
” and that starts their alarm bells			0
' they lie there worrying about not sleeping , thinking : ' i am awake again , i am going to perform badly at work tomorrow , i am going to feel awful , i need to get to sleep			2
” ' that puts the brain into threat mode , in which the body responds physiologically as though it is being attacked , releasing stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to help it deal with a perceived danger , explains professor @entity126			0
' this is the exact opposite to the relaxed state the body needs to be in to fall asleep			0
' for dr @entity1 , 44 , sleeping less has corresponded with getting older			1
in her 20s and early 30s , she would sleep for seven hours ; now it 's for about five			2
this need for less sleep as we get older is not uncommon			2
' many older people still expect to get the eight hours of sleep they got when they were younger and lie in bed worrying about getting less now , ' says professor @entity66			2
' this is not necessarily conducive to getting a quality night 's sleep			1
' people often think there is something wrong , when in reality - if their sleep is of good quality - it 's just normal , ' he says			1
in fact , research shows older people who have fewer than the traditional eight hours are less sleepy during the day			0
in one of professor @entity66 's studies conducted at @entity209 , people over 60 and people in their 20s were asked to spend 16 hours in bed			0
the older people managed to sleep for only seven - and - a - half hours of that , while the younger ones slept just under nine			2
professor @entity66 's team recorded their brainwaves and found older people who slept fewer hours were less sleepy during the day than the younger ones			0
' research indicates that older people get less sleep and probably need less sleep , and should n't be worried about that , ' he explains			2
' sleep is related to plasticity of the brain , it has to do with learning new skills and memory			2
young people 's brains are always learning and thus need more sleep			2
' ' they should be worried if they feel sleepy during the day because that indicates they either do n't get enough quality sleep or there 's some underlying sleep problem			1
' of course , there are real forms of insomnia as distinct from that caused by worrying about not getting enough sleep			2
research shows older people who have fewer than the traditional eight hours are less sleepy during the day typically , these are caused by stress or underlying medical conditions such as diabetes , heart disease or osteoporosis , or medications including painkillers or antidepressants			0
recent research from @entity209 found that increased smartphone and tablet use at bedtime suppressed the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin			2
but if it 's quality of sleep , not quantity , that matters , does this mean we can ignore the regular dire warnings about the health effects of lack of sleep ? just last week , a study from @entity267 , in @entity265 , found that being sleep - deprived caused a similar change in the brain to that seen after a head injury			1
other conditions that have been linked to chronic lack of sleep include multiple sclerosis , and a greater risk of heart attacks , strokes and angina - possibly because sleep deprivation raises blood pressure , which increases the risk of artery damage			2
professor @entity66 says there is no good evidence that not getting enough sleep raises the risk of @entity289 however he explains : ' for some other conditions , such as cardiovascular disease , obesity and diabetes , epidemiological evidence suggests that abnormal sleep patterns - defined in most studies as less than six hours a night - are a contributing factor			2
' so how does the new emphasis on quality , rather than quantity , of sleep square with links to such health problems ? ' we do n't know the answer to that because most studies have only looked at self - reported sleep duration without measuring sleep quality , ' he says			1
' risk increases when you consistently sleep less than your body needs			0
' meanwhile , one of the most effective treatments for insomnia caused by sleep anxiety involves asking patients to essentially give up on sleep			0
called paradoxical intention therapy ( @entity321 ) , patients instead try to stay awake			0
@entity321 is recognised by the @entity322 as one of the few evidence - based psychological therapies for sleep , and - although not available on the @entity326 for sleep problems - is an acknowledged therapy practised by @entity42 psychologists			0
' patients realise that when they try to remain awake , they feel sleepier			0
people who sleep well do n't try to sleep , ' says professor @entity126 , who has pioneered the study and use of @entity321			0
' @entity336 is a classic example , especially if it 's an engrossing book , as it 's often trying to stay awake and read more that makes people fall asleep naturally , ' he explains			0
and , finally , here 's something that might relax those with sleep anxiety - they may be getting more than they think			0
' often we will ask someone who reports having insomnia : “ how long did you sleep ? ” and they say : “ two hours , ” ' says professor @entity66			0
' then we measure their sleep by recording brainwaves and other signals and find they actually slept six - and - a - half or seven hours			0
