this was just the second time in three years @entity3 manager @entity2 has dared to venture to the @entity4 but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back			1
it was not just the @entity3 contenders — @entity9 and @entity10 — who failed to impress ; every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next			1
referee @entity13 and his assistants were equally inept , failing to send off @entity16 ’s @entity15 early in the game and later denying @entity18 a legitimate goal			1
@entity10 is tackled by @entity20 during the @entity21 between @entity18 and @entity16 @entity18 manager @entity22 on the side line during the @entity25 game at @entity4 the draw — @entity18 ’s 13th of the @entity25 season — has done little to ease the pressure on @entity18 boss @entity22 , who this week wrote to the fans asking for their support			1
but the @entity32 did have reason to moan about some first - half refereeing			0
the game was just five minutes old when @entity37 sprung @entity38 clear on the shoulder of @entity15 and , under minimal contact from the recovering defender , the striker flopped to the turf			2
man of the moment @entity43 fails to continue his fine goal scoring run against @entity16 referee @entity13 waved play on , only for assistant @entity49 to flag for an infringement			1
@entity15 , then , would surely have to go			2
@entity13 , though , opted to show a yellow			2
the officials were again the centre of attention when they disallowed @entity57 ’s goal on the stroke of half - time			0
@entity60 crossed to the far post where the winger — played marginally onside by @entity64 — poked in			0
@entity22 said : ‘ it ’s onside			0
i understand why he gave offside , but it was a mistake			0
@entity67 makes a save during the @entity25 match between @entity18 and @entity16 @entity22 lets his feelings be heard during the goalless draw against @entity16 at the @entity4 ‘ i was more disappointed with the @entity15 one			1
if you make the decision it ’s a foul then it should be a red card			0
’ but @entity16 boss @entity78 said : ‘ i ’ve seen old women in the high street take more of a knock and stay on their feet			0
’ @entity16 , though , barely mustered a shot on goal with @entity9 failing to impress in front of @entity2			1
@entity78 added : ‘ @entity9 has been fantastic for us but he took a knock early in the game and struggled			2
he ’s had better days			0
’ as has everyone who had the misfortune to be at the @entity4			0
@entity9 and @entity91 of @entity18 compete for the ball in front of the fans			1

@entity18 had a legitimate goal disallowed at the @entity4
referee @entity13 should also have sent @entity15 off
@entity2 watched as @entity10 and @entity9 *stuttered*
the game was @entity18 *'s* 13th draw of the @entity25 season
