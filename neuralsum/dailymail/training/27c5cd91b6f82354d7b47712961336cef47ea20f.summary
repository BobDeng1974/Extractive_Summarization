a former glamour model fears she 's destined to be single forever - because no man will ever match up to her cats			2
@entity3 , 40 , from @entity4 , @entity5 , is so crazy about her pampered cats that she spends an incredible £ 4,000 a year tending to them			1
but men run a mile when @entity10 ( yes , really ! ) brings her two pets @entity11 and @entity13 out on dates with her			1
she even insists they share her bed , no matter who else is in it			2
model @entity3 fears she 's destined to be single forever , due to her intense love of her cats @entity13 ( pictured ) and @entity11 model @entity10 has never had a proper long - term relationship - and claims it 's because she ca n't find a man who will put up with her obsession			1
she said : ' i love them so much - i think they might be @entity28 's most pampered cats			1
' when blokes find out that they sleep in the bed with me and that they are with me all the time , they disappear			1
' but if a man does n't love my cats as much as i do , he 's got no place in my life			2
spoilt cats @entity11 and @entity13 live a life of luxury , sleeping only on goose - feather pillows and enjoying regular trips to the salon			1
doting @entity10 even takes them to restaurants on their birthdays			0
she ca n't bear to be apart from the pair , and they even join the @entity50 girl at work on photoshoots			0
@entity10 says one guy she went on a date with called it quits when she said the cats sleep in the bed which means that no matter how many dates she goes on , she ca n't find the right man for her and her felines			1
lifelong cat lover @entity10 bought female @entity13 and male @entity11 a year ago and has dedicated her life since to making sure they want for nothing			1
at home they rule the roost , sharing @entity10 's bed and refusing to let her shut any doors so they can have complete reign over the house			2
@entity13 likes the blinds opened as soon as it is light - meaning her owner rises at 4am every day to make sure her pampered puss can see out of the window			1
potential suitors have told @entity10 they 'd like to ask her out but wo n't play second fiddle to @entity13 and @entity11			1
others have refused to take the relationship any further than one date when they find out about her spoilt pets			0
and although she was seeing one easy going guy for just under a year , they broke up when her constant comparisons between his young child and her cats became too much for him			1
just like a small child , @entity88 and @entity11 are picky about their food and eat only the best in breed specific brands			1
when they 're not modelling for @entity10 's artwork , she wines and dines them at restaurants and hotels where cat friendly waiters bring out bowls of water and the moggies sit on chairs at the table			0
for @entity11 's first birthday @entity10 threw a party complete with a cake and a stocking full of presents			1
and @entity13 's extra-long hair needs so much attention that she grooms her two to three times a day			1
@entity10 now mainly models hosiery , and regularly takes the cats to photo shoots with her where they get free rein to wander around the studio			2
but if she goes to work for a day and they ca n't join her on shoot , they stay with her mother who calls @entity10 so she can chat to them on the phone throughout the day			0
@entity10 even claims she has learnt to speak ‘ cat ' and says @entity11 can answer her with different types of miaows when she asks him a question			1
@entity10 now models hosiery , and regularly takes the cats to photo shoots with her @entity13 sleeps only on luxury goose - feather pillows and enjoys regular trips to the salon @entity10 said : ' the cats are my babies and because they have such a close relationship to me , that 's too much for some people			1
' i 've been on lots of dates and when i 've mentioned the cats , the reaction straight away has n't been very good			1
' but if they do n't understand then i just refuse to go on another date with them			0
' who needs a man when i have @entity13 and @entity11 's faces to wake up to every morning and they look forward to me coming home			1
' i can imagine that people could find it a bit extreme but i 'm not looking for a boyfriend at the moment anyway			0
' there have been six blokes that i 've been out with that have had to go because they did n't like the cats			2
' several guys have told me that they would ask me out but they do n't want to be second best to two pets			0

' he actually said : ‘ i do n't want to go to bed with your cats			1
' ' i had one boyfriend that i went out with for just under a year and he had a young child			0
he got really annoyed because every time he said something about his child , i would compare it to my cats			2
' everything his child could do , my cats could do as well			2
' most dates just think i talk about them too much and that 's too much for them			2
' i can see how it could be a bit irritating but it 's a case of " love me , love my cats "			2
' everything i do for them is worth it - i do n't mind ditching boyfriends and cutting nights out short because they come first			0
' my cats live an unusual lifestyle but i love them so much i want to give them everything i can			0
' they even come to the pet shop with me to choose the things they want			0
' they do lunch in local bars and restaurants and they 've very good and patient			0
' although i 'd love to , i 'd never give them human food - it 's so bad for cats and i only want the best for my babies			0
' people dress up dogs and take them for walks so i do n't see why it should n't be the same for cats			0
' and because they 're my darlings we celebrate their birthdays like we would one of my friends			0
' they get a cake with their name on , a stocking full of toys and goodies as well as main present			0
' it 's so nice to be able to treat them			0
' it does all add up but they 're totally worth it			0
' people are often surprised when i arrive with them but because they 're so happy and look so contented everyone just gets used to it			0
' but @entity13 and @entity11 come first			1
if they suddenly decided they were n't happy with the grooming or the walks or the clothes , i 'd be the first to put it on hold			0
' i guard them with my life - they 're my darlings			0
' for @entity11 's first birthday @entity10 threw a party complete with cake and a stocking full of presents			2
