by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 09:58 est , 20 february 2013 guinea pigs which have no fur are the latest pet craze sweeping across @entity4 , but animal campaigners say the sickly pets are a huge responsibility the wrinkly skinny pigs , which are selling for £ 120 each , are almost completely bald and have to live inside with their owners during the winter to keep warm			1
the cute creatures , which look like the @entity12 from 1970 's kids tv , do not occur in the wild and were a genetic mutation , created in @entity18 @entity17 lab in @entity19 in @entity20 in 1978			1
but animal campaigners say they can suffer health problems and urged pet lovers to think twice before buying a spokeswoman from the @entity30 said the lack of fur can cause unnecessary pain , discomfort , illness and behavioural problems and that no animal should be bred primarily for how it looks			1
she added : ' the @entity30 would n't recommend people buy these animals due to the welfare problems associated with selectively breeding them for lack of hair , and because they will have complex needs that must be met to keep them happy and healthy			1
' animal charities are full to the brim with small animals looking for homes , and we would urge anyone interested in having a pet to consider re-homing a compatible pair of rescue guinea pigs instead			2
' skinny pigs bear an uncanny resemblance to 1970s children 's tv show the @entity12 the chief vet of animal welfare charity @entity60 , @entity62 , has concerns about the increasing commoditisation of animals , including the rise of ‘ handbag ’ and wolf - like dogs			1
she said : ' many pets are bred for particular traits , but when choosing any pet , you should never base the decision on appearance alone			2
' it ’s really important to remember that " skinny pigs " have the same welfare needs as regular guinea pigs , although with a hairless variety , owners will also need to give extra protection from the cold , sun and injury , which their fur would usually provide			2
' the main concern for @entity60 is that it is increasingly easy to buy a pet on a whim without giving proper thought to the commitment needed			0
' the animals do not occur in the wild and were a genetic mutation , created in a @entity20 lab in 1978 their lack of hair has made them hugely popular with allergy sufferers and an increasing number of @entity103 are buying the coat - free guinea pigs as family pets			1
' i 've always been fascinated by unusual pets and when i saw my first skinny pig i knew i had to have one , ' said @entity109 , who looks after more than 40 skinny pigs in her home and is the leading breeder in the @entity4			2
' i bought a lilac and white sow called " @entity115 " , and so it all began			0
i love the fact they live indoors with me and they have become like part of the family			1
cute : skinny pigs have only tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet ' they are cheeky , inquisitive , gentle and friendly , so they are good fun and make great pets			2
' skinny pigs have tiny tufts of hair on their noses and feet , but otherwise they are completely naked from birth , with their plump bodies and stumpy legs on show			0
they come in a variety of skin colours , including albino , chocolate , silver , cinnamon , lilac , white , golden and even @entity144 - which are white with black spots			0
' i love the @entity144 markings on any guinea pig and find it particularly striking in the hairless , " added @entity109			0
skinny pigs must stay indoors because they are ill - suited to the cold and require sun cream in summer curious : this adorable little fellow is peeping out from a basket the markings on the animals vary , with chocolate brown being a popular choice among pet lovers ' my favourite colour is chocolate			1
they are the most popular alongside well marked darker @entity144			0
' unlike traditional guinea pigs , skinnies can not live outside as they would never survive the cold and have to be kept warm in a heated home			0
on warm sunny days they can graze in the garden , but need sun - cream of factor 50 + so their delicate skin does not get burnt by the sun. @entity109 breeds and sells the unusual creatures for £ 120 each skinnies also have a higher metabolism than normal guinea pigs in order to maintain their body heat , which means they eat a lot of food			1
' they will happily munch away all day long , ' said @entity109 , who runs @entity186 in @entity187 , @entity188			0
' they can also be messy as they never manage to keep all the bedding in their cages and quite noisy too			0
' they soon learn to recognise a fridge door opening or the rustle of a bag that could mean food , and a whole herd can start calling loudly in anticipation of being fed. ' they are really entertaining little creatures and have great personalities			0
' the cute creatures , which are now ethically bred in the @entity4 , can live up to six years and enjoy the company of other skinnies and their owners			2
she added : ' they are always better pets if handled well from birth and boars usually being more affectionate than sows			0
' it 's so hard to imagine my precious little skinny pigs have descended from lab animals			1

striking pets descended from lab - grown genetic mutations
popular among those who suffer from hair allergies
but @entity30 says the breed are difficult to keep healthy and happy
the bald animals must live indoors and need sun cream in summer
@entity30 : ' no animal should be bred for how it looks '
