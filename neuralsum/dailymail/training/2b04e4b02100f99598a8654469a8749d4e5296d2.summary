this letter is written by a woman called @entity25 , she posted the colourful piece to herself on @entity27 as part of the # survivorloveletters project which was started by the artist @entity8 the project was launched on @entity31 along with with feminist activist @entity32 so that the moving accounts could be shared with and read by other victims			1

this letter was written to a woman named @entity58 in it it says , ' i want you to know how proud i am of you for keeping your head up and your heart open to the beautiful things this world still has to offer ' ' that 's when i knew i wanted to create # @entity67 was incredibly grateful that activist @entity68 helped kick off # survivorloveletter on twitter and that @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and other women i admire joined the conversation			1
