by @entity0 @entity1 today announced that he would put £ 340million towards fixing @entity3 's battered infrastructure by repairing potholes and building new flood defences			1
following the winter storms which left areas of the country underwater , the chancellor announced that he would be making an extra £ 140million available for repairs to flood defences and providing £ 200million for local authorities to repair potholes			1
the winter storms flooded 7,000 homes , killed 11 people and caused untold devastation , with @entity18 among the worst - hit areas after the wettest winter since records began			0
announcement : a £ 340million fund for flood defences and repairing potholes has been promised after record storms left swathes of the country , including on the @entity29 ( pictured ) underwater soaked : a woman pushes her dog in a wheelbarrow through flooded @entity34 last month @entity36 - force winds and flooding led to felled power lines and blackouts for more than 100,000 families , while it has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £ 830million			1
much of the country ’s transport network was plunged into chaos , with roads and railways wrecked , and countless buildings damaged			0
the government was also forced to call in troops to help rescue stranded victims			0
today 's announcement follows @entity57 ’s promise during last month ’s crisis that ‘ money is no object ’ in clearing up the damage and preventing a repeat			2
however , the extra money promised today by mr @entity1 has been criticised for not going far enough in solving either issue , with the flood defence fund described as a merely a ' sticking plaster ' by dr @entity67 , director of engineering at the @entity68			1
' the £ 140 million announced in today ’s budget for repairs to @entity3 flood defences is a " sticking plaster " approach and simply does not go far enough , ' he said			1
' the government needs to be investing in new flood defences and ongoing maintenance projects to ensure long - term @entity3 resilience , neither of which was mentioned by the chancellor			1
equally , there was no mention of resilience plans for other extreme weather conditions which the @entity3 will be increasingly susceptible to in future years			0
' every £ 1 spent in resilience saves £ 4 in future relief and rebuilding costs , which is why we need to be taking a much longer - term view of @entity3 infrastructure			2
' elsewhere , the @entity68 welcomes the chancellor ’s proposals to provide £ 7 billion to cut energy bills for manufacturers in energy - intensive industries			2
ongoing : flood water remained in fields surrounding the village of @entity99 on the @entity29 last weekend after the rain : it has been estimated that the floods will cost cost small businesses more than £ 830million ' these initiatives will help @entity3 firms become more competitive in the global market by reducing costs and encouraging them stay in the @entity3			1
' @entity109 also welcomes the continuing support for graphene , a truly @entity3 invention with a multitude of future possibilities			0
the creation of a new centre of excellence will advance the already committed £ 111m to graphene research and exploitation , and will help the @entity3 reap the commercial benefits this miracle material			2
' additionally , while we welcome the support for @entity124 and regional airports and the chancellor ’s vision of seeing this beyond the current plans , we need to see more details and the government needs to show more commitment to creating an integrated @entity3 transport system			0
' @entity134 , chief executive of the @entity135 said that the flood defence money was welcome , but raised concerns over flood insurance police			1
' we are pleased to see that the government is committed to spending on flood defences and helping those that have been hardest hit by the recent storms , but today 's announcement of £ 140m funding to repair flood defences do not assuage our fears about the government 's new flood insurance scheme , @entity150 , which currently stands to expose thousands of homeowners to rocketing insurance premiums , ' she said			1
@entity154 economics campaigner , @entity153 said also criticised the government 's pledge , and said that mr @entity1 had not done enough to address climate change			1
budget : @entity1 with the traditional red dispatch box as he departs to deliver his annual budget speech funds : mr @entity1 told the @entity162 that money would be available for repairs after the winter floods he said : ' merely weeks after promising action on flooding and global warming , the best the chancellor can manage is a u-turn on his own reckless flood defence cuts , and caving in to big business lobbying on pollution tax			1
' mr @entity1 says he wants to make our economy " resilient " , but @entity3 face paying a hefty price for his failure to confront the reality of climate change			1
' he added : ' @entity1 ’s self - congratulation on flood spending is ill - founded			1
' the " extra " £ 140m only cancels out previous cuts , while households in storm - battered @entity3 are picking up the bill for the government ’s negligence			1
' and if we want to keep pace with the impacts of climate change , far more must be spent on flood defences			1
' professor @entity192 , director of the @entity194 foundation , welcomed the £ 200million put aside to repair potholes , but said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog			1
‘ a succession of bad weather , including the recent floods , has wrought havoc on our roads and any money to fill the potholes is welcome , ' he said			2
' but the drip , drip of funding does not address the £ 10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified			0
it is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for			0
this creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits			0
’ bump in the road : local authorities will be provided with an extra £ 200million for local authorities to repair potholes backlog : professor @entity192 , director of the @entity194 foundation said the money would not be enough to address a road maintenance backlog @entity222 , vice chairman of the @entity224 's economy and transport board , welcomed the extra funding , but said the country was facing a 42per cent increase in traffic on local roads by 2040 , and the situation on the roads was getting worse			1
' this announcement does not go anywhere near far enough			0
we urge the government to provide a full and comprehensive package , including the resurfacing of roads , rather than funding in dribs and drabs			0
' mr @entity1 also announced a number of other transport measures			2
there will be a guarantee of up to £ 270million to support the raising of debt finance for the @entity249 - a project that will see a road bridge over the @entity252 in north west @entity253			0
also , the government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the @entity258 north of @entity259 upon @entity260 further north into @entity261 , if the @entity254 will match fund the costs of the study			0
mr @entity1 said that the @entity254 had agreed that the @entity264 can use existing powers to begin investing in improvements to the @entity267			2
the @entity3 @entity254 is also financially supporting the @entity270 enterprise partnership 's transport and infrastructure plans in a deal that could be worth up to £ 500 million over 15 to 20 years			0
investigation : the government is offering to extend the feasibility study on possible improvements to the @entity258 north of @entity259 upon @entity260 further north into @entity261 mr @entity1 said the vehicle excise duty ( @entity278 ) car tax would increase by the @entity280 rate of inflation from april 1 2014 but , as announced earlier , @entity278 rates for lorries will be reduced and restructured from april 1			2
@entity285 chief executive @entity284 said : ' the chancellor has done little to reduce the everyday cost of transport which remains one of the biggest costs faced by households ' the £ 20 million tax break the chancellor is giving to bingo halls would be better spent reversing the planned cuts to bus services this year			0
extra money to tackle potholes is welcome , but this is a drop in the ocean against the £ 10bn backlog to local road repairs			1
these are the issues that matter to people rather than big road building			0
' sustainable transport group @entity306 said : ' any money to repair this winter 's damage to our roads is welcome but , considering the £ 10 billion road maintenance backlog , £ 200 million is nowhere near enough			2
' potholes are dangerous for all road users			0
resolving this crisis will save lives			0
