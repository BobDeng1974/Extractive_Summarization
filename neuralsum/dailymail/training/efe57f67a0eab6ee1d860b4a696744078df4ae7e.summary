the @entity11 said the current water stocks feeding the fountains will run out at the weekend			1
negotiations are underway to see if a compromise can be found in time for the arrival of millions of tourists to @entity2 during the @entity18 and jubilee summer			0
still waters : the famous fountains in @entity2 have been turned off as part of a hosepipe ban imposed across @entity23 as a result of low rainfall this winter all quiet : drops of water trickle from the spout a fountain at one of @entity3 's top tourist spots run dry : the @entity33 stands behind the eerily still pool where @entity5 has decided to cut water supplies to help drought - hit reservoirs something missing : @entity38 looms over an unusually quiet @entity2 bans on hosepipes for 20million people in the drought - hit @entity42 of the country came into force yesterday , ahead of a drizzly weekend for the @entity45 and @entity46 , but more sunshine in the @entity42			1
water firms say the ban is likely to last until the autumn if not into next year , even if there is normal rainfall during the summer			1
this march saw just 37 per cent of the long - term average rainfall in all of @entity54 and @entity55 , according to the @entity56 – just a little above last year which was the driest march on record whilst february saw just 46 per cent of the average			1
an @entity61 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s not beyond the realms of possibility it will carry on into next year			0
‘ even if it is a rainy summer , a lot of the rainfall is absorbed by plants and it does not help boost our supplies after two dry winters have left our reservoirs and aquifers very low			0
‘ we have to be realistic and responsible , and will lift them as soon as we are able			0
’ @entity75 said the ban was likely to last the whole summer and could carry on into next year , unless there were weeks of continuous heavy downpours			0
@entity80 of @entity5 said : ‘ realistically it will be in through the summer into the autumn , as summer rain does n’t do much			0
unless we have a particularly wet summer			0

running dry : tourists may not be able to cool off this summer in @entity3 's @entity2 fountains after the water supply was turned off under the hosepipe ban disappointment : the fountains had undergone a £ 200,000 pre-olympic makeover ahead of the @entity96 which is expected to bring millions of tourists into the capital dry : the @entity100 in the village of @entity102 , near @entity103 , is just one of many waterways with record low levels as @entity54 faces a strict hosepipe ban to combat the drought @entity61 last imposed a hosepipe ban in the summer of 1990 – it lasted 15 months			1
seven water companies have banned the use of hosepipes and sprinklers to water the garden , wash vehicles or boats , clean patios or any other surfaces or for recreational purposes			1
watering cans still be used , and there are exemptions for blue badge holders and cleaning for safety reasons			0
but the @entity126 warned hosepipe bans were ‘ not a silver bullet ’ , and urged business to clamp down on washing cars and windows to save water			1
groundwater levels are lower than during the drought of 1976 in parts of @entity136 , the @entity137 and the @entity138 , and reservoirs are extremely low			2
public fountains – including @entity3 ’s @entity2 , which was set to be a centrepiece of the @entity18 after a £ 200,000 refit – will be turned off this weekend when their current supplies run out			1
while there have been two years of chronic low rainfall , enough water for 20million people is leaked by water companies every day			2
yesterday the @entity149 revealed bosses of water companies which are imposing hosepipe bans took home £ 4million in bonuses in the last financial year ( 2010 - 11 ) , including those who failed to meet leakage targets			1
