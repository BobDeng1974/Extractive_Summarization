by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 14 july 2013 their stone tools may have been simple and their dwellings made from simple straw huts , but ancient @entity5 were in fact ahead of the times - literally - when it came to the world 's first ever calendar			1
that 's the claim of archaeologists who believe they have found evidence of a giant ' year clock ' capable of tracking lunar months and the changing seasons in a field near @entity18 in @entity19			1
dating back 10,000 years , it is twice the age of time - keeping systems created by the ancient @entity22 , which were thought to be the world 's oldest			2
time keepers : an ancient calendar found in a field near @entity18 in @entity19 , dates back 10,000 years speaking to the @entity29 , @entity27 , professor of landscape archaeology at @entity28 , said : ' the capacity to measure time if among the most important achievements of human societies and the issue of when time was " created " by humankind is critical in understanding how society developed			1
' @entity27 and his team analysed the findings of previous excavations at @entity41 , which had once been home to a @entity45 ( middle @entity44 ) settlement in @entity46			2
a series of pits , perhaps used to hold large posts or stones , mystified archaeologists at the time			0
but the @entity28 academics found the pits were aligned with key astronomical events , such as the phases of the moon and the midwinter sunrise			0
a full report will be released tomorrow , but among their findings is evidence suggesting this calendar could track the mid-winter sun. many early calendars were designed to track calendar months , but could not tell users when a year had passed			1
this is because the lunar calendar differs from the amount of time taken for the @entity71 to orbit the sun. ancient tribes failed to recognise this and so their calendars became increasingly out of step with the time of year as shown by the sun. ancient clock : stonehenge in @entity79 , which dates to @entity80 may have been used to track time the @entity44 inhabitants in @entity19 however noticed this problem and used their calendar to work out when the mid-winter solstice had arrived			1
they then used this information to ' reset ' the lunar clock system			0
@entity27 said : ' the monument anticipates problems associated with simple lunar calendars by providing an annual astronomic correction in order to maintain the link between the passage of time , indicated by the moon , and the asynchronous solar year and associated seasons			0
' the use of a calendar also suggests the inhabitants of @entity41 were not just hunter - gathers but had something of a settled existence and wanted the ability to track time			2
it is close to the @entity107 , where fish supplies were plentiful , and in the middle of forests full of game			0
right on time : the @entity112 was used by @entity114 civilisations before @entity115 @entity27 added : ' this suggests that early hunter - gatherer societies in @entity118 had both the need and ability to track time across the years - and perhaps within the month - and that this occurred 5,000 years before the first formal calendars were created in @entity122			1
the @entity41 calendar predates a number of time tracking methods including @entity126 , built in @entity127 and which may have been used to track time			2
it is also older than the @entity129 , established before @entity115 and the 365 - day @entity130 , introduced by roman emperor @entity131 in @entity132			0
@entity131 's legacy : the roman emperor introduced the 365 - day @entity130 , which included leap years			0

@entity5 had a calendar 5,000 years before @entity22
evidence found in @entity41 , near @entity18 in @entity19
a pit *structure* , which may have held posts or stones tracked lunar months
early calendar was also used to work out mid-winter solstice
