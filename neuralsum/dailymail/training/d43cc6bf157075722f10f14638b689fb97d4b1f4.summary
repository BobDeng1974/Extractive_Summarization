by @entity0 published : 11:00 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 17 october 2013 from chipmunks to @entity5 spiders , animals are evolving to cope with the effects of hotter temperatures , a scientist has claimed			1
dna evidence suggests the @entity10 wasp spider is evolving into a new form and is moving to cooler regions to set up home in parts of northern @entity10 , while chipmunks living in @entity17 park in @entity18 are moving to higher , cooler altitudes , a biologist claims			1
the scientist believes that the changes are due to the effects of global warming and as habitats move , populations of animals that have previously not crossed paths , are mixing and have the potential to spread and adapt in new ways			1
scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in @entity17 and found that over 100 years , the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees @entity36 systems biologist @entity37 , of the @entity38 and the @entity39 at the @entity40 in @entity41 , said animals are already feeling the heat from global warming and are having to adapt			1
writing for @entity45 , he said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures by moving to higher latitudes and altitudes			2
dr @entity37 said global warming is in effect a large evolutionary experiment that is causing huge genetic changes as creatures rapidly adapt or become extinct			2
with lots of land and marine creatures moving into new territories , scientists are concerned about what will happen when they meet , as it could dramatically change ecosystems and food chains			0
they are turning to genetics to try and predict the present and future impact of global warming , by studying dna in a scientific field called landscape genetics			0
dr @entity37 cited the work of a team of scientists at the @entity78 as an example of how creatures are adapting to warmer temperatures			0
dr @entity37 said scientists tracking the movements of animals have repeatedly found that plants and animals have altered their behaviour in response to earlier springs and milder temperatures by moving to higher latitudes and altitudes the scientists studied alpine chipmunks living in @entity17 and found that over 100 years the animals have moved to higher altitudes as the average temperature of the park has risen by three degrees @entity36			1
while there is an argument that the creatures are adapting to global warming , their numbers in the area have declined , causing some experts to question if they are simply on a fast - track to extinction in the region			0
the researchers compared dna from historical specimens of the species collected in 1915 with contemporary chipmunks and discovered evidence of genetic erosion			2
in effect , the alpine chipmunk population is breaking up into isolated , genetically - limited groups and losing diversity in their dna , which makes them more vulnerable to disease and natural disasters such as drought			0
' the chipmunks ' poor prospects are evident in their genes , ' wrote dr @entity37			2
dna evidence suggests the @entity10 wasp spider ( pictured ) is evolving and has colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates			1
the spiders primarily lived in @entity5 regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise @entity126 , @entity127 and the @entity129 region dna evidence also suggests the @entity10 wasp spider is evolving and have colonised new areas as they seek cooler climates			1
the spiders primarily lived in @entity5 regions until the 1930s but have gradually crept northwards to colonise @entity126 , @entity127 and the @entity129 region			0
interestingly while scientists thought they were trying to find new places to live that were the same temperature as the @entity5 before temperatures have risen , the spiders have actually moved into regions that are cooler than their original homes			1
the reason for their behaviour is they have been mating with spiders that like the cold , to create an invading species that can survive freezing temperatures that would kill its @entity5 relatives , researchers from @entity140 's @entity139 told dr @entity37			0
they believe this cross-breeding is taking place as populations of spiders are mixing in regions where they would never have met before .			0

biologist @entity37 of the @entity40 said animals that have previously not crossed paths are breeding to adapt
