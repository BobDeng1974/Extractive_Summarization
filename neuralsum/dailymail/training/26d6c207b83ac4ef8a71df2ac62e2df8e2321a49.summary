the search giant also advises people who have had laser eye surgery to check with their doctors			1
the warnings come amid growing concern over the safety of looking at the tiny screen all day			0
today they called for @entity0 to improve the security on the device before it goes on sale to the public next year how @entity28 ' @entity2 is n’t for everyone , ' the firm says on a web site for the gadget , which is currently only available to a handful of developers			1
' like when wearing glasses , some people may feel eye strain or get a headache			2
' if you ’ve had @entity41 surgery , ask your doctor about risks of eye impact damage before using @entity2			1
do n’t let children under 13 use glass as it could harm developing vision			0
' @entity0 has also banned those under 13 from connecting @entity2 to their account			1
it also revealed customers who struggle with health issues will be given a refund			0
' if @entity2 is not for you and you wish to return it , do so before the end of the applicable refund period , ' it said			1
it also claims that internal tests have given it ' no cause for concern '			0
' it ’s something we ’ll continue to watch carefully , ' a spokesman said			0
' we have been working with ophthalmologists throughout our development process			0
' dr. @entity68 , a professor of opthalmology at @entity70 who has been ' offering advice and guidance ' to the @entity2 team , said ' all told , the results we see so far are encouraging '			1
' as with regular eyeglasses or a new spectacle prescription , some people 's eyes take a bit longer to adjust to these systems			0
' dr. @entity82 , a clinical spokesperson for the @entity83 , told @entity84 the experience of wearing @entity2 was similar to reading a small print book			1
' other than feeling a bit uncomfortable or getting a headache from this ... there 's no evidence that this would do permanent damage to your eye , ' he claimed			2
however , he believes it could lead to eye dryness			2
i know what you did ... researchers have demonstrated how to ' hijack ' @entity0 glass and use the video camera and microphone @entity104 , a tech blogger , has already tweeted a picture of himself in the shower with @entity2 - but experts warn ' private moments ' could be seen by hackers hackers claim that with access to @entity2 , which is claimed to take just a few minutes with a device to obtain , they could : record audio and video at any time photograph keys to make copies watch online passwords being entered see and letters being read or written see door codes being tapped in the health concerns come after it emerged @entity0 's @entity2 wearable computer have been hacked so video and audio can be transmitted online to anyone			1
hackers have been able to remotely watch and hear everything a wearer does , and today warned ' nothing is safe once your @entity2 has been hacked			1
' although @entity2 does not go on sale to the public until next year , the attack raises major security and privacy questions over @entity0 's plans for the device			1
' once the attacker has root on your @entity2 , they have much more power than if they had access to your phone or even your computer : they have control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head , ' wrote @entity156 , a well known programmer who has previously developed hacked to bypass security on iphones and @entity160 handsets			1
' a bugged @entity2 does n't just watch your every move : it watches everything you are looking at ( intentionally or furtively ) and hears everything you do			1
' the obvious problem , of course , is that you might be using it in fairly private situations			0
' the only thing it does n't know are your thoughts			0
' the hack uses a known bug in the @entity160 software that runs of the @entity2 , a modified version of the @entity160 softare also found in @entity0 's mobile phones			1
' sadly , due to the way @entity2 is currently designed , it is particularly susceptible to the kinds of security issues that tend to plague @entity160 devices			2
' the obvious problem , of course , is that you might be using it in fairly private situations. , ' said @entity156			0
he also believes the camera could easily reveal other passwords			0
' however , a more subtle issue is that , in a way , it also hacks into every device you interact with , he wrote			0
hackers posted this image of a @entity2 screen to prove they had hacked the system the tweet that revealed the hack ' it knows all your passwords , for example , as it can watch you type them			1
' it even manages to monitor your usage of otherwise safe , old - fashioned technology : it watches you enter door codes , it takes pictures of your keys , and it records what you write using a pen and paper			0
' nothing is safe once your @entity2 has been hacked			1
' @entity0 stressed the gadget is not yet available to the public			0
' we recognize the importance of building device - specific protections , and we 're experimenting with solutions as we work to make @entity2 more broadly available , ' it said in a statement			2
' it 's also important to understand that @entity2 does n’t access many parts of a @entity222 , including settings or many products			2
' and your personal @entity226 site allows you to change the content that you see on @entity2 or , if you misplace it , wipe all the data off your device			2
' @entity233 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity235 , said : ' the danger with @entity2 is that the camera is seeing what you see , all the time , while the microphone allows nearby conversations to be eavesdropped on			2
' it is impossible to guarantee against these devices being hacked , so it would be surprising if people are allowed to wear them anywhere like @entity249 buildings or in businesses that handle sensitive intellectual property			0
' while it ’s still dangerous to have a situation where someone could use glass without permission from the other people who are being monitored by the device , the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip			0
' @entity2 offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while @entity0 ’s main interest is selling advertising , there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device			2
' the only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them			0
