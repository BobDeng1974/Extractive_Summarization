they are even putting in food colouring , despite the fact dogs are colour blind			1

@entity36 , a former pet industry nutritionist , has found a product advertising as a ' succulent moist chicken ' meal - but it contains just 4 per cent chicken			1
the @entity40 and vegetable meal details on its ingredients lists unidentified ' meat and animal derivatives in the chunk ' as making up 26 per cent , with chicken making up just 4 per cent			0
mr @entity36 has set up a new website , whichdogfood.co.uk , to inform dog owners about the food we feed our four - legged friends			1
he claims that the additives and fat in pet food is contributing towards dogs ' obesity and behavioural problems , including hyperactivity			1
mr @entity36 , who used to work as a nutritionist for a number of pet food companies , said : ' for so long , pet food manufacturers have been able to get away with producing , frankly , awful foods for our pets			1
' the most successful foods in the @entity66 all have two things in common - low grade ingredients and elevated prices			0
' most consumers simply are n't aware that alternatives exist and the health problems that low grade foods often bring are so widespread that many pet owners simply disregard them as a normal part of a dog 's life			1
labels do not give us nearly enough information about what is in the cans we buy each week , campaigners say ( stock picture ) ' so many dogs are living short , problem - filled lives and nobody is blinking an eye			2
' his claims are dismissed by multinational giants - including @entity92 and @entity93 - which dominate the Â£ 500million - a - year industry			2
and some vets are also sceptical			0
the @entity96 said dogs have adapted to eating almost anything so do not need to pay as much attention to their food as humans			1
@entity102 , the association 's president , told the @entity104 : ' my advice to my clients is you can feed most dogs most things			0
' they are scavengers so i do n't get as precious about diet as some might because they have coped with an incredible variety of foods over thousands of years			0
' ' @entity93 and @entity92 have paid some people a lot of money to formulate diets and the chances are they will make a better dog food than you will			2
' he said that the dog obesity is due to feeding dogs too much , rather than the wrong things , as well as a lack of exercise			2
a spokesman for @entity40 , which is owned by @entity92 , said : ' regarding the 4 per cent declaration , this is a pet food industry - wide labelling requirement			1
' that does n't mean there is only 4 per cent of that meat in the food			0
' our recipes will also contain other meat proteins such as poultry , turkey and lamb			0
these will be classed as ' meat and animal derivatives ' rather than listed individually to allow for supply fluctuations during the year depending on availability and in some instances the seasons			0
' @entity151 @entity66 - which owns @entity152 - said : ' @entity151 is globally recognised for its expertise in pet nutrition			0
' our understanding of the needs of pets is based on 50 years of scientific research from the @entity159 , which is the world - leading scientific authority on the health and nutrition of pets and continues to advance the frontiers of our knowledge on pet nutrition			0
' in the @entity66 our main - meal wet pet foods contain up to 60 per cent meat and animal derivatives and our dry food range contains approximately 20 per cent			2
' owners who feed their pets a complete @entity152 meal can have confidence that they are fulfilling their pet 's nutritional needs			0
