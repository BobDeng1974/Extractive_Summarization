club secretary @entity41 , 26 , who is himself deaf , said : ' most lads feel officials are not geared - up for a deaf team due to communication breakdowns , which cause difficulty			1
' the referees are supposed to wave flags while , at the same time , blowing a whistle			2
most referees forget to wave or simply do n’t want to use a flag			2
' it was mainly due to poor commitment from our lads as the average age of the team was 22 and our oldest player is 30			0

also , we have 36 players on our books			0

when the half time whistle blew they knew nothing about it			0
