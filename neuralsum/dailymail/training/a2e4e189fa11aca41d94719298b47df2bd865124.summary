@entity0 is spending millions to put a man into space – as @entity3 hands it more than £ 1billion in foreign aid			1
the oil - rich country , which has accepted £ 300million this year alone , has set in train ambitious plans to launch its own rockets			1
and the first @entity0 astronauts are being trained to join @entity13 , @entity14 or @entity15 missions within the next two years			1
space race : a @entity0 engineer at work on one of the country 's satellites developed in a @entity3 laboratory last night critics asked why @entity3 was , in effect , subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per cent of people live below the poverty line			1
this latest controversy came just two days after @entity30 mep @entity30 ignited a fierce debate by saying it was folly to give billions in aid to ‘ @entity34 ’			1
big spending : @entity0 has already launched these surveillance rockets from @entity13 as part of its plans to join the space race yesterday @entity40 said the remarks were offensive and accused mr @entity30 of being guilty of a ‘ stop the world i want to get off ’ approach to foreign aid			1
the £ 1.14billion @entity0 will receive over the five years of the @entity46 is double the £ 500million set aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our own hospitals			1
backbench @entity52 mp @entity51 said it was ‘ totally unjustifiable and unaffordable ’ for @entity3 to give this money to @entity0 , given the scale of its ‘ grandiose ’ space programme			2
‘ we can not go around the world saying “ do n’t worry , we will feed your public for you while you waste your money on all sorts of other projects ” , ’ he said			0
‘ we have got to say to these countries “ you have got to spend that money on your people where it ’s most needed not on some grandiose space programme ”			0
we are against welfare dependency at home but at the same time we are encouraging welfare dependency abroad			0
’ the row surrounding mr @entity30 flared when he insisted that sending aid to @entity75 was tantamount to treason			1
he added : ‘ how we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month , when we ’re in this sort of debt , to @entity34 is completely beyond me			2
’ he claimed foreign leaders frittered the money away on ‘ @entity82 sunglasses , apartments in @entity84 and @entity85 ’			0
poverty : millions of @entity0 are living in poverty , despite the country earning huge profits from its oil deposits resources : @entity0 generates millions in oil revenue every year but much of the population lives in poverty he was widely criticised for using the term ‘ @entity34 ’ but many commentators believe he was right about the building resentment over spiralling foreign aid			1
the @entity102 ’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015			0
but while aid costs are ballooning , spending on the military , the police , border control and care homes is being slashed			0
@entity3 is also spending about £ 280million a year on aid to @entity111 , another country with its own space programme			1
despite @entity0 having the second - highest national income of all @entity75 countries , most of its people still live in poverty			1
it is also mired in corruption			0
the most modest estimates suggest between £ 2.5 and £ 5billion is stolen from the state ’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians			2
debate : @entity128 mep @entity30 has reignited the issue of @entity3 's foreign aid contributions with his infamous ' bongo bongo land ' comments @entity134 from the @entity135 ’ @entity133 , said : ‘ when budgets are tight both for families and the government alike , people can not understand why ministers are sending more and more of our hard - earned cash overseas			1
‘ taxpayers find it especially unacceptable when their money is sent abroad as aid to developing countries which then somehow find sufficient cash to fund the likes of a space programme			0
‘ it is totally unacceptable that @entity3 taxpayers ’ money is effectively subsidising @entity0 ’s efforts to send an astronaut into space			0
’ @entity0 ’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit			0
it now has three in space , @entity162 , @entity163 - 2 and @entity0 - @entity164 , the first to be constructed by @entity0 engineers			2
although it has bought its own satellites and launched on @entity13 rockets , @entity0 has built laboratories which it hopes will produce its own space craft by 2028			0
the @entity170 confirmed @entity0 astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two years			1
in july this year , @entity170 ’s director general , professor @entity173 , declared : ‘ by our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared by 2015			0
before the end of the year , the recruitment of astronauts will begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can pick from that number			0
’ the @entity0 government has not released detailed figures on how much it is spending on its space programme , but it is thought to be hundreds of millions of pounds a year			2
@entity3 aid to @entity0 will increase by 116 per cent under the @entity46 government , from £ 141million in 2010/11 to £ 305million in 2014/15			1
it amounts to a total of £ 1.14billion over five years			0
response : the prime minister @entity40 said mr @entity30 's remarks showed a ' stop the world i want to get off ' approach to foreign aid the country has also been criticised for failing to crack down on corruption			1
the only senior figure from @entity0 to have been prosecuted over corruption in recent years was jailed by a @entity3 court			2
@entity198 , the former governor of the country ’s oil - rich @entity199 , was sentenced to 13 years for money laundering , forgery and fraud totalling nearly £ 50million			1
he used the money to live a lavish lifestyle , buying a house in @entity208 worth £ 2.25million and luxury cars worth over £ 650,000			0
last night a spokesman for the @entity102 said spending aid money in @entity0 would help cut crime and illegal immigration in @entity3			2
‘ no @entity3 aid money goes through the @entity0 government , ’ she said			2
‘ our investment goes into specific health , education and poverty reduction programmes			0
@entity0 is home to a quarter of the poorest people in @entity75 , and supporting their development will benefit our own trade and security			0

oil - rich country has accepted £ 300million in aid this year alone
plans for @entity0 astronauts to join missions within next two years
