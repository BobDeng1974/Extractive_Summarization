the world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change , scientists have warned			1
@entity7 researchers claim that the fast onset of global warming is set to alter the way people live , even over short time scales			2
this is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 ° c per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years			1
new evidence suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 ° c per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years			1
the @entity21 ( purple ) will be have the most dramatic increase , followed by @entity24 ( brown ) , @entity26 ( black ) and @entity27 ( red ) the analysis , based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world , looked at the rate of change in 40 - year long time spans			1
' we focused on changes over 40 - year periods , which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human - built infrastructure such as buildings and roads , ' said lead scientist dr @entity43 , from the @entity44 in @entity45			1
' in the near term , we 're going to have to adapt to these changes			2
' overall , the world is getting warmer due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions that trap the sun 's heat			2
but , given natural climate variability over short times scales , the likely effect of global warming over humanly relevant periods such as the length of a person 's life is not so well understood			2
' we focused on changes over 40 - year periods , which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human - built infrastructure , ' said lead scientist dr @entity43 , from the @entity44 in @entity45			1
the graph shows the predicted changes under different scenarios of climate change the new study started off by calculating how fast temperatures changed between 1850 and 1930 , a period when the amount of fossil fuel gases collecting in the atmosphere was low			2
this was compared with temperature data for the past 2,000 years obtained by studying tree rings , corals and ice cores and predicted 40 - year rates of change between 1971 and 2020			1
over the 900 years preceding the 20th century , 40 - year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1 ° c per decade , the study found			1
but by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25 ° c per decade , give or take 0.05 ° @entity85 different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years			1
dr @entity43 added : ' in these climate model simulations , the world is just now starting to enter into a new place , where rates of temperature change are consistently larger than historical values over 40 - year time spans			0
' we need to better understand what the effects of this will be and how to prepare for them			1
' the findings are published in the journal @entity105			0
the @entity106 and @entity107 has detected warmer than average water temperatures around the equator of the @entity110 ( shown above ) which indicates the arrival of @entity112 the world is finally in the grip of a long - awaited @entity112 event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected			0
@entity112 is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the @entity110 around the equator			0
scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central @entity110 and have started to alter wind patterns			0
the @entity126 now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance @entity112 will continue through the summer			0
however , they say that the @entity112 conditions are currently ' extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of @entity112 on weather patterns usually declines			0
the @entity126 said that it was unlikely the phenomenon would bring enough rain this spring to break the three - year record - breaking drought that is currently affecting @entity138			0
some meteorologists , however , have warned this @entity112 could combine with another slow movement of water in the @entity110 called the @entity142 ( @entity143 )			0
the @entity143 reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with @entity112 to increase global temperatures .			0

rate in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 ° c per decade by 2020
@entity150 is more than *double* the 900 years preceding the 20th century
the warning was issued by the @entity44
they say we need to better understand what the effects of this will be
