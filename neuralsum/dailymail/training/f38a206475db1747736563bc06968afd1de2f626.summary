the prime minister is to give intelligence agencies the power to vet airline flight lists in an effort to stop jihadis entering @entity6			1
the @entity8 - style laws would compel all airlines flying into the country to provide much more information about passengers			1
if the name of a traveller appears on a ‘ watchlist ’ the plane may not be permitted to land in the @entity6 unless the person is stopped from boarding			1
at present , some airlines do not release their passenger lists until 30 minutes before flights leave			1
there will also be a push to share more data on passengers , but this will run into difficulties in the @entity39 parliament on civil liberties grounds			2
the airline flight lists measure is among a number of emergency powers which will today be unveiled by @entity44			1
it follows a warning by the king of @entity48 that terror groups could attack in the @entity50 within a month			1
he said : ‘ if neglected i ’m sure they [ terrorists ] will reach @entity39 in a month and @entity8 in another month			0
the evils of terrorism must be fought with force , reason and speed			0
’ at the centrepiece of mr @entity44 ’s plans will be a temporary ban on @entity6 citizens from coming home if they have travelled to fight alongside @entity65 fanatics			1
@entity44 is to unveil new measures to stop extremists re-entering @entity6 after fighting abroad this would stop short of stripping suspects of their @entity6 citizenship and making them stateless – a breach of international law – but at the same time prevent them from re-entering			1
under existing laws , the government has the power to block only foreign nationals , those with dual citizenship or naturalised citizens			0
mr @entity44 and deputy prime minister @entity81 were last night thrashing out the final details ahead of a statement in the commons this afternoon			1
they acted after intelligence chiefs raised the @entity6 ’s terror threat level to ‘ severe ’ – the second highest level – after warnings that a jihadi atrocity was ‘ highly likely ’			1
a temporary ban is likely to require major changes to air transport legislation			2
a @entity95 source said : ‘ we need to make sure this is legally robust			0
it is a difficult thing to achieve , putting a temporary ban on people without making them stateless , but it is vital we achieve it			0
’ ministers are also considering strengthening @entity105 and @entity106 – so - called @entity107 – which replaced control orders			0
the government is also expected to make it easier to seize the passports of potential terrorists to prevent them travelling to trouble - zones			0
so far , 23 potential jihadis have been barred from leaving			0
under the plans , border guards would be allowed to revoke a fanatic ’s passport			0
defence secretary @entity120 said new measures were needed to deal with ‘ gaps in our current armoury ’ against terrorism			0
at least 500 people from the @entity6 are thought to have gone to fight in @entity127 , but the number could be as high as 2,000			2
security chiefs believe some 250 have already returned home and may have been brainwashed into launching strikes here			2
up to 20 @entity6 are believed by @entity133 authorities to be waiting in safe houses for instructions to cross into @entity127			2
intelligence and anti-terror specialists are also examining entry records of all @entity6 to @entity133 , cross-checking those who have left , how long they stayed and those who have overstayed the 90 - day visa period			2
some are said to be using the passports of fellow fighters of similar age and appearance to avoid detection			0

airlines would be forced to *handover* more information about passengers
flights containing travellers on ' watchlists ' may be prevented from landing
comes as king of @entity48 warns terror strikes could be *imminent*
@entity44 set to unveil range of new security measures today
