by @entity0 last updated at 7:57 am on 28th december 2011 @entity2 's health secretary has appealed for calm in an attempt to quell growing fears over breast implants that have been sold to countries including @entity8			1
@entity9 admitted conflicting information about the products made by the now bankrupt @entity12 was having a devastating effect			2
last week @entity2 said it would pay for women to have the industrial silicone - filled implants removed because they were liable to split open			1
burst : plastic surgeon @entity18 holding defective silicone gel breast implants , which were removed from a patient mr @entity9 said : ‘ it ’s true this is not of an urgent nature , ’ but he added : ‘ we recommend that the breast implants are removed to avoid a rupture			2
’ in @entity8 , the government has said women with the implants should not be ‘ unduly worried ’ because there was no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture			2
some of the 40,000 @entity8 women who have the implants are planning legal action , and concern is mounting among the 30,000 in @entity2 who have them			2
a global search is continuing for @entity43 , the 72 - year - old former butcher who founded @entity12			2
it has emerged that in 2000 the @entity45 warned him about 11 deviations from ‘ good manufacturing practices ’ at @entity12 ’s plant in @entity50 in the south of @entity2			1
@entity52 launches manhunt for breast implant ' butcher ' @entity12 ( @entity55 ) was told in 2000 that its saline implants were ' adulterated ' - a decade before it came under scrutiny from @entity59 regulators for its silicone implants			1
more than 300,000 women who received the company 's silicone implants , which were ordered off the market in 2010 , have already been told they are at risk			1
and now thousands more women who received its saline implants are facing potential safety issues			1
but it is not yet known how many received the implant or whether indeed they are unsafe			0
in a warning letter to company founder @entity43 it said there were 11 deviations from ' good manufacturing practices '			0
dated june 22 , 2000 , it cited @entity12 's failure to investigate the deflation of its saline implants and a failure to report more than 120 complaints in @entity2 and elsewhere to the @entity45			1
threat : the ' low quality ' pip implants contained industrial silicone - designed for computers and electronic devices - instead of medical - grade fillers it also said the plant did not have a process in place to make sure the saline implants it produced met design specifications			1
the revelation has led to questions as to why the warning did not prompt a larger investigation by @entity2 authorities			1
@entity12 began selling its saline implants in the @entity101 in september 1996 under a system that did not require the company to submit clinical trials to show an implant 's safety and effectiveness			1
@entity12 - once the third - largest maker of breast implants in the world - stands accused of using industrial - grade silicone in some of its implants			1
there are fears that the implants , which were sold around the world , could cause health problems if they burst or leak			2
it has affected 40,000 @entity8 women and 300,000 worldwide			2
the @entity2 government has urged the 30,000 women in @entity2 with @entity12 implants to have them removed - and offered to pay for the surgery			1
other countries , including @entity8 , have only gone as far as saying that women should visit their surgeons for checks			0
concerns about their safety first surfaced 18 months ago , when surgeons noticed they were rupturing much more quickly than other brands			0
the @entity2 health watchdog ordered an inquiry , which subsequently reported ‘ serious irregularities ’ in the implants and they were pulled off the market			0
manufacturers were accused of fraudulently using a non-approved silicone gel for almost 10 years which believed to have been originally designed for mattresses			0
they have a higher than normal rupture rate - up to five per cent among @entity2 women - and have been linked to the death of a @entity2 woman from a rare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( @entity148 ) , and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases			0
it has also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coating designed to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body			0
it was feared that leaked gel could trigger cancer but to date tests have remained inconclusive			0
about 300,000 @entity12 implants were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year			1
this was as long as it was ' substantially equivalent ' to devices already on the market			0
the @entity2 company could not sell its silicone - gel implants in the @entity101 at the time because the @entity45 had prohibited the sale of all such implants from 1992 until 2006 for most women because of safety concerns			1
but , for many years , the @entity45 allowed manufacturers to sell saline implants without formal safety trials			0
this was because many were sold before the agency received the authority to regulate medical devices			0
the agency assumed they were safe unless proven otherwise			0
in 2000 , due to concerns about possible complications such as infections and rupturing , the agency finally required all implant companies to submit a formal application , known as pre-market approval , to continue selling their products			0
@entity12 was one of three companies that submitted an application , which came under review of a panel of outside advisors to the @entity45 in march 2000			2
at the time , @entity12 said it had already sold 35,000 of its pre-filled saline implants in the @entity101 , and that it was the third - largest manufacturer of breast implants in the world			1
it said it only had reports of 521 complaints with its devices , a rate of 1.5 per cent			0
but the panel recommended that the @entity45 reject @entity12 's application			1
it recommended the implants from the other two companies , @entity209 , now part of @entity211 and @entity212 , now a unit of @entity214			0
panellists said at the time they were not reassured by @entity12 's data , and that the company 's clinical trials did not include enough patients that were followed for an adequate time to truly evaluate the device 's risks			1
one panel member , @entity223 , a plastic surgeon from @entity224 , said the company 's data was incomplete , and he found it difficult to understand why the company was ' as ill prepared as you appear to be ' to meet regulatory standards			0
he told the firm : ' like it or not , we have a regulatory threshold which is probably higher or at least different than it is elsewhere in the world , and i think in order to get your product approved , you 're just going to have to bite your tongue and meet that threshold			0
' asked to comment on the @entity12 controversy , @entity223 , in a brief interview , said that he stands by the prior comments he made to the @entity45			0
it was not immediately clear why after the rejection , the @entity45 then carried out an inspection of the @entity12 plant in may 2000			2
@entity12 said it stopped selling its saline implants , which usually contain a silicone outer shell filled with a sterile saltwater ( saline ) solution , in the @entity101 that same month .			1
