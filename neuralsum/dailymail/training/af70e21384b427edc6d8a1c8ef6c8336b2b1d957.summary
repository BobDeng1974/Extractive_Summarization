@entity3 would n't have enjoyed the wine himself however , because he was famously teetotal			2
the bottle was given to a @entity46 prisoner of war by a @entity11 soldier after the war and has remained in the same family ever since			1
@entity3 famously did not drink alcohol but gave the wine to his top military officers the bottle contains a stamp of the @entity32 , the central office that supplied @entity35 equipment , and the wine is described as @entity40 , meaning ' black table wine ' @entity3 had little to celebrate in 1943 , as @entity60 forces turned the tables on the @entity62 in @entity63 and on the @entity64			1
in april 1945 , just days after his 56th birthday , @entity3 shot himself in his underground bunker at the @entity67 in @entity68 as @entity70 forces advanced			0
the bottle has a wax seal and a label carrying an image of an eagle on top of a swastika the wine , which has been verified by historians , has emerged just days before the 125th anniversary of @entity3 's birth in @entity82			1
it is expected to fetch £ 2,000 when it is sold following an online auction ending on april 21			1
@entity85 , from @entity86 in @entity87 , said : ' the bottle was consigned to us by a @entity46 man whose father had procured it during @entity93 ' the owner 's father was taken as a prisoner of war and when he returned home he was given this bottle by a @entity11 soldier			1
it has been in his family ever since			0
' @entity3 commissioned the red wine to be made for his 54th birthday to give as presents to his general staff			1
' he was so self obsessed that he called the wine @entity14 and insisted the label carried a picture of himself on it			0
' the wine was possibly produced in @entity11 and would not have been amazing when it was bottled , but now it would be completely undrinkable			2
' two years after it was made @entity3 was dead and the war was all but over			2
the bottle is a 1.5 - litre magnum which is very rare			0
' i think that the bottle is an important historical artifact - it is certainly not a bottle that you would come across very often , if at all			0
' a @entity11 gun which was adapted by @entity125 secret services for an audacious plot to assassinate @entity3 is now on display in @entity128			1
the @entity130 pistol - specially adapted with a @entity125 - made silencer - had been set to be used during the @entity93 in a bid to kill the @entity35 leader at his holiday home in @entity135			1
the plan was eventually ditched in late 1944 after @entity125 intelligence disagreed over whether killing the @entity35 leader at that point in the war was a sensible strategy			2
the specially - silenced @entity141 was to be used by a sniper who was going to be dropped behind enemy lines the pistol is now proudly on display as part of the @entity147 at the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity128			0
@entity150 , historian at the museum , said : ' i think this is a really interesting sideline to history			0
it 's interesting to think what would be different if they had gone ahead with the plan			0
' the assassination attempt - code named ' @entity160 ' - was put together after a captured @entity11 guard revealed @entity3 enjoyed a morning walk every day whilst staying at his holiday hideout in the @entity164			2
@entity3 would wander unguarded for around 20 minutes from the @entity165 to a local teahouse at around 10am each morning			0
historian @entity150 believes the plan never went ahead because @entity3 was making so many mistakes at the time , it was better not to kill him an @entity173 sniper and a @entity175 soldier , who spoke fluent @entity11 , were set to be disguised as @entity11 mountain troops and parachuted in close to @entity3 's residence in @entity178 , @entity11 , to shoot him as he went for his morning walk			1
the sniper was equipped with a @entity180 for the sniper shot as well as the specially - silenced @entity130 pistols to kill anybody who uncovered the plot			0
the plan had been set to go ahead around the time of the @entity187 in june 1944 but was eventually scrapped			0
it is believed intelligence chiefs in @entity125 disagreed over whether killing @entity3 was a good idea , with some claiming he was a bad strategist and feared he might be replaced by a better leader , and others believing he could become a martyr to @entity35 forces , who would become more difficult to defeat			2
the firearm has now gone on display in the @entity147 at the @entity148 in @entity149 , @entity128 other secret murder plots considered included bombing @entity3 's personal train or poisoning the water supply			1
the @entity147 is a unique collection of weapons used and captured by the @entity203 during the 19th and 20th centuries , assembled by @entity205			0
mr @entity150 added : ' these pistols were @entity11 but were caught from the enemy during the war			0
' only 10 of the @entity130 pistols were ever specially adapted by the @entity210 ( @entity210 ) for the mission and we have three on display here			0
' @entity11 's did not use silenced weapons so @entity125 - made silencers were added to the pistols			1
' there are thought to have been more than 25 attempts to kill @entity3 between his rise to power in the 1930s and his death in 1945			0
the most famous is the so - called ' july 20 plot ' , when senior officer , colonel @entity226 ( pictured right ) , planted a bomb at the leader 's @entity229 headquarters			2
the plot was planned to coincide with a seizure of power in @entity68 , but failed when @entity3 was only concussed and burned in the blast and the military coup failed			0
the botched plan lead to the arrest of around 7,000 people believed to have been involved and the execution of around 5,000			0
colonel @entity226 was played by @entity241 in a 2008 film adaption of the episode , called @entity244			0
in an earlier attempt on @entity3 's life , the @entity247 of 1938 , another group of high - ranking @entity11 officials planned to storm the @entity251 building			1
but the plan relied on strong @entity125 opposition to @entity3 's seizure of the @entity255 and after then - prime minister @entity256 signed a peace deal with @entity3 the plan fell away			1
in a later assasination bid , a major general @entity259 attempted to kill @entity3 as he flew back from field headquarters near @entity262 in @entity263 , on 19 february 1943			2
he handed a bomb , disguised as a box containing two bottles of cognac , for a friend in @entity11			0
but the device failed to go off because it was placed in the cargo hold of @entity3 's plane , where it is believed to have been too cold for the detonator to work .			2
