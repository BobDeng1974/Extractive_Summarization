by @entity0 published : 10:30 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:40 est , 27 february 2014 as the cold weather continues to bite , everyone is looking for ways to reduce their heating bills while staying warm			2
and now an ‘ intelligent heating system ’ that claims to save people 40 per cent on heating costs could help			2
@entity10 allows users to control their heating room by room using a smartphone app that can even turn the heating on or off if a person forgets to do so in the morning			1
the @entity10 system creates up to 12 ' zones ' in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures ( pictured )			1
for example , someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little - used spare bedroom the @entity10 device could save a homeowner up to 40 per cent on their heating bills , according to @entity29			1
however , the system is an investment as the hub itself costs £ 249			1
in order to create zones , devices that attach to radiators are needed , which cost £ 77 each			1
one room typically constitutes a zone and would need a radiator device in each space			2
so for a house with four zones , there would be an initial outlay of £ 529			2
someone could use the main device on its own to be able to turn their heating on and off using the app , but to use the ' zone ' feature , they would need to invest in the radiator devices			1
the system creates up to 12 ‘ zones ’ in the home that can be controlled individually to set different temperatures			2
for example , someone might want their living room to be cosier than a little - used spare room			2
zones can be created by attaching a small device to a radiator in a room that ' talks ' to the central hub			1
the main device even ‘ learns ’ how a house heats up and cools down so that the system can adapt accordingly			0
it can react quickly if a window is left open too			0

but the device itself , which has a touchscreen and comes in a range of colours costs £ 249 to start with			1
the hub on its own allows users to switch their heating on and off remotely using the app , but to use the ' zone ' feature , they would need to invest in radiator devices too , which cost £ 77 each - and one is needed per ' zone ' or room			1
