@entity1 manager @entity0 has confessed his academy players are not ready to step into his first - team squad , hinting that @entity1 may look to cherry - pick the best youngsters from their top - flight rivals			1
in the week that @entity8 ’s @entity7 spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at @entity11 , @entity0 ’s comments suggest that @entity1 may look to invest heavily in other teams ’ homegrown talent this summer			1
@entity15 regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players , which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an @entity22 club			1
@entity24 chairman @entity23 is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12			0
@entity0 says the academy players at @entity1 are not ready for the first team @entity0 's assertions may mean @entity1 buy @entity22 players like @entity7 to reach homegrown quotas @entity33 's @entity32 international midfield player @entity31 has also been linked with @entity1 but the lack of suitable candidates emerging from @entity37 ’s academy means @entity1 ’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota , with the defending league champions also linked with @entity43 ’s @entity42 and @entity31 of @entity33			1
@entity1 ’s current group of home - grown players will be reduced in the summer when @entity47 departs and it could be further depleted if @entity48 , who wants guarantees of more regular first - team football , opts to leave			1
coincidentally , @entity8 is @entity48 ’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of @entity7 moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate @entity1 his most likely destination next season			1
@entity1 ’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity			2
@entity64 defender @entity63 , who has started nine league games in nearly six years at @entity1 , is the only former academy player anywhere near first - team contention			1
@entity0 said : ‘ we must be patient with the academy			2
maybe it ’s not so easy for young players , especially at big clubs , to play in the first team , with the professional squad			2
but i ’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy			0
@entity48 could leave @entity1 in the summer with @entity8 a potential destination @entity43 midfield player @entity42 has also been linked with a transfer to @entity1 defender @entity63 ( right ) is @entity1 's only academy player near first - team contention ‘ but it ’s important to have years of working the same way			1
maybe some talented young players can do it soon			0
’ @entity7 would fit the bill , if his impasse at @entity8 proves unsolvable , although @entity0 refused to comment directly about the @entity8 and @entity32 forward			2
@entity0 said : ‘ i think it ’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players , that ’s the most important thing			1
if they ’re all good players , of course i agree with the quota			0
all the big leagues — especially the @entity15 — need the best players to play			0
’ @entity1 ’s homegrown quota is made up of @entity63 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity100 , reserve keeper @entity101 and @entity102 , who qualifies from his years spent with @entity43			1
they are joined by four academy players — @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , although @entity108 is the only one to have been near the first team this season			2
a number of young @entity1 professionals , including @entity113 at @entity114 , @entity116 ’s @entity115 and @entity117 with @entity118 , are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season , although a big investment in @entity22 talent via the transfer market seems the only option			0
@entity47 helps make up @entity1 's homegrown quota but is leaving for @entity125 at the end of the season @entity37 is overseeing the @entity1 academy 's production of youth and homegrown players striker @entity113 is on loan at @entity114 but could return to meet quota regulations next season meanwhile , @entity0 is not in action until monday , when he takes his team to @entity138 , and with @entity139 in an apparently commanding lead at the top , the city manager admits his side face eight cup finals			1
he said : ‘ i hope we can do it			0
we have to play eight finals from now until the end			0
we will see the way we play			0
i hope the way we finish against @entity150 is the way we must continue			0
‘ it is not easy to make a clear analysis because they play with one player less			0
i hope in these eight games we continue playing that way			0

@entity0 believes his youth players are not ready for the first - team
his homegrown quote will be depleted when @entity161 leaves
@entity0 may lose @entity48 , forcing him to invest in home talent
