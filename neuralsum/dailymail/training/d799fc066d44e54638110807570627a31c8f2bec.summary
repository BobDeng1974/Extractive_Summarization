by @entity0 lunch appointment with @entity2			1
@entity4 sort of spot : @entity7 area of @entity8			0
the old @entity11 president 's conversation topics were as catholic as usual : judges , whose ranks he half - wished he had joined rather than been lured by motor racing from an early career at the bar ; newspaper editors and proprietors , whose journals he has waged war upon ; @entity21 , his old mucker who finds himself in a spot of bother with the @entity24 constabulary			1
but it was on the subject of @entity28 's engine development that he made his most pertinent contribution			1
in the thick of the action : @entity31 leads the field on the run down to turn 1 at the @entity35 @entity34 opinions : @entity2 met with @entity0 he clearly felt that the sport 's current governors might have articulated the need for energy recovery era more forcefully			1
' if anybody should be " blamed " it 's me , ' he said wryly of the move to @entity46 turbos this seasons			1
' we were the ones who looked at bringing in the new technology			0
it was 10 years in the making , and i actually like the noise			0
' i wear these things in both my ears ( hearing aids ) because the noise of the engines went right through me for 40 years or more			0
it 's too late to save my hearing but not for the next generation			2
the quieter engines are better for families			0
you can take children to races without fear of their being deafened			0
' it is important for @entity28 to evolve			1
safety was the big challenge of the @entity71 and the environment is the big challenge of the 21st			0
if that that fact is not understood and embraced , the sport runs the risk of becoming irrelevant			0
' corporate social responsibility is important for car manufacturers , so there is a need to move in this direction so the sport does not lose sponsors and manufacturers			1
they see how important this technology is in the development of road cars			2
over the line : @entity31 celebrates his victory in @entity35 after holding off @entity92 team - mate @entity91 ' if there is one thing i feel could have been done better it is how the new regulations , and the reasons behind them , have been explained to the public			0
an opportunity has been missed			0
' a few points to consider			0
first , he turned upside down @entity21 's argument that louder engines are obviously desirable , saying that quieter power trains are not only a necessary by - product of less energy being expelled through the exhaust but that the tranquillity is desirable in itself			2
he cited watching the sheer violence of a car going round the swimming pool at @entity114 , rather than the high - decibel screech , as the truly jaw - dropping spectacle			0
i agree that watching from the pit wall at @entity114 is one of the greatest sights in all sport , and i stop there every year to take it in			2
secondly , he argued that @entity28 is not shying away from being the most innovative and startling brand in motor racing by moving to a greener world but actually defining the new frontiers by doing so			1
complaint : @entity129 has been very outspoken in his criticism of the new @entity28 era thirdly , he underlined the fact there would only be one or possibly two engine manufacturers left had the move to energy - saving technology not been brought in			1
@entity92 , for one , said this week they probably would have quit had the move not come about			2
@entity138 would have wobbled , too			0
despite these and other worthy points to be made for the new regulations , the agenda through the opening months of the season was set by the antis , notably @entity144 's @entity129 , @entity146 's world champion @entity145 and , of couse , @entity21			2
where was the case for the defence from the sport 's governors , as opposed to @entity92 ' @entity153 and , to an extent , @entity156 's @entity155 ? their argument was barely presented , certainly not with the force or coherence it could have been			2
instead , the telling rebuttal was delivered , by proxy , through the splendid racing at @entity35 last weekend			2
but even that evidence , by its nature , failed to make the intellectual case for the revolutionary changes			0
another chance to articulate this vision was , i fear , missed this week when the @entity11 launched its carbon reduction programme			1
the project was a long time in the planning but was launched with little more than a murmur			0
the opportunity to join the dots with what is happening in @entity28 was wastefully scorned			1
as for @entity2 's views on @entity21 's longevity , he believes his old friend will survive the bribery charges in @entity24			1
or was that just loyalty talking ? centre of attention : @entity21 will be tried on bribery charges in @entity190 later this year back on the pit wall : @entity156 chief @entity155 pictured at the @entity35 @entity34 the @entity192 – the name given to @entity28 's school of sharp - toothed bosses – should be warned that @entity2 has finished his memoirs			1
i am told that about 10 per cent of the book , which has yet to be given a title , will address his upbringing as the son of sir @entity202 and @entity203 ; 25 per cent his campaign to curtail the @entity205 following the @entity206 expose into his private life ; 65 per cent his experience in and around @entity28			1
a particularly intrigued piranha will be @entity155 , whose designs on a knighthood are unlikely to be helped by another rehearsal of the @entity214 scandal , concerning how @entity156 came into illicit possession of @entity144 technical data in 2007			0
other big fish who could also be wounded by @entity2 's scabrous pen are @entity144 president @entity129 and triple world champion sir @entity220			1
the author , during his period as @entity11 president , derided them respectively as a ' bella figura ' and a ' certificated halfwit , dressed up as a 1930s ' @entity228 man			1
if i were a modern - day @entity230 – that is to say richer than i am – i would put some money towards the motor racing career of @entity236 's son , @entity235			1
with his collar - length blond hair , @entity235 looks every inch his world champion father 's boy			2
he also possesses something of the late @entity236 's debonair style			2
so it was one of the pleasures of the week to meet up with @entity235 in a @entity247 hotel after his return from a spell in @entity250 , close to the animals he loves			0
up for the cup : @entity236 celebrating victory at the @entity255 like father , like son : @entity258 at the @entity259 last year and , right , during a photo shoot he told me how he spent @entity262 crossing the @entity263 , 15,000 feet up , sometimes holding on to rock faces for dear life , at other times pausing to breathe in the thin air every 10 steps			1
he managed just over 50 miles in fractionally fewer hours but had to turn back when there were no horses to take him across the water			0
the cowboys were on a day off			0
it was @entity262 , after all			0
but , his head cleared and straight , he is back in @entity277 in an attempt to restart his racing career seven years after he began out in @entity280			1
aged 26 , he admits his original aim of @entity28 is beyond him , so is now hell - bent on a crack at @entity283			1
the road to @entity283 , through lower categories , will likely take five years at best , and plenty of money			0
so if anyone fancies helping @entity235 on his journey , he can be contacted on @entity290 , @ @entity291			0
@entity293 i am willing to publicise other drivers seeking sponsorship , on only two conditions : first , that they are the son of a formula one world champion and , secondly , they represent some of the panache missing in modern @entity277 sport .			1
