@entity0 was the victim of a ' @entity2 ' dismissal during @entity3 's one - day international - and the perpetrator was controversial @entity6 spinner @entity5			1
@entity0 , the new golden boy of @entity8 cricket , was run out by the bowler backing up			1
the fact he was out of his crease meant the dismissal was legitimate - especially as the batsman was twice warned in the spinner 's previous over			1
despite being legal it is seen as some as against the spirit of the game and the fact it was @entity5 - who was reported for a suspect bowling action the day before the match - only added controversy			2
not in the spirit ? @entity25 appeals for the run out of @entity0 at the non-striker 's end the bowler is permitted , before releasing the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing , to attempt to run out the non-striker			1
whether the attempt is successful or not , the ball shall not count as one of the over			0
if the bowler fails in an attempt to run out the non-striker , the umpire shall call and signal @entity41 ball as soon possible			2
@entity42 playing conditions @entity44 shall be replaced by the following : the bowler is permitted , before he releases the ball and provided he has not completed his usual delivery swing , to attempt to run out the non-striker			2
whether the attempt is successful or not , the ball shall not count as one of the over the practice is named after @entity52 @entity2 , who ran out the @entity54 @entity53 during a @entity55 in 1947/48			2
the act infuriated by @entity54 and has been known as ' @entity57 ' ever since			0
the dismissal sparked quite a reaction , with @entity61 tweeting : ' i think if i 'd been called for chucking i 'd try to keep a low profile for a while rather than pull out the mankad ! ! ! incredible scenes ! ' he later added : ' to be clear on this i think the mankad is just wrong even though it 's not illegal			1
like cuddling your sister whilst watching a film			0
' former @entity3 captain @entity71 waded in with his opinion and his ire was aimed at @entity6 skipper @entity74			0
captains usually decide to call the batsman back in these instances but @entity74 did not and @entity71 tweeted : ' totally blame the captain ... he is the man who makes the decisions and should have over turned the decision ... no way to play the game ... ' ah , go on ! @entity5 tries to persuade the umpire to give @entity0 run out and was eventually successful former @entity3 captain @entity84 added : ' the spirit of cricket has been broken but @entity6 are within their rights to uphold the appeal			1
the laws of the game allow this dismissal			0
' @entity94 all - rounder @entity93 raged : ' that is absolutely rubbish			0
ca n't get @entity0 out normally that they have to do that			0
' and former @entity99 and @entity100 footballer @entity98 - a good junior cricketer - gave his two penn'orth , saying : i got run out like that once - greemount vs glodick away i was 11 playing in 3rd xl - it nearly started a full scale riot ! ! ' @entity3 were all out for 219			1
off you go : umpire @entity106 gives @entity0 out after he was ' mankaded ' by @entity5 Ã‚			0

@entity0 run out backing up at the non-striker 's end after one warning
some see ' @entity2 ' dismissal as against spirit of cricket but it is legal
@entity61 , @entity71 , @entity84 and @entity98 had a say
