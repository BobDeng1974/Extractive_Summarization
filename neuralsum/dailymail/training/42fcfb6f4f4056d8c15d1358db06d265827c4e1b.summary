with less than 10 months to the next general election , politicians are keen to make a good impression on the public			2
if the findings of new research by consultants the @entity4 are anything to go by , they have a lot of work to do			0
one thousand voters were shown photographs of each main party leader and asked for an instant reaction			1
twenty - nine per cent of potential voters were ' frustrated ' by the prime minister compared to @entity19 who left 24 per cent frustrated and 21 per cent who felt the same way about the @entity29			0
deputy prime minister @entity19 will be shocked to find that 21 per cent of respondents find him ' disgusting ' , just ahead of his boss on 20 per cent with mr @entity21 trailing on 10 per cent			0
none of the three leaders inspired positive thoughts among the polled voters – @entity21 's ' net emotional resonance ' score was -32			2
mr @entity19 suffered the worst score of -51			0
@entity39 ( with the wine bottle ) : ' people have conflicting emotions about him ' @entity39 , the leader of @entity43 and possible future mp for @entity45 , did well with 19 per cent of voters being ' intrigued ' by him			1
the final report says : ' results confirm the apathy and anonymity political leaders engender in the public — the largest proportions said they felt ' nothing ' or ' frustrated ' , even ' disgusted '			0
' @entity39 is different because people have conflicting emotions about him ... he is five times more intriguing than @entity18 and @entity19 and twice as intriguing as @entity21			1
' the big question is whether people will vote for a politician they find intriguing			1
@entity39 stands out from the pack , who appear to be receding into neutrality , which is worrying in a democracy admired around the world			2

poll of *1,000* voters makes *unhappy* reading for party leaders
shown politicians ' photograph and asked for instant reaction
@entity39 did well but *pollster* wonders if people will vote for someone they find ' intriguing '
