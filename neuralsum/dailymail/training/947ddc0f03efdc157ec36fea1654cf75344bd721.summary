what could be more heart - breaking than for your beloved dog to disappear one day , never to return , and for you never to find out what happened ? but that is what is now possible as a result of a decision by the @entity9 ’ @entity10 , which used to stipulate that any dog found dead on a major road should be checked for identification and , where possible , the owner informed of the animal ’s fate			1
to save costs , the agency ’s new contracts do not include such mandatory checks , although any driver who hits a dog is required by law to report the incident to the police			1
keeping them close : devoted @entity27 cuddles two of her chihuahuas clearly this does n’t always happen , which is what led @entity33 from @entity34 to spend 13 agonising weeks searching for her miniature poodle @entity37 , who had gone missing while she was visiting friends			1
eventually she was told by a kind @entity42 that @entity37 had been found dead on the @entity43 only 20 minutes after he had gone missing			1
if only someone had told her at the outset , it would have saved her three months of desperate anxiety and the £ 8,000 she spent on living in a caravan close to the search area			1
that ’s how much an owner can love a dog			1
it ’s for that reason she is calling for the @entity56 to introduce a ‘ @entity62 ’ to require compulsory scanning of any domestic animal found on a road and make sure a report is filed with the police			1
it will seem ridiculous to anyone who does n’t understand what a dog can mean to its owner to make a comparison with a child , but i ’m going to do it with my dog			1
no one would dream of suggesting that a child hit by a car should simply be disposed of without anyone being required to inform the parents and , i believe , the same caring attitude should apply to the demise of a dog			1
i know exactly what @entity33 went through when @entity37 disappeared without trace			1
my first dog was a corgi - cross called @entity86			1
after much pestering and endless reading of @entity91 ’s @entity90 , @entity87 finally relented and @entity86 , a tiny , ginger pup with floppy ears and a long waggy tail , was my fifth birthday present			2
we walked in the woods and loafed in the garden			2
he chased the balls i threw and sat when i told him to			1
he was not , unlike @entity91 ’s @entity102 , allowed to sleep on my bed , but i did sneak him into the bedroom and he lay on the rug by my side			2
microchips can be used to identify a lost or dead dog and notify families for an only child he was the most devoted and constant companion			1
he was never cross with me , always deliriously excited to see me ( he even went to the door when he knew i was due home ) and , as i grew into a teenager , he was my confidant			2
he listened intently as i poured out my troubles and licked me profusely as a comfort			2
he always knew when i was worried or sad			2
he was desolate when i went away to university			2
he was 13 years old and @entity87 would always include his moods in her letters			1
‘ taffy miserable — looking forward to the end of term ! ’ i missed him terribly			2
it was when i came home at @entity123 in my third year that there was no enthusiastic welcome from @entity86			2
he ’d gone out through the back door the night before and had n’t come home			2
@entity127 initially joked he ’d probably found a girlfriend , but i knew instinctively he had n’t gone out temporarily			1
there was an air of finality about his disappearance			0
i spent the entire @entity123 fruitlessly hunting around the area , sorrowfully weeping at the thought that he may have been hit by a car or locked into someone ’s shed and could be cold , hungry or in pain			1
at the end of the holiday i had to return to my studies and never knew what happened			0
@entity127 said he ’d probably gone off to die quietly in a ditch because he was old and did n’t want to upset me by dying in front of me or having to go to the vet for a lethal injection			0
i was inconsolable and for years felt the absence of the dog i ’d loved so much whose end remains a mystery			1
i remember my grief as if it were yesterday			0
it was 44 years ago			0
it was two or three years before i plucked up the courage to have another dog			1
a friend of my first husband , @entity157 , had a yellow @entity158 which had pups			0
we took one and called him @entity163 after @entity157 ’s favourite tipple — the whisky , @entity163			0
he was a similar colour			0
there ’s no doubt in those early years of marriage he was something of a child substitute			0
road workers are no longer obliged to check the collar or microchip of a dog that has been run over – and bodies can be disposed of without worried families being informed we played with him and walked him in every spare moment			1
he was loyal and , like @entity86 , always an unconditionally welcoming presence when we returned home			0
we were careful never to let him out on his own , but one day , i popped out to the garden to pick some flowers , let my concentration slip for just a second and he was gone			0
i chased after him , calling his name , but he ignored me and was much faster than i was			0
he was heading for the main road			0
by the time we had organised to get in the car and hunt for him there was a knock on the door and a shocked , white - faced man explained his car had hit our dog			1
he said that he ’d found our address on his collar and was sorry but thought @entity163 was dead			1
we hardly knew what to do			0
we picked up his blanket , drove to where the man had told us he ’d left him and found his lifeless body at the side of the road			1
there was n’t a mark on him , but it was obvious the impact had killed him outright			0
we called the vet who simply told us to take him to the rubbish tip. i cradled him as my husband drove and when we arrived at the tip we met the same callous attitude demonstrated by the vet			1
‘ oh , just dump it over there ’ said one of the workmen			0
‘ we ’ll incinerate it later ’			0
it was a terribly thoughtless way to deal with two young people whose grief was palpable and we both wept all the way home			0
there have been other dogs since			0
in fact , i ’ve never been without them			0
now my beloved babies — yes , i openly admit they ’re child substitutes now my children are grown up — are the chihuahuas @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 and i learned a hard lesson with @entity86 and @entity163			0
my three are micro-chipped , never allowed out alone — except into my completely dog - proofed garden — and never permitted to run free on a walk except in the wilds of the countryside far from any roads			2
and so , i support the call for @entity62			0
losing @entity163 was heartbreaking , but we were grateful to the driver who ’d taken the trouble to set our minds at rest			0
it ’s true that it ’s better to know the worst than to spend a lifetime wondering — and , surely , a civilised country can spare the small sum of money needed to make that possible .			0
