a group of conservatives are banding together in the @entity2 to oppose @entity6 @entity5 @entity4 's reelection to speaker in retaliation for a budget deal leadership supported at the end of last year			1
a half dozen @entity5 , including @entity11			1
@entity12 of @entity13 and @entity14 of @entity15 , have said they wo n't vote for @entity4 in tomorrow 's speaker election			1
@entity18 lawmaker @entity17 on sunday put his name forth as a challenger			0
@entity4 has little chance of losing the gavel , as it would take a defection of nearly 30 members of his caucus to put his position in jeopardy			1
the last time disgruntled conservatives and tea partiers tried to take out their party leader , they ultimately mustered just 10 @entity5 votes against him			1
house speaker @entity4 is pictured here on @entity34 last month			1
conservatives are trying to oust him from his leadership post but his office does n't seem to be worried ' rep. @entity4 was selected as the @entity41 's choice for speaker in november , and he expects to be elected by the whole @entity2 next week , ' the congressman 's spokesman , @entity38 , said in a statement , writing off the insurgent effort			1
still , the vote will be a key indicator of just how much negotiating it will take for @entity2 @entity5 leaders to keep their members in line over the next several months as party gets its first opportunity in @entity55 president @entity54 's tenure to sideline him			1
beginning tomorrow , @entity5 will make up majorities in both chambers of @entity58 for the first time since @entity54 was elected after picking up nine additional @entity61 seats in november			1
no sooner had the votes from the midterm elections been tallied before @entity5 were arguing among themselves about what to do with their new powers			2
the first preview of @entity5 leadership of @entity58 came in mid december when the legislative body was under the gun to pass appropriations legislation or see the government shut down			2
the @entity2 was only able to pass a $ 1.1 trillion compromise spending bill that funded the government through the end of the fiscal year , with the exception of @entity76 , which it put on a shorter leash , after president @entity54 rallied @entity55 to support the measure			1
conservatives in the @entity2 refused to attach their names to the bill over ire at @entity54 for giving millions of illegal immigrants safe haven in the @entity87 had they had it their way , the bill would have included language restricting the @entity54 administration from using immigration funds to register illegal residents of the country for work permits			2
alternatively , conservatives lobbied for legislation that would have short - term funded the entire government through february , giving their party more leverage over @entity54 once @entity5 elected in november were seated in @entity58			2
@entity4 's decision to join forces with the opposition party to pass the spending bill did n't sit well with conservatives , and over the holiday break separating the previous legislative session with the 114th @entity58 , they began plotting a rebellion			1
' while i like speaker @entity4 personally , he will not have my support for speaker , ' @entity14 said in an op - ed in @entity116			1
' our current leadership was recently tested when mr. @entity54 attempted to circumvent @entity58 and the law by unilaterally granting amnesty to illegal immigrants by presidential decree			0
his decree provides illegal immigrants with work permits , legal status , and free federal entitlements			0
but on a much more significant front , his action shows a complete disregard for our constitutional system where @entity58 makes the laws and the president 's duty is to enforce them			0
the recently elected lawmaker , who defeated former house majority leader @entity135 in a primary election last summer and joined @entity58 early after @entity135 resigned , blasted @entity4 for allowing funding for ' illegal amnesty ' to be allowed in the spending bill and for going to @entity2 @entity55 to get the votes he needed instead of members of his own party			1
' @entity146 is broken in part because our party 's leadership has strayed from its own principles of free market , limited government , constitutional conservatism , ' brat wrote			2
@entity18 lawmaker @entity17 said sunday that he would challenge @entity4 unless a more viable @entity5 jumps in the race			2
' at this point , the speaker ’s election is not about a particular candidate , ' he said			0
' it is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands ' on sunday , in announcing his candidacy for speaker , @entity17 also cited the spending bill controversy			1
' after the november elections gave @entity5 control of the @entity61 , voters made clear they wanted change			0
' there have been numerous examples of problematic @entity5 leadership , but we were hopeful our leaders got the voters ’ message			0
however , after our speaker forced through the @entity180 by passing it with @entity55 votes and without time to read it , it seemed clear that we needed new leadership , ' he stated			1
@entity17 said that he 'd ' heard from many supporters and also friends in @entity58 who have urged me to put forward my name for speaker ... to increase our chances of change ' yet said he 'd be open to voting for another one of his colleagues instead			0
' at this point , the speaker ’s election is not about a particular candidate			0
it is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands , ' he said			0
' i am putting forward my name for consideration as speaker and hope that with a new speaker , be that me or someone else , we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in november			0
' @entity210 congressman @entity209 , one of a cadre of republicans who voted against @entity4 in the last election for speaker , provided similar reasons for his resistance to the @entity6 lawmaker 's reelection			1
' our vote for a new speaker is not a personal vote against representative @entity4 — it is a vote against the status quo , ' he said in a @entity225 post			2
' our vote is a signal to the @entity87 people that we too , have had enough of @entity146 politics , and that we will stand with the @entity87 people			0
' in this jan. 5 , 2011 photo , @entity2 speaker - designate @entity4 of @entity6 wipes away tears as he waits to receive the gavel from outgoing house speaker @entity235 of @entity236 , during the first session of the 112th @entity58 , on @entity34 in @entity146			2
@entity4 was unanimously elected to speaker by @entity5 four years ago today so far , @entity240 's @entity239 , @entity242 's @entity241 , @entity244 's @entity243 and @entity13 's @entity12 are the only other @entity5 to say they would not vote for @entity4 tomorrow			1
' we need a speaker who will help us all keep our oath , including his own , to the @entity248 , not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours , ' @entity12 said in a statement			0
' i will vote for an alternative candidate for speaker			0
i ca n't vote for @entity4 again			1
' however , a handful of new representatives that include @entity257 and @entity258 of @entity259 , @entity260 of @entity18 , @entity261 of @entity262 and @entity263 of @entity240 have suggested in the past that they would not support @entity4			0
and @entity266 rep. @entity265 , @entity268 rep. @entity267 , @entity270 rep. @entity269 and @entity271 lawmakers @entity272 and @entity274 have all voted against @entity4 in a past election or recently expressed dissatisfaction with his leadership			2
@entity5 hold a 246 - seat majority in the @entity2 and @entity4 only needs 218 votes to prevail over @entity55 leader @entity235 and his conservative challengers if all 435 members of @entity58 were to vote tomorrow			1
one vote that will go uncast is that of @entity284 rep. @entity283 , whose resignation takes effect today			0
other members of both political parties could show their agitation with their side 's leaders by abstaining			0
but refusing to vote merely lowers the threshold for reaching a consensus			0
at the start of the 113th @entity295 received 220 votes for speaker and @entity235 garnered 192			0
but only 426 members voted , making 214 votes necessary to reach a majority			0
if @entity4 had n't won outright , voting would have gone to a second round , giving conservatives an opportunity to ignite a revolution .			2

speaker @entity4 's decision to join forces with the @entity55 party to pass the spending bill did n't sit well with conservatives
a half dozen members of his own caucus have said they wo n't vote for him in tomorrow 's speaker election
@entity4 has little chance of losing the gavel , as it would take a defection of nearly 30 members of his caucus to put his position in jeopardy
the last time disgruntled conservatives tried to take out their party leader , they ultimately mustered just 10 @entity5 votes against him
