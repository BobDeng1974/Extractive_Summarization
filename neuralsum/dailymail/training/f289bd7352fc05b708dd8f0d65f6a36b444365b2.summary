the alleged crimes came to light in 2011 after police raided the @entity11 caravan site and the @entity31 were charged with offences related to servitude and forced labour ' these were individuals who were not missed and became conditioned to the control of these @entity33 family members who exploited them to make huge sums of money			1
' when we entered the @entity11 site in september 2011 we found victims who had been with members of the @entity33 family for more than 15 years and some who had been with them for only a few hours			1
' the victims were afraid , living in squalid conditions , had no money or belongings , some suffered from malnutrition while others had old fracture wounds that had n't healed properly and one man even had scurvy			1
' in stark contrast , @entity62 , @entity7 , @entity63 and @entity44 were living in almost palatial residencies , had access to whatever they needed or wanted and were free to do as they pleased			2
' having spoken to the victims , we believe that more than 100 people could have passed through the site over the years and there is no telling how much money @entity62 , @entity7 , @entity63 and @entity44 made from forcing people to work for them			1
' i hope that the victims can now begin moving on with their lives and that these sentences send a clear message that behaviour of this nature is completely unacceptable and that we will rigorously investigate and bring to justice anyone who behaves in such a manner			0
