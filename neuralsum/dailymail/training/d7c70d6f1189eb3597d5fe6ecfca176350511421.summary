@entity0 said she was ' obsessed ' by @entity1 @entity1 is ‘ the most appalling role model ’ for young women , a top @entity2 has claimed			1
defence minister @entity0 said she was ‘ obsessed ’ by the @entity5 celebrity because of her body			1
but she insisted the reality tv star , who ‘ broke the internet ’ with a series of fully nude photos last month , did not have a ‘ normal body ’ which ordinary women could aspire to			1
miss @entity0 ’s remarks came in an outspoken interview on @entity17 ’s @entity16 programme this evening in which she also hinted that @entity18 was preying on people ’s prejudices over immigration admitting she has never read a political book , she said : ‘ the big downside of my life is that i do n’t have enough time to read			1
‘ at the moment , i work such long hours i do n’t even have the time to read the paper that i ’ve downloaded on my @entity28 in the morning			1
i do try to read because i am obsessed with @entity1			1
’ she then added : ‘ i think she ’s the most appalling role model			2
somebody who young women aspire to			2
in my opinion , that is not a normal body			1
’ a @entity2 minister – who describes herself as a feminist and a ‘ tough old bird ’ – also risked an angry backlash from conservative colleagues by raising concerns about the prime minister ’s planned crackdown on @entity43 immigration			1
miss @entity0 ’s remarks said she wanted to know why the prime minister had decided to pledge a benefit crackdown on @entity47 workers			1
she said the government should not be ‘ pandering ’ to the view of parties such as @entity55 , and warned there was a risk of ‘ playing to people ’s prejudices ’			2
the prime minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of @entity47 migration by cutting in - work tax credits for @entity43 migrants until they have paid taxes in the @entity61 for four years			1
but miss @entity0 questioned whether people were really coming over here to sign on to benefits , asking : ‘ is that the real problem ? ’ the comments highlight on - going differences in conservative ranks over @entity47 and immigration following the party ’s abject failure to meet its promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands			1
two weeks ago , figures showed that net migration had risen 78,000 over the past year to 260,000 – well above the 244,000 in 2010 and fuelled mainly by incomers from the @entity43			2
in a major speech the day after the embarrassing figures were released , mr @entity18 unveiled plans to deny in - work benefits for @entity43 workers for four years			2
these hand - outs top up low wages and are seen as a key ‘ pull factor ’ for incomers to @entity61			2
‘ i want to know and understand why my prime minister who i have huge amounts of respect for , i genuinely do , i think has done an outstanding job , i want to know why he ’s come to that conclusion , ’ she said			1
‘ is that the real problem , that people might be able to claim benefits ? ‘ there ’s a danger that you create false fear and sometimes you play to people ’s prejudices			2
’ she added : ‘ it ’s really important that we make it clear that the majority of people who come to our country come here to work these are good people			2
‘ just because some people have a particular view , does n’t mean to say that you should pander to it			2
i think we ’ve got to be very , very clear about all of this			0
we ’re obsessing about it			0
‘ the biggest issue in my constituency , it ’s absolutely key marginal , is not immigration , it is the economy			0
the economy will determine the next election			0

asked about the gaffe on @entity16 , she said she ‘ almost forgot that people were actually watching it ’			0
the defence minister also had a run - in with mr @entity153 on @entity161 , when she told him : ‘ you do not talk facts ; you talk prejudice ’			1
yesterday she said that many people had rung her up to complement her on how she had tackled the @entity55 leader			0
among those who rang her , she said , was @entity168 , the prime minister ’s @entity169 strategy chief			1
in the interview she adopted a broad @entity169 accent as she spoke about a phone call she had received from mr @entity168			0
‘ the next day , my mobile went			0
i got : “ it ’s @entity168 here … yeah , what you said last night , absolutely brilliant ”			0
and i said : “ oh wow , great , thanks @entity168 ”			0
‘ the other person who rang me … i was in the pub … you see one of these “ caller unknown ” you think , who is this ? ‘ you get this “ oh it ’s @entity139 switchboard here , could you hold the line ”			0
