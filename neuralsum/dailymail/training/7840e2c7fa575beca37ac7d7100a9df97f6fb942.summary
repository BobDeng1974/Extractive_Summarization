by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:36 est , 17 december 2013 updated : 08:08 est , 17 december 2013 @entity4 prices have soared by 5.5 per cent in a year to a new record high , figures showed today			1
the average home in the @entity7 hit £ 247,000 in october , as the property market roared ahead as the economic growth took hold			2
but amid fears of a new housing bubble in @entity15 , average house prices in the capital rocketed by 12 per cent and now stand at £ 437,000			1
house prices have soared to new record highs , above levels seen before the financial crash demand for houses is dramatically outstripping supply , with not enough homes on the market pushing up prices			0
@entity26 has repeatedly denied that his controversial help to buy scheme , where the government guarantees mortgages to allow people to buy with a five per cent deposit , is driving a new boom			0
in @entity15 alone prices are nearly 17 per cent higher than before the financial crisis levels , while in the @entity36 and the @entity37 they are now around 1 per cent higher than their previous 2008 highs			1
but not every part of the country is seeing the same levels of growth , with prices in @entity44 and the @entity45 up just 0.8 per cent year - on - year and in the @entity46 only 1.3 per cent			2
a house in @entity15 is now typically worth almost three times one in the @entity49 , which has the lowest average house prices at £ 148,000			1
on a year - on - year basis , prices in @entity52 were up 5.7 per cent to reach £ 257,000 on average , by 2 per cent in @entity54 to £ 164,000 and by 3.3 per cent in @entity55 to £ 184,000			1
in the year to october house prices rose by 5.2 per cent , up from 3.8 per cent in september @entity57 , which has previously endured year - on - year falls in house prices of around 10 per cent as the economic downturn took hold , recorded a 4.8 per cent annual increase in prices in october			1
however prices in @entity57 are still 50 per cent below their 2007 peak			0
@entity52 remains the only @entity7 country where property prices are above their pre-crisis high and prices in both @entity55 and @entity54 are still around 6 per cent below their 2008 peak levels			1
fears of a looming house price bubble have been growing in recent months as a flurry of would - be home - buyers has entered the market following @entity76 schemes such as @entity77 and help to buy which have widened mortgage availability			0
@entity77 gives lenders access to cheap finance on condition they pass on the benefits of this to borrowers , while help to buy gives aspiring home - buyers with deposits as low as 5 per cent a helping hand on to or up the property ladder			0
but analysts have warned that the supply of homes on the market is not enough to keep up with demand , which is putting upward pressure on prices as the market heats up			0
there are major disparities between different parts of the country , with prices in @entity15 surging by 12 per cent year - on -- year the @entity104 recently took the first step in applying the brakes to the property market by announcing that it is refocusing funding for lending away from mortgages and towards helping small businesses borrow			1
some experts have warned that this could spell @entity114 for ultra-low mortgage rates			0
@entity116 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity117 , said : ‘ it is important that buyers plan ahead for potential interest rate rises and ensure they can afford their mortgage once this happens			0
’ @entity123 , chief @entity7 and @entity125 economist for @entity126 , said the ‘ sharp acceleration ’ in prices in the @entity132 figures would fuel concerns of a bubble			2
he said : ‘ there is a very real risk that house prices could really take off over the coming months , especially if already significantly improving housing market activity and rising buyer interest is lifted appreciably further by the help to buy mortgage guarantee scheme which was launched in october			2
‘ consequently , the decision of the @entity104 and the @entity141 to end funding for lending support for lending to households from january looks a highly sensible decision			0

prices rise by 5.5 ****%**** in the year to october , up from 3.8 ****%**** in september
@entity15 prices surge by 12 ****%**** , but in the @entity49 values rose by just 0.8 ****%****
prices in @entity52 now higher than pre-crash peaks but rest of @entity7 still lags
