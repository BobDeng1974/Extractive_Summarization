you 're listening to a playlist on ' shuffle ' when you notice three @entity4 songs have played back to back - what are the chances ? while some dismiss this as a coincidence , others claim that so - called ' random ' playlists are n't random at all			1
instead , they say , music services are conspiring against listeners to promote tracks			1
it 's a criticism that @entity15 has faced , and as a result the music service has had to change its algorithms to fit the human brain 's warped idea of ' random '			1
@entity21 - based @entity15 admits it had to change its playlist algorithm to be less random in order to trick its users into hearing what the believed to be random songs			1
the graphic shows different genre songs ( labelled in various colours ) spread out evenly to fit the human expectation for ' random ' in @entity15 's new algorithm ' on my 442 song playlist , the same 30 or 35 tracks play over and over again and the other 400 songs i have barely heard once , ' one user wrote on a @entity15 forum			1
' it 's almost unbelievable to me that such a simple process is broken , ' another user wrote			2
' the only remaining explanation i can give is that @entity15 deliberately chooses the songs that are cheaper for @entity15 to pay royalties			1
' but @entity15 has denied these allegations			1
instead , it says , it 's all in our heads			2
' our brain is an excellent pattern - matching device , ' said @entity49 , a lead developer at @entity15 , in an interview for @entity51 on the @entity52			1
' it will find patterns where there are n't any			2
' @entity15 realised that our brains actually want to see what we consider ' random ' – or different genres of music spread evenly over a playlist			1
@entity15 's algorithm – which is anything but random – uses the length of a playlist and records how many of each type of song it contains the human brain is designed to notice coincidences			1
it is also programmed to expect something to happen if it has n't occurred in a while			0
for instance , people often think that if they have n't won anything in a scratch card lottery a couple of times in a row , they should have bigger chance of winning the next time			2
this phenomenon is called @entity83 's fallacy and it 's the same fallacy that lead to the mistake about playlists not being random			1
' if you just heard a song from a particular artist , that does n't mean that the next song will be more likely from a different artist in a perfectly random order , ' says @entity15 on its blog			1
' the problem is that , to humans , truly random does not feel random , ' said @entity96 , a @entity15 software engineer , in a response on the question - and - answer site @entity99			1
ask one to flip a coin 30 times and write down the sequence of heads and tails			0
the other will imagine flipping a coin 30 times and also write the sequence of results			0
they do this in secret , so you do n't know who has flipped the real coin and who has flipped the imaginary one			0
the ' wow ' moment comes when you 're presented with the two lists of heads and tails and it 's usually instantly obvious which is which			0
the first list is properly random			0
the second is a human attempting to be random			0
you can tell the difference because humans are very , very bad at faking randomness			0
we just ca n't do it			0
there are different ways to tell the fake and real randomness apart , but the most obvious is to look for runs of straight heads , or straight tails			0
if one of the lists has a run of five heads or tails in a row , you can be pretty sure that 's the real coin			0
in a list of 30 coin flips you 're reasonably likely to get a run of five			0
when someone is imagining coin flips , however , they almost never imagine a run of five straight heads or tails			0
this is because after two or three heads our brains tend to think , ' ok , time for a tails now			0
' our brains are implementing an order , a ' coin memory ' , whereas in fact true randomness has no memory of what came before			0
@entity165 creates counter-intuitively large clusters , such as a run of five heads in 30 flips of a coin , which leads to unexpected results			0
' so we got tons of complaints from users about it not being random			0
' last year , we updated it with a new algorithm that is intended to feel more random to a human			2
' @entity15 realised that our brains actually want to see what we consider ' random ' – or different genres of music spread evenly over a playlist			1
@entity15 's algorithm – which is anything but random – uses the length of a playlist and records how many of each type of song it contains			1
if there are five @entity193 songs in the playlist , they will appear at 20 per cent intervals			2
perfectly random means that the following two orders are equally likely to occur ( different colours represent different artists )			0
however , to the human brain the bottom row does not appear random for artist 's that only have one song in the playlist , the algorithm makes sure they appear at random intervals , rather than all at the start			1
the algorithm also shuffles songs by the same artist among each other to prevent songs from the same album playing too close together			2
@entity15 is n't the only one who has had to make its playlists less random in order to appear more random			1
in response to complaints from users , @entity219 chief executive @entity218 changed the programming behind its ' shuffle ' feature to make sure each song was significantly different from the last			0
but despite this , some people still see patterns in their playlists			2
' working at @entity15 has taught me a few things , one of them being is that it 's really , really , really hard to build something that a human will genuinely feel is shuffled			1
' people still constantly come up to me at parties and tell me that the shuffle functionality is not random			2

@entity15 was *accused* of making deal with labels to promote songs
but it said patterns people see are *due* to warped *concept* of random
our expectations are based on something known as ' *gambler* 's fallacy '
the group *decided* to change its playlist algorithm to be less random
this meant tracks from different genres were spread evenly when played
