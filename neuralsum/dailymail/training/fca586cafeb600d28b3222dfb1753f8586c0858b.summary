by @entity0 @entity1 is not a man in any hurry			1
the next step he takes in football is a pivotal one and must be taken delicately			0
he was hurt by those chastening 10 months at @entity7 and by the manner of his dismissal four matches from the end of a dismal season			2
he revealed as much in a recent interview with @entity14 when he said : ' the reason i went to @entity7 was because i thought i was joining a club that would give me time			2
that was the big thing			0
' i wanted to take my time working out what i thought was needed			0
it 's not through anything @entity1 has done over the long , empty summer - his first away from football since the age of 16 - but by the unfolding drama at @entity26			1
the poor start to @entity27 's tenure at @entity7 has reflected well on @entity60			1
perhaps succeeding sir @entity41 was and remains the ' impossible job ' , as @entity1 described it in that same interview			2
just one glance at social media following @entity7 's shocking 4 - 0 loss at @entity37 in the @entity47 showed how @entity1 's reputation has been boosted by @entity27 's unconvincing start			1
his beaming smile was everywhere in memes and @entity71 pictures , while one wag created a rather disturbing face morph of the current boss and his predecessor			0
tough times : @entity60 could only guide @entity7 to seventh place in the @entity79 last season mocked : @entity81 fans revelled in @entity7 's failings as they won the title warm welcome : the @entity86 banner on the @entity87 became the centre of attention dissent : the infamous plane message flown over @entity26 calling for @entity60 to be sacked ' it was n't even this bad under @entity1 , ' was the general consensus , while the @entity96 brigade revelled in mocking the latest milestone in @entity7 's decline			1
it was pointed out that @entity1 never lost by more than three goals			2
many pictured him having a little chuckle to himself as he watched the @entity104 side fire in the goals			0
the @entity37 ' kit suppliers even hired a mobile advertising truck to park outside @entity108			0
next to a picture of @entity1 's face , it read : ' bring back the @entity112			1
' of course , it is far too early to judge @entity27			0
he is known as a slow starter in new jobs , is grappling with an injury crisis and has his new signings , including £ 60m man @entity118 , to come in			0
we 're only three matches into the season and @entity27 has a proven track record of winning wherever he has gone			2
to mock him is a very dangerous strategy			0
rubbing it in : @entity37 ' kit supplier @entity125 parked this van outside @entity26 on thursday morning big money buy : @entity7 this week signed @entity118 for £ 60m in an attempt to kick - start their season reinforcement : @entity132 has also been brought in for £ 16m from @entity133 but the point here is that @entity1 is looking better with every @entity7 slip - up			1
perhaps the man who guided @entity7 to seventh in the @entity79 was n't so hopeless after all			2
@entity1 had more points on the board after two games - he won 4 - 1 at @entity36 and drew with @entity141 - and he managed to get @entity7 to the semi-finals of the @entity47			1
there were plenty of fans who could n't wait to see the back of him last season , but attitudes towards @entity1 are softening with events currently unfolding			1
the blame is focused on him less and less			0
the sub-par squad bequeathed by @entity41 was the real problem and @entity1 did n't have the luxury of expensive summer signings			1
@entity27 has overseen spending of £ 131m on four players , so an improvement needs to be seen immediately , starting with saturday 's trip to @entity160			1
there can be no excuses			0
perfect start : @entity1 celebrates during his first @entity79 game in charge , as @entity7 beat @entity36 4 - 1 contrast : @entity27 reflects after @entity7 were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity36 in his first @entity79 game @entity168 blames injuries , errors and luck it all bodes well for @entity1 's future prospects			1
he appears on the bookmakers ' lists for every vacant managerial position and remains highly - regarded despite his bruising experience at @entity7			0
he will find employment again sooner or later and he 'll most likely do a stellar job given time and resources			0
@entity182 heals wounds , histories are revised			0
it could be that the @entity1 era at @entity26 will come to be viewed in a very different light .			1

@entity1 is considering his next move in football after being sacked by @entity7 back in april
@entity192 feels he was n't given enough time to make a difference at @entity26
@entity27 's poor start to the season have led to *sympathy* for @entity1
root of the problem seems to be @entity7 's squad , not the manager
@entity7 have spent £ 131m this summer on new players
