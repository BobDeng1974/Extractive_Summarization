by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 13:19 est , 20 september 2012 the gunman who killed pc @entity3 and pc @entity3 may have carried out the shootings because he wanted to become notorious , detectives believe			1
the policewomen died in a hail of bullets as they investigated a suspected burglary in @entity10 , @entity11 , on tuesday			1
a grenade was also used in the attack			1
police are understood to be investigating the possibility that the person responsible was seeking to become infamous as a police killer			2
theory : police are investigating whether the killer of pc @entity3 ( left ) and pc @entity3 ( right ) carried out the attack because he wanted to become infamous another suggestion is that the gunman may have planned the attack because he believed he may soon be arrested for other offences			1
' one line of inquiry is that the officers were shot dead because the killer wanted to make a big name for himself , ' a source told the @entity33 ' if he ends up in prison , he 'll be one of the top dogs			2
' it emerged yesterday that one of the @entity39 officers may have tried to fire a taser at their killer moments before they were gunned down			2
a 50,000 - volt stun gun was found on the ground at the scene and detectives are trying to establish if one of the officers had attempted to discharge it			1
tribute : @entity11 chief constable sir @entity50 arrives to lay flowers near to the scene where pcs @entity3 and @entity3 were killed an officer weeps at the scene where the two policewomen died after being attacked with a gun and a grenade investigation : police have sealed off the scene while forensics officers attempt to recover fragments of the grenade used in the attack the non-lethal weapon was out of its holster , prompting speculation that one of them had grabbed it before being killed in the gun and grenade attack			1
but the gun and grenade attack happened so suddenly and quickly that officers doubt that the pair had any chance to defend themselves			1
residents reported hearing 13 gun shots before an explosion			2
a taser fires barbed darts with copper cables attached which paralyse suspects for a short time			0
the scene remained sealed off today as forensics officers continued in their task of recovering fragments of a grenade which was used in the attack			1
the head of @entity39 said his officers remained at risk as he could not be sure that all explosive devices had been removed from the area			0
a man weeps as he lays flowers at the scene of the shooting in @entity10 , @entity11 three policewomen and a policeman lay flowers close to the scene where @entity102 @entity3 and pc @entity3 were killed heartbroken : the police force and the community have been devastated by the deaths of the two young policewomen , who were on duty when they died chief constable sir @entity50 said : ‘ we are not confident that we have recovered all the grenades , we do n’t know for certain , so we ’ve made it clear to our officers that the threat is still there			1
' the killings have reignited a debate over whether @entity118 police officers should be routinely armed			1
the brother of shot pc @entity120 and the widower of murdered @entity123 have both called for guns to be given to police			2
@entity126 , whose brother was blinded after being shot by gunman @entity120 in @entity128 - upon @entity129 in july 2010 , said : ' how many officers need to die before the powers realise it is the 21st century ? ‘ no job is a routine job and there is always the potential for conflict			0
we do n’t go on jobs where people are happy to see us			0
pictured : @entity139 is being questioned in connection with the killings of the police officers ‘ i am angry some other families have now lost a daughter , sister , mother or wife and it makes me angry that the thin blue line is getting thinner and thinner			1
' @entity149 , whose wife was gunned down when she attended a botched burglary in @entity152 , @entity153 , in 2005 , said : ' i think policing , as regarding going to scenes of crimes , should be monitored better , and i think police , in honesty , should be armed , walking into situations that they ’re not totally aware of			0
' you ca n’t have armed response at every situation , but i think , as an officer being armed , walk into a situation , feeling more comfortable , walking into that situation , thinking , " i could respond to that situation "			0
' the demands have been rejected by senior officers , however , and home secretary @entity171 agreed that police should not be routinely armed			2
she said : ' the @entity173 have been supporting @entity39 in the work that they 've been doing in relation to this case over the past week and will continue to do so			0
' i 'm clear that every resource that @entity39 needs should be made available to it and forces across the country have been giving support in the work that @entity39 are doing			0
' i think we are clear we have a @entity118 model of policing that is one that our police very much support			0
' i think that routine unarmed policing that goes on in our streets is right			0
i do n't think this is the time to be calling for the arming of police			0
' sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
