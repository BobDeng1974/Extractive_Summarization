over the past week or so i ’ve been speaking to people who knew @entity2 in his early days			1
the @entity3 , of course , will be his 100th , and he needs only four wickets – a morning ’s and evening ’s work with two new balls , perhaps ? – to go past @entity12 ’s @entity11 record of 383			1
but some illuminating discussions left me wishing i ’d had them before – and not waited until cricket ’s statistical @entity15 tapped us all on the shoulder			0
a few themes recurred : @entity2 would n’t say boo to a goose ; he surprised his new @entity23 colleagues by bowling fast and shaping it away ; he was a natural			1
@entity2 needs just three wickets to go level with sir @entity12 as @entity11 's top test wicket taker @entity2 ( back , second from left ) ' would n’t say boo to a goose ' says his old county captain @entity30 @entity2 trains ahead of the first test in @entity32 on monday , which will be his 100th for @entity11 it was this last point that was most striking			1
unlike the majority of @entity11 cricketers , @entity2 did not ease effortlessly through the age groups			1
there ’s even a suggestion @entity23 failed to spot his talent first time round , and needed to witness him at a second trial before they were convinced			2
instead , he played for @entity41 , a club which produced more than its share of first - class cricketers : the @entity45 brothers , @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49			0
so when he was finally snapped up by @entity23 under - 17s , he was very much in the raw			2
@entity52 , who was then @entity23 ’s player development manager , told me that coaches from other counties would pass comment on @entity2 ’s idiosyncrasies , not least his habit of looking at his feet as he delivered the ball			1
the retort was a simple one : @entity2 was bowling fast and getting good batsmen out			2
@entity52 was wise enough to leave him alone , with one exception : at one stage , his back leg started coming behind his body , and he began running on the pitch			0
@entity2 and his first @entity11 captain @entity69 celebrate a wicket during the 2003 @entity71 @entity11 quick @entity2 plays his 100th test match in @entity32 against the @entity73 from monday a session with @entity75 sorted that			1
otherwise , @entity52 allowed @entity2 to blossom , unencumbered by technical advice			2
guess what happened ? as soon @entity2 got involved in the @entity80 set - up , he mislaid his awayswinger			2
it took @entity23 coach @entity83 – once a swing bowler himself – to reacquaint him with some fundamental truths about the art. @entity2 ’s next departure from the natural game that had served him so well came not long after his first taste of senior international cricket			1
from now on , the @entity91 will be shorter , sharper , more regular and maybe even more personal			0
for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin between the end of the home summer in 2004 and the start of the 2006 - 07 ashes , @entity2 played two tests – a disaster in @entity101 and a triumph in @entity103			0
but @entity11 had won the 2005 ashes without him , and he had spent much of the time bowling by himself , at a cone , in some corner of a foreign field or other			0
for @entity11 ’s much - praised fast - bowling coach of the time , @entity110 , @entity2 felt like the one that got away			1
when @entity113 took charge of @entity11 in the summer of 2007 , he encouraged @entity2 to be himself			1
the rest is history ( and that , by the way , is a feather in @entity113 ’s cap that often gets forgotten )			0
@entity113 deserves credit for allowing @entity2 to play his natural game when on @entity11 duty @entity2 has always been at his best when allowed simply to bowl his natural away - swinging deliveries so there you have it			1
the man who is about to become @entity11 ’s leading @entity3 wicket - taker of all time has always been at his best when others have left him alone , when his head has not been filled with well - meaning technical advice , when he has just run in and – heaven be praised – swung it as naturally as breathing comes to you and me			0
there is a lesson here for @entity141 cricket			0
for all the time and money invested at the national academy in @entity146 , @entity11 ’s best bowler has been at his most potent when he has done it his way			2
in @entity149 , the cricket community intuitively understands the importance of this : @entity69 even described @entity2 as ‘ un-english – more like a @entity152 ’			0
in @entity11 , the cricket community errs on the side of over-instruction			0
thank goodness @entity2 stuck to his guns .			0

@entity2 could move past @entity12 's record during first test
@entity2 is just four wickets away from beating @entity12 's tally of 383
the @entity23 fast bowler has always been a natural swing bowler
lowest points of @entity2 's *career* have come with too much *tinkering*
@entity113 deserves credit for allowing bowler to be himself for @entity11
