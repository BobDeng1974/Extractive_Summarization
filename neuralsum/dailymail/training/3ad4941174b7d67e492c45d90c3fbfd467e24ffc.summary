@entity7 , 17 , who said he had made millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures and equities , has now hired a pricey crisis pr firm and battle - tested attorneys to spread the word			1
the @entity16 student was surrounded by his new entourage when he came clean to the @entity18 on monday after his little fib turned into a major international news story			1
it comes as @entity22 , which ran the original interview with @entity24 , including his estimated $ 72million fortune , has admitted it was ' duped ' by the teenager and apologized to its readers			1
now , @entity24 says the claims are n't true apology : @entity22 today admitted it was ' duped ' by the teenager and apologized to its readers in a statement , the magazine , whose reporter @entity42 initially insisted she was shown bank statements showing he is worth eight figures , said : ' as part of the research process , the magazine sent a fact - checker to @entity16 , where @entity24 produced a document that appeared to be a @entity54 bank statement attesting to an eight - figure bank account			1
' after the story 's publication , people questioned the $ 72 million figure in the headline , which was written by editors based on the rumored figure			1
' but in an interview with the @entity65 last night , @entity24 now says his entire story was made up			2
a source close to the @entity24 family told the @entity70 that the statements were falsified			2
' it concluded : ' we were duped			0
our fact - checking process was obviously inadequate ; we take full responsibility and we should have known better			0
@entity1 apologizes to our readers			0
' far from his original claims , @entity24 , president of the prestigious high school 's investment club , now says he traded only using simulated money he made using an online trading program			2
eight figures ? the writer of the article , @entity42 , has come under fire for failing to fact check , but she insisted she saw bank statements backing up rumors @entity24 was worth ' eight figures ' the @entity33 teen told the @entity18 that not only was the $ 72 million totally false , but he 's never made any money in the stock market at all			1
' [ i led her to believe ] i had made even more than $ 72 million on the simulated trades , ' he told the @entity18			0
a firestorm of criticism was unleashed in the wake of @entity24 's retraction on @entity22 and the original article 's author @entity42			1
detractors say the writer failed to do appropriate fact checking for her article			0
the @entity18 's @entity107 writes : ' even if this working - class kid had somehow started with $ 100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at @entity110 , he ’d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796 % over the three years since			2
' @entity114 of the @entity115 took to @entity116 , as many did monday , to demand that @entity42 come up with some answers to how she and her publication managed to pass off the seeming impossibility as fact			2
here goes ... did he show statements ? i have a 15 yr old so i want to believe , ' @entity124 tweeted			0
@entity42 responded to the criticism through @entity116 on monday morning			1
' we saw a bank statement confirming the eight figures , & i 'm comfortable with what 's in the piece , ' she wrote			0
in the wake of the controversy @entity22 added an editor 's note to qualify their now contentious article - which was later edited to include the full apology			1
' our story portrays the $ 72 million figure as a rumor ; the initial headline has been changed to more clearly reflect the fact that we did not know the exact figure he has made in trades , ' the note said			2
' however , @entity7 provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures , and he confirmed on the record that he ’s worth eight figures			2
' going back : @entity24 ( pictured center , in glasses ) who said he had made millions of dollars by trading oil and gold futures and equities , has now hired a pricey crisis pr firm and battle - tested attorneys to spread the word coming clean : @entity24 ( left ) came clean to the @entity18 , but did so surrounded by his new friends so , as the @entity18 and everyone else wants to know : where did @entity42 come up with the $ 72 million figure ? in @entity24 's own words , ' the number ’s a rumor			1
' indeed , @entity42 does not state the $ 72 million figure as fact in her original article			1
regardless , @entity22 has since changed the original headline so as not to reflect that number			0
however , the online bickering began when the @entity175 picked up the story and ran it as fact with the breathless headline , ' high school student scores $ 72m playing the stock market			1
' ' a thing that i have learned today is that @ nypost still drives a remarkable amount of international news coverage , ' @entity42 would tweet monday			2
talking the talk : @entity24 ( pictured giving a high school @entity187 ) told the @entity18 he 's actually never made any money in the stock market at all fighting back : @entity42 says she saw statements backing up the rumors about @entity24 's wealth , but he says they were only rumors and he 's never even traded a stock the house of cards has since fallen for @entity24 , too , of course			1
he was due to appear on @entity200 on monday morning to talk about his fantastical skills on the stock market			0
in light of his new found infamy and no doubt counseled by his new advisers , that slot was canceled			0
and as a teenager , @entity24 still has to face his disapproving parents when he goes home			0
' my mom basically said she ’d never talk to me			0
their morals are that if i lie about it and do n’t own up to it then they can no longer trust me , ' he said in his interview with the @entity18			0
' they knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and i have n’t spoken to them since			0
' school : pictured is @entity16 , where @entity24 claimed he spent his lunch breaks trading stocks			0

@entity7 , 17 , came clean while surrounded by his new friends - a crisis team of @entity233 pros and attorneys
a firestorm of criticism has since been aimed at @entity22 for *printing* a story that appeared to back up the $ 72m claim
@entity22 reporter @entity42 hit back monday claiming they indeed saw documents ' confirming the eight figures ' @entity24 was rumored to have
however , on *tuesday* , magazine *issued* an online apology to its readers
said it had been ' duped ' by *paperwork* appearing to show 8 - figure sum
