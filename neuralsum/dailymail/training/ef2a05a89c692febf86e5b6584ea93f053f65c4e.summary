the days of drones needing to return to base to top up their batteries could soon be over			0
an @entity4 student has shown off a prototype system allowing a craft to land on a power line and recharge itself			1
the smart system uses the magnetic forces emitted by the lines to find the perfect place to perch itself			1
it uses magnetic sensors to find the perfect place to perch			1
the system works using the power line 's magnetic field			1
four metres away from it , sensors in the plane 's nose sense it , and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire , exactly like a bird			0
' small and micro @entity29 have enabled a number of new mission capabilities , including navigatingin and around buildings and performing perch - and - stare surveillance , ' wrote @entity35 , a phd			1
candidate at @entity4 , who is developing the system			1
' however , one of the primary limitations of these small vehicles is endurance , simply because they can not carry suufficient power for long missions			1
however , @entity35 , who is a student at @entity4 's lab dedicated to developing small flying craft , realised that power was freely available - above the ground			1
' recent advances in xed - wing perching have made it possible to consider a new solution to this problem - landing on a powerline to recharge			1
' the system works using the power line 's magnetic field			1
four metres away from it , sensors in the plane 's nose sense it , and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire , exactly like a bird			0
as the plane approaches the wire , it raises its nose to allow it to ' perch ' on the wire with clamps where wheels would usually be			0
the @entity73 is also working on a similar system , developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms , hover like bees , crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision			1
the @entity82 , a research arm of the @entity73 , has released a computer - animated video outlining the the future capabilities of @entity86 ( @entity87 )			2
the project , announced last year , promises to revolutionize war by down - sizing the combatants			2
' @entity87 will become a vital element in the ever - changing war - fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future , ' the narrator intones			2
' @entity98 , pervasive , lethal - @entity86 , enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter			2
' one drone type soars like a pigeon and perches unobtrusively on a power line to observe a surveillance target with a camera			2
the @entity73 is working on technology that will allow the drones to steal electricity from power cables and other sources - so they can continue to operate for days or weeks on end			1
hovering : @entity86 ( @entity87 ) are the future of the unmanned drones program , according to a new video from the @entity73			0
the @entity73 has already developed a drone capable of hovering like a moth perching : the video , released by the @entity118 , shows a pigeon - like drone that can draw power from an electrical wire while its camera watches a target crawling : the drones will be equipped with legs so that they can crawl through tight spaces like an insect the project , which is based at @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity131 , was revealed in the march issue of the @entity133			1
@entity73 officials said they have already produced tiny remote - control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes			2
researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible			0
still , the @entity73 has a clear concept of what it hopes to accomplish with the program			0
the promotional video begins with a swarm of tiny drones be dropped on a city from a passing plane			0
the drones will work in concert to patch together a wide , detailed view of the battlefield - singling out individual targets without losing sight of the broader scene			0
' data will be communicated among the @entity87 to enable real time , reliable decision - making and to provide an advanced overall picture for other platforms or operators , ' the @entity73 says			0
killing : the video demonstrates how @entity87 could be used to sneak up behind unsuspecting targets and kill them with a single , lethal shot lethal : the drones could be equipped with incapacitating chemicals , combustible payloads or even explosives ' for precision targeting capability ' as the drones fall , they begin to fly - not like planes , but like insects			0
high frequency flapping wings allow the drones to hover and maneuver in tight spaces			0
the military has already produced a drone patterned after a hawk moth that can flap its wings 30 times a second			0
however , the activity exhausts the drone 's tiny battery in just a few minutes , according to @entity133 .			0

@entity4 student has already developed working prototype
could be used by the military for long - running surveillance
technique uses magnetic field to land in the perfect spot
air force developing similar craft that could hunt in swarms
