by @entity1 reporter published : 06:06 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 12:35 est , 3 march 2014 from peacock blue @entity3 spikes to towering @entity5 , the stars of @entity7 were as famous for their footwear and they were for their exploits in and out of bed			2
now , @entity11 , the actress who played conservative @entity12 , has spoken out against the cult of the high heel and has apologised to fans for encouraging them to squeeze their feet into uncomfortable shoes			1
but her confession is n't entirely out of character : with flats now the stylish shoe of choice , @entity20 seems as fashion - savvy as ever			1
' it did seem we were trying to say to women , " you should be wearing heels like these "			2
speaking in an interview with the @entity41 , @entity20 added : ' but we definitely were n’t			2
were they beautiful shoes ? yes			2
were they appropriate for the characters ? yes , that ’s what women like that wear			2
' but it became a bigger picture thing , where it seemed women should be wearing them every day			0
' although her stance might come as a shock to tv fans , flats have been steadily gaining ground on heels and are currently the stylish shoe of choice , as @entity20 , who says she only wears flats , is all too well aware			1
so fashionable are flats , @entity66 sent all of his models down the runway in trainers during january 's round of couture shows in @entity73 , while off the catwalk , stylish flats have been embraced by everyone from @entity77 and @entity78 to home secretary @entity79			1
what 's more , orthopaedic style flats such as @entity82 sandals have been deemed the hottest shoe for summer , along with the equally sturdy pool slider			1
seal of approval : @entity66 accessorised every outfit with trainers during the @entity90 couture show stylish : the @entity91 in her taupe @entity93 canvas plimsolls and favourite @entity95 skinny jeans stylish : @entity96 shows off her fashion savvy in a chic pair of buckled flat pumps other popular choices include the brogue , especially in sunny pastel shades , and the loafer			1
even the humble ballet pump and the equally low key plimsoll are enjoying a new lease of life , with the @entity91 choosing a pair of the latter to wear on the plane en route to a holiday in @entity113			0
since @entity7 ended in 2004 , @entity20 has had something of a chequered career , with roles in rom coms such as the badly - received @entity118 interspersed with stints voicing children 's cartoons and a guest appearance on @entity123			1
her latest project will see her star as @entity127 in a stage adaption of @entity129 , scheduled to begin at @entity131 's @entity130 this month			1
nevertheless , she remains best known for her @entity7 character @entity12 and her impressive wardrobe of sky high heels			0
' i wear heels so rarely now , ' she added			0
' it hurts when i do – you have to get in training for them , and it takes a lot of practice			0
' and @entity20 is n't the only former @entity7 to swear off heels			1
last year , co-star @entity145 revealed that she had been forced to give up her spikes because of damage to her feet			0
speaking to @entity151 's in - house magazine , @entity149 said : ' i went to a foot doctor and he said , " your foot does things it should n’t be able to do			0
that bone there – you ’ve created that bone			0
it does n’t belong there " ’			0
' the moral of the story is , the chickens are coming home to roost .			0
