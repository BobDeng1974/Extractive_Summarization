three more @entity1 managers have given their strong backing to @entity3 ’s @entity5 campaign			1
@entity7 ’s @entity6 , @entity8 ’ @entity9 and @entity10 of @entity11 yesterday all called for tougher action to put an end to wrestling , grabbing and shirt - pulling in the penalty area			1
they want the rules to be made clearer to officials in charge of their matches and for clubs to be given a detailed explanation of their application			1
@entity6 has called on referees ’ chief @entity25 to make it clear what sanctions will be taken against the practice ahead of this weekend ’s round of @entity1 fixtures			1
@entity6 said : ‘ it ’s very important , because there has been the @entity34 ’s campaign and a lot of media talk , a lot of talk on the radio , that @entity25 actually gives us an indication of what they ’re going to do			1
@entity7 boss @entity6 has responded to @entity3 's campaign by calling on referees to act @entity9 and @entity10 have also spoken out about illegal defending in the box this week ‘ i would hate for them to do a crackdown without a prior warning			1
they have done that in the past			1
suddenly we start getting decisions : “ oh yeah , we have made it a policy and we ’re going to change that ”			1
why not let us know then ? ‘ some managers perhaps think it is an advantage and they can get away with it			1
‘ it would be nice to know what @entity25 is going to do			2
this question is really for him and he needs to answer it			2
’ @entity6 is growing tired of inconsistent decision - making and would accept if his team were penalised for holding in the box against @entity64 tomorrow , provided the same decision is given at the other end			1
‘ those big decisions need to be made , ’ he added			1
‘ if we have a decision against us about grappling we are going to have to accept it			2
likewise if @entity64 , who are struggling at set plays , decide to use that tactic then i expect to see a penalty			2
’ @entity9 believes grappling in the box has come into the @entity77 game due to players and youngsters watching foreign football on television			1
@entity82 was clearly seen hauling @entity83 to the ground on wednesday night @entity86 , despite glaring evidence , did not give @entity7 a penalty during the first half he claims the practice did not take place back when he was a player and that children are taught from a young age to mark correctly from set pieces — so it is not down to coaching			1
@entity9 said : ‘ no - one grappled in those days , it ’s a new thing			1
it was watching foreign football			1
in @entity102 football they used to mark like that years ago			1
it did n’t happen in @entity77			2
‘ hopefully people will learn to mark correctly			2
you ca n’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner ’s being played in			2
i ’ve said it for years			2
@entity109 was guilty of pulling @entity110 down in the @entity112 penalty area on wednesday referee @entity114 , never one to shy away from controversy , did not give a penalty ‘ you do n’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone , just pull them			2
that ’s happening more and more			2
hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it			2
’ @entity10 , in charge at @entity11 , wants referees to be handed clearer rules so they can act when defenders pull back attackers at set pieces			1
‘ referees need to be more consistent but the rules can be clearer too , ’ @entity10 said			1
‘ it ’s an art to defend and to take contact away completely with everybody marking zonal would take away from the game			2
@entity136 has made a conscious effort to not pull , but was seen with his arms around @entity139 ‘ but there ’s a line you do n’t cross and it is making sure the line is clear			1
that line is when you have been beaten by the man , he ’s got away from you and you are pulling his shirt and grabbing his arms			2
that ’s what you have to stamp out			0
the refs need to be given a clear rule as it would be an easier decision for them			0
’ @entity153 boss @entity152 discourages his players from doing it in training			0
he said : ‘ if i see it in training , i give a penalty because that ’s what happens in a game ’			0
@entity162 , @entity163 captain ' me and @entity165 were double headlocked at every corner			0
' @entity167 , @entity64 assistant manager ' grappling			0
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ' interpretation and we 'll leave it to them			0
that 's what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it 's in their hands really			0
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n't have to mark anyone			0
' @entity188 , @entity189 striker ' there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			0
it was like @entity195 in the @entity7 area			0
' @entity197 , former top referee ' hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			1
' @entity205 , @entity189 defender ' defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			0
' @entity213 , @entity214 manager ' in a congested area how can you judge if someone 's been blocked ? it 's part of the game and some people are good at it			0
a local @entity224 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
' can you show me some blocking techniques ? ' that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n't be given as penalties			1
there has to be consistency			0
' @entity6 , @entity7 manager ‘ it ’s very important , because there has been the @entity34 ’s campaign and a lot of media talk , a lot of talk on the radio , that @entity25 actually gives us an indication of what they ’re going to do			1
@entity9 , @entity8 manager ‘ hopefully people will learn to mark correctly			1
you ca n’t mark looking at the opponent when the corner ’s being played in			0
i ’ve said it for years			0
you do n’t teach kids to grapple hold of someone , just pull them			0
that ’s happening more and more			0
hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it			0
’ @entity152 , @entity153 manager ‘ if i see it in training , i give a penalty because that ’s what happens in a game ’ and the readers of @entity270 ... ' it 's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it 's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			1
' @entity278 , @entity279 ' to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i 've been watching football since the @entity290 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i 've ever seen			1
' sir @entity293 , @entity295			0

@entity6 , @entity9 and @entity10 back the campaign
managers want rules to made clearer and clubs to get explanations
@entity9 blames trend on *influence* of foreign football
