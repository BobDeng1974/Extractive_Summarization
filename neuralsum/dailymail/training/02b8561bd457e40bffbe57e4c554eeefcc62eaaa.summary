by @entity0 , in @entity1 , poland languishing in filthy conditions with little food or water , puppies bred on a @entity8 farm face a long and arduous journey			1
their destination ? the @entity12 , where they will be sold at a huge profit to unsuspecting dog - lovers who have no idea where they came from			2
the cruel trade is booming after @entity12 relaxed import rules two years ago to meet @entity22 guidelines			1
since then , thousands of dogs have been brought into the country from @entity25 , many in poor health and with no vaccinations			1
@entity40 , right , offered this balding miniature pinscher for £ 200 , saying its hair would grow back in the light cheap , but not so cheerful : puppy trader @entity45 tries to sell @entity47 puppies to mail writer @entity0 the @entity48 accompanied animal welfare charity @entity49 as officials confiscated 12 dogs on a filthy small - scale farm in the @entity55 district of rural @entity8			1
two @entity57 shepherd puppies were found lying in the basement of a dark and filthy outbuilding			0
their only food was rotten pig ’s intestines , which lay stinking on the damp concrete floor			0
the breeding dogs also included cocker spaniels , with bleeding ears and matted calloused paws			0
@entity69 , @entity49 @entity12 country manager , said breeders were selling their pedigree puppies at @entity8 markets for less than £ 100 to unscrupulous dealers			1
once in @entity12 , they can fetch up to £ 850			2
‘ the puppies are often badly treated and in poor health , ’ said miss @entity74			1
‘ some are as young as four weeks old when sold , far younger than the legal limit of 15 weeks			0
‘ taken too young from their mothers , they are transported hundreds of miles to reach the @entity12			2
this is organised international crime with a network of people making a profit at every stage			0
’ breeding machine : a @entity57 bitch found lying in squalor with her days - old puppy during a raid carried out by a @entity8 animal charity on an illicit puppy farm in the @entity55 district of rural northern @entity8 captive : a young @entity57 shepherd at the farm and , right , feeling grass for the first time after her rescue sad eyes : the puppy is carried to safety in the arms of @entity69 , @entity107 , who said breeders were selling their pedigree puppies to unscrupulous dealers at @entity8 markets for under £ 100 @entity12 relaxed its pet passport scheme in 2012 , meaning pet owners no longer needed to wait six months after a rabies vaccination before entering the country			1
the change triggered a surge in the number of puppies being brought over for sale from @entity25			2
between 2011 and 2012 , imports to the @entity12 rose 1,150 per cent from @entity122 , 450 per cent from @entity123 , 507 per cent from @entity124 and 183 per cent from @entity8			1
under the rules , five puppies can be brought in per person for non-commercial purposes			0
but many dealers bring them in en masse			0
others enter with forged vaccination documents – putting @entity12 at risk of rabies			2
frightened : the mother of the @entity57 shepherd pup hides in the barn where they were kept compassion : @entity140 from animal charity @entity141 carries a puppy to safety			0
right , ms @entity69 from @entity49 @entity12 , who said the animals can fetch as much as £ 850 on the @entity12 market at a puppy market in @entity148 , central @entity8 , the @entity48 spoke to @entity37 , a burly trader with two dachshunds tucked into his jacket			1
standing next to cots , cages and cardboard boxes full of thoroughbreds , he smirked as he boasted of how easy it is to import dogs into @entity12			1
‘ we sell to the @entity12 all the time , ’ he said			2
‘ what kind of puppies do you want ? @entity162 bulldogs , chihuahuas ? it is not a problem			0
’ at the same market , a man called @entity40 was offering to sell a miniature pinscher for £ 200 , saying it was the last of his litter			0
holding the shaking ‘ handbag dog ’ , the middle - aged man said the fur on the puppy ’s head would grow back ‘ once it is in the daylight ’			0
‘ it has been living in the dark , indoors , so the hair does not grow , ’ he added			0
holding the puppy in one hand , he told the @entity48 : ‘ this is a very good price			1
my daughter lived in @entity184 and these dogs are 3,000 zloty there ( £ 600 )			0
this is much cheaper than the @entity12			2
’ caged : @entity57 stud dogs wait in their kennels to be taken away by the animal charity and rehomed stinking : buckets of putrefying pigs ' intestines used as food lay in the kennels next to the dogs a neglected spaniel before she is rescued by the animal charity			1
she would have been used for breeding			0
hope : cocker spaniels were found on the farm with bleeding ears and matted calloused paws once in @entity12 , the @entity25 dealers sell the puppies either over the internet or on to @entity12 traders who pick them up from petrol stations or car parks near the ports or motorways			1
the @entity12 dealers then sell the animals on from their own homes , pretending they are home - bred			2
according to @entity219 figures , the number of dogs which entered from @entity8 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 rose from 2,000 to 12,000 between 2011 and 2013			1
@entity220 , @entity221 mp for @entity223 ’s @entity222 and @entity224 , raised the startling statistics in @entity226 last month			0
he said : ‘ the rules regarding the importation of dogs appear to be completely useless when you look at the huge number of animals which are coming into the @entity12			1
' none of them , not a single one , was supposedly brought in for commercial purposes			0
' many people are then buying these puppies in @entity12 mistakenly , in the belief they have the appropriate paperwork , when it is either forged or incomplete			2
’ chained up : a husky that has been cruelly treated at a farm in @entity244 pictured during a raid to rescue dogs there			1
right , a man from the animal charity carries the dog away to be treated and rehomed mistreated : the poorly treated animal is blind in one eye and very thin animal charities have warned @entity12 is at risk of rabies , a disease the country has been free from since 1922			1
@entity258 , of the @entity259 , said : ‘ we have a big dog population in the @entity12 and are a nation of pet owners			1
‘ the criminal gangs have realised it is a good market and they can make quick money here			0
‘ the puppy farms we have seen in @entity123 have been horrific , with very little daylight			0
‘ they are kept as breeding machines to churn out puppies and then transported in a transit van across @entity25			2
the chances of getting caught are very low			0
’ but he warned that pet owners risk being landed with a large bill if they accidentally buy a dog with no vaccinations from a puppy farm			1
‘ a lot of these animals are suffering from terrible diseases such as parvovirus , leishmaniasis , and echinococcus , which are prevalent in these countries in @entity25 , ’ he said			2
‘ the owners are also taking a risk			0
if they take their dog to be registered with a vet and the vet finds the dog has not been micro-chipped or vaccinated then the dog will have to go into quarantine for six months and the owner will have to pay for that			0
‘ it is never worth trying to get a bargain basement puppy – for the animal or the owner			1

cruel trade booming since @entity25 forced @entity12 to relax import controls
thousands of *unvaccinated* dogs are now arriving in here in poor health
