former @entity1 midfielder @entity0 feels the club will be better off in the long term without @entity4 , a player he believes ' ca n't be trusted '			1
@entity4 was the @entity5 ' star man last season , notching 31 @entity8 goals to help them finish second in the table			2
the @entity12 forward was subsequently hit with a four - month ban from all football - related activities for biting @entity16 's @entity15 at the @entity17 - he will learn the outcome of his appeal to the @entity20 on thursday - and @entity1 sold him to @entity21 for £ 75million			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity1 defender @entity23 discuss @entity4 's absence @entity26 hero : @entity4 inspired @entity1 to a second - placed finish and @entity29 football last season fang - tastic : the @entity31 was banned for four months for biting @entity32 defender @entity15 the @entity33 have splashed their cash considerably , bringing a raft of new players in such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 from @entity40 , @entity45 from @entity42 and @entity43 from @entity44 , and @entity0 thinks good business has been done			1
the @entity47 international is optimistic about @entity1 's prospects for the new campaign and confident they will not suffer too greatly for the departure of @entity4 , whose three and a half years with the @entity53 outfit were disrupted by lengthy suspensions for another biting incident and a racial abuse case			1
@entity0 , speaking at a @entity57 's and @entity58 , told @entity59 : ' i think @entity1 have bought well			1
' i have always been very critical of @entity4 's antics			0
big money : @entity4 has moved to @entity21 for a huge £ 75million and @entity0 thinks the deal suits @entity1 ended in tears : @entity4 was the @entity8 's best player last season but could n't lead his team to the title ' in footballing terms , he is a big loss , but somebody else will score the goals and i think , long - term , they will be better off without him than with him			1
' i 'd rather have the six or seven players they have now than @entity4 , because at the end of the day , if you want to win things , you need people you can trust , and he ca n't be trusted			1
' if he does something stupid again , he could be out for years , or for good			0
' yes , he has been great , there is no doubt about it			0
but what could have been if he had not missed all the games he did when he was here ? maybe the team would have been in the @entity29 a while ago			0
better off : @entity88 ( left ) who won the @entity29 with @entity1 , thinks @entity4 is replacable ' all he has to show from his time at @entity1 is a @entity92 winner 's medal ( from 2011/12 )			1
he is not leaving a team that was ruling the @entity8 or @entity94 during that the last few years			0
' he is a player who scored goals , but at the end of the day they only got into the @entity29 with him last season			2
' @entity1 exceeded expectation with their finish last term as they comfortably secured their long - awaited return to @entity29 football and almost the @entity8 title to boot			2
@entity0 - who played for the @entity5 between 1999 and 2006 , and was part of their famous 2005 @entity29 triumph - believes they can build on those efforts this season , but is not expecting them to go one place better in the top - flight just yet			1
' i do n't think last year was a flash in the pan , ' the 40 - year - old said			0
' mentally , it could leave a scar or two because they missed a huge chance			0
but i think they can build on it			0
partnership : @entity121 has brought in half a dozen players with the money @entity4 earned the club ' playing in @entity94 and then in the league is tough , so that will be a big test they will have to pass			1
' i do n't think they are title contenders this season - i would take another top - four finish now and qualifying for the knockout stages of the @entity29			2
' that would be a good season			0
but it 's very hard to predict ! ' @entity0 joined kids at @entity137 in @entity138 to celebrate the work of @entity141 clubs at a @entity57			2
