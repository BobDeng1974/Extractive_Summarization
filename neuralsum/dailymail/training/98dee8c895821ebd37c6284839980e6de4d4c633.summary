defeat was just a few minutes old and the emotions came hustling in , wave upon wave			1
there was disillusion , despair , bewilderment and weary resignation			1
on the face of @entity11 , you could read the entire , distressful history of @entity13 at the @entity14			1
the old ones will recall those expressions flickering across the frosty features of sir @entity18 in @entity19 1970			1
in turn , the same emotions were to visit men like @entity23 , sir @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
humble pie became their staple diet , for all were ultimately confronted by the reality that the world will not buy what @entity13 has to offer			1
haunted : @entity11 is the latest @entity13 manager to have reality check the plot never changes			1
it follows a seemingly predestined course and ends not with a bang but a whimper			1
having studied the sobering process for so long , even @entity13 's travelling followers have finally modified their expectations			1
a great deal of hard currency crossed the bars of @entity46 the other evening in return for a torrent of strong lager			1
yet , thankfully , little damage was done to people or property			1
for disappointment was muted , the history lessons had been slowly digested			1
yet still , in those first , vulnerable moments , @entity11 seemed devastated			1
for he had worked unsparingly at his task			1
preparations had been expensively perfect , the camp was happy and hopeful and raw promise seemed to be delivering heartening performance			1
after so much concentrated effort , the manager had allowed himself to believe the words of that terrible old @entity14 song : ' this time , we 'll get it right			2
' and they did n't			2
as @entity69 , @entity24 and the rest could testify , they never do			1
this time , in fact , the errors arrived in clusters and the culprits formed a long , disorderly queue			1
@entity76 performed like a @entity76 tribute act , enduring a nightmare of hapless imprecision			1
@entity80 was similarly culpable , while charity insists that we do not mention the defensive efforts of @entity84			2
all this and @entity85 turning in the kind of display which confirmed the growing reservations about his general competence			2
as a former @entity91 manager confided after the match : ' the truth is , @entity13 do n't have a defence			2
' forward planning : @entity11 is expected to stay on as @entity13 boss one bizarrely popular response was to blame the absence of @entity98			1
all would have been well , it seems , had we pleaded with the man who was properly stripped of the @entity13 captaincy for the vile abuse he screeched at @entity104 and who later rejected international football			2
you may recall the almighty chasing he received in @entity109 at the last @entity14 finals on the day that @entity111 put four past @entity13			2
the notion of a return to @entity98 is both frivolous and demeaning			1
then there is the matter of the manager			2
once again , knees jerk and sanity is suspended			2
' sack him ! ' screams the pack			2
' he 's got to go ' , bawl the hunt followers			2
while a prominent bookies ' runner , shamelessly inciting mug punters , offered 9 - 4 that @entity11 is no longer manager of @entity13 come september : ' it would appear that tactics , team selection and motivation are things potentially lacking in @entity11 's armoury , ' drivelled the impertinent huckster			1
already , the pursuit carries the whiff of the lynch mob			2
now clearly , @entity11 has made errors			1
the omission of @entity136 was a decision he will surely regret			2
@entity136 may no longer be the surging athlete of old but he would have proved a more effective defender than the struggling @entity80			2
and the selection of @entity140 remains difficult to comprehend			0
@entity140 has yet to kick a ball in this @entity14			0
if he is again ignored for tuesday 's irrelevant scuffle with @entity144 , then the public may deserve an explanation for his presence in the squad			0
and if @entity13 's young pretenders really did freeze for the crucial match with @entity151 - having bloomed so bravely against @entity152 - then we are entitled to ask how it happened and why it was not foreseen			0
but @entity11 is a football manager ; he is not an alchemist			1
@entity13 's performances are governed by the number and quality of the players at his disposal			0
it is scarcely the manager 's fault that the numbers are so small and the quality so tepid that he is forced to send out @entity84 and @entity164 as the country 's unchallenged central defensive alliance			1
sacking the manager would represent a failure of the imagination , a placatory bone tossed to the chasing hounds			0
on the ball : @entity11 has to learn from the mistakes he made at @entity14 yet there were fears that the @entity177 chairman @entity176 might stoop to a populist gesture			1
after all , his last notable gesture - that embarrassing throat - slitting charade at the @entity14 draw - proved a remarkably accurate prophecy			0
fortunately , @entity176 has recognised the futility of abandoning @entity11 at this stage and has announced his support of the manager through to 2016			1
his next step , of course , should involve an outright confrontation with the @entity91 , who were created with the boldly declared and palpably fraudulent aim of improving the national side			0
already , @entity176 has asked the central question : ' if your top league is largely foreign - owned with foreign managers , why should those in control care about developing the @entity13 team ? ' but his subsequent attempts to address the problem have been incoherent and unconvincing			0
quite possibly he is hopelessly handicapped by his past			0
as a prominent television executive in the early @entity204 , @entity176 played a crucial role in the @entity91 's formation			0
the consequence of his pioneering efforts could be seen in the @entity209 , @entity46 , on thursday evening			0
at such times , @entity211 football treads a well - worn path			0
after the initial shock and the subsequent eruption of public anger , those charged with running the game wring their hands , shake their heads and solemnly promise that this affront to our national dignity must never be allowed to happen again			0
then the new season arrives , fresh millions are expended on new foreign recruits and we return to our usual orgy of @entity230			0
and the nation forgets how it felt to be humiliated with the whole world watching and sniggering			0
one man at least will never forget			0
the merest glance at that crumpled face told us how savagely he was suffering			0
@entity11 had entertained high hopes that he might break the mould at this @entity14 , that he might achieve something quite dramatic with his young , striving , adventurous players			1
but old habits die hard			0
success is reserved for better , more deserving football teams			0
and within the space of two unhappy matches , @entity11 has joined the ranks of @entity69 , @entity24 , @entity25 and the rest			1
all gifted men , all fine football managers			0
and all victims of the @entity211 disease			0
@entity252 as @entity211 football takes its early bath , the search for scapegoats begins in earnest			0
the suspects so far include the manager , the coaches , the media , the defence , the strikers , the pitches and the weather			0
and yet , the most culpable candidate by far has slipped clean away			0
he is an orthopaedic surgeon at the @entity268 hospital in @entity269			0
on may 22 , this gentleman was required to repair part of a meniscus cartilage in the knee of a celebrated athlete			0
he did his job with such disobliging brilliance that his patient ( pictured above ) felt able to play international football precisely four weeks later			0
and the rest , as they say â€¦			0

@entity69 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and now @entity11 have been forced to eat humble pie
there were many culprits , @entity76 performed like a @entity76 tribute act
one bizarrely popular response was to blame the absence of @entity98
