by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:17 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 21:08 est , 10 july 2013 footballer @entity2 has avoided completing a 250 - hour community service order by paying a £ 3,000 fine – the equivalent of half an hour of his wages			1
the multi-millionaire ’s lawyers argued that he could not complete the work after transferring from @entity12 club @entity11 to @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity2 had completed just 28 hours of his punishment – imposed after being convicted of a string of driving offences earlier this year			2
avoided : former @entity11 striker @entity2 has had his community service rescinded in favour of a £ 3,000 fine - a sum he earns in just 37 minutes on his £ 196,000 a week salary yesterday a district judge sitting at @entity25 magistrates ’ court fined @entity2 a derisory £ 3,000 – in place of finishing his punishment			1
the fine is a drop in the ocean for the @entity31 striker , who reportedly earned £ 250,000 a week at @entity11			1
based on a 40 - hour week , he collected £ 6,250 an hour – meaning the fine is the equivalent of just 30 minutes ’ ‘ work ’			1
last night criminologist dr @entity35 said : ‘ the punishment he is receiving is certainly not proportionate to his crimes			0
‘ and this certainly does not send the right message as the fine is just a tiny fraction of what he earns			1
‘ this judge has simply failed in her duty to the justice system			0
’ a spokesman for @entity48 added : ‘ let ’s not beat about the bush , @entity2 was guilty of repeated driving offences and rode roughshod over the @entity53 justice system			0
into @entity14 : the @entity31 signed for @entity13 two weeks ago			2
his career at @entity11 was tempestuous ‘ by flouting a driving ban and then essentially escaping justice with a measly fine the courts have shown themselves to be complete pushovers			1
‘ the level of the fine is a disgrace and sends out completely the wrong message to other drivers			2
‘ maybe the next offender will seek to have his community order lifted and offer a fraction of his weekly wage			0
’ @entity2 , 29 , was not in court			0
his lawyers were told he would face the £ 5,000 maximum fine for his offence – but with a £ 2,000 ‘ reduction ’ for his guilty plea and the 28 hours ’ work he completed			1
@entity2 leaving @entity76 in april after he was ordered to carry out 250 hours of community service @entity2 was disqualified from driving for six months and handed community service in april after he admitted driving while disqualified and without insurance			1
the court heard he had completed 28 hours of the order at @entity25 ’s @entity82 , where he helped adults with learning difficulties			2
@entity85 , defending , said the order became unworkable when the player was sold to a foreign club , adding : ‘ events overtook his control and he was sold to @entity13			0
’ a community service order involves unpaid work in the community or attendance at a centre to undertake a course , such as anger management			1
breaches can see the orders being revoked and more severe penalties imposed			0
yesterday judge @entity100 accepted the circumstances were beyond @entity2 ’s control , adding : ‘ this is only a technical breach			0
it is not , i repeat not , a case of a footballer thumbing his nose at a court order			0
’ it is thought @entity2 ’s legal team argued that because he was sold by @entity11 , he was not responsible in law for his inability to comply with the order			2
in a statement , @entity2 said : ‘ i would like to thank the court for its understanding			0

the former @entity11 striker was given 250 hours unpaid work in april
he will now pay a fine instead so he can transfer to @entity14 league
on £ 196,000 a week , the fine is less than what he earns in under 40 minutes
