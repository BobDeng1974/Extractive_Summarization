@entity1 captain @entity0 recovered from being hit on the helmet by the first ball he faced to underpin @entity1 's decent response to @entity6 's strong first - innings total in @entity7			1
@entity0 's impressive 184 - ball innings of 115 on day three propelled the tourists to 369 for five at stumps after @entity6 declared on 517 for seven before the start of play			1
there was a heart - in - mouth moment when he first arrived at the crease though , with @entity17 's short - pitched delivery hitting him full - on in the helmet			2
@entity1 captain @entity0 celebrates as he reaches his century on day three of the first test in @entity7 @entity0 is hit on the helmet by the first ball he faced from @entity20 paceman @entity17 @entity17 reacted immediately to check on the @entity23 skipper 's welfare , as did several @entity20 players @entity17 ( right ) is offered words of encouragement by @entity20 captain @entity27 after the hit with much of @entity6 still coming to terms with the death of @entity32 from similar circumstances , there was genuine concern as the hosts surrounded the @entity23 skipper to check he was not hurt , while captain @entity27 comforted @entity17			1
but @entity0 was fine and ensured his side have a fighting chance going into day four by building key partnerships of 81 , 101 and 74 with @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 respectively			2
with the sun shining once more after wednesday 's interruptions , @entity6 declared their innings before the start of play			2
in the third over of the day , @entity50 , on one , survived a dropped chance when he got an inside edge off @entity17 , although it was a tough one as @entity53 dived for the ball only to see it slip through his grasp			0
@entity0 hits a shot on his way to a rousing century for @entity1 at the @entity59 @entity20 @entity60 takes a catch to dismiss @entity1 captain @entity0 late in the day @entity17 ( left ) celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity0 ( right ) on day three of the test @entity50 stuck around to help @entity1 score at a decent rate , but was nevertheless the first man out for 25 , another inside edge off @entity60 needing no further assistance this time as it went straight on to his stumps			1
@entity70 had made a tentative start at the other end , but after taking eight off a loose over from @entity73 , he began to open up , and he ended the 20th over with a six and a four off consecutive balls from @entity76			0
he would hit @entity77 for six again but soon after reaching his half - century he fell victim to @entity17 , playing at a delivery which swung away from him and helping it into the gloves of @entity53 to go for 53			0
that brought @entity0 to the middle and before he could set about a fine afternoon 's work there was the tense moment of @entity17 's delivery hitting his helmet as he ducked late			1
once @entity0 was given chance to settle , he and @entity41 got to work before @entity77 broke their third - wicket stand with a good delivery which caused @entity41 to hesitate before a tentative prod merely helped it through on to the stumps			0
a general view shows the number 408 that was painted on the ground as a tribute to @entity32 @entity101 ( left ) dives for the ball after @entity1 's @entity41 plays a stroke a view of the @entity59 as @entity1 supporters wave their flags after a boundary was hit cricket fans sit in front of the scoreboard at the @entity59 as they watch the action on day three @entity77 continued to put @entity1 under pressure , in particular asking lots of questions of the new man in @entity42 , who was subject to one big shout for lbw - replays showed an inside edge - and then offered a half - chance to short leg , with the ball just falling short			1
from the first ball after tea , @entity0 brought up his first test fifty in 11 innings , a great way to show how he is handling the extra responsibility of captaining the side for the first time			2
at the other end , @entity42 was nearing a half - century of his own , but still offering chances			0
a big pull shot from a @entity73 bouncer went high but @entity77 , racing in from the boundary , could not stretch for the catch and instead it ran for four			0
@entity42 would make it past 50 , but with the new ball looming , @entity76 stepped up his attack			0
@entity6 claimed the catch when @entity139 twisted acrobatically at short leg , but the ball had come off the pad			0
but from the next delivery , @entity42 gloved it to the slips where @entity146 hung on to remove him for 62			0
with @entity43 in at the other end , @entity0 brought up his century in style by punishing @entity150 's poor delivery to claim his 12th and final four of the day over the mid-wicket boundary			2
they kept @entity1 ticking over before @entity17 made the key breakthrough for the hosts in the 95th over , taking @entity0 's wicket with a bouncer that the @entity1 captain could only send into the palms of @entity60 at deep fine leg			1
stumps came two overs later with @entity43 , unbeaten on 33 , and @entity162 , one not out , at the crease with @entity1 trailing by 148 runs .			1
