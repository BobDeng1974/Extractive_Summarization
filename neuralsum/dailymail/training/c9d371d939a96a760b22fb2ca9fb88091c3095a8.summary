the @entity1 is set to be a sell - out - but people should still expect to see some gaps in seating , officials said today			0
organisers revealed that around 2.3m tickets have been sold , 200,000 short of their target			1
but chief executive @entity9 said they expect to hit their ticket goal , with half the remaining seats on sale before @entity14 - time			1
the organisers are ' delighted ' with the interest in the @entity1			0
@entity14 organisers will be hoping to avoid a repeat of some @entity18 days where there were swathes of empty seats not sold out : many empty seats were spotted at @entity18 swimming events , but officials say they are 200,000 tickets away from a complete sell - out @entity1 chairman @entity27 predicted that many people watching these events for the first - time will be ' blown away '			1
many of the day pass tickets have been created to allow people to take in different sports as many of them will be new spectators of @entity14 events			1
mr @entity9 said : ' if you take the venues like @entity38 where effectively you have got a mixture of people in that venue and about a quarter of seats will be general admission for people who want to watch that sport - then there will be about three - quarter of the seats that will be for people who are rotating through on a day pass			2
@entity9 , chief executive of @entity52 , said organisers were on course for a sold - out @entity1 ' the whole point is to give people a chance to sample different sports so you will see a churn through the biggest chunk of most of those venues			1
you will see some empty seats there as people move through them and try different sports			2
' figuring out the availability of tickets , which is affected by issues such as seating and camera positions , organisers ' really are down to the last two or three per cent of tickets in each venue , ' according to mr @entity9			2
he said : ' we really only want to make sure that we only sell a ticket where a seat actually exists and you have a good view			0
' the take - up and resale of some tickets which go to the athletes ’ friends and families depends on who qualifies for the later rounds of the competitions			0
members of the public should expect to see some empty accredited seats at the @entity1 , an issue that frustrated many spectators who could not get a ticket for the @entity18			0
he said : ' there are fewer accredited seats at the @entity14 than there were for the @entity18 but it is still the same basic situation where we set aside banks of seats for athletes to watch their fellow athletes , for broadcasters , written press , officials and representatives from the sports federations			1
' to the extent our experience of how they churn through those seats tells us that if it is possible to sell some more we will put those on the market just as we did at the @entity18			0
' he imagines it will ' probably be slightly fewer ' tickets available than came up during the @entity18 as the organisers now have more experience of managing the seating arrangements			2
@entity122 , @entity123 and @entity27 look on as @entity124 , who became the first person to complete a marathon in a bionic suit , lights the @entity14 cauldron in @entity129 this morning changes : the @entity131 in @entity132 has undergone a @entity14 makeover ahead of the @entity14 ready for the next show : the giant @entity18 rings in cities across the @entity137 have started coming down and many are being replaced with the ' agitos ' he said : ' our very detailed understanding of where you have a restricted view or have n’t and where you can move the barriers between accredited and non-accredited areas is really very well refined now			1
' i think the way we can manage the bowl at the @entity1 is much more rifle shot because of the experience we had at the @entity18			0
' the ticket sales budget for the @entity1 is more than £ 25 million in comparison to the @entity18 of half a billion .			0

2.3m tickets sold for games , 200,000 short of overall target
but organisers *insist* remaining seats will be sold
lord @entity27 says people watching @entity14 events for first time will be ' blown away '
