and around half escape any kind of custodial sentence if young offenders ’ institutions are included in the equation			0
only 1 in 10 gets a sentence of more than 5 years - and no driver convicted for a death has ever received the maximum sentence of 14 years			1
the analysis of official @entity27 figures is revealed today by @entity29 mp @entity5 as he launches an online campaign demanding killer drivers receive tougher penalties			1
the mp said lenient sentencing highlighted ‘ a failure of the justice system ’ which was n’t working			1
he said the will of @entity36 was being ignored by the courts because the sentencing guidelines are too weak : ‘ in 2004 @entity36 increased the maximum sentence from 10 years to 14 years reflected the seriousness of the offence , but sentences do not reflect this			1
’ he said the @entity27 figures showed that in 2011 some 408 people found guilty of causing death by careless or dangerous driving			1
some 211 went to prison of whom only 37 went to prison for more than 5 years			1
when those sent to young offender ’s institutes are excluded , the mp calculates that more than 150 escape prison – or more than a third of the total			2
the mp ’s new website at @entity58 goes live today with a campaign video			2
it features the family of 22 - year - old student @entity62 from @entity63 , @entity6 , who was killed on a pedestrian crossing in the town in february last year by a dangerous driver who ran a red light at nearly twice the speed limit			1
perfect family : ( left to right ) @entity71 , brother @entity62 , their mother @entity72 and stepfather @entity74 were ' the perfect family '			0
@entity62 was killed when crossing a pedestrian crossing in february 2011 the graduate of @entity78 in @entity79 had been accepted for a postgraduate course at @entity81 just the day before he was killed instantly on a pedestrian crossing by a driver who went through the red light at 58mph – nearly twice the 30mph speed limit – in his powerful @entity86			2
@entity62 's body was thrown more than 40 yards from the impact			0
prosecutors said the son of a hard - working and close - knit family had left home at 4pm to walk into the town centre to withdraw £ 20 from a cash machine			0
the driver @entity95 , 40 , of @entity96 drove near @entity63 , who had previous convictions for speeding and burglary , showed no emotion as he was jailed this april for just 43 months after admitting causing death by dangerous driving in the horrific crash			1
but with good behaviour he could be out within two years , fear the victim ’s family			2
the court heard @entity95 had been 82 metres from the crossing when the lights turned amber but had not braked until after hitting his victim			0
judge @entity111 said it was ‘ a tragic case ’ which had also ‘ shattered ’ the lives of @entity62 ’s family			0
killer driver : @entity95 , 40 , who had previous convictions for speeding and burglary , showed no emotion as he was jailed for just 43 months conservative mp mr @entity5 said last night : ‘ the driver has shown no remorse since , which has been particularly painful for the family			1
' the sentence means he is likely to be out of prison in less than two years			2
' @entity62 ’s family say they received a life sentence			0
' mr @entity5 said : ‘ bereaved families are right when they say lenient sentences for @entity128 are a failure of the @entity130			1
‘ @entity36 increased the maximum sentence from 10 to 14 years in 2004 , reflecting the seriousness of the offence			1
' however , this has never been used , and one in three of those convicted escape jail altogether			2
‘ the fact tough penalties are not being used shows that the will of @entity36 is being ignored			1
' judges say they are constrained by guidelines which prevent them from handing out longer sentences			0
‘ that ’s why i ’ve launched this campaign at @entity58 to call for a change in this guidance			0
’ mr @entity5 added : ‘ last year 150 drivers who killed did not go to prison at all			1
only 37 received more than five years			1
‘ no sentence can ever bring back a loved one			0
' however , we can make sure that dangerous drivers who kill receive the tough penalties they deserve			2
’ ' @entity62 ’s mother @entity72 , sister @entity71 and stepfather @entity153 say their lives have been ‘ torn apart ’ since he was mown down			0
@entity156 says on the featured video : ‘ knowing that this guy with good behaviour could be let out and joining his family in two years does n’t seem like justice			2
' for us , losing @entity62 is like a life sentence			0
’ @entity62 ’s sister @entity71 , 20 , a veterinary nurse said : ’ it is n’t fair			0
' he needs to go down for longer than that			0
' people like our family are left heartbroken every day because people get too short a sentence			0
the family have also set up their own ‘ @entity62 ’ website			0
@entity174 , deputy chief executive , @entity175 , the road safety charity , said : ‘ this campaign is crucial because letting off drivers who kill with lenient sentences , or sometimes no jail term at all , implies that driving dangerously , even when it results in loss of life and terrible suffering , is only a minor transgression			1
' these crimes must be treated more seriously with fitting punishments handed out			0
