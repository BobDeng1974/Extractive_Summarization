@entity0 could make a return to the @entity2 as early as next month to front the @entity4 live world tour , which is set to make more than £ 10million			1
@entity2 bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour , which was planned to be fronted by @entity0 along with co-presenters @entity8 and @entity10 under the @entity2 @entity4 brand			1
however the future of the shows , which have sold 200,000 tickets , has been cast into doubt after @entity0 was dismissed from the @entity2 last week for an ' unprovoked ' attack on a @entity4 producer			1
fans have paid between £ 35 and £ 200 for tickets to the live shows			2
one option could be to allow the events , which will also take place in @entity35 and @entity36 , to go ahead under a different name and without some of the key elements of the lucrative @entity2 show - such as the @entity41			0
a message on the @entity4 live tour website thanks fans for their ' continued patience '			2
it says : ' we have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of @entity0 's contract not being renewed by the @entity2			1
' @entity51 , which has been promoting the tour , said it would go ahead in some form but they may have to rebrand			0
@entity55 said : ' the @entity2 owns the name and certain aspects of the show			0
we won ; t be able to use any @entity60 of @entity4			0
@entity0 , 54 , was dismissed from the @entity2 last month for an unprovoked attack on a @entity4 producer ' there will be a new name and no @entity41 because obviously that 's their property			1
we 've sold an awful lot of tickets and we want to keep faith with people who bought the tickets			0
' sources have claimed there is a small chance the show could go ahead unchanged , but most believe it will have to be significantly changed			0
it could be renamed @entity0 , may and @entity78 or @entity79 , the @entity80 reported			0
@entity0 is already set to return to the @entity2 on april 24 when he appears as a host on have i got news for you			2
@entity85 , which makes the show , said there is no reason to believe the show will not go ahead as planned			0
if the live shows go ahead key elements may have to be removed - such as the mysterious @entity41 @entity92 , the director - general of the @entity2 , has had to employ round - the - clock bodyguards after he received a death threat for refusing to reinstate @entity0			1
he became a target after taking the final decision to axe @entity0 , the @entity2 's biggest star , from his £ 1 million - a - year role presenting the @entity99 's biggest global money - spinner			1
@entity0 's contract was not renewed after an internal investigation found that he had punched producer @entity102 in a 30 - second physical assault , following a prolonged verbal tirade in a row over a hot meal			2
the 54 - year - old 's fellow presenters , @entity10 and @entity8 , are said to be considering offers by the @entity2 to star in the corporation 's planned version of @entity4 , scheduled for 2016			2
a spokesman from @entity113 said : ' there ’s lots of speculation about @entity4 at the moment – however no @entity4 live shows have been cancelled and we are working through the implications of @entity0 ’s contract not being renewed			1
we will update ticket holders as soon as possible			0

@entity0 was due to present @entity4 live on its £ 10m world tour
tour is under @entity2 brand and the presenter was dismissed last week
talks are underway about the future of live shows and @entity0 's role
may go ahead without @entity2 branding to avoid paying £ 10million in refunds
