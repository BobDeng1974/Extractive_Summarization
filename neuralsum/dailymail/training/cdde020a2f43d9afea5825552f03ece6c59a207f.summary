popular : @entity20 's winning ways in the kitchen have made him the favourite to triumph in tomorrow 's final sales have even remained buoyant in the face of the controversies that have dogged this year 's @entity27 , including accusations of smut and the infamous ' @entity31 ' incident			1
' it ’s always great to see a tv programme inspiring shoppers to don their aprons and get cooking , and this effect is no more apparent than with the @entity38 , ' said a spokesman for @entity15			2
' now in its fifth series , the programme ’s effect on sales shows no signs of abating with this year ’s challenges prompting customers to create all manner of baked treats			0
' but it 's not only the supermarkets who are seeing the benefits as a result of @entity38 's popularity			2
bookmakers too are doing a roaring trade as punters rush to place bets on their favourite finalist , with builder @entity20 currently leading the field according to @entity62			1
popular : sales of edible glitter , pink and white sugar stars and mini marshmallows have all soared tasty : according to @entity15 , sales of baklava have shot up by an impressive 100 per cent in a week delighted : judges @entity71 and @entity72 were delighted with @entity20 's heart - shaped doughnuts last week saw @entity20 leave judges @entity71 and @entity72 delighted , as he presented a series of perfect teatime treats , including heart - shaped doughnuts and a @entity80 tea ring			1
but not far behind him is @entity82 's @entity81 with odds of 2/1 , while the last finalist , @entity84 , is hot on their heels on 3/1			1
' it will be the biggest upset since @entity88 beat @entity89 if @entity5 is n't crowned as @entity27 winner , ' said @entity62 ' @entity91			0
' he 's had @entity72 and @entity71 eating out of his hands every week and we can not see success for @entity6 or @entity7			0
' she added : ' all three of this year 's finalists are loved by @entity98 off fans which has no doubt helped ratings rocket , along with the smutty innuendos			0
' despite the smut , @entity20 , the indisputable star of this series , has proved considerably less controversial than last year 's favourite @entity106 , who set @entity108 ablaze as the final approached			2
viewer 's choice : @entity20 's smiley demeanour and baking brilliance have put him in pole position in the running : @entity84 and @entity81 will have to beat @entity20 to win the @entity27 title controversial : although @entity118 ( right ) won last year 's final , @entity117 ( left ) proved controversial although she lost the final , she has since gone on to create a recipe book of her own which has also proved controversial , thanks to pops at @entity123 and @entity124			1
