sending dozens of messages or playing games for hours can cause your phone to overheat , which can drain battery and even damage the device			2
now an @entity9 team of developers has built a ' thermal protection ' case that not only warns you when your phone is getting too hot , it will automatically cool it down			1
called @entity14 , the case uses micro-fans to blow heat away from the device , or can heat a phone using resistance coils if it gets too cold			1
sensors in the case monitor the phone 's temperature and if it gets too hot , @entity23 will cool the device using two built - in micro-fans			1
and if it gets too hot , @entity23 engages its anti-freeze protection mode to gently heat the phone using resistance coils the recommended storage temperature for most batteries is 15 ° c ( 59 ° f ) , while the ' extreme allowable ' temperature is 40 ° @entity36 ( 40 ° c to 122 ° f )			1
studies have found that a phone is most efficient when it 's between 0 ° and 35 ° c ( 32 ° f to 95 ° f ) , and keeping it as near room temperature as possible ( 22 ° @entity40 ) is ideal			2
at an average temperature of 0 ° @entity45 ) , a lithium - ion battery will lose six per cent of its maximum capacity every year			0
at 25 ° @entity39 ) degrees that number jumps to 20 per cent			0
@entity23 syncs with a smartphone over @entity49 and constantly analyses the phone 's temperature when @entity52 mode is enabled , using built - in temperature and humidity sensors			1

the board and fans are pictured auto mode can be disabled and users can also manually track temperature changes using an app. this app shows changes over time , but also reveals which apps in particular are having the highest thermal effect on the phone			2
users can then set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds inside the 0.19 - inch ( 5mm ) thick case is a pair of ' virtually silent ' , 0.07inch ( 2mm ) micro-fans with air flow of 1.3 litres per minute			1
these dissipate the heat and cool the phone down			2
@entity14 is also fitted with an ultra-thin heating coils attached to the back of a conductive copper plate			0
when @entity23 notices a drop in temperature , anti-freeze mode will engage these coils to stop the phone from freezing , even in sub-freezing conditions			1
@entity23 's sensors are pictured			1
when @entity23 's air vents are blocked , for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag , it will alert the user to warn them the temperature in their phone needs to be corrected			1
alternatively , the phone can use @entity23 's built - in battery as a backup @entity23 is fitted with temperature sensors , resistance coils and two 2mm micro-fans			1
it syncs with a smartphone over @entity49 and constantly analyses the phone 's temperature when in @entity52 mode			1
if it gets too hot , @entity23 will cool the device using the micro-fans			1
these fans help the phone dissipate heat faster and cools down the device			2
and if the phone gets too hot , @entity23 engages its anti-freeze protection to gently heat the phone using the resistance coils			1
@entity23 remains in low - power , ' sleeping mode ' the rest of the time to conserve battery			2
auto mode can be switched off at any time , though , and people can manually analyse their phone 's temperature , as well as see which apps impacting the device			1
@entity126 , when @entity23 's air vents are blocked , for example when the phone is in a pocket or bag , it alerts the user to warn them the temperature of their phone needs to be corrected			1
alternatively , the phone can use @entity23 's built - in battery as a backup			1
@entity14 is launching an @entity139 campaign to fund production of the case ( pictured ) on 9 april			2
@entity23 will be available for pre-order for @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 & @entity148 phones			0
prices have n't been announced studies have found that a phone is most efficient between 0 ° and 35 ° c ( 32 ° f to 95 ° f ) , and keeping it as near room temperature as possible ( 22 ° @entity40 ) is ideal			2
at an average temperature of 0 ° @entity45 ) , a lithium - ion battery will lose 6 % of its maximum capacity every year			0
at 25 ° @entity39 ) degrees that number jumps to 20 %			0
batteries exposed to hot temperatures lose their ability to store energy and the hotter the temperature , the faster they lose this ability			0
extreme heatcan also cause permanent battery failure if exposed for long periods			0
in the cold , when the temperatures drop low enough , the phone could think its battery is empty even if it ’s fully charged			0
the colder it gets , the least amount of energy that the battery can provide			0
in addition , the internal resistance of the battery grows , causing the output voltage to drop			0
when auto mode is enabled , these subtle temperature changes are tracked automatically , but this mode can be disabled and users can manually track these changes using the @entity23 app. this app shows temperature changes over time , but also reveals which apps are having the highest thermal effect on the phone			1
users can then set custom operation modes based on their activity and location , set their own custom temperatures zones and set alarm thresholds			0
' @entity196 is the worst enemy of your smartphone battery , ' said @entity200			0
' like all electronics , constant exposure to the elements will have a negative impact on your smartphone			0
' intense usage will lead to overheating , while extreme cold weather will lead to some circuits freezing inside your smartphone			0
' in time , these can affect the performance of your phone ’s cpu , battery and @entity217			0
and , eventually , they ’ll let you down completely			0
' ' @entity23 is the world ’s first thermal protection case designed to keep your smartphone working at its best , no matter where you go or how excessive you use it			2
' @entity14 is launching an @entity139 campaign to fund production of the case on the 9 april			2
optimal cases will then be available for pre-order for @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 & @entity148 phones			0

sensors in the @entity23 case track subtle changes in a phone 's temperature
micro-fans inside the case cool the phone down if it gets too hot
while built - in resistance coils gently heat the device if it gets too cold
case is launching on @entity139 this week , but prices have n't been revealed
