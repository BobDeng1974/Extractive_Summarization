the mother of @entity1 has hit back at the @entity3 's criticism of her daughter 's decision to end her life early rather than suffer with terminal brain cancer			1
just days after @entity10 's death last month , the @entity3 's top bioethics official called her choice ' reprehensible ' and said physician - assisted suicide should be condemned and said it was ' reprehensible			1
' but now @entity10 's mother , @entity13 , issued a sharp written response tuesday , saying the @entity3 official 's comments came as the family was grieving and were ' more than a slap in the face			1
she also cricitizes the choice of words used to describe her daughter in the statement : ' my twenty - nine - year - old daughter 's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation			1
' @entity54 is a harsh word			2
it means : ' very bad ; deserving very strong criticism			2
' @entity54 is a word i 've used as a teacher to describe the actions of @entity62 , other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles			2
' tearful : @entity1 wept in a video days before she passed away in @entity69 , @entity70 , surrounded by her family @entity10 's mother , @entity13 , pictured with her daughter i am @entity1 's mother			1
i am writing in response to a variety of comments made in the press and online by individuals and institutions that have tried to impose their personal belief system on what @entity1 and our family feel is a human rights issue			1
the imposition of ' belief ' on a human rights issue is wrong			2
to censure a personal choice as reprehensible because it does not comply with someone else 's belief is immoral			1
my twenty - nine - year - old daughter 's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation			1
reprehensible is a harsh word			2
it means : ' very bad ; deserving very strong criticism			2
' @entity54 is a word i 've used as a teacher to describe the actions of @entity62 , other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles			2
as @entity1 's mother , i find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions			1
she worked at making the world a better place to live			2
this word was used publicly at a time when my family was tender and freshly wounded			1
such strong public criticism from people we do not know , have never met – is more than a slap in the face			2
it is like kicking us as we struggle to draw a breath			0
people and institutions that feel they have the right to judge @entity1 's choices may wound me and cause me unspeakable pain but they do not deter me from supporting my daughter 's choice			1
there is currently a great deal of confusion and arrogance standing in the way of @entity143 going gently into the good night			0
i urge @entity143 to think for themselves			0
make your wishes clear while you are competent			0
make sure that you have all the options spelled out for you if you are diagnosed with an incurable , debilitating , painful disease			0
ask your family to research and face the harsh reality with you			1
ask your doctor to be brutally honest with you			0
then make your personal choice about how you will proceed			0
the ' culture of cure ' has led to a fairy tale belief that doctors can always fix our problems			0
we have lost sight of reality			0
death is not necessarily the enemy in all cases			2
sometimes a gentle passing is a gift			0
misguided doctors caught up in an aspirational belief that they must extend life , whatever the cost , cause individuals and families unnecessary suffering			0
@entity1 stood up to bullies			1
she never thought anyone else had the right to tell her how long she should suffer			0
the right to die for the terminally ill is a human rights issue			0
@entity13 @entity1 's @entity183 ' as @entity1 's mother , i find it difficult to believe that anyone who knew her would ever select this word to describe her actions			1
