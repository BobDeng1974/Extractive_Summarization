guts , veins , brains and hearts have been revealed in gruesome detail using next - generation body scanners			1
the @entity7 scanners , used by doctors in @entity9 , are currently involved in their first clinical trial aimed at making the process of medical scanning cheaper and easier			1
dubbed ' @entity14 ' , they beam x-rays through a patient 's body from which a computer can reconstruct a high - definition image , slice by slice			1
the images and @entity30 show the insides of a group of patients at @entity34 in south @entity9 , which is the first ever hospital to use the scanner			2
the technique is known as x-ray computer tomography and is often used in hospitals to look for tumours , bone fractures and bleeding			0

the images and @entity30 show the insides of a group of patients at @entity34 in south @entity9 the screw here can be clearly seen in a patient 's foot			1
dubbed ' @entity14 ' , they beam x-rays through a patient 's body from which a computer can reconstruct a high - definition image , slice by slice pictured are high - definition images of the skull and the @entity67 , which supplies blood to the brain the scanners beam x-rays through a patient 's body from which a computer can reconstruct a high - definition image , slice by slice			1
@entity7 claims that the scanner can build an image of a complete heart in just a single heartbeat			1
this is because it uses high - resolution and motion correcting technology similar to the image stabilisation features in personal cameras			2
because it can scan faster , it can scan far more accurately , capturing clear images of moving organs			0
while they are safe for patients who have pacemakers or metal inside their body , they require them to stay very still while the imaging is taking place			0
but @entity7 's scanners are different			1
the revolution uses high - resolution and motion correcting technology similar to the image stabilisation features in personal cameras			2
because they can scan faster , they can scan far more accurately , capturing clear images of moving organs			0
the team at @entity34 recently completed the world 's first six - month clinical trial of the @entity14 machine			1
local doctors said they were able to diagnose even the most challenging cardiac patients with erratic or high heartbeats and reduce the radiation dose for paediatric patients			0
' according to our physicians , patient feedback about their experience with the @entity14 has been uniformly positive , ' said @entity34 ceo @entity119			2
' the advanced design definitely makes for a less intimidating , more comfortable patient experience , while yielding amazingly accurate and detailed images			2

local doctors said they were able to diagnose even the most challenging cardiac patients with erratic or high heartbeats using the new technique another view of the @entity67			0
it is located at the base of the brain and forms a circle of arteries around it the pelvis and the aorta are seen here in spectacular detail			0
because the technologycan scan faster , it can scan far more accurately , capturing clear images of moving organs			0
the @entity24 - based healthcare group claims that the scanner can build an image of a complete heart in just a single heartbeat the rib cage , the heart and the chest cavity			1

pictured are two different view s of the rib cage			0

next - generation @entity7 scanners are being used by doctors in @entity9
they hope to make medical scanning cheaper , easier and more accurate
