by @entity0 plea : @entity1 , the care services minister , has written to @entity2 to demand assurances that gps are not making referrals for gay conversion therapy @entity2 family doctors may be referring gay people for controversial treatments designed to change their sexuality , a minister said last night			1
@entity1 , the care services minister , has written to @entity2 to demand assurances that gps are not making referrals for gay conversion therapy			1
he said it would be ‘ entirely wrong ’ for gps or mental health professionals to do so , and that if any evidence comes to light he would act quickly to ‘ eradicate ’ it			1
however , he ruled out a complete ban on gay conversion therapy in the @entity22 , saying he did not want doctors to fear prosecution merely for counselling someone coming to terms with their sexuality			1
the vast majority of health professionals say the so - called ‘ therapy ’ belongs to a past when homosexuality was illegal and when people believed sexuality was a choice			0
the most recent survey of psychotherapists , in 2009 , found that 17 per cent of the 1,300 who answered admitted trying to help at least one client reduce the attraction felt for someone of the same sex			0
a third of these people had been referred from within the @entity2 by their @entity43 40 per cent were apparently treated within an @entity2 practice - although it is not known whether this means their treatment was paid for by the @entity2			2
mr @entity1 spoke out after 15 mps from all parties wrote to him to demand a ban on @entity2 gay conversion therapy			1
campaigners want statutory regulation of psychotherapists , with disciplinary action against anyone involved in gay conversion therapy			1
he told @entity58 : ‘ it is based on the completely false premise that there is something wrong with you if you happen to be gay			1
i certainly want to do what i can , as a @entity64 , to eradicate this			2
support : in a debate on the issue on the @entity70 in november , @entity64 mp @entity67 said : ' in the 21st century , no lesbian , gay bisexual or transgender individual should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology ' ‘ i do n’t think there should be referrals to professionals in the @entity2			1
i have n’t seen evidence of referrals , but in a vast system [ like the @entity2 ] one imagines that could happen			1
so we have to be clear about the inappropriateness of that			0
’ he has written to @entity2 to stress that @entity2 money should not be spent in this way			0
‘ there are steps we can take to make sure it has no place in the @entity2 , ’ he said			0
‘ we can also send a clear signal that health professionals within the @entity2 should not be referring people - it would be entirely wrong to make referrals			2
’ mr @entity1 said an outright ban on the practice would be unworkable			2
‘ there will be people who want help with coming to terms with their sexuality and need to be able to seek support from a professional , ’ he said			0
it was important to avoid a situation where a doctor or therapist felt they could not counsel someone in that situation			0
‘ we must not end up with a situation where we end up with people fearing they will be prosecuted			0
’ in a debate on the issue on the @entity70 in november , @entity64 mp @entity67 said : ‘ in the 21st century , no lesbian , gay bisexual or transgender individual should be accessing this kind of voodoo psychology			0
‘ instead we should be providing services which help them give confidence and support them with their sexuality			0

@entity1 asked whether gps are making gay conversion referrals
care services minister said the treatment would be ' entirely wrong '
*pledged* to eradicate it if any evidence came to light
