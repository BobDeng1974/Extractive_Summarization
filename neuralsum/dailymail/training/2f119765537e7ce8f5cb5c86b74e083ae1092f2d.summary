by @entity1 reporter published : 09:55 est , 22 september 2012 updated : 10:06 est , 22 september 2012 prof @entity2 claims the poet continued to use the drug after he took it to relieve a chronic sore throat @entity8 was an opium addict while he wrote some of his most famous poems , a contentious new biography claims			1
dismissing other experts who believe that the @entity15 romantic poet experimented with the drug only briefly , author prof @entity2 claims that after using the drug to relieve a chronic sore throat , he continued dosing himself to ‘ keep up his spirits ’			1
prof @entity2 admits his findings in the biography @entity8 – a new life , to be published in october will be contentious			1
‘ this has never been said before : @entity8 as an opium addict is new , ’ he told @entity24			1
the professor of @entity15 literature at the @entity29 in @entity30 said : ‘ my biography takes the contrary view that the spring of 1819 was not only one of @entity8 ' most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated			2
‘ he continued dosing himself to relieve his chronically sore throat ; and that opium - induced mental instability helps to explain his jealous and vindictive mood swings regarding ( his financee ) @entity39			2
@entity8 ’ famous poems @entity40 were inspired while the poet was under the influence of opium , prof @entity2 said			1
he said : this explodes entrenched conceptions of him as a delicate , overly sensitive , tragic figure			0
‘ that @entity8 was using opium to enhance what it meant to “ fade far away , dissolve , and quite forget ” the world gives us a different @entity8 : a @entity8 whose struggle with life was more complex , and darker than we have previously thought			2
’ ‘ @entity8 's odes of spring 1819 have often been read as his most “ philosophical ” engagement with the intractable contraries of beauty and mortality , time and eternity			0
‘ to find those two odes and , i suspect , @entity61 , arose from opium reveries gives us a less intellectual or “ philosophical ” @entity8 , and a poet who is closer to the mystical aspects of romantic tradition associated with @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity76 's claims : the biography , left , by author @entity2 , right , of the @entity29 claims that the spring of 1819 was one of @entity8 ' most productive periods but also his most heavily opiated ' ‘ like @entity70 's @entity80 and like @entity71 's @entity82 , @entity81 is one of the greatest re-creations of a drug - inspired dream - vision in @entity15 literature – a poem that frankly admits his own opium habit			1
’ according to @entity90 , the poet - who was also a trained physician - had access to laudanum to administer it to his sick brother @entity94 in 1818 who was dying of @entity96			0
after @entity94 died of the disease which he gave to @entity8 , who would eventually die from it three years later , started using the drug regularly ‘ to keep up his spirits ’ according to his close friend @entity101			0
@entity101 , a writer , is said to have warned @entity8 of the ‘ danger of such a habit ’ which prof @entity2 believes ‘ suggests @entity8 was indeed an “ habitual ” user of opium and had been dosing himself for a considerable time ’			1
@entity8 first showed symptoms of @entity96 in 1820 , after losing @entity94 as well as his mother to the illness			0
' vindictive ' : @entity8 ' jealousy and mood swings regarding financee @entity39 , pictured , can be attributed to his drug addiction , the biography claims @entity117 on @entity118 was inspired by ‘ a reverie induced by taking laudanum to ease the pain of a black eye , got while playing cricket on @entity116 in march 1819 ’			1
prof @entity2 said : ‘ apparent from his up and down moods , and the increasing turmoil of his relationship with @entity39 in 1820 , a phase of his life that resembles @entity70 's opiated anguish over his unrequited passion for @entity128 's sister - in - law , @entity127 , in the years 1802 to 1804			2
’ ‘ the final , tragic twist of this story ( comes ) when @entity8 and the young painter @entity138 were voyaging to @entity139 , en route , they hoped , to find a cure for @entity8 's @entity96			0
@entity8 was ordered by his doctors to flee the @entity15 winter and move to @entity143 so he went to @entity139 and @entity144 accompanied by friend , @entity138			0
prof @entity2 claims that @entity138 stopped @entity8 taking laudanum by hiding the bottle in 1820			1
prof @entity2 said : ‘ as a result , @entity8 endured the protracted suffering of pulmonary consumption and faced his death without the panacea that had helped his brother and called into being some of the greatest poetry in the language			1
’ although the move improved his health at first , he collapsed and died on february 23 , 1821			0
@entity96 is a bacterial infection which commonly attacks the lungs and can be passed to others through kissing , sneezing , spitting or breathing			0
while it is now curable , it was responsible for one in four deaths in @entity15 in 1815			0
@entity165 , who won the @entity167 prize for biography and wrote a biography of the poet said of prof @entity2 ’s book : ‘ it 's not beyond the bounds of possibility that he explored ( the effect of the drug in his poems ) from these remembered experiences rather than from a full - on vantage point			1
‘ @entity181 is making assumptions , just as i made assumptions - that 's all we can do , because there is no hard evidence either way			0
’ the romantic poet fell in love with the teenage @entity191 when she moved in next door to his home in @entity116 , north @entity194 but their relationship was never consummated because of his highly contagious illness .			0
