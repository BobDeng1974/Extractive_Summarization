by @entity0 a trip down to the local video , and more recently dvd , store has become a thing of the past thanks to the rise of video streaming services			1
companies including @entity10 and @entity11 let viewers indulge in back - to - back episodes of hit tv series at the click of a button			2
now , a new study has shown that streaming can be much better for the environment , requiring less energy and emitting less carbon dioxide ( @entity21 ) than some traditional methods of dvd renting , buying and viewing			1
new research published in the journal @entity27 suggests that it would be more ' green ' to scrap dvds in favour of using streaming services			1
this is for two reasons , one that dvd players use more energy than comparable streaming services and also that people sometimes have to drive to buy or rent dvds the researchers , who published their study today in the journal @entity27 , cite modern devices such as laptops and tablets as the reason for this improvement			1
this is because they are much more efficient than older , energy - sapping dvd players			2
furthermore , the driving that is required to go and buy , or rent , @entity38 makes this method much more energy - and carbon - intensive			1
@entity10 has signed a deal with three small cable - providers in the @entity52 to become a regular tv channel			0
the agreements with @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 gives the internet streaming site 's subscription service a channel on @entity62 boxes that the companies provide their customers			0
it debuted on @entity66 and @entity56 in late april and is now expanding on to @entity68 's service			0
a significant proportion of the energy consumption and carbon emissions for streaming comes from the transmission of data , which increases drastically when more complex , high - definition content is streamed			0
the study was carried out by researchers from @entity78 in @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity81			0
they estimated that if all dvd viewing in the @entity52 was shifted to streaming services in 2011 , around 2 billion kg of @entity21 emissions could have been avoided and around 30 petajoules ( @entity86 ) of energy saved			1
that 's the equivalent of the amount of electricity needed to meet the demands of 200,000 @entity52 households			0
they estimated that in 2011 , 192 @entity86 of energy was used , and 10.4 billion kg of co2 emitted , for all methods of dvd consumption and streaming in the @entity52			2
from this , they calculated that one hour of video streaming requires 7.9 megajoules ( @entity86 ) of energy , compared to as much as 12 @entity86 for traditional dvd viewing , and emits 0.4 kilograms ( 0.9 pounds ) of @entity21 , compared to as much as 0.71 kg ( 1.6 pounds ) of co2 for dvd viewing			2
video streaming services such as @entity10 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 have risen hugely in popularity in the last few years and have successfully dented the sales of dvds - but the researchers say it might be time to scrap the format completely to arrive at their results , the researchers compared video streaming with four different types of dvd consumerism : dvds that are rented from online mailers ; dvds that are rented from a store ; dvds that are purchased online ; and dvds that are bought from a store			1
video streaming was limited to tv and movies and did not include shorter videos that are streamed online through @entity107 , @entity108 and so on			2
they found that video streaming and the online rental of dvds required similar amounts of energy ; however , the renting and purchasing of dvds from a store were much more energy intensive , due to the impact of driving			1
' it 's a modern - day equivalent of the debate about which is more environmentally sound - the disposable or the cloth diaper , ' says lead author of the research @entity149 from @entity78			0
' our study suggests that equipment designers and policy makers should focus on improving the efficiency of end - user devices and network transmission energy to curb the energy use from future increases in video streaming			0
' such efficiency improvements will be particularly important in the near future , when society is expected to consume far greater quantities of streaming video content compared to today			0

*scientists* say that using streaming services is better for the environment
their research found that @entity38 players are *wasteful* and not very green
also driving to a store to buy or rent a dvd in itself releases more co2
they suggest the rise of sites like @entity10 and @entity107 is good for @entity179
and they say it might be time to get *rid* of dvds *forever*
