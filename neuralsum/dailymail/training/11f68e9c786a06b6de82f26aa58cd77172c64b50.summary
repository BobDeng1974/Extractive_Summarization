mr @entity1 is survived by a wife and two children			2
no arrests have been made in the shooting			2
investigators suspect that more than one person fired at the agents			1
' it was basically an ambush , ' said @entity43 sheriff 's commander @entity42			2
' they had a little bit of a jump on us			0
it is very rocky terrain			0
we 're hoping that they hunkered down somewhere close by so that we have an opportunity to find them			0
' @entity54 and @entity55 , which are both investigating the shooting , declined to say whether investigators have recovered guns or bullet casings at the scene of the shooting			0
authorities set up a checkpoint on a dirt road about seven miles southeast of @entity65			0
a @entity4 truck and another vehicle carrying two portable toilets were allowed to drive past the roadblock			0
tight lipped : as agents search for clues , the @entity55 would not confirm any details ' due to the sensitive and on - going nature of this investigation ' the @entity75 cites a reporter from @entity77 who claimed that two suspects have been detained in @entity8 though their identities have not been released			1
agents at the checkpoint declined to comment and barred reporters from going further			1
two helicopters from federal immigration agencies could be seen from a distance circling the area			0

mesquite trees and creosote bushes dotted the landscape , and a mountain range stands nearby to the west			0
the @entity9 government has put thousands of sensors along the border that , when tripped , alert dispatchers that they should send agents to a particular location			1
' smuggling country ' : agents from multiple government agencies worked together on the search in the rugged countryside known as a ' smuggling corridor for many , many years ' ' it ’s a very rough area — it ’s mountainous , rocky , loose rock , low vegetation , ' @entity43 county sheriff 's commander @entity42 told the @entity117			1
' it ’s hard terrain to maneuver around			0
there ’s not a lot of trail systems in place			0
you ’re just trying to work your way around and not turn an ankle			0
' the agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors , said sheriff 's spokeswoman @entity134			1
it is not known whether the agents returned fire , @entity134 said			1
the wounded agent is in stable condition and should be released from the hospital later tuesday , said @entity142 , president of the @entity143 , a union representing about 17,000 border patrol agents			1

reeling : this is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010 , as the only other deaths have due to car accidents shot at : the agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches the last @entity4 agent fatally shot on duty was @entity164 , who died in a shootout with bandits near the border in december 2010			1
the @entity4 station in @entity22 , where the two agents shot tuesday were stationed , was recently named after @entity164			1
@entity164 's shooting was later linked to the government 's @entity164 gun - smuggling operation , which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for others to walk away from gun shops with weapons , rather than be arrested			0
prior to tuesday 's attack , the most recent fatality was @entity180 who died on july 6 due to injuries from an atv accident near @entity183 , @entity177 was killed on july 19 when he was killed by a passing vehicle while helping stranded motorists in @entity186 , @entity187 and his partner agent @entity188 were killed when their patrol car was hit by a freight train near @entity191 , arizona.the case that has drawn the most publicity in recent years was that of agent @entity164 , whose shooting death on december 15 , 2010 , during a sting operation shed light on the government 's ' @entity164 ' plan to track gun trafficking between the @entity9 - @entity8 border			1
authorities intended to track the guns into @entity8			1
two rifles found at the scene of @entity164 's shooting were bought by a member of the gun - smuggling ring being investigated			0
critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the specter those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence			1
' there 's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed , but because of @entity164 , we 'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill - advised gun - walking strategy , ' @entity215 senator @entity214 said in a written statement			1
the @entity164 family said that the shooting was a ' graphic reminder of the inherent dangers that threaten the safety of those who live and work near the border			2
' twenty - six @entity4 agents have died in the line of duty since 2002			2
@entity65 - area residents expressed a mix of concern and frustration about the shooting , along with recognition that the border can be a dangerous place			2
the region has seen its share of violence in recent years , including the @entity164 shooting and the slaying of a well - known rancher in 2010			0
that killing is , in part , credited with pushing @entity6 lawmakers to pass a law that requires officers , when they stop someone , to check the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally			0
' there is no security on the border - none , ' said @entity261 , who owns rental properties in @entity65 .			2
