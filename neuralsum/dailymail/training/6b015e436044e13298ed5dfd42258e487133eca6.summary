by @entity0 published : 19:36 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 19:38 est , 17 may 2013 a woman branded morbidly obese by her gp has lost 21 stone in weight after an embarrassing trip to the dentists forced her to act			2
@entity7 has gone from a size 34 to a size 14 dress after four years of shedding the pounds			1
she has lost so much weight , doctors told her last year a gastric band she had fitted was no longer working and she had been keeping the weight off herself			2
struggling with her weight : @entity7 , 42 , weighed 36 stone in 2009 and could not go upstairs without struggling for breath it took a trip to the dentist to spark the mother - of - one from @entity21 , @entity22 , into action			1
miss @entity7 said : ' it was just so embarrassing			1
i went to the dentists and they could not get the chair to lift me up			0
' i knew then that if i did n’t do something about my weight i would be lucky to survive to the end of the year			2
' at the time in 2009 , she weighed 36 stone and could not get up the stairs in her house without struggling for breath			0
she said she was depressed after years of weight gain and never allowed anyone to take photographs of her			1
' the weight creeps up on you , year after year , ' said miss @entity7			1
when she plucked up the courage to go to her gp , he warned her she was morbidly obese but it took the shock of what happened at the dentists to force a change of lifestyle			0
result : the moment a dentist 's chair could not lift @entity7 inspired her to take drastic action she said : ' i could n’t walk more than 20 yards			1
i avoided the @entity42 because he always said the same thing , that i was morbidly obese , and you do n’t want to listen , you do n’t want to hear it			0
' but it changed my mind and i knew i had to lose weight			2
' the 42 - year - old health care assistant was referred by her gp to her local @entity63 group in @entity64 , where she said she learned to 're - educate ' herself about food and change her lifestyle			1
' it ’s about smaller portion sizes and about moderating what you eat , ' she said			0
' it does get harder to lose the weight and to keep the weight off - the temptations never go away			1
' but when i go to my group , i can talk to the others , we can have a giggle and people understand your issues , which has been a great help to me			0
' with the support of her family , she also took the step of having gastric band surgery at the @entity89 hospital			0
' we thought long and hard about the risks because there was a chance i might die while in surgery , but i felt that if i did n’t do something i would be dead anyway , ' miss @entity7 added			1
two years later , her weight loss regime had been so successful she was told her gastric band had ' stopped working ' some months before and that she had been losing the weight by herself			1
now , she can walk her dog without fighting for breath and is taking her driving test next month			0
she is also thinking about getting on an aeroplane to take a holiday abroad			0
' i never wanted to face the embarrassment of thinking i would n’t fit in one of the plane ’s seats and now i just do n’t have that worry , ' she said			0
success : after joining her local @entity63 group , @entity7 cut down her portion sizes and said she had to 're - educate ' herself about food miss @entity7 added : ' i found some of my clothes from before and could not imagine me filling them - they used to be quite tight on me			1
that is a great feeling to have			0
' having reduced her body weight by more than half , miss @entity7 now wants to lose another 10 lbs so she can qualify for surgery to remove the excess skin her slimming has left behind			1
@entity121 , @entity63 group leader , said miss @entity7 was ' amazing '			1
' i ’ve never had anybody who has lost that much weight , ' she said			0
' she knew she had got to lose the weight and she also realised she could not do it alone			0
' she has come each week for four years and that takes a lot because if you have a love of food it never goes away			1
' it will always be an obstacle , trying to take you back to where you were			0
@entity63 is a tool to keep that under control			2
' she added : ' what you do n’t realise is people just see your size and until you lose the weight they never see the person you really are			2
' so i am so glad for @entity7 because she is such a witty , funny , wonderful person			2

@entity7 , from @entity21 , was so embarrassed she *resolved* to take action
joined local @entity63 and had to 're - educate ' herself about food
