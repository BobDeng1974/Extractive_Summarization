when the @entity1 began to savage thousands @entity3 , it was @entity5 head , dr. @entity6 , who promised @entity8 that a similar ' widespread outbreak ' would not occur in the @entity8 after the first @entity1 patient was diagnosed in the @entity8 , it was @entity6 who took to national television to assert that nation 's top doctors ' know how to stop @entity1 spreading in hospitals			1
' and when the man who brought @entity1 to the @entity8 died last wednesday , @entity17 was the @entity20 administration official tasked with announcing that the @entity8 government was ' stepping up protection for people coming into this country and for @entity8 related to travel			2
' @entity6 , not the ' @entity25 , ' has been at the forefront of the @entity1 crisis throughout the last several months , leading some @entity8 to wonder why the surgeon general has n't led the administration 's efforts to stop the spread of the deadly disease in @entity8			1
@entity5 director dr. @entity6 has been giving press briefings on the ebola virus from the agency 's headquarters in @entity37 , @entity38 , rather than the surgeon general , who is commonly referred to as the ' nation 's doctor ' @entity6 has become of the face of the @entity20 administration 's efforts to stop the spread of @entity1 because it 's nominee for surgeon general , dr. @entity46 , pictured here in february , has not been confirmed by the @entity48 because of his controversial views on gun violence currently the @entity8 does not have a permanent surgeon general			1
president @entity20 nominated dr. @entity46 to fill the spot last november after the previous surgeon general vacated the position			1
@entity46 's nomination has been tied up in the @entity48 since march amid concerns from conservative , gun rights group , the @entity58 , that the @entity60 and @entity61 educated doctor would seek to implement restrictions on the @entity63 if he were confirmed for the position			1
@entity65 - born @entity46 is a supporter of president @entity20 's efforts to reduce gun violence by restricting the sale of certain firearms			1
in october of 2012 he sent the following tweet out from his twitter account : ' tired of politicians playing politics w / guns , putting lives at risk b / c they 're scared of @entity58			0
guns are a health care issue			0
' the @entity58 and it 's powerful lobbying arm pounced on the statement after @entity46 , who also co-chaired a group called doctors for @entity20 , was nominated and warned @entity86 that they would punish them if they voted to confirm the 36 - year - old doctor as the spokesman for the government 's public health initiatives			1
at a nomination hearing before a @entity48 subcommittee in february , @entity46 testified that his views on gun control would not affect his ability to serve as surgeon general ' my concerns with regard to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician , he further explained and ' seeing patients in emergency rooms			1
' but that did n't quell the @entity58 's concerns that he may allow his political beliefs to seep into his medical work			0
in mid-march a spokesman for the organization told the @entity112 that ' given dr. @entity46 ’s blatant activism on behalf of gun control , that ’s not a gamble we ’re willing to take			0
' as a result , @entity46 's nomination has still not come for a vote before the @entity122 - controlled @entity48 - more than six months later - as vulnerable @entity123 in conservative - leaning states have tried to distance themselves from anti-gun efforts ahead of november 's federal elections			0
@entity46 's fight to become surgeon general had mostly been forgotten amid a number of other high - level scandals and resignations that have hit the @entity133 in recent months until @entity1 showed up on @entity8 's shores			2
now , liberals in the media are arguing that @entity46 , not @entity17 , should be out calming @entity8 and cautioning them on how they can avoid contracting the disease			0
' @entity46 has no business sitting around and waiting to be confirmed			0
the @entity20 administration should have been raising holy hell , demanding that a pre-eminent doctor get his vote on the @entity48 floor , ' news one now host @entity145 wrote in an op - ed for @entity147 titled where the @entity148 is the surgeon general ? @entity145 argued that the @entity20 administration should use @entity46 ' as the poster child for a nasty , devilish lobbying group being the de facto fourth branch of government			1
' likewise , @entity156 's @entity155 wrote in a joint op - ed with @entity156 producer @entity158 that ' thanks to @entity58 power and @entity48 cowardice , we are left with no surgeon general during a time when , we not only have @entity1 arriving on our shores , but are also dealing with the mysterious @entity166 , which is infecting and contributing to the deaths of children in the @entity8 ' @entity155 and @entity158 said that @entity6 has ' his own vital work to attend to as both head of the @entity5 and the @entity8 ambassador to the @entity172 ' and should n't have to divide his time doing the surgeon general 's job , as well			1
while the @entity8 does have an acting surgeon general , rear admiral @entity176 , @entity177 , he has opted to stay behind the scenes throughout the @entity1 scare and defer to @entity17 , instead			2
former @entity181 director @entity180 , a @entity182 cabinet member , told the @entity183 last week that in his opinion , it 's not critical that the @entity8 does not have a permanent surgeon general at this time nor is it crucial that the agency 's acting director is allowing @entity6 to take the lead on ebola outbreak prevention			2
' the surgeon general has a big brand , but in terms of their capacity to execute health response , that really is n’t their responsibility , and this is a job that @entity5 is well equipped for and they have physicians more authoritative on this particular subject , ' he said			0
the nation 's most recent surgeon general , @entity203 , disagreed			0
asked for her thoughts on the situation , the former @entity20 administration official told @entity183 ' there ’s a major role in any crisis , in any potential crisis , any potential event that people are concerned about ' for the surgeon general			2
' we need that level of trust and conversation that there is someone there in @entity222 as @entity8 ’s doctor , ' she said .			0
