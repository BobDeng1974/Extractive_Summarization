@entity0 ran out 2 - 1 winners against bitter rivals @entity2 on sunday night to move four points clear at the top of @entity5			1
@entity6 rates the players from both sides after an action - packed 90 minutes at the @entity10			2
@entity0 @entity11 8 : made two excellent saves , one from @entity14 's first - half piledriver , the second from a deflected @entity17 strike near the end			1
no chance with @entity14 's goal			1
@entity21 6 : some shocking defending at times , but as we 've come to expect , the @entity23 knows how to contribute in attack			0
his wonderful ball created @entity0 's second goal			1
@entity29 9 : this was a performance from the defender which some believed was beyond him after his fall from grace			1
got his head to every ball when it mattered and executed some perfect tackles			0
after his impressive performance , @entity29 left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend @entity41 @entity29 was at his very best at the heart of the @entity0 defence against @entity2 @entity45 8.5 : when the @entity47 was signed it turned a few heads			1
he used his own to send @entity0 1 - 0 up and defended expertly after that			1
one scary moment , when he nodded inches wide of his own goal			0
@entity51 6.5 : restrained himself going forward for the most part , but coped perfectly well with @entity54 down the wing			1
fired a late chance wide after good work by @entity58			0
@entity59 7 : tried to copy @entity61 ’ style of play , instead of rushing around in his usual bulldog style			0
some unnecessary play - acting aside , a fine performance			0
@entity59 was involved in some unnecessary play - acting but otherwise had a fine game @entity68 6.5 : not an indelible presence in this @entity0 side , but a useful one			2
the @entity71 helped shuttle the ball forwards to the attackers nicely , but could have offered more with @entity0 under the cosh in the first half			2
@entity76 7 : captained @entity0 for the first time against @entity2 and put in a mature display			1
showed he can be a tough customer when he needs to be in a midfield battle , too			0
@entity58 7.5 : nutmegged @entity81 early on , and set up @entity45 ’s goal with a wicked free kick			1
dropped out of the game for a while , but was running the show by the end			0
@entity58 set up @entity0 's opener and was a constant menace despite not being at his very best @entity90 8.5 : fought hard up front , in a long running battle with @entity92			1
got the goal he deserved with a brilliant piece of control and an instinctive finish			0
@entity99 6 : missed a golden chance in the first half , after which @entity2 broke away and equalised			2
some phenomenal dribbles , which terrified @entity2 ’s back line , but was too selfish – and wasteful - with his chances			2
@entity107 @entity61 6 : brought on for @entity108 as @entity109 tried to shut up shop			0
@entity111 6 : replaced @entity76 , coming on in what could be his final @entity113			0
little time to make an impact			0
@entity115 6 : gave @entity0 a safer look , with @entity99 making way			2
@entity90 celebrates scoring the winner for @entity0 as he continues his fine run of form @entity2 @entity121 6 : no errors , which was his main concern after his shocking performance against @entity125			1
both @entity0 goals were impossible to keep out			2
@entity127 6 : booked and was lucky not to be sent off when he tangled with @entity99			0
@entity92 : booked for going through the back of @entity90 , and done for pace by the @entity132 for the second goal			1
not his finest night , and it ended early when @entity136 hooked him for @entity138			0
@entity92 struggled with the pace of @entity90 and was eventually replaced by @entity138 @entity140 5 : caught out when @entity45 escaped his clutches and headed home the opener			1
was too slow to react to @entity90 for @entity0 ’s second			1
@entity145 7.5 : the @entity23 was a lively attacking outlet down the left , combining with @entity17 to set up @entity14 , when he hit the bar			2
@entity81 6.5 : a strong first half , helping @entity2 dominate proceedings			2
however , the midfielder has been tired in recent weeks and that took its toll in the second period , when he was quiet			0
@entity156 7 : after a three - month injury lay - off , he ’s slotted straight back into the side and it looks like he 's never been away			0
a classy customer who can hold his head high despite the defeat , playing a key role in @entity14 ’s goal			1
@entity156 has slotted straight back into the @entity2 side following a spell on the sidelines with injury @entity169 6 : the @entity2 press claim he ’s a national treasure , and he ’s been @entity2 ’s best player in recent weeks			2
however , he was quiet here , and outshone by @entity76 , the man he ’s tipped to replace in @entity176 ’s side			0
@entity54 5.5 : the @entity177 nearly had the goal he dreamed of scoring , but his close - range effort was ruled out for @entity14 being offside in the build - up			1
this was his chance to prove his doubters wrong , but was often on the fringes of the game , which wo n't ease the pressure on his back			0
@entity54 had a goal ruled out for offside and was something of a spectator for large parts of the game @entity17 8.5 : out of the six forwards , @entity17 has the lowest x factor			1
however , he was arguably the most effective here , setting up @entity14 with an impudent back - heel			2
@entity14 7 : @entity0 ’s supporters whistled and screamed at him every time he touched the ball … but he ’s used to that from the @entity202			1
scored , as he tends to do , with a poacher ’s finish			0
@entity107 @entity138 7 : came on for @entity92 to steady the ship and made a good tackle on @entity58 in the box			0
@entity208 6 : too little time to make an impact			0
@entity14 scored the equaliser but was not able to lead his side to victory at the @entity10			1

@entity90 scored the winner as @entity0 beat @entity2
@entity14 had earlier cancelled out @entity45 's opener
@entity90 was among @entity0 's best players but @entity29 stood out
@entity54 had a goal ruled out and endured another *disappointing* night
