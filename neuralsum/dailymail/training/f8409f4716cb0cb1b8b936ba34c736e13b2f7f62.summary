a @entity1 man serving life in prison for a double murder that he believes was directed by @entity5 says his ideas likely influenced a couple 's decision to fatally overdose along with their children			1
@entity12 sees himself as the prophet @entity14 and the world as hell , a philosophy that played into the september deaths of @entity19 and @entity20			1

a @entity1 couple who overdosed on drugs along with their three children was obsessed with @entity34 tragedy : @entity19 and @entity20 and three of their children , @entity38 , 14 , @entity39 , 12 , and @entity40 , 11 , were found dead inside their home in september			1
their oldest son , who survived , is pictured left police say five members of the @entity1 family found dead last fall died from methadone and other drugs , and interviews with people who knew them revealed the parents worried about a ' pending apocalypse ' @entity34 is in prison for the 1984 slayings of his sister - in - law , @entity59 , and her 15 - month old daughter , crimes which were chronicled in the 2003 @entity62			1
' the 66 - year - old said he first became close to the @entity64 about 10 years ago , after @entity20 had a dream about him while she was reading the book			1
she reached out to him , and eventually @entity20 and @entity67 became almost weekly visitors to the @entity28			1
at one point , @entity34 cut off his waist - length hair and beard at her request and sent them to the family			2
however , the friendship tapered off after the couple pleaded guilty to criminal charges including forgery and drug possession in 2008 , which ended their prison visiting privileges			1
they exchanged letters afterward , but @entity34 said @entity20 did n't believe he was @entity14 , and when he persisted she quit answering his letters			1
questions : authorities could not determine if @entity38 ( pictured ) , who was 14 at the time , had been killed or if he had taken his own life			0
he was the only one not under the covers , suggesting he had been the last to die heartbreaking : their bodies were found in a bed in the master bedroom by their eldest son and his girlfriend @entity97 and @entity12 are both in prison for the 1984 murders of @entity59 and her 15 - month - old daughter , @entity100			1
they slit their victims ' throats with a 10 - inch boning knife and later claimed @entity5 had ordered the slayings			1
the men were tried separately ; @entity12 is serving a life sentence , and @entity12 -- who claimed to have the revelation to kill -- is on death row			1
the revelation to kill their brother 's family came from @entity115 after @entity59 spoke out against her husband @entity34 joining his brother 's radical polygamist group			2
@entity97 and @entity12 in 1984			1
the brothers were tried seperately and both remain in prison @entity12 looks at evidence tuesday , april 2 , 1996 , during testimony in the retrial for the 1984 murders of @entity59 and @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity1			1
the evidence seen is a vacuum cord that was tied around @entity59 's neck @entity115 said they needed to be ' removed ' so that , as @entity5 put it , ' my work might go forward			0
' according to investigators into the @entity137 case , @entity97 had not left behind his cult - leader mentality when @entity20 first made contact with him			1
@entity141 police corporal @entity140 says that @entity97 communicated with @entity20 like she was his child -- a part of his flock			1
@entity20 and her husband became close friends with @entity34 , who believes himself to be the prophet @entity14 , for several years			1
while the @entity64 did have frequent communication with @entity34 , it did not generally include talks about the @entity150			0
the communication also ended in 2008 and police still are n't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in september			2
@entity156 - a 1,000 - year @entity155 but @entity97 's ideology seems to point toward why the @entity64 , who 'd struggled with addiction for years , might have found him so alluring			1
@entity97 explained to the @entity160 in a lengthy 2014 profile that , as a devout @entity163 child , he struggled with seductions of the flesh			0
' when i was young and going to church , i thought because i could n’t stop masturbating , that i might be an evil person , and it tormented me so much that i contemplated castration as a possible way to stop offending @entity5 , ' he said			0
so , as an adult , he began to see such desire not as a test from @entity5 , but as one of his gifts			0
he believes the righteous will be treated to a 1,000 - year party during which they 'll be filled with the light of @entity180 and have sex the likes of which have not before been experienced on @entity183			2
as the prophet @entity14 , @entity97 believes it is his duty -- as the only one who can see the continual cycle that begins at birth and starts over with the thousand - year party -- to cull from the @entity183 the ' weeds ' of the @entity190 that have grown for 6,000 years			1
only when he personally replaces these weeds with @entity5 's righteous ' wheat ' can the 1,000 party begin again			0
' when he comes back , ' @entity97 says of his @entity194 , ' he ’s gon na be smoking a doobie , saying , " tired of this world ? well , it ’s time to party			2
" i really believe it			0
' @entity12 is cuffed after his court hearing in a courtroom in @entity127 , @entity1 in 2005 as he appealed his 1996 death sentence			2
@entity34 's attorneys contend that his legal team during the 1996 trial provided him with ineffective counsel @entity34 says he had n't talked to the couple for years and did n't know of their plans or mindset			2
' i 'll miss them , but i 'm happy for them , ' he said			0
' i believe they 're in paradise now			0
' @entity34 , who is polite and friendly in conversation , has a self - devised philosophy that he refers to as his insanity ; though he says he 's not crazy			2
' my ' insanity ' messes with people 's lives , ' he said			0
' it 's just the way it is			0
' @entity20 and her husband believed that the apocalypse was near just before they killed themselves with a drug overdose and took their three children with them			1
friends and family thought that meant they would one day move somewhere remote and live ' off the grid , ' but no one thought they 'd kill themselves , police said			0
police still are n't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in september			0
but @entity34 communicated with @entity20 like she was one of his children , police said			2
