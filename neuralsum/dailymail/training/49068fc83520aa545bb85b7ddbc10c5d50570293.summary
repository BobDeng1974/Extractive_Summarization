by @entity0 last updated at 6:27 pm on 17th january 2012 a mother - of - three plagued by illness has told how her problems have been linked to an insect bite suffered 20 years ago			2
@entity5 , 31 , has been blighted by a range of medical conditions including migraines , severe fatigue , sickness , hearing difficulties and a drooping left eye			1
but it was only last year that she was able to understand the route of her failing health when medics diagnosed her with @entity18 , a bacterial infection carried by ticks			1
@entity5 , who has been plagued by health problems after she was bitten by a tick aged 11 , pictured with husband @entity22 and children @entity25 ( front ) @entity24 and @entity27 lyme disease , which @entity5 ( pictured above ) caught , is a vicious infection that attacks the immune system and can cause paralysis , encephalitis and meningitis			1
it is caused by the bacteria @entity36 , found in the digestive systems of animals such as mice , pheasants and deer			2
when a tick bites an animal carrying this bacteria , they can become infected with it			2
the tick - part of the spider family - can transfer the bacteria to a human by biting and attaching itself to a person 's skin for days			0
lyme disease is transmitted only if the tick remains attached for more than 36 hours			0
although you may think it easy to tell if a tick was on your body , they are only a few millimetres in size and do not hurt , so are easy to @entity59 while the @entity61 estimates that there are fewer than 2,000 cases of @entity18 a year in the @entity64 , it is on the rise			1
the first symptom is a red circular skin rash , which subsides after a week or two			0
a high temperature , muscle pain and joint swelling are then symptoms			0
she suddenly remembered a school trip to @entity74 in 1991 when she was 11 - years - old , during which she was bitten on the leg by a tick			1
despite the bite causing a rash she thought nothing of it , but now she believes it is responsible for years of poor health , which have made her feel like she has the body of ' a 90 - year - old '			0
mrs @entity5 , of @entity87 , @entity88 said : ' i was never the same after coming home from that trip			1
i could n’t get better afterwards but they could n’t find what was wrong with me			0
' i had lots of symptoms but they were put down to other things			0
but when i found out about @entity18 , it was like a jigsaw puzzle fitting together at last			1
' i 'm 31 but can feel like i ’m in a 90 - year - old 's body			0
' for years medics were baffled by her catalogue of illnesses but it was only when she chanced upon @entity18 on the internet last year that she realised it could hold the key to her health problems			1
a basic @entity111 test came back negative , so mrs @entity5 turned to the @entity112 in @entity113 where results , sent off to a @entity116 specialist , proved positive			1
now mrs @entity5 fears for her husband @entity22 's health as @entity18 could potentially be passed through sexual contact			1
she also worries about her children @entity120 , nine , @entity27 , six and @entity25 , 18 months , although there is no conclusive evidence that @entity18 can be passed to babies through pregnancy			2
in the meantime antibiotics have helped ease her range of symptoms			0
she added : ' i just want to put out a warning for people to be cautious when they ’re out in the countryside			0
' a simple bite can turn your world upside down			0
' @entity135 and friends are now fundraising to enable the @entity5 family to get tested and undergo necessary treatment .			2
