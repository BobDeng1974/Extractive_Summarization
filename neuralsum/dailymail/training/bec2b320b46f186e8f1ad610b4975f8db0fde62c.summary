by @entity0 this extraordinary ‘ bayonet hat ’ would have allowed @entity3 soldiers in the @entity4 to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go - ahead , it has emerged			1
however , the incredibly rare prototype cap - which comes with a sharp six inch blade fixed to the top of it - was deemed too dangerous for soldiers after being considered by the @entity15			1
it has now been discovered nearly 100 years after the war and is expected to sell for more than £ 3,000			1
the extraordinary ' bayonet hat ' , was the brainchild of @entity3 solicitor @entity19 , would have allowed soldiers in the @entity4 to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go - ahead by the @entity15 it is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the hat , either by running at them head first and ramming the weapon into them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife the item was the brainchild of @entity3 solicitor @entity19 who patented the invention in 1916 and offered it up to the @entity15 for consideration			1
he gave them a prototype cap along with drawings showing how it worked			1
it is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the top of the hat , either by ramming their head at them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife			1
the design allowed the knife to be covered by a scabbard and locked in the down position when the wearer was in his own trench			2
but , when in close combat attack , the soldier would have flicked the knife 90 degrees upwards and used it as a weapon along with his rifle and regular bayonet			2
both army - issue caps and steel helmets were to be modified with the foldable knife , with the latter doubling as a small shield and the dagger acting as the handle			2
however , the @entity15 did n’t take up the option of the bayonet cap as it was considered too dangerous for the wearer			1
the design allowed the knife to be covered by a scabbard and locked in the down position when in the trenches			0
however , the @entity15 considered the bayonet cap to be too dangerous for the wearer if the prototype had been given the go ahead , both army - issue caps and steel helmets would have been modified with the foldable knife , with the latter doubling as a small shield and the dagger acting as the handle it was one of numerous quirky weapon inventions that were produced during the @entity4 in a bid to give the @entity3 soldiers on the @entity93 the upper hand			1
now the prototype hat , complete with knife fixed in position , has emerged for sale and is expected to sell for more than £ 3,000 when it is auctioned on june 25			1
the original patent document is being sold with it , along with the basic drawings			0
@entity103 , of @entity104 in @entity105 which is selling the item , said : ‘ many inventors and members of the public came up with ideas for items of uniform that may have helped protect the soldiers at the front			1
‘ this bayonet hat was meant for hand - to - hand combat and would have quite a barbaric weapon when you think about it			2
‘ we can only assume this item was made to present to the @entity15 to gain approval , but obviously was not considered as was not by any means practical			1

it is truly a unique item , that you will never find another example of			2
’ the prototype has been held by the @entity149 in the @entity150 for many years			2
the centre was set up by the late philanthropist @entity152			0
he died last year from cancer and the hat has now returned to @entity3 where it is now being sold			1
@entity156 , of the @entity157 , said : ‘ after the war settled down into trench warfare , uniforms and weapons were tailored for hand - to - hand fighting			0
‘ this hat is one of the weird and wonderful inventions that people produced to give the @entity3 the upper hand over their opponents			1
’ tanks : the first tank , the @entity3 @entity170 , was designed in 1915 by @entity171 it was first demonstrated to the @entity173 in february , 1916 before going into combat at the @entity175 in september of that year			1
@entity3 tanks were originally referred to as ‘ landships ’ by the @entity178 , but were later named tanks after it emerged factory workers at @entity171 referred to the first prototype as ‘ the tank ’ because of its resemblance to a steel water tank			1
the @entity186 fielded their first tanks in april , 1917 and went on to produce more tanks than all the other combatants combined			0
the first tank , the @entity3 @entity170 ( pictured ) was designed in 1915 by @entity171 it first went into battle at the @entity175 in september 1916 flamethrowers : the flamethrower , which projects a long , controllable stream of fire , was first used by @entity198 troops in february , 1915			1
some flamethrowers project a stream of ignited flammable liquid while some project a long gas flame			0
they can be used hand - held or attached to a tank			0
the first design for a modern flamethrower was submitted to the @entity208 by @entity209 in 1901			0
they are primarily used in battlefield fortifications , bunkers , and other protected emplacements , causing horrific injury or death to enemy soldiers in confined spaces			2
aircraft carriers : the first proper aircraft carrier was the @entity220 , which was built for the @entity221 during the @entity4			0
it was originally a 786 foot long battle cruiser equipped with two 18 - inch guns , but was reclassified as an aircraft carrier in september 1925			2
the forward turret was removed and an area suitable for landing aircraft was installed in its place			0
@entity220 was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like @entity233 entered service in the late 1930s			0
in august , 1917 , while performing trials , squadron commander @entity235 landed a @entity237 , believed to have been @entity238 , successfully on board @entity220 , becoming the first person ever to land an aircraft on a moving ship			0
the first proper aircraft carrier was @entity220 ( pictured ) , which was built for the @entity221 during the @entity4 @entity243 : the @entity4 accelerated development of aviation technology and pilot training			0
before the war , there was very little , if any , communication between the pilot of an aircraft and the mainland			0
however , during the war , the @entity253 installed the first operational two - way radio in planes			0
developments for the radio began in @entity259 in 1915 and by 1916 , technicians could send a radio telegraph over a distance of 140 miles			0
in 1917 , a human voice was transmitted by radio from a plane in flight to an operator on the ground for the very first time			0
in 1921 , @entity270 in @entity271 was the first airport in the world to officially introduce air traffic control to commercial flights .			0

hat with six inch blade on top was brainchild of @entity3 solicitor @entity19
soldiers could have used it to attack enemy by charging head first at them
