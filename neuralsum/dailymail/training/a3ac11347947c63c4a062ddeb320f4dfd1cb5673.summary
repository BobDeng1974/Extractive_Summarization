by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 20 august 2012 updated : 10:14 est , 22 august 2012 when @entity2 and @entity3 were awoken in the early hours of the morning to the horrific news that their two sons had been attacked by a gang while returning home that night , they felt as though their world had caved in			1
the couple discovered from the two officers at the door of their home in @entity14 that one of their sons , @entity17 , was fighting for his life			2
he later died from the injuries he sustained in the brutal attack			0
the @entity21 would have been forgiven for holding onto the anger they felt at the perpetrators forever			1
compassion : @entity2 and @entity3 found it in their hearts to forgive the men who killed their son @entity30 indeed , many couples crumble under the weight of the loss - the marriages of parents who have lost children are , tragically , more likely to end in divorce			1
but 10 years on from @entity17 's death , @entity2 and @entity3 have not only let go of their anger - but in an extraordinary show of compassion , they have managed to forgive the thugs that beat their son to death			1
the couple say they could not have done it without the help of the restorative justice scheme , which allowed the couple the opportunity to come face to face with the men who killed @entity17			1
in a meeting arranged by the @entity59 programme and mediators at the charity @entity61 ) , the couple met with two of the three perpetrators responsible for the crime when they came to the end of their sentences			1
in a moment of heart - wrenching humanity that brings tears to the eyes , @entity2 says that when one of the offenders entered the room , all he wanted to do was hug him			1
' i held my hands out to him and he came to me and hugged me , ' @entity2 says			1
' he grabbed hold of me and would n't let go			0
he cried and cried , ' @entity2 says			1
' as i cuddled him , he whispered " i 'm sorry " in my ear			0
' then he turned to @entity3 and said simply , " may i ? " @entity3 nodded , and he went to hug her too			1
he said " sorry , " again and again			0
' ' we said " i forgive you "			0
one of the offenders admitted to the @entity21 that for the first two years of his eight year sentence , he did n't spare a thought for the victims of his crimes			1
tragic : @entity30 was attacked by a group of youths as he walked home with his brother @entity90 but after he took part in a victim awareness course in prison , he says he could n't get @entity94 out of his ' head and heart ' and he felt an urgent need to apologise to the @entity21			1
' he told us that he ’d been a 15 - year - old coward			0
he acknowledged he 'd kicked @entity30 then left him in the road and run away			1
' that was something we 'd waited 10 years to hear			2
he was n’t at all the person we ’d expected to see			0
' asked how they found it in their hearts to forgive their son 's killers , @entity2 displays a compassion many of us would find impossible			1
' these boys were just 15 , 16 and 19 when they attacked @entity30 , ' he told @entity112			1
' we do n't blame them - we blame the drug dealers that gave them the drugs they were on that night ; the people who bought them alcohol			0
' neither do the @entity21 blame the parents - in fact , they reserve enormous sympathy for the mother and father of one of the offenders in particular , who have spoken on the @entity129 about the horrific moment their front door was kicked down by 30 policeman			1
' they are decent people , ' @entity2 says			1
' but they had to cope with something most of us could never imagine happening to us			0
' i always say there are four lots of people who lost - us , and the parents of those three boys			0
they have to live for the rest of their lives with the stigma that their sons are murderers			0
' @entity2 's seemingly limitless compassion does not end there			1
he set out to get one of the offenders - an artist - a job and a place on a mentoring programme to become a curator			2
the man is now working for a charity - @entity2 is not allowed to say which			1
' i called the director and got him a place , ' @entity2 says			1
' the secretary who took the call was in tears when she heard the story			0
' now he 's been mentored into the art world as a curator			2
is n't that better than him walking the streets ? ' @entity2 says that he has visited the offender at the art institution to see how he is getting on , but that he does n't have daily contact			1
' it would n't be fair to check up on him , ' @entity2 says			2
' it would throw everything out , upset the apple cart			0
we know he is doing well there and that 's enough			2
' @entity2 and @entity3 have published a booklet - entitled five minutes of @entity177 - to bring awareness to youngsters of the consequences of crime			1
the booklet 's name comes from an incident that happened in the riots of last summer			2
two boys were passing through a riot zone and happened to put their hands through a broken window to lift two packs of chewing gum			0
they were later identified and sentenced to months in prison			0
@entity2 uses this as an example of how five minutes of ' madness ' can change the course of a young person 's life forever			1
the booklet - which they mark with a price of £ 1.50 but give away ( kids are more likely to read something if it has a price tag on it and they think they 've got something for free , he says ) - contains the stories of the boys in the riot , as well as a boy who knifed someone to ' gain respect			0
' ' we ask the question , " why is that sort of respect more important than your family 's respect ? " , and try to get the kids to think about what they would lose by going to jail			2
' lost youth : @entity30 as a teenager celebrating his birthday the @entity21 now advise the probation service on restorative justice too			1
' each meeting takes months of planning , ' he says			0
' the scheme is victim - led , not offender - led			2
there are safety valves all over the place - get out rooms for both parties			0
' it 's important that the victim gets to make decisions , even down to who will be in the room first ' @entity2 says that in his and @entity3 's instance , he chose to be in the room first - so that he could hold out his hands to the offenders			1
' but the most important part of the process is the tea and biscuits after the official meeting , ' he says			2
' with the second boy , after the meeting [ which is chaired by a counsellor ] we talked for four hours			0
he 's a plasterer learning the trade , and he told us all about his girlfriend and the baby that 's on the way			0
' neither of us had to stay for the tea and biscuits - but it was the most healing part			0
' it was a welcome moment for the @entity21 , who have battled with their own guilt in the years following the death of @entity30			1
the family had only recently moved from @entity268 to @entity269 in @entity14 , close to where the fatal attack occurred , assuming it would be a safer place to bring up their sons			0
for @entity2 , one of the most painful elements of the events that unfurled that night is the knowledge that he had turned down @entity30 's request for a lift home			1
' he asked me to drive him , but i said i was too tired , ' @entity2 says			2
' then he went to meet @entity90 and said they should get a mini cab - but @entity90 had just been paid , and said that as it was a nice evening , they should walk			0
' ' the hardest thing for me to accept was that @entity30 had tried to get a lift twice - and twice he had been turned down			2
' it took a policeman to teach me to forgive myself			0
he said to me , " @entity291 , ' what if ' wo n't bring @entity30 back			2
you 're just destroying yourself			0
" it was better than any psychiatrist			0
' @entity2 's final word is one that many will find inspiring			1
' if we go around angry , what kind of example is that to set ? ' he asks			0
' this was the best way we could find to honour @entity30			2
we could have had a park bench made with a plaque on it - or we could do what we are doing			0
that 's the way we look at it			0
' what 's more important ? a park bench or changing someone 's life ? ' the @entity314 will be broadcast on @entity315 tonight ( monday 20 august ) at 8pm			0
@entity2 and @entity3 will be on @entity14 tonight at 5.30pm to talk about their experience with the restorative justice scheme .			1
