soaring immigration means most parts of the country could have fewer available primary school places than pupils in just two years			1
pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration , forcing schools to boost class sizes and add classrooms			1
the @entity12 warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate that is needed			1
pressure on the education system has intensified following a baby boom and continued migration , forcing schools to boost class sizes and classrooms - but say they may not be able to continue doing so its analysis of official figures indicates that by september next year , two in five local authorities in @entity25 will have more children ready to start school than there are places			1
this will increase to more than half by 2017/18 and to three in five by the following year			0
it comes after the head of @entity35 sir @entity34 warned last year that schools were struggling to cope with growing numbers of migrant pupils			2
‘ when they ’re faced with an influx of children from other countries , they need the resources and capacity to deal with it and if those resources are n’t there , that ’s a big issue for government , ’ he said			0
in 2013 , a leaked paper prepared by the @entity53 revealed a steady increase in the number of babies being born has helped fuel the crisis			0
the @entity12 said that councils have created more than 300,000 primary school places since may 2010 , with many increasing class sizes			1
money set aside for school repair programmes has been diverted into converting areas such as music rooms into classrooms			2
the @entity12 warned they may not be able to create more places at the rate needed but the association warned the situation is reaching a ‘ tipping point ’ and made a fresh call for an incoming government to hand councils enough cash and fresh powers to open new schools and establish more places			1
it comes as parents brace themselves for ‘ primary school offers day ’ later this month , when councils will tell families whether they secured their first choice of school			0
last year , research based on an @entity12 report found an extra 130,000 primary places would be needed across the country within three years			1
many parts of the country saw a rise in applications last year and up to four in ten children were denied admission to their chosen primary schools			1
@entity96 , the chairman of the @entity12 ’s children and young people board , said : ‘ mums and dads rightly expect their child to be able to get a school place where they live			1
‘ but our fear is that we will reach a tipping point when councils or schools can not afford the massive cost of creating places or find the space necessary for new classes			2
’ yesterday , @entity111 seized on the predictions to attack the @entity114 ’s free schools programme , claiming that it was creating extra places in areas where they were not needed			2
@entity111 ’s education spokesman @entity118 said : ‘ @entity120 ’s crisis in school places is yet more evidence the @entity124 plan is failing children and working families			1
‘ make no mistake , his decision to plough hundreds of millions of taxpayers ’ money on free schools into areas where there are no shortages of school places comes at the expense of the families in the areas where there is a desperate need			1
’ according to the @entity12 , no areas currently have more pupils than places , as councils in oversubscribed parts of the country have managed to create enough slots			1
of the more than half of areas expected to have more pupils than places by 2017/18 , the worst hit will be in @entity153 and the @entity154			0
unless action is taken , the @entity12 estimates that @entity156 in @entity153 will have 122 pupils for every 100 places , while @entity159 in @entity160 will have 120 and @entity161 will have 114			2
the worst - hit areas are those which tend to be popular with both young families and migrants			0
' human right ' : play can help children develop socially children should be allowed to learn through playing in the classroom until they reach the age of seven , a union says			0
many pupils are not ready to sit down to do formal reading , writing and maths when they start school , according to the @entity177			1
instead the union is expected to call for ‘ play in the curriculum ’ throughout infant schools , at its annual conference this weekend			0
the union is also due to raise the issue of lunch and break times , which it believes are being used for ‘ coaching and cramming ’ too often			0
members believe this deprives youngsters of their ‘ fundamental human right to play ’ and socialise with their classmates			0
instead , schools should follow the lead of countries such as @entity197 and introduce 45 - minute lessons immediately followed by 15 - minute playtimes , the teachers said			0
a resolution due to be put forward at the conference tomorrow says : ‘ primary schools are now being driven more and more towards a test and accountability culture which in turn makes them drive children of primary age to be educated in a formal way			2
’ it goes on to suggest that learning through play is known to help youngsters develop vital communication and social skills and that ‘ over-formalisation of learning can cause disaffection with school ’			0
speaking ahead of the conference , @entity177 general secretary @entity219 said many children are not ready for the ‘ formal , sitting down , “ come on let ’s do some work ” stage ’ before they are seven			0
‘ there is a question about whether we ’re expecting children to do things they ’re not developmentally ready for , ’ she said			0
the resolution comes amid growing debate over what children should learn , with politicians and education experts increasingly calling for schools to instil and teach values and abilities such as character , teamwork and resilience alongside academic subjects .			2
