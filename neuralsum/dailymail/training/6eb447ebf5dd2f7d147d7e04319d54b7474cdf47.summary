by @entity0 published : 15:28 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 18:39 est , 24 january 2014 @entity3 's anti-gay remarks have apparently driven away viewers as quickly as ducks fly away from shotguns as his reality show recorded its lowest viewership in the past 13 months			1
the only other time that @entity10 has only 6.65 million viewers for an original episode - like it had last week - was back in december of 2012 when the show 's second season finale pulled in their lowest numbers to date			1
@entity16 reports that in the week - to - week numbers released by @entity20 , the @entity18 reality show only hit a 3.3 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 , and slid even lower to 2.9 in the targeted demo of more ideal viewers by advertising standards			1
at that time , they were able to draw in 12 million viewers			1
that was long before @entity3 landed the family - and his show - in trouble following an interview with @entity46 wherein he labeled homosexuality a sin and also offended african - americans			1
the remarks saw @entity18 initially suspend the star before an intense backlash by fans forced the network to reverse its decision and reinstate him			2
the episodes , like almost all of the season , had already been shot when the contentious article hit newsstands			2
earlier this month , it emerged @entity3 was plotting revenge on the tv network behind his hit show and reportedly has a plan in the works to move his family - plus millions of dollars of advertising and merchandise revenue - to another broadcaster			1
humiliated by @entity18 's attempt to silence his conservative religious message , @entity3 - whose @entity74 business is worth an estimated $ 15 million - is secretly plotting to form his own tv production company so he can jump ship to a @entity78 channel more in keeping with his views			1
the @entity3 clan are worth an estimated $ 15 million based of the back of the @entity74 that @entity3 launched back in the 1970 's the @entity3 clan have teamed up with @entity82 to create nine different shotguns , as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol @entity3 , 67 , recently served a short suspension from the hit show after his homophobic and racially insensitive comments but a massive outpouring of support from @entity92 supporters including @entity93 convinced @entity18 to take @entity3 back or risk losing their most important cash cow			1
the public support for the comments have convinced the wily businessman that he and his family could be better served elsewhere on a network more understanding of his views â € “ such as overtly religious tv networks @entity103 and @entity105			0
he is also reported to be unhappy at how @entity18 has portrayed the extremely wealthy @entity3 clan as ignorant hillbillies			1
' @entity18 messed with the wrong redneck , ' a source close to the show told the @entity111			1
' @entity3 has agreed to return , but heâ € ™ s already working on getting out their contracts			2
' back in august the @entity3 clan signed a new contract with @entity18 for $ 200,000 per episode			1
that contract is supposed to keep the family tied to the network for several more seasons , but @entity3 is confident that he can get them out of it on a technicality after the forthcoming fifth season ends			1
' he 's confident lawyers can find a loophole and get them out of any long - term commitments , ' said the source			2
' @entity3 wants to use his company name @entity74 as the title for an entirely new show that they can produce themselves and be in control of what goes on			2
' @entity3 founded @entity74 back in the 70 's , selling duck calls that developed a loyal following among hunters			1
now that the family are stars in a top - rated cable - tv series , their business has expanded to sell a vast array of backwoods - themed merchandise via a number of national retailers			1
shoppers at @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 can find @entity74 branded items including dvds , $ 15 action figures , $ 50 camouflage bedding sets , video games , throw rugs , a cookbook , coolers , t - shirts , caps , hoodies , underwear and , of course , the duck calls that started it all			0
the businessman is set to capitalize even further on his huge popularity with conservatives with the launch of his own line of @entity74 guns , reported @entity175			0
the @entity3 clan have teamed up with @entity82 to create nine different shotguns , as well as two semiautomatic rifles and a semiautomatic pistol			2
the shotguns come in a ' waterfowl pattern ' camouflage design and @entity82 has already begun shipping them to distributors			0
@entity3 , the patriarch of the " @entity10 " tv series , center , leaves the @entity187 's @entity186 in @entity188 , @entity189			1
on sunday , dec. 22 , 2013			0
@entity3 was suspended in early december for homophobic comments the family features prominently in a series of ads for the new guns on @entity82 's website			2
in one of the videos @entity3 says : ' do you know what makes me happy ladies and gentlemen ? to blow a mallard drake 's head smooth off			2
' not all of the weapons are intended for duck hunting			0
the pistol and one of the rifles have military - style designs with large capacity magazines holding at least 25 rounds			0
the rifle has some of the features of an assault rifle , but with a relatively low .22 caliber			0
on its website @entity82 says the .22 - caliber pistol is ' perfect for small game , plinking , target shooting - or clearing cottonmouths out of your duck blind			0
' all the firearms come with an @entity227 flag bandana ' like the one worn by @entity228 , ' one of @entity3 's sons			1
in an earlier statement to @entity232 , the @entity3 family said they were ' excited to keep making a quality tv show for our dedicated fans , who have showed us wonderful support			1
' we will continue to represent our faith and values in a positive way through @entity10 and our many projects that we are currently working on			0
' stardom : two of the unlikely reality tv stars of @entity10 , brothers @entity245 ( left ) and @entity3 @entity18 initially took action after @entity3 's comments caused uproar , saying his views were ' disappointing ' and that @entity18 has always been ' strong supporters and champions of the lgbt community			1
' now , the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch 's remarks			0
' while @entity3 's comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs , and his own personal journey , he and his family have publicly stated they regret the " coarse language " he used and the mis - interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article			1
' he also made it clear he would " never incite or encourage hate			0
" we at @entity273 expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article , and reiterate that they are not views we hold , ' read the statement			0
the homophobic comments from the born - again @entity78 included such insights as , ' it seems like , to me , a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man 's anus			2
' that 's just me			0
i 'm just thinking : there 's more there ! she 's got more to offer			0
i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i 'm saying ? but hey , sin : it 's not logical , my man			2
it 's just not logical			0
' he also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists , saying , ' we never , ever judge someone on who 's going to heaven , hell			0
that 's the @entity305 's job			0
we just love ' em , give ' em the good news about @entity307 - whether they 're homosexuals , drunks , terrorists			0
we let @entity311 sort ' em out later , you see what i 'm saying ? ' @entity316 hit back soon after the interview was released online , calling him a ' stain ' on the network			0
@entity316 spokesperson @entity321 told @entity322 news : ' @entity3 and his family claim to be @entity78 , but @entity3 's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true @entity78 believe .			1
