a @entity1 car park attendant who posted shocking pictures on @entity3 of him holding what appeared to be a real gun at the head of his two - year - old nephew has been forced to apologize after the images went viral			1
@entity9 , 26 , took the two images of him with his nephew at home in @entity13 , a borough of @entity14 , and then decided it would be amusing to upload them when he got to work			1
but neither social media users nor his bosses were impressed when the photos went viral , causing a storm of protest and forcing the man to issue a @entity24 video apologizing for the act a few days later			1
‘ have you seen these images ? check his @entity3 profile out , this is not a man , it is a monster , ’ wrote one of the many critical posters			0
another wrote : ‘ the true face of a coward			0
’ online users also quickly discovered that this was n't the first time @entity9 had done something like this			2
@entity9 explained that he was only playing with his young nephew when he held a ' toy ' gun to the boy 's head , but many social media users did n't find the joke to be funny			1
' the true face of a coward , ' wrote one			0
last summer he had uploaded a similar photograph in which he was aiming the same apparent toy gun at a woman			2
‘ taking and uploading those images was a mistake			0
and i can confirm that it was only a toy gun and there were no consequences for the child as a result of the pictures , ’ said @entity9 in his apology video			1
‘ the young boy is my nephew who lives in the same house as me and we were playing			2
but i accept they were open to misinterpretation and i want to apologize through social networks to the netizens and also the authorities for my foolish action			0
‘ i have already contacted police and told them that the gun is a toy gun and i have offered to provide it if needed as proof of my claim			0
