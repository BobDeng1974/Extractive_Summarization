by @entity1 reporter published : 13:41 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 14:53 est , 27 august 2012 a plane that crashed into spectators at an air race in @entity6 last year bore modifications that weakened its structure and showed evidence that the pilot flew it beyond its limits , investigators said monday			1
the @entity12 deemed the failure of a tail structure to be the probable cause of the crash of the souped - up @entity19 - era @entity18 fighter that killed pilot @entity21 and 10 people on the ground at last year 's @entity6 in @entity6			1
more than 70 were injured			2
leeward also was blamed for failing to fully document and test extensive modifications to the aircraft before the september 2011 crash			1
modified : the ' @entity28 ' @entity18 had a series ill - tested changes that make it weaker , less stable and too fast crash : this is the split - second before the @entity19 - era plane crashed into spectators -- killing 10 people on the ground , as well as the pilot board member @entity39 said : ' if you want to go out and fly fast and try to win , that 's one thing			1
' ' if you 're modifying an aircraft without fully understanding how the modifications can affect the aerodynamics , you 're playing @entity46 roulette , ' @entity39 said			0
structural modifications of the aircraft dubbed the @entity28 made it lighter and reduced drag , according to the @entity12 report			1
but flight control modifications also made the aircraft less stable			2
the @entity12 found that an elevator trim tab malfunction created aerodynamic instability that made @entity21 's plane uncontrollable			1
high - resolution photos show the skin wrinkling and a the canopy separating the plane seconds before the crash , and @entity12 investigators later found loose screws in the crucial tail assembly			1
at a board hearing in @entity65 , chairwoman @entity63 blamed the 74 - year - old @entity21 for ' operating at the edge of the envelope ' without fully reporting and testing modifications to his plane			1
horror : more than 70 people were injured in the crash september 16 , 2011 , pictured a split - second after it occurred tricked out : @entity28 had its wings cut , its cockpit sheared down , the dorsal fuel tank removed and its tail clipped -- all in an effort to make it faster blame : @entity21 was faulted for not reporting or testing the modifications to his aircraft @entity21 was ' incapacitated ' and probably became unconscious when gravitational forces reached 17 times normal as the propeller aircraft -- flying faster than it ever had before -- pitched skyward , rolled upside down and slammed nose - first into the tarmac amid rows of box seats , @entity12 investigators found			1
the tail stabilizer fell from the plane during the steep climb			0
@entity12 officials say @entity21 had perhaps one second to respond , but the @entity94 forces on his body far exceeded the levels of human tolerance			2
people can begin to experience loss of consciousness at @entity101			0
with races set to start september 12 , the five - member panel has already issued several preliminary reports and recommendations for the @entity107 and race organizers to improve safety			1
some recommendations were modified on monday			0
@entity63 noted that the board is an independent investigative and recommendation body , not a regulator			0
it 's up to others to implement them , ' she said			0
' they 've done that			0
' a spokesman for the air races said last week that event officials would n't comment on @entity12 reports ahead of the board 's findings on the cause of the crash			1
but he said event officers were improving preflight inspections			0
efforts to reach @entity21 family members monday in @entity132 , @entity133 , were n't immediately successful			2
@entity12 officials say the 530 mph that @entity21 reached during a qualifying race was about 40 mph faster than he had ever gone before			1
his age and physical condition were n't considered significant factors in the crash , but @entity63 was critical of @entity21 's record - keeping and reports of the modifications that he had made			1
' he put that he was 59 years old on the entry form , ' the board chairwoman said			0
' anatomy of a disaster : this is a detailed map of the flight path and crash site of the @entity28			2
the @entity12 provided a detailed analysis of the horrific accident examination : the @entity12 offered a list of causes of the crash and several safety recommendations the air race championship , entering its 49th year , is the only event of its kind in the world			2
it draws thousands every year to @entity161 , where it features aircraft flying at speeds of over 500 mph sometimes wingtip - to - wingtip around an oval pylon track			2
the crash spawned civil liability lawsuits against the pilot 's family and mechanics and the host organization			0
some critics called for ending the event , but organizers pressed forward with plans for this year 's races amid promises that most @entity12 safety recommendations would be implemented			0
the @entity179 and the @entity180 balked at requiring pilots to wear flight suits designed to mitigate high gravitational forces			0
they said the expensive suits might prove too bulky for cramped cockpits and too hot during competition			0
insurance premiums jumped from $ 300,000 last year to $ 2 million this year , but the @entity190 state tourism commission last month approved a $ 600,000 sponsorship to help the @entity192 meet a sept. 1 deadline for its final insurance payment .			0

ten spectators were killed when @entity21 lost control of his wwii - era @entity18 . more than 70 were injured
@entity21 , who died in the crash , was blamed for not testing the changes to his aircraft ' @entity28 '
air races will go on as *scheduled* in september , but with a new $ *2million* insurance premium -- six times higher
@entity21 could not regain control of his plane because he likely passed out from *excessive* g - force during a maneuver
@entity21 was flying 530mph -- 40mph faster than he had ever flown before in the craft
