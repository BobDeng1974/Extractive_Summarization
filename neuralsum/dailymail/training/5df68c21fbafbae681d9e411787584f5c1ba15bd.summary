by @entity0 published : 02:03 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 04:24 est , 9 april 2013 experts have warned production in the world 's best wine regions could fall by two thirds because of climate change			1
there will be a sharp decline in wine production from @entity11 , in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 in @entity16 , by 2050 , a study has said			1
but the change will see a ' big push ' into areas which had previously been thought of as unsuitable - such as @entity20 and @entity21			1

experts have warned production in the world 's premier wine regions could fall by two thirds because of climate change wine grapes are known to be sensitive to changes in temperature , rain and sunshine			1
@entity32 , a senior scientist at @entity33 and an author of the study said climate change will lead to a ' huge shakeup in the geographic distribution of wine production ' because of big changes in regions enjoying the cool winters and hot dry summers that produce good grapes			1
he told the @entity44 : ' it will be harder and harder to grow those varieties that are currently growing in places in @entity47			0
' the findings are published in the journal @entity50			0
the researchers used 17 different climate models to ascertain the effects on nine major wine - producing areas			1
changing face of wine production : @entity57 shows the change in suitability for wine production between now and 2050			2
areas that are currently suitable for wine production but wo n't be in 2050 are red			0
areas that are suitable at present and are still suitable in 2050 are green			0
areas which will become suitable are light blue and dark blue the @entity68 vineyard in @entity69 , outside @entity11 - one of the areas experts have claimed could suffer from climate change they used two different climate futures for 2050			1
one assumed a @entity78 ( @entity77 ) warming , the other a @entity80 increase			0
the most drastic decline was predicted in @entity47 , where the scientists found a 85 per cent decrease in production in @entity11 , @entity85 and @entity13			2
in wine growing areas of @entity89 , there was a forecast 74 per cent drop , and @entity16 , a 70 per cent fall			2
the scientists also predicted a sharp decline for wine growers in the @entity95 area of @entity96 with falls of 55 per cent , and @entity99 's wine producers would expect losses of about 40 per cent			0
but the change in climate could see a boom in new world wine in new territory such as @entity20 and the hills of central @entity21			1
however , @entity107 , a scientist for the @entity108 and an author of the paper , warned the search for new wine country could unearth a host of new potential problems , as many of the areas being touted for production are home to endangered wildlife			0
she said : ' wine is going to be on the move in the future as will wildlife			0
this adaptation has the potential to threaten the survival of wildlife			0

experts warn of huge climate change in nine major wine areas
@entity11 , in @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 in @entity16 could be *hit*
but will be a ' big push ' into areas once thought unsuitable , such as @entity21
