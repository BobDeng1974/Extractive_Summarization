by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 04:14 est , 14 march 2013 they are hardly worlds apart on the cultural front			0
but that has n't stopped @entity4 drawing up a new 44 - page guide to @entity6 for its @entity8 staff to ensure they can adapt to life in this country			2
the handbook covers everything from helpful reminders to leave firearms at home and what time to eat breakfast to definitions of fish and chips and how to navigate your way round @entity23			1
called a guide to @entity26 in @entity27 , it has been issued to staff who are relocating to the computer giant 's new @entity30 research hq in the city			1
spelling it out : @entity4 has issued a 44 - page handbook @entity35 to @entity26 in @entity27 to explain the ways of @entity6 life to @entity8 staff relocating to its @entity6 offices in the city covering all bases : this section entitled shipping and importing details which are not allowed into the country breaking it down : the guide has been drawn up for staff who are moving to the computer giant 's new @entity30 research hq in @entity27 ( pictured ) @entity8 are warned not to bring firearms , stun guns , obscene material , drugs or dead animals through @entity6 customs			1
according to the guide , fish and chips is ' a national treat of fish , e.g. cod , fried in a crispy batter			1
' when it comes to pubs readers are told they are ' much more than plain bar ' and to expect ' homely places full of historical character ( and characters ! ) ' one laughably obvious description says @entity6 @entity72 takeaways are known as ' @entity72 ' and cover ' south east asian cuisine '			2
the guide says : ' be warned that although this exotic cuisine is largely cherished by the @entity6 , the takeaways produce food adapted to the @entity6 taste and so will not necessarily be as authentic as dishes eaten in those particular countries - slight more cooking oil and @entity82 food additive than perhaps should be used ! ' it also points out that our favourite curries are ' more @entity86 than actually @entity87			2
' legal minefield : the @entity8 staff are helpfully reminded not to bring firearms , stun guns , obscene material , drugs or dead animals through @entity6 customs ( file picture ) cultural differences : staff are warned the standard eating time for breakfast is 7.30am to 9am ( file picture ) there is also practical information on accommodation , parking , using the @entity106 and an explanation that appointments are unnecessary for @entity110 departments			2
and there is even a section on shopping in @entity27 and a series of paragraphs explaining how to navigate your way round @entity23			1
the guide explains @entity23 is : ' a popular and useful warehouse shop in which you can browse a thick catalogue of very wide ranging products			1
' a glossary of @entity125 terms also explains how ' flat ' means ' apartment ' while @entity6 public schools are actually private			0
surprisingly despite the unpopularity of president @entity132 's healthcare bill , the document praises the @entity133 saying it is ' generally considered to be of an excellent standard ' but it does point out that there are ' long waiting lists ' which mean some people have private healthcare on top of @entity133 provision			2
food for thought : the guide says that fish and chips is ' a national treat of fish , e.g. cod , fried in a crispy batter ' watering holes : when it comes to pubs readers are told they are ' much more than plain bar ' and to expect ' homely places full of historical character ( and characters ! ) ' stating the obvious : one section says @entity6 @entity72 takeaways are known as ' @entity72 ' and cover ' south east asian cuisine ' once @entity8 readers have swotted up on the @entity6 way of life and the peculiarities of the @entity125 language they are introduced to the ways of historic @entity27			1
the guide warns of high property and rent prices in @entity27 and quite rightly says that parking spaces are rare			1
employees who will be based in @entity27 are introduced to punting and are told about the historic colleges of the prestigious university			2
importantly , readers are giving tips on cycling in the bicycle capital including to use d - locks to ward of thieves			0
@entity183 's hospital in @entity27 : the guides explains that appointments are unnecessary in @entity110 hardly @entity186 : there is even a section on shopping in @entity27 and a series of paragraphs explaining how to navigate your way round @entity23 employees are also warned that restaurants are not 24/7 as in many parts of @entity8 and told the standard eating time for breakfast is 7.30am to 9am			1
@entity27 mayor @entity198 , who is originally from the @entity199 in the @entity8 , said : ' moving here was a very strange experience for me			1
' it took me a long time to make sense of it			0
you could not get coffee late at night			0
' @entity210 professor and director and curator of the @entity213 , who moved to the city 20 years ago , said there was an unavoidable language barrier between @entity6 and @entity8			0
she said : ' one thing i love here is the @entity125 cheeses - a good @entity221			0
you do n't get that back in @entity8			0
' it 's fair to say @entity8 and the @entity6 are on people only separated by a common language			0
' for example , ' quite ' in @entity8 means really or very , but here it can be seen as denigration			0
' @entity4 has spent a reported Â£ 40 million fitting out the new offices , the same cost of building it .			0
