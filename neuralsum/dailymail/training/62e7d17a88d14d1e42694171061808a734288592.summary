@entity1 officials face a race against time to dispose of a beached whale - before it explodes with potentially fatal consequences			1
the decaying 15 - ton carcass has become so bloated with gas there is a high chance it could burst , wildlife experts have warned			1
authorities are now desperately trying to work out the best way of getting rid of it - and may even blow it up with dynamite			1
video from last year showing a whale exploding in similar circumstances showed just how dangerous - and potentially fatal - it could be			1
the whale washed up on the beach at @entity33 , near @entity34 on the @entity36 coast in early november			1
@entity48 , project manager of the national reserve of @entity50 , said : ' because of the heat , gases form inside the cadaver â€“ hence , the bulging appearance of the whale			1
' they accumulate until they explode			2
' easy does it : marine biologist @entity60 approaches a 45ft whale with an extra-long sharp knife in this video from last year after it washed up n a beach in the @entity65 in the @entity66 mr @entity60 tried to cut open the sperm whale carcass which exploded in his face in november 2013 when an animal dies , bacteria inside the carcass produce methane as part of the decomposition process			1
if this is not let out of the body gradually it builds up , exploding at the first opportunity			1
whales are the most extreme because their huge size makes the consequences of a gas build - up so much greater			1
living toads in @entity84 , @entity85 , started spontaneously combusting in 2005			0
it was thought crows were picking out their livers , leaving a hole , so when the toads puffed themselves up as a defence mechanism , their whole bodies burst			0
and @entity94 funeral attendants hurriedly drilled a hole in the coffin of the overweight @entity98 king @entity97 to let out gases - after an apparent botched embalming job			1
the whale could be dragged out to sea and detonated using dynamite , he told daily newspaper @entity104 , according to @entity105			1
but he said boats may not be able to get close enough to tow it because of sand banks nearby			0
the other option would be to pop the carcass and cut it into pieces before loading it onto a van			0
last year , the dangers of exploding whale carcasses were made all - too clear when a marine biologist was captured on gruesome video trying to cut one open - which exploded all over him			1
the sperm whale was one of two which died last november after beaching in the @entity65 in the @entity66			2
the creatures died after becoming trapped in a narrow channel , and residents of the 50,000 - strong @entity127 community wanted to use the skeleton of one for a museum			2
so it fell to unlucky @entity60 , a marine biologist at the @entity131 of the @entity65 , to cut open the carcass yesterday			0
he had never cut open a whale before so he approached the pungent 45ft corpse gingerly			2
as soon as he began working , the gas trapped inside exploded , spewing tons of organs and guts into the air			2
the main part of the huge blast just missed him			0
organs : mr @entity60 stands apparently stunned as the whale 's insides fly into the air in front of him gruesome : by the time the worker on the @entity65 turned round to escape , it was too late he told @entity150 : ' the animal was more than two days old when we took it so we knew there would be some pressure on the inside , but nothing like what happened			2
' we could n't imagine it would happen like that so it was a little bit more of a surprise			0
' it was n't a shock			0
in the situation i was more worried about something worse happening or anyone getting hurt			0
' we were cutting along the dorsal part of the animal so when it exploded it did so in a very controlled way			0
' it was very loud , i suppose			0
it 's something everyone here is talking about			0

@entity178 at risk of bursting on @entity36 beach due to build - up of gas
roads and beach cordoned off to stop people approaching or touching it
video last year showed how dangerous exploding whale corpses can be
