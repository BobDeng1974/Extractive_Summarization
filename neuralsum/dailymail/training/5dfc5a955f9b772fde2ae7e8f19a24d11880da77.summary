vehicles carrying @entity3 aid to displaced families in @entity5 and @entity6 are being forced to pay huge bribes to @entity9 militants , it has been claimed			1
in yet another revenue stream for the terrorists , checkpoints have been set up on key roads where trucks carrying food and medical supplies are stopped and forced to pay to continue their journey			1
the bribes are reportedly disguised as vague ' transportation costs ' by those making the payments , in order not to raise attention to the fact huge sums of @entity3 money are helping to fund the day - to - day running of @entity28 ' so - called caliphate in the @entity30			1
claims that @entity28 is recouping vast sums of money from bribes paid by @entity3 aid convoys came from an aid coordinator who spoke to @entity47 on condition of anonymity			1
' the convoys have to be approved by @entity28 and you have to pay them : the bribes are disguised and itemized as transportation costs , ' he said , adding that the payments are made either by foreign or local non-governmental organizations , or by @entity59 or @entity5 transportation companies			1
particular blackspots for @entity28 checkpoints are the roads around the militants ' strongholds in @entity37 and @entity38 , as well as a number of major highways in eastern @entity5			2
the aid coordinator also raised concerns that not enough is being done to ensure the supplies themselves do not fall in the terrorists ' hands he claims quantities of @entity3 food and medicine have been used to help appease families living under @entity28 ' brutal oppression , with some also sold on the black market in eastern @entity5			1
checkpoints : @entity28 militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in @entity5 and @entity6 to pay to continue their journey unhindered a key element in @entity28 ' propaganda campaign is the phony representation that the terror group can operate as an independent state			1
however despite their undoubted wealth , the estimated 35,000 fighters in control of up to four million mainly reluctant citizens are unable to produce anything like the steady flow of food and medical aid it requires to function			2
as no nation will openly do business with the terror group , despite an estimated Â£ 2billion war chest largely raised from oil production and smuggling , the militants are forced to resort to stealing supplies from @entity3 convoys			0
it is claimed that , in order to allow the convoys to enter @entity5 and @entity6 , @entity28 insists on approving the staff list of transport companies			1
it also demands that each convoy has at least one militant assigned to oversee the operation and arrange prices with the group 's religious leaders			0
' we do n't have to wrangle with individual @entity28 field commanders once approval is given to get the convoy in , as the militants are highly hierarchical ... none of the fighters will dare touch it , ' an aid coordinator told the @entity47			2
an @entity123 journalist has been killed in a car crash in @entity59 just days after claiming she claimed the @entity59 intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of @entity128			0
@entity129 , who worked for @entity131 's state - owned @entity130 as @entity59 correspondent , died in the city of @entity134 after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a ' heavy vehicle '			0
@entity138 's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested , claiming @entity59 intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested @entity28 militants were being smuggled back and forth over the @entity5 border in the back of aid vehicles			1
tragic : @entity129 , who worked for @entity131 's state - owned @entity130 as @entity59 correspondent , died in the city of @entity134 after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a ' heavy vehicle ' @entity138 , an @entity123 citizen of @entity154 origin , had been working in @entity59 for @entity130 - the @entity131 state - owned television network			0
in a report published on the company 's website , it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of @entity134 in @entity164 when the ' suspicious ' accident took place			0
neither the ' heavy vehicle ' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident , @entity130 claimed , adding that her parents ' refused to believe ' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally			0
@entity130 's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by @entity59 newspaper @entity177 , however , who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as - yet - unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene			0
death : @entity129 's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested , claiming @entity59 intelligence agents had accused her of spying only last friday @entity138 was interviewed on camera by @entity130 about her fears of being arrested by @entity59 intelligence agencies			0
in the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of @entity9 terrorists being smuggled over the @entity59 - @entity5 in vehicles belonging to the @entity197 and other aid groups			2
@entity138 described herself as ' surprised ' at the accusation , ' because i have nothing to hide and i have never done anything aside my job			0
