' the guy who owns and bred him is a bit nervous that the quicker spring ground is not really his cup of tea			0
' so , although we have big novice hurdle aspirations in the spring , they would not be the be all and end all			0
we have one eye on chasing the following season			0

he needed it a bit and was flat - out all the way			0
