no workplace , coffee shop or even school playground is complete without them			0
but @entity5 ’s ubiquitous gadgets , the @entity6 and @entity7 , have been making headlines recently for some — literally — shocking reasons			1
this week , a father told how his daughter ’s @entity6 charger exploded in his hand giving him a massive electric shock			0
@entity16 , 34 , said he was thrown across the room and left with blackened fingers when he reached down to unplug the device at his mother ’s house in @entity22 , @entity23			1
he believes his eight - year - old daughter @entity24 would have been killed had she touched it			0
shocking : the @entity5 @entity6 and recharger plug , which exploded at the socket , burning @entity16 '' s fingers and sending him flying across the room it ’s the latest in a line of incidents where @entity7 and @entity6 chargers have been blamed for putting lives at risk			1
so are your @entity5 chargers really dangerous ? or is it all down to the cheaper imitation chargers which flood the market ? yes			1
the incident in @entity23 comes after two in @entity42 , leaving one person dead and another in a coma			1
@entity42 air stewardess @entity45 , 23 , was reportedly killed by an electric shock in july when she answered a call on her @entity7 5 while it was recharging			2
earlier this year in @entity50 , a woman claimed her @entity51 spontaneously melted , oozing acid that destroyed the handset			0
then in february this year , fire crews in @entity55 blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated @entity58 battery which had been placed on a mattress			0
in 2011 , two @entity51 on opposite sides of the world caught fire and self - combusted			0
the first happened on a plane over @entity64 and the second in @entity66 when its owner was awakened by the smoking device on his bedside table			0
lethal : @entity16 believes his eight - year - old daughter @entity24 could have been killed in the explosion it 's highly likely that some of the dangerous incidents have been the fault of chargers			2
indeed , miss @entity78 ’s death was blamed on an imitation charger			0
so why do people buy them ? it ’s simple — the price			0
you can get them for under a fiver from @entity88 sellers , for example , whereas the official one is at least £ 15			1
but it ’s a saving that could come at a high price			0
‘ there are plenty of reputable companies that make accessories for @entity5 products , and as long as you go with one of them , you should be fine , ’ says @entity93 , online editor at macworld.co.uk			1
‘ i ’d never buy an ‘ official @entity6 charger ’ from a bloke on the street and i ’d advise others not to do the same			2
’ there are over 600 million @entity5 devices including iphones and @entity110 being used around the world and only a handful of reported incidents			1
the chances are you ’re very safe			0
but counterfeit cheap chargers appear to raise the risks significantly			1
‘ any genuine products from a well - known manufacturer such as @entity5 are rigorously tested and should be safe , ’ says dr @entity118 , a senior member of the @entity119 and a reader in computer science at the @entity122			1
‘ but you may experience problems with non-proprietary products — those that may fit your @entity7 or @entity6 but come from a different company			0
‘ i can understand why people would buy cheaper chargers but a few years ago i had one that exploded so i would n’t go near one now			2
’ so big is the problem that @entity5 have decided to help customers tell the genuine articles from the fake — although , ironically , their detailed online guides to spotting the difference may well help counterfeiters imitate the visual design of @entity5 products more closely			1
for details about how to detect a genuine @entity5 charger see : www.apple.com/uk/power-adapters /			1
any item connected to mains could lead to a shock but this is exceptionally rare			0
‘ to tell people not to speak while a phone is charging is akin to telling people to disconnect a microwave before opening the door to remove food , ’ says dr @entity118			0
‘ if the report about the @entity42 lady being electrocuted when she answered her phone is accurate , then it is fair to say that the phone or charger was defective			2
the current flowing into a charging phone is typically not enough to kill a person			0
’ while it should be safe , you should n’t do this if you want your battery to last			0
most modern smartphones and tablets have a device that stops the charge from trickling out once it ’s full , but if you have too many apps open or your @entity174 is left on , a small amount of charge will leak out — even when it ’s plugged in			2
the result ? it will just keep on re-charging			0
‘ the problem with that is that batteries can only be recharged a finite number of times , ’ says dr @entity118			0
action : @entity5 says it is running a worldwide programme to replace fake chargers ‘ it varies from battery to battery and can be anything from 10,000 times to 40,000 times			1
that means that if it ’s plugged in overnight , your phone or tablet might lose , say , one per cent of its charge as it searches for @entity174 or one of the apps becomes active and then it will recharge itself			2
‘ that means your battery will recharge itself 30 or 40 times a night which will affect its lifespan			0
’ to combat this , dr @entity118 advises putting your phone / tablet on a socket that is controlled by a timer and only charging it for a few hours a night			2
you could even use the timer to switch it on and off a couple of times during the night			0
‘ i used to put mine on charge until about 5am and then it would switch off , ’ he says			2
if you ’re using the charger that came with the phone or tablet , it should n’t take as long as if you ’re using a non-proprietary model			0
a recent test by @entity223 found that an @entity6 4 took five hours and nine minutes to charge fully , but an incredible 19 hours and 13 minutes with an alien charger			1
victim : @entity45 , a 23 - year - old air stewrdess with @entity227 , who died when she picked up her phone as it was charging meanwhile , the @entity7 took two hours 16 minutes to charge with the @entity5 charger , but two hours 57 minutes with the alien charger			1
and ensure you have ten or 15 hours to spare if you ’re ever tempted to use your @entity7 charger to charge up your @entity6			1
phones have no problems drawing charge from tablets , but tablets take much longer to draw juice from phone chargers			1
in tests , the @entity6 took ten hours and five minutes to charge using the @entity7 charger			1
prompted by the @entity42 incident , @entity5 has now begun a worldwide programme that will run until october 18 to replace third - party and counterfeit usb chargers			1
‘ recent reports have suggested that some counterfeit and third - party adaptors may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ while not all third - party adaptors have an issue , we are announcing a @entity253 to enable customers to acquire properly designed adaptors			0
’ consumers with any concerns about their adapters should drop them off at an @entity5 store or an authorised service provider , @entity5 says , where they will be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way			1
they will replace it with a genuine adaptor for the reduced price of £ 8			2
more details of this scheme can be found at : @entity5 / uk .			2

cheap chargers go for £ 5 online compared with official £ 15
