by @entity0 published : 05:36 est , 14 january 2013 updated : 05:36 est , 14 january 2013 a team of amateur astronomers from around the world has discovered evidence for 42 alien planets , including a @entity8 - size world that could potentially be habitable , it was revealed today			1
the team , organised online via the planethunters website , analysed data from @entity13 's @entity12			1
an artist 's impression of of the view from a moon orbiting the planet @entity18			1
scientists says moons like the one depicted in the film @entity22 may be among the most common places to find alien life , moons like the one depicted in the film @entity22 may be among the most common places to find alien life , scientists believe			1
astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life - friendly ' habitable zones ' of stars			1
all are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to @entity8 or @entity37			0
while such planets would not themselves be suitable for @entity42 - like life , they could be circled by moons on which there are forests , oceans and living creatures , researchers now believe			1
@entity48 , the fictional moon in @entity22 , is just such a world			0
so far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9 % certainty			1
the rest still fall into the category of ' candidate ' planets while further evidence is collected			1
the confirmed planet , known as @entity18 , orbits a sun - like star in the constellation @entity63 several hundred light years away			0
astronomer dr @entity64 , from @entity65 , a member of the international team behind the discovery , said : ' there 's an obsession with finding @entity42 - like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as @entity18 b is far stranger			1
' @entity8 has several large water - rich moons			1
imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the @entity42 is			0
' if such a planet had @entity42 - size moons , we 'd see not @entity81 and @entity82 but worlds with rivers , lakes and all sorts of habitats : a surprising scenario that might just be common			2
@entity22 was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought			0
' it may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around @entity8 and @entity37 - size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system			1
' members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers			0
the @entity107 project invites ' citizen scientists ' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell - tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars			2
follow - up work with the @entity116 in @entity117 provided the proof that @entity18 b is almost certainly a genuine planet			0
more than 40 volunteers are credited in a paper on the research published online by the @entity124			2
one , retired police office @entity125 , 71 , from @entity126 near @entity127 , said : ' it is difficult to put into words , the pleasure , wonderment and perhaps even pride that i have in some small way been able to assist in the discovery of a planet			0
' another , electronics engineer @entity137 from @entity138 , said : ' now when people ask me what i achieved last year i can say i have helped discover a possible new planet around a distant star			0
how cool is that ? ' planet hunters lead scientist professor @entity145 , from @entity146 in the @entity147 , said : ' we are seeing the emergence of a new era in the @entity107 project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars			1
' now , the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet ; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds			2
' @entity22 featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like @entity48 could be the best place to look for alien life before the latest finds , 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones			2
also known as the ' @entity171 ' , this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but " just right " to permit liquid surface water			0
dr @entity174 , another @entity107 scientist from @entity146 , said : ' we can speculate that @entity18 might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life			0
' i ca n't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments			2
' that could happen any day now			0

online team analysed data from @entity13 's @entity12 *telescope*
amateur planethunters discovered 15 of the new planets that could have habitable moons
