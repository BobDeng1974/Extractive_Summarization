details are revealed today in the new @entity25 annual report into motoring			1
motorists are being fleeced by some the highest pump prices in @entity10 , a report suggests the @entity25 said even after exchange - rate discrepancies were stripped out , diesel on the @entity6 was still cheaper than @entity2 in 19 of the 22 countries surveyed : ‘ it does smack of a rip - off			1
’ chastened @entity2 supermarkets yesterday responded to the damning findings and angry criticism from motoring groups such as the @entity38 by cutting up to 2p off the cost of a litre of diesel – though critics said much more was needed			1
drivers motoring through @entity12 will pay a staggering 29p a litre less for their diesel than in @entity2 , the new @entity25 report reveals			1
on diesel prices @entity2 finishes in a dismal 20th place out of 22 @entity10 countries surveyed with an average price of £ 1.37 a litre , compared to just 94p in cheapest @entity52 – a difference of 43p a litre - and 99p in runner up @entity55 , £ 1.08 in fourth place @entity12 and £ 1.11 in sixth place @entity58			1
that means for a family driving 1,000 miles – 500 each way – a drive through @entity12 would be £ 44.26 less than for the same journey in the @entity2 , with @entity12 bill coming to £ 163.17 compared to £ 207.42 in @entity2			0
for fill - ups in cheapest @entity52 the price difference would be £ 65.56			0

’ the price gap between fuels is also acute			0
on the @entity6 diesel is up to 27p a litre cheaper than unleaded petrol while in @entity2 it costs 6p more than four - star			0
motoring groups say garages are ¿ profiteering ¿ by dragging their feet and failing to pass on the benefits of falling wholesale prices of up to 6p a litre for diesel on the bright side , the report says lower pump prices on the continent generally and a stronger pound against the @entity96 will give @entity2 drivers a bumper summer bonus when motoring across @entity10 – especially neighbouring @entity12			1
but experts advise @entity101 drivers to fill - up on foreign soil rather than pay exorbitant prices in @entity2			0
the post office report notes : ‘ lower prices in @entity10 petrol stations mean that @entity2 tourists on @entity111 motoring holidays can expect their cars to drive more miles for less cash this year			1
fuelled by the strong pound , pump prices have fallen in 20 of 22 countries surveyed			0
’ biggest price falls have been in @entity12 , with petrol down 15per cent and diesel dipping 18percent compared with last year , says the @entity25 report			2
@entity58 's prices have also fallen - with petrol down 4.8per cent and diesel down 4.3per cent			0
the @entity25 report notes : ‘ the biggest fall in the cost of unleaded petrol and diesel fuel has been in @entity12 , where the litre price is down 23p for unleaded and 24p for diesel			1
this year ’s price fall means diesel drivers will pay 29p a litre less in @entity12 than in the @entity2			0
’ it adds : ‘ a combination of cheaper fuel and the strong pound means @entity2 tourists can expect to pay 15 per cent less for unleaded petrol ( £ 1.26 ) and 18 per cent less for diesel ( £ 1.08 ) at @entity12 pumps			0
‘ this means that 1,000 miles of motoring through @entity12 will cost £ 45 less than last year in a car using unleaded petrol ( £ 191 ) and £ 47 less for diesel drivers ( £ 163 )			0
‘ details are revealed today in the new @entity25 annual report into motoring prices are also down this year in two other @entity10 destinations popular with @entity2 holiday motorists – @entity58 and @entity149			1
in @entity58 , where four out of ten ( 38 per cent ) said they have driven , pump prices are down 6p a litre for unleaded ( £ 1.18 ) and 5p for diesel fuel ( £ 1.11 )			2
a third of motorists said they had driven in @entity149 , where a litre of unleaded petrol is 13p now cheaper than last year ( £ 1.28 )			0
overall , the report noted : ‘ pump prices have fallen by up to 24p per litre year - on - year in @entity10 motoring holiday destinations			1
’ @entity161 ( £ 1.14 a litre ) , @entity163 ( £ 1.15 ) and @entity164 ( £ 1.17 ) also offer comparatively cheap petrol , while @entity166 ( £ 1.07 a litre ) , @entity12 ( £ 1.08 ) and @entity161 ( £ 1.08 ) are among the best - buy countries for diesel			0
but @entity2 motorists looking for the best fuel deals would do well to avoid @entity172 which has the dearest petrol ( £ 1.65 a litre ) and the most - expensive diesel ( £ 1.50 )			2
other countries where fuel costs are high include @entity178 , where petrol is £ 1.55 a litre , and @entity181 where it costs £ 1.51			0
@entity183 of @entity25 urged drivers to do their homework before traveling : ‘ in @entity12 , especially , it will pay drivers crossing to @entity12 ports to fill up when they reach foreign soil because of the big drop in fuel prices there			2
’ @entity38 fuel spokesman @entity191 said @entity2 garages were dragging their feet and that their actions smacked of profiteering : ‘ fuel retailers must reduce the price of diesel at the pumps as the wholesale cost is now almost the same as petrol - yet average forecourt prices are still 6p a litre more expensive			1
‘ @entity206 , fair fuel pricing is vital for the economy and to maintain the trust of motorists			0
while two thirds of @entity2 ’s 29million cars run on petrol we use twice as much diesel , around 26billion litres a year			0
’ ahead of the damning @entity25 report , @entity215 cut up to 2p a litre off its diesel with a price cap of 131.7p a litre			1
petrol prices remain unchanged at 127.7p a litre			0
