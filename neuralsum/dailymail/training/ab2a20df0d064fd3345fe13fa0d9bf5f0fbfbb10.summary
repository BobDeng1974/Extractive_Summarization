by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 10:05 est , 3 september 2012 tragic accident : lance corporal @entity2 was killed in @entity3 when they mistakenly believed he and others were the enemy a @entity7 soldier was killed in @entity3 after being shot by a @entity10 @entity9 helicopter which wrongly identified his base as an enemy stronghold in a ' tragic accident ' , an inquest heard			1
lance corporal @entity2 , 23 , of @entity15 , died from head injuries at @entity17 , in @entity18 , @entity19 , in december 2009			1
the base had come under attack from insurgents and the platoon based there were busy fighting them off when air support was called in , @entity21 coroner @entity20 said			1
a drone fitted with a camera and two @entity31 flew to the patrol base , which was a compound with mud walls , bought from a local owner some weeks before and was not on official maps			1
@entity7 troops on the ground , who by this stage had won a firefight against their attackers , were incorrectly identified as the enemy and were hit by 30mm chain gun rounds			1
mr @entity20 , the @entity21 coroner , said 200 rounds were fired before the mistake was spotted , leaving 11 injured on the ground			1
@entity47 , a married former drayman , received emergency treatment but died from his injuries the next day			1
captain @entity51 , commanding @entity47 's platoon , said that night insurgents set off a large bomb and launched an attack with small arms fire			2
he told the inquest his men managed to repel the attackers			1
' we were pretty much winning the firefight which means we pushed them back to a safe distance and hopefully they were going to move off into the night , ' he said			2
then the base came under heavy attack from what he later realised were @entity31			1
' it was like nothing i have ever experienced before and i tried to establish what it could be , ' he said			2
at first he believed the explosions and shrapnel were caused by enemy rocket - propelled grenades fired from 800m and exploding in the air above them			1
he also wondered if the enemy had breached the compound defences in the dark			2
he did not know how long the @entity9 attack lasted or how many passes the helicopters made			2
men were injured , a communication mast destroyed and the picture became confused as he was unaware any @entity31 were in the area			1
he said at around the same time , his men and staff at @entity90 realised the @entity10 attack helicopters were to blame			2
meanwhile , the enemy , who had been moving away , saw what happened and came back to renew the assault and got to within 30m of the base			1
a 500lb bomb was dropped on a compound the insurgents were using to launch fire on @entity100 , and their raid ended			2
asked by @entity103 , the soldier 's brother , if the @entity9 's presence was needed , captain @entity51 replied : ' we could have won the firefight ... as we were , we were ok			2
' heartbroken : mourners dressed in @entity21 football strips paid their last respects to @entity111 when his body arrived at @entity113 picture of misery : the coffins of three dead @entity7 soldiers , including @entity111 , were greeted by hundreds of mourners as their hearses went through @entity113 in 2009 when his body was brought back to @entity7 , hundreds of mourners turned out on the streets of @entity113 , @entity120 , to pay their respects			1
a group of the father - of - one 's grief - stricken relatives and friends - including his wife @entity126 - made the long journey from the @entity128 to honour the fallen hero			0
some wore the red - and - white stripes of @entity47 's beloved home town @entity132 @entity21 and clutched @entity134 emblazoned with his name			0
mr @entity20 said the mistaken view that the @entity7 base was an insurgents â€™ compound was shared with key personnel			1
this was despite the patrol base , 3km from @entity143 , having a flagpole , a washing line , defensive constructions and personnel who were not dressed like the enemy , mr @entity20 said			1
he was summarising the evidence he expected to hear during the week - long inquest			1
statements have been given from the @entity10 pilots and co-pilots which will be read later			0
retired lieutenant colonel @entity154 , who watched live pictures of the attack , said it was a ' tragic incident '			1
in his opening statement , mr @entity20 said throughout the incident the @entity10 @entity9 helicopter crews were not informed , nor did they ask for the exact location of @entity17			0
he said : ' as a consequence , they were unaware that the compound they were observing and in which they believed they had positively identified insurgents was , in fact @entity169			0
' he described how , with ' total disorientation ' now in place , the @entity31 were authorised to engage			1
' fused by the overwhelming belief that @entity17 was at risk of being overrun , the subsequent reactions and actions to these events created a devastating cumulative effect ' , he said			0
mr @entity20 said that due to the involvement of the @entity10 @entity9 helicopters , the number of personnel and the different locations , the sequence of events that unfolded was highly complex			0
fatal : an @entity9 helicopter , like this one , opened fire and killed the tragic soldier as a result , he said he would consider all that was visible in the context of a base that was not on the map			1
he also stated he would take into consideration the ' cumulative human factor elements in this tragic incident ' as well as any lessons learnt			1
in his evidence , lt col @entity154 said the base at @entity100 was one of the hardest for the army to defend			2
' by the end of the tour , @entity205 still remained the trickiest as we had limited vehicle access ' , he said			0
' there was very rudimentary defences , such as three layers of barbed wire			0
' there was also no printed mapping that had it marked on it			0
' he said that on the camera picture he was watching of the attack it was impossible to identify those on screen			2
he said : ' we could see black blobs running around but its just a blob			0
' there 's no way at that distance of identifying the people			0
' i could see muzzle flashes and projectiles being launched but i was the victim of my own assumptions			0
' he said when it dawned on them what had happened the command was given to ' check fire '			0
' the operations room was very busy and it was a pretty frenetic environment ' , he said			0
he said six deaths had already occurred that week and there was a general nervousness about @entity17			0
concluding his evidence , he expressed his regret at what happened			0
he said : ' i want to record my considerable amount of regret and there 's not one of us that can not think of something we might have done differently			0
' lt col @entity154 said @entity17 was set up to halt activity in what had become a ' no - go area ' known as the @entity258			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
