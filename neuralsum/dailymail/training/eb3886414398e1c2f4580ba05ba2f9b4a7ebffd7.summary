@entity1 ’s penchant for heated toilets has resulted in an @entity4 invasion of deadly redback spiders			1
an @entity4 song that warns people to ‘ beware of the redback spider on the toilet seat at night ’ could n't be more true than in @entity1 after large numbers of the potentially fatal insect have been found in a @entity13 suburb			1
the dangerous long - legged spider with a distinctive red body is a native of @entity4 , but somehow has found its way to @entity1 , where it lurks in dark corners			1
the long - legged spider is a native of @entity4 , but has found its way to @entity1 and is believed to have survived their harsh winters thanks to heat spread into bathroom walls from the toilet seats experts had initially believed the tropical spider could never survive the bitingly - cold @entity1 winters - but it is now thought that the heated toilets many @entity1 have in their homes have provided a perfect winter hideaway			1
while the insects have n’t literally slept the winter away under @entity1 toilet seats , the warmth spread from them into bathroom walls has provided comfort from the cold			1
now , the @entity40 reports , @entity4 experts have warned that @entity1 ’s medical system is not ready for an invasion of the potentially deadly spider because limited supplies of anti-venom are available to authorities			2
about a dozen of the venomous insects have been found in the @entity13 residential district of @entity51 , terrifying parents			1
about a dozen of the venomous insects have been found in the @entity13 residential district of @entity51 , terrifying parents although the insects were quickly rounded up and exterminated , government official @entity53 said local authorities would not be able to stop them from moving into other areas			1
‘ it ’s unthinkable that they only exist in @entity51 , so they ’ll probably be found in many other areas of @entity13 from now on , ’ he said			2
at @entity1 ’s @entity62 , dr @entity61 admitted that the @entity1 medical system was not prepared for the spider ’s spread			2
‘ the medical system is behind , ’ he told the @entity4 broadcaster			0
‘ they have anti-venom in @entity70 and @entity71 but other provinces do n’t have supplies			0
so it ’s a serious issue and has n’t been addressed			0
’ redbacks are potentially fatal for small children , a fact @entity4 are taught at a young age			1
as @entity1 slowly becomes aware of the dangers of the bright - red spider , a school education programme has started in schools to ensure that children do n’t make the fatal mistake of picking them up			2
the programme warns youngsters that if they see small spiders ‘ with a pretty red back , do n’t touch them			0
’ it was in 1995 that the spider was first detected in @entity1 , in the city of @entity70 , possibly arriving on a ship carrying fruit or wooden products from @entity4			2
since then , they have spread to other parts of the country so that their numbers are estimated to be in the many thousands			0
they do not have any natural enemies , they have ample food - and they have those warm toilets and other efficient heating systems to see them through the winter			0
the redbacks are reported to have bitten about 100 people in @entity1			0
but so far there have been no fatalities			0
but experts fear that with their numbers growing - and relatively little anti-venom available - the risks of a fatality are increasing .			0
