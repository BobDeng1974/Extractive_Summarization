by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:22 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:02 est , 18 december 2013 it ’s a familiar feeling of panic – that moment you realise you ’ve spilt the entire contents of your coffee cup all over computer			0
right now in offices up and down the country , thousands of people are holding their heads in horror and scrabbling for anything dry to limit the damage			0
now , one inventor from @entity18 has come up with a remarkably simple solution to put an end to the hazards of drinking while working			0
a new cup holder has been invented to stop office workers spilling drinks on their keyboards			2
the special device looks like something that might be found in a car and clamps on to the side of a desk to hold a drink the contraption , named the @entity34 , was invented by @entity35 after some of his friends broke their computers or burned themselves when spilling their drinks			1
the £ 30 gadget can hold any size drinks from small plastic cups all the way up to a large takeaway container , pint glass , and a thermos			1
because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved , it makes it almost impossible to knock over			1
the contraption , named the @entity34 , was invented by @entity35 after some of his friends broke their computers or burned themselves when spilling their drinks the @entity34 cupholder is made of a solid aluminum and clamps to tables , desks and trays up to 1.5 inches in thickness			1
the £ 30 device has the ability to support a variety of containers and mugs up to three inches in diameter			1
it can also support paper and plastic cups , thermos bottles and even the odd cup you get on airplanes			1
because the centre of gravity of the beverage has been moved - up to the container 's rim - it makes it almost impossible to knock over			1
mr @entity35 drew up a series of designs and built a prototype before putting it on a crowd funding website @entity81 to raise money for the manufacturing process			0
he aimed to raise £ 1,500 but was given a total of £ 7,000 and he is now manufacturing the handy device			2
the 52 - year - old said : ‘ i know people who have burned themselves and fried their computers when they 've knocked over a drink			2
‘ i started thinking about the problem as we are more frequently working alongside a tall drink whether at home , work , a classroom , on the road or in a cafe or hotel			0
‘ i collected and took the measurements of every cup i could get from cafes and sketched out different approaches before making several prototypes and then a final design			0
mr @entity35 drew up a series of designs and built a prototype before putting it on a crowd funding website @entity81 to raise money for the manufacturing process mr their said @entity113 will hold up to 900 ml as well as most thermoses and porcelain cups up to 3 inches in diameter			1
‘ it is ideal for everyone who works with a computer or other electronic device who does n't want to spend hundreds replacing it , ’ he said			0
