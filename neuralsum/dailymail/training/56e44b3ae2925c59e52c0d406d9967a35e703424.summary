by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 16 september 2012 updated : 05:42 est , 17 september 2012 lawyers acting on behalf of families of those killed in the @entity5 disaster will today write to the attorney general demanding that new inquests be held in @entity8			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) met at @entity10 yesterday to discuss the next step in its campaign for justice for the 96 victims of the 1989 disaster			1
high - profile lawyers for the campaign , @entity16 and @entity17 , appeared via an internet videolink			2
disaster : an injured fan is carried on a stretcher during the tragedy at @entity5 in 1989			1
families of the victims have demanded fresh inquests for their loved ones the @entity9 said it had instructed its lawyers to send letters out to ' relevant parties ' , including the attorney general and the @entity33 , to ' ensure that the machinery of the justice system is put into motion and the families receive a fair hearing '			1
following the three - and - a - half hour meeting , @entity39 and @entity40 , chairwoman of the @entity9 , who lost her son @entity41 , 18 , in the tragedy , gave a statement to the media in which they expressed their desire for the inquest verdicts to be overturned and new inquests to be held in @entity8			1
mr @entity39 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , who lost daughters @entity52 , 15 , and @entity53 , 19 , in the disaster , said : ' this goes beyond @entity5			2
' what was exposed on wednesday was a disgrace to the nation , not just the families ... this goes across society and it ’s important for society at large not to let this rest			0
' determined : @entity39 , who lost two daughters in the disaster , said it was ' important for society at large not to let this rest ' the statement on behalf of the @entity9 , reads : ' the findings of the @entity72 have finally vindicated the families in their 23 - year struggle to establish the truth			1
' however , after truth must come justice			0
we have spoken today to our lawyers and taken initial advice			0
' as the families have always believed and insisted , it was the actions and inaction of those in authority that caused the deaths at @entity5 on april 15 , 1989			1
' the fans did not contribute to the tragedy			2
any blame previously laid at their door has been shown to be part of a despicable conspiracy by those in authority to tarnish the reputations of the dead , the survivors of the disaster and the people of @entity8			1
' this conspiracy has been revealed for what it is ; a bid to avoid accountability			0
' those responsible can avoid accountability no longer			0
' the @entity9 says there are now three avenues which it will ' rigorously follow ' in the search for justice : new inquests to be held in @entity8 and not @entity112 ; a ' full and immediate ' investigation into criminal prosecutions to be brought against those responsible ; and , where appropriate , families will apply for civil proceedings to be re-opened where they may have been dismissed or settled ' on a false basis '			1
the damning @entity72 report revealed a cover - up took place to shift the blame on to the victims and that 41 of the 96 lives lost at @entity128 ’s stadium could have been saved			2
the panel found that 164 police statements were altered , 116 of them to remove or alter ' unfavourable ' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster			2
reviews have been ordered by police authorities in @entity50 into the actions of sir @entity139 , @entity140 ’s current chief constable , who was an off - duty inspector with the @entity143 force when he attended the game in 1989 , and was involved in an internal inquiry held by the force in its aftermath			1
' double standards ' : the average compensation payout for police officers traumatised by the disaster was £ 93,000 - 30 times the statutory level of compensation received by parents whose children were crushed @entity156 , which also conducted an investigation into the disaster , will also carry out a review			1
@entity160 , which still employs 195 officers who were on duty at the ground on the day of the tragedy , said the force would refer itself to the @entity166			2
chief constable @entity167 said @entity160 would consider asking the @entity166 whether those involved in the @entity5 tragedy should face manslaughter investigations			0
meanwhile , @entity171 , which represents rank - and - file officers , has apparently defended its former secretary , @entity173 , who was named by the panel as having briefed the media that fans were drunken and violent as the disaster unfolded			1
mr @entity173 told a federation meeting in april 1989 that he had been given a ' free hand ' to push the police ’s version of events , and spoke of his ' pride ' at the media briefings he had given			1
he has refused to apologise and , although he retired from @entity160 in the late 1990s , he still works at the force 's headquarters as chief executive of the @entity188			0
the federation 's current chairman , @entity189 , said : ' we are not going to comment on anything our predecessors did			0
' we co-operated with the panel and allowed our minutes to be published - and that was with the co-operation of @entity173			0
remembered : the names of all the 96 @entity5 victims are displayed at @entity200 's place in @entity8 city centre following the publication of the panel 's report ' just because the report has made those comments does not mean that he has done anything wrong			2
that is for an investigation and court of law to decide			0
' responding to suggestions that mr @entity173 ’s criticism of the victims had been immoral , mr @entity189 said : ' we represent officers ’ views			0
' if officers told me something that was contrary to what was happening in the @entity223 at the time , then i might want to put that view across			0
' it emerged yesterday that police officers who claimed trauma after @entity5 were given more than £ 90,000 in compensation on average , while families of children killed in the tragedy typically received only £ 3,500			1
sixteen officers received payments totalling £ 1.5million in the aftermath of the event			1
the average payout for officers was £ 93,000 - 30 times the statutory level of compensation received by parents whose children were among the 96 @entity8 supporters crushed to death at the football stadium in @entity112 in 1989			1
some of the bereaved claim they received as little as £ 1,000			2
the shocking imbalance - revealed in papers published this week by the panel - has caused more upset to families who waited 23 years for justice after details of the disaster were covered up by police			1
mr @entity39 said he received a fraction of the amount received by some of the police officers who were on duty on the day of the disaster			1
he told the @entity262 : ' many who lost family members have received nothing			0
yet we are seeing large amounts awarded to people who perhaps should n't have taken jobs in the first place			0
' it should be fair and equitable for all			0
' findings : @entity72 members ( from left to right ) @entity277 , @entity278 the right reverend @entity279 and professor @entity280 present their report mrs @entity40 said she received only £ 1,200			2
' there are people who think we got millions , ' she said			0
' that could n't be further from the truth			0
' the panel 's report stated : ' in cases that concerned the death of children , their parents received no more than the statutory bereavement allowance of £ 3,500 and funeral expenses			1
' cases that concerned the death of adults survived by dependants resulted in higher payments			0
' compensation for those who endured physical or psychological injury was assessed on the nature and extent of the injury , resulting loss of earnings or any ongoing medical costs			0
' the panel found that compensation claims from @entity160 ( @entity160 ) officers ' caused considerable tension within the force '			2
it states : ' senior officers viewed the claims with " great concern " and junior officers felt " immense pressure " from the force to withdraw them			0
' the report continues : ' £ 1.5million was ultimately paid out by @entity160 to 16 officers			1
' the costs were met from the force 's employers ' insurance cover			0
' a spokesman for @entity160 said : ' compensation tariffs for personal injury or conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder are defined by law			0
' the payments received by officers , victims and families of victims following the @entity5 were not determined by @entity160			1

traumatised officers got 30 times more in compensation on average than parents whose children died in the tragedy
sixteen police officers received compensation totalling £ 1.5million in the aftermath of the disaster
parents whose children were killed received £ 3,500 plus funeral expenses
