while most little girls love pink , pink was my least favourite colour growing up because it reminded me of the colour of my face — and still does			1
for as long as i can remember i have consistently blushed bright pink at the slightest provocation			1
in fact , to say that i am easily embarrassed is something of an understatement			1
even now — as a grown woman of 62 — i only have to get slightly anxious to flush a bright shade of fuchsia			1
if anyone makes a flattering remark , i blush ; if they make an unflattering one , i blush , and if i do something silly , of course , i blush			2
according to a recent study , we embarrass ourselves as many as seven times per week and women feel embarrassed three times more often than men			1
but seven times per week does n’t sound that often to me — i blush profusely at least once a day			2
on tuesday , i managed to clock up two embarrassing moments before lunch			2
in the morning i spent five minutes searching for my glasses			2
‘ i just do n’t know where they ’ve got to , ’ i moaned , only to have my partner point out that not only was i wearing them but i had another pair perched on my head ! cue redness			2
while most little girls love pink , pink was @entity22 's least favourite colour growing up because it reminded her of the colour of my face then in my local cafe , i bumped into an old flame i had n’t seen since school			1
despite me having unwashed hair and no make - up , he recognised me and announced cheerily : ‘ i was hopelessly in love with you when i was 14			0
’ my hand instantly flew up to cover the pinky - hue i could feel spreading across my cheeks			0
most people eventually stop going red when they get older , mainly because their confidence grows and they learn how to deal with embarrassing situations better			1
for those of us who continue to be afflicted , blushing in itself remains a lifelong embarrassment			1
according to clinical psychologist professor @entity68 , author of coping successfully with @entity69 , we get embarrassed because of a sense of either actual or impending shame , as well as a fear of unwarranted attention			1
‘ it kicks off an immediate physical reaction with a heightened state of arousal or adrenaline rush , ’ he explains			0
‘ you ’re not in control of this physical response and you may turn red as a result			0
other responses can include a dry mouth and racing heart			0
’ not everyone who feels embarrassment blushes , but chronic blushers sometimes become so fearful of blushing that they begin to lead a hermit - like existence , avoiding social situations entirely			1
although the survey suggests women feel embarrassed three times as often as men , professor @entity94 , author of coping with @entity95 , thinks it would be wrong to conclude that women suffer embarrassment more than men			1
‘ women tend to score higher than men on most levels of anxiety , ’ he says			0
‘ but this could be because women are more willing to admit they have negative feelings and find it easier to talk about their problems than men do			0
’ just why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned ( stock picture ) just why some people are more easily embarrassed than others may be partly genetic and partly learned			1
‘ if your parents are shy you may inherit that tendency , or perhaps you just pick up on their way of behaving , ’ says professor @entity68			0
certainly , my own mother was especially timid , while my dad was an outgoing charmer			0
when i look at old photos of my mother she ’s always posing with her head slightly at an angle and eyes slightly away from the direct gaze of the camera , as if mildly embarrassed			1
rather like the pose princess @entity135 struck in early pictures			0
an easily embarrassed child , it seems , can turn even a positive situation into a negative			1
professor @entity68 gives the example of a bright student who knows the answer to a question asked by a teacher in class but wo n’t put up his or her hand because then everyone else will look at them			1
a blush does n’t just show on your face — your stomach lining also turns red that ’s exactly why i kept schtum throughout my childhood and hated being picked out for special attention			0
i was worried i would get teased for being the clever one			0
in the same way , an easily embarrassed adult might be enjoying their birthday party only to feel horribly exposed when everyone sings @entity163			1
i enjoy celebrating my birthday but singing and speeches are strictly forbidden			0
not everyone who is shy needs professional help , but if embarrassment is inhibiting you from getting on with your life — from forming relationships , progressing in your career or simply from going out and having fun — help is available			0
according to professor @entity68 , modern psychological methods for dealing with social anxiety and embarrassment offer some of the most successful and rapid treatments of all			0
@entity22 often uses a green - tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness , but would only consider surgery if blushing was preventing her from getting on with her life a few sessions of @entity185 ( @entity185 ) , a therapy based on the idea that unhelpful and unrealistic thinking leads to negative behaviour , can give a big confidence boost — and blushing the boot			1
there ’s also hope in the form of an operation , endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy , which destroys the nerve responsible for facial blushing			2
some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the @entity200 , with a 90 per cent success rate			1
but one of the main risks is compensatory excess sweating , which can be as difficult to deal with as the initial problem			0
some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the @entity200 ( stock picture ) so how do you overcome your propensity to turn pink if you do n’t want to resort to surgery ? while i often use a green - tinged face cream under foundation to counteract redness , i ’d only consider surgery if blushing was preventing me from getting on with my life			1
professor @entity68 says the secret is to force yourself to cope in embarrassing situations and that ’s how i ’ve managed to get by			0
so i accept invitations to public - speaking engagements and am interviewed on radio and tv — even though i really do n’t want to			0
for those of us who despair of our constant blushing , there is some comfort to be gained from recent research that proves embarrassment can be a good thing			2
studies from the @entity237 , have shown that people who display embarrassment when describing embarrassing moments are regarded as more co-operative and trustworthy than those who show pride			2
professor @entity94 says : ‘ blushing shows you have a degree of humility , and that can be attractive			2
that perhaps explains why no woman ’s make - up is ever complete without a dab of blusher to give her a slight pink glow			2
’ i ’ve lived with my blushing for so long now that i ’ve almost come to accept it			1
i know that when my partner grabs me for a kiss in the park , i will blush and pull away , even though i ’m thrilled			0
that when i am about to introduce someone and have forgotten their name — which happens all the time — i will blush like an awkward teenager			0
and that when i walk through the nothing to declare corridor in customs , i will blush , even though i really do have nothing to declare			0
other than my blushing that is			2

some 200 operations to cure blushing are done every year on the @entity200
for as long as @entity22 can remember she has blushed bright pink
why some people are more easily embarrassed may be genetic and learned
