by @entity0 a crazed father who stabbed his partner and six - year - old son to death has sparked outrage after launching a bid to inherit his victims ’ estate from behind bars			1
@entity10 , 35 , was detained indefinitely in a secure mental health unit last year after going on a bloody rampage , knifing his son @entity16 25 times and his partner @entity15 32 times at their home			1
the father of one stabbed @entity19 before turning the knife on his terrified son after he awoke to hear his mother screaming and ran into his parents ’ bedroom			2
killer @entity10 has launched a bid to inherit the £ 200,000 estate of his victims , partner @entity15 ( left ) and their son @entity16 but now the deranged killer is trying to get his hands on his victim ’s £ 200,000 estate using a legal loophole reserved for victims of domestic violence			1
yesterday miss @entity15 ’s grieving family said they were ‘ sickened ’ after the paranoid schizophrenic lodged papers at the @entity39 demanding access to the £ 150,000 semi-detached home he shared with his 40 - year - old partner in @entity44 , @entity45 , his son ’s £ 30,000 trust fund , and £ 16,000 in joint bank accounts			1
to add further insult , he is demanding that his victim ’s aunts , uncles and cousins , who stand to inherit the estate , fit the bill for his legal costs			1
if he is successful , the test case could set a precedent for other killers to make claims on the grounds that their mental health was impaired at the time			1
yesterday miss @entity15 ’s distraught family issued a statement saying : ‘ we were stunned when we found out he was taking legal action to try to claim the inheritance			1
‘ he robbed them of their lives , their futures , and now he wants to take their money			0
this is a matter of justice			0
‘ this has caused a great deal of distress to us			0
‘ the thought that @entity15 ’s killer can profit from his crime is too appalling for words			1
‘ we ca n’t afford to be dragged into a lengthy legal fight			0
’ @entity10 launched a frenzied attack on his family , stabbing six - year - old @entity16 ( pictured with his mother ) 25 times before turning the knife on @entity19 , stabbing her 32 times miss @entity15 ’s relatives , who do not want to be named , have been forced to raid savings to fight the killer ’s case			1
the law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter can not inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes			0
but under the @entity106 of 1982 , there is clause allowing the rules to be bent if ‘ the justice of the case requires the effect of the rule to be so modified in that case ’ due to exceptional circumstances in the conduct of the offender or deceased			0
for example , if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the hands of her partner suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her partner without intending to , they may still be able to inherit his estate on his death			1
@entity10 , who is currently being held at a secure hospital in @entity127 , lodged a claim at @entity129 just three months after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility last september			1
the landscape gardener , who had been due to visit a psychiatrist on the day of the double killing on april 9 last year , had been charged with murder			2
but the plea to the lesser manslaughter charges were accepted following psychiatric reports , which led to the killer being transferred from @entity127 prison to the @entity143 facility near the city			0
@entity145 heard that @entity10 crept downstairs in the middle of the night to grab two kitchen knives which he stashed under the bed			2
he stabbed his sleeping partner a number of times , but she managed to get out of bed and run downstairs for help when their six - year - old son appeared in the doorway			1
@entity158 was detained indefinitely at the @entity160 mental health facility in @entity127 , @entity45 @entity10 stabbed him three times before pursuing miss @entity15 and knifing her in a frenzy			1
when he returned upstairs to find his son still breathing , he plunged the knife three inches into his neck and took him back to his bedroom , laying his arms across his chest , before turning the knife on himself in a botched suicide attempt			0
@entity10 's mother @entity171 discovered the bodies minutes later when she peered through the letter box after @entity16 failed to arrive at day care that morning			1
she called police after seeing miss @entity15 's body lying in the hallway and @entity10 , lying wounded at the bottom of the stairs			1
when he was interviewed by detectives , @entity10 claimed he wanted the three of them to be ' together in death '			2
he said , ‘ i feel awful , terrible , i wish i could turn the clock back			0
i have done wrong , i love my boy and my girl			0
' i did n’t mean to			0
i killed them but i do n’t know why i did it			0
' days earlier , @entity10 had complained of hearing voices and told his girlfriend , who worked part - time in a @entity194 store , he was concerned that people thought he was gay			2
mr @entity196 ordered him to remain in hospital handing him an ‘ unlimited ’ restriction order , which means he will only be released on the consent of the secretary of state			0
but @entity10 has managed to contact lawyers who lodged a claim arguing that because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried out the attack he is still entitled to the assets and house bought by @entity19 using money she inherited from her family because he was the beneficiary of her will			1
his claim submitted by law firm , @entity212 , states : ‘ in light of the claimant having suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning and with reference to the psychiatric evidence provided in criminal proceedings in relation to the offence , the claimant seeks a modification of the forfeiture rules … allowing him to inherit the estate of the @entity226 and the @entity227			2
’ he is seeking to fund his legal battle through monies from the estate and has launched a claim for ‘ costs ’ from his victims ’ heartbroken relatives , who learnt of the action just days before @entity237 last year			2
@entity238 , of @entity239 , who is representing miss @entity15 ’s family , said : ‘ they are sickened			1
‘ there is a sense from the family this does not demonstrate any type of remorse for what he has done			0
‘ it has extended the suffering unnecessarily for these people			0
‘ this is a shameful action			0
it has put them through costs they ca n’t really afford			0
’ he added : ‘ we do not believe that the law was written to allow people like @entity10 to benefit from his crime			2
we intend to fight his claim on behalf of the family			0
