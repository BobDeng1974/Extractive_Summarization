@entity1 's weaknesses were exposed by an impressive @entity2 on saturday night , leaving manager @entity3 with plenty of problems to address			1
if they are to repeat last season 's heroics and mount a sustained challenge for the @entity11 title , the manager will need to make quick fixes			0
here 's five areas in which the @entity14 were shown up by the @entity2 at @entity15			1
@entity1 's 3 - 1 defeat at @entity2 exposed a number of weaknesses that @entity3 needs to address panic in the defence @entity1 's back line were clearly not mentally prepared for the game and they were breached twice in the opening seven minutes			1
@entity22 and @entity23 looked in utter disarray right from the off , while goalkeeper @entity26 got his positioning all wrong			1
granted , it was only the third time @entity23 and @entity22 have started together at the heart of the defence but they were lightweight and unable to deal with the power and physicality of @entity35 and @entity36			1
@entity1 's defence try to organise themselves as @entity2 line up a set - piece @entity22 is beaten to the ball by @entity2 's @entity35 @entity3 did the right thing in removing @entity41 for @entity42 after just 20 minutes and his three - man defence helped give @entity1 some impetus going forward			1
yet when @entity23 and @entity36 clashed heads in the first - half , it neatly summed up the chaos			0
the defence lacked cohesion and leadership and @entity3 will be alarmed at how long it may take for his new - look rearguard to gel together			2
@entity23 was left dazed after a clash of heads with @entity42 during the first - half lack of concentration as alluded to , there were too many moments when @entity1 switched off and @entity2 were swift in punishing them			1
@entity26 , who was at fault for the @entity62 goals in the @entity63 in midweek , was stood in the wrong place as @entity65 sent a high free - kick to the far post inside the first 90 seconds , allowing @entity68 to head down and @entity69 to tap in			2
@entity70 and @entity22 were also culpable in the @entity2 ' opening goal as they failed to deal with the cross			2
for the second goal , six minutes later , @entity26 was exposed again when @entity36 found the top corner with an audacious dink from the edge of the area			0
@entity26 picks the ball out of his net after @entity36 beat him for @entity2 's second goal left - back @entity81 was also guilty of not being alert enough to close the @entity2 man down			1
during the second half , @entity22 miscontrolled a back pass and @entity36 pinched the ball from him on the edge of the area			0
the @entity88 defender got away with that one but @entity42 was n't so lucky two minutes from time when his weak header went straight to the feet of @entity65			0
his perfect through ball to @entity94 resulted in @entity2 's third goal and made absolutely sure of victory			2
@entity3 is all - too - aware that mistakes like these will prove costly in the @entity11 and especially in the @entity63			0
@entity42 is beaten to the ball by his namesake @entity99 during the match at @entity15 no control in midfield @entity103 sent his team out with intent and purpose and they quickly seized control of the midfield , a grip they did n't relinquish for the full 90 minutes			2
it is rare to see @entity112 and @entity70 have such poor games and @entity114 was n't a great deal better			0
indeed , the @entity116 was replaced at half - time by @entity118 as @entity3 desperately tried to inject a bit more creativity			0
by contrast , the @entity2 midfield were on top of their game			0
the bustling @entity126 was one of the stand - out performers in this match and of the @entity11 afternoon			0
@entity3 issues instructions to his captain @entity112 @entity70 comes under pressure from @entity2 's @entity94 @entity103 has likened him to @entity132 and his robust challenges certainly had @entity1 rattled			1
@entity134 revealed before the match that he used to train in a @entity112 shirt but there was certainly no deference for his idol as he patrolled the midfield along with @entity126 and @entity141			0
this is by no means the best midfield @entity1 will face this season , yet they still found themselves overpowered			2
@entity144 was dynamic in @entity2 's midfield and a key part of the win video we dominated @entity1 - @entity103 where are the goals coming from ? @entity151 vowed to stay at @entity152 and fight for his place but he did n't put forward a very convincing argument here			1
the striker was bombarded with abusive tweets after a limp performance in which he failed to provide a cutting edge to @entity1 's attack			2
@entity3 opted for the @entity161 ahead of @entity162 and handed him a first start of the season but @entity2 's defence were n't unduly troubled			1
@entity151 rues a missed chance on a disappointing afternoon for the striker his strike partner @entity168 played him in with a brilliant cross-field ball on 53 minutes but @entity151 opted to shoot , straight at goalkeeper @entity170 , rather than pulling the ball back to better - placed colleagues			1
@entity3 will be desperate to get @entity173 fit and firing as soon as possible given the shortcomings of the alternatives			0
@entity176 still a liability ? there has been a lot of talk from both @entity3 that @entity168 is a reformed character who has consigned his immature antics to history			0
but the hotheaded @entity161 flared up in the second half when he went head - to - head with @entity2 's @entity170			1
the keeper foolishly kicked out at @entity168 after a heavy tackle but the striker 's reaction was disappointing to see			0
both were fortunate to get away with a caution			0
@entity168 will score plenty of goals for @entity1 but that nagging doubt remains that he might be a liability with that aggression never far away			2
@entity168 squares up to @entity2 goalkeeper @entity170 following a heavy challenge @entity168 receives a yellow card after his argument with the @entity2 keeper			1
