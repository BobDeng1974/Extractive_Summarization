the teenager was able to use the social networking site to arrange to send images privately of the 15 - year - old girl to a friend after they had agreed the fee			1
a court heard how the boy had 170 images of the victim , which he was preparing to distribute before police raided his home			1
the victim had emailed the defendant the intimate photographs of herself during their short relationship			1
she told police that after they broke up she saw @entity9 messages which revealed the photos of her had been sold			1
police then seized her ex-boyfriend ’s laptop , desktop computer and mobile phone			2
a second defendant , aged 15 at the time , claimed his friend had accidentally sent him an image of the girl , but he had then asked for more			1
he admitted paying £ 10 for two more explicit photos , which he put in a locked file on his computer			1
last night @entity9 declined to comment on this particular case but said alerts about inappropriate material were taken seriously			1
a spokesman also stressed that there is no mechanism with which to make purchases on @entity9			1
none of those involved in the case can be named for legal reasons			0
the teenager , who is now 16 , appeared at @entity56 's youth court alongside the second defendant to answer charges			1
they were both given 12 month referral orders and must pay £ 100 in costs @entity60 , prosecuting , told a youth court in @entity56 that the girl did not realise she was doing anything wrong when she agreed to send the pictures to her boyfriend			1
she added : ‘ when the relationship ended she asked that [ he ] destroy the photographs			2
it turned out the photos were then passed on to [ the defendant ’s friend ] for a small sum of money			2

images shared via email , on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught			2
victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet			2
many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the @entity3 , and requests to remove content are often ignored			2
in some cases , asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images			0
the move to clamp down on ' revenge porn ' came after 149 cases , the vast majority of them involving women victims , were reported over two and a half years			0
only six led to prosecutions			0
however , the new rules do not affect the consensual ' sexting ' of images by under - 18s			2

@entity172 , professor of social responsibility in it at @entity175 , said it was ‘ encouraging ’ that the case had gone to court because it showed the victim felt she could come forward			0
he said : ‘ the fact there was money exchanged , the volume of images and that she was an ex-girlfriend indicates some malice in this case			0
it ’s encouraging it has gone to court			0
in most incidents like this the victim would n’t have thought to complain			0
’ @entity193 , of the charity @entity194 , said yesterday : ‘ it is essential that schools and parents educate young people about the potentially serious consequences of taking and sharing sexual images			0
‘ sex education in the digital age needs to teach young people the laws surrounding sex and the internet , and how consent , respect and trust are essential both online and offline			0
we can all do more to ensure that young people are given the tools and knowledge they need to stay safe online			0
