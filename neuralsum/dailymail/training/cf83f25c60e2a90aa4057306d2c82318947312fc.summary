by @entity0 @entity1 : 15:19 est , 31 december 2013 updated : 04:43 est , 1 january 2014 the pound hit its highest level for nearly three years yesterday , and shares ended 2013 on the front foot in a vote of confidence for the @entity9 economy			1
the ftse 100 index of blue - chip companies rose 17.82 points to 6749.09 , taking total gains for the year to £ 200billion – an increase of around 14 per cent			2
the pound also performed well , going up around half a per cent to $ 1.6565 and € 1.2022			2
boost : the pound goes into 2014 at its highest level in almost three years rollercoaster : the @entity18 edged up another 18 points from 6,731 today to end the year at 6,749			1
@entity20 is now at its highest level against the dollar since april 2011 having clocked up a second year of gains – although this could make @entity9 's exports less competitive			1
last year also saw the best @entity28 stock market results since 2009 , boosting the value of pension pots and investments for millions of workers and savers			1
the stock market and the pound benefited from stronger than expected growth throughout 2013 , as the economy finally emerged from the doldrums			1
the @entity9 economy looks set to have grown by around 1.5 per cent in 2013 and could grow by as much as 3 per cent in 2014 , according to analysts			1
that would be the best performance since 2007 when output rose by 3.4 per cent before crashing in the recession of 2008 and 2009			2
it would also put @entity9 among the best - performing developed economies in the world , well ahead of @entity49 rivals @entity50 and @entity51			0
the brighter outlook – and the sharp fall in unemployment to 7.4 per cent , its lowest level since early 2009 – has fuelled speculation that an interest rate rise is on the way			1
the @entity59 has pledged not to raise rates from the current all - time low of 0.5 per cent until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower			0
governor @entity63 has insisted that 7 per cent is a ' threshold ' and not a ' trigger ' for an automatic rate hike in a bid to dampen expectations			1
but the surge in the pound – which benefits from higher interest rates – suggests many in the financial markets believe a rate hike is coming			1
soaring : the @entity75 is up by almost a third this year			2
@entity20 has jumped from below $ 1.49 in july when mr @entity63 succeeded @entity76 as governor – a rise of more than 10 per cent			1
@entity79 , an economist at @entity80 , said : ' after some extended gloom , 2013 was a year of mainly positive surprises for the @entity9 economy			2
' mr @entity79 believes unemployment will hit 7 per cent during the second quarter of 2014 and could be down to 6.7 per cent by the end of the year			0
but he played down the prospects of a rate hike this year			1
he said : ' expectations are mounting that the @entity59 could start to raise interest rates in 2014			0
however , the @entity59 will want to give the economy as much chance as possible to establish broad - based growth and is more likely to hold off from raising interest rates until the first half of 2015			0
' @entity95 issued a profit warning yesterday following a nightmare @entity97 which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts			0
@entity9 's second - biggest department store said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £ 85million			2
the chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its january sale in a desperate attempt to shift leftover @entity97 stock			0
the news saw the retailer 's share price fall more than 10 per cent in early trading yesterday , wiping £ 140million off its stock market value			1
city analysts believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period			0
as a result , shares in the likes of @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 's and @entity127 have all been marked down in recent days			0
@entity95 ' bosses described festive trading as ' extremely difficult ' and competitive , with a large number of early sales			0
' we did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in january and february , ' they said			2
the five - year cost of living squeeze , bad weather and a shift to internet shopping have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets			0
major chains were forced to bring forward sales and bargain promotions ahead of @entity97 during what one industry insider described as ' a bit of a bloodbath '			0
the gloomy trading update comes just days after reports that @entity95 was under pressure to axe its finance chief , @entity158 , amid shareholder concern over his performance .			0

2013 was the best year for the @entity28 stock market since 2009
pension pots and investments boosted for millions of workers and savers
@entity20 is now at its highest level against the dollar since april 2011
