@entity1 's new zig - zag patterned haircut drew a range of reactions when he unveiled it to the world ahead of @entity6 's 2 - 2 draw with the @entity7 on wednesday			1
but according to a story circulating online it seems his new engraving on the right side of his head is less of a fashion statement and more of a kind gesture towards a young boy in @entity16			0
@entity1 paid @entity18 's entire £ 50,000 medical fee as he underwent brain surgery recently and the jagged line incorporated into his new haircut is rumoured to be a nod to the youngster 's surgery scars			1
@entity25 : the @entity28 winners new haircut might be a hint to his charity work earlier this year bizarre : the @entity33 winger showed off his new design for the first time against the @entity7 respect : the unconfirmed rumour has been making waves among plenty of @entity1 fans on @entity41 @entity42 had his surgery in february this year and @entity1 's design is believed to mirror the marks made in the operation - although the @entity47 forward has yet to confirm or deny the claims			2
however , the @entity6 captain very rarely speaks publicly about his charity work and is therefore unlikely to be tweeting to explain his tribute anytime soon			0
strange : @entity53 's @entity52 almost looks as if he has a burnt cake on top of his head here in training three lions , three lines : @entity61 may have been impressed for @entity62 but his hair was not ahead of the rest : @entity1 's international team - mate @entity65 has long been known for his odd style @entity68 's trunk : @entity70 star @entity69 is seen here sporting a thin blond line on an otherwise normal cut @entity1 's inspiration ? like the @entity33 forward , @entity74 is sporting shaved lines on his head swish : @entity79 and @entity81 's @entity80 shows off his cut against @entity83 odd : @entity53 's @entity85 is sporting a ' 3 ' on the side of his head - his squad number for his country			0
