@entity0 has the tweed jacket , @entity2 the quirky phone case - but when it comes to the @entity6 , @entity4 rules the runway			2
and today 's @entity9 catwalk presentation on the final day of @entity10 only served to reassert the brand 's bag genius			1
the eyes in the front row were permanently fixed on the totes swinging jauntily down the runway			0
@entity4 presented an array of seventies inspired bags at their @entity9 catwalk the brand has always been most famous for its luggage , with style icons such as @entity23 adopting the signature monogrammed cases back in @entity26			1
since then , it become the luggage of choice for everyone from @entity31 to @entity32 , with countless airport pap shots featuring the brown and cream leather cases			0
for his second season at the @entity39 fashion house , designer @entity36 , 43 , presented a collection that looked back to the @entity41			1
wide - legged velvet flares were paired with patterns that echoed the interiors of that decade in bold floral prints			0
the bags took a step away from the traditional logo totes that the brand is famous for always on trend @entity50 appeared at this morning 's show with the latest @entity4 accessory draped over one shoulder @entity36 did n't steer completely away from tradition with the @entity4 print appearing on a select few handbags but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown the theme of the time warp extended to the accessories - and of course the brand 's famous arm candy			1
bags took centre stage in all forms - with several even appearing as a print on the fabric of the models ' skirts			0
@entity4 took a step away from the brown leather bags and @entity4 initials that the brand is so famous for			1
the bags that replaced them came in the same seventies colour palette as the collection in an array of mohogany , orange and , of course , denim			2
as well as smaller clutches @entity36 presented large carry - alls perfect for working girls most were paired with the chain strap often associated with the classic @entity0 bag			0
both innovative in design and practical the chain can prevent bag theft as thieves are unable to snip the strap			0
but @entity36 did n't break completely with tradition , with the @entity4 print appearing a select few handbags , but in red and black rather than the traditional cream and brown @entity50 was lucky enough to have already got her hands on this small box clutch a crocodile skin effect seemed to be the pattern of choice for the brand 's latest accessories the seventies theme continued onto the bags that seemed to have taken inspiration from bold prints of that decade this is not the first time that we have seen @entity36 work his magic on the old favourite			1
last season - his very first at the brand - the designer put a new spin on the traditional logo			2
models took to the catwalk carrying the @entity125 , a rectangular shaped bag with a fold over lid top , clasps and buckles give the appearance of a traditional vanity case or treasure chest			0
the show always attracts plenty of celebrity fans with today 's front row including @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			1
@entity50 proved to be the biggest fan of all			0
refusing to wait until after the show to get her hands on the latest designs , the 31 - year - old model was spotted wearing one of the bags seen on today 's runway as she entered the show			1
the rest of us , however , might have to wait a little longer - and save up for a few years - before we get our hands on them ... @entity138 was present at this morning 's catwalk show wearing @entity4 of course @entity140 ( left ) and @entity139 ( right ) were also spotted arriving at the show this morning			2
