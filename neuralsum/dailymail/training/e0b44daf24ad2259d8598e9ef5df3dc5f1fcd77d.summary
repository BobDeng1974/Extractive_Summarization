struggle to find the right shade of lipstick ? never feel you can find foundation to match your skin ? well , it may surprise you to know that , for years , wealthy women have rejected one - colour - suits - all cosmetics in favour of having beauty products made specifically to suit them			1
and now — thanks to a raft of new @entity16 services — the rest of us can get in on the act , too			1
@entity20 rounds up the best bespoke beauty products at bargain basement prices			1
@entity23 cosmetics a @entity25 offer a bespoke lipstick service at the @entity28 shop @entity30 lipstick service , £ 50 per lipstick , at @entity32 , alacartelondon.com make an appointment at the pretty @entity28 shop , in @entity36 ’s @entity35 , and you will be talked through the bespoke make - up of your choice : eyeshadow , foundation or lipstick			1
foundations are blended to your skin tone and eyeshadows and lipsticks can be any shade you like			1
compare this £ 50 price tag per product with the bespoke lipstick i have heard about , which would set you back more than £ 40,000 ( the case is made of gold and is covered in jewels )			1
i sit down with manager @entity56 — these all take place in person — and she asks what i ’m looking for			2
i know exactly what i want			2
back in the @entity63 , @entity62 made a lipstick called @entity65 — a rich reddish purple which i wore throughout my teens			2
i ’ve never found anything which suits me quite so well			1
the shop is literally packed with hundreds of lipsticks , so i select one that is similar , but too dark and not as sheer as my teen favourite			2
so @entity56 scrapes a little off this , then some from a rich lip balm with gold flecks and mixes them together with a brush on a small palate			2
it looks gorgeous when i try it on and i am transported back to my teens			2
‘ wait a moment , ’ says @entity56			2
‘ why do n’t we add just a touch of rose pink ? ’ she mixes in a bit of a pinker lipstick and i apply it again			2
without wanting to sound evangelical ( or vain ) , it looks staggering			2
ok , £ 50 is a lot for a lipstick , but i waste so much money on shades which do n’t suit me that i think it money well spent			1
verdict : i am presented with two stunning lipsticks — one the grown up version of @entity65 and another a slightly ( and admittedly more flattering ) pinker shade			2
@entity98 ( after my grandmother ) and @entity100 ( after my daughter ) are just perfect			2
10/10 perfume the @entity102 hold events nationwide where you learn about perfume and create your own blend ( picture posed by model ) @entity102 , from £ 39 , theperfumestudio.com master perfumer @entity109 is the inspiration behind the business			0
this cheerful but austere @entity112 is a fourth generation perfumer whose father worked at @entity115 in the @entity116			0
they hold events nationwide for 20 - odd participants , where you learn about perfume and then create your own blend			1
i am astonished by the low prices			1
a high - end , bespoke perfume could easily cost £ 25,000			1
i meet with consultant manager @entity126 in @entity36			0
consultations and events are all in person , though once they have details of your perfume on the database , you can simply order more			0
she shows me an array of glass bottles , containing 18 blends of perfume oils , arranged in three sets of six and explains the three key notes of a perfume : the base , middle and the top			0
the plan is that you select three from these blends — one from each section — to create your own			0
i am invited to dip a scent strip ( basically a strip of paper ) into each one and smell it			0
i ’m surprised at how easily i discard most of them — anything spicy is instantly put to one side			0
i especially like @entity157 , which is reminiscent of damp grass on a warm june evening , and i also love a floral blend similar to @entity161 by @entity162 , which i wear most of the time			0
when i have isolated my three favourite smells , they are poured into a bottle , and blended to create my own fragrance			0
tempting as it is to call my perfume @entity20 ( the one time my surname comes in handy ) i hold off , and call it @entity171 instead			0
verdict : the result is all of my favourite scents in one little bottle			0
it has the sweetness of @entity161 , but with a hint of fresh grass			0
i am over the moon and waft happily through the next few days			0
a session would make an amazing present			1
9/10 @entity182 @entity184 bespoke products start at £ 12 ( picture posed by model ) @entity184 , £ 40 , jenniferyoung.co.uk ‘ i wanted to be able to offer bespoke products to everyone , ’ says @entity184 when i ask her about her extraordinarily low prices			1
consultations are either in person , on the phone or online and products start at £ 12			1
@entity30 face creams tend to cost at least as much as a week ’s groceries			0
there is a beautiful , but pricey offering for £ 195 from @entity198 and , this week , a new one was reported as being exclusively available at the @entity200 for an extraordinary £ 950 , made with your own blood ( yuck )			1
so i am enchanted with the idea of having a face cream with my name on it , especially as people ( my husband ) are always stealing things from my bathroom shelf			0
@entity184 and one of her consultants come to meet me to talk through the process and she tries a few different oils on the back of my hand			0
‘ the ones which suit your skin sink in , ’ she explains — macadamia nut oil leaves no residue but rosehip sits on the top			1
next , she asks me to identify three key issues which i ’d like to tackle in order to select the most beneficial essential oils			0
i think hard and decide on sleeplessness , mature skin and anger ( come on , it ’s winter )			1
she suggests a soothing combination of lavender , bergamot and sandalwood			0
two days later , my very own face cream arrives in the post			0
verdict : the originally named @entity171 ’s moisturiser is richly scented and cotton soft			0
i pat it onto my face after a bath and my skin feels deliciously smooth			1
@entity243 mentioning : having your name on a product does n’t stop people nicking it			0
7/10 foundation protect and @entity250 in @entity251 , £ 16.59 , @entity252 no 7 match made service , free in more than 900 stores nationwide , ( @entity256 and @entity250 in @entity251 , £ 16.59 , boots.com ) boots ’ own brand no 7 has developed a gadget which takes a close - up shot of your skin then exactly matches it to one of their foundations			1
the accepted method of testing foundation along my jawline and then looking at it in daylight is so last decade			0
this is a mobile - phone - like device containing a camera , which , when held against your face , takes 27 individual pictures of the skin using led lights , covering the whole colour spectrum			1
these pictures are analysed by the machine and every single element of your skin tone ( looking at yellows and blues as well as light and dark ) is matched to the ideal foundation shade			1
after a couple of minutes , the screen flashes up with the information that my ideal skin product is @entity292 in @entity256 and @entity250			1
clearly , the service is only applicable to no 7 products , although it can recommend products if you want to go lighter or darker than your natural skin tone ( which is fairly likely in early february )			1
verdict : it ’s a perfectly pleasant foundation , evening out my skin and giving it a dewy finish			1
however , it ’s a bit paler than i ’d like ideally			0
a good service , but it feels a bit of a gimmick 6/10 @entity307 facial oil , £ 40 , skinbistro.co.uk award - winning scientist and skincare specialist @entity309 makes bespoke products for anyone wanting a touch of luxury , as well as those who struggle to find the right products for specific skin needs			1
her blends are made with completely natural and @entity320 ingredients			0
facial oils are gloriously moisturising			0
as it happens , i have just finished the final drops of one , which i ca n’t justify replacing in these belt - tightened post-tax - bill times			2
when i shop around , i find that a personally blended oil can cost £ 250 if you go to a luxury brand such as @entity328			2
not a chance ! i fill in the online consultation form , which is detailed — asking both skin condition and tone , skincare routine , diet and any medical conditions or allergies			1
@entity309 writes back to me ( you can also have a phone call ) recommending that she use rosehip oil which is good for fine lines , camellia for intense moisturising , hemp , kiwi and avocado			0
verdict : ironically , the bottle is similar to that produced by the expensive cousin and the oil is both blissfully moisturising on my skin and smells as though it cost at least twice the price			2

do you struggle to find make - up that suits your skin tone ?
it *'s* not always easy to find shades to complement your colouring
