by @entity1 reporter published : 07:00 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 11 december 2013 the outbreak of bubonic plague has been confirmed in a @entity5 village after at least 20 people died in a week			1
the deaths occurred in a village near the north - western town of @entity10 , and today medical experts on the island confirmed the outbreak			1
last year , 60 people in @entity15 died from bubonic plague , more than in any other country in the world			1
disease : bubonic plague , carried by fleas like this one , is sweeping through @entity15 while the disease has been almost entirely eradicated from @entity23 , there were 256 cases of bubonic plague recorded in @entity15 last year			1
public health officials had warned of the risk of an outbreak in october - the month is the start of the danger period for the disease as fleas which spread the plague thrive in the humid weather			1
the @entity34 and the @entity35 are now working in the country to prevent bubonic plague from becoming even more common , according to the @entity37			2
idyllic : but @entity15 , pictured , is now the plague capital of the world with 256 cases last year experts are particularly concerned about the prospect of an epidemic started in @entity15 's crowded and filthy prisons and then spreading when inmates are released or receive visitors			1
rats living in the prisons often carry fleas which transmit bubonic plague to humans by biting them			1
the disease can then escape to the outside world via staff , visitors , freed inmates or the rats themselves			0
' if the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town , ' @entity59 of the @entity35 told the @entity37			2
' the prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town			0
' the @entity34 is working to eradicate the disease , but this is particularly difficult as it is necessary not only to kill the rats themselves but also to destroy the fleas living on them			0
although the disease can be cured by antibiotics , rural residents often do not have access to even basic healthcare and can be ashamed to seek treatment			0
one farmer told the @entity37 he had not been allowed to bury his daughter after she died of plague , as officials took her body into quarantine and buried it themselves			0
devastation : the @entity88 saw bodies piled up on carts dragged through the streets of @entity23 bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history , having killed around 100million people in the ' @entity88 ' which hit @entity23 in the 14th century			2
it is caused by a bacterium known as @entity99 , which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats			0
the disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin , armpits or neck , known as ' buboes '			0
it kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated , although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive			0
after the @entity88 arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in @entity23 , with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century			0
bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world , with 90 per cent of all cases now found in @entity124			1
however , there have been a few non-fatal cases in the @entity127 in recent years , while in august this year a 15 - year - old boy died in @entity129 after eating a groundhog infected with the disease .			2
