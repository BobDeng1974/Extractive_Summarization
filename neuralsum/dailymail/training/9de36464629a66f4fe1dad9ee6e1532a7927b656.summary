ten years since that first whispered press conference with partner @entity6 sitting shyly in a corner of the room			0
ten years since that explosive debut hat - trick against @entity10 in the @entity11			0
@entity2 has achieved much with his club and many ambitions have been satisfied			0
at home in the @entity18 commuter belt , he has five @entity20 medals and one from the @entity11			0
now he is captain at @entity21 and his country ’s new leader , too			2
it is time for phase two , time to show that he is capable of surviving and thriving in a louis van gaal team that looks to be set up perfectly for him			1
when @entity2 signed his new @entity3 contract last autumn , he was given assurances about transfers			1
almost a year on , he finds himself playing in a @entity3 team featuring players such as @entity53 and @entity54			1
no longer does @entity2 have to waste energy scurrying across the field in search of possession			0
no longer does he need to drop deep looking for the ball , looking for momentum			0
once again he is a centre forward in the truest sense of the term			0
first day : rooney with partner @entity6 and sir @entity63 on the day he signed for @entity3 decorated : @entity2 has won five @entity20 titles , one @entity11 trophy and two @entity66 the identity crisis that sometimes seemed to overcome him during the later sir @entity63 years should , by rights , be no more			1
as such the responsibility to show that he is still worth the £ 250,000 - a - week salary , worth the armband , is now his			1
on saturday at @entity27 , @entity2 looked the part , physically at least			1
as the players emerged from a tunnel hardly wide enough to stand @entity79 , the 28 - year - old looked as lean as he ever has			1
his performance , though , was modest and fitful			2
at the end of the game , it was hard to remember him being on the end of an opportunity			0
this says much about @entity3 ’s performance			2
despite promising work from @entity54 on his debut , @entity90 ’s team did n’t function effectively as an attacking unit			0

he has always been a talismanic figure for @entity3 , often inspiring successful @entity3 teams with his hard work but also with moments of genuine quality and inspiration			0
at @entity27 he was n’t able to do that			0
at his best , @entity2 is a wonderfully instinctive footballer			0
on saturday , though , he was unable to find the sureness of touch , the right pass , or the yard of space he needed in which to work			0
there was one fine pass to @entity54 in the second half that gave the @entity122 a sniff of a chance on his left foot and , later , there was a clever bit of movement at the far post that allowed him time to head down towards the bottom corner			0
skipper : @entity3 manager @entity24 has made @entity2 his club 's captain this season that effort only found the side netting , though			1
unfortunately , there was not much more			0

yet the @entity3 boss said he needs to see proof he was right			0
‘ i think he is ready for it but the future shall confirm that or not , ’ said @entity90			0
‘ i can not predict that but my opinion at the moment is that he shall be a great captain for @entity3			2

the @entity160 starred for the @entity159 but was injured in the quarter - final as @entity159 were eliminated by @entity162			0
he returned to the country amid much fanfare and became the subject of a bid by @entity168			0
