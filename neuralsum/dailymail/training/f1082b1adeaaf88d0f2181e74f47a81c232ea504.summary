by @entity0 published : 09:50 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 11:03 est , 8 august 2013 these images show the incredible transformation of a scorpion , simply by switching from daylight to uv light			1
the scorpion is better known as the @entity7 @entity6 and is a particularly aggressive species when threatened			1
scientists are not sure why the predatory arthropod glows blue , but there are various theories as to why it could be			0
scientists are not sure why scorpions glow under uv light but there are various theories as to why it could be scientists are not sure why they do this , but there are various theories as to why it could be			1
researchers at @entity30 have suggested that it could be be a crude tool for allowing the creatures to work out when a night is too bright for them to safely venture out			1
another popular theory is that the glowing is a form of protection from the sun - that it allows the scorpions to convert harmful uv rays into harmless visible light			1
the fluorescence is caused by chemicals in the cuticles of the scorpions hard outer body parts			2
as a scorpion matures the intensity of the fluorescence increases			1
@entity50 , @entity51 at @entity52 told @entity53 : ' there is no proven reason as to why they glow but one popular belief is that they glow so that individual scorpions can see each other in the dark			2
' new - born @entity62 do not glow and it ’s believed that this is so other adults ca n’t seem them and try and eat them			2
' researchers at @entity30 suggested that it could be be a crude tool for allowing them to work out when a night is too bright for them to safely go out			2
the scientists believe that the scorpions can not see uv light so would be unable to tell whether it was a bright night			1
therefore , they think they evolved the ability to glow under uv light as they can see themselves glowing green and are alerted to the danger			1
another popular theory is that the glowing is a form of protection from the sun - that it allows the scorpions to convert harmful uv rays into harmless visible light			1
although scientists do n't know why the scorpion glows , they do know how			2
scorpions have fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle of their sclertie , or hardened body parts , and these chemicals include beta - carboline			0
the fluorescence occurs as a result of @entity99 , which is the process of the body part hardening			0
as the scorpion matures and moves through its development stages , called instars , the intensity of the glow increases			1
the predatory arthropod is usually found in peaty areas of @entity7 and @entity108 and can reach the length of 12 cm. the species tends to live in groups , but is thought to show cannibalistic tendencies			0
pictures have been taken of an amazing , glowing scorpion at @entity52			0
it is a @entity7 @entity6 which glows under uv light if they are caught , they can be extremely aggressive , especially towards other scorpions , predators such as meerkats and a particular type of centipede called @entity124			1
heterometrus laoticus are part of the @entity128 family of giant forest scorpions and is known to contain some of the largest scorpions on earth			0
despite their behaviour , most do not have a fatal sting			0
the symptoms from a @entity128 sting are classed as mild and there have been no reported human fatalities			0
however , the sting can cause local pain , inflammation , swelling and redness of the skin and these symptoms can last for days			0
scorpions have been found in many fossil records and the oldest known scorpions lived around 430 million years ago on the bottom of shallow tropical seas			0
these pictures have been released to celebrate the @entity151 ( @entity152 & @entity153 @entity154 at @entity52 until 11th august			0
the event is taking place in various zoos and aquariums around the country .			0

it is a @entity7 @entity6 - also known as @entity162
all scorpions glow under uv light but scientists do not know why
it could be a way of alerting them if a night is too bright to allow them to go out safely or it could be a form of protection from the @entity173
as a scorpion gets older the intensity of the fluorescence increases
