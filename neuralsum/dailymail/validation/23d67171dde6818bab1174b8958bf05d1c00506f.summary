leaks by the @entity3 traitor @entity4 have ‘ damaged ’ intelligence agencies across the world and drained vital resources from @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , @entity0 warned last night			1
the home secretary made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive – who stole 1.7 million top - secret documents from @entity3 ’s @entity16 and @entity10			1
the secret techniques revealed by the subsequent leaks to the @entity20 newspaper have made it easier for terrorists , jihadis and organised criminals to avoid detection			2
leaks by the @entity3 traitor @entity4 ( pictured ) have ‘ damaged ’ intelligence agencies across the world @entity0 has warned last night , it emerged vital safe houses had also been lost			1
security officials have had to abandon buildings used to house top - secret sources for fear they have been compromised – at huge cost to the @entity37 taxpayer			0
in evidence to mps , home secretary mrs may said : ‘ i assess and so does the director general of @entity8 that the @entity4 leaks did cause damage			1
‘ it has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do			0
it would be fair to say it has had an impact not just on agencies in the @entity37			0
‘ if work has been done to try to mitigate the impact , that uses resources ’			0
@entity61 mp @entity60 , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ it is clear to me the damage @entity4 has done is monumental			1
‘ not only has he jeopardised national security by his leaks , but he has also put people at risk and it is clear that he has also caused considerable financial loss			1
’ it came amid new revelations about the extent to which @entity37 extremists are attempting to travel to @entity75 to join @entity76			0
mrs may said that - in the few weeks since the law was changed – five suspected jihadis had been subjected to a new power allowing for the seizure of their passports			0
police are now assessing whether the extremists can be charged with any criminal offences			0
security officials say @entity86 has seized on the @entity4 leaks and has passed on information to its operatives – making it harder to track them down			1
the home secretary ( pictured ) made a scathing attack on the harm caused by the fugitive – who stole 1.7 million top - secret documents from @entity3 ’s @entity16 and @entity10 @entity96 is also known to have pounced on the leaks			1
the terror group ’s senior operatives have changed the way they communicate to avoid detection			0
they have also produced a video tape handed to extremists , passing on tips			0
the chilling seven - and - a - half minute video – which includes news footage of @entity4 ’s massive security breach – provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by ‘ @entity110 technology ’ when communicating			1
it also claims to identify technology companies who are co-operating with the @entity37 and other countries so they can be avoided			0
there is a list of software packages which can be used to try to thwart @entity10 and the intelligence agencies			1
at the same time , @entity10 has lost track of some of @entity37 ’s most dangerous criminals because of the way the fugitive exposed its operations			1
intelligence officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs , paedophiles , human traffickers and money launderers			0
up to a quarter of crime gangs are believed to be going undetected , sources have said			0
in other cases , @entity10 has toned down or abandoned surveillance amid fears that the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to ‘ go dark ’ and fall off the radar completely			1
among the gangs left able to operate unhindered was a drug - smuggling ring which had continued to bring @entity141 narcotics into @entity37			0
ex-mi5 boss @entity142 said the @entity4 revelations have left @entity37 less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from @entity147 fanatics is surging			1
former security minister @entity148 said : ‘ since the revelations of the traitor @entity4 , terrorist groups – in particular @entity149 ( @entity76 ) – have changed their methods of communications and shifted to other ways of talking to each other			2
‘ consequently there are people dying who actually would now be alive			0
’ @entity10 has also warned that some companies had begun advertising internet products that were supposedly ‘ @entity162 ’			2
@entity4 , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity165 , tricked colleagues into giving him passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in @entity3 history			1
the defence contractor claims he had to act because the @entity3 and other @entity175 government ’s policies were a ‘ threat to democracy ’			2
he fled to @entity178 , then @entity179 , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location but last week , @entity183 ’s @entity182 cleared @entity10 of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic			2
devastatingly , it said the central claims made by the @entity20 newspaper - that @entity10 had ‘ blanket coverage ’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages - were wrong			2
in reality , it said , @entity10 can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘ tiny fraction ’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process			2
the committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ‘ highest intelligence value ’ , and these amounted to several thousand a day .			0
