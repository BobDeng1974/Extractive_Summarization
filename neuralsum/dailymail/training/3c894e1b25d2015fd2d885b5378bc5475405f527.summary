by @entity0 @entity1 has a plan to save its fading movie and television industries			1
that ’s right , the entertainment industry in @entity1 is fading			1
with most big - budget films and television shows now being filmed on location outside of @entity11 as they gobble up tax credits elsewhere , newly elected mayor @entity7 wants to expand the state ’s incentive program and create the position of film czar in an effort to keep entertainment industry employment from falling any further into a state of ' emergency			1
' of this summer ’s highest - budget films , @entity25 was shot in @entity27 , @entity21 in @entity22 and @entity23 , and the @entity24 was shot in @entity28 , according to @entity29			0
the state ’s share of hour - long network dramas fell from 89 per cent in 2005 to only 39 per cent last year			0
@entity34 landmark : though the @entity34 sign is still there , many of the entertainment industry jobs it looked over have disappeared from @entity1 big and small - screen productions fleeing to locations with higher tax incentives have caused production and other industry - related positions in @entity1 to drop from a high of over 136,000 in 1997 to just under 116,000 in 2011 , according to @entity29			1
that number is up from a low of just over 94,000 though , which was during a recession			0
this loss in jobs does n’t just affect the people in the industry it also has an impact on support business such as equipment suppliers and caterers , @entity7 told @entity29			1
this , in turn causes a trickle - down effect that hurts the economy as a whole , leading to what @entity7 calls an ' emergency			1
' man with a plan : @entity1 mayor @entity7 wants to expand tax credits to the industry to save jobs over 40 states , @entity28 , @entity72 and the @entity73 now offer credits that are chipping away at @entity34 ’s bread and butter			1
the state ’s current incentive program is limited , but popular , according to @entity29			1
in order to qualify for incentives , a movie must have a budget between $ 1million and $ 75million , small beans compared to the $ 200million blockbusters filming elsewhere			0
despite this , it has been so popular a lottery system has been set up to fairly dole out the credits			0
this too has been met with criticism , with producers complaining the uncertainty makes it harder to budget features , according to @entity29			0
old school : movies are increasingly filmed on - location and less on sound stages in lots owned by large studios the first step to solving this problem , @entity7 told assembled media short ly after he was elected , is appoint a movie czar similar to what @entity105 has between city hall and the industry			1
this would help producers cut through all the red tape and get to work sooner , @entity7 argued			2
the mayor also believes the tax credit program should be expanded , but not given a blank check			2
‘ it is not in some people ’s interest to see @entity127 win , ’ @entity7 told the magazine , adding ‘ they may benefit from this competition being in as many places as possible , because it has been a race to the bottom			2
and i certainly wo n’t lead a race to the bottom			0
’ @entity7 believes that the state ’s $ 100million tax incentive program is n’t enough , but it should n’t be unlimited , he told @entity29			1
@entity105 has a program just over $ 400million , @entity29 noted			0
symbolic : @entity7 fears that the city 's title of ' movie capital of the world ' will largely become symbolic if something is not done incentives : @entity7 believes a film czar , like the one employed in @entity105 , and tax credits will lure movies and television dramas back to @entity11 the sometimes actor – @entity7 played the mayor of @entity1 in a few episodes of ‘ @entity144 ’ before he was actually elected to the job – argues that for every $ 70million spent on tax incentives , $ 5billion in economic activity is created			1
those numbers come from the worst - performing study , @entity7 noted to @entity29			2
‘ some studies have shown , at worst , some small debit to the state treasury , which is then multiplied many times over in economic activity , ’ said @entity7			2
another idea would be to provide credits to commercial shoots			0
though not the big - time productions movies and television shows require , they would at least preserve the infrastructure and the jobs , according to @entity7			1
a $ 15million bill for those incentives stalled in the @entity127 @entity164 earlier this year			0
‘ we are going to fight a lot of fights , ’ @entity7 told the magazine			2
‘ i know we are not going to win every single one of them			0
but if we do n’t put a lot of strength toward winning a couple of battles in this war , we are just going to continue to be left behind on the battlefield			0

entertainment industry jobs are *plummeting* , hurting the economy and *eroding* the infrastructure the city has to support the industry
the industry is fading as other states and countries offer tax credits enticing productions to move out of @entity34
@entity1 mayor @entity7 wants to appoint a movie czar and expand the tax incentive program to fight the drop - off
