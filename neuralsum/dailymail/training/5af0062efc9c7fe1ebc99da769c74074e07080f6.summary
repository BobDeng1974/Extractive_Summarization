@entity0 has lost her empire ... again			1
once , @entity3 ruled the airwaves , with dramas that were the envy of the world ’s broadcasters			2
but that ’s ancient history , and this week the @entity11 in @entity12 delivered fresh humiliation			2
@entity15 television shows swept the board , and they deserved to			1
that ’s because , in the @entity19 , television is revelling in a new golden age			1
far more than cinema or literature , tv is the greatest art form of the era			2
visionary hits : @entity27 ( centre ) and @entity29 ( far right ) star in @entity31 hit series @entity33 @entity15 dramas such as the political drama @entity33 , @entity36 and @entity37 are thrilling and unmissable			1
@entity38 is laugh - out - loud funny			2
but while @entity15 is embracing this golden age , we ’re still trying to resurrect the old one			1
back in the @entity43 , the @entity42 was one of the best reasons not to emigrate			2
we watched innovative dramas such as @entity46 , and brilliant comedies like @entity48 and @entity49 , with no adverts , for the price of the licence fee			2
we pitied the @entity15 , we really did			1
their shows were fragmented by commercial breaks that made viewing impossible			2
the only successful programmes on @entity15 television were chat - shows and quizzes , which could be endlessly broken up			1
but today , @entity15 programmes are paid for in a different way			1
subscription channels via cable and the internet have empowered producers to create intricate worlds over several seasons			2
they ’ve drawn viewers into the most improbable and addictive scenarios , such as @entity70 , a gruesomely compelling murder mystery starring @entity72 and @entity73 , or @entity74 , about a lawyer ’s wife trying to piece her life back together after a sex scandal			2
@entity80 , the big hits win over their audience in stages			2
first , they screen to a small , dedicated fan - base of subscribers who have paid for access to the production through cable channels such as @entity89 ( @entity89 ) or streaming internet services such as @entity31			2
that generates excitement on social media , so that when the dvd box - set is released , millions are ready to binge - watch , consuming a dozen episodes over a couple of nights			0
finally , the series is syndicated to tv channels worldwide			0
the result is a triple wave of income that funds the next unlikely but visionary hit			0
series ' like @entity36 ( pictured @entity105 , left , and @entity106 , right ) are revelling in ' golden age ' the @entity42 business model is arthritic by comparison			1
entire floors of executives maul a concept before it is approved , injecting blandness and removing risk			0
that ’s why most @entity42 programmes are either called the great @entity0 something - or - other , or @entity119 you - name - it			1
during his visit to @entity125 , @entity123 leader @entity122 took president @entity126 a present of a classic @entity42 box - set — @entity129 , the newspaper drama starring @entity131 and @entity132			0
it is under six hours long			0
however , the @entity135 ’ favourite viewing includes @entity136 and @entity36 , which both stretch to more than 50 episodes			1
nothing could illustrate more clearly how far @entity0 television has lapsed behind			1
to make it worse , if you want to catch up on shows that swept the emmys this week — with the exception of the splendid @entity145 , which picked up awards for @entity148 and @entity149 as @entity150 — do n’t expect to find them on the @entity42			0
you ’ll have to pay extra subscriptions to @entity154 , @entity31 and more			0
@entity156 stars as @entity157 in @entity37 , which is ' thrilling and unmissable ' according to @entity159 tv critic @entity158 so is this an international golden age , or do you have to be @entity15 to appreciate the shows ? the answer is that you do n’t need a @entity163 , the all - purpose @entity15 entry ticket , but you do need patience : just as when you start to read a blockbuster novel , the rewards do n’t flow within the first few scenes			1
many @entity0 viewers who gave up quickly on @entity36 complained it was too cynical to be entertaining			1
it ’s the story of @entity171 , a failed chemistry teacher , in a stale marriage , broke and dying of cancer			0
what begins as an attempt to fund his healthcare , by using his chemistry knowledge to make and sell the drug crystal meth , turns into an act of vengeance against the world			0
actor @entity106 won the @entity11 for outstanding lead actor , and the show won for outstanding drama , with another @entity11 going to @entity106 ’s co-star , @entity105			0
viewers who stuck with @entity36 beyond the opening episodes know that it becomes psychologically compelling			1
this summer , my 20 - year - old son persuaded his mother , a fan of mr @entity194 and @entity195 , to watch it with him			0
within days , they were gulping down episodes in twos and threes , quoting the dialogue and obsessively connecting the clues			0
this slow - burning addiction is typical of the best @entity15 dramas			1
the pattern was set by @entity206 , the tale of a @entity209 gangster boss and his family , launched by @entity89 in 1999			0
in his book @entity213 was televised , @entity15 tv critic @entity211 argues : ‘ @entity206 is the one that made the world realise something special was happening on television			1
’ even if @entity0 is no longer making many of the best shows in the world , at least lots of the best @entity15 shows are crammed with @entity225 talent			1
take , for instance , @entity227 , from the @entity229 cable channel , which won the @entity11 for best mini-series , and exemplifies the current superiority of tv over cinema			0
an @entity235 - winning movie from almost 20 years ago became a mesmerising ten - part fable of murder in the snowy wastes of @entity239			0
@entity149 played the central character , a timid insurance agent who , like @entity171 , turns into a criminal monster			0
@entity37 is packed from dungeon to ramparts with @entity0 thespians			1
@entity246 opened the show , as its battle - hardened hero @entity248 , before the conniving @entity249 took centre - stage as the chief puppet - master in the fantasy kingdom of @entity253			0
@entity227 from the @entity229 cable channel won @entity11 for best mini-series ( pictured @entity149 as @entity255 ) that ’s not to mention @entity257 , who won this year ’s emmy for outstanding guest actress , as the grandmother of a scheming queen			0
without this array of brilliant @entity264 , @entity15 drama would be impoverished , and the new golden age would lack much of its glitter			1
for the most part , the same can not be said for @entity0 writers , though one notable exception is @entity270 , creator of the acerbically brilliant @entity272 satire @entity271			1
he ’s transported his political nous to the @entity19 , and this week the female star of his @entity276 comedy @entity277 won her third @entity11 in a row			1
so why has it proved impossible for so many @entity0 producers to match their rivals across the @entity282 ? the moribund licence fee is only part of the problem — after all , @entity145 did net a brace of @entity11			1
but it bypassed the commissioning process that neuters and homogenises so much @entity0 drama			2
@entity291 and co-writer @entity292 had the clout to make sherlock the way they wanted it — though any fan who has seen the original pilot episode , included as an extra in the box - set , knows how close the show came to being converted into the @entity42 ’s standard output of bland and sterile fudge			0
despite the golden era of @entity15 television , @entity158 says that @entity0 dramas like @entity306 ( pictured are the cast of the @entity309 series including @entity310 , centre ) are real @entity0 contributions to the ' new golden age ' @entity291 and co-writer @entity314 the way they wanted - and it came up top at @entity11 as @entity309 drama does not go through the same centralised process , individual brilliance has a better chance of surviving			1
that has given us the two other real @entity0 contributions to the new golden age — @entity326 and @entity306			1
both were conceived by writers with a vivid and distinctive vision			0
@entity330 ’ nostalgic sense of a lost @entity225 , and @entity306 writer @entity333 ’s insight into provincial secrets , were allowed free rein			0
the result was masterful television , a match for anything @entity15 cable giants could offer			1
there are signs @entity42 is belatedly recognising the importance of a creative force that moulds a production			0
@entity346 , who had a surprise triumph with @entity348 , was allowed to make @entity349 without too much interference : the result was stunning drama			0
@entity353 , whose @entity357 - @entity356 tragedy @entity354 concluded last week on @entity358 , was given freedom as a writer and director			0
and producer @entity364 ’s police drama @entity362 also bore the hallmark of a series forged by a master craftsman			0
after lagging so badly for years , the @entity42 might finally be learning its lesson			0
but as the @entity11 humiliation emphasised , @entity0 has a lot of catching up to do .			2

television in @entity19 is revelling in new golden age says @entity158
but while @entity15 is embracing it , @entity0 is still trying to resurrect old one
@entity15 dramas like @entity36 and @entity37 are ' unmissable '
