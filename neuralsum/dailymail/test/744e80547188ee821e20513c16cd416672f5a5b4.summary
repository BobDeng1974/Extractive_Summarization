@entity0 is a country in @entity2 's @entity1 famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly , right now at least , for the fact @entity6 and her posse are there			1
@entity6 , her husband @entity8 , their daughter @entity10 and @entity6 's sister @entity11 arrived in the capital @entity13 on wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks			1
the visit is their first to the country their late father , @entity20 , fled for @entity22 and both @entity6 and @entity11 have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland			1
@entity6 is in @entity0 with her husband @entity8 and their daughter @entity10 on an eight - day visit to the country of her dad 's birth the celebrity visitors are in the capital @entity13 , a culturally rich city where the @entity37 ( centre ) is among its most notable landmarks the @entity40 is a must - visit place in the @entity43 capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity46 are staying at the @entity0 @entity13 which is on @entity47 , formerly @entity48 @entity47 is a tourist attraction in itself , with its combination of @entity52 - era architecture and @entity54 official buildings and from what @entity56 says of the city , it 's made for the icons of modern - day entertainment			1
' while it 's the undeniable cultural , economic and political heart of the nation , @entity62 can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday , ' @entity56 's introduction to its guide of the city			1
' all summer long , @entity70 saunter up and down the main boulevards , preening in high fashion and fast cars while occasionally popping into a parkside cafe to schmooze over a drink or two			0
' sounds familiar ... while there , the @entity77 crew are staying in the capital 's finest digs , the @entity0 @entity13 , which frames @entity47 at the heart of the city , and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights			1
but what would we , the mere mortals not of reality tv fame , see and do if we followed in their footsteps ? @entity13 's @entity93 is well connected to major centres throughout @entity95 although cheaper flights ( upwards of £ 300 during summer and less in colder months ) from @entity98 require a transfer somewhere like @entity100 , @entity101 or @entity102			1
without the need to book out the two executive floors of the hotel for our entourage and filming crew , as the @entity6 crew have , a standard room from 67,150 @entity43 @entity104 is good value ( sounds like a lot but works out at about £ 96 )			2
a smartphone view of the @entity116 church in the @entity118 - listed @entity117 , where @entity6 , @entity8 and @entity10 visited the monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century documenting every moment : camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites outside the @entity117 of @entity117 women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to @entity6 on their arrival in @entity0 the hotel is well chosen by their people as it 's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city , where the majority of main sights are free			1
the square is a tourist attraction in itself , with its combination of @entity52 - era architecture and neo-classical buildings such as the @entity143 of @entity144 and the @entity145 itself , but with their own @entity43 twists			0
in the heart of the cultural and business hub of @entity13 , the square is connected to the other main area of the city that has the impressive @entity40 at its centre			0
while @entity8 's hip - hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of keeping up with the @entity160 - the city is n't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres , galleries and clubs for its size , with plenty of live music to be found			1
their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it , but the @entity160 ' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the @entity176 on april 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the @entity179 between 1915 and 1917			1
@entity180 dispute the figures - they claim 300,000 to 500,000 @entity43 died during a civil uprising against the @entity179 - but @entity43 have fought for international recognition of the tragedy for decades			0
but the memory of those whose lives were taken are very much honoured in this city and throughout the country			0
the @entity190 is the main part of the @entity192 , found in the centre of @entity13 , which features an array of modern @entity43 art @entity196 , an @entity43 cross stone , are common features of medieval christian art found in the @entity190 the @entity200 features works from @entity202 and other internationally - recognised artists and a stellar view of the city this statue at the @entity190 represents @entity208 - born architect @entity207 , whose greatest work was planning modern @entity62 among the major sights on the @entity6 's itinerary is @entity13 's extensive @entity212 along with the @entity213 where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors			1
the party has already visited @entity13 's @entity0 statue , a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters			1
a visit to their father 's home city of @entity229 would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks , rocket launchers and other military items			1
' the mother @entity0 statue symbolizes peace through strength , ' @entity11 wrote on @entity240			1
' it can remind viewers of some of the prominent female figures in @entity43 history			0
who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with @entity180 troops and @entity252 irregulars			0
i am woman hear me roar ! blessed to be here ! ' @entity255 , home to the statue , also offers a brilliant view of the city @entity6 echoed the sentiment : ' this statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in @entity43 history			2
i love how powerful women are and respected so much in our culture ! ' the huge @entity0 statue ( said to be the female personification of the nation ) and military museum at @entity255 in @entity13 while there said to be more @entity43 living abroad than in the country itself , due to millions who fled the alleged genocide , local culture has been diligently preserved			2
their welcome to a packed airport included a traditional gift of bread and salt from women in traditional @entity43 dress			0
similar breads are found sold by locals at the @entity118 - listed @entity117 of @entity117 , a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where @entity6 and @entity8 have taken @entity10			1
the main chapel was built in 1215 but the complex originated in the fourth century and has a rich and varied history			0
other sights include the 3,000 - year - old @entity295 that was the beginning of @entity13 and the more modern @entity190 , @entity297 and @entity192 , their modern art centre			0
or romantics could visit @entity300 , a @entity302 - style garden which hosts open - air concerts and art exhibitions			2
while a minority are unimpressed with the celebrities ' arrival most are delighted to see them , including the government			0
the group has met with the nation 's prime minister @entity311 , who praised their contribution to ' international recognition and condemnation of the @entity43 genocide			2
' @entity318 speaker @entity317 said their visit can only be a good thing			0
' @entity6 is a lady who 's known worldwide			2
we should be happy she came here , ' he said			0
the @entity6 family tree has rich historical roots in @entity0 @entity20 , father of @entity6 , @entity326 , @entity11 and @entity327 , was a third - generation @entity328			1
the celebrity lawyer , who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer , passed on his pride in his heritage to his family , who have been vocal about their @entity43 roots			0
@entity20 's ancestors fled the @entity176 in the early 20th century , thanks to a ' prophet ' who urged them to uproot to @entity22			1
known at the time as the @entity341 , in @entity208 style , the family made their way from their home village of @entity344 in the late 19th century to @entity346 ports			0
from there , they travelled to a new life in @entity22 on the passenger vessels @entity351 and @entity352			0
by doing so , they escaped the triple horror of the @entity355 from 1914 - 18 , the ' @entity176 ' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the @entity356 in 1917			2

she was @entity6 's grandmother , who later married into the @entity6 clan			2
