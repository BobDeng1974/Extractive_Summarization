nearly half of parents have not taught their children how to dial 999 - and many youngsters think the emergency number is 911 , a study found			1
many said their children were not mature enough to learn the life - saving skill			0
and , shockingly , an even greater number said their children would not know the difference between 999 and 911 , the emergency number in the @entity12			1
it found that 37 per cent of parents had not told their children how to dial 999 , with 53 per cent claiming they had never even considered teaching them			1
but nearly half - 46 per cent - insisted that their children were not mature enough to know about who to call in an emergency			1
and concerningly , 65 per cent of parents said their children did not know the difference between 999 and @entity12 ’s 911			1
locked smartphones stuck on the ‘ enter passcode ’ screen were also a source of worry for many parents			0
78 per cent of respondents know that you can dial 999 from a locked phone , but only 23 per cent are confident their children know this			0
the survey raises fears that many youngsters are not being taught vital lessons about what to do in an emergency			1
of those parents who said they had not taught them how to dial 999 , more than 60 per cent admitted they were not confident their child would know what to do if someone collapsed , would n’t wake up or if there was a fire			0
the survey of 757 parents was carried out by @entity19 , the @entity21 ’s largest internet community for parents but campaigners say that even toddlers under the age of five should be taught how to call 999			1
the @entity19 website www.999forkids.com is now urging parents to build on their children ’s interests in the emergency services and characters like @entity66 to educate them about making an emergency call			1
and it says that parents should explain to their children what kinds of medical situations would definitely require a 999 call , such as chest pain , breathing problems , choking or drowning			2
@entity75 , head of first aid learning at the @entity77 , said : ‘ children as young as five can learn some basic first aid , but we know that even younger children can be introduced to the idea of dialling 999			2
‘ by using play - acting with your child you can help them feel confident to act in a real emergency scenario , which could potentially save a life			0
’ @entity19 have now launched a hard - hitting campaign to alert parents to the dangers of keeping their children ignorant of 999			1
the website features a poignant video real - life 999 call made by a five - year - old girl after her mother @entity95 from @entity96 , @entity97 , had an epileptic fit			0
@entity103 ’s bravery saver her mother ’s life , and those behind the campaign hope the video will service as a hard - hitting example to other parents who have yet to tell their children about 999			2
@entity108 , chairman and @entity109 of @entity110 - the company which made the film - said : ‘ in advertising , we spend our lives making up fiction to get people to care			0
‘ but there ’s nothing more powerful than the truth			0
when it ’s delivered by a child and the @entity21 ’s largest network of parents , rather than government , people will take notice			0
’ @entity127 , the ceo of @entity19 , said : ‘ nobody wants to think about the circumstances in which their child might need to call 999 , but as @entity103 ’s story shows , it can literally be a lifesaver			2
‘ we hope this powerful film will encourage parents to take a deep breath and have a chat with their children			0
