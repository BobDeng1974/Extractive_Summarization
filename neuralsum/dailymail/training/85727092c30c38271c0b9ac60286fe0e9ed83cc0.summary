smells can influence our views - and a particularly pungent one can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage , it has been claimed			1
in a new study , titled ' @entity9 and the @entity10 , ' researchers say that an odour really can change our mind - and even change our religious views			0
the team tested a range of view on people both with and without exposing them to noxious fumes			2
a terrible smell can increase our conservatism and even change our views on same sex marriage , it has been claimed			1
the researchers tested their theory with the use of a noxious smell			2
of the 57 participants , consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $ 10 for their time , 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group			0
the variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid , the smell found in rancid butter and sweat , that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room			1
' @entity9 has been implicated as a potential causal agent underlying socio - political attitudes and behaviors , ' the @entity42 team wrote in the journal @entity47			0
' the present study tested the effects of disgust on a range of policy preferences to clarify whether disgust is generally implicated in political conservatism across public policy attitudes or is uniquely related to specific content domains			0
' the team say their unusual research proved the theory			2
' the study showed that exposure to a disgusting odor increased endorsement of socially conservative attitudes related to sexuality , ' they wrote			0
' in particular , there was a strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage			1
' the researchers tested their theory with the use of a particularly offensive smell			2
of the 57 participants , consisting of community members and students recruited via an online ad and paid $ 10 for their time , 30 were randomly chosen for the control group and the remaining 27 were in the variable group			0
the variable group was exposed to a stench caused by butyric acid , the smell found in rancid butter and sweat , that was placed on hidden cotton pads in the room			1
participants were asked ' if a close friend of family member were gay , i would support their right to having a same - sex marriage ? ' - both with and without a noxious smell present			1
they say the results were shocking			0
' in the research presented here , exposure to a disgusting odor caused greater endorsement of conservative views , including : rejecting gay marriage , restricting sex to marriage , disapproving of the use of pornography , and increased beliefs in @entity113 truth			1
' rejection of gay marriage was a particularly strong response to the disgust - inducing odor , perhaps because of the connection between homosexuality and perceptions of sexual impurity			1
' it is possible that some forms of political conservatism , particularly those related to sex and sexuality , are basic and inherent in some populations and can readily emerge under threatening or taxing conditions			0

team found ' strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage '
used butyric acid , the smell found in rancid butter and sweat , to test theory
those exposed to smell more likely to reject gay marriage , restrict sex to marriage , disapprove of the use of pornography , and believe in @entity113 truth
