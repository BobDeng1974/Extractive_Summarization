a unique species of fish that has remained virtually unchanged for more than 300 million years could reveal the secrets of evolution after scientists decoded its genome for the first time			1
the @entity7 is a sea - cave dwelling , five - foot long fish with limb - like fins			1
it was once thought to be extinct , until a living coelacanth was discovered off the @entity14 coast in 1938			0
staff at the department of @entity17 at the @entity18 of @entity19 display a coelacanth caught by @entity19 fishermen at the coastal town of @entity23 in april 2001 coelacanths today still closely resemble the fossilised skeletons of their 300 - million - year - old ancestors			2
its genome confirms what many researchers had long suspected : genes in coelacanths are evolving slower than other organisms '			1
' we found that the genes overall are evolving significantly slower than in every other fish and land vertebrate that we looked at , ' said @entity38 , a research scientist at the @entity39 and co-first author of a paper on the coelacanth genome , which appears in @entity43 this week			1
' this is the first time that we 've had a big enough gene set to really see that			0
' researchers believe the slow rate of change may be because coelacanths simply have not needed to change : they live primarily off of the @entity14 coast ( a second coelacanth species lives off the coast of @entity55 ) , at ocean depths where relatively little has changed over the millennia			0
' we often talk about how species have changed over time , ' said @entity59 , scientific director of the @entity39 's vertebrate genome biology group and senior author			2
the @entity62 is a sea - cave dwelling , five - foot long fish with limb - like fins this 2008 image by the @entity68 's @entity67 shows an @entity14 coelacanth ( @entity69 ) ' but there are still a few places on @entity72 where organisms do n't have to change , and this is one of them			1
coelacanths are likely very specialized to such a specific , non-changing , extreme environment – it is ideally suited to the deep sea just the way it is			0
' because of their resemblance to fossils dating back millions of years , coelacanths today are often referred to as ' living fossils ' , a term first coined by @entity88			0
however , the team stress the coelacanth is not a relic of the past brought back to life			0
they say it is a species that has survived , reproduced , but changed very little in appearance for millions of years			0
' it 's not a living fossil ; it 's a living organism , ' said @entity38			0
' it does n't live in a time bubble ; it lives in our world , which is why it 's so fascinating to find out that its genes are evolving more slowly than ours			0
' family tree : @entity7 's closest relatives the unique ' living fossil ' has a 300 - million - year fossil record , shown here			1
during the @entity116 geological period , descendants of pelagic lobe - finned fish – like @entity114 – exhibited a sequence of adaptations : panderichthys , suited to muddy shallows ; tiktaalik with limb - like fins that could take it up on to land acanthostega , which had feet with eight digits ichthyostega with limbs			1
descendants also included pelagic lobe - finned fish such as coelacanth species the coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long - debated questions , such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land , including ' lobed ' fins , which resemble the limbs of four - legged land animals ( known as tetrapods )			1
another odd - looking group of fish known as lungfish possess lobed fins too			2
it is likely that one of the ancestral lobed - finned fish species gave rise to the first four - legged amphibious creatures to climb out of the water and up on to land , but until now , researchers could not determine which of the two is the more likely candidate			2
the coelacanth genome has also allowed scientists to test other long - debated questions , such as why it posseses features that look oddly similar to those seen only in animals that dwell on land the coelacanth genome may hold other clues for researchers investigating the evolution of tetrapods			1
' this is just the beginning of many analyses on what the coelacanth can teach us about the emergence of land vertebrates , including humans , and , combined with modern empirical approaches , can lend insights into the mechanisms that have contributed to major evolutionary innovations , ' said @entity185 , a member of the @entity186 and co-first author of the nature paper .			0

@entity7 , a *5ft* fish with limb - like fins , could give a *glimpse* into evolution
first analysis of its genome show it is evolving slower than other animals
breakthrough is helping scientists understand how fish adapted to land
