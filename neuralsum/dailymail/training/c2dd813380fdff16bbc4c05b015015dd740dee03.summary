by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will make nine changes for @entity6 's final @entity5 match against @entity7 on tuesday			1
with their elimination already confirmed ahead of the final @entity12 encounter , the @entity6 boss promised to make changes in @entity14			1
the guessing game began straight after those comments and @entity2 was asked if he could shed any light on the team that would face the group leaders			1
' well , @entity56 will play in goal , ' @entity2 said			1
' the right - back will be @entity59			1
' @entity51 will play centre - half alongside @entity61 , and @entity48 will play left - back			1
' in midfield we will have @entity65 , @entity46 , @entity66 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity52 will play up front			1
' @entity2 insists this is not a team just to give everyone a run out , though , with the @entity6 boss confident they can win the match - one which they need a positive result from to avoid becoming the first @entity6 side to lose all three @entity5 group games			1
checking out : @entity6 's players leave the team hotel in @entity81 for the final time @entity83 to play @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity56 ; @entity59 , @entity51 , @entity61 , @entity48 ; @entity65 , @entity46 , @entity66 ; @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity52			1
' with a very different team and a lot of players who have n't played in the tournament so far , i wanted everyone to go home from this tournament - or at least as many as possible - having taken part and played in a game , not just training , ' he said			2
' we 're very conscious of the fact that our fans are as disappointed and devastated as we are , but they are still here supporting us			2
' we came into the hotel and received a lot of sympathy , kind words from them and we really want to make certain tomorrow night that they see something tomorrow that they can take some encouragement from			2
' and most importantly of all , it 's a top - class international on the biggest stage of all , the @entity5 , so anything else than taking the game very seriously and trying to win the game in its own right would be out of the question			2
' meanwhile , @entity2 has reflected on the pain of @entity6 's @entity5 humiliation			2
' i 've learned how painful it is to build up your hopes , to see a lot of good preparation proved to be to no avail because it did n't get us where we wanted , ' he said			0
' i 've realised that , at this top level in a @entity5 , it 's unforgiving			0
a moment really of sheer misfortune can throw everyone into a realm of despair that you did n't know was possible			0
' tomorrow 's game will tell me a lot about the players			0
it 's been a very tough few days and it 's hard to pick yourselves up for a game that , even if you do well in , serves no purpose			0
' the 100 cap players will find that hard			0
we 'll learn a lot about the others			0
i 've liked what i 've seen around the hotel and in training			0
i 'm now giving them the opportunity , not because i can , but because this is a good team on the field and they can go and win the game			0
i hope they prove me right			0
