at first glance , this copper rockfish may not seem out of the ordinary			1
but the ageing fish does look a little different , after undergoing eye surgery to remove cataracts			1
vets in @entity7 carried out the first - of - its - kind surgery at an aquarium to stop the fish being attacked by others			2
like other animals , rockfishes often encounter some health issues as they age , and this particular fish was found to have developed cataracts in its left eye , according to the aquarium ’s head veterinarian , dr @entity32			1
the fish 's damaged eye was replaced with a taxidermy eye for cosmetic reasons , as well as in a bid to keep it alive in an environment where competition is fierce			1
this is because , without an eye , other fish in the tank would have acted aggressively towards , or ' bullied ' the partially blind fish , assuming it to be sick and weak			2
the fish 's damaged eye was replaced with a fake eye for cosmetic reasons , as well as in a bid to keep it alive in an environment where competition is fierce			1
this image was taken mid-way through the procedure copper rockfish are relatively common from the @entity56 to the @entity58 side of the @entity59			1
they swim in both deep and shallow waters , from 33 to 160 ft ( 10 to 183 metres )			0
the fish come in many colours from reddish dark brown with pale copper blotches along the sides , to a light pink / brown with yellow and white mottling			0
males are known to mature between three and seven years , while females mature between four and eight years			0
they give birth to live young after a gestation period of 10 months			0
the oldest copper rockfish is known to have reached 55 years old , with many living into their 40s			1
they typically reach a maximum length of 23 inches ( 58cm ) and weigh up to 6lbs ( 2.7kg )			0
while the cosmetic surgery may keep the creature alive for further years , it is now partially sighted and at a disadvantage to its completely healthy peers			0
dr @entity32 , and @entity87 ’s head vet , dr @entity86 , fitted the new eye to the bone above the fish ’s eye socket by sewing it on with nylon sutures , and attaching it with titanium clips			2
the copper rock fish was anaesthetised for the procedure			0
another rockfish - a yellowtail - underwent the same procedure and will soon return to the exhibit			0
dr @entity32 said in a blog post : ‘ some people do n’t realise how much effort we give fish			0
’ it is perhaps unlikely that the fish would have survived in the wild without medical attention			0

the copper rockfish had its eye removed after developing cataracts
the damaged eye was replaced with a fake taxidermy eye
it was replaced for cosmetic as well as health reasons , said the vet
*losing* an eye can make fish appear weak , causing other fish to attack it
it *wasfirst* time the surgery has been carried out at @entity22
