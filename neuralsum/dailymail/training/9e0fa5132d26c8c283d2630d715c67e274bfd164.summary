just three in 10 @entity12 babies born in 2012 had both parents born in the @entity5 , and in three @entity12 boroughs , as few as one fifth of babies had @entity5 - born parents			1
across @entity18 and @entity19 , one in three babies had non-uk born parents , according to the @entity22			0
births : one in three babies born in the @entity5 has at least one foreign parents , @entity22 figures show the number of @entity8 people who come to the @entity5 to have children has increased , as the proportion of babies with foreign - born mothers or fathers went from 21.2 per cent in 2000 to 31.4 per cent in 2012			1
