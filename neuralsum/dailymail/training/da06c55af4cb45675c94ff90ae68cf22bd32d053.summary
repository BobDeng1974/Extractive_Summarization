click here to read the match report from @entity2 this attractive @entity4 town had n’t seen an occasion like this for a while			1
@entity9 's reputation for giantkilling as a non-league outfit was well - established but it ’s been a while now since they got one over on a big name			1
with the whole world watching on , was this going to be their day ? enthusiasm in the town centre was much in evidence			0
shop windows were bedecked in anything and everything green and white ; paper pull - out pictures of the boys hoping to topple the mighty @entity27 adorned the window of the estate agent , the butcher , the baker			1
one @entity31 fan holds up a banner mocking @entity27 ahead of the @entity34 third round clash @entity35 ducks down to greet opposing manager @entity36 in the dugout at @entity2 thousands of home fans greeted the @entity27 team coach as it arrived in @entity4 , ( pictured @entity41 ) opportunistic merchants hawked jester hats and half - and - half scarves from supermarket shopping trollies			1
but with the shopping precinct freezing and deserted , it may have been a hard sell			0
at @entity2 , those lucky enough to have secured tickets were giddy with excitement			1
some darted straight for the turnstiles , seeking to secure the best vantage point on the terracing behind the goal			0
the home faithful were in fantastic voice 90 minutes before the start			0
others , in a scrum 20 - deep , waited for the @entity27 team coach to arrive			1
fans from eight to eighty stood around in anticipation , reminiscing and dreaming			2
some might even have long enough in the tooth to recall the last time these two teams met , back in february 1949			0
@entity27 won 8 - 0 on that occasion			1
when the gigantic vehicle rolled up , a hundred camera phones emerged from pockets and a hundred heads popped up , hoping to catch a fleeting glimpse of @entity70 or @entity71			1
sir @entity72 makes his way towards @entity2 after a helicopter ride to watch @entity27 we wanted @entity76 ! @entity9 fans pose with a flag suggesting they were n't quite happy with drawing the @entity79 @entity80 is idolised here by one young fan who does n't appear to rate @entity70 led by sir @entity84 , the @entity27 players filed in			1
saying nothing , heads down , minds focused			0
this was not a day for anything else			0
sir @entity72 chose a rather swifter mode of transport to get here , flying in by helicopter			0
' i saw the back of @entity41 's head , ' said one wide - eyed young fan as the scrum dissipated			1
' well , i saw @entity70 and @entity98 , ' countered his mate			0
the club shop , a portakabin painted green , offered thousands of @entity9 programmes from yesteryear but few , if any , occasions were as prestigious as this			1
the matchday programme , selling like hotcakes at £ 5 a pop outside , was a 96 - page opus , really something special to keep			2
four pages of which were devoted to autographs should any fan be lucky enough to get near the visiting superstars			0
@entity35 , the @entity9 manager and as close as they get to a living legend around here , wanted his players to get close to @entity27 on the pitch - but not too close			1
one @entity27 fan tries to get his fellow supporters going as he stands above the crowd on his chair @entity27 captain @entity70 lines up to take a free - kick with the @entity2 ground packed to the rafters @entity70 leads out @entity27 in front of a bumper crowd while @entity130 captains @entity9 he ordered them not to ask @entity70 , @entity131 for ‘ selfies ’ afterwards or swap shirts , lest it distract from the task in hand			1
there certainly was n’t a welcoming committee once the match started - inside the first minute , @entity137 was hurried into a sliced clearance and @entity9 forward @entity80 clattered into @entity142			1
the first chance fell to home captain @entity144 , @entity27 ’s £ 150m + line - up taken aback			1
unlike those fabled @entity147 of yore , the surface was immaculate and @entity27 soon settled into their familiar passing rhythm			2
every time one of their moves broke down , a hearty cheer arose from the terrace			0
danger averted for a few minutes more			0
but @entity9 were dogged , putting @entity27 under pressure			1
@entity70 and @entity41 were pressed into defensive chores , while @entity157 and @entity80 were left dazed after a clash of heads			2
both resumed wearing thick bandages			0
@entity162 netted a superb volley as @entity27 beat @entity31 2 - 0 on sunday the @entity164 celebrates scoring at @entity2 as @entity27 advanced to the fourth round @entity71 celebrates after securing @entity27 's victory with a late chipped effort in the last minute you lost track of the number of hurried clearances @entity137 and @entity172 put straight out of play			1
@entity175 ’s pace was electric but always in the wrong direction			0
it took the 20 - time champions of @entity179 over half - an - hour to register a shot , a @entity182 daisy - cutter that did n’t trouble @entity183 in net			2
@entity27 ’s first - half funk seemed to be summed up when captain @entity70 hit a basic 10 - yard pass wide left to @entity188 with such force it went out into touch			1
they had been truly lacklustre			0
@entity191 threw on @entity192 and @entity193 at half - time , searching desperately for impetus			2
quite what @entity192 and @entity27 ’s other overseas players made of it all , i do n’t know			2
things could have been even worse for them			0
10 minutes after the break , @entity202 ’s cross fell invitingly for @entity80 to strike one			2
dead centre , not too many yards out , he scuffed it and @entity142 got down			0
they were always likely to pay for it			0
@entity209 , on 63 minutes , @entity162 produced a superb volley on the turn to spark wild celebrations in the away end			2
it was a spectacular goal quite out of keeping with @entity27 ’s performance			2
the home crowd tried to urge a second wind from their now - flagging players			0
the shrill sound of a rattle could be heard above the din			0
@entity9 players look dejected after @entity27 's first goal , but they should be proud of their performance they nearly had an equaliser too , @entity130 heading towards goal at the back post and denied by the unlikely figure of substitute @entity98 , whose introduction had sparked chants of ‘ what a waste of money ’ from the locals			1
@entity27 were able to see out the closing stages in rarely - afforded comfort , especially after @entity98 surged 50 yards to dink the ball over steer and make absolutely sure of their progress			1
‘ we ’re going to @entity242 , ’ sang the @entity27 fans , finally able to relax			1
for @entity9 , it was n’t to be their day			2
but everyone present , from eight to eighty , will never forget the day @entity70 , @entity41 , @entity98 and co played in their backyard			0
and were not given one inch .			0

@entity162 and @entity71 scored goals in @entity27 win
@entity31 beaten 2 - 0 at @entity2 but tested @entity36 's side
fans thoroughly *enjoyed* the occasion with ground packed to rafters
@entity80 missed a great chance for @entity9 in second half
