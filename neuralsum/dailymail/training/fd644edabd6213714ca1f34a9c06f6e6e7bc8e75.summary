by @entity0 @entity1 has banned alcohol advertising and increased restrictions on alcohol sales today in a move likely to anger secularists who accuse the government of having an @entity9 agenda			1
it follows the move earlier this month forbidding female flight attendants at @entity1 ’s national airline from wearing red lipstick and nail polish			2
the sale of alcohol - which @entity9 forbids followers from consuming - will be outlawed from 10pm to 6am			1
alcohol producers will have to place health warnings on packaging			1
the law , which needs presidential approval before coming into effect , also bans alcohol - producing companies from sponsoring events			1
a shopkeeper displays a selection of @entity1 alcoholic drinks - which will be restricted - in his store @entity1 has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of @entity32 , who threw religion out of public life in the 1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt @entity1 from the ruins of the @entity37			1
the powerful military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of @entity1 's secular order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past 50 years , most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a cabinet it viewed as too @entity46			2
the current government , led by @entity48 , is run by the @entity50 @entity49 which has its roots in a banned @entity9 movement			1
he is currently serving his third term as prime minister heading the conservative faith based @entity49 , also known as the @entity49			0
he founded the @entity49 in 2001 upon his release from prison where the former mayor of @entity60 , served ten months for reciting an illegal @entity46 poem during a public address in the province of @entity64			0
as he was banned from public office following the speech including the poem , he could not become prime minister when the party won the general election in 2002 , a ban which was lifted in 2003			0
however , under @entity48 ’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on religious expression , including lifting the ban on head scarves in courts and schools			0
venues where alcohol is sold and consumed can no longer openly display drinks			1
@entity1 is 99 per cent @entity50 , but the @entity83 state and @entity85 candidate has a secular constitution			1
there have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle - class is emerging in @entity1 that wants to practise its religion more freely			2
prime minister @entity48 's ruling @entity49 , which traces its roots to a banned @entity9 party , has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters to relax the state 's control over the expression of religion			0
such restrictions were aimed at reining in @entity46 and improving women 's rights , but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs			0
mr @entity48 , whose wife @entity104 wears a headscarf , has previously said he is committed to secularism , but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs			0
critics of the ruling @entity49 say it is responsible for @entity46 taking root in @entity1			0
mr @entity48 's government denies those accusations			0
it says it is not trying to limit people 's freedoms but aims to bring @entity1 , which wants to join the @entity85 , up to @entity120 standards by tightening restrictions on the sale of alcohol and protecting the young			1
since coming to power in 2002 , the ruling party has taken various measures to limit alcohol consumption , including imposing high taxes on alcoholic drinks			2
national carrier @entity130 has stopped serving alcohol on some domestic flights			2
sales of alcoholic drinks , displayed in a shop in @entity60 above , will be banned from 10pm to 6am @entity1 's prime minister @entity48 has said he is committed to secularism			0
