by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 24 june 2013 @entity2 : 10:26 est , 30 november 2013 with help from a @entity6 astronaut , @entity3 opened in january 1975 at @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
the idea began with @entity8 in the 1960s , but the technology did not exist to bring his vision to life			1
later , when the attraction was given the green light , @entity18 9 and @entity19 astronaut @entity17 joined the @entity3 creative team as a consultant			0
he wanted to make sure that the attraction incorporated information gleaned during @entity6 â€™s early space missions and that the experience felt like actual space flight			0
his valuable input has made @entity3 a favorite at the @entity31 for over 35 years			0
@entity32 did n't get their @entity3 until 1977 , more than two years after @entity7 got theirs in 1975			0
these pictures were taken at the @entity9 park as the ride was being built in 1974			1
today , @entity3 exists at all five @entity7 - style @entity36 around the world			2
it 's only when the lights are off and clever sound and visual effects are brought in that the rides true potential can be realised as close to space as you 'll get : the ride promises riders the chance to ' whiz past shooting stars and celestial satellites during your thrilling space ride - you 'll witness streaking orbs of light , wayward comets and migrant meteors ' how it is today : 38 years on and after numerous refits and renovations @entity3 is as popular and as wild as ever			2

@entity114 built at @entity80 in @entity9 , @entity10 in 1974 and opened the following year
the ride was the second roller - *coaster* at the @entity36 , the first being the ' @entity118 ' which opened in 1959
@entity8 came up with the idea for the ride but after his death in 1966 the project was put on hold *indefinitely*
