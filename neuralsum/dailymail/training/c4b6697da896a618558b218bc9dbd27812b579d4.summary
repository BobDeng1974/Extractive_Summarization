@entity1 victim @entity0 found herself in the middle of the war between @entity4 and @entity5 when she asked @entity5 if she would do a one - on - one interview on @entity7 rather than be questioned by the other co-hosts			1
apparently there was no such thing as a holiday cease - fire behind the scenes at the faltering daytime talk show after @entity4 learned that @entity0 would only appear on the show if @entity5 alone conducted the interview			1
the ex-supermodel had reached out to @entity5 privately to share her experience with @entity1 after seeing the @entity19 winner express endless support for the troubled tv icon on @entity7			1
eventually @entity4 got her way and @entity0 sat sown with all the co-hosts @entity27 had a major melt down recently after a hostile , gum - chewing @entity4 treated her with disdain during an on - air segment discussing the rape allegations against @entity1			1
@entity36 had argued that @entity1 has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true @entity5 knew in advance that @entity0 was going to break her silence			1
' @entity5 is so conflicted on the matter because knows both @entity44 and @entity45			0
though she wants to continue to give @entity44 the benefit of the doubt , she also knows that @entity45 would not lie about something like this if it was n't true , ' a source close to the show tells @entity53			0
@entity5 asked @entity0 to come on @entity7 to discuss her story with their audience			2
the supermodel said she would , but only if she could sit down one - on - one with @entity5 , who passed her desires along to the show 's producers			0
@entity0 says that she went to @entity1 's @entity61 townhouse for an audition and believes that he had drugged her cappuccino ' producers were willing to do whatever @entity45 wanted to get her on the show and agreed to cut out @entity4 as well as other co-hosts @entity27 and @entity28			1
' that infuriated @entity4 , ' the source explained			0
@entity4 hit the roof hearing that @entity0 would appear on @entity7 only in a sit down with @entity5			1
she felt the move was a ' slap in the face , ' as she has been very vocal in her support for the victims and belief that @entity1 is a rapist			0
her passion for the @entity1 story has also created tension with fellow co-host @entity27 , as previously reported by @entity53			0
@entity36 had a major melt down after a hostile , gum - chewing @entity4 treated her with disdain during an on - air segment discussing the rape allegations against @entity1			2
@entity36 had argued that @entity1 has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true			0
@entity36 attempted to defend her opinion to @entity4 but @entity4 was n't having it			0
@entity4 told producers she ' would not stand for that , ' and escalated her complaint to @entity93 , that now oversees @entity7			1
she went to the network level and complained about the decision			0
after pleading her case , @entity93 actually agreed with her and told producers to go back to @entity45 and tell her she had to talk to all of the co-hosts , ' the source detailed			0
the rift between the two hosts of @entity7 is so bad , @entity4 was the only personality from the show that @entity5 did not invite to her annual holiday party ' @entity5 felt that @entity4 had filed the complaint just to undermine her , especially since she has done solo interviews and segments with her friend @entity108 and various child stars she wanted on the show			1
on the view monday , @entity0 told her story about her visit to @entity1 's @entity61 brownstone where she was convinced he drugged her and then threw her into a cab when she she screamed @entity117 realizing what he had done			2
while @entity4 seemed sympathetic , @entity5 could not seem to wrap her head around what @entity0 was saying			2
" i do not think [ that @entity1 raped me ] , no , " replied @entity0 when @entity5 asked if she had been sexually assaulted by @entity1			2
" you 're not sure ? " @entity5 asked , appearing somewhat skeptical of what actually happened.the rift between the two hosts of @entity7 is so bad , @entity4 was the only personality from the show that @entity5 did not invite to her annual holiday party at her home outside the city last @entity130			1
@entity36 and @entity28 attended .			0

former supermodel @entity0 *confided* to @entity5 that she was a @entity1 victim even before the @entity133 *article* appeared
she told @entity5 she would come on @entity7 , but only if @entity5 did the interview alone
@entity5 has been a *staunch* supporter of @entity1 , *unlike* @entity4 who appears *disgusted* by the rape *accusations*
when @entity4 found out she went *ballistic* , appealed to @entity93 brass and *ultimately* got her way
@entity5 felt that @entity4 had filed the complaint just to undermine her
the rift between the hosts is so bad , @entity4 was the only person from the show that @entity5 did not invite to her annual holiday party
