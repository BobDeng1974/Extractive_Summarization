lawyers for @entity17 , 52 , have long argued that he is ' mentally disabled ' and therefore should n't be executed			1
the lethal injection was halted just three hours before it was due to be carried out			1
the state maintains that the defense failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity2 is mentally disabled			2
the death - row prisoner was sentenced to death in 1990 for the lethal beating of fellow inmate @entity26 with a board studded with nails to the distress of other inmates			1
at the time of the murder , @entity2 was already serving a life sentence for the 1986 murder of his girlfriend , @entity35 , who he shot 11 times			2
according to @entity2 's lawyers the judge has now planned a hearing for thursday			1
as reported by the @entity43 , the attorneys for the inmate argued that @entity9 's new @entity44 violates his rights			2
the legislation has come into being after controversy and uncertainty about how the state imports the drugs used for lethal injections			2
the pharmaceuticals are currently the subject of a growing international boycott			2
@entity2 's lawyer @entity55 said he was relieved by the latest decision			0
' at this time , there is far too much we do not know about how the state intends to proceed in this , the most extreme act a government can take against a citizen , ' @entity55 said			0
rally : lawyers and supporters of @entity2 have argued that @entity2 is mentally disabled and therefore should n't be executed			0
this protest on monday in @entity68 called for alternatives to the death penalty in @entity9 this was n't the first time @entity74 scheduled execution has been halted by a challenge to @entity9 's execution method			1
last july , a previous execution date was put on hold by an earlier challenge to the state 's plan to change from a three - drug injection to a single dose of pentobarbital			1
the state @entity85 later authorized the execution to proceed and @entity2 came within 30 minutes of the execution in february			2
it was then halted again so courts could consider claims @entity2 is mentally disabled			0
that stay was lifted in april and the execution rescheduled for monday			1
on february 19 @entity2 was set to be executed at 7 p.m. tuesday night , but shortly before the 11th @entity95 @entity94 granted the stay on claims by @entity2 that he was mentally disabled and thus ineligible for execution , @entity55 said			1
the 11th @entity95 @entity94 issued the ruling for @entity17 as corrections officials prepared his lethal injection for later in the evening			1
reprieve : demonstrators celebrate the stay of execution for @entity2 , condemned for a 1990 killing of a fellow inmate earlier in the day , the state parole board , the @entity107 and the @entity95 @entity85 had all declined to stop the execution			1

clemency : members of the @entity130 prepare to hear a clemency hearing for @entity2 last july - which they turned down a fierce legal battle raged over the death penalty sentence of @entity2 in february			1
despite originally testifying for the state , three doctors who claimed that @entity2 was not mentally disabled dramtically changed their minds			0
@entity2 ’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration , and are doing everything in their power to spare his life			0
authorities said that @entity2 , who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend , @entity148 four years earlier , attacked @entity26 again and again with a nail embedded in a piece of plank			1
@entity26 died of his injuries			1
however , the @entity26 family has publicly declared that they do not agree with @entity2 ’s execution			1
@entity2 ’s lethal injection would have gone directly against the 2002 case , @entity157 , which ruled that @entity157 was ‘ mentally retarded ’ and was not of sound mind , and therefore could not be sentenced to death			1
dr @entity160 wrote in a february affidavit : ‘ having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case , i believe that my judgement that mr @entity2 did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error			0
’ watchful : a corrections officer stands guard with a shotgun on the main road into the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity9 last july after a 30 - day stay of execution was announced for condemned murderer @entity2 the other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of @entity2 in 2000 were ‘ rush jobs , ’ according to the @entity183			1
the state said that @entity2 ’s lawyers failed to prove ‘ beyond a reasonable doubt ’ that the man is mentally disabled			0
outrage : @entity187 was the last @entity9 inmate to be executed in the state ; his 2011 death was highly controversial @entity189 , a spokesperson for the state attorney general ’s office , declined comment , at the time			1
@entity2 was originally scheduled to be executed in june , but the @entity85 allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state ’s changing of execution method			2
@entity2 is among three @entity9 inmates on @entity200 fighting for a court order that would prevent the state from using a drug to execute them without a doctor ’s prescription first			0
@entity2 , along with @entity207 and @entity208 , argue that the @entity9 @entity209 ’ use of the drug without a doctor ’s prescription violates the federal @entity213			0
even if the court finds him mentally disabled , @entity2 would still spend the rest of his life in prison , the @entity183 says			0
the case has stirred a national outcry of those believing @entity2 to be mentally unwell			0
if he is executed , it will be the first carried - out execution in the state since the 2011 death of @entity187			1
at the time , @entity187 ’ conviction and condemnation drew fury , as many believed that @entity187 was the victim of mistaken identity in the murder of @entity231 guard @entity230 in 1989			0
prosecutors and @entity230 's family said they were certain @entity187 was guilty and that justice was served			0
prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words , which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to " continue to fight this fight			0
" @entity187 was notified of the execution date on sept. 7 , and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request			2
