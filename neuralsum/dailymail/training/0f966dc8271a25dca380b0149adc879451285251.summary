by @entity0 published : 20:37 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 20:34 est , 9 november 2012 a furious debate erupted over press regulation yesterday after more than 40 @entity3 called on @entity4 to consider passing laws to police the media			1
in a letter to the @entity13 , senior figures including former foreign secretary sir @entity8 and two former party chairmen , @entity10 and @entity11 , said proposals for a tough system of self - regulation did not go far enough			1
they claimed that statutory regulation of broadcasters had not prevented tv channels from running investigative journalism and exposing wrongdoing			2
@entity23 mps have told @entity4 not to rule out the possibility of statutory press regulation and they suggested the prime minister should keep open the door to some form of state regulation when @entity30 publishes the findings of his inquiry into press ethics later this month			1
they also called for a single standard to assess public interest , which could be ‘ applied independently and consistently ’			2
several of the signatories have faced embarrassing @entity39 scrutiny into their conduct in the past and their intervention provoked a backlash from other @entity22 who described their views as ‘ disappointing and misguided ’			1
@entity48 , chairman of the @entity49 , said : ‘ i would have thought most conservatives would be very wary of any government legislative involvement in the regulation of the @entity39			1
‘ i am opposed to any kind of statutory regulation of the press , including statutory underpinning			1
‘ while i understand the strength of feeling that some action needs to be taken , given the behaviour by sections of the press has been so bad , i think the new regulatory system proposed by the industry , which includes new powers that were not there before , deserves to be given a chance			1
’ mps including @entity69 , right , have called upon @entity4 not to rule out press regulation if it is recommended by @entity30 , left , in his forthcoming report on press standards @entity73 , a @entity23 member of the culture committee , said : ‘ they are trying to have it both ways and you ca n’t			1
it ’s like pregnancy – you ca n’t be a bit pregnant and you ca n’t have partial state interference			1
you either have a @entity82 or you do n’t			2
’ several senior cabinet ministers including education secretary @entity84 , communities secretary @entity85 and chancellor @entity86 are also opposed to state regulation of any kind			1
mr @entity4 is thought to be reluctant to involve the state in press regulation , but is under pressure to accept @entity30 ’s recommendations , which are expected to call for at least statutory ‘ underpinning ’ for a new regulator			1
@entity95 , chairman of the funding body for the @entity97 , told the @entity98 he wanted a form of ‘ muscular ’ self - regulation			2
that would mean a new organisation with the power to launch investigations and levy fines of up to £ 1million			0
a letter from 42 mps including @entity84 , left , and @entity85 , right , warns that a new system being proposed by the newspaper industry ‘ risks being an unstable model destined to fail ’ yesterday ’s letter calling for a ‘ genuinely independent system ’ was co-ordinated by mr @entity4 ’s former press secretary @entity114 and fellow @entity23 mp @entity115			1
mr @entity115 told @entity117 ’s today programme he was ‘ instinctively opposed ’ to statutory press regulation but had changed his mind after hearing evidence of press abuses			1
he said a new regulator would not have to be ‘ invasive ’ , and cited the @entity124 as a possible model			1
@entity126 , editor of the @entity128 magazine , said the prospect of regulation was already having an insidious effect			0
‘ i , as an editor , am getting mps and ministers calling me up to order that i discipline writers who displease them or take articles down in a way that they would n’t have even a year ago because the feeling is going around amongst politicians that , finally , they are going to get their say in how the @entity39 should behave			1
by @entity144 injunction : @entity10 @entity10 is one of several of the newspaper letter ’s signatories to have crossed swords with the @entity39			1
during the 2009 expenses scandal , it emerged she claimed £ 40,000 for cleaning and bills at her £ 2million , 15 - bedroom @entity154 mansion near @entity156			0
the @entity23 politician was also forced to apologise and pay back £ 9,600 of allowances she ‘ inadvertently ’ misused to pay her children ’s nanny			0
mps on the @entity163 said that in 1997 and 1998 – when her son @entity164 was three – she overpaid her nanny £ 4,800 a year in return for secretarial work , meaning her childcare was ‘ cross-subsidised ’			1
her appointment in 2010 as @entity170 prompted questions about her impartiality and apparent willingness to put the interests of business and farmers above those of the consumer			0
her background was as an agricultural scientist and in the early 1980s she was sugar beet commodity secretary for the @entity182 ’ @entity183 , which supports both @entity184 and clone animals			0
in 1989 , she and her husband @entity186 set up a lobbying firm to promote the food and biotech industries			0
following her appointment as secretary of state in 2010 , she revealed she supported the introduction of @entity184 crops ‘ under the right circumstances ’			2

last december , @entity219 , another @entity23 mp to sign the @entity13 letter , compared tabloids to the @entity223 death camp at @entity224 when he gave evidence to a parliamentary committee on privacy			2
sitting alongside actors @entity228 and @entity230 , the mp rejected arguments that newspapers should be given free rein to print stories about the private lives of the famous so that they can remain financially viable			0
the multi-millionaire said : ‘ if the only way a business can stay afloat is by engaging in immoral or unethical behaviour , then that business should either change its model or go out of business			2
‘ no one said that @entity224 should have been kept open because it created jobs			0
’ the mp was appearing before the committee because he had previously obtained a so - called super-injunction preventing the publication of private emails which had been leaked to the @entity39			1
in 2006 , @entity23 mp @entity250 , who signed the letter , was revealed to have had a brief affair with one of the party ’s a-list candidates , @entity253			2
