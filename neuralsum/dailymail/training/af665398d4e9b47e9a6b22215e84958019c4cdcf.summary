by @entity0 for @entity1 the long track of a rectangular , tumbling boulder has on @entity5 has been captured in incredible detail by a space probe			0
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) discovered the trail left behind after a suv - sized rock rolling down a @entity5 hill			1
analysis of the rock 's shadow suggests that the boulder is about 20ft tall ( 6 metres ) and 11.5ft wide ( 3.5 metres )			1
the boulder 's trail down the slope is about one - third of a mile ( about 500 metres ) long			1
the trail has an odd repeating pattern , suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape , according to @entity23 the giant boulder , captured using @entity8 's @entity25 , ended its roll pointed upright			1
@entity23 does n't yet know what dislodged the boulder , but recent speculation suggests it may have been due to a meteor striking one of the larger craters			1
' the boulder 's trail down the slope is about one - third of a mile ( about 500 metres ) long , ' the space agency said			1
' the trail has an odd repeating pattern , suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape			1
' a path resembling a dotted line from the upper left to middle right of this image is the track left by an irregularly shaped , oblong boulder as it tumbled down a slope on @entity5 before coming to rest in an upright position the @entity8 launched in 2005 on a search for evidence that water persisted on the surface of red planet for a long period of time			1
in its survey of the red planet , @entity8 has increased tenfold the number of spots surveyed close - up			2
one of the @entity8 's cameras is the largest ever flown on a planetary mission			2
while previous cameras on other @entity5 orbiters could identify objects no smaller than a bus , this camera will be able to spot something as small as a dinner table			0
in october , @entity8 have a close @entity5 ' close encounters with a comet set to fly by the red planet , giving it a rare opportunity to take images of the space rock			2

@entity86 will pass by @entity5 only 82,000 miles ( 132,000 km ) which would be the equivalent of a comet passing about a third of the distance between @entity91 and the moon			0
the nucleus of the comet wo n't hit @entity5 , but there could be a different kind of collision			0
' we hope to witness two atmospheres colliding , ' explains @entity99 of the @entity100 's @entity101 ( @entity101 )			0
' this is a once in a lifetime event			0
' @entity8 launched in 2005 on search for evidence that water persisted on the red planet			0

the trail was discovered by @entity23 's @entity8 ( @entity8 )
path 's dotted line can be seen from upper left to middle right of image
analysis of the oblong rock 's shadow suggests the boulder is about 20ft tall ( 6 metres ) and 11.5ft wide ( 3.5 metres ) - about the size of an suv
@entity23 does n't yet know what dislodged the boulder , but recent speculation suggests it may have been due to a meteor strike
