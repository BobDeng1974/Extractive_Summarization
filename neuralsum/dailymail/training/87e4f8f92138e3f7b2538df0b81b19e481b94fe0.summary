by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity2 , somewhat resolutely , tells those looking his way in the press room that he can not let his emotions rule what 's best for @entity8 when it comes to @entity10 and @entity11			1
and that cold approach seems the way to go with the @entity8 manager looking more and more prepared to opt for @entity10 in the starting @entity15 against @entity16 over the man 10 years his senior			1
' the best way for me to work is to think pragmatically , ' says @entity2			0
that will be the case should @entity11 , @entity8 's undisputed no 1 for the past decade , be consigned to watch their @entity24 season start from the substitutes bench at @entity26			1
watch scroll down to watch a young @entity10 in action for former club @entity28 winner ? @entity10 is set to start for @entity8 against @entity16 on monday night in the @entity24 training : 22 - year - old @entity10 is 10 years younger than his @entity8 goalkeeper team - mate @entity11 out ? @entity11 looks set to be put on the substitutes bench against @entity16 as @entity2 opts for @entity10 @entity11 , 6ft 5in born : @entity32 , may 20 1982 ( 32 ) 1999 - 2001 : @entity33 ( 27 league apps ) 2001 - 2002 : @entity35 ( 27 ) 2002 - 2004 : @entity36 ( 70 ) 2004 - now : @entity8 ( 326 ) 2002 - now : @entity37 ( 107 ) @entity38 : @entity8 : @entity24 ( 3 ) , @entity42 ( 4 ) , @entity41 ( 2 ) , @entity40 ( 2 ) , @entity39 , @entity43 @entity10 , 6ft 6in born : @entity44 , may 11 1992 ( 22 ) 2009 - 2011 : @entity28 ( 41 ) 2011 - now : @entity8 ( 1 ) 2011 - 2014 : @entity45 ( loan ) ( 111 ) 2011 - now : @entity44 ( 22 ) @entity38 : @entity28 : @entity47 , @entity48 @entity45 : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity43 , @entity51 @entity11 , winner of three @entity24 titles , four @entity53 and a @entity39 with @entity8 , has not faced such a threat in his 10 years at the club			1
@entity10 , though , is not considered your ordinary goalkeeper			0
the 6ft 6 @entity44 - an inch taller than @entity11 for what it 's worth - is regarded as one of the best in the world after helping @entity45 win their first @entity49 title for 18 years and , at 22 , has plenty left to give			2
being stuck between a rock and a hard place has never felt so good for @entity2 who , as blunt as ever , insists he can keep hold of his apparent second - choice goalkeeper			2
we can have two of three best goalkeepers in the world at the club , ' he said			0
we can have @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , so we can have @entity10 and @entity11			2
' i can have @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , yet i can not have two top goalkeepers ? i can			0
@entity8 can as a club , and i can as a manager			0
' the trouble is @entity11 may feel waiting to be brought back into the loop at the age of 32 is a battle not worth waging			0
as a result , @entity89 have been circling @entity11 and @entity8 goalkeeeping coach @entity91 in anticipation of him being dropped			2
the @entity94 club remain open to a loan as it would see them meet @entity51 's strict @entity98 restrictions , although @entity99 and @entity100 are there to create competition			0
@entity2 , who ended @entity10 's three - year loan spell in @entity49 , told his squad the starting xi during training on sunday and has certainly taken this - a ' problem every manager in every club would like to have ' - in his stride			1
insistent : @entity2 believes he can keep both goalkeepers well satisfied at @entity112 back : @entity2 was keen to end @entity10 's three - year loan spell in @entity49 to bring him home to @entity114			1

@entity2 set to pick @entity10 over @entity11 in @entity8 's @entity24 opener against @entity16 at @entity26 on monday night
6ft 6in @entity10 and 6ft 5in @entity11 are competing for a *regular* starting place
@entity2 insists he can *juggle* and keep both happy at @entity112
@entity8 manager says competing for a place between the sticks is the same as other *players* fighting to start in *defence* , *midfield* and up front
@entity10 is not *guaranteed* place in starting @entity15 at @entity16 but is likely pick
