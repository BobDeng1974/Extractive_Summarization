@entity1 owner @entity0 will decide this week if he needs to sack @entity2 to keep the club in the @entity4			1
the @entity1 are one place and one point above the relegation zone following saturday ’s humiliating 4 - 0 home defeat against @entity9 , in which fans attempted to storm the dugout and thousands more left before half - time			1
@entity2 has vowed to fight on despite one win in 12 and no home goal in more than five hours			1
@entity2 cuts a lonely figure on saturday as @entity1 are humiliated 4 - 0 by @entity9 fans show their outrage at the @entity18 as the @entity1 slumped to a record of one win in 12 games striker @entity22 ( right ) had his head in his hands as @entity1 crumbled against @entity9 however , @entity25 understands that senior figures at the club , including sporting director @entity28 , have told @entity0 that @entity2 is the wrong man to take them forward			1
there is also concern at @entity2 ’s touchline behaviour - he was sent off against @entity32 and faces an @entity34 charge for kicking the drinks bucket			1
yet only last year he was hailed a hero after masterminding a dramatic relegation survival			0
@entity25 looks at the reasons behind the disintegrating relationship			0
senior club figures , including sporting director @entity28 , say @entity2 is the wrong man to keep @entity1 in the @entity4 duel at the top when @entity1 sporting director @entity28 set up a deal to bring in @entity46 ’s @entity45 in the summer , @entity2 intervened and let the player ’s agent know the defender would not figure if he signed			1
@entity2 also blocked a move for @entity52 ’s @entity51 , another @entity54 target			2
a source close to the club said : ‘ the relationship between @entity2 and @entity54 is as bad as it can possibly be			1
@entity58 is doing a good job and is respected within the game but fears his own reputation will be damaged if players he signs are then left on the bench by @entity2			2
’ @entity2 blocked a move set up by @entity58 for @entity46 ’s @entity45 , now at @entity66 @entity51 was also a move that @entity2 blocked - now he 's at @entity68 on loan from @entity52 slim @entity70 @entity2 insists he only chooses the team and that transfers are left to @entity54			1
the club hierarchy disagree and point to the arrival of @entity77 pair @entity76 and @entity78 , @entity80 @entity79 and @entity82 @entity81 as players recruited on the say - so of the head coach			2
all four have failed to impress and have each started fewer than 10 league games this season			0
then there is the £ 3million signing of @entity91 addition @entity89			0
the @entity82 was one of the highest earners at the club but left after just six substitute appearances at a £ 1m loss			0
@entity78 ( right ) , along with @entity76 , @entity79 and @entity81 , are players signed on the say - so of @entity2 but who have disappointed ... not to mention the flop signing of @entity89			2
mixed messages @entity2 does not know his best team or formation			0
he started with four central midfielders in the 1 - 1 draw at @entity32 and strikers @entity104 and @entity22 are regularly on the left wing			0
players were miffed when he suggested publicly they were not good enough to carry out his instructions			0
he also upset supporters by claiming they were pining for the ‘ kick and rush ’ days of @entity110 and @entity111			0
@entity1 have drawn 14 matches and the football has been dire , one - paced and unimaginative — they have failed to score in 13 of 29 matches			2
split dressing room @entity2 believes he retains the support of the players and the likes of @entity121 speak highly of him , both in public and private			0
players such as @entity121 ( left ) speak highly of @entity2 , but the dressing room is decidedly split but several players and members of the backroom team were shocked when , during the @entity130 goalless draw at home to @entity132 , first - team coach @entity128 took the team talk			1
2 @entity1 have won just two of their past 16 @entity4 games at the @entity18 — @entity136 ( 3 - 1 ) in october and @entity137 ( 2 - 0 ) in january			1
otherwise it ’s seven draws and seven defeats			0
4 @entity2 ’s side have failed to score in four of their past five @entity4 home matches			1
22 goals conceded at home this season — more than any other @entity4 side			2
12 @entity1 have found the net just 12 times at the @entity18 this season — only @entity9 ( 11 ) have scored fewer goals at home			1
4 @entity150 , @entity1 conceded four first - half goals at home for the first time in the @entity4			1
204 shots this season - the fewest in the @entity4			0
they have also had the most shots ( 467 ) against them			0
meanwhile , the arrest of star player @entity157 on suspicion of sexual relations with an underage girl has been an untimely distraction			0
where are the kids ? @entity164 staff are frustrated that their graduates have played a total of eight first - team minutes this season			0
on saturday morning the under 21s were told to stop training and put on standby for a senior call - up			0
no one was added to the squad and they were annoyed that their session was finished early			0
@entity176 during last month ’s 2 - 0 defeat at @entity178 in the @entity130 , 4,000 fans sang : ‘ @entity2 , it ’s always our fault			1
’ after that game , @entity2 claimed that building a ‘ @entity183 ’ to keep out journalists would improve his relations with the fans			0
on the evidence of saturday ’s sorry showing , the majority of fans will be trying to scale the wall themselves if @entity2 remains in charge			2
fans sang , ' @entity2 , it ’s always our fault , ’ during the 2 - 0 @entity130 defeat at @entity178 summer decisions @entity2 will be lucky to see out the season and the chances of him being at the helm at the start of next year are close to zero			1
@entity25 understands a management team of @entity201 - currently exiled under @entity2 ’s regime - and @entity203 could take temporary charge			2
former player @entity205 is their top target and he would be willing to come in the summer with his contract up at @entity208			1
next up for @entity1 ? a trip to @entity210 on saturday before the small matter of a @entity212			2
@entity205 is @entity1 's top target for their new manager with his @entity208 contract up this summer			1

@entity1 were humiliated 4 - 0 by @entity9 on saturday
@entity2 has vowed he *'ll* fight on despite the @entity1 *horror* run
they have one win in 12 games and no home goals in over five hours
@entity2 's signings have been a *disaster* and club figures are against him
@entity208 's @entity205 is top priority to replace @entity2 next season
