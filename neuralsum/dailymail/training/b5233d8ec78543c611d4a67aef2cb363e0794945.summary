a woman has spoken of the moment she fulfilled her mother ’s dying wish – by having breast implants			1
@entity6 , 55 , from @entity7 , @entity5 had dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years			1
but her wish only came true after her terminally ill mother told her she must have the operation when she died and pledged to leave her enough cash to cover the £ 4,000 operation in her will			1
@entity6 dreamt of having breast surgery for more than 40 years , the 55 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity5 was left the money for an operation after her mother passed			1
she went from a b cup ( left ) to an e cup ( right ) true to her word , when brush maker @entity22 died aged 82 , she left @entity24 more than enough to cover surgery to boost her from a b cup to an e cup			1
so in august last year - 17 months after her mother ’s death , @entity24 went under the knife			1
@entity24 is convinced her mother has since visited her in spirit to give her new bust her seal of approval			1
she believes her new chest is a wonderful way to remember her mother and that the parting gift did n’t just buy her new breasts , but happiness and confidence too			2
@entity24 said : ‘ @entity40 knew how much i wanted surgery but there was always something more important to spend the money on			1
‘ one day i was moaning about it as usual when she sat me down and told me when she was gone there would be enough money for me to get them done and that she wanted me to have the surgery			1
' @entity22 pictured with @entity51 's son - @entity24 and her mother were extremely close until @entity22 's death in august 2013 @entity24 continued : ' @entity40 's words to me were : " you ’ll not have to worry about no bust when me and your dad pop our clogs			1
" ' it was her way of telling that was how she wanted me to spend my inheritance			2
‘ @entity40 was always a very forceful person who liked to be listened to			0
' @entity24 recalls feeling self conscious about her bust from a young age			2
she says : ‘ from the age of 15 i wished for bigger boobs , i did n’t feel very feminine and was envious of women with bigger chests			0
' i kept hoping they would grow but they never did			0
‘ ' @entity40 knew how i felt			0
in fact , i suspect she probably felt the same but in those days you just got on with it			0
’ @entity22 ( left ) told her daughter @entity24 ( right ) about her wish for £ 4,000 of her inheritance to be spent on a breast augmentation after she was diagnosed with life - limiting emphysema as she grew older @entity24 always hoped to be able to one day afford surgery but divorced with a young son , she was diagnosed with @entity84 and unable to work			1
so instead , she resorted to stuffing her bras and buying padded underwear , but always vowing to one day fund a way to have surgery			2
she was turned down for surgery on the @entity91 despite suffering depression triggered by her body insecurities			2
she says : ‘ i felt like a fraud			0
i looked ok in clothes but under the padding i felt there was nothing , it affected my self esteem terribly			0
’ @entity24 ’s yearning for implants was no secret to second husband @entity103 who she married seven years ago or her son , now aged 25			1
@entity24 said : ‘ my whole family knew how much i wanted surgery - i ’d been talking about it for years			1
’ @entity22 pictured with her grandson but it was after lifelong smoker @entity22 was diagnosed with life - limiting emphysema that she sat @entity51 down and firmly told her what she wanted her to do when she died			1
@entity24 said : ‘ @entity40 was far too practical to offer to pay for it while she was still alive			2
but she did n’t mince her words when she told me i must go ahead when she and dad died			0
‘ it meant the world to me that not only was she giving me her blessing , but she was actually making it possible			0
‘ of course i hoped that would n’t be for a long time because i hated the thought of losing my mother , we were very close			0
' but @entity40 was in poor health , relying on oxygen to get through the day and nobody knew how long she had left , so she wanted me to know her wishes			0
about that she was clear			0
’ so with her mother ’s blessing , @entity24 began researching clinics offering breast augmentations and found the transform cosmetic sugery group			1
she said : ' it felt odd researching the operation knowing i would n’t be going ahead until @entity40 and dad both died but @entity40 had told me what she wanted me to do and i could n’t deny the inevitable			0
’ since going from a b cup to an e cup , @entity24 is more relaxed about her appearance and feels clothes fit her better it was another two years before @entity22 succumbed to the disease in march 2012 , passing away from a chest infection just 24 hours after her former miner husband @entity150 died of pneumonia			1
@entity24 said : ‘ @entity40 had fought her condition for so long that i know she died of a broken heart			2
' i was devastated to lose them both and the only comfort i had was that they were together			0
’ she says she took solace in being able to execute and later carry out her mother ’s wishes by forging ahead with plans for surgery			2
she said : ‘ i did a lot for mum and i missed her terribly			0
it was a small comfort to know i was doing something she wanted me to do			0
‘ i imagined her looking down on me and smiling because she had made it possible			0
’ @entity24 even claims that when she was taken into theatre at the @entity172 in @entity173 , @entity174 , she felt her mother ’s presence			1
@entity24 believes her mother @entity22 ( pictured ) would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation she said : ‘ i had n’t experienced anything like it before			1
‘ i felt a warmth and a comfort despite the fact i was going for surgery - i knew it was mum looking after me			2
' the sensation was in my throat , i had never experienced anything like it before , i felt she had come back to watch over me as i fulfilled her wish			0
' knowing what she was like i should think she also wanted to have a good look too			0
’ she recovered well from the surgery and was delighted with her new bust			0
@entity24 says she knows her mother would approve of the way her confidence has grown since the operation			1
she explains : ‘ i ’m more relaxed about my appearance , clothes fit me better and i feel much happier about myself - what mother would n’t want that for her daughter ? ‘ now every time i look in the mirror i think about mum , what a great way to remember her by			2
