by @entity0 @entity1 , 57 , from @entity2 , was n't like other children growing up			1
instead of a pet dog or hamster , the animal - mad child kept a group of very unusual creatures in his parent 's bathroom - a clutch of vampire bats			1
' i would feed them blood from cows or from me sometimes , ' he remembers			2
' i 'd keep blood in the fridge so i could feed them every night			2
' @entity1 , who is famous in @entity2 under the alias ' the @entity22 ' , grew up to become a conservationist and has made it his mission to get the country 's bat species off the endangered list			1
passionate : @entity1 , 57 , from @entity2 , aka the @entity22 of @entity2 , with a @entity29 and he 's met with considerable success			1
in just 30 years , he 's created a network of bat - friendly ' safe caves ' and pioneered conservation techniques so successful , they 've been rolled out to save endangered species all around the world			1
but despite his success , @entity1 says he 's still never happier than when deep underground and surrounded by bats			1
' for most people , caves would sound like a terrifying place , like a place they do n't belong , but caves are my perfect place			0
' there 's little bats , big bats , short snouted , long snouted , little eyes , big eyes , long ears , short ears , every type of bat , ' he continues			1
' in @entity2 and in other places because of what i do , they call me the @entity22			1
all i want is that people get the right information about bats , about how important they are for us , and if that entails them calling me the @entity22 , then so be it			2
' @entity68 , he adds : ' i am the @entity22 ! ' pet : as a child , @entity1 kept vampire bats in his parents ' home , feeding them on animal - and his own - blood hard work : @entity1 has since dedicated his life to saving @entity2 's bats , including the @entity29 tasty : the bat has developed a symbiotic relationship with the tequila producing agave plant @entity1 's journey to becoming the @entity22 of @entity2 began when he was a child , with his remarkably understanding parents agreeing to let him keep vampire bats as pets			1
' that was not easy to withstand , ' he admits , ' and still , my parents let me do that			0
it was fascinating to see these bats feeding and interacting with each other - they take care of each other so well			2
it was a lot of fun			0
' although he no longer keeps vampire bats as pets , he still spends much of his time squelching through caves splattered with guano in a bid to track and conserve a very different type of bat : the @entity29 or @entity107			1
' my first @entity29 came into my hands when i was 15 , ' he remembers			0
' we knew nothing about it and we found out that they were really endangered			2
' we were looking at roosts that were reputed to have many thousands of @entity115 but when we visited , we found only hundreds or none			0
that told us they were in trouble			0
' ever since , @entity1 has made it his mission to save the @entity29 , which plays an essential role in producing @entity2 's most famous export - tequila			1
' as a @entity125 , i 'm proud of my country and part of the @entity125 spirit is a beverage that is called tequila , ' he explains			0
' @entity107 is a very important part of the @entity125 economy and it is owed to bats			0
bats provide pollination to the tequila plant , the agave plant			0
' the agave plant , a relative , bizarrely , of the hyacinth , is found mainly in @entity2 but also in southern parts of the @entity142 and in the rest of @entity144			1
it flowers once every 15 years and relies on the @entity147 for pollination - a process that takes place once a year during the bats ' migration			1
little friend : @entity1 with one of the @entity155 bats his hard work has helped to conserve journey : the @entity147 migrates north to the @entity158 - with @entity1 tracking them the whole way the journey , which takes them 1500km from southern @entity2 to the upper reaches of the @entity158 on the @entity142 - @entity2 border , sees them fly along the ' @entity165 ' - a strip of land sitting between the @entity168 and the @entity169			1
' the link [ between bats and agaves ] has been here for millions of years , ' adds @entity1			1
' agaves rely on the bats to move their pod			0
' bats rely on agaves so that they can survive			0
we could not have tequila if it was n't for the bats			0
' when i drink it , i ca n't help but think about the bats and thank them for the incredible service they give us			2
' although bats were once worshipped in @entity2 in the form of the @entity191 goddess @entity192 who ruled over @entity193 , the arrival of @entity196 colonists who loathed the creatures kickstarted an almost terminal decline			1
when @entity204 was released in 1897 , the association between bats and the forces of evil became even more entrenched			0
' to this day , people are afraid , saying that they are filthy and they are everything bad in the world , ' complains @entity1			2
' that is really not the case			0
' free : @entity1 says despite his successes , there 's more work needed to save @entity2 's bat species in a bid to change public perception of bats , @entity1 has become a one - man pr machine for the animals , travelling the length and breadth of @entity2 in a bid to change peoples ' minds			1
' you can see it in the eyes of people when you talk to them - it suddenly all makes sense , ' he reveals			0
' it all makes sense			0
' their frame of mind changes and they 're bat friends from then on			0
and they propagate the message ; they talk to people in the home , at school , in the office , and suddenly , the message goes snowballing and really changes the panorama for the bats			0
' and for @entity1 , the effort really has paid off			2
thanks to his hard work , the @entity147 population is recovering strongly and has even been taken off the endangered list			1
' this is a clear indication that our work is actually having a good impact on the world , ' he beams , delighted			0
' this is a great day for the @entity29			0
there 's a lot of work to be done but first , it 's time to celebrate			2
' @entity1 and the @entity262 appear on @entity263 : the @entity22 of @entity2 , tonight at 9pm on @entity264			1

@entity1 , 57 , from @entity2 has loved bats since he was a child
kept pet vampire bats in his bathroom and let them drink his blood
is on a mission to save @entity2 's bats and has met with much success
because of his work , the @entity147 is now off the endangered species list
says he 's never happier than when squelching through guano in a cave
