by @entity0 published : 13:31 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 18:08 est , 10 january 2014 touchscreens on smartphones are great most of the time , but sometimes fingers get in the way if you are trying to play a game or look at a detailed document			0
but now inventors in @entity11 have solved this problem by transforming the back and sides of a smartphone case into pressure - sensitive pads to enable the whole phone to react to touch			1
the @entity20 protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case , so they will get a clear view of the screen and effectively increase its area			1
a version for the @entity40 and @entity41 is set to go on sale in summer for $ 99 ( £ 60 )			1
no release date or price for the @entity45 has been announced yet			1
the @entity20 protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case it is designed to be used by gamers , social media butterflies and business people and could even make smartphones easier to use for some people with disabilities , according to @entity55 , the company behind the case			1
the case could be used to take selfies by squeezing its sides , or to play games using the back of the case to execute different manoeuvres			1
it works by using two different types of sensors - capacitive and resistive - which are already used in most mobile device screens			2
the capacitive sensor picks up upon electrical current in an individual 's skin to indicate where a person ’s finger is located , while the resistive sensor detects the level of pressure applied			2
together they make the case as sensitive as a phone ’s screen			1
when a person touches the sensors on the back and sides of the prototype case , the built - in processors in @entity20 translate that data into information that interacts with compatible apps on the smartphone			1
the start - up said the case ‘ gives interaction with apps a whole new variable and dimension that developers and users alike have never experienced before ’			1
it will work with a number of apps – although only three are confirmed at the moment , - with an increasing number set to become compatible as the case becomes more widely adopted after its release			1
the start - up claims it will not drain a phone ’s battery quickly and will protect a phone from ' bumps , drops and scratches '			2
a version of the case for the @entity40 and @entity41 will be the first to go on sale , with a larger type for the @entity120 following closely behind			1
owners of an @entity122 or @entity123 will be the next to get the cases and the company said it might develop them for use with @entity128 and @entity129 smartphones too			0
an @entity40 case called @entity131 that comes with a 650k volt electrode , is capable of ' halting an aggressive adult male , ' according to the firm that makes it			0
the case is fitted with a safety catch to make sure the electrode does n't accidentally activate in a pocket , for example			0
the electrode is also protected by a cover			0
in addition to being used as a weapon , @entity131 has its own battery and can charge a phone for up to twenty hours			0
the case can keep up to 10 per cent of this power in reserve to make sure that the stun gun can be used in emergencies , even if the phone 's battery is dead			0
the @entity131 case is sold in the @entity153 , where it is legal in 42 of the 50 states			0
stun guns can only be bought by over 18s without a felony record and must also only be bought for self defence			0
stun guns are illegal in the @entity45 and considered to be firearms , which can carry up to a five - year jail sentence			1
@entity131 does not offer international shipping			0
to discharge the stun gun , users need to pull the top corner of the case back and push the safety switch up			2
to fire the gun , users must press and hold the blue button			0
once the electrode is no longer needed , users must pull down the safety button and replace the corner of the case so the device is n't accidentally activated in their pocket			0
the original @entity178 case went on sale in the @entity153 last year , and the firm recently unveiled a redesigned @entity40 and @entity41 model at @entity34			2
a version of the case for the @entity40 and @entity41 ( pictured ) will be the first to go on sale , with a larger type for the @entity120 following closely behind			2
