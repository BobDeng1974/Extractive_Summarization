for almost 20 years , @entity0 was the most popular author in @entity2 libraries , with more copies of her novels borrowed than any other writer			1
but she has suffered a massive drop in popularity – not even managing to make the top ten most popular authors of the past nine years			2
out with the old : @entity0 's popularity has waned and in the latest annual charts , for 2010 - 2011 , she ranked a lowly 147th in the list of most borrowed writers , as readers find her work – inspired by her illegitimate childhood and grinding poverty in the @entity17 – increasingly irrelevant			1
instead they are opting for ‘ grittier ’ crime novels by authors such as @entity20			1
ms @entity0 ’s spectacular fall from popularity is detailed in figures that have been obtained from the @entity24 , which distributes library royalties to authors			2
she made the top 20 authors in only three of the past nine years , with around 3.5million of her titles lent over that time			2
it is a far cry from 1997 , when nine of the top ten most popular library books were hers			0
the figures are the second blow to @entity0 ’s reputation in less than a year , after @entity36 decided to drop its ‘ outdated ’ @entity38 tourist slogan			1
@entity40 mayor @entity39 , 64 , said @entity0 ’s popularity was on the wane as a new generation of readers found it hard to relate to her			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s something we should be too upset about because she had her day and she brought history to life			0
' i think people my age could actually connect with the stories in a certain way , but times have changed and people have moved on			0
‘ her books tended to be the same story every time and they were based on certain types of characters , such as the strong woman bringing up her family against the odds			0
' she had a very hard life , partly because she was illegitimate , but that is a stigma people simply ca n’t relate to any more			0
’ @entity0 was the most borrowed author in @entity2 for 17 consecutive years from 1984 to 2000 , but she fell off the top ten in 2005			1
and from 2002 to 2011 , she ranks no 15			0
a new chapter : authors such as @entity20 have overtaken @entity0 in the popularity stakes dr @entity72 , registrar of the @entity24 , said : ‘ i suspect a couple of things are going on			1
her death in 1998 means there are no new books and our experience is that if you are not getting books on to the shelves , then popularity fades away			0
top ten : the most borrowed authors ‘ another reason is a change of taste			1
we have seen the growing popularity of what we might call gritty crime thrillers , both @entity93 and @entity94			0
authors like @entity20 are mopping up at the moment			1
‘ it was my mother ’s generation who liked the @entity0 books			2
there is a slight datedness about them now			0
’ @entity20 , the @entity94 thriller writer , has topped the annual list for the past five years			1
the author , who signed a reported $ 150 million ( £ 95 million ) publishing deal in 2009 , has achieved 14 million loans since 2002			0
he has replaced @entity107 , the children ’s writer and creator of the @entity111 stories as @entity2 ’s most borrowed author – at the top of the annual list , although over the past nine years as a whole , @entity114 narrowly takes the top slot			2
@entity118 author @entity117 is a noticeable absentee from the list of the most borrowed authors			1
dr @entity72 said that was probably because she had written only a handful of titles			0
@entity2 ’s 4,500 libraries make about 300 million loans a year and @entity2 - based authors receive an average of 6p a time , capped at £ 6,600 a year			0
thriller king : @entity20 has is more ' relevant ' than @entity0			2

ranks 147 in the list of most borrowed writers
readers opting for ‘ grittier ’ crime novels by authors such as @entity20
the tales are too ' outdated ' for new generation of readers
