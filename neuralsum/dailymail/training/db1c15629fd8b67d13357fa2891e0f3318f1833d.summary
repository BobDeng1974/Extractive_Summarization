@entity0 was thrilled to hand @entity2 supporters the perfect @entity4 gift after firing the club to a fourth successive derby victory at @entity7			1
the 27 - year - old winger struck with seconds of normal time remaining at @entity10 to silence the home crowd and condemn the @entity12 to a third consecutive home defeat by their arch - rivals			1
@entity0 and his team - mates celebrated on the pitch in front of the travelling fans high in the stand at the @entity21 long after the final whistle as the bragging rights remained on @entity24			2
@entity0 proved @entity2 's matchwinner in sunday 's 1 - 0 @entity27 win at @entity7 @entity0 ( left ) scored the only goal of the game in the final few minutes with a sweet left - footed strike he said : ' we 've given them something to make their @entity4 even more special now			1
it 's great to win four - in - a - row			2
whatever happens now , we 're in the history books as the team who did it			0
' i 'm not sure how many more times that will happen			0
' if @entity2 had to wait to prolong @entity7 's agony , it was no less deserved as they created a series of chances to win the game long before they did			1
indeed , @entity0 himself was guilty of a bad 77th - minute miss , although head coach @entity52 revealed after the game that he was about to substitute the @entity54 international until he saw him get in behind the home defence to create that opportunity			2
@entity52 's change of mind was richly rewarded when the midfielder started and finished the game 's decisive move and fired past keeper @entity63 from substitute @entity65 's lay - off , his third goal in as many visit to @entity10 '			1
@entity0 's ( left ) goal means @entity2 have won the last three @entity70 derbies at @entity10 @entity0 said : ' i 've done well there in recent years and it was a great highlight			1
to be honest , the chance i missed , i should have scored			0
' we had so many opportunities to kill the game , but we stuck with it and luckily i got another chance and put it away			0
' it was a little bit end - to - end in the second half and they pushed their attacking players on , but i thought we always looked a threat on the counter-attack			0
' @entity7 were intent on restoring local pride and started at break - neck speed , buoyed by the visitors ' misfortune in losing specialist full - back @entity90 to a calf injury during the warm up			2
with skipper @entity94 asked to line up at left - back it meant that @entity52 's rearguard comprised of four central defenders and the @entity2 found themselves defending deep and in numbers and under extreme pressure			1
but they survived and eventually eased themselves into the game , and with @entity104 and @entity105 orchestrating and @entity106 and @entity107 menacing , they forced their way into the ascendancy			0
@entity0 praised @entity2 captain and @entity94 who performed diligently at left back on sunday @entity106 was denied by the crossbar and @entity107 by young keeper @entity63 before the break , while both @entity105 and @entity0 might have scored			1
@entity114 had to pull off stunning saves to keep out goal - bound shots from @entity117 and @entity118 , and his heroics were ultimately embellished by @entity0 's last - gasp intervention			1
the win was just @entity2 's third in the @entity27 so far this season and ended a frustrating run of draws , and they will hope to build upon it on @entity125 when struggling @entity127 head for the @entity128			1
@entity0 said : ' it 's been coming , i think			2
we have played quite well in games , but just do n't seem to have won them or struggled to score goals			0
but you only need one and we did that			0
' @entity7 had had a tough week with a young keeper in goal			0
we tried to put him under pressure and i think we were quietly confident going into the game thinking we could win again			0
' it made it difficult with @entity90 pulling out - i do n't think @entity144 has played there for 10 years - but they did n't cut us open as much as they 'd have liked and we looked solid			0

@entity2 won 1 - 0 away at bitter rivals @entity7 on sunday
@entity0 's late goal was their third successive win at @entity10
