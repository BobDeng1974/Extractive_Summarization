by @entity0 @entity1 leaves @entity2 in @entity3 in april 2010 wife killer @entity1 has lost his bid to overturn his conviction almost four years to the day that he was sentenced for murder			1
@entity1 was jailed for at least 24 years in september 2010 after he was found guilty of murdering his wife @entity7 , 49 , by pushing her off a 50 - metre cliff in the @entity10 , south of @entity3 , in march 2005			1
the former policeman , soldier and paramedic claimed his wife accidentally fell during their camping trip after leaving their tent to go to the toilet			0
but the crown said @entity1 preyed on the somewhat naive middle - aged country woman and six months after they were secretly married , killed her to get her money			2
earlier this year @entity1 appealed the conviction on four grounds , including that the ' prejudicial ' evidence of controversial retired physics professor @entity28 should not have been allowed			2
associate professor @entity28 was also used by the crown during the trial of @entity31 , who was convicted of spear - throwing his girlfriend @entity34 off @entity35 in @entity3 in 1995			2
this conviction was later overturned on appeal in 2012 with the court finding that @entity39 's crucial evidence was unsophisticated and lacking impartiality			0
on monday , the @entity41 found there had also been a miscarriage of justice in relation to @entity39 's evidence at @entity1 's trial			0
but chief justice @entity48 dismissed the other three grounds of the appeal , saying @entity1 's conduct during the fatal camping trip and his behaviour before and after his wife 's death meant he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that @entity1 deliberately pushed her off the cliff			1
@entity1 was jailed for at least 24 years in september 2010 after he was found guilty of murdering his wife @entity7 ( pictured ) , 49 , by pushing her off a 50 - metre cliff in the @entity10 , south of @entity3 , in march 2005 the former policeman , soldier and paramedic claimed his wife accidentally fell during their camping trip after leaving their tent ( pictured ) to go to the toilet @entity1 , he said , had ' little or no affection ' for his wife , had described her in derogatory terms to others , had taken steps to conceal their marriage and did not attend her funeral			1
therefore he said no ' substantial injustice ' was caused by the erroneous admission of @entity39 's evidence and that @entity1 's appeal should be dismissed			0
during his trial , the jury heard @entity1 was a debt - riddled @entity77 who , by the time his wealthy wife died , had gained $ 255,000 from the marriage and expected a further $ 127,000 to follow after her death			1
a week after becoming a widower , @entity1 took a lover on a luxury holiday in @entity85 and two weeks later proposed to her			0
@entity1 's earliest release date is in may 2034			0
