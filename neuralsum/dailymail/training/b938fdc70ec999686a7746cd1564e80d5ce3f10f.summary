@entity0 , pictured with his partner , @entity1 , was allegedly killed by his son @entity2 after a row over money a man killed his 25 - stone father and then ' carefully ' dismembered his body and ' neatly packaged ' the body parts in plastic storage boxes which he used as a television stand , a court has heard			1
@entity2 used a @entity13 knife and hacksaw to cut up the body of his father , 48 - year - old @entity0 , at the flat they shared in @entity19 , @entity20			1
the 28 - year - old is on trial at @entity23 accused of the murder of his taxi - driver father , which he denies			1
the jury was shown photographs of the flat , including plastic boxes containing body parts which were stacked with a television placed on top			0
they were also shown the filing cabinet with the box containing mr @entity0 's head inside			0
@entity37 , prosecuting , told the jury that @entity2 killed his father on may 16 last year , following an argument over money			1
he said that a neighbour who lived below the pair noticed a ' pink liquid ' was dripping through the ceiling of his bathroom			1
the prosecutor said that this was diluted blood as @entity2 cleaned up the crime scene with a floor and a steam cleaner which he went out to buy after he killed his father			2
mr @entity54 said : ' mr @entity0 was a large man , 6ft 5in , he weighed in excess of 25 stone in weight , hence i say when his body was cut up and dismembered , it would have taken time and effort			2
armed with a @entity13 knife , small hacksaw and a saw , it would have been a messy business			0
' he added that the body parts had been ' packaged neatly ' in the boxes			0
the prosecutor said that @entity2 attempted to cover up the killing and had created a ' things to do ' list including paying the rent on the property , which was his first action after the incident			0
he also used his father 's mobile phone in the following weeks in an attempt to pretend that he was still alive			2
after paying the rental company at their offices in cash , he then went to a store and purchased the cleaning equipment			0
the neighbour who spotted the dripping blood had previously heard an argument coming from their flat in which the deceased said : ' do you expect me to keep subsidising you for the rest of my life ? ' mr @entity0 's dismembered body was found at the pair 's home in @entity19 after a neighbour saw liquid dripping through his roof when he went to investigate the liquid , the defendant answered the door and was described as ' very calm , just normal , very collected , there was nothing to say he had just had a fight with his dad '			1
mr @entity54 said that @entity2 's actions meant that his father 's body was not found until a month later , on june 17 , after his father 's partner , @entity112 , reported him missing to police because he had stopped replying to text messages			1
she believed he had been visiting a friend in the @entity118			0
mr @entity54 said : ' @entity119 attended the flat , they noted strong smells and flies , alive and dead , in the hallway leading up to the property			0
' they entered and they found mr @entity0 within the bedroom area , his body had been dismembered , that is cut up , deliberately and carefully and placed in plastic storage boxes together with items of clothing			2
' mr @entity0 's head had been removed , cut off , and was found within another box within a filing cabinet in the bedroom			2
' @entity2 spent hundreds of pounds drinking and socialising in @entity136 after killing his father , a jury at @entity23 ( pictured ) was told the prosecutor added : ' in one of the boxes was a @entity13 knife with a relatively small but sharp blade , a saw and a small hacksaw - the tools , the @entity147 say , which were used to kill and cut up the body of mr @entity0			1
' mr @entity54 said that @entity2 took at least £ 7,750 in cash belonging to his father and on may 22 went to visit friends in @entity136 where he spent up to £ 300 ' drinking , eating and socialising ' , all the time sending text messages purporting to come from his dead father			0
he then used more money stolen from his father to pay for a weekend with his mother , who was separated from mr @entity0 , to stay at a hotel in @entity158 for a vegan weekend			0
when he was later arrested at his mother 's home in @entity161 , @entity2 said to police : ' is this a joke ? ' @entity2 denies murder but admits manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility			1

@entity2 killed @entity0 after row over money , court hears
the son then ' cut up his father 's body and sent texts from his phone '
@entity2 , 28 , then went on *spending* spree , prosecutors claim
police investigated after pink liquid dripped through neighbour 's ceiling
@entity2 admits manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility
but he denies murder at trial at @entity23 today
