by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:02 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 2 january 2013 prince @entity2 is a ' jackal ' intent on killing innocent people while ' drunk ' in @entity6 , one of the country 's feared warlords has said			1
@entity10 , who is listed as one of the world 's most wanted terrorists by the @entity14 , launched the verbal attack as the @entity16 spent @entity17 in the war - torn country			1
@entity10 , who was once prime minister of @entity6 , said @entity2 is being ' hunted ' by the @entity20 and in one assault on a base was forced to ' find a hole to hide himself '			1
the jihadist also promised that until @entity28 ' invaders ' leave in 2014 they will be attacked and murdered with even greater intensity			2
' @entity30 ' : prince @entity2 , who is currently in @entity6 , has been accused of killing innocent people while drunk , by a notorious warlord exiled : from his hideaway on the @entity6 / @entity33 bordwer @entity10 said the @entity16 is being hunted @entity2 is currently on a four month long deployment to @entity6 serving his second tour of duty as gunship co-pilot			1
@entity10 also mocked @entity28 's involvement in the ' cruel conflict ' to please ' @entity14 generals '			1
' the @entity28 prince comes to @entity6 to kill innocent @entity6 while he is drunk			1
he wants to hunt down @entity42 with his helicopter rockets without any shame , ' he said in an interview with the @entity46			0
' but he does not understand this simple fact that the hunting of @entity6 lions and eagles is not that easy ! jackals can not hunt lions			0
' it seems that some @entity28 authorities still dream about the times of the eighteenth and nineteenth century and they want their ambassador to be treated like a viceroy and their prince to go out in uniform to hunt for human beings and play the satanic role that they used to play in the past			2
' the warlord - who is the founder and leader of the @entity66 political party and paramilitary group - also referenced the attack on the base where @entity2 was stationed in october			2
speaking from his hideaway on the @entity6 / @entity33 border , he added : ' during the @entity42 attack on the @entity14 base the @entity41 saw that he was the one about to be hunted and was searching for a hole in which to hide himself			1
' @entity75 : @entity2 is on his second tour of @entity6 and flew into @entity77 in september scathing attack : @entity10 , who is branded a terrorist by @entity14 , says @entity2 is being hunted and in one attack was forced to find a hole to hide in two @entity14 @entity82 were killed in the attack before @entity85 soldiers led by @entity28 troops killed 18 of the attackers and took one prisoner			1
@entity89 was the celebrated and fearsome force credited with ending the @entity92 occupation of @entity6 in 1989			0
however , as one of the most deadly of the @entity42 leaders , he was also accused of dedicating himself to ' fighting other @entity42 rather than killing @entity92 '			0
at the heart of his political views is that he strongly opposes the presence of foreign troops in his country and that all efforts should be made to remove them by force			0
he has also adopted extreme @entity105 views and was prime minister of afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996			0
the former @entity107 is accused of being behind an attack that killed 25,000 civilians in the 90s , for example			0
he later fled to @entity112 after the @entity20 took control of the country			0
an enemy of current @entity6 president @entity116 , he lives somewhere near the country 's border with @entity33 and has been accused of having links to @entity120 and @entity121			2
the @entity20 rushed to claim a propaganda victory , saying that @entity2 , who is an @entity123 helicopter pilot based at @entity124 , was the intended victim of the attack			2
qari @entity126 , the @entity20 ’s spokesman , said : ' we attacked that base because prince @entity2 was also on it and so they can know our anger			2
thousands more suicide attackers are ready to give up their lives for the sake of the @entity135			0
' @entity2 ’s arrival at @entity124 in september , where he will serve with @entity137 , @entity138 came four weeks after a storm over his antics in @entity141			0
pictures emerged of the prince naked during an alcohol - fuelled game of strip billiards in his £ 5,100 - a - night suite at the luxurious @entity148			0
although he was said to be letting off steam ahead of his deployment to @entity6 , the third - in - line to the throne received a stern dressing - down by senior officers for his role in the frolics			2
@entity157 , who has been labelled a ' war criminal ' by president @entity116 's government in @entity161 , has already seen @entity6 torn apart by fighting after playing an important role during the civil war			1
but his co-operation and the involvement of his political party is still seen as vital to ensure the acceptance of a new democratically - elected government			0
fun : before his current tour @entity2 went to @entity141 with his friends to let his hair down and got into several scrapes , including a notorious game of naked billiards vegas : prince @entity2 partied hard on his trip to @entity14 , before the public knew he was on the way back to war but while @entity10 has called for a ' peaceful transition of the government ' to democracy , he warned that the country faced plunging into anarchy following the withdrawal of @entity28 troops in 2014			1
he remarked that the current situation in @entity6 resembles the time shortly before the withdrawal of @entity92 soldiers in the 1980s			0
but while he insisted the country may be plunged into chaos following @entity28 troops leaving the country , he also insisted withdrawal of ' all foreign forces ' before his party would participate in the 2014 presidential elections			1
the government has been forced into a response to @entity10 's rant			1
a @entity200 ( @entity200 ) spokesman said : ' the suggestion that any member of the @entity204 deployed on operations operates under the influence of alcohol is simply absurd - not least because the consumption of alcohol by @entity28 military personnel is not permitted under any circumstances while deployed in @entity6			1
' @entity28 troops deployed and remain in @entity6 to protect our national security by removing what was a safe haven for international terrorism			1
' 2012 : last year was a big one for the @entity41 , as he was also a central part of the jubilee celebrations with his brother @entity219 and his wife @entity220 visit : prime minister @entity221 had a @entity17 dinner in @entity77 but @entity2 's location is being kept secret			0

@entity10 is one of @entity14 's most - wanted global terrorists
' the @entity28 prince comes to kill innocent @entity6 while he is drunk , ' he said
@entity2 is being ' hunted ' , he claims , and hid in a hole when he was attacked
@entity16 is on his second tour of the war - torn nation as a helicopter co-pilot
@entity28 will withdraw all its troops from the country in 2014
@entity200 calls @entity10 's comments ' absurd '
