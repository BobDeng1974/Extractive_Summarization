by @entity0 published : 03:43 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 19:23 est , 10 august 2012 as they trudged away from the disastrous @entity4 campaign , the thoughts of @entity2 fortunate enough to have survived inevitably turned to loved ones at home			1
but one of the @entity9 soldiers had something else on his mind			2
among his belongings was a native tortoise that he had found comfort in caring for as artillery shells exploded around him and bullets whistled past			2
veteran : blake the tortoise was brought back to @entity20 by a soldier from the @entity9 nearly 100 years ago			1
he is now looking for a new home so when it came to heading thousands of miles back to @entity20 on a troop ship in 1916 , the pet came too			1
what became of the soldier , known only as mr @entity29 , remained unclear yesterday except that he died many years ago			1
but @entity31 , as the spur - thighed tortoise is called , is still going strong 96 years later			1
the story has only now come to light after his current owner , @entity34 , felt she was no longer able to care for him properly because he was getting a bit ‘ geriatric ’ and asked an animal charity to help			2
still fit : @entity38 ( pictured with @entity31 ) , general manager at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41 , said the tortoise is still fit and lively despite his age long life : @entity31 has outlived his first owner by more than 30 years ancient : tortoises often outlive their human owners - with some reaching up to 150 years of age the retired office manager , 67 , from @entity51 , @entity41 , took possession of @entity31 in 1983 after advertising for a female tortoise she could use for breeding			1
‘ a mrs @entity55 contacted us and said she had a female tortoise she was willing to let us have , ’ she said			0
‘ when we went to her house we saw it was male but we decided to take it anyway			0
while we were there she told us where the tortoise had come from			0
’ the sun - baked peninsula of @entity4 in @entity64 takes its name from an ancient @entity67 word meaning ‘ beautiful city ’			1
but it became hell on earth during the bloody campaign between april 1915 and january 1916			0
hell : the @entity4 campaign against @entity64 claimed the lives of thousands of @entity77 soldiers bloodbath : the campaign ended in disaster for the @entity81 after their troops came under heavy artillery fire from @entity86 forces the @entity81 launched an attack on @entity4 in the @entity88 in april 1915 during @entity9 , in a bid to capture the @entity86 's capital , @entity91			1
troops quickly became bogged down on beaches under devastating @entity64 artillery fire			1
the assault was eventually called off in january 1916 after almost 400,000 casualties on both sides			0
there were nearly half a million casualties during the campaign , according to the @entity102 @entity101 , and many more soldiers became sick due to unsanitary conditions , especially from enteric fever , dysentery and diarrhea			0
the @entity20 - @entity109 operation was intended to capture @entity110 , now @entity91 , and open a sea route to @entity112			0
the @entity64 prevailed and 400,000 lives were lost on both sides			1
mrs @entity34 , who has kept more than 20 tortoises over the years , said the ideal place for @entity31 – so called because he lived with the @entity117 in @entity118 , near @entity119 – would be his native home in @entity64			1
there would be problems getting him through customs , however , so a sunny @entity20 garden with plenty of weeds and wildflowers to munch on would be the next best thing			0
a warm , dry shelter , such as a greenhouse or utility area with @entity134 lamp , would also be needed in cold weather			0
wherever he ends up , he does have one other need – he is still mating despite his advancing years			2
‘ he ’s truly astonishing , ’ said mrs @entity34			0
@entity38 , who is temporarily looking after @entity31 , said : ‘ he is really quite fit and raring to go			0
the only problem is that he has cataracts , which have proven difficult when he meets a female tortoise he quite likes			0
’ @entity141 of the @entity142 in @entity143 , near @entity119 , which is trying to find him a permanent home , said : ‘ many tortoises can live well into their hundreds , meaning they often outlive their owners			2

@entity150 brought home to @entity41 in a soldier 's *kitbag* from @entity64
outlived first owner by more than 30 years
*healthy* *reptile* managed to father again just a year ago
