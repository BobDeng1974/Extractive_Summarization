by @entity0 after decades of historians denying that the @entity3 sacrificed their children as described in @entity6 accounts , a new study claims to have found ‘ overwhelming ’ evidence that the ancient civilisation really did carry out bloodthirsty practice			1
@entity11 parents ritually sacrificed young children as an offering to the gods and laid them to rest in special infant burial grounds , according to a team of international researchers			2

the practice could hold the key to why @entity30 was founded in the first place			1
babies of just a few weeks old were sacrifice			0
dedications from the children 's parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains , ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had ' heard my voice and blessed me '			0
an @entity47 professor said that people might have sacrificed their children out of profound religious piety , or a sense that the good the sacrifice could bring the family or community as a whole outweighed the life of the child			1
we think of human sacrifice as a terrible practice because we view it in modern terms , but people looked at it differently 2,500 years ago			2
the backlash against the notion of @entity11 child sacrifice began in the second half of the 20th century and was led by scholars from @entity72 and @entity73 - the very countries in which tophets have also been found			1
it was first documented by @entity6 and @entity76 writers who seemed more interested than critical of the unusual practice			0
a collaborative paper by academics from institutions across the globe , including @entity47 reveals that previous well - meaning attempts to interpret these ancient burial grounds , called tophets , simply as child cemeteries , are misguided			1
instead , the researchers think the practice of child sacrifice could even hold the key to why the civilisation was founded in the first place			1
the research pulls together literary , epigraphical , archaeological and historical evidence and confirms the @entity6 and @entity76 account of events that held sway until the 1970s , when scholars began to argue that the theory was simply anti-carthaginian propaganda			2
' it 's becoming increasingly clear that the stories about @entity11 child sacrifice are true			1
this is something the @entity76 and @entity6 said the @entity3 did and it was part of the popular history of @entity11 in the 18th and 19th centuries , ' said dr @entity107 , of the university ’s @entity108 , who an author of the paper , published in the journal @entity114			0
' but in the 20th century , people increasingly took the view that this was racist propaganda on the part of the @entity6 and @entity76 against their political enemy and that @entity11 should be saved from this terrible slander , ’ she said			0
the city - state of ancient @entity11 was a @entity122 colony located in what is now @entity72			1
it operated from around @entity125 until @entity126 , when it was destroyed by the @entity76			0
the @entity129 baths are pictured in @entity11 , which are listed as @entity130 by @entity131 ' what we are saying now is that the archaeological , literary , and documentary evidence for child sacrifice is overwhelming and that instead of dismissing it out of hand , we should try to understand it			1

@entity76 writers tended to describe child sacrifice as more of an eccentricity than a crime			1
@entity162 is illustrated in sacked @entity11 dr @entity163 said : ' people have tried to argue that these archaeological sites are cemeteries for children who were stillborn or died young , but quite apart from the fact that a weak , sick or dead child would be a pretty poor offering to a god and that animal remains are found in the same sites treated in exactly the same way , it 's hard to imagine how the death of a child could count as the answer to a prayer			2
' it 's very difficult for us to recapture people 's motivations for carrying out this practice or why parents would agree to it , but it 's worth trying			0
' perhaps it was out of profound religious piety , or a sense that the good the sacrifice could bring the family or community as a whole outweighed the life of the child			2
' we have to remember the high level of mortality among children – it would have been sensible for parents not to get too attached to a child that might well not make its first birthday			0
' dr @entity163 said that we think of human sacrifice as a terrible practice because we view it in modern terms , but people looked at it differently 2,500 years ago			0
' indeed , contemporary @entity6 and @entity76 writers tended to describe the practice as more of an eccentricity or historical oddity – they 're not actually very critical , ’ she said			0
' we should not imagine that ancient people thought like us and were horrified by the same things			0
' the backlash against the notion of @entity11 child sacrifice began in the second half of the 20th century and was led by scholars from @entity72 and @entity73 - the very countries in which tophets have also been found			1
dr @entity163 said : ' @entity11 was far bigger than @entity225 and for many centuries much more important than @entity227 , but it is something of a forgotten city today			0
babies were sacrificed by the @entity3 at tophets			0
dedications from the children 's parents to the gods are inscribed on slabs of stone above their cremated remains , ending with the explanation that the god or gods concerned had ' heard my voice and blessed me ' a tophet in @entity246 , @entity232 is pictured ' if we accept that child sacrifice happened on some scale , it begins to explain why the colony was founded in the first place			1
' perhaps the reason the people who established @entity30 and its neighbours left their original home of @entity256 – modern - day @entity257 – was because others there disapproved of their unusual religious practice			2
she explained that child abandonment was common in the ancient world and human sacrifice is found in many historical societies , but child sacrifice is relatively uncommon			2
‘ perhaps the future @entity3 were like the @entity267 leaving from @entity268 – they were so fervent in their devotion to the gods that they were n't welcome at home any more , dr @entity163 said			0
' dismissing the idea of child sacrifice stops us seeing the bigger picture			2

*bodies* of children were buried in special cemeteries called tophets
