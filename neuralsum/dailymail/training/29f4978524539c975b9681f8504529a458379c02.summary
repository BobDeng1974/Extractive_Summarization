by @entity0 @entity1 was the youngest son of @entity2 and @entity3 , both 70			2
he died from brain cancer in may this year , almost two years after being diagnosed when @entity1 was diagnosed with brain cancer two years ago he began furiously researching its causes and became convinced he had contracted it through using his mobile phone			1
the infectious 40 - year - old @entity11 restaurateur who passed away in may this year became determined to raise awareness about the cancer , which is the biggest single cancer killer of people under the age of 40			1
' the doctor believes it was from the phone , [ the tumour ] was on the left side just above his ear and he was left - handed and on the phone 24 hours a day , ' @entity1 's mother @entity16 told @entity23			2
' they ca n't prove anything like that , so what @entity1 wanted to do is start the foundation , to raise money for cancer research , give warnings to young people about using their mobile phones			1
' it 's like smoking , how many years [ did it take ] them to prove that smoking caused lung cancer ? how long for this ? ' @entity1 's idea was to host an event at restaurants across @entity43 , including at his own restaurant @entity45 , called @entity46 , where people would leave their mobile phones and tablets at home and a portion of their bill would be donated to brain cancer research			1
after @entity1 passed away on may 23 this year his parents , @entity3 and @entity16 , as well as the @entity56 organisation banded together to make @entity1 's dream happen			1
' he told the doctor “ i 'll do something about it "			0
he wanted to start the foundation , he got sick and he could n't do it			0
we had to carry on that work , ' said mrs @entity16			0
' he was my baby			0
his death is very devastating for me and my husband and my two sons … but i 'm grateful we 're doing [ @entity46 ] because he wanted to do it and we 're finishing it for him			0
' @entity1 ( centre in white shirt ) ran @entity11 restaurant @entity73			2
he wanted to run a fundraising event for brain cancer research which saw people leave their mobile phones at home the pilot @entity80 ran yesterday in 10 restaurants across @entity43 and the @entity56 organisation will gather information about how successful it is before deciding whether to make the event an annual fundraising and to expand it nationwide			1
@entity88 , founder - benefactor of @entity56 , told @entity89 that @entity56 was not ' in any way intimating that technology is a contributor to brain cancer ' saying that numerous studies had shown there is ' absolutely no correlation ' between mobile phone usage and brain cancer			1
but she said the @entity80 was a good way of drawing attention to brain cancer , which despite being the biggest single cancer killer of children and having a much lower survival rate than breast cancer or prostate cancer , only attracted three percent of government funding for cancer research and treatment			2
the event was also a way of encouraging interpersonal etiquette and dinner conversation , something that was one of @entity1 's pet peeves , who had seen the prevalence of mobile phone usage by diners at his restaurant			1
' when mum and dad go out to dinner what do you do to make the kids shut up ? you give them the phone , that 's no good			0
what do you do when you go to dinner with your husband ? you talk on your phone , you do n't enjoy your food , you do n't talk to each other , ' said mrs @entity16			0
ms @entity88 said that leaving one 's phone at home or switiching it off was ' challenging ' but the idea behind the fundraiser was ' enjoy the environment , enjoy the food , enjoy your company ' , an ethos she – and mrs @entity16 – think @entity1 would have approved of .			0

@entity1 , 40 , a @entity11 restauranteur died from cancer in may
believes he contracted brain cancer from too much mobile phone use
his dying wish was to raise awareness about brain cancer by holding a @entity46 event
his parents and @entity56 ran the event yesterday to honour him
