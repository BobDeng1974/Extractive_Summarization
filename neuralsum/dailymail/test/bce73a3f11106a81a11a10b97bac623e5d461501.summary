@entity1 's controversial new laws banning ultra-thin models from strutting down the catwalk may be doing more harm than good as models are reportedly going to extreme measures to ensure they clock in at a ' healthy ' weight when they hop on the scale - including stuffing their underwear with sandbags			1
earlier this month @entity14 passed a new law that bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low , in an attempt to combat anorexia			1
and the pressure is on for agencies who can face a fines of up to $ 80,000 and six months in prison for employing too - thin models			0
but former model @entity28 , 38 , from @entity29 , @entity30 , has revealed in an op - ed for the @entity32 that the fashion industry has already found a way around the regulations , explaining that thin models are now resorting to wearing weighted @entity36 in order to cheat the new @entity39 standards			1
new kind of pressure : former model @entity28 , pictured in 2013 ( r ) and 2003 ( @entity42 ) , has reported that models are being asked to wear @entity36 underwear stuffed with sandbags , so they can clock in at a ' healthy ' weight different rules : models can be seen walking down the runway at the @entity52 show in march at @entity53			1
@entity14 recently passed a law banning models from the catwalk if their body mass index is too low an anonymous model , referred to in the piece as ' @entity60 ' , told @entity28 that she participated in @entity61 , sometime after the country passed its new weight law in 2006 and recalled being asked to hide weights in her undergarments			1
' they gave us @entity36 underwear to stuff with weighted sandbags so the thinnest of girls had a " healthy " weight on the scales , ' @entity60 said			1
' i even saw them put weights in their hair			0
' @entity28 went on to say that she hopes the @entity78 does not try to pass this ' discriminatory and misguided ' because of its negative affect on naturally thin women			0
she noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because @entity39 calculations , which are based on weight and height , do n't take age , sex or genetic body shape into account			2
' at 16 , when i was working as a fashion model , i weighed 115 pounds and was 5 ’ 7 ” 1/2 , ' she wrote			0
' i exercised regularly and really loved to eat @entity91 veggie sandwiches and drink @entity93 ’s vanilla milkshakes			0
' @entity95 changes : models can be seen strutting down the catwalk during the @entity99 show at @entity53 in march			0
agencies who employ ' too - thin ' models face large fines and even jail time under the new @entity14 law she continued : ' i was not anorexic or starving - i was definitely over-worked			1
i was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system			0
' @entity28 noted that as a teen with a @entity39 of 18.0 , she would most certainly have been considered ' underweight ' ; while the exact @entity39 requirements for models working in @entity14 have not been released , the @entity109 considers people with a @entity39 below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished			1
and while @entity28 says that , 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a ' normal ' 21.0 , her @entity39 for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws			2
while the model rights activist applauded the @entity14 government for attempting to protect the health of ' these young working professionals ' , she and @entity60 both agreed that outlawing skinny altogether is not the answer			2
' i think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18 , ' @entity60 told @entity28			2
' many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty , and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all			0
' model rights activist : @entity28 spoke with @entity131 ( r ) about trafficking , abuse , and child labor problems within the fashion industry on @entity136 in february strict rules : the 38 - year - old , who snapped this ' @entity140 ' selfie in february , noted her @entity39 would have been considered too low when she was a healthy 16 - year - old model because she had a fast metabolism @entity28 added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models , the @entity14 government should ' look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client - models as working professionals '			1
because models are considered independent contractors in the @entity78 , standard employment laws , which allow workers mandatory breaks , compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment , do not apply			0
@entity162 , who is a model and founder of the @entity166 organization , told @entity167 in march that she is also against the new @entity14 law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a ' healthy ideal '			1
' @entity39 suggests there are distinct categories of underweight , ideal , overweight and obese , with sharp boundaries that hinge on a decimal place , which is simply not true , ' she explained			0
' it is unfair and unreasonable to ban healthy models from working just because they have a relatively low @entity39			2

former model @entity28 , 38 , claims that models are being asked to stuff their underwear with sandbags so they can clock in at a ' healthy ' weight
the activist says she is against @entity14 's new law , which bars models from walking the runway if their body mass index is deemed too low
