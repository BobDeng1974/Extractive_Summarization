the ancient @entity1 were among the first victims of man - made greenhouse gases when @entity5 forced them to mine silver at @entity8 240 years before the @entity9 , it was claimed today			1
the earliest evidence of large - scale human - produced greenhouse gases in @entity12 was found encased in ice in the @entity14			1
in the 16th century during its conquest of @entity12 the @entity17 forced @entity1 to work in the mountaintop mines of @entity8 in what is now @entity20 - then the largest source of silver in the world			1
the earliest evidence of large - scale human - produced greenhouse gases in @entity12 was found encased in ice in the @entity14			1
the samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the @entity28 andes			2
layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years			2
the indigenous population already knew how to refine the metal but in 1572 the @entity17 introduced a new technology that boosted production many times over and sent thick clouds of lead dust rising over the @entity14 for the first time in history			1
@entity43 carried some of that pollution 500 miles northwest into @entity28 where tiny remnants of it settled on the @entity48			0
there it stayed - buried under hundreds of years of snow and ice - until researchers from @entity54 found it in 2003			2
now in @entity57 they report the discovery of a layer within an ice core that dates to the @entity17 conquest , contains bits of lead and bears the chemical signature of the silver mines of @entity8			1
the core makes @entity48 one of only a few select sites on the planet where the pre-industrial human impact on air quality can be studied today			0
dr @entity72 said : ' this evidence supports the idea human impact on the environment was widespread even before the industrial revolution			0
' prof @entity77 said the find is ' another keyhole into the past of human activity in that part of the world ' and believes further investigation could help us better understand the fate of pollution circulating in the atmosphere today			0
the samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the @entity28 andes			2
layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years			0
the researchers found a spike in bismuth - a chemical by - product of mining metals - around 148o when the @entity1 was expanding			2
and around 154o less than a decade after the beginning of @entity17 colonisation in @entity12 trace element concentrations of several metals - including lead - rose			2
the refining process the @entity17 introduced involved grinding silver ore - which contains much more lead than silver - into powder before mixing it with mercury in a process called amalgamation			1
so atmospheric pollution from silver production would chiefly contain traces of lead particulates			1
the steeple of the church of the town @entity8 is seen at the @entity124 - @entity123 water reservoir while the @entity1 had long extracted silver , a new processing method introduced by the @entity17 in 1572 greatly increased production even as it belched lead dust and other pollutants into the atmosphere			1
the pollution blew over the entire region , including the @entity48 some 500 miles ( 800 km ) northwest in southern @entity28			0
the @entity17 refining process involved pulverizing silver ore , containing both lead and silver , into powder , which sent metallic dust into the atmosphere			1
the powder was mixed with mercury			0
the silver was separated by heating the mixture to allow the mercury to evaporate			0
starting just before @entity143 the @entity48 ice began capturing much larger quantities of these elements - and the high amounts persisted until the early @entity147 when @entity12 countries declared independence from @entity17			2
to pin down where the pollution came from the researchers compared their data with those from a peat bog in @entity156 and from sedimentary lake records from regions including @entity8 and other mines throughout @entity20 and @entity28			1
these latter sites would have captured the pollution generated in their local area during that time			0
the chemical signatures in the @entity48 ice suggests most of the pollution likely came from @entity8 - where the @entity17 produced the vast majority of silver			1
even in their highest concentrations , the elements entrapped in the ice are not visible to the naked eye and can be detected only through chemical analyses			0
the section of core containing them has the translucent white appearance of perfectly clean ice			0
an independent miner leaves the @entity179 zinc - tin mine pulling a two - tons wagon loaded with poorly concentrated mineral at the famous @entity8 mountain in @entity8 , @entity20 - where in 1572 the @entity17 introduced a new technology that boosted production - but created huge amounts of pollutrton dr @entity72 said : ' the fact we can detect pollution in ice from a pristine high altitude location is indicative of the continental significance of this deposition			1
only a significant source of pollution could travel so far , and affect the chemistry of the snow on a remote place like @entity48			0
' ice cores in @entity200 contain traces of lead from as far back as the 5th century @entity203 which were sent airborne by smelting in the ancient @entity205 and @entity206 civilizations			1
this latest ice core from @entity48 shows that humans generated substantial pollution in the 16th century			2
still the 2oth century produced more pollution than any other time in human history			0
international geological governing bodies are currently considering whether to officially call our current epoch the @entity216 , or ' @entity217 , ' to designate the span of time that humans have been changing the environment			0
the researchers hope the @entity48 core will inform that debate .			0

pollution created by silver mining 240 years before @entity9
@entity17 forced @entity1 to work in mountaintop mines of @entity8 , now @entity20
in 1572 the @entity17 introduced a new technology that boosted production
ice cores reveal it sent thick clouds of lead dust rising over the @entity14
