the last time @entity2 played a @entity3 in @entity4 it all went badly wrong for him off the field but bouncing back from that , and proving what he is made of , has been the making of @entity10 ’s world - class full back			1
in 2008 , @entity2 was one of two @entity10 players found guilty of misconduct , fined and reprimanded by the @entity13 following a big night out after the @entity3			1
the net result was that @entity2 lost his place and did not play again for @entity10 for four years			1
that ’s an eternity when you are a young , ambitious , patriotic and very talented rugby player and it can make or break you			0
@entity2 was always a good player but not a great player and nobody was arguing stongly that he was a ' must ' selection , including me			2
back in the day : @entity2 faced @entity24 with @entity10 in 2008 but his tour ended in controversy better player : @entity2 has returned to the @entity10 set - up with a bang following his four - year exile such experiences are normally a huge wake - up call but , if flipped around , can also be massive motivators			1
when you get picked for @entity10 you can start ‘ living the dream ’ and think it will last forever - 30 years on from my @entity10 playing career i remember that feeling only too well - but the reality is that your time at the top goes in a flash and you have to make every minute of every game count			1
to be left out for any reason other than ability is something that will haunt you forever			0
with @entity10 there are always players queuing up to take your place , they have so many good players in every position and if you step out of line or fall out of favour you have to ask yourself how much you really want it			0
the only way back often is to become a ‘ great ’ player			0
@entity2 ’s response was to redouble his efforts with @entity59 , help them to top domestic honours , become a model professional and that great player			1
it has been his very good fortune to have in @entity65 , his boss at @entity59 , an outstanding individual who demands high standards while @entity69 is another rock - solid character			1
but it is @entity2 who deserves the plaudits and there is nothing better than to prove the doubters wrong			0
after four years of hard graft , @entity2 won back his place in the @entity10 team , initially on the wing against @entity82 in 2012 before reclaiming the full - back berth			1
now he returns to @entity24 as one of @entity10 ’s ' go - to ' men			1
it ’s a big moment in every sense			0
being ‘ great ’ at @entity88 is one thing , being great in @entity24 is another level altogether			0
in the spotlight : to be left out of the @entity10 team for anything other than ability will haunt a player forever fortress : the @entity24 are unbeaten at @entity4 's @entity98 stadium for 20 years @entity2 was recently voted @entity100 player of the season by his peers and the @entity104 player of the season by the public which will guarantee him being targeted – as a player and individual - by @entity24 on saturday			1
he should take that as a huge compliment , although it might not feel like it as he plucks another high ball out of the air with half the @entity24 pack in close attendance			0
@entity24 will target @entity2 in two ways , firstly as a player and then as an individual			1
they will have studied his running lines and how he always seems to break the first tackle			0
@entity2 invariably ups the tempo and intensity when he comes into the line or counter-attacks - things begin to happen - but @entity24 will also know the extra value of turning him over as often as possible			1
often in the @entity130 we put too much emphasis on a full - back ’s defensive qualities			2
for me full - back has always been a key attacking position , made for players who can ‘ make something happen ’			2
the southern hemisphere takes that view as well			0
you think of the carnage @entity144 used to cause at full - back and how he was n’t so effective when he was moved to centre			2
more recently @entity147 ’s most potent attacking weapon is @entity148 , @entity24 look to @entity150			0
you have to ask the question - who would the opposition least want running the ball back at them if they kick it away ? in my time with @entity10 that was @entity157 and @entity158 , now for @entity10 that is definitely @entity2			1
he is a huge attacking threat			0
four tries in the recent @entity104 , 49 tries in 150 @entity100 matches from full - back for @entity59 tells its own story			1
dangerman : @entity24 full back @entity150 is a master of attacking with the ball from full back unpredictable : @entity157 was one is one of the finest examples of an attacking full back @entity2 adds tempo to the game and @entity10 need to get him involved as much as possible so one thing i would like to see him do is follow all @entity24 kicks into touch and grab them before the ball - boys , so every time he has got the option of taking a quick throw , either to himself or a supporting player			1
it wo n’t always be on but @entity10 need to know that it is always an option and pour back in support			2
it ’s a great way of imposing the tempo you want to play at			0
@entity24 will also test @entity2 ’s character and see if he really can turn the other cheek in the heat of battle			1
he is a fiery , feisty character on the pitch - mr @entity191 to his team - mates - and i like that attitude but you have to know exactly where that line is in test rugby and avoid stepping over it			2
the @entity24 would love to get him involved in some verbals or a fracas of some sort because not only might it distract him it would get the whole @entity4 crowd going and baying for @entity206 blood			0
the @entity207 always play better when it starts to kick off , when there is electricity in the air and the testosterone levels start rising as the clashes start getting close up and personal			0
they thrive off that but are n’t always so comfortable when a good side just goes quietly about its business and basically ignores them			0
@entity2 needs to rein it in and show all that great professionalism which has become the cornerstone of his game since he was last down @entity4 way			2
on the run : @entity10 warm - up with some sprints prior to their training session at the @entity227 toughest test : @entity69 's @entity10 side face an almighty challenge in saturday 's match			2

@entity59 full back @entity2 has made major *improvements* in his game since he toured @entity24 in 2008
@entity2 was caught up in controversy on *previous* @entity24 tour and faced a four - year @entity10 exile
now @entity2 is @entity10 's dangerman and he will be targeted by the @entity24
he is a fiery character but he must keep his cool at @entity98
