she spent years of ' heartache ' and thousands of dollars on @entity2 in a desperate attempt to conceive			1
and in 2011 , @entity4 gave birth by a set of twins - followed by another set 16 months ago			1
now , the devoted mother - of - four is taking to @entity10 in a bid to help another couple to achieve their dream of having children - by advertising her six unused , donated embryos for adoption			1
however , she will not accept any willing parents - to - be - they must adhere to a list of what some may perceive as unusual terms that she has posted on the social networking site			1
mrs @entity4 , mother to @entity25 and @entity26 , aged three , and 16 - month - old @entity27 and @entity28 , says she wants the couple whom she chooses to be financially capable of supporting six children			1
perhaps most strikingly , the chosen couple must raise any children together and allow the @entity53 to have a relationship with their biological siblings - unlike many embryo donation arrangements			2
they should also not space the offspring too far apart in age - ideally , the majority of the embryos will be used over ' a six - year window ' , mrs @entity4 , who lives with her family in @entity66 , says			2
in her long @entity10 post in december , mrs @entity4 , whose embryos are in storage at the @entity69 in @entity70 , said : ' we come with good news for someone out there			2
strict guidelines : however , the mother - of - four ( pictured ) will not accept any willing parents - to - be - they must adhere to a list of what some may perceive as unusual terms that she has posted on the social network site desires : mrs @entity4 says she wants the couple whom she chooses to be financially capable of supporting six children			1
they must also be in ' a steady , loving relationship ' with good health and roots in @entity49 ' we are seeking a couple in the area who has roots in @entity49 who is having issues with infertility who are otherwise healthy and will need @entity2 in order to start a family			2
- a couple that wants a large family and can afford to have six children - they will ideally be in ' a steady , loving relationship ' and have ' a strong @entity45 background ' - they must have roots in @entity49 - aside from issues with infertility , they should otherwise be healthy - ' no super age gap ' between the siblings - ideally , most embryos will be used over ' a six - year window ' - they must be 35 years old or younger ' in order to set the process up for the best odds of success ' ' we have 6 good quality frozen six - day - old embryos to donate to an amazing family who wants a large family			2
... it would be very nice if there is no super huge age gap between the siblings			0
' speaking to @entity131 , mrs @entity4 said she decided to advertise her extra embryos - initially donated by a 20 - year - old woman - after reading stories of ill - fated donor - conceived children			1
some of these children felt disregarded - by science and donor anonymity - from any chance of knowing anything about where they came from , she said			0
in relation to her own children , she added : ' sometimes , when they are playing together and doing their own thing , absorbed in their own little world , i feel like i could just watch them forever			0
' i feel like i do n't even need to watch television , that i could just watch them all the time			0
' doctor and lawyer @entity153 , of @entity155 , told the news site that some of mrs @entity4 's terms were backed by scientific evidence			0
she explained how the desires of donor - conceived children are not entirely different from those of adopted children			0
family : speaking to @entity131 , mrs @entity4 ( pictured with her family ) said she decided to advertise her extra embryos - initially donated by a 20 - year - old woman - after reading stories of ill - fated donor - conceived children further rules : perhaps most strikingly , the chosen couple must raise any children together and allow the @entity53 to have a relationship with their biological siblings - unlike many embryo donation arrangements mrs @entity4 said : ' we are seeking open communication and meetings so siblings grow up to know each other ' ' there 's tons of evidence to show that many , many people who are raised in families that were n't the ones who bore them want to know where they came from , ' she said			1
she added that there appeared to be nothing legally wrong about mrs @entity4 donating the embryos			0
although the @entity53 have received numerous responses to their @entity10 post , they are yet to find a match			0
mrs @entity4 , 45 , can not carry the additional ' good quality ' embryos herself due to her age and health .			0

she finally gave birth to two sets of twins , aged three and 16 months old
now , she is taking to @entity10 to find couple to adopt six extra embryos
but she will not accept any willing parents - they must adhere to terms
