the bosses of @entity3 's three spy agencies who were supposedly ' grilled ' by @entity5 agreed questions with them in advance , it has emerged			1
the revelation has led one @entity10 mp to dub the hearings two weeks ago ' a total pantomime '			2
mps summoned the heads of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 to an historic public session of the secretive intelligence and security committee to discuss leaks by the whistleblower @entity21			1
@entity15 's @entity22 , @entity16 's @entity23 and @entity17 's @entity24 before the committee on november 7 , where they discussed leaks by the whistleblower @entity21			1
they were fed questions in advance the committee is usually held in private and the hearing , which was televised and an hour and a half long , was trumped as heralding a new era of transparency			1
but sources told the @entity35 there was a row between the committee 's nine members , who are all senior mps and @entity40 , after they were told the chiefs would only appear on the condition that they were told questions beforehand			1
the row focuses on the secretive intelligence and security committee , which evades the rules that apply to most parts of government			2
its nine members are nominated by the prime minister and serving government ministers are not allowed to be members			2
members see highly classified material , hold most of their sessions in private and must sign the @entity56			2
it also has greater powers than normal government committees and can summon official advice to ministers or evidence from previous governments			0
the current members include former @entity66 cabinet member @entity65 , former @entity67 leader sir @entity67 and its chairman , former conservative foreign secretary sir @entity68 ( pictured above )			0
it raises fears over whether the @entity5 had no choice but to follow a softer line of questioning instead of holding the spy chiefs to account			1
@entity74 chairman sir @entity68 told the @entity35 : ' we gave them the initial questions ... we can not suddenly put a question to an intelligence chief that they might only be able to answer by reference to secret material			1
' @entity15 's @entity22 , @entity16 's @entity23 and @entity17 's @entity24 appeared before the committee on november 7 after high - profile leaks by the whistleblower @entity21 were published in the @entity87 newspaper			1
he released files detailing how the @entity91 , with the help of @entity3 counterparts , routinely collate e-mails from ordinary people and tapped the phone of the @entity96 chancellor @entity95			0
in his first public speech since april , mr @entity22 condemned the leaks and said they were ' the gift [ terrorists ] need to evade us and strike at will			1
' he added : ' unfashionable as it might seem , that is why we must keep secrets secret , and why not doing so causes such harm			0
' sir @entity23 also told the hearing : ' i am not sure that the journalists who are managing this very sensitive information are particularly well placed , actually , to make judgments [ about its dangerousness ]			2
' what i can tell you is that the leaks from @entity21 have been very damaging			1
they have put our operations at risk			0
it is clear that our adversaries are rubbing their hands with glee			0
@entity126 is lapping it up			0
' @entity17 , whose headquarters in @entity130 are pictured , has been in the news over eavesdropping claims before the hearing , however , chiefs agreed to devote only a third of the allotted time to @entity21 , the @entity35 reported , and agreed the line of questioning in advance			1
there were criticisms after the hearing that it had not given any real answers and that the spy chiefs had simply refused to answer several questions - citing security concerns			1
professor @entity146 , director for the @entity147 at @entity148 , told the newspaper : ' stage - managing is reminiscent of the old @entity151 , everybody applauding themselves			0
that is not the impression they should be giving			2
they should not be about mutual self - congratulation			0
it should be about holding people to account			0
' an anonymous @entity10 mp also told the newspaper : ' evidently the whole thing was a total pantomime '			0
a @entity165 spokesman told @entity166 : ' the session was not scripted			0
as is commonplace for @entity74 , the broad areas of questioning - although not every detailed question - is shared in advance in order that the witnesses can prepare themselves adequately whilst still allowing for an engaging and spontaneous exchange			0
