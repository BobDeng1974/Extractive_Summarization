by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:23 est , 9 september 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 10 september 2013 @entity3 plans for military strikes on @entity5 were in disarray last night after @entity7 seized on a blunder from @entity3 secretary of state @entity9			1
mr @entity9 suggested the @entity5 tyrant could prevent international military action against his country by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal			1
he caused further confusion in @entity15 by promising any missile strikes that may take place would be ‘ unbelievably small ’			1
the plan was also welcomed by @entity37 secretary general @entity36			0
last night the @entity3 government said it would take a ‘ hard look ’ at the @entity7 proposal but had ‘ serious scepticism ’ about putting @entity5 ’s chemical weapons under international protection			1
but diplomatic sources said there had been no discussion at last week ’s @entity48 summit of such a plan			0
one said mr @entity9 ’s intervention , made as he concluded a tour of @entity53 nations , risked complicating a crunch vote in the @entity55 over whether to back @entity57 ’s plans to use force against @entity5			2
the @entity55 will vote tomorrow , the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on @entity61			0
however , if president @entity57 fears losing the vote , some suspect he may yet use mr @entity9 ’s intervention as a device to delay			0
talks : @entity7 offered to start work ' immediately ' to put @entity28 's poison gas stocks under ' international control ' after @entity9 's comments the idea president @entity28 could hand over his weapons began as a flippant remark by mr @entity9 yesterday morning in @entity73 after talks with foreign secretary @entity27			1
the @entity75 refused to say whether they agreed the line with the secretary of state but one administration official told @entity79 it was ‘ a major goof ’			2
asked what president @entity28 could do to avoid military action , mr @entity9 said : ‘ he can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			1
’ he hastily added : ‘ he is n’t about to do it and it ca n’t be done , obviously			0
’ seeking to assuage critics of military intervention , the @entity3 secretary of state insisted : ‘ we are not talking about war			1
we are not going to war			0
' we will be able to hold @entity28 accountable without engaging in troops on the ground or any prolonged kind of effort in a very limited , very targeted , very short - term effort			0
’ confusing : @entity9 , right , also said any missile strike by the @entity3 would be ' unbelievably small ' allies : tyrant @entity28 , left , passed his thanks on to @entity7 president @entity103 for his ongoing support in the @entity48 against a @entity3 led bid to launch military action against @entity5 within hours , @entity7 seized on the idea			1
the country ’s foreign minister @entity20 , following talks in @entity110 with his @entity5 counterpart @entity111 , said : ‘ if the establishment of international control over chemical weapons in that country would allow avoiding strikes , we will immediately start working with @entity118			1
‘ we are calling on the @entity5 leadership to not only agree on placing chemical weapons storage sites under international control , but also on its subsequent destruction and fully joining the treaty on prohibition of chemical weapons			2
’ mr @entity111 said that @entity5 ‘ welcomes @entity7 ’s initiative , based on the @entity5 ’s government care about the lives of our people and security of our country ’			2
asked in the @entity133 about @entity110 ’s proposals , mr @entity132 said : ‘ if that were to be the case , it would be hugely welcome			0
i think we have to be careful though to make sure this is not a distraction tactic to discuss something else rather than the problem on the table			0
’ diplomacy : foreign secretary @entity27 , left , meets with his @entity3 counterpart @entity9 during his whistle - stop tour of @entity146 former @entity148 presidential candidate @entity147 , whose support for military action appeared to have been won by president @entity57 , said the suggestion strikes would be ‘ unbelievably small ’ was ‘ unbelievably unhelpful ’			1
speaking to @entity152 , @entity28 warned that if mr @entity57 decides to launch military strikes , the @entity3 and its allies that , in retaliation : ‘ you should expect everything			2
not necessarily from the government			0
’ diplomatic sources said @entity5 had always refused to sign up to anti-chemical weapons treaties and did not even acknowledge the existence of its stockpiles , meaning the chances of meaningful progress were negligible			2
they also poured scorn on the idea that @entity7 could be trusted to act as an honest broker in any deal			0
defiant : @entity28 said he was ready for an @entity3 - led military strike and expected that ' repercussions ' would follow for the @entity3 , during an interview on @entity152 he replied : ' he can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			1
' he added : ' he is n't about to do it and it ca n't be done , obviously			0
' mr @entity9 used the opportunity to redouble his attacks on @entity28 , saying that the @entity5 president 's credibility was in question			2
' he sends scud missiles into schools , ' he said ' ( @entity15 ) knows where the rockets came from and where they landed ... and it was no accident that they all came from regime - controlled territory and all landed ( in opposition - held territory ) ' in an interview on @entity152 's @entity194 , @entity28 argued that the evidence mr @entity9 has disclosed about chemical weapons use amounts to a ' big lie ' that resembled the case for war in @entity200 the @entity3 made to the @entity37 over a decade ago			1
asked to respond , mr @entity9 said he would be confident to take evidence that the @entity3 intelligence committee has gathered into any court			0
' what does he offer ? ' mr @entity9 asked			0
' words that are contradicted by fact			0
' the @entity75 has led international calls for the pressing need to prevent further atrocities after harrowing video emerged of an alleged chemical weapons attack which killed nearly 1,400 people			1
however , @entity3 has appeared increasingly isolated after prime minister @entity132 was defeat in the @entity214 on a plan for @entity217 involvement in military strikes on the @entity219 - blamed for deploying the banned munitions against its own people			2
fallout : free @entity225 fighter @entity224 , 23 , who lost his legs in a @entity5 @entity228 strike , is carried by a family member into @entity230 as thousands more flee the conflict protest : anti-war protestors demonstrated outside the @entity217 's @entity233 as @entity3 secretary @entity234 @entity9 visited monday			1
