in the shelter of a @entity3 conference room , @entity0 cut a relaxed figure on friday			1
after a leisurely arrival in a pair of shorts and flip - flops , he greeted the assembled media with a smile , a handshake and a joke about his dubious choice of footwear			1
the atmosphere in the room was relaxed			0
and at odds with the previous seven months of a season when the atmosphere surrounding @entity17 has usually been much darker and tense			0
truth be told , the only guiding light at @entity21 this season has been a half - lit torch leading straight to a land where only chaos itself holds jurisdiction			1
where perpetual farce and vitriol have been interrupted only by the false dawns of hope and sanctuary			0
@entity0 believes that @entity17 ' promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish for @entity37 , however , a corner has now been turned			1
now in his second season at @entity21 , the 26 - year - old midfielder has been one of the few @entity17 players who might - yes , just might - have achieved pass - marks so far this campaign			1
following last weekend ’s 2 - 0 victory against @entity45 promotion rivals @entity46 - a timely boost for the new regime and caretaker boss @entity49 believes that the club ’s promotion destiny is finally in their own hands after months of anguish			1
‘ last weekend gave a huge lift to everyone , going and beating @entity46 at @entity55 , ’ he grinned			1
‘ we had been comfortably beaten by them three times previously this season , so there has been a huge difference in and around the place this week			0
‘ the manager has relayed the message to us that we are now in charge of our own situation once again – our own destiny			1
everyone in our changing room came to play with @entity17 in the @entity69 and , even as bad as we have been this season , getting promoted is still within our grasp			0
‘ when you come into work in the morning , you can see everyone smiling again – not just the players , but also all of the club staff			1
it ’s great to see things like that again because it ’s been doom and gloom right from the word go this season			1
@entity17 boss @entity49 has taken over the @entity21 side in reach of gaining promotion back to the @entity86 ‘ we lost our first game of the season , then had a little bit of a lift , but things spiralled again from there			2
it was downhill all the way and it has been difficult			0
‘ people are now looking forward to coming into training again and they ’re looking forward to games , which is the most important thing – the game against @entity96 on saturday actually ca n’t come quick enough for us			0
‘ there has been such negativity surrounding the place			0
it got to the stage where you genuinely did n’t want to leave the house			0
if your family wanted to go out you would just say : “ no , let ’s just leave it and stay in			2
” the whole thing is so consuming that it affects your personal life – not just your professional one			0
‘ then last sunday against @entity46 was a huge improvement			1
you could see the energy and desire in the team was fantastic			0
‘ but we are under no illusions			0
we know that dropping points against @entity96 would be no good , so it ’s up to us now to press on			1
‘ for the first time in a while , we ’re probably looking forward to our own game - but we should be looking forward to every single game at home			2
@entity121 ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving @entity17 the lead away to @entity46 @entity127 slots home to put the game beyond doubt for @entity17 and close the gap on @entity46 ‘ i go back to my old @entity132 days when you had @entity17 away and you would dread going to @entity21			1
in the week leading up to it in training , you knew you were in for such a tough game			0
that ’s what it should feel like for teams coming to us now			2
we want to put fear into visiting teams at @entity21 and we will only do that by winning more games			0
’ conventional wisdom might point to the old adage of familiarity breeding contempt – but that ’s not the case for @entity0 and @entity49			1
law spent two seasons playing under @entity49 at @entity132 , before moving to @entity17 in the summer of 2013 , and was a key figure in the @entity155 side the manager led to consecutive second - place finishes in the @entity69 in 2012 and 2013			2
‘ the gaffer has given everyone such a massive lift since he arrived at the club , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ his personality , his character and the way he is so positive – it ’s all great			2
he laughs and jokes with everyone and just lifts our spirits			0
@entity127 celebrates his goal with the @entity17 fans during his side 's win in the @entity45 last weekend ‘ people might think i ’m biased because i have worked with him before , but i have no doubt whatsoever that all of the lads would say the same thing about him			1
‘ it ’s not just his energy , but his coaching ability , too			2
last week we switched to a 3 - 5 - 2 formation at @entity46			1
the gaffer made sure we worked on it all week in training , made sure everyone knew their jobs and made sure no stone was left unturned			0
‘ he gets the best out of you and improves you as a player			0
in that respect , he is actually the perfect man for the job here because the club is not in a position to go out and spend fortunes on new players			2
‘ he has a track record of working with a budget , working with what he ’s got and doing really well			2
it ’s hard to teach that ability of having an eye for a player and being able to spot talent , but he has it			2
‘ he ’s been first - class with us since the moment he walked through the door			1
our confidence was totally shot to pieces			0
he has played a huge part already in us turning that around and , hopefully , we can now kick on towards promotion			0
