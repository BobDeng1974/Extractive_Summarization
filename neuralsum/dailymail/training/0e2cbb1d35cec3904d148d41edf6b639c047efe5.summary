' you have to say what you feel the @entity37 tells you to say , without concerns of human respect and without fear , ' @entity0 instructed the bishops at the start of their meeting			1
at the same time , he urged the nearly 200 cardinals , bishops and priests gathered for the synod to listen to one another with humility ' and welcome with an open heart what our brothers say			1
' the discussions beforehand have already caused bitter arguments among senior clergy			1
reformist cardinals have already proposed allowing the divorced and remarried to take @entity57			1
this is currently banned as the church does not recognise divorce so remarried people are regarded as adulterers			2

in his opening speech the pope hailed the synod of bishops as a once - in - a - generation opportunity to review @entity9 teaching on controversial topics such as abortion , contraception and gay unions other possible changes , such as the blessing of gay civil unions , would be even more contentious			1
pope @entity0 seems determined to shake up the @entity28 and has shown some signs of liberal views			2

' in a bid to encourage debate , the @entity4 is restricting public information about what is said behind closed doors during the synod			0
