it is one of the most polluted countries on earth			0
so it may come as little surprise that the latest fad in @entity7 is literally offering its city dwellers a breath of fresh air			1
numerous fresh air stations have been set up in some of @entity7 's most polluted cities			1
the stations are stocked with individual air bags which provide users with pollution - free fresh air			1
and they have proved to be a big hit with one air station in @entity20 in central @entity7 's @entity22 province which was inundated with visitors			1
a breath of fresh air : city dwellers in @entity20 , @entity22 province , are hooked up to oxygen masks so they can breathe in some fresh air as the country 's pollution hits crisis levels growing crisis : an ' air station hostess ' holds up an oxygen bag for a little girl as the @entity35 described @entity7 's smog levels as an environmental crisis uniformed air hostesses hook up visitors to oxygen masks so they can breathe air sourced from the @entity43 scenic spot in @entity44 , which is 80 % green land , in @entity22 province			1
there was no shortage of takers as locals flooded to enjoy the free fresh air			2
@entity50 , 75 , said : ' the air is really good , but the time is too short			0
i had to stop too soon but it was really great until then			0
' it comes after just three of @entity7 's 74 cities met the official air quality standards , according to the @entity58 in @entity7 escape : the station in @entity20 was inundated with visitors wanting some fresh air breathing it all in : air stations are expected to become a regular sight in @entity7 as pollution levels reach all - time highs the air bags are @entity7 's latest attempt to address its dangerous smog levels - described as an environmental crisis by the @entity35 - after canned and bottled air already hit the streets			1
the air stations follow on from last week when costumed characters called @entity76 were giving away air bottles filled with air collected at the @entity80 scenic spot in the county of @entity82 in @entity84 province			2
the @entity76 babies have been touring the country , promoting the new products , which are currently free of charge , and were pictured in the city of @entity90 in east @entity7 's @entity84 province			1
product manager @entity92 said : ' the air in @entity80 mountain is so fresh that negative oxygen ion is 3,300 per cubic centimetre , much higher than the normal level			0
the problem is that there are not enough negative ions in daily life			0
all the modern things we have generate an over abundance of positive ions that make us feel tired , depressed and irritable			0
' capturing air : bottled air pictured being collected at the @entity80 scenic spot in @entity109 in @entity84 province bottled air is proving to be a big hit as new figures show that just three of the 74 cities in @entity7 meet official air quality standards but in @entity43 , where the air bags are being distributed , park managers say the average negative oxygen ion is 30,000 per cubic centimetre			1
in some places on @entity43 , the average negative oxygen ion can be 50,000 per cubic centimeter			0
the inspiration for the idea reportedly came from tourist shops near @entity125 in @entity126 , where cans of fresh air have been a huge success			2
during a @entity132 meeting , @entity7 's president , @entity130 , suggested @entity134 ' sell cans in the future ' , adding : ' air quality is now a deciding factor in people 's perception of happiness			1
' however , it 's not the first time bottle air has gone on sale in @entity7			0
last year , @entity144 , who made his fortune in the recycling business and is a high - profile philanthropist , claimed to have sold 10 million cans in just 10 days , as pollution levels reached a record high			0
the move comes after the country 's biggest online travel agency and insurance firms joined forces to offer policies to tourists whose trips are blighted in being visually impaired by the pollution			0
air in a jar : bottled air is being collected at the @entity80 scenic spot in @entity109 in @entity84 province and distributed to city dwellers new trend : ' oxygen babies ' have been touring the country giving out free bottled oxygen			2
