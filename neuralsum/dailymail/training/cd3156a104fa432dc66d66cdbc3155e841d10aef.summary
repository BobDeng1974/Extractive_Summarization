it was a summery colour splash on the @entity8 catwalk yesterday in @entity10 an 86 - strong pack of model took to the catwalk to show off the striped collection against a backdrop reminiscent of a summer in @entity44 the star of the show was a basket - shaped skirt which was inspired by those traditionally used in the farming community to collect and transport fruit , but given a chic and stylish new look , of course			1
an emerging trend was most definitely the use of the basket to construct corsets and skirts alike with an occasional hint of lace as well as stark stripes in red , white and monochrome			0
symbolising a glamorous holiday in the @entity2 sun , designs featured gorgeous prints of lemons , maps and @entity12 folk art. in true @entity72 style , the show closed to loud applause as a pack of eighty - six models in 86 different patterned scarves took to the catwalk			2
bold stripes , colourful prints and dazzling chandelier earrings were prominent on the catwalk basket - style dresses , skirts and corsets were the stars of the show drawing on baskets once used by women to collect fruit the collection was a perfect reflection of the brand 's newest shop in the @entity2 capital of @entity10			1
far different from @entity98 's flagship interactive @entity97 store , the @entity95 is retro and authentic with furniture sourced from flea markets and antiques galore .			0
