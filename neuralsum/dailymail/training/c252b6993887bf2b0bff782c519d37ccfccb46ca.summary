the statistics obtained by the @entity25 also found some @entity27 trusts are spotting only a third of all cases			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ as with cancer in the past , too many health professionals are not aware of the symptoms			2
some even believe that without effective cure there is no point putting people through the anxiety of a memory test – even though drugs can help stave off the condition for several years			2
‘ it is a grim fatalism we need to shake off			0
not just within our @entity43 but in society as a whole			0
’ if dementia sufferers are given drugs such as @entity49 and @entity50 early enough , the progression can be slowed by a year – possibly longer			1
patients and their loved ones can also be offered vital care and support to help them come to terms with the debilitating illness			0
