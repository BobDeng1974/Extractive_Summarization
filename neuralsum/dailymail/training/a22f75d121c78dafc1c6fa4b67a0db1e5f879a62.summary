scouse girls typically need at least two make - up wipes to remove their war paint every day , or 730 over the course of a year , the research found			2
the poll found 45 per cent of girls from @entity9 have regularly gone to bed with a full face of make - up and a third of those have kept it on for the next day after a quick touch - up			1
girls from @entity46 and @entity47 were more likely to don false eyelashes and @entity50 females wear the most fake tan			1

celebrity make - up artist @entity80 said : ' @entity82 trends come and go just as they do with fashion or hairstyles			0
' some seasons the subtle , natural look is favoured , but on other occasions a more heavy , dramatic look like this season 's red lips , fuller lashes and bright eye shadows			0
' there is nothing wrong with wearing make - up , as long as it is removed properly to ensure it does n't block pores or make skin look dull and lack luster			0
it 's equally important to create the right canvas so make - up looks its best which some women forget			0
' great make - up is n't just about applying it well ; it 's also about looking after your skin so a healthier complexion shines through			0
concerned : the study also found 25 per cent of all women worry about the amount of make - up they wear and believe they could be suffocating their skin ' we are all guilty of occasionally going to bed with make - up still on , but it 's really important not to do this regularly as it will take its toll on the skin			2

of the women polled by skincare brand simple , more than half said that women who wear a lot of make - up are trying too hard and 34 per cent said they are hiding who they really are			2
in contrast more than one in 20 felt they should wear more make - up to get ahead in their career			2
which is probably the reason why eight in ten women insist on applying make - up before they head to the office			1
half of women said they look 100 times better after they have applied make - up and 56 per cent said just a touch of make - up covers any blemishes			0
@entity80 added : ' it 's encouraging that women give their skin a bit of a break from make - up			0
' whilst make - up will create a cover for blemishes it wo n't help skin in the long run , especially if you are prone to problem or sensitive skin			0
name and shame : the poll named and shamed glamour girl @entity172 as having the worst make - up and @entity175 starlet @entity174 as the best ' there is no excuse to not look after your skin , it 's your insurance policy for the future - you only have one skin so look after it			0
