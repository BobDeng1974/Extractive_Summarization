@entity0 has just joined @entity1 for £ 21million - but @entity2 once rejected the chance to sign him for £ 100,000 ! former manager @entity4 travelled to @entity5 five years ago to scout the central defender , who was playing for @entity7 and available for a relative pittance			1
but chairman @entity9 , known for his parsimonious attitude to running the @entity11 , would n’t stump up the cash			1
from there the 27 - year - old centre half ’s career really took off and last july joined @entity32 for £ 10m			2
@entity0 had been heavily linked with @entity33 and @entity34 this summer before his switch to @entity1			1
it does present quite the turnaround for the player , who also failed to earn a move to @entity40 after an unsuccessful trial around the same time @entity4 was interested			1
this heaps more embarrassment on those at @entity45 , with the current incumbent @entity46 still at loggerheads with the club ’s hierarchy over the arrival of new players			0
they had just eight senior professionals in the middle of july and – despite a raft of signings on the cheap – still look threadbare			0
the only main target @entity59 has been allowed to land , @entity57 , is still struggling to obtain a work permit			0
@entity59 has seen his side lose all five competitive fixtures so far this campaign and is visibly frustrated at the lack of movement in the transfer market – despite the window shutting on monday			0
@entity1 not expecting to stroll past slumping @entity68			2

@entity0 joined @entity1 this week for £ 21m
@entity33 and @entity34 were interested in the defender
former @entity2 manager @entity4 noticed @entity73 five years ago
however , @entity2 chairman @entity9 would *n't* *pay* £ 100,000
