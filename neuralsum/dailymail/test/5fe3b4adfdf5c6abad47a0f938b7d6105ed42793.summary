@entity0 believes @entity2 team - mate @entity1 has gone from @entity4 scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in @entity7			1
@entity1 was one of the stars of @entity2 's @entity10 demolition of neighbours @entity11 on sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager @entity12			1
now @entity0 has revealed his admiration for the former @entity14 forward , saying : ' he is getting used in the right way			1
he is a handful for defenders to mark			2
@entity1 has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at @entity2 ' we like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option			1
' he is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch			1
he is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances			1
' @entity1 was signed from @entity14 by @entity34 's predecessor @entity33 in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player			1
@entity0 hailed his @entity39 team - mate as one of the best in world football at the moment @entity1 has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over @entity11 and @entity47 now the @entity39 has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under @entity34 , used as a second striker behind @entity0			1
on sunday , @entity11 could n't cope with him just as @entity47 had suffered at his hands at @entity51 three weeks earlier			1
' last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period , ' reflected @entity0			1
' he is showing now what he did at @entity14 and why @entity2 bought him			1
' he is a quality player			2
he is a different option for us			2
it is starting to show on the pitch			2
' it was tough for him but he had the whole team 's support			1
we knew he was working hard and it was n't just him struggling last season a lot of us were			2
' he was the one who took most of the blame for it			2
it was hard for him			2
thankfully the manager has shown faith in him			2
' he is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now			0
he is awkward to mark			0
it is great for him and we hope it continues			0
' @entity1 wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat @entity78 and give @entity2 the lead in the derby @entity2 are now in third place in the @entity82 after six league wins in a row			1
this weekend they travel to @entity85 with renewed hope			0
' we said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time , ' added @entity0			1
' it is starting to show now , the training we have been putting in			0
' we have been working really hard			0
' each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays			0
there is no detail left unturned			0
we have been prepared really well			0
' ' we are confident going to @entity85			0
' we are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams			1
it is a big test for us at @entity85			0
@entity12 suggested that @entity1 is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth ' they are top of the league and it is always tough at @entity109			1
they are in a very commanding position			0
we just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can			0
' we are still a work in progress			0
it is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue			2
' there is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack			0
we felt against @entity11 we could capitalise on it			0
we have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended			0

@entity1 has drawn *plaudits* for his recent performances
the @entity39 's form has *dramatically* *improved* in recent weeks
@entity1 endured a terrible start to his @entity2 *career* under @entity33
