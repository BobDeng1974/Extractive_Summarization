in a land where ‘ we ’re @entity6 ! ’ is the preferred chant from the little to the major leagues , the role of underdog is not overly prized			0
but maybe , just maybe , the @entity7 are learning to love the idea of someone else being the favourites			1
the battling defiance of their ‘ soccer ’ team at the @entity16 captured the imagination of a public reared on a diet of domination by the @entity21			1
or @entity21 , @entity21 , @entity7 , as the folks in the bleachers are wont to sing			1
now , as @entity24 leads a relatively inexperienced side into action against one of the most heavily favoured @entity29 teams in @entity31 history , they ’ve been presented with another opportunity to blow away all thoughts of meek capitulation			1
and , to use the famous military quote resurrected as a tribute to goalkeeper @entity37 holding the line in @entity39 , tell their critics : ‘ nuts ! ’ @entity43 says @entity21 's inexperience could actually help them in this year 's @entity31 according to one of the sharpest analysts in the game , this @entity7 team – a squad containing four rookies and not a single player from inside the world ’s top five – will actually benefit from their rawness			1
fewer @entity31 matches played , says @entity43 , means fewer scars from repeated exposure to hammerings by @entity29			1
swing guru @entity43 , who insists that the @entity7 are stronger without an out - of - form @entity59 dragging them down , bristles at the notion that this may be one of the worst @entity21 teams in history			1
‘ i would n’t say it ’s one of the weakest , i think it is one of the most inexperienced , ’ he said , adding : ‘ all of the players on the team are good players , all the players are very capable			2
‘ and i think the fact that it ’s an inexperienced team is good for the @entity7 , because these guys that have n’t played in a lot of @entity76 , quite frankly , are n’t used to getting their brains beat out by the @entity29 – unlike a lot of veterans			1
and that brings a lot of energy to the team			2
@entity83 has only played in one @entity31 , but could be his team 's key man at @entity86 ‘ these younger and less experienced players , they are n’t scarred			1
you go back to the 1999 – 2000 or 2001 , and look at what @entity59 did to @entity91 , @entity92 or @entity93 , where he just beat them every time , and time again			0
‘ you ’ve got @entity93 , @entity97 , @entity98 … you might have four or five at the most who played at @entity100 , who were there for that great comeback by the @entity29 team last time out			1
‘ these young kids , they were n’t there			0
they did n’t experience it , they watched it - and they want to be part of this next one to have a chance to be on the team that brings the @entity31 back			2
‘ you ’ve got @entity93 who has played in nine @entity76 , @entity97 who has played in eight , and after that @entity116 has only played in three , and then you go down to a lot of them are first - timers , while @entity83 , @entity98 , @entity121 , they ’ve all played in one apiece			2
@entity93 is the most experienced member of the @entity7 team , having played in nine @entity76 ‘ these young kids , they ’re not that far removed from playing in college where they are used to play as a team			1
when you look at the age of @entity83 at 25 , @entity128 at 24 , @entity123 is only 21			2
‘ so they understand the team atmosphere from their college days and that ’s why they ’re looking forward to it			2
they ’re all talking about “ man i get to put on the red , white and blue , this is the coolest thing			0
” ‘ and the other thing you can say about these young kids , they all played @entity137 together			0
they ’ve all been on @entity137 teams and they understand it			0
‘ @entity123 will be using the same putter cover he used in the @entity140 here - he said : “ i just want the good vibes i had the last time i was at @entity86			0
” ’ @entity43 describes the young @entity144 as ‘ really jacked up for this ’ , which presumably means they ’re quite keen to win			2
and to prove themselves comfortable in the distinctly un-american garb of unfancied outsiders			0
at just 21 , @entity151 is the youngest member of @entity21 's @entity31 team ‘ i think being an underdog gives you a little more incentive , it makes you want to show how good we are , ’ said @entity43 , who coaches @entity83 , @entity93 and @entity153			1
‘ i ’ve told @entity153 , who ’s never even attended a @entity31 before , that he ’s got to get ready for it , because it ’s the greatest thing you will ever do in your career ‘ i told my guys : “ embrace it			0
you ’re not ready for what you ’re going to hear , but embrace it			0
you know there ’s one way to quiet the crowd , just make a lot of birdies			0
” ‘ the @entity29 team , when you look at where they are in world rankings , is a very strong team and they will be heavily favourite			1
but as you know , you have to play the match on the golf course and not on paper			0
knowing all the guys on the team so well as i do , they ’re all very up for it			0
’ the @entity7 's have only won the @entity31 once in the last six attempts , their last win was in 2008 the @entity7 have often been accused of simply not buying into the team ethos , the friendly but very distinct us - and - them mentality , needed to triumph against the odds			1
none has been the target of these accusations more persistently than arch - individualist @entity59			0
so , does his absence – partly through injury , although also because he was playing so poorly as to make a captain ’s pick almost impossible for @entity24 , actually strengthen the away team ? @entity43 said : ‘ well the last time they won @entity59 was n’t on the team , whether they ’re stronger … they ’re stronger without @entity59 the way he ’s playing because he has n’t played well			1
obviously physically he could n’t play anyway			0
‘ but yeah , i do n’t think they lose anything by not having him at this point in time , because at this point in time he ’s not the @entity59 that we remember			0
’ @entity214 will ‘ @entity213 ’ from the @entity215 exclusively live on tv , mobile , online and via now tv including the @entity212			2

@entity29 heavy favourites for the @entity215
@entity7 team is relatively inexperienced , with a number of rookies
but @entity43 says @entity21 's inexperience could actually help them
@entity43 has coached @entity83 into the form of his career
