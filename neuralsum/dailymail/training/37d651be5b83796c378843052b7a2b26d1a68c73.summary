by @entity0 published : 00:57 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 16:16 est , 22 may 2012 mystery surrounds a savage attack on the wife of a top marine biologist after she apparently blamed her husband for the beating and then told police she had no memory of the assault			1
@entity10 , who is married to @entity11 , was left with a a fractured skull and still can not open her left eye six weeks after the attack in their @entity16 apartment			1
during early stages of her recovery , nurses ' notes allegedly show how the 46 - year - old @entity23 translator implicating her husband and asking for protection from him			0
the apparent claim led police to consider mr @entity11 , who claims he returned home from @entity28 to find her bloodied and twitching hurt but nothing stolen , as the only suspect			1
struggle recovering : @entity10 still can not form words and can not remember what happened to her when she was attacked in early april but now mrs @entity10 says that she has no memory of making such a request , the @entity35 reports			1
she has also asked to see her ocean expert spouse , who has appeared on the @entity40 tv show with @entity41			2
she is said to have smiled and reached for his hand when he was finally allowed to visit last friday , while accompanied by @entity35 reporter @entity44			0
she also says she does n't remember the days leading up to the assault , when she returned to the apartment while her husband was out of town , nor the attacker 's identity or how attack took place			1
what police do know is that on the afternoon of thursday april 5 , mrs @entity10 had been texting @entity54 , 25 , her daughter from a previous relationship , who now lives in @entity57			1
while messaging back and forth , they decided to speak later that night			0
but miss @entity54 's calls went unanswered			0
miss @entity54 then alerted her mother 's husband of 18 years the following day while he was in @entity28 , and he became concerned as well			1
the 53 - year - old says he arrived to their second - floor apartment @entity67 neighbourhood - and found the door dead - bolted - on the morning of saturday april 7			2
happier times : @entity10 , pictured before the brutal attack , and her husband of 18 years , @entity70 , pictured by the sea while doing his job as a marine biologist			2
they met in her home country of the then - @entity76 in 1991 one of the few certain facts is that mr @entity11 called police after the discovery of his wife lying on the floor beside their bed , wearing only a blouse and surrounded by blood and with a black eye			1
mrs @entity10 , who met her husband in her home country of the @entity76 in 1991 , was treated for a subdural hemotoma from the attack and is recovering from brain surgery			1
though her husband was initially allowed to sit at her bedside at @entity91 , police later barred him after seeing a note that a nurse wrote saying that she had requested protection			0
the only other family she has is miss @entity54 , who has visited twice from @entity57 over the past six weeks that her mother has been in the hospital			0
miss @entity54 made a video - posted on @entity99 by mr @entity11 - where she asks her bed - ridden mother if she wants her husband to be able to visit			1
mrs @entity10 , who can barely speak and has breathing and feeding tubes connected , nods and mouths ' yes '			2
work : mr @entity11 , an advocate for oceans , claims he has receipts to prove he was traveling when his wife was allegedly attacked famous : mr @entity11 being interviewed during a reef dive by 60 minutes host @entity41 continued effort : @entity10 had brain surgery and remains at @entity91 following the attack six weeks ago only her right eye is open as her left eye is still so swollen from a fracture that it remains shut			1
she is also recovering from a skull fracture and severe bruises on her upper arms , which doctors took as an implication that she was grabbed at some point during the attack			0
when she feels able , mrs @entity10 communicates by notes , or , as was the case when she was formally questioned by police and an assistant @entity130 attorney , a laptop			2
so far , those notes mostly make mentions of her feelings about the attack ( ' @entity135 horror ! sheer horror ! ' read one ) and messages to her husband ( ' they are supposedly keeping me safe from you ' she wrote in another after the ban was lifted )			0
the only other clue that remains is a cryptic message that @entity10 wrote to her daughter during one visit , where she implied that her attacker was an acquaintance			0
the exact wording of the message is unknown , and she did not identify the individual , but miss @entity54 is said to have brought it to the attention of the @entity130 attorney 's office			0
while investigators would like to think that note is the smoking gun of the case , their hopes have been thwarted as she now does not remember the person she mentioned			0
the case continues , and since the ban has been lifted by the police , her husband is at her side .			0

@entity10 ' told nurses that ocean expert husband @entity70 left her with fractured skull and other injuries '
now mrs @entity10 claims she has no memory of the attack - during which nothing was stolen from her apartment - or days before
mr @entity11 returned from @entity28 to @entity16 home a day after her daughter alerted him that no one was answering their phone
he found wife twitching and bloodied while lying on the floor in only a blouse
later mr @entity11 posted @entity99 video *filmed* by wife 's daughter in which his spouse indicated she did want to see him
