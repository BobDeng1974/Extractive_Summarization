by @entity0 published : 11:14 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 9 october 2013 @entity1 had something to share over brunch the other morning			1
' i 'm wearing a panty girdle , ' allowed the 85 - year - old personal shopping guru at the legendarily tony @entity7 on @entity8 - not a shocking revelation for a woman of a certain age who 's spent her life impeccably attired			1
' i 've never worn a panty girdle , ' replied her brunch companion and co-panelist , @entity17 , the 27 - year - old creator and star of @entity20 's girls			1
meeting of minds : @entity1 , the legendary personal shopper at @entity7 ( left ) appeared on a panel with girls creator @entity17 ( right ) on sunday ' i know ! ' replied @entity1			1
@entity23 laugh from the crowd			0
opposites may attract , but still , at first blush , it 's a little hard to imagine what would unite @entity1 , the no - nonsense @entity7 's doyenne who 's been catering to her well - heeled clientele for nearly four decades , and @entity17 , whose oft - scrutinized fashion choices - or , choices to wear little of anything at all on her show - seem as far from @entity1 's world as conceivably possible			1
but in a potentially delicious convergence of two radically different orbits , @entity17 and @entity1 , 58 years her senior , are coming together for a project based on @entity1 's life			1
@entity17 and co-writer @entity41 ( also of girls ) are slated to write a comedy series , currently in development at @entity20			1
whenever that might happen , it 's a proposition that raises lots of tantalizing style questions , as was clearly demonstrated at sunday 's brunch at @entity7 's @entity7 restaurant , an event put on by the @entity52 and moderated by fashion writer @entity53			0
' not my finest hour ' : @entity1 tells @entity17 that the eyeshadow she wore to the @entity55 made her eyes tear for example : jeans			1
@entity58 : ' i have to tell you , i 've never worn a pair of blue jeans in my life			1
i 've tried them on			0
they 're very uncomfortable ! ' @entity17 : ' true			2
' ' i 've never worn a pair of blue jeans in my life			1
i 've tried them on			0
they 're very uncomfortable ! ' or eye shadow			0
@entity58 : ' i told you , that blue eye shadow at the @entity55 made your eyes tear			0
' @entity17 : ' i know			2
the emmys were n't my finest hour			0
@entity58 : ' you realize that most people have never seen the back of themselves			0
they 've never used a double mirror			0
' @entity17 : ' maybe they do n't want to know			2
' @entity89 's controversial taste in fashion			0
@entity17 : ' i 've been told i have terrible taste			2
' @entity58 : ' who told you ? ' @entity17 : ' @entity95			2
' showing off her shorteralls : @entity17 pictured with @entity97 in a scene from season two of girls			2
both the actress and her character , @entity102 , are known for their unguarded approach to style the sunday crowd was a refreshing mix of @entity108 - undoubtedly clients of @entity1 - and younger fashion types closer to @entity17 's age			1
refreshing because each cultural subgroup seemed to appreciate the other			0
' there 's a pragmatic principle behind the way @entity58 dresses people , ' @entity17 said			1
' it 's very inclusive			0
there 's room for everyone in her process			0
' she also noted how @entity1 ' is able to be in the fashion world , but also take it down a peg at the same time			2
' in her ninth decade , the engaging , blunt - spoken @entity1 is enjoying a rash of publicity ; earlier this year she was highlighted in the documentary scatter my ashes at @entity7 's			1
she likes to tell how her adventures in personal shopping began			0
working initially at the second - floor @entity137 boutique , the store 's head came to her after a year and asked her why there was no record of any of her sales			0
retail legend : @entity1 is the 85 - year - old personal shopping guru at @entity7 on @entity8 turned out , she said sunday , she was letting others register her sales , because ' i did n't want to use the cash register			2
' even today , she notes , ' my hands have never touched a computer			0
' she asked the boss to set her up as a personal shopper , and the rest was history			0
of course , @entity1 does n't dress @entity17 , and she did n't say much about her clothes , though she did seem to like @entity17 's stylish red pointy boots			1
and they bonded over their nightgown collections - though @entity1 implied hers were private , whereas @entity17 said she liked to share hers on @entity156			1
and as for girls , the show that has made @entity17 one of the best - known young personalities on tv ? ' i 've never seen it , ' @entity1 said , without a trace of self - consciousness .			1

@entity17 is writing a comedy series for @entity20 based on @entity1 's life
the *discussion* saw @entity1 admit that she has never worn blue jeans , *prompting* @entity17 to *recommend* jeggings instead
