there were plenty of goals to keep everyone entertained in @entity5 's 5 - 3 win over @entity6			1
but goals was n't the only focus at @entity9 as @entity11 's @entity10 takes you through the talking points from @entity5 ' sensational @entity15 derby victory over @entity17 's outfit			1
@entity18 cancelled the @entity21 - @entity20 rematch after their on - field fight in the @entity26 - @entity25 clash last season failed to materialise			1
@entity6 's @entity21 ( right ) raises his hand to @entity5 's @entity29 following a tackle but the @entity33 - born @entity32 manager to make himself a nuisance nonetheless with @entity29 looking ready to floor him after one late challenge on 43 minutes – though perhaps wisely , he backed down fairly swiftly			1
more ref justice for @entity36 ? @entity17 was more animated than most of his players in his frequent berating of fourth official @entity40 in the second half , which reached a climax when @entity44 went down on 70 minutes			0
@entity6 boss @entity17 looks on with fury as he makes a point to the referee 's assistant but @entity20 looked as if he played the ball and @entity44 did n’t protest			1
@entity17 was quieter when @entity50 booted a grounded @entity51 on 75 minutes right in front of both benches			2
@entity54 at the break it was the fourth match of the @entity57 season so it was hardly surprising to see errors multiplying			0
@entity60 ( right ) was shrugged off with ease by @entity51 who would then fire home @entity5 's equaliser that said , the lacklustre way in which @entity60 and @entity67 attempted to defend against @entity51 as he made his run for the first - half equaliser was unforgivable			1
tired or not , their efforts were lame and @entity60 paid the price – substituted at half time			0
be a spurs legend , and go abroad @entity5 ’s pre-match video show , lauding the legends of the club , grandly announces in hushed tones : ‘ we are @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 … ’ @entity83 ( left ) was a @entity5 hero during the 1990s before a move to @entity85 soured his reputation with fans , but @entity82 is already regarded a @entity5 legend having departed to @entity89 given that the latter only left 18 months ago , it seems an indecently - short time in which to elevate him to the @entity5 pantheon , given the vitriol the likes of @entity83 and @entity96 received for leaving the club			2
if you want to leave a club and still be welcome , go abroad			0
@entity100 ( @entity101 ) at the lane @entity103 raised some eyebrows with his on - pitch interview paying tribute to the late @entity107 , the double - winning @entity5 left back who died aged 80 this week			0
@entity103 uses colourful language at @entity9 during a half - time interview , recalling how the late @entity107 would coach the team during his @entity5 playing days between 1978 and 1987 fondly remembering being coached by @entity107 at the club @entity103 recalled how he was not averse to ‘ giving you a bxxxxxing ’ – which was at least authentic if not entirely pre-watershed language			1
the @entity116 are taking over the @entity117 the @entity116 takeover of the @entity117 continues apace			0
when @entity120 came on , he joined @entity29 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity44 as the fifth player from that nation on the pitch			0
not that there was much love between the compatriots , given the rake down the back of the leg @entity132 gave @entity44			0
@entity116 duo @entity120 of @entity5 ( right ) and @entity6 's @entity44 tussle for the ball			2

@entity5 stunned @entity6 to triumph 5 - 3 at @entity9
@entity17 was *furious* at match officials throughout clash
@entity51 scored twice for @entity5 in @entity141 win
@entity21 and @entity20 avoid another on - field clash
