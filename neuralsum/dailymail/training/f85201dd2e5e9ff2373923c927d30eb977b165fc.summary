a bonfire society has been criticised for burning a ' distasteful and disrespectful effigy ' of @entity2			1
@entity3 burned a huge poppy display during their november 5 celebrations , leaving many spectators stunned			1
the fire club , based in the @entity9 town , claim the display was torched to commemorate the centenary of the @entity12			1
but many visitors were appalled at seeing the ten - foot - tall poppies being put to the torch during the annual @entity17 event			1
visitors were left shocked after an ' effigy ' of poppies was burnt at a bonfire event in @entity22 , @entity9 @entity23 , who attended the event , said : ' i am appalled at the choice of effigy			1
not only was it distasteful but disrespectful too			2
' if their intention was to celebrate the @entity29 , @entity3 were short - sighted			2
there was no consideration to the way this would have been inferred by others			0
' the local branch of the @entity36 also condemned the burning			1
president colonel @entity38 said : ' i raised the issue with officers of the @entity3			0
i was reassured that the purpose was to mark and remember			0
' i did not witness the burning but envisaged what might happen			0
' in my view the national symbol of @entity46 could have been given a prominent position at the event without destroying the display			2
' there are differing views of @entity46 , but to burn the symbol of sacrifice and @entity46 was , at best , naive and ill - judged			0
' while many were disgusted by the burning , some locals leapt to the defence of the society			2
@entity60 , from @entity61 , said : ' i was heartened to see the respectful commemoration			0
' organisers said : ' the tableaux was lit by red lances only and was not exploded , this was not an effigy ' visitors to the event said they were shocked by the move , which was branded ' distasteful and disrespectful ' @entity71 added : ' poppies in fireworks have been a feature of bonfire since the 1920 's			1
' as a descendant of a number of @entity78 who gave their lives for this country , i am shocked at the criticism of @entity3 in paying a tribute			0
' @entity3 issued a statement on monday , which said : ' the tableaux - created to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity12 - was made in remembrance and to raise the profile of the @entity2 and the good work the @entity36 does			1
' @entity90 was lit by red lances only and was not exploded , this was not an effigy			0
' @entity94 was not making a protest , nor was it making any statement other than to highlight @entity46 , and we very much regret any offence this may have caused			0
' the fact the tableaux was burned after discharge had no intended significance , any thinking differently that this was anything but an act of remembrance is regrettable			0
' @entity106 supports the @entity22 branch of the @entity36 in helping with the @entity46 service organisation and through donations and will continue to do so			2
' the @entity111 town has a long history of bonfire burning , which they say goes back to the time of the @entity116 some in the town have defended the move , saying it is a traditional way of remembering the war dead			1
