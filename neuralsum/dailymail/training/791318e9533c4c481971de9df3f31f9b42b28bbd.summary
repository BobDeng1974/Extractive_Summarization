by @entity0 published : 11:45 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 12:56 est , 18 april 2013 a pensioner who could n’t get an emergency dentist appointment for over a month was forced to pull out his own tooth with a pair of pliers			1
@entity6 , 73 , was forced to perform the procedure on himself after he was turned away from both @entity8 and private clinics			1
the retired teacher had been in agony for three months but heavy pain killers for arthritis had kept the pain at bay until it eventually it became unbearable			2
pensioner @entity6 , 73 , was in so much pain that he took dental matters into his own hands last month @entity6 went to one @entity8 dental centre and contacted several private clinics in @entity21 , @entity22 , but was told he would have to wait to have the tooth removed			1
‘ my wife phoned several private dentists but they could n’t fit us in or told us they were n’t licensed to perform extractions , ’ he said			0
the former soldier pleaded with staff to extract the molar because he feared blood - thinning drugs he was on could cause complications if it became infected			2
frustrated , @entity6 resorted to the @entity35 method and managed to pluck the tooth out in just 30 seconds			1
the offending molar ( pictured ) took less than half a minute to remove with a pair of pliers he said : ' the pain had been containable for a while due to the strong pain killers , but after a while it became too much for the drugs to control			1
' i went to the local @entity8 centre and was told i did n’t need an appointment after five - but that they did n’t perform extractions after that time either			0
' ‘ i got so fed up that i decided to do it myself with a pair of pliers i bought recently ' it was just a few moves inwards , then outwards , a few little cracks and clicks and then 30 seconds later it was out			0
’ and rather than being in excruciating pain after performing the procedure , he claims he felt fantastic : ‘ once the tooth was out i felt like i was floating to the ground on a parachute of euphoria			2
’ shortly after mr @entity6 had pulled the tooth out , he tried to visit the dentist to ensure the wound was n’t in danger of infection , but he was put off by the waiting time			1
‘ i went with the tooth and my hole to the clinic just to have it checked over and make sure everything was okay , ’ he said			0
‘ but they told me the wait time was about four hours - so i just left			0
there have been no problems since , so i must have made a decent job of it			0
' @entity80 has approached @entity22 , who look after some but not all of the @entity8 emergency dental clinics in the area , for comment .			0

@entity6 *'s* tooth caused him agonising pain for three months
dentists said he must wait for treatment so he took matter into own hands
using a pliers he managed to remove the molar in less than a minute
despite his crude methods , he is now pain - free and able to get on with life
