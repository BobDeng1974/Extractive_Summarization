so it is official : @entity1 has gone the way of @entity3 and @entity4 , to seek a fresh challenge after lighting up the @entity6 in @entity8 red			1
during my 16 years at @entity10 , @entity3 and @entity4 were the three best strikers i played alongside ( @entity12 was not at his peak when i was making my way in the first team ) , but @entity1 was top of that all - star list			1
@entity1 used to do things on the pitch that were so audacious , you could only laugh in amazement			2
but now here ’s the question : will he get the same kind of adulation in @entity25 as he did at @entity26 ? hero worship : @entity1 was idolised by @entity8 fans during his time at @entity26 spanish fly : @entity8 striker has completed a £ 75million move to @entity33 unloved : @entity4 and @entity3 ( r ) never found the same love after leaving @entity8 or will he end up like @entity3 and @entity4 , searching for affection and struggling to replicate the devastating goals - per - game ratio they had in their @entity40 pomp ? there was a reason @entity3 and @entity4 never recreated what they had done for @entity8			1
our team was built around them and , in @entity48 , they had someone to supply them with killer balls ; their pace was perfect for @entity53 and @entity54 , who liked to destroy teams on the counter-attack			0
@entity1 was afforded a similar indulgence			0
do n’t forget @entity58 jettisoned @entity59 as soon as he arrived in 2012 and constructed a side around his no 7			0
@entity1 was good for @entity58 with the goals he scored but , equally , @entity58 was good for @entity1 and gave him licence to roam			0
clearly , @entity1 can be a star for @entity33			1
he has the ability to play with any player and thrive for any club but it is not a given , by any means , that he will simply turn up in @entity69 and replicate what he was doing for @entity8			0
for all that we admire @entity33 , for all that we have marvelled at how tiki - taka has changed our perceptions of how the game should be played , they are not an easy team to play for — you do n’t just pull on that distinctive jersey and join in the fun , particularly if you are a striker			2
centre of attention : @entity58 built his @entity8 team around the 27 - year - old @entity84 : @entity1 is unlikley to displace @entity85 as the main man at @entity33 look at @entity87			1
he is arguably the @entity6 ’s greatest player , certainly the best i played against , but he never showed the same wow factor after he left @entity90			0
yes , he won seven trophies , including the @entity92 , but he had a strict role to play on the left wing			0
strikers who are brought into @entity33 do n’t get the option of operating through the middle because that is the domain of @entity85			2
he is the king , the man around whom this particular team is built and others have to tailor their game accordingly			0
think about it : @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 — all brilliant attackers , all undisputed match - winners , but none of them flourished alongside @entity85			1
even @entity111 , for all his brilliance and the trophies he won , became frustrated towards the end of his time at @entity33 playing second fiddle to @entity85			1
second fiddle : @entity87 and @entity103 struggled under @entity85 's shadow at the @entity25 boy from @entity118 : @entity104 new in town : @entity1 phenomenon : @entity85 the system is what matters and you can see that from the decision to let @entity125 , who looked to be @entity127 ’s natural heir , join @entity128			1
so where will @entity1 fit in ? a front three of @entity1 , @entity85 and @entity104 sounds like it has come straight from the computer game @entity134 but it will be fascinating to see how @entity135 , the new man in charge at @entity25 , juggles the demands when @entity1 is available			1
@entity85 ’s position is not up for debate and @entity104 plays from the left , as @entity1 would like to			2
does that mean he goes out on the right ? @entity1 played out wide for @entity8 on occasions , and did the job well , but he knew he would n’t do it every week and also had the freedom to roam			2
is playing in a specified position something @entity1 will accept and adapt to or is something that will take the edge off his spontaneous , impulsive brilliance ? wrong city ? the @entity8 may have been better off moving to @entity151 i thought a move to @entity151 would have been more natural for him			1
yes , @entity155 is the star but @entity1 is a better player than @entity156 and he would have played in his rightful position — straight down the middle			0
@entity8 will desperately miss him , there can be no disputing that , but the time was right for him to leave and the club have got the best cash deal they could , as was the case when @entity4 headed to @entity128 in january 2011			2
what they must make sure does not happen is falling into the trap @entity168 did 12 months ago of spending a giant windfall on players about whom nobody is sure where they play or what they do			0
they have to use this finance to build on the foundations @entity1 helped lay last season .			0

@entity1 has completed a £ 75m transfer from @entity8 to @entity33
@entity182 striker may not receive the same adulation at the @entity25
@entity3 and @entity4 were unloved after leaving @entity26
@entity1 is unlikely to displace @entity85 as the main man in @entity187
@entity87 , @entity105 , @entity111 and @entity103 have struggled under @entity85 's shadow
@entity151 may have been a better move
