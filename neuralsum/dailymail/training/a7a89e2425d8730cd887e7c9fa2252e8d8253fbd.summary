by @entity0 published : 22:38 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 04:15 est , 12 march 2013 @entity3 's inability to deport hate preacher @entity4 shows the controversial @entity5 is ‘ working ’ , a senior @entity1 minister has claimed			1
in an astonishing intervention , justice minister @entity6 said the legal protection given to the man once dubbed @entity11 ’s right - hand man in @entity12 was ‘ part of what makes us a civilised society ’			1
his comments came as the government made a fresh attempt to deport the 52 - year - old radical preacher , who is facing trial in his native @entity22 for terrorism offences			1
intervention : minister of state for justice @entity6 , pictured left , claims the legal protection preventing the deportation of radical cleric @entity4 , pictured right , is what makes @entity3 a ' civilised society ' @entity32 lawyers said he was a ‘ truly dangerous individual ’ whose views ‘ encompass the legitimacy of attacking people in the @entity3 ’			1
the seven - year bid to deport @entity4 , who claimed asylum in @entity3 in 1993 , has cost taxpayers more than £ 500,000 in legal aid alone			1
@entity42 critics , including @entity43 and @entity44 may frequently highlight his case as evidence that the government should scrap @entity48 ’s @entity5 , or even withdraw from the @entity49			2
but @entity6 said people should be ‘ reassured ’ by the fact that even terror suspects like @entity53 were protected by the law			1
he told @entity58 @entity57 ’s @entity56 ’s politics show : ‘ the fact is , in my mind , if the @entity5 occasionally comes in favour of somebody who is not very likeable in terms of what they have done or who they are ... that to me is a reassurance , that if even he is given the protection of our law and @entity5 then all the more the rest of us are going to be protected by it as well			2
legal battle : the seven - year bid to deport @entity74 cleric @entity4 has so far cost taxpayers more than £ 500,000 in legal aid ‘ the law is there to protect us all and sometimes it protects those least worthy of its protection , but the fact its protection is there is part of what makes us a civilised society			1
’ asked about calls for the @entity5 to be scrapped he added : ‘ if it ’s working , why try and fix it ? i do n’t see the great travesties being done			0
’ @entity42 mp @entity92 last night condemned @entity6 ’s ‘ offensive ’ comments			2
mr @entity92 said : ‘ he is completely wrong			0
it is quite extraordinary that we should have a justice minister who holds these views , which many people will find offensive			1
@entity6 argued that the public should be ' reassured ' that everyone is protected by the law ‘ we should be putting @entity53 on a plane tonight and worrying about the legal consequences later - that is what the vast majority of @entity3 people want us to do			1
the only people supporting him are terrorists , rich barristers and the @entity1			0
‘ the fact that we have a justice minister who holds these views just confirms my fears that we are in coalition with a bunch of clowns			1
’ the row came as lawyers for the home secretary asked the @entity120 to overturn a decision to allow @entity53 to remain in the @entity3			0
the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) decided last november that @entity53 could not lawfully be deported to @entity22 , where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in @entity127 judges ruled there was a ‘ real risk ’ that evidence obtained by torture , could be used against him in a retrial in @entity22			0
he was released from prison subject to a 22 - hour curfew regime			2
the security bill for monitoring him is estimated at £ 100,000 per week			0
@entity140 , appearing for mrs may yesterday , said the decision could not stand because @entity122 had taken an ‘ erroneous ’ view of the position in @entity22			0
mr @entity144 said the evidence was that ‘ @entity22 law prohibits clearly and expressly the use of torture and the reliance on any statement obtained under duress , including torture ’			0
lawyers for @entity53 said the appeal should be refused as mrs may ’s legal advice was wrong and there was a genuine risk that confessions obtained by torture would be used against their client			0
the appeal came three days after @entity4 was arrested for breaching bail conditions			2
the court was told he had been detained after mobile phones and communication devices were found in his home as part of an ongoing @entity169 investigation			0
reserving judgment , @entity170 said the court would take time to consider its decision .			0
