an auction house is providing a rare opportunity to buy a 500 - year - old piece of natural history by selling bones from a dodo bird for the first time in 80 years			1
the leg and pelvis from the flightless bird , which died out in the mid- 17th century , represent the first opportunity to purchase a complete part of the animal 's skeleton since 1934			1
the anonymous vendor is believed to be one of only three people left in the world who privately own dodo bones , with most now on display in museums			0
rare opportunity : the leg ( left ) and pelvis bone ( right ) from the extinct dodo are the first on sale since 1934 the pair were part of a large collection of remains discovered by a @entity33 schoolmaster 220 years after the bird became extinct			1
in 1886 @entity35 went to @entity36 , the only place the dodo is said to have lived , and hired slaves to wade through a swamp and feel for the bones with their feet			1
the leg and pelvis , which are being sold by @entity45 in @entity46 , are said to be worth more than £ 30,000 together and are both in excellent states of preservation			1
earlier this year , a fragment of a femur was sold for £ 8,000 by auction house @entity51 in @entity52			0
dodos were first spotted by @entity55 sailors who arrived on the @entity57 isle in 1598 , but the final sighting was only 64 years later in 1662			1
sparse : a replica skeleton of a dodo			2
only 10 museums around the world are set to have sets of dodo bones , but most are composites while it is thought they were hunted to extinction by humans , another belief is that macaque monkeys plundered dodo nests after being introduced on @entity36			1
@entity74 , a natural history expert and curator for the auction , said : ' most dodo bones that exist today were found in a swamp in @entity36 by @entity35			1
' the remains went to museums and private collectors but over the years they have gradually gravitated to museums			2
' only about 10 museums in the world have a complete dodo skeleton and most of them are composites			2
' physical remains of the bird in private hands today hardly exist			2
there are only two or three people in the world privately who have dodo bones			0
drawing : the dodo ( or @entity97 ) was first spotted by @entity55 sailors who arrived on @entity36 in 1598 ' the last complete dodo bone was sold in 1934 in @entity52			1
there will be a lot of interest in these two items			0
there are dodo fans all over the world and there are lots of them			0
around 200 years after they had died out , dodo birds started to gain a mythical status due to @entity113 author @entity112			0
he was inspired to write the creature into @entity115 after seeing the head of one at a museum in @entity119			0
mr @entity74 added : ' the dodo was so extreme looking yet nobody really took much notice of them until the 1860s when @entity112 wrote about one in @entity115			0
' that generated an interest in the bird that has never ceased			0
if you go to @entity36 today you can by souvenir dodo t - shirts and ashtrays			2
' and of course the dodo is regarded as a symbol of extinction , mainly due to the saying ' dead as a dodo			0
