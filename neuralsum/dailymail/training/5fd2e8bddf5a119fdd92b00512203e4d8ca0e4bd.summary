the chances of heatwaves in @entity3 have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures , experts have said			2
extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now likely to happen twice a decade , a new study from the @entity7 found			1
the chances of extreme heatwaves , such as the one in 2003 which led to tens of thousands of deaths across @entity3 , have also increased tenfold , from a one in 1,000 year event to around one in a century			1
the @entity7 says the chance of warmer weather is predicted to increase due to climate change			1
warm summers and heatwaves ( @entity21 shown in 2003 ) will increase ten-fold , they say			1
warm summers will increase from twice a century to twice a decade , while extreme heatwaves will occur once a century by the 2040s , such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , the research published in the journal @entity24 found			1
the study is an update of research carried out in 2004 into the heatwave the previous year			0
it found the likelihood of it happening again has at least doubled as a result of human activity , such as burning fossil fuels			0
despite a slowdown in rising global temperatures since the late 1990s , the new study found summer temperatures in central and @entity3 affected by the 2003 heatwave had increased by @entity44 ( 1.4 ° f ) between the 1990s and the period 2004 to 2013			2
2014 is on course to be the hottest year on record not just in the @entity21 but across the entire globe , experts claim			0
@entity21 temperatures from the beginning of january to late november were 1.6 ° @entity51 ) above the long - term average , making it the warmest since records began in 1910 , the @entity7 said			0
the scorching temperatures mean only an @entity55 - like december - which would have to be one of the ten coldest ever - could stop this year from topping the table			0
the prediction comes as figures reveal that global temperatures for this year are also above the long - term average from january to october , heralding a warning from experts that the threat from climate change is real			2
the rises have increased the chances of summer heatwaves , defined as having temperatures of 1.6 ° @entity51 ) above the long - term average , and extreme hot weather events such as the summer of 2003 , which was @entity72 ( 4.1 ° f ) above the 1961 - 1990 average			2
dr @entity74 , lead author of the new paper , said : ' extremely warm summers that would occur twice a century in the early 2000s are now expected to happen twice a decade			1
' moreover , the chances of heatwaves as extreme as seen in 2003 have increased from about one in a 1,000 to about one in a 100 years and are projected to occur every other year by the 2030s to 2040s under continuing greenhouse gas emissions			1
' dr @entity83 , co-author of the study , said : ' this paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward			0
' he said that projections of future changes to the climate suggest that by the end of the century , summers as hot as 2003 could be considered ' unusually cool '			2
both the 2004 study and the latest research looked at the same region , covering parts of central and @entity3			0
it did not cover the @entity21			0
although the @entity21 was less severely affected by the 2003 heatwave , extremely hot summers are also expected to become more common here as a result of a warming climate			0
in 2003 , an extreme heatwave killed tens of thousands of people in @entity3			1
shown here is the temperature difference in 2003 compared to 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2004			0
if emissions continue to rise , the occurrence of such heatwaves could increase further to every other year by the 2040s			1

the @entity7 says the chance of warmer weather in @entity3 is predicted to increase due to climate change
warm summers will increase from twice a century to twice a decade
heatwaves will occur once a century rather than once a *millennium*
in 2003 an extreme heatwave killed tens of thousands of people in @entity3
and if emissions continue to rise , the occurrence of such heatwaves could increase further to every other year by the 2040s
