by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 14 may 2013 as my grandson raced up the drive towards us and hurled himself into @entity6 ’s waiting arms , i looked at my husband ’s face and had to catch my breath			1
as he threw @entity13 into the air , the look of utter love and adoration was magical			1
why ? well , my husband is notoriously formidable and high - achieving			1
@entity6 is a former leader of the @entity16 — and is remembered for his uncompromising stance on crime and prison reform			1
yet these days , he receives the most profound joy from the simple pleasure of lifting a squealing three - year - old into the air ( complete with jet engine noises )			1
devotion : @entity0 with her husband @entity6 and their three - year - old grandson jasper @entity6 has locked horns with the @entity31 ’s chief rottweiler @entity30 and earned the respect of @entity33 — no mean feat. but today , give him a jigsaw , a stretch of lawn and a football , or a great cupboard for a game of hide - and - seek , and he shines with a brilliance quite removed from anything seen in his professional life			1
little children bring great men down to size			1
but they also bring out the softest , gentlest — dare i say , the best — side in even the most powerful , formidable males			1
that ’s why , when i saw the photos of sir @entity54 surrounded by his brood of grandchildren , on the week he announced his retirement from @entity58 , i had to smile			1
there is something completely entrancing about seeing a powerful man — an @entity61 , if you will — transformed into a cuddly grandad			1
but a life as a cuddly grandad is what @entity6 — and sir @entity54 — have worked their whole lives for			1
this is the down - time they deserve			1
the football plaudits , the political accolades , the entry in @entity75 — none of them compare with the satisfaction of being surrounded by people who love you simply for being ‘ grandpa ’			1
we have four grandchildren — two from my son ( @entity6 ’s stepson ) @entity83 : @entity85 , 14 , and @entity86 , 12 , and two from our daughter @entity88 : @entity89 , three , and @entity90 , five months			1
he ’s been a terrific grandpa to them all			1
and — while i adore them all to bits — when it comes to being a doting and devoted grandparent , my husband has me beaten hands down			1
try as i might , i ’m far too impatient to get involved in all the games they want to play or answer the endless stream of questions that come from nowhere and go round in circles			1
maybe @entity6 ’s better prepared than me : he did study @entity107 at @entity108 , after all , and has sat through endless rounds of debate in both the @entity111 and the @entity112			1
who would have thought they would provide such good training for grandparenting ? another well - known grandad : former @entity58 manager sir @entity54 celebrates with his grandchildren after the club sealed victory in the @entity121 in a match against @entity123 last week as anyone who knows him well will tell you , @entity6 is one of the most impatient men on @entity127			1
if there ’s a book he wants to read , he ca n’t wait to get his hands on it straight away , often before he ’s even sat down			1
and if he has an appointment to get to , there ’s no way he will be late			1
it ’s the one characteristic he deplores in me — i ’m the worst timekeeper in the world			1
but when it comes to his grandchildren , his patience is infinite			1
while i itch for a distraction , @entity6 will sit on the floor and fit the same piece of jigsaw into the puzzle over and over again			1
he has spent endless hours patiently teaching @entity89 to throw and catch a ball			1
when we ’re out for a pizza and @entity89 ’s getting fractious , he knows exactly how to distract him — with a game of pyramids where he ’ll put one hand on top of @entity89 ’s and so on , seeing who can pull their hand out first			1
if only @entity30 had been so easy to deal with			1
we get the most bemused looks from other diners — fascinated that this man they recognise from weighty debates on @entity161 should be such an old softie			2
being a grandpa brings out the little boy that lurks in most men			2
take the first time @entity13 came for a sleepover at our house			2
he was just two and was beside himself with excitement when @entity6 promised him a trip on the little steam train that chugs through the @entity173 near our home			2
he was so excited the waiting was torture — for me at least			2
‘ when are we going on the train ? ’ @entity13 asked at five - minute intervals			2
‘ soon , ’ i replied with increasing levels of frustration			2
@entity6 , however , did n’t turn a hair and cheerfully fielded the same question over and over again			2
a politician is used to such relentless grilling			2
i do n’t know which of them was more excited as the train finally set off			2
‘ all aboard , ’ @entity13 yelled			2
it took me a few seconds to work out where @entity13 had picked up that particular phrase			2
he ’d heard it in the @entity198 stories , which @entity6 loves to read to him			1
another grandfatherly job he fulfils with great aplomb — down to doing all the voices			1
when @entity13 was n’t yelling ‘ all aboard ’ , he was excitedly pointing out all the sheep in the fields			2
and , believe me , there were hundreds			2
‘ @entity207 , ’ he squealed			2
i was exhausted just listening to it all			0
@entity6 revels in being teased			0
like most grandparents we have made a habit of telling @entity89 that he is a good boy			0
‘ very good @entity89 , ’ we ’ll tell him when a job has been well done			0
now he loves turning the tables			0
‘ very good , @entity216 , ’ he will announce when he manages to beat @entity214 at football			0
and , yes , my highly competitive husband does allow his three - year - old grandson to beat him sometimes			1
but that does n’t mean he ’s a total pushover			0
@entity89 adores playing hide - and - seek			0
sadly , he ’s yet to grasp the concept of hiding			0
when he stands in the middle of our garden , ‘ hiding ’ in full view , @entity6 explains , patiently : ‘ no @entity89 , that really is n’t hiding you know			0
’ as a former barrister , even his worst enemy could n’t accuse @entity6 of being an intellectual slouch			0
yet , despite his powerful intellect , he finds it very easy to get into the mindset of a very small child			0
when @entity13 ’s baby brother @entity90 was born at @entity238 , @entity6 was acutely aware that @entity13 might feel jealous			0
his solution ? to give @entity89 an extra-special role as a big brother			0
one of the loveliest things is watching the pair of them plotting how they are going to get the baby up to scratch			0
a few evenings ago i caught them deep in conversation			0
‘ do you think you ’ll be able to help me to teach @entity90 how to throw a ball ? ’ @entity6 was asking solemnly			0
nodding his head , @entity13 looked so proud			0
but the truth is that @entity6 has always been a family man			0
it ’s one of the things i love most about him			0
he took his share of nappy - changing when our two children were babies and i have an image of him winding them over his shoulder while reading government papers , before going off to @entity263 with baby sick on the shoulder of his suit			0
@entity267 : mr @entity268 speaks to the @entity111 as @entity269 during @entity270 in july 2004 but now he ’s semi-retired , like sir @entity54 , he at last has time to devote to his family			1
i know his unbounded adoration of his grandchildren causes some raised eyebrows			0
for example , as a member of the @entity112 , he was offered two tickets to watch the flotilla for the @entity279 last summer : one for a guest , one for a child under five			0
he was desperate to bring @entity89 and was frustrated on being told that , as his grandchild rather than his child , @entity13 could n’t attend			0
‘ but surely the invitation should apply to grandchildren , ’ he argued			0
‘ after all , how many members of the @entity112 have children under five ? ’ he won his point and both @entity88 and @entity89 accompanied him			0
@entity13 spent the entire time on @entity6 ’s shoulders yelling : ‘ come on boats			0
’ if @entity6 was proud to be part of the procession that wet and so very @entity294 day , he was even prouder to share it with his grandson			0
i ’ve no doubt @entity299 will have plenty of plans for sir @entity54 on his retirement			0
and , as they will discover , the joys of retirement are many			0
their hours will be theirs again , and theirs to enjoy , as grandparents			0
i ca n’t think of a nicer way to reward a job well done .			0
