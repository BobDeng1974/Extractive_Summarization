a healthy lifestyle may do more than simply slow the ageing process			1
it could actually reverse it			0
keeping physically fit , having a plant - based diet and practising stress - reduction techniques such as yoga could extend the lifespan of cells , researchers say			1
they studied the effect of healthy living on lengths of @entity13 called telomeres – tiny ‘ caps ’ on the ends of chromosomes that protect against the ageing process			1
just as the tips of shoelaces prevent fraying , telomeres keep chromosomes stable and prevent deterioration when the cells containing them divide			2
secret to a longer life ? researchers found that subjects who ate a healthy diet and used stress reduction techniques such as yoga , stock image pictured , had longer telomeres ( lengths of dna which shorten as we age ) than those who did n't dubbed the ‘ chromosomal clock ’ , they shorten as we age			1
this process is associated with a greater risk of early death and of conditions such as heart disease , dementia , diabetes and cancers , as well as with increased vulnerability to infection			2
scientists believe the shortening process may even place an unextendable limit on the human lifespan			2
the pilot study , published in @entity53 , compared two groups of men with early non-aggressive prostate cancer who had not undergone surgery or radiotherapy but were having regular checks			0
one group of 25 men continued without making any changes			0
ten others underwent a radical lifestyle transformation supervised by doctors , nutritionists and psychologists			2
their diet was switched to one high in plant proteins , fruits , vegetables and unrefined grains while low in fat and processed carbohydrates			0
they were taught stress reduction techniques such as yoga and meditation , and were given counselling			1
they also took moderate levels of exercise , such as walking for 30 minutes , six days a week			0
after five years , blood tests showed that the telomeres of the healthy - lifestyle group had lengthened by an average of 10 per cent , effectively reversing the natural ageing process			1
but the telomeres of the group who continued with their previous lifestyle shortened by an average of 3 per cent			1
the study found no significant difference between the groups in the progress of prostate cancer			2
but the scientists believe that their findings carry an important health message with wider implications			0
the team ’s leader , professor @entity102 , from the @entity104 at the @entity105 in @entity106 , said : ‘ the implications of this relatively small pilot study may go beyond men with prostate cancer			0
‘ if validated by large - scale randomised controlled trials , these comprehensive lifestyle changes may significantly reduce the risk of a wide variety of diseases and premature mortality			1
our genes , and our telomeres , are a predisposition , but they are not necessarily our fate			0
’ dr @entity120 of the @entity121 said : ‘ this new study suggests that reducing stress , improving diet and increasing exercise not only prevent telomere loss but also lead to small but significant increases in telomere length			1
‘ it is perhaps too soon to judge whether this increase will correlate with increased longevity or healthspan			0
overall , though , the findings of this paper support the calls for adoption of and adherence to healthier lifestyles			0

researchers studied the effect of healthy living on lengths of @entity13 called telomeres which protect against the ageing process
telomeres shorten as we age and make us more vulnerable to infections
they found those who led a healthier lifestyle and used stress - reducing techniques has longer telomeres than those who did n't
