only the quick thinking of a pilot averted a similar tragedy last year when a sister plane of the @entity5 jet suddenly lost altitude and nose - dived			1
a @entity7 – a longer version of the @entity9 – unexpectedly descended 3,000ft while cruising over @entity10 , @entity11 , last november			0
the jet , with 109 passengers and crew aboard , was at an altitude of 31,000ft when it started to lose height			1
the flight crew managed to regain control at 28,000ft			0
in that incident , the problem was corrected by the pilot according to the @entity30 , a safety system designed to protect the jet reacted to incorrect data due to a faulty sensor			1
the safety warning related to all @entity34 , @entity9 , @entity9 and @entity35 – including the @entity9 involved in today ’s disaster			1
in response , @entity20 created a ‘ temporary revision ’ to all of the aircraft 's flight manuals			2
the @entity30 determined that the @entity7 aircraft 's @entity43 probes got blocked while flying between @entity44 and @entity45			2
the @entity30 warned that in such a situation ' the flight control laws order a continuous nose down pitch rate that , in a worst case scenario , can not be stopped with backward sidestick inputs , even in the full backward position			0
' the agency added : ' this condition , if not corrected , could result in loss of control of the aeroplane			2
' a similar @entity20 plane to that involved in today 's crash was put down in the @entity61 , @entity62 in 2009 in that incident , the pilot managed to crash land in the river and the passengers were saved after a bird strike the @entity7 involved in the previous incident is a slightly longer version of the plane involved in today 's crash , carrying an extra 40 passengers			1
@entity5 today confirmed that today 's downed aircraft underwent a major inspection at @entity7 in summer 2013 while it was last checked yesterday			1
the plane that crashed was called ' @entity76 ' and made its first test flight in november 1990			2
it was then purchased by @entity7 and had its first commercial flight in february 1991			0
experts said the aircraft would have been nearing the end of its commercial life after more than 24 years of service			0
since the first version of the @entity9 was released in 1987 , around 4,000 have been built and the company say one takes off or lands somewhere in the world every 2.5 seconds			2
the @entity9 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation			2
worldwide , 3,606 @entity92 are in operation , according to @entity20			1
the a320 family has a good safety record , with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million take - offs , according to a @entity99 safety analysis			1
the safest part of a flight is when the plane is at cruise elevation			2
just 10 per cent of fatal accidents occur at that point			2
in contrast , take - off and the initial climb accounts for 14 per cent of crashes , while final approach and landing accounts for 47 per cent			0
the @entity9 is certified to fly up to 39,000ft , its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode			0
however , the widely - used @entity9 family of aircraft have been involved in a number of crashes in the three decades they have been used , resulting in scores of deaths			1
in december an @entity9 crashed into the @entity123 killing all 162 people on board in an as - yet unexplained incident			0
the plane operated by @entity128 – owned by @entity130 chairman @entity129 – vanished from radar screens in bad weather with initial reports suggesting it climbed so fast into a storm that it lost lift and plunged into the sea			1
one the first accident to involve one of the planes happened in the north east of @entity143 , not far from the current crash site , when an @entity146 flight came down in the @entity148 mountains in 1992			0
the @entity9 was on its approach to @entity151 airport when it hit @entity152 , killing 87 of the 96 people on board			0
safe : aviation experts tweeted this graphic showing just how many @entity92 are in the air at any time the best - known recent incident involving the plane was when a domestic flight in the @entity162 had to put down in the @entity61 in @entity62			1
the @entity164 flight from the city 's @entity165 heading for @entity167 , @entity168 when it is believed to have flown into a flock of geese			0
the @entity9 like that involved in today 's accident is a short - haul , narrow - body airliner assembled in @entity143 , @entity176 and @entity177			1
around 4,000 of the single - aisle aircraft have been built and @entity20 says the plane ' sets industry standards for comfort and operating economy on short - to medium - haul routes '			0
it typical seats around 150 passengers depending on the layout of the plane and has a cruising speed of 511mph and a range of up to 7,500 miles			0
it was ranked as the world 's fastest selling aircraft bewteen 2005 and 2007 when it became popular with low - cost airlines			1
captain @entity196 was widely praised for landing the plane on the river , meaning none of the 155 people on board were seriously injured			1
one of the deadliest accidents involving one of the planes was in may 2006 , when @entity205 crashed into the sea near @entity207 , @entity208			0
all 113 passengers and crew on the @entity211 died after it flew into terrible weather while approaching the southern @entity208 city after taking off from @entity215 , @entity216			0
six years earlier , 143 people , including two @entity218 , lost their lives when a @entity221 @entity220 went down in the @entity222 after a three - long flight from @entity224			0
a number of factors were blamed for the night - time crash , including pilot error and poor training of staff			1
an @entity9 was involved in a crash near @entity207 , @entity208 in 2006 which killed 113 passengers and crew			1

air safety agency sent out *directive* warning operators to be aware
pilot in that incident pulled the plane out of the dive averting problems
