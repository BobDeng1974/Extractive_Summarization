president @entity1 's claim that a gunman who last month killed four @entity4 jews inside a kosher deli ' randomly ' selected the location and his targets came under heavy scrutiny today at a @entity10 briefing , with multiple reporters badgering the president 's spokesman to admit a tie between the victims ' religion and their murders			1
in an interview with @entity19 published on monday @entity1 said , ' it is entirely legitimate for the @entity22 people to be deeply concerned when you ’ve got a bunch of violent , vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in @entity30			1
' today the @entity31 argued that his boss merely meant to say they ' were not specifically targeted ' and ' were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli			1
' a journalist with the station says he also explained ' why he did this : to defend oppressed @entity60 ... notably in @entity61			0
' ' he claimed to be part of the @entity65 [ @entity66 ] very clearly , ' @entity48 reporter @entity62 said of the phone conversation with @entity47			0
' he said he had instructions from the caliphate			0
and then another very important element , evidently , as we were saying in the afternoon , he established a link with the @entity74 brothers			0
' @entity79 and @entity74 , the brothers allegedly behind the attack on the @entity30 - based satirical publication @entity78 , were later killed in stand off with police , as was @entity81			0
@entity47 's ties to @entity66 are documented by a propaganda video taped by his wife , possibly a co-conspirator in the grocery store siege , in which she calls for @entity4 @entity60 to carry out additional acts of terror			0
the @entity10 found itself in several testy back and forths with reporters this afternoon over @entity1 's statement - provided to @entity19 more than a week ago but released just yesterday			1
first asked about @entity1 's remark by @entity95 's @entity94 , @entity10 press secretary @entity38 replied , ' i believe the point that the president was trying to make is that these individuals were not specifically targeted			1
' he added : ' these were individuals who happened to randomly be in this deli and were shot while they were there			2
and that is the point that the president was making			0
' flabbergasted , @entity106 ' @entity105 pressed @entity38 to confirm that president believes the deli goers ' @entity3 heritage were related to the assault			2
' it is clear from the terrorists and some of the writings they 've put out afterward what their motivation was , ' @entity1 's spokesman told him			1
' the adverb that the president chose was used to indicate that the individuals who were killed in that terrible , tragic incident were killed not because of who they were , but because of where they randomly happened to be			0
' terrified hostages - including women and children - run for their lives as four captives die in dramatic end to siege at this @entity129 kosher grocery store last month not satisfied , @entity105 again pointed out that they were in a kosher deli when they were killed , moments later contending that even if they were n't personally targeted they were attacked because of their religion , to which @entity38 told him ' there were people other than just @entity3 who were in that ... deli			1
' ' does he have any doubt ... that deli was attacked because it was a kosher deli , it was not any random deli , it was a kosher deli , ' @entity105 eventually shouted at @entity38 , who interrupted him to say , ' no , ' @entity1 does not doubt that			2
picking up where @entity105 left off , seconds later @entity150 ' @entity10 correspondent @entity149 asked , why then , ' did n't the president acknowledge that ? if he knows that , and it 's obvious , why did n't he say that ? ' ' the president has acknowledged that on many occasions when he 's had the opportunity to speak about this incident , ' @entity38 tersely told him ' but he did n't there ! ' @entity149 noted before moving on to another topic .			2

in an interview released monday @entity1 referred to ' violent , vicious zealots who behead people or randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in @entity30 '
today the @entity10 argued @entity1 merely meant to say the victims ' were not specifically targeted ' and ' happened to randomly be in this deli '
the president 's spokesman eventually said that @entity1 has ' no ' doubt the grocery was selected because it was *frequented* by @entity3
but not before stating ' there were people other than just @entity3 who were in that ... deli '
