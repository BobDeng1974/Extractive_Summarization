@entity0 face @entity1 at the @entity2 in a match which could end their dream of winning their first @entity6 trophy			1
@entity8 's side have to better @entity10 's result against @entity11 if they are to make it through to the last - 16			1
here @entity13 analyses how @entity0 can claim all three points against their @entity16 opponents			1
get ready for the @entity17 @entity18 is an old - fashioned fighter of a midfielder			0
he plays with great aggression and i love the way he has stuck with @entity1			0
there must be something about the club that makes players want to stay			0
like his captain @entity27 , 31 - year - old @entity18 is a one - club man and the fans love him for it			1
before him i liked watching @entity30 , who spent 15 years at @entity1 , and i almost went there myself when @entity30 left			0
@entity18 loves snapping into tackles and he ’s good in possession			0
he is one of the finest defensive midfielders in @entity36 but @entity0 must be careful not to show him too much respect			1
if they do then he is capable of the kind of dominant display that will whip the crowd into a frenzy			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity18 is idolised at the @entity16 giants due to his commitment to the club @entity16 international @entity18 has turned down several moves to leave @entity1 throughout his career attacking options could be risky @entity49 has carried @entity0 at times this season but with him injured , @entity8 faces a selection headache			1
does he stick to his principles and play two up front or does he put an extra man in midfield ? @entity8 tends to be quite stubborn in the way he plays and though @entity57 can lead the line alone , he does n’t offer enough defensively			2
city must win so @entity8 might be tempted to go with @entity57 and @entity60 , but being too open is a big risk			2
@entity49 has been ruled out of @entity0 's @entity6 clash against @entity1 @entity0 forward @entity49 is expected to be out for up to six weeks after sustaining a knee injury beware @entity64 surely a 38 - year - old should not be capable of affecting a game of this magnitude ? think again			1
@entity27 is a living legend at @entity1			1
the fans worship the ground he walks on and he is playing in his theatre			0
it might be a cliche to call @entity27 a gladiator but that ’s how the fans see him			1
he is battle - hardened , and he knows just what it takes to win a game like this			0
he has never had to rely on speed because his brain is always one step ahead			0
he scored @entity1 ’s goal in the 1 - 1 draw at the @entity86 and this game could be decided by a single moment of genius			0
that ’s why @entity27 is such a threat — we know he is more than capable of producing one			1
@entity1 captain @entity27 will lead his side out against @entity0 on wednesday night @entity27 trains alongside @entity1 team - mates @entity95 and @entity18 during a pre-match training session @entity99 - @entity98 could leave @entity1 in ruins there is no guarantee he will play , but one man i would like to see starting for @entity1 is @entity105			1
he is a complete liability — he is always likely to pick up a booking and is a mistake waiting to happen			0
and who did he concede four against on his debut for @entity111 last season ? @entity0			2
they could do with a repeat performance from the centre half			0
@entity0 may look to target @entity1 centre half @entity105 during the match in @entity118 @entity119 will turn up ? the problem with @entity121 is he is so hit and miss. yes , he ’s an improved player since he left @entity124 , where we did n’t see the best of him , but if he lashes one in the top corner one week , the next it will end up in @entity128 but that ’s why he ’s so dangerous			2
city have to be aware of him because if he is switched on , he has the potential to cause them big problems			2
former @entity124 forward @entity121 will be out to knock @entity0 out of the @entity6			2

@entity0 will be without the injured @entity49 for *crucial* tie
@entity27 will lead his side out against @entity0 at @entity2
city have to better @entity10 's result if they are to *progress*
