by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 11 november 2013 gun violence in popular movies has tripled since the 1980s , according to a new study , which suggests films that were once rated @entity5 at the time of their release would be rated @entity9 today			1
films released today , such as @entity11 and @entity12 , contain more violence than the r - rated films of the 1980s , according to the report published monday in the journal , @entity17			2
overall , violence in movies has nearly quadrupled since the 1950s			2
box office hit : @entity11 , starring @entity21 , is one of the movies released today that ' contains more violence ' than r rated films from the 80s psychologists say it ’s a worrisome trend that we should take seriously , because there is evidence that watching violence on screen increases aggression in real life , according to @entity36			1
‘ of course it ’s not the only factor , and it may not even be the most important factor , but it is n’t a trivial factor — and it ’s one we can change , ’ says @entity37 , an @entity38 psychologist and lead author of the new report			0
the study was done on 945 of the top - grossing films released from 1950 to 2012			1
researchers found that since 2009 , @entity9 movies have featured as much or more violence than the r - rated films released those same years			1
researchers : @entity37 , left , and @entity56 , right , say the worrisome find in their study , published in the journal , @entity17 , is something that can be changed			0
they say gun violence in films affects people 's behaviour and in 2012 , there was more gun violence in @entity9 films than in the r - rated ones out that year			1
the study looks at the @entity73 sequels , such as the 1990 ’s @entity74 , which was rated @entity9 but the 2007 @entity75 , which had more gun violence and a comparable amount of overall violence , was rated @entity9			1
a similar find was discovered with the @entity81 terminator movies , which shows @entity82 : @entity83 had an r rating in 2003 , but it had less gun violence than 2009 ’s @entity86 , which received a @entity9 rating			2
once hardcore : @entity74 , starring @entity73 , was rated @entity5 when it was released in 1990 not so hardcore ? the third installment of the @entity89 , the 2007 @entity75 , also starring @entity73 , was rated @entity9 , even though it contains more gun violence then the sequel ' i am the @entity93 ' : terminator 3 , starring @entity81 , was rated r when it was released in 2003			1
it had less gun violence than the next film in the series , 2009 's @entity86 , which got a @entity9 rating the study ’s co-author , @entity56 , director of the @entity102 at the @entity104 's @entity103 , said the famously violent 1987 film @entity106 has gun violence ‘ comparable to a lot of the movies we ’re calling @entity9 in the last five years ’			2
‘ i would n’t be surprised if @entity106 today would get a @entity9 , ’ he tells @entity36			0
@entity56 thinks the same would apply to the @entity112 comedy @entity113 , which was rated r in 1984 , but feels more like today ’s @entity9 movies in terms of violence			2
movie ratings are determined by the @entity118			0
' famously violent ' : @entity119 and @entity120 , in the @entity5 rated 1987 film , @entity106 , which researchers say would receive a @entity9 rating if released today child 's play : @entity112 in the comedy @entity113 , which was rated @entity5 in 1984 , but feels more like today 's @entity9 movies in terms of violence sex worse than violence ? @entity129 in bed with @entity131 in a scene from the 2012 movie @entity134 , which was rated r because of a sex scene the researchers also examined the content of graphic sexual scenes in the movies and found that sex was much more likely to earn a film an r - rating than violence would , such as the comedy film @entity134 , starring @entity129			1
‘ ( @entity145 ) consistently gets an r rating if it ’s at all explicit , but that ’s not the case with violence , ’ @entity56 says			0
some studies have found that the mere sight of a gun made people act with more hostility , according to @entity36 , and children are the most vulnerable			0
‘ people tell me all the time , i watch violent media and i ’ve never killed anyone			0
so you ’ve never murdered anyone			0
what i want to know is — how do you treat other people ? ’ says @entity37 .			0
