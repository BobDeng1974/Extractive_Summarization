@entity0 is considering allowing electrolyte drinks ' to carry health claims related to their respective purposes ' a bottle of sports drink has nine teaspoons of sugar and should be on the shelves next to soft drinks such as @entity9 and lemonade rather than being allowed to carry claims of health benefits on their bottles , a consumer advocacy group has warned			1
consumer group choice claims most people receive no health benefits from drinking sports drinks , which contained a similar amount of sugar to a can of coke			1
choice has also revealed that a @entity23 bottle of @entity24 has 36 grams of sugar - or nine teaspoons - while a standard 375ml can of @entity9 has 40 grams , or one extra teaspoon			0
the group said the drinks should be in soft drink isles of supermarkets rather then next to health foods			2
the comments follows a submission by the @entity0 asking for electrolyte drinks ' to carry health claims related to their respective purposes '			1
drinks are currently required to have a certain level of energy , sugar and sodium before they can say that they ' improve hydration '			1
' rules about health claims were introduced last year to stop situations where you had clearly unhealthy products like sweets and chocolates making claims that they were 99 per cent fat free , ' a spokesperson for choice , @entity55 , said			1
' there 's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a " halo effect " and people believe the product is healthier overall			0
' consumer group @entity54 , has opposed the proposal claiming it would mislead consumers ' sports drinks can help elite athlete but they are n't designed for everyday use , ' mr @entity55 said ' yet drinks like @entity24 and @entity71 are marketed and sold to everyone			1
' most people will receive no health benefit from a bright blue sugar drink			0
sports drinks belong on the shelves next to @entity9 and @entity78 , not in the health food aisle and the claims on the label need to reflect this			0
' the advocacy group claims that the drinks are already well overused by consumers who drink the product when playing sport , when they are simply spending time outdoors or as hangover cures			2
' there 's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a " halo effect " and people believe the product is healthier overall , ' choice spokesperson , @entity55 , said however , @entity98 from the @entity99 said the labelling would allow product supplier to share research about the benefits of hydrating through sports drinks with consumers , rather than misleading them			2
' what manufacturers wanted to do was to tap into a whole lot of internationally recognised research and scientific studies which are out there , which start to flesh out some of the more detailed , functional benefits that electrolytes and sports drinks can actually make , ' he told the @entity99			0
' so some of their claims might be ... that sports drinks hydrate better than water for intensive exercise , for example , or [ that ] sports drinks hydrate twice as fast as water for intensive exercise			0

@entity0 issued a proposal for electrolyte drinks ' to carry health claims related to their respective purposes '
consumer group choice has opposed the proposal claiming it would mislead consumers
currently , products are required to meet a *strict* set of criteria *including* a certain level of sugar before they can claim they ' improve hydration '
