by @entity0 published : 18:34 est , 5 september 2012 updated : 08:00 est , 6 september 2012 no mission is too much for former @entity3 spy turned strongman leader @entity4 as he sets off on his latest bid to put right the wrongs of nature by teaching birds to fly			1
hang - gliding over @entity12 this week , the all - @entity10 action man guided white cranes which seem to have lost the instinct to migrate south to a warmer climate for the winter			1
the aim was to set the endangered birds on course for @entity20 and as with his previous action - man ventures - which included sedating a tiger , tagging a white whale , and offering tender loving care and a tracking collar to a polar bear - the @entity27 announced total success			1
it is hoped the cranes will now fly from @entity49 ornithological research station to @entity50 , further south in @entity12 , before taking off for @entity20 and a warm winter			1
' for cranes , the parent is a man in a white robe , ' explained @entity55 , the director of the game reserve			2
' they do n't remember a particular person			0
they remember the white robe and hood , or on the ultralight , a white helmet - and a special beak that is worn on the head			2
' @entity68 suit mr president : @entity4 kitted up for the flight in a baggy white outfit , gloves and goggles - but sadly no beak watch the birdie : @entity4 keeps a careful eye on one of the cranes while waiting in a motorized hang - glider pictures do not show @entity4 wearing the beak , probably to avoid yet more vilification from his foes , on the three motorised hang gliding flights he made on the remote on the @entity85 in the @entity12			1
' it is amazing how the birds get used to it , ' @entity4 told state television still dressed in his pilot 's outfit of helmet and goggles			2
' they do not fear the hang - glider and they overtook it			1
it 's a very good feeling			0
' he has been preparing for 18 months , he said , and ahead of the crane - flight he clocked up 17 hours flying the hang glider			2
instant fame : the three - month - old @entity33 cranes got their moment of tv glory preparing for take - off : @entity4 ( front ) sits in the motorized glider at the @entity111 ornithological station , near the city of @entity113 nervous flyer ? @entity4 made three trips in the glider , the first to get familiar with its workings , and two others with the birds as the cranes - hopefully - head south on their own , jokes were flying round the @entity10 web today as one former @entity4 spin doctor branded this a stunt too far			1
' bad publicity , ' said @entity129			0
one cartoon showed @entity4 wearing cardboard wings telling the resentful looking cranes : ' let 's assign roles right now			2
i 'll be the alpha crane ! '			0
another had @entity4 telling the cranes : ' i will save you '			2
one crane responded : ' maybe i 'd better die out			0
' back on terra firma : @entity4 ( 2nd l ) talks with an ornithologist after the successful flights the many faces of @entity4 : the @entity10 president is keen to cultivate a hard - man image , but also to present himself as a simple nature - lover a mock - up picture showed a bare - chested @entity4 in sun glasses flying on a crane			1
the 59 year old president as ' @entity153 ' and opposition leader @entity154 sneered : " about @entity156 they said ' in the night , a light will burn in the window			0
' and of @entity4 they will say : ' he flew over our homes with a flock of cranes			2
' one @entity165 post said : ' for the flock to recognise him as a leader , he stuffed three feathers in his rear			0
' among his other memorable macho stunts was a scuba dive for fragments of ancient @entity174 amphorae			0
later his spokesman @entity175 admitted the artifacts had been planted on the sea floor for @entity4 to grab			0
animal welfare : mr @entity4 has already examined a tranquilised polar bear in the wild ( left ) and has now turned his attention to the plight of the @entity33 white crane ( right ) action man : mr @entity4 's other high - profile stunts have included posing bare chested with a rifle some opponents say humour is the wrong reaction , claiming his stunts are part of the establishment of a cult of personality lionizing an authoritarian leader			1
one victim of the crane flight was @entity198 , author of a book critical of @entity4			0
she appeared to have been fired from her post as editor of travel and science magazine @entity203 ( @entity204 ) after refusing to send a reporter 2,200 miles northwest of @entity206 to cover the event			0
the magazine said she left by agreement following " differences " with the publishers			0
like the cranes , @entity4 also went on to engage with @entity20			1
his adventure came en route to host the @entity215 in @entity216 , attended by @entity217 secretary of state @entity218 and leaders of 21 countries			0
over-exposed ? mr @entity4 has also been photographed posing bare chested with a horse in the past opposition : not all @entity10 have appreciated mr @entity4 's stunts , such as horseback riding ( left )			1
journalist @entity198 ( right ) , author of a book critical of the president , claims she was fired for refusing to send a reporter to cover the @entity33 white cranes event .			1

@entity4 pulls *audacious* stunt to help @entity33 white cranes to @entity20 using hang - glider
cranes born in *captivity* did not know how to fly south , so *environmentalists* *devised* an imitation lead bird to guide the way
it follows other escapades by mr @entity4 , including posing bare - chested with rifles and *petting* a polar bear in the wild
but the latest event has *ruffled* some feathers in @entity10 , with one journalist claiming she was fired for not covering it
