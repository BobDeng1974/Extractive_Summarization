@entity1 is abandoning its bid to buy @entity3 for $ 45.2billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today			1
the move comes after @entity7 decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity16 , followed by the @entity17 , reported thursday afternoon that @entity1 is planning to ' walk away ' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government			1
an announcement from the telecoms giant , already the biggest cable company in the country , could come as early as tomorrow			2
@entity1 and @entity3 declined to comment on thursday			1
the new company would have spun off or sold 3.9million customers the proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid tv market with more than 27million customers across the nation			1
on wednesday night , the @entity43 revealed that @entity7 regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size tv and internet provider was in the public interest			1
staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars			1
the hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline , at the very least			0
@entity29 professor and net neutrality activist @entity28 tweeted : ' @entity1 merger is dead			2
' @entity61 's @entity60 reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the @entity7 decision			2
combining the no. 1 and no. 2 @entity67 cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of tv and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof			2
that would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what @entity67 watch and download			0
that has had competitors , consumer groups , and senators lining up to oppose the deal			0
@entity3 's shares dipped slightly in trading on thursday - though @entity1 stocks were actually up after the news ' this is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal i can remember , ' said @entity90			1
one concern , for example , is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online - only video providers for connecting to its network			0
@entity99 , the satellite tv company behind the new web video service @entity101 , and @entity103 are opposed to the deal			2
another charge is that @entity1 has n't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought @entity107			0
the company says it has , except for one circumstance when the @entity7 found it was n't promoting a stand - alone internet service			1
@entity1 says it fixed that			0
pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks			0
@entity116 , @entity117 , along with five other @entity119 senators and @entity120 , i - @entity115 , this week urged the @entity7 and the @entity121 to block the merger , saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices			1
recent media reports suggested that regulators are n't going to approve it			0
on friday , @entity16 , citing unidentified people , said @entity121 staff attorneys were leaning against the deal			0
the @entity43 on wednesday said , also citing unidentified people , said that @entity7 staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge , although no final decision had been made			1
the @entity7 would send the deal to a judge if it did n't believe it serves the public interest			1
the company has the right to present its case to the judge			0
but a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the @entity7			0
' it 's a dead end for @entity1 , ' said @entity145 , a former @entity7 commissioner			1
the @entity121 declined to comment			0
the @entity7 declined to comment and spokesman @entity146 said the review is ongoing			2
@entity1 spokeswoman @entity148 confirmed that company executives met wednesday with @entity121 and @entity7 officials			1
but she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators			0
if the @entity1 - @entity3 deal falls through , a transaction with @entity158 aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart			1
charter 's bid for @entity162 , which it announced in march , could also be killed			0
many analysts expect that @entity158 , which lost out on its bid for @entity3 to @entity1 , to resurrect its effort if @entity1 is rebuffed			1
' other cable deals that do n't involve @entity1 might be allowed to go through , ' @entity145 said			0
there ' seems to be an antipathy towards @entity1 at the @entity7 ' because the agency thinks @entity1 did n't stick to the conditions of the @entity107 merger , he said			1
a combined charter and @entity3 would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million @entity176 customers			0
that 's still smaller than @entity1 alone , which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million @entity176 customers			2
@entity1 wanted @entity3 to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals @entity99 , @entity181 and @entity183 's @entity182 , as well as newer , cheaper online competitors like @entity103			1
the company had also said the deal would help it cut costs , including for programming â€” the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers			2
but @entity1 may have to look overseas for future acquisitions			0
' @entity194 's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company , ' wrote analyst @entity200 in a client email			2
' for all intents and purposes , their m&a ambitions would be on ice in the @entity67 ' read more : @entity207 on @entity208 @entity209 on @entity210			0
