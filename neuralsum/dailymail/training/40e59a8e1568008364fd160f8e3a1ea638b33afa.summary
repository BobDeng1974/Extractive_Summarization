@entity1 heavy metal band @entity0 — responsible for uncompromising songs such as @entity3 and @entity4 — are getting ready for yet another world tour			1
the grizzled old veterans will criss - cross @entity7 in the spring and summer , before playing @entity8 in the autumn			1
and in between these commitments , the band have announced they are releasing a beer called @entity13			1
in collaboration with @entity17 brewery @entity16 , they plan to release @entity18 , named after another of their songs , on may 9			1
the response has been colossal — more than 100 countries have asked to stock trooper , and 300,000 pints are on pre-order			1
the brewery reports that it is at full tilt six days a week in an attempt to keep up with demand , and brewing three batches a day for the first time in its 175 - year history			1
it ’s a triumph for lead singer @entity35 , who is a fan of traditional @entity37 cask beer , as he was the one who helped formulate the recipe for a beer with ‘ citrus notes ’ and 4.7 per cent alcohol			1
heavy metal : @entity35 is @entity0 's lead singer			1
the band has sold 85million albums but then @entity35 is accustomed to success : @entity0 , routinely ignored by music critics , have an enormous global fan base , and have played more than 2,000 gigs since their early @entity51 heyday			1
they ’ve also sold 85 million albums			2
and they have in @entity35 , their front man since 1981 , one of the most extraordinary figures in the rock world			2
for he is a polymath who has turned out to be brilliant at almost anything he turns his hand to , and that now includes making beer			1
on stage he wears tight trousers , ghoulish head - dresses and sleeveless @entity67 t - shirts			2
in normal life , he is @entity70 in leather who has been a foil fencer at the highest level , once ranked seventh in @entity1 , and was invited to join the @entity1 @entity75 team			1
he is an accomplished commercial pilot , and has run an airline			2
he has also written a couple of novels — just for fun			2
today , he runs an aircraft maintenance company in @entity80			1
and he is an investor in a project to create an unmanned @entity84 spy airship for the @entity86 government , at a cost of up to £ 500 million			2
and all the time , of course , he has been the lynch - pin of @entity0 , one of the most influential bands in rock history			1
as he says : ‘ where else can a 54 - year - old still run around in a jockstrap and tights and not get arrested ? ’ the son of an @entity97 mechanic , @entity35 was born in 1958 in @entity98 , and brought up in @entity99			2
at first he was raised by his grandparents — his mother having fallen pregnant at 16			2
but at four , his father felt he was making enough money to support a child , and he moved in with his parents again			2
his father ran a boarding house , and later sold cars			2
as a teenager , he was sent to board at @entity110 public school , near @entity111 , which he hated			2
he says that he was picked on because of his northern accent and working - class roots			2
however the school helped to feed his interests — in planes , submarines and rockets			1
he also became seriously interested in fencing			2
iron brew : the band 's new beer is called @entity123			1
it was made by @entity16 in @entity125 high demand : more than 300,000 pints of @entity18 have already been pre-ordered he recalls that his metalwork teacher happened to be an amateur fencing coach , and he started teaching him — sparking a lifelong passion for the sport			1
however , he was expelled from @entity110 after boiling up some of his own urine and pouring it on to his headmaster ’s plate of mange - touts as a prank			2
he explained in an interview : ‘ i knew it would n’t harm him			2
i ’d done a bit of chemistry			0
’ he considered a career in the @entity97 , but instead started a degree in modern history at @entity147 in @entity148			0
he was a fan of @entity149 and @entity150 and began to sing in a band , @entity152			1
in 1981 he was approached by @entity0 to come on board			1
they were in need of a lead singer			0
@entity157 , the incumbent , had developed a crippling fondness for cocaine			0
@entity157 commented : ‘ it was n’t just that i was snorting a bit of coke ; i was just going for it non-stop 24 hours a day every day			0
the band had commitments piling up and i just could n’t see my way to the end of it			1
’ multi-talented : @entity35 is also a highly ranked foil fencer and was once asked to join the @entity170 @entity35 did n’t really go in for such excesses			1
he said that he drank a lot of vodka , and slept with lots of girls , and smoked a bit of dope , but that was it			0
and while some heavy metal bands make excessive demands for lavish amounts of food and alcohol to be available backstage , on a recent tour , the ‘ rider ’ for @entity0 featured only red wine , a loaf of bread and some tuna , so they could make sandwiches — modest indeed			1
not for them the drug - induced madness of @entity192 and @entity149			0
that ’s not to say there have n’t been @entity196 moments			0
on one tour they enacted an onstage mock - sacrifice of a cage full of supposed vestal virgins			0
but @entity35 claims : ‘ we ’ve always had an acute awareness of our own absurdity			0
’ by his own account , his lowest point came during a tour of @entity208 when he found himself crawling along a hotel corridor in @entity210 , blind drunk and ravenous , desperately searching for leftover food on discarded room - service trays			0
‘ afterwards , i just thought : “ there ’s got to be more than this			0
” that ’s when i took up fencing again and decided to learn how to fly			0
’ the pinnacle of his fencing career came when his local club won the @entity221 in 1989			0
he was ranked seventh in the @entity1 that year			0
as he said : ‘ i think the best way to find out about something is to try to do it to the max. a lot of people take up a hobby or sport and then find an excuse not to carry on with it			0
once i start something , i wo n’t stop until i ’m as good at it as i ’ll ever be			0
’ @entity35 wanted to fly a plane from the age of five and qualified as a commercial pilot in 1998 during a break from @entity0 ( he left in 1993 and went back in 1999 )			1
he has flown around 500 hours a year ever since for a number of commercial airlines			0
he also flies @entity0 on their tours			1
last year he launched @entity240 , a maintenance , repair and overhaul company in a hangar in an old @entity246 base			1
he is well regarded in the business , and was the keynote speaker at @entity250 ’s 50th anniversary symposium			0
he also has a stake in @entity252 , a @entity253 - based company , which last year won a £ 500million contract with the @entity86 defence department to build a ‘ long endurance , multi-intelligence vehicle ’ — an unmanned spy airship			1
planes run out of gas after about 18 hours , but this thing can sit at 20,000ft and look down on the bad guys for three weeks , ’ he explains			1
‘ what we ’ve got here is the rebirth of the @entity1 airship			0
’ today , he lives in @entity268 , @entity148 , with his wife @entity270 , a photographer , and their three children @entity273 , 15 , @entity274 , 13 , and @entity275 , 11			0
he likes to joke that they were all home births and he served ‘ as the wicket keeper ’			0
@entity35 with @entity0 musicians @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 the one recent controversy he has suffered seems to have been at the hands of another unstoppable monster of rock , @entity288			1
when @entity0 played the @entity291 heavy metal festival in @entity292 in 2005 they were pelted with bottle tops , lighters and eggs by @entity149 fans , and there were suspicions that someone also interfered with their sound			1
not long before the concert , @entity35 had made comments about reality television being ‘ a complete disgrace — freak - show television , the lowest of the low			0
’ @entity288 , who had allowed cameras into her home to film her family for fly - on - the - wall documentary @entity310 , later admitted that she had personally cut @entity0 ’s sound several times , and that the egg pelting had been sanctioned by her			1
‘ i did cut the band ’s sound , ’ she said			1
‘ @entity291 is our tour			0
@entity35 does n’t have the manners to realise that when you are invited into someone ’s home , are seated at their dinner table , are eating their food and drinking their wine , you should n’t talk disrespectfully about them			0
‘ @entity35 got what he deserved			0
we had to listen to his b * * * * * * t for five straight weeks			0
he only had to suffer a couple of eggs on the head			0
’ he later said : ‘ one big lesson i ’ve learned is that you cross @entity288 at your peril			0
’ there are some obstacles , it seems , which even this remarkable polymath can not overcome .			0
