by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:44 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 22:01 est , 14 december 2013 lieutenant - governor @entity2 has recommended president 's rule in @entity5 it 's going to be president 's rule for @entity5 , with lieutenant - governor @entity2 in charge			1
top sources in the @entity12 's office have told @entity13 that president @entity14 has been advised that no party is in a position to form the government in the state			2
" a file has been sent to the @entity21 recommending @entity22 , " the source told @entity13			0
the move came very shortly after @entity25 's @entity24 met @entity2 and asked for 10 more days to clear the fog hanging over government formation and set an 18 - point charter of demands for the @entity30 and @entity31 to accept their support			1
but it seems that the academic - turned - administrator is in no mood to waste the electorate 's time and energy any further and wants to set the administrative process rolling , which has been in cold storage since the code of conduct came into force ahead of the @entity5 elections			2
a top official told mail today : " the @entity12 has recommended the president 's rule , but with a difference			1
the city under the recommended president 's rule administered by the @entity54 will go back to pre- 1993 days when there was no @entity56 and it did not have advisors for the then - l - @entity58 " the current @entity12 is of the firm view that @entity5 is a small state which can be managed without such advice , bearing an indirect load on the state exchequer			1
" this really means that the @entity2 will be effectively administering the state till there are fresh polls , which could be with the general elections next year			2
the @entity12 appears to be responding to the need for urgency being expressed in the capital to get a government going , with questions being raised about the intentions of political parties			0
with the results of assembly polls a week old now , the political situation of the capital continues to be uncertain , with neither @entity31 nor @entity25 consenting to form the government			2
silence the @entity31 has been maintaining a constant silence under the guise of a " fractured mandate " and has kept itself aloof of the political churning			0
the @entity25 , meanwhile , has been keeping @entity84 guessing with its own set of demands for both @entity31 and @entity30			2
@entity25 chief @entity24 had quite a lucrative offer - complete unconditional support to form the government in @entity5 from the vanquished @entity30			1
@entity25 leader @entity24 addresses the media after meeting @entity5 's lieutenant - governor in @entity5 even on saturday , after meeting @entity2 , @entity24 has taken a conditional stand to form the government and has put the onus on the @entity30 and @entity31 , asking for 10 more days			1
but nothing concrete is expected , says a top government source , particularly after @entity96 pointed fingers at @entity25 for " shirking the moral responsibility to respect the @entity5 mandate "			2
the @entity25 chief has also written to both @entity101 and @entity102 asking their stand on 18 demands for developmental work in @entity5 that the @entity25 intends to see through , if they want to be part of the government in @entity5			1
many within the @entity30 and @entity31 have rubbished the 18 demands as " delaying tactics "			0
the move is also being seen as an attempt to put the government ball into the hands of the larger parties			0
@entity30 general secretary @entity115 on saturday said the @entity30 will take a few days to reply to the @entity25 's ( @entity25 ) letter setting conditions for forming the government in @entity5			1
" we will examine the letter and will get back to @entity24 in a day or two , " @entity115 said soon after @entity30 president @entity101 forwarded him the letter by @entity24			0
@entity30 leaders @entity123 ( left ) and @entity124 ( right ) at a press conference at @entity126 in @entity5 @entity115 had earlier written to @entity24 about the readiness of the @entity30 to support an @entity25 government from outside			1
however , the @entity30 's @entity129 hit out at the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) over its reluctance on forming the government in @entity5			1
they accused the @entity25 of shirking off responsibility			0
in a direct attack against @entity24 , @entity30 mla @entity124 slammed the party 's 18 - point questionnaire to @entity101 , saying that that by doing so , @entity24 and his party members were ridiculing the democracy			1
" we had expressed before the @entity12 , our willingness to support the @entity25 from outside just to ensure that the public mandate is respected			0
" however , this act by the aap whereby they wrote to the @entity30 , imposing conditions on executive matters , is unreasonable			0
today they have written to the @entity30 , will they write to the @entity144 or @entity146 president @entity145 next ? " @entity124 asked			0
reacting on the issue , another @entity30 mla @entity123 said : " these conditions deal with issues that are a state government 's prerogative			0
so if the @entity25 comes to power , they must bring about these changes			0
why do they then need to impose them upon us ? did they ask us before making these promises ? "			0
@entity5 @entity31 chief @entity158 has accused the @entity25 of playing ' dirty politics ' @entity1 the @entity31 's @entity5 unit , which is upset with the @entity25 's 18 - point agenda , has charged that the latter 's leader @entity24 is playing " dirty politics to hog the media attention "			1
@entity5 @entity31 chief @entity158 said : " the @entity25 is simply trying to be in the limelight and divert the attention of @entity84 with silly acts			2
what does it mean by the 18 - point letter sent to us ? if the @entity25 forms the government , it can regulate and implement whatever the party plans to do in @entity5 "			1
@entity158 alleged that the aap 's 18 - point agenda is a ploy to distract the attention of voters from the fact that the party is shirking its responsibility though it is in a position to form a government			1
" the aap does n't want the people to realise that it will be held responsible for the inconvenience caused to them if @entity5 goes to re-polls , " he said			0
several @entity31 workers wondered why the @entity25 convener had sought 10 days ' time from lieutenant governor @entity2			1
" if the party is firm that it will not form the government , why does it need 10 days ' time to come to a conclusion ? what are @entity25 workers aspiring to achieve ? " a senior @entity5 @entity31 leader asked on condition of anonymity			1
@entity31 leaders also criticised the @entity25 for being fickle - minded			0
" the party had made it clear that it would not take support from anyone			0
then @entity205 made a statement saying if the @entity25 could lend support to the @entity31 in @entity5 if its demands were met			2
" after that @entity24 said under no circumstances the @entity25 would be associated with corrupt parties such as the @entity31 and the @entity30			2
now , he is again back with his dirty games , " @entity158 added .			0

@entity24 asks @entity213 for 10 more days to form government
@entity25 leader puts ball in big parties ' courts with 18 - point charter of demands
@entity2 *impatient* to form president 's rule immediately
@entity5 may have to go to the polls again at general election
