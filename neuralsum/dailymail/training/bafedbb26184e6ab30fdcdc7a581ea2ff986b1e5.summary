by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 02:09 est , 8 january 2014 if you want an example of a club lost in its own deluded world of self - importance , i give you @entity8 , ladies and gentlemen			1
after watching their well - paid internationals get absolutely battered out of sight by @entity14 in the @entity15 at @entity16 on saturday , i took the train back to @entity18			2
@entity20 minions waited in a queue to board the train at @entity23 , while the @entity8 players ambled slowly along the platform to the first - class carriage at the front of the train			1
quite what made them so important that the rest of us had to wait i ’m not sure			0
@entity32 : a young @entity14 fan and young @entity8 supporter before the game at @entity16 @entity36 : @entity8 fans who tried to speak to the players on the train were turned away by security easy street : @entity14 cruised through to the fourth round of the @entity15 with victory over @entity8 on saturday once on board some excited young @entity8 fans aged around nine or 10 ran towards the front of the train , hoping to get autographs from their ‘ heroes ’			1
they were stopped and told that security would not let them through			0
they were then advised that once the train arrived at @entity55 if they were quick they might catch the players then			1
let ’s get this straight : @entity8 fans were still willing to idolise the players who had been embarrassingly dreadful at @entity14 but were denied that chance because those players apparently needed to be left alone			1
players are lost in a world where they think they ’re really important , even when they ’re actually being rubbish at their jobs			2
what kind of human being throws dangerous objects at a man who is lying injured on the ground right in front of them ? and what sort of disgusting individual throws coins at a man on a stretcher ? worse than that , what kind of person throws coins knowing they could hit and injure @entity85 volunteers as they carry that stretcher ? crocked : @entity87 will be out of action for six months after injuring his anterior cruciate ligament cheeky : @entity87 was pelted by coins as he mocked the @entity93 fans when he was taken off injured i ’m shocked the debate centred on @entity87 ’s cheeky , inoffensive reminder of the score			1
surely the question is why have n’t @entity93 and / or their fans been sanctioned for the disgraceful events on saturday evening ? i find it a bit bizarre that @entity103 decided to rule @entity87 out of the @entity104			1
if his operation is done this week there is an outside chance he will be back in time for the @entity104 , judging by recoveries other sportsmen have made from the same injury			2
@entity103 say the operation will happen ‘ in the near future ’ – there is no urgency from the club because they would n’t see any benefit from a speedy operation			1
instead the @entity120 will benefit from a fresh @entity87 who gets a full pre-season			1
the reality is he wo n’t make it to @entity124			0
it ’s a shame because he belongs on that stage			0
@entity127 needs @entity87 ; his pace and quality in front of goal make @entity132 better			1
i ’m gutted he wo n’t be there			0
blow : @entity87 will miss the @entity104 next summer in a setback for @entity132 manager @entity127 ( right ) the massive gap between fans and their clubs was brought sharply into focus this weekend as not just the @entity143 manager , but also the co-chairmen decided to completely disregard the club ’s loyal supporters and its history			1
if i listed the years 1964 , 1975 and 1980 to @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 i wonder what their response would be			0
@entity143 fans would , to a man , instantly know those were the years the @entity143 won the @entity15 at @entity155			1
@entity156 lifting the famous trophy , @entity159 ’s brace , and @entity161 ’s header			0
these are what memories are made of			0
not what happens on saturday at @entity166			0
the @entity143 ’ @entity168 success in 1965 came about only because they won the @entity15			1
so this competition is special to @entity143 fans			1
they do n’t expect to win it every year , and reluctantly accept there will be times they are knocked out by lower league clubs			0
but @entity148 got this one all wrong			0
he ’s made a huge mess of his job and so @entity143 find themselves in the bottom three			2
because of his failure , he then decides to disrespect the @entity15 and the fans by fielding a team that could not win the tie			2
worse still they got thrashed and the confidence and careers of some promising youngsters have been put in a vulnerable position			0
all this time there were plenty of senior players sitting around doing nothing , apparently too soft and pathetic to play three games in six days			2
those players want to play in the @entity15 , they want to play in a semi-final , and they want to play at @entity166 on saturday			2
@entity148 , once a symbol of all that was good about old - school , no - nonsense @entity199 football , has got lost in the modern game , where finishing 17th is seen as something special			0
in short he ’s lost touch with football and fans			0
@entity206 and @entity150 play the ‘ lifelong @entity143 fans ’ card with relentless regularity			1
i appreciate they ’ve got to balance the books , but no @entity143 fan would back what @entity148 did at the weekend , so i find it shocking that the co-chairmen have declared they ’re fully behind the manager			2
fans still want to win the @entity15			0
players want to win it			0
@entity148 , @entity206 and @entity150 did n’t want to win the @entity15 this season			0
that ’s not what @entity143 are about			2
history : @entity143 's @entity225 , @entity156 and @entity226 on a victory lap of after the 1964 final special : @entity143 players parade the @entity15 at @entity230 after beating @entity231 in the 1975 final last time out : @entity143 have not won the @entity15 since they beat @entity103 in the final in 1980 @entity206 and @entity150 should be very worried by the manager ’s relationship with his captain			1
@entity148 and @entity237 go back a long way , and @entity148 persuaded the owners to give @entity237 a massive contract in 2011 when they were in the championship			0
but after his second unnecessary red card in the space of a few weeks , @entity237 had @entity148 perplexed , unable to understand why he had been so ‘ irresponsible			0
’ has @entity148 lost the respect of his captain ? abject : @entity143 were thrashed by @entity246 in the @entity15 third round on sunday losing respect : @entity237 was sent off twice in four games for @entity143 twice in recent weeks my club @entity32 have been denied goals because officials have n’t spotted the ball went over the line – once away to @entity256 on @entity257 , and again at @entity258 in the @entity15 on saturday			1
what made it worse was that opposition players knew the ball had crossed the line – and admitted it afterwards – but pretended it had n’t			1
what do i expect ? how about some honesty ? what would be wrong with @entity256 and @entity258 players actually saying : ‘ fair enough , our opponents have been good enough to score a goal against us , so that goal should stand ’ ? naive you think ? never going to happen , you reckon ? denied : @entity32 have twice seen goals ruled out after officials did not spot the ball crossed the line you ’re probably right			1
but if you ’re saying it ’s ok for players to blatantly lie about an honest goal being scored , then you ’ve got no right to moan about players diving			2
do n’t give mixed messages to players – you either want them to play fair and honest , or you do n’t			0

young @entity8 fans were not allowed to meet the players on the train
@entity103 are in no rush to send @entity87 for his operation
@entity143 disregarded the fans ' loyalty and the club 's history at @entity246
teams not admitting the ball has crossed the line is as *bad* as diving
