by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it might be one of the biggest games in the club 's history , but @entity8 's players looked in relaxed mood ahead of their flight from @entity12 airport to @entity13 for saturday 's @entity15 final			1
manager @entity16 and his players flew south on friday afternoon , just over 24 hours before they take on @entity18 at @entity19			1
@entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 were among the @entity25 stars spotted in the departure lounge , while @entity16 enjoyed a chat with son @entity28 before take - off			1
onward bound ! @entity8 's players at @entity31 en route to @entity13 ahead of saturday 's clash what 's up ? goalkeeper @entity36 appeared to be having some trouble with the sunshine on @entity12 belief : @entity8 boss @entity16 has called on his players to cause an upset against @entity18 in the @entity15 final it 's 20 years to the week since @entity16 lifted the @entity15 as captain of @entity45 and memories of that illustrious day still burn as intensely as ever for 53 - year - old			1
@entity16 said : ' we must be rank outsiders , but that 's the beauty of the @entity15			1
@entity50 were huge favourites last year but @entity51 came up and won the thing and that 's why , for me , it 's the greatest competition			0
' for a club like ours to take on the mighty @entity18 has a fantastic ring to it			2
the club has never been there in its history , so it 's a wonderful achievement			0
but you 've got to try to grasp the occasion and enjoy it , because if you 're not careful it just goes past you			0
' @entity16 made his cup final debut in 1990 as @entity45 edged past @entity66 after a replay , and returned as captain four years later to marshal @entity45 to a stunning 4 - 0 final win over @entity71 's @entity70			1
after also captaining @entity45 in a 1 - 0 final defeat to @entity73 in 1995 , @entity16 was left out of the side for the 1996 win over @entity76 due to injury			1
@entity16 recalled : ' my first one was in 1990 and it was the showpiece , the pinnacle of the season			2
there was a clamour of it and i 'm reminded of the intensity and of the attention			0
all smiles : ex-man @entity45 defender @entity16 is looking to add more silverware to his illustrious career in the game i know it 's over : @entity93 has resigned himself to leaving the club and this will be his last matchday happy memories : @entity16 ( left ) lifts the 1994 @entity15 at @entity19 as captain of @entity45 @entity100 words : @entity16 speaks to his @entity8 players during training on tuesday sense of occasion : @entity16 will lead the @entity25 into their first ever @entity15 final with @entity22 ( right ) up front ' it was over in a blur			1
not many of them are married but i told the players it 's a bit like your wedding day - before you know it you 're married , and before you know it the @entity15 final 's gone			1
' the memories of the @entity15 are the ones you cherish when you 've finished your playing career			0
' the ones you really remember are your @entity15 days and , believe me , it 's far better when you 've won one than when you 've lost one			2
' on the face of it , the @entity25 are hardly in the best of shapes going into their first final , having rounded off their @entity134 campaign with a run of five successive games without a win			0
in addition , they are shorn of cup - tied frontmen @entity140 and @entity141 , and have doubts over a number of players including another striker in @entity146 and defender @entity147			1
but there is better news for @entity16 with goalkeeper @entity150 staging a successful comeback from kidney damage which was initially expected to keep him out for the rest of the season , and @entity155 also pushing for a surprise recall after his groin operation			0
preparation : @entity8 keepers @entity150 ( right ) and @entity36 ( left ) get ready for @entity19 for @entity16 , the poor end - of - season run which followed the tumultuous 5 - 3 semi-final win over @entity162 was more than mere coincidence			1
' we try but we ca n't keep it normal - you can tell that , ' @entity16 added			2
' you ca n't put a lid on it			0
they 're playing in arguably the biggest game of their career and that 's what you play football for			2
all they 've thought about for four weeks is the @entity15 final			0
' when you play for your youth team or your district team you want to do one thing - play in the @entity15 final			2
there 's a spring in their step and so there should be			0
' everybody enjoys a shock and , if you 're not an @entity18 fan , i 'm sure the rest of the world will be rooting for @entity8			1
' the reality is it 's a one - off , and it 's a place where heroes are made			0
who can be that hero and go and win us the @entity15 ? '			0

@entity16 earned three @entity15 winners ' *medals* with @entity45
the @entity8 manager believes his side are outsiders to beat @entity18 at @entity19
@entity140 and @entity141 will miss saturday 's game because they 're cup - tied
