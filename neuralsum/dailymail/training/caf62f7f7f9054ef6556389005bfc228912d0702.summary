by @entity0 the parents of a sport - mad 11 - year - old today told of their anger after school nurses branded him fat			1
@entity6 , who is 4ft 5ins and 6st , exercises every day taking part in tennis , gymnastics and netball classes			1
but after a check - up with the school nurses , his father @entity12 and step - mother @entity13 were sent a letter telling them @entity6 is considered ' overweight ' and is likely to become an overweight adult			1
the youngster , who rides his scooter to school everyday and regularly roller blades , said he has been left upset by the label , which his parents have branded ' outrageous '			0
@entity25 , right , is furious after receiving a letter from school nurses telling him his 11 - year - old son @entity6 , left , is ' overweight ' experts today told @entity30 the @entity32 measure is a ' waste of time ' unless at least three measurements are taken over a set period of time			1
@entity37 , chair of the @entity38 said any @entity32 measurement must be taken in conjunction with an assessment with a healthcare worker , who can make an informed judgement taking into account a child 's lifestyle			1
' if the boy is sporty that immediately tells you he will have more muscle , which weighs one and a half times as much as fat - and @entity32 takes no account of that			1
' mr @entity6 , 41 , said : ' to class @entity6 as overweight is a disgrace - it ’s outrageous			1
' he is an active 11 - year - old and , due to his gymnastics and other sports he plays , he has a good physique and is quite muscly			0
he is clearly not overweight			0
' the health and safety officer from @entity62 , near @entity63 , added : ' he was a bit bothered by the letter but we reassured him that he was fine and not overweight at all and that the tests did n’t take into account his muscle			2
' @entity6 is sensible enough to accept that there is nothing wrong with how he is			2
but i am angry that my son has been pigeon - holed in this way			0
' @entity6 exercises every day , tkaing part in tennis , gymnastics and netball classes			1
but when measured by nurses at his school , his @entity32 - calculated from his height and weight - declared he was ' overweight ' and in the 93rd percentile for someone of his age @entity37 , chair of the @entity38 , said , told @entity30 : ' the thing to remember first off is that @entity32 is a waste of time in that all it will do is tell you how tall , how short , how thin or fat a child is on that given day			1
' if you are to make any kind of judgement about what is appropriate or not for that individual child , you either have to measure them again in three to six months or use clinical judgement to determine whether the boy is normal or overweight			2
' if the boy is sporty , that immediately tells you he will have more muscle which weighs one and a half times as much as fat , and @entity32 takes no account of that			1
' when making a judgement on any individual you have to actually see the person holistically and know a bit about them , whether they are sporty or not , or tall for their age			0
' it is really important a clinical judgement is made by somebody who knows what they are doing , a healthcare professional			1
' measurements taken at school are sent to parents at home without clinical assessment			2
' a computer inputs the measurements and @entity32 into a pre-formed letter and that can annoy parents who know exactly how the child lives , exercises , eats and their standard of living			1
' it is the interaction between the health professional and parents which will achieve a sensible outcome			0
' @entity32 is a useful measure but only when taken sequentially , so a curve can predict the child 's growth , and whether it is normal or veering towards overweight or underweight			1
and for that you need two , ideally three measurements			0
' @entity6 was weighed and measured by nurses from the @entity151 who visited his school , @entity152 in @entity62 , near @entity63 , two weeks ago			2
he was measured at 137cm , 39.15kg , putting him in the 93rd percentile for this age			1
in the letter , the school nursing team said : ' the results suggest that your child is overweight for their age , sex and height			1
' if your child is overweight now , they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult			2
' this can lead to health problems			0
you and your child can make simple changes to be more active and eat more healthily			0
' @entity6 , from @entity62 , said he was upset by the letter and added : ' my mum and dad told me not to believe what it said			2
i ’m pretty happy with the way i look			0
' both mr @entity6 and ms @entity13 , 43 , are now calling for changes to how the letters are written			2
ms @entity13 said : ' the letter is written in a blunt way and is quite patronising			0
' what concerns us is if this letter was seen by a child who was more impressionable and already had issues with self - esteem and how they looked			2
' to be labelled as overweight like this could have a really negative effect on them and lead to problems with eating disorders in the future			0
' what happens in your childhood can affect you for the rest of your life			0
children these days are under enough pressure without being labelled like this			0
' the @entity151 - who has sent out letters to thousands of parents across the district - has apologised for any upset the letter may have caused			0
@entity209 , assistant lead for school nursing at @entity151 , said : ' the letter was sent as part of the @entity214 programme in which all children in reception year and year six have their height and weight checked , unless their parents opt - out			1
mr @entity6 said : ' to class @entity6 as overweight is a disgrace - it 's outrageous ' ' the heights and weights taken are used to calculate a @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
' the @entity32 thresholds have four categories , underweight , healthy weight , overweight or very overweight and this falls in line with guidance from the @entity230 ( @entity230 )			1
' across the country every health provider is asked to provide feedback to parents to try and encourage families to engage with the @entity236			0
' they can provide help and support if needed and actively ask parents to get in touch with any concerns			0
' this letter was not meant to cause distress or upset and we apologise if this has been the case			0
' @entity246 will be contacting mr @entity6 direct to discuss this issue further			0

@entity6 , who exercises every day , is 4ft 5ins and weighs 6st
but his @entity32 - calculated from height and weight measurements - brands him in the ' overweight ' category - the 93rd percentile for his age group
nurses sent a letter home to father @entity25 to inform him
he said : ' to class @entity6 as overweight is a disgrace - it 's outrageous '
experts say taken on its own @entity32 is a ' waste of time ' , adding an assessment by healthcare professional has to take into account the child 's lifestyle
