the @entity1 is to visit @entity2 for the very first time early next year , @entity0 has confirmed			2
@entity4 will travel to the country at the end of february and return to the @entity7 in early march , but will be without the @entity8 , who will be almost eight months pregnant			1
the @entity1 will spend three days in @entity9 and carry out a series of engagements in @entity12 before travelling to @entity2 for a three - day visit - much of which will be spent in @entity14			1
that visit was n't entirely without hiccups , with prince @entity21 overheard describing @entity14 as ' ghastly ' and later making his infamous ' slitty eye ' quip to a @entity7 student living there			1
prince @entity28 , who is a supporter of the @entity29 , has never been to mainland @entity2 but did travel to @entity30 for the handover ceremony in 1997			1
@entity4 ’s trip will put the spotlight on his father ’s uneasy relationship with @entity2 and also raise questions about why @entity28 has yet to make an official visit to the republic			1
a high profile tour by the @entity1 will be viewed as an attempt to improve diplomatic relations with the country and comes after the red carpet was rolled out for @entity2 prime minister @entity44 when he visited @entity45 in june			2
despite not being head of state , the @entity2 politician reportedly demanded a private audience with the queen and even threatened to cancel the trip if it did n't happen			0
unlike the @entity20 , who did eventually meet with mr @entity44 , @entity28 ’s dealings with @entity2 have been troubled in the past , particularly after he described @entity2 ’s leaders as ' appalling old waxworks ' in a leaked diary			2
in 1999 , he was accused of boycotting a @entity2 state visit to the @entity7 by failing to attend a banquet held for the then - president @entity57			2
during a visit from mr @entity57 's successor , @entity59 in 2005 , @entity28 carefully side - stepped the issue by being out of the country on a tour of the @entity63 on the night of the official dinner			0
he did not meet mr @entity59 on the remaining two days of his visit			0
four years later , @entity28 did meet mr @entity59 but during a meeting held at the @entity67 in @entity68 rather than at his @entity45 home , @entity70			0
flying solo : prince @entity4 is no stranger to travelling alone and visited @entity71 without his wife in september boost : the @entity73 hope the visit will improve relations between @entity45 and @entity14 boycott : prince @entity28 , seen here at the 1997 @entity30 handover , is yet to travel to @entity2 unimpressed : @entity28 , seen here in @entity30 in 1992 , is unimpressed by @entity2 's treatment of @entity80 during the meeting , he raised the subject of @entity80 , whose exiled leader , the @entity29 , @entity28 is known to admire			1
2009 also saw @entity28 sanction the opening of @entity86 ( @entity2 ) in @entity14 - a move seen as a step towards a friendlier relationship with the country			1
the @entity91 also worked with @entity2 planning authorities and a university on a restoration project			0
although the @entity20 remains diplomatic in her dealings with @entity2 visitors , the @entity21 , much like his son , has been freer with his opinions			0
welcome : the @entity20 and prince @entity21 welcomed former @entity2 president @entity59 to @entity45 in 2005 ghastly ! prince @entity21 's verdict on @entity14 , overheard during a 1986 state visit to @entity2 with the @entity20 during a 1986 tour of @entity2 , @entity21 was overheard describing @entity14 as ' ghastly ' and told @entity7 exchange students : ' if you stay here much longer you ’ll all be slitty - eyed			1
' the same year , he told a @entity107 meeting : ' if it has four legs and it ’s not a chair , if it ’s got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane and if it swims and it ’s not a submarine , the @entity110 will eat it			0
' most recently , in 2010 , on hearing that president @entity114 had had dinner with the presidents of @entity117 and @entity2 , he quipped : ' how can you tell the difference between them ? '			0
