when farmer @entity1 delivered this deformed calf , he knew the story would have legs in the @entity6 media ... and indeed it ran and ran			1
that 's because the baby cow in question was born not with four limbs , but with six			2
as well its usual hind and forequarters a cow should have , the animal managed to sprout an extra two from its neck while in its mother 's womb			2
@entity1 , from @entity18 , @entity6 , said : ' i 've raised the mother for five years and seen her through four births and i 've never seen anything like this before			1
' leggy : the youngster emerged on a farm in @entity18 with four normal legs and two more growing from its neck			1
he added : ' the extra legs do n't seem to bother or hurt her but she ca n't move them or use them			1
' everyone seems to want to see her though since a friend put some pictures of her on the internet			0
' i get crowds of people here every day and all kinds of camera crews from tv stations			0
' vets have ruled out claims that the legs came from a genetic mutation caused by pollution			2
twins become one : vets say the extra legs are probably the remains of a twin calf which was nearly completely absorbed during the pregnancy instead , they say they are probably the remains of a twin calf which was nearly completely absorbed during the pregnancy			1
expert @entity57 said : ' it happens when there is n't quite full separation of the twins and the smaller , weaker one is consumed			0
' as long as the legs are not attached to any major nerves or blood vessels , we would be able to remove them without damaging the calf			0
that used to happen so the animal could be sold			0
but i have already been offered far more than the market value by animal parks - and i am considering the offers			0

the calf was born with two extra legs sprouting from its neck , making six
it was born at farm *belonging* to farmer @entity1 in @entity18 , @entity6
he says the calf can not use extra limbs but does n't seem bothered by them
vets say its not down to pollution but absorbed its own twin inside womb
