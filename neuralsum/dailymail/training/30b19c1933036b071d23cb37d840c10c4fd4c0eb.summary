over a thousand exoplanets have so far been found , and the discoveries are coming thick and fast			0
but the recent find of three super-hot worlds in a stellar city 2,500 light years away has got astronomers particularly excited			0
one of the new exoplanets is orbiting a star that is a rare solar twin - a star that is almost identical to our sun in all respects			1
astronomers have used @entity17 's @entity16 planet hunter in @entity18 , along with other telescopes around the world , to discover three planets orbiting stars in the cluster @entity24			1
pictured here is an artist 's impression of what one of the planet 's with a sun like our own might look like this is the first solar twin in a cluster that has been found to have a planet , and scientists claim there could be many more			1
astronomers know that most stars form out of giant gas clouds in clusters			0
but up until now , they have n’t found many planets orbiting stars in clusters			1
the planet is thought to be about one - third the mass of @entity47 and orbits the star once every 6.9 days			1
its surface is likely to be hotter than a blast furnace			0
the planet , and two others , orbit stars in the open cluster @entity24 , which scientists believe is four billion years old – around the same age as the @entity58 and the sun. this chart shows the location of the star cluster @entity24 in the constellation of @entity64 ( @entity65 )			1
this map shows most of the stars that are visible to the unaided eye under good conditions , and the location of the cluster is highlighted with a red circle on the image			0
this object can be spotted with binoculars and many of its component stars seen with a moderate - sized telescope @entity81 67 ( also known as @entity24 or @entity24 ) is an open stellar cluster in the constellation of @entity64			1
age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years			0
only few known open clusters were found to be older , among them probably @entity88 at about 5 billion years			2
@entity24 is the nearest old open cluster , and has become a standard example for studying stellar evolution			0
the cluster has more than 100 stars similar to the sun , and countless red giants			2
the total star count has been estimated at well over 500			0
the recent finding revealed the first solar twin in a cluster that has been found to have a planet			1
only a handful of planets have been found orbiting stars so similar to the sun - such as @entity105 and @entity106 - but none in a cluster			1
the finding shows that stars just like the sun can form planets and that they can do so even when in a stellar cluster , where it ’s relatively crowded			1
@entity114 from the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and lead author of the new study , said her team wanted to find out more			0
‘ in the @entity24 star cluster the stars are all about the same age and composition as the sun. ‘ this makes it a perfect laboratory to study how many planets form in such a crowded environment , and whether they form mostly around more massive or less massive stars			2
’ the team used the @entity16 planet - finding instrument on @entity17 's 3.6 - metre telescope at the @entity136			2
they carefully monitored 88 selected stars in @entity24 over a period of six years to look for the tiny tell - tale motions of the stars towards and away from @entity58 that reveal the presence of orbiting planets			1
many of the cluster stars are fainter than those normally targeted for exoplanet searches and trying to detect the weak signal from possible planets pushed harps to the limit			2
‘ these new results show that planets in open star clusters are about as common as they are around isolated stars - but they are not easy to detect , ’ said @entity151 , from the @entity17			1
‘ the new results are in contrast to earlier work that failed to find cluster planets , but agrees with some other more recent observations , ’ he added			0
‘ we are continuing to observe this cluster to find how stars with and without planets differ in mass and chemical makeup			2
’ @entity81 67 ( also known as @entity24 or @entity24 ) is an open stellar cluster in the constellation of @entity64			0
age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years			0

one of the planets orbits a star similar to our sun once every 6.9 days
this is the first solar twin in a cluster that has been found to have a planet
scientists now believe that planets in open star clusters are as common as they are around isolated stars - but they are not easy to detect
this may have *implications* for finding an @entity58 *2.0* with a sun like our own
