by @entity0 @entity1 : 23:37 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:28 est , 27 december 2013 tiny diamonds thought to be 4.3billion years old were actually remnants of polishing grit , left when zircon crystals were being prepared for laboratory testing , scientists have found			1
the gemstones , found in cracks inside the crystals , were believed to have been the oldest known diamonds found in terrestrial rocks when they were first reported on in journal nature in 2007			1
however , it has now emerged that the miniscule stones were in fact a paste which had been rubbed into tiny cracks in the zircons , found in @entity22 , western @entity23 , when they were cleaned for tests			1
tiny diamonds thought to be 4.3billion years old were actually synthetic diamond polishing grit , scientists have found			2
this image shows the difference between synthetic diamonds and natural diamonds , and a close - up of polishing debris found in ancient zircons from the @entity22 in @entity23 scientists at the @entity37 , realised the error when they used a powerful emission electron microscope to photograph the ' diamonds ' , according to a study published in the february edition of the journal @entity44 and @entity45			1
they noticed that instead of the rough - edges associated with real diamonds , these were in fact sharp - edged synthetic diamonds found in polishing paste			2
authors of the 2007 study , who provided their samples for testing , have agreed with the findings by lead author @entity57 and @entity37 research geophysicist @entity58 , according to @entity59			0
zircon crystals as old as 4.4billion years were discovered inside 3billion old sedimentary rocks at @entity22 in the 1980s , which showed evidence of @entity44 's early continents as the older zircons must have washed into the rock			1
in 2007 the international team , headed by geochemist @entity68 from @entity70 , reported that diamonds , most of which were only just wider than a human hair and aged between 4.3billion and 3.1billion years , had been found inside the crystals from @entity22			2
the existence of the gemstones was thought to be evidence that a thick continental crust had already formed during the @entity44 's early years , as the surface would have to be cool enough for diamonds to form			1
the presence of the diamonds backed up theories surrounding early continental drift , as plate tectonics , which also cause volcanoes , would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form their presence also backed up theories surrounding early continental drift , as plate tectonics would have created enough pressure for the diamonds to form			0
however , some scientists were suspicious of the findings due to the fact that the zircons had been cleaned using diamond paste , and found it difficult to believe that diamonds with an age range of more than one billion years could have been found within individual zircons			2
after receiving permission to test the zircons , professor @entity57 and her team found that the diamonds were more similar to angular synthetic diamonds , rather than a natural form			0
the crystals were also surrounded by minerals which made up the polishing compound and resin used to clean the zircons			0
co-author of the 2007 study , @entity117 , accepts that polishing paste had found its way into the zircons , but maintains that there could be diamonds embedded in the core of the crystals			1
however , professor @entity58 disagrees			0
' they can go back to their cache of @entity128 zircons and make new specimens , ' he told @entity59			0
' if you 're a betting person , i 'll make you a bet that they wo n't find it			0
there have been an enormous amount of ( @entity22 ) zircons analyzed in a bunch of different ways , and no one has ever found diamonds			0

tiny gemstones were found in cracks inside zircon crystals
diamonds were believed to have been the @entity44 's oldest
new tests reveal they were really cleaning paste used to prepare zircons
