by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:36 est , 19 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:46 est , 19 december 2013 traditionalist : @entity4 has said he wants to see romance , not full - blown sex on the dancefloor @entity4 — feminist champion ? it might sound unlikely , but bless him , @entity9 ’s head judge is coming over all strident on the subject of equality			1
we ’ve been chatting about who could possibly replace sir @entity15 when he finally steps down as main presenter			2
until now @entity4 has always said there was only one man for the job : the ever - graceful @entity18			1
now , though , he ’s throwing another name into the hat — @entity22			1
he ’s awfully impressed by how well she has done , fronting the sunday night results show with @entity24			1
‘ the thing about @entity22 is she is naturally witty , and very much at home in front of the cameras , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m not saying @entity24 is n’t , but actually it ’s refreshing , and they make a good double act			1
i do n’t think it would be the worst thing in the world if they gave her the gig permanently , once @entity15 decides he does n’t want to do it any more			2
i think she ’s marvellous			1
’ would they though ? is n’t there an unwritten law about a primetime tv show having at least one male presenter ? ‘ well , it usually is a man and a woman , is n’t it , but i do n’t see why it has to be			2
it ’s only because that ’s the way it has always been done			1
i ’m all for equality , me			2
’ @entity4 , 69 , is as straight - talking as they come			1
in recent weeks he has been accused of being curmudgeonly : the @entity56 ’s resident @entity55			1
‘ i do n’t actually think i am grumpy , ’ he harrumphs			2
‘ if the contestants on @entity9 do something wrong , should i keep schtum ? not on your nelly ! sometimes i do think it comes out a bit harsh , a bit clumsy , but that ’s the joy of live tv			1
’ anyway , i tell him , we like grumpy on saturday night telly			2
‘ yeah , when you ’ve had a load of sugar , it ’s nice to have a lemon			1
anyway , you ca n’t help how your mother put your hat on			2
you have to be yourself			2
’ @entity4 is relishing the final			1
who ’s been the most surprising contestant this year ? for him , it ’s @entity80 presenter @entity79 — whose early routine he described as ‘ all bums and bongos ’			1
surprise : @entity4 says @entity80 presenter @entity79 has been the most surprising contestant this year ‘ she ’s been the real revelation , has n’t she ? ’ he laughs			1
‘ she sits there on the sofa of a morning , all prim and proper with @entity86 ... then she explodes on the dancefloor			2
i think that ’s brilliant — what @entity9 is all about , letting us see another side of these people			1
’ is n’t he worried the show is getting too saucy , though ? he had a pop at @entity98 ’s @entity97 for a sexy routine			1
‘ it ’s the ballroom , not the bedroom			1
what i want to see is romance — not fullblown sex on the dancefloor			2
a little spice is good			2
but we do n’t want people sat at home going : “ @entity110 , how disgusting			1
” ' you might think @entity4 , a former ballroom champ , gets irritated by less gifted dancers reaching the semi-finals			1
but he says the public vote keeps strictly successful			1
‘ at the end of the day , it ’s the great entertainers we remember			1
tell me this , who won strictly the year @entity120 was in ? you ca n’t remember ? well , me neither			1
( it was @entity123 )			2
‘ i ’ve done 11 series now ( and 18 in the @entity125 )			2
i struggle to remember even people who won the thing			2
’ still , @entity4 loves the show that turned him into a star			1
he was 60 and running a dance school in @entity131 when he was asked to join an updated @entity132			2
he jumped at the chance and has never looked back , and now has a radio show and his own @entity136 special			2
@entity4 ’s @entity137 , a mix of his favourite festive tv clips , will air on @entity140 — ‘ if anyone is still awake , ’ he quips			1
‘ they are all there — @entity144 , the two ronnies — all the classics			0
i ’m like anyone else			0
an old traditionalist , ’ he says			0
does he tune in to the @entity136 special , though ? ‘ i have never watched one episode of @entity150 , or @entity151 or @entity152			0
i do n’t do soaps at all — deliberately			0
i think once you get in , you ’re hooked			0
they are like heroin ! ’ replacement ? @entity4 is impressed with how well @entity22 has done , fronting the sunday night results show with @entity24 this is a problem when he fails to recognise soap stars when they pitch up on @entity9 , ‘ but better that than feel i have to tune in every day , and let them take over my life ! ’ is there anything he hates on telly ? he says he ‘ does n’t mind ’ modern panel shows , but ca n’t be doing with swearing			1
‘ it ’s the trendy thing , is n’t it , swearing for swearing ’s sake — just because they think it is funny			1
it does get my goat			0
’ so is he a @entity136 person , or a @entity55 ? ‘ no , i love @entity136 , and i get really annoyed at these bah - humbug types who moan about it			0
right moves ? model @entity178 and @entity180 ‘ i love it ! @entity182 on christmas morning , cracking open the @entity183 , eating as much as you can			0
i ’m quite traditional about it — this year i ’ll be picking up my old mum and bringing her over to ours ... that ’s what it ’s all about			1
’ his mother @entity189 is 96 , and his biggest fan			0
he says , she is particularly happy as this will be the first christmas @entity4 has spent married to wife @entity191 , who is 21 years his junior			1
although they have been together for years , they only tied the knot last december 30			0
‘ everyone thought they were just coming for lunch — then we sprang it on them that we were getting married			0
but i had to tell my mum before hand , in case she collapsed from the shock			0
‘ she ’s ever so pleased we finally did it			1
she was always going on to me before to make it nice and proper with @entity191			0
‘ i suppose i wanted to do it before she passed away			0
i knew i was going to spend the rest of my life with @entity191			0
she ’s the only one in the world for me			1
’ so how is married life treating him ? he sounds remarkably settled after a chequered romantic history			0
his first marriage , to dance partner @entity214 , when in their 20s , was a bit of a disaster			0
‘ oh it was lovely - jubbly at first because we were dancing together , but off the dancefloor , we had nothing in common			0
when we stopped performing , phhttt , that was it			0
she ran off with a @entity226			0
’ then came a relationship with @entity228 , the mother of his son @entity229			0
‘ i think the trouble was that i was quite a selfish person , ’ he admits			0
‘ i think it ’s quite common with men			1
not that i understood that at the time			0
‘ i remember once meeting a medium and he gave me a reading , which i thought was going to be a load of tosh			0
but he got a lot of stuff right , then told me i must never get married because i was too selfish			0
well , he was right			0
i was , and i am — although these days i ’m about as tenth as selfish			0
‘ part of me thinks that i just did n’t meet @entity191 at the right time , but maybe if i had met her 20 years ago it would n’t have worked , as i was a more selfish person			0
‘ i go out of my way to put her first now , that ’s new for me			1
saucy : @entity4 had a pop at @entity249 s @entity97 for a sexy routine ‘ i ’m quite domesticated , which i ca n’t say i was before			1
with my first wife i tried to polish the dining table once , but mistook oven cleaner for @entity254 and took the varnish off			0
it did n’t go down well			0
now , i make an effort			0
not really with the cooking — that ’s @entity191 ’s thing — but i am a lovely washer - upper , and like ironing			2
when @entity191 goes to work ( she runs their dance school ) , i get the ironing board set up and i get on with it			0
‘ i have a system actually : tea towels first , then handkerchiefs , then shirts and so on			0
’ married life clearly suits him — and he nags his son @entity229 , 27 , to tie the knot , too			0
‘ i mean , he ’s been with his girlfriend for years , but i would like them to get married , as i ’m ready to be a grandad			2

judge *suggests* @entity22 could take over from @entity276
says @entity79 is the most surprising contestant this year
vote ' keeps strictly successful ' , even if more talented dancers go home
@entity4 ’s @entity283 is on @entity284 , @entity140 at 9.20 *pm* .
