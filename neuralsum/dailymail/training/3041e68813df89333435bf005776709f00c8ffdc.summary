@entity0 has announced that it will ease restrictions on car imports for the first time in half a century , marking the end of an era that made icons of the island 's vintage automobiles			1
the official newspaper @entity9 said the decision to allow cars to be imported for sale at market prices on the island was taken wednesday by @entity0 's council of ministers			1
it said the decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles - automobiles , vans , trucks and motorcycles - and end the practice of granting some @entity0 special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege			1
more cars on the road : @entity0 streets have seen very few new cars over the past 50 years because of the embargo against foreign importers new era : the decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles and end the practice of granting some @entity0 special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege hanging out : a group of @entity0 remain atop a classic @entity43 car in @entity44 , watching one of the first automobile competitions with the support of @entity0 sports organizations new leaf : the government of @entity0 agreed to make more flexible the retail sales of new and used vehicles in the island allowing @entity0 to buy cars from government retailers without permissions @entity9 acknowledged the so - called ‘ letters of authorization ’ issued by the transport ministry had generated ‘ resentment , dissatisfaction and , in not a few cases ... ( were ) a source of speculation and enrichment			1
’ holders of the letters , however , will still be first in line to buy cars while the new system is phased in , @entity9 said			2
opening @entity0 's domestic car market to imports is likely to have fateful consequences for the lovingly maintained 1950s @entity74 , @entity75 and pontiacs that have survived a 50 - year - old @entity43 embargo			1
no official figures are available on @entity0 's automobile fleet , but experts believe there are around 60,000 @entity83 cars still circulating on the island			1
mixed in with them are @entity89 - made @entity87 and @entity88 cars made in the 1970s and ' 80s and more modern , usually @entity91 - made , vehicles imported by the government			1
mint condition @entity94 , @entity96 and @entity98 convertibles can still be seen carrying tourists around @entity44 , but most of the rolling relics from pre-revolutionary @entity0 are now used for collective public transportation			1
dying breed ? newlyweds cruise along a @entity44 street in one of @entity0 's many antique @entity83 automobiles			1
such sights may become increasingly rare following newly eased regulations on car imports old days : these antique throwbacks to the pre-embargo days have come to be used predominantly as taxicabs in the island nation @entity44 nights : a girl rides on a classic @entity43 car as part of her quinceanera coming of age beloved possessions : a woman waits beside her car prior to the annual classic car exhibition in @entity44 in august			0
the event included around 60 vintage cars into the sunset : @entity0 authorities announced december 19 that new cars may now be imported to the county and sold at market prices , further endangering the already dwindling classic @entity83 cars x @entity0 was the leading importer of @entity83 manufactured cars by the early 1950s			1
by 1955 , the island nation was home to 125,000 @entity138 - made cars			2
@entity0 were enamored with the so - called chariots of @entity140 , so much so that the ' 57 @entity142 's debut in @entity44 -- which , astonishingly , came before the car 's @entity43 premier -- attracted a crowd of 40,000			1
but in 1959 , @entity146 and his revolutionaries seized power in @entity0 and immediately set about changing the nation 's relationship with @entity43			1
@entity146 's regime sought greater communalism and nationalism			0
his country 's love affair with the @entity83 car , a symbol of both capitalist success and excess , had to go			0
‘ the @entity94 does not provide jobs for anyone , ’ @entity146 said shortly after seizing power			0
‘ the @entity94 does not increase the wealth of the country			0
’ the dictator halted all imports of @entity83 - made cars			2
only those who owned cars in or before 1959 were granted ful private ownership of the automobile			2
for everyone else , that right was revoked from then on			0
from that day on , for the next half century , @entity0 would be forced out of both a necessity and a deep sense of nostalgia to meticulously maintain their vehicles			1
over 50 years later , in november 2011 , the restrictions on the sale of one 's personal car would finally be lifted in @entity0			1
the antique @entity94 , chevrolets , and @entity183 could suddenly change hands			0
and on december 13 , 2013 , @entity0 officials voted to allow the sale of imported cars on the island for the first time since the revolution			1
one more step : this is the latest sign of liberalization on the part of the communist regime led by @entity146 ( seen shaking president @entity196 's had during @entity198 's memorial service ) the changes are a long - awaited element of president @entity146 's attempts to gradually liberalize @entity0 's @entity89 - style economy			2
the government in september 2011 allowed @entity0 and foreigners living on the island to sell their used cars to one another			1
‘ we 've been waiting for this for 20 years , ’ said a 54 - year - old professional in @entity44 , who would not give his name			0
@entity211 , a 41 - year - old taxi driver , also welcomed the news			0
‘ now anyone who has money will be able to buy a car			0
there were a lot of people who had received money from their families ( outside @entity0 ) and were n't able to , ’ he said			2
@entity9 provided few specifics on how the broader car market will work , saying the new rules would be made public in the coming days			0
market flood to come : because of the restricted supply , car prices in @entity0 are already astronomical and the cars that were imported from before the embargo are kept in mint condition rainy days : a man rides his tricycle taxi beside a car held up on concrete blocks , one of many vintage @entity83 automobiles that lasted well past their glory days ni the @entity239 nation a man cycles beside a @entity43 - made car used as a private collective taxi , parked beside a mural of the @entity0 national flag , in @entity44			1
collective taxis , also known as almendron , have established routes around or near @entity44 , picking up and dropping off passengers along the way cheap ride : the price of a journey in these taxis ranges from $ 0.50 for a ride within the city to $ 1 for a 30km lift but it said pricing of new vehicles should be similar to that for used vehicles sold privately			0
that suggests the government will impose hefty taxes on sales of imported vehicles			0
because of the restricted supply , car prices in @entity0 are already astronomical			2
a basic @entity269 in good condition , for example , sells for around $ 12,000 , about as much as a ' 57 @entity75 that has gotten decades of use as a taxi			0
a @entity94 convertible , like those that cruise the @entity44 waterfront with tourists aboard , can cost up to $ 80,000			0
for most @entity0 , with salaries that average just $ 20 a month , owning a car is still just a dream			2
in the meantime , @entity9 said , proceeds from car sales are to go to finance upgrades to @entity0 's public transportation system			2
an old @entity287 sits regally in a @entity44 parking lot			0
some estimate as many as 60,000 vintage cars populate @entity0			1
others place the number as high as 200,000 , the bulk of which are @entity83 made self - made : @entity295 drives his self - made taxi ( r ) along a street , looking for customers near @entity44			0
@entity299 , 40 , a mechanic , made the vehicle from recovered motorcycle and car parts			0
he charges customers 10 pesos per person per trip			0

@entity0 has only allowed a very limited number of cars to be imported
comes as a result of an embargo
now the *licensing* laws are going to be *loosened*
