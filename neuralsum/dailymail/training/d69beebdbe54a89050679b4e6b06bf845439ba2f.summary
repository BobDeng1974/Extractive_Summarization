@entity0 has never been one to shy away from controversy , having previously used transgender models and a topless @entity3 on his catwalks			0
so it should come as no surprise to see bearded drag queen and @entity9 winner @entity7 gracing the catwalk for his haute couture autumn / winter 2014 show			1
@entity7 , the female alter - ego of 25 - year - old @entity7 , closed the couture show yesterday on the @entity14 in @entity15			1
it was evidently a proud moment for @entity0 , who took to one knee in front of the @entity31 singer			0
@entity7 was not the only alternative model to grace the catwalk , with 56 - year - old @entity35 model @entity34 also making an appearance before taking a tumble while on the runway			1
changing perceptions : @entity0 is known for making political statements through his model casting not like a virgin : @entity7 wore a black bridal dress completed with black wedding veil @entity0 went down on one knee in front of his new friend @entity7 rising star : @entity7 has gone from strength to strength following her win at the @entity9 details : @entity7 had jewels laid out around her hairline and wore an impressive pair of false eyelashes the collection itself featured dark , @entity60 pieces , including black fur coats , paneled leather pencil skirts and circular crinoline skirts			1
@entity0 's most breath - taking piece was one he named ' @entity65 ' - inspired by @entity67 's recent role as the @entity69 villain - which saw a model wearing a black bustier with mink bands and dark crepe pants holding out a mirror in which she stared , pouted and cackled			2
controversial : 56 - year - old @entity35 model @entity34 also took to the runway oops ! the model unfortunately took a tumble during her catwalk appearance the use of drag in the designers show attracted much support and admiration from his fans including director , @entity87 who brought drag - queens to our screens in films such as @entity92 and @entity93			1
the director , spurred on by the liberated show , spoke openly about gay rights , praising @entity0 for his groun - breaking approach			1
' @entity0 was always about transgender sexuality , about high and low , ' he added ' for him to be having his show crowned by the grand dame of drag queen or transsexual expression is appropriate			2
' wicked : @entity0 's collection is inspired by @entity105 the 51 - year - old director referred to the recent backlash against gay rights around the world , especially in @entity110 and several @entity112 states , adding that seeing @entity7 in a mainstream fashion show indicates that gay rights are advancing			1
' what you see is a sort of reaction against how successful it 's been			0
' this was not the first encounter between @entity0 and @entity121 ; the pair met at the 2014 @entity123 , one of the world 's largest aids charities			0
full support : director , @entity87 praised @entity0 on changing the perceptions of gay rights			1
he is seen arriving at the show with his wife @entity132 ( right ) they were spotted later , hand in hand , at the @entity136 dinner at the @entity137			2
@entity0 's controversial approach has seen him reap financial rewards : ' i can say yes , it is profitable			0
i love it as we have more and more clients			0
i am proud to be a designer of couture			0
' he says the secret of his success is to make wearable clothes , but to not compromise on the couture craftsmanship			0
