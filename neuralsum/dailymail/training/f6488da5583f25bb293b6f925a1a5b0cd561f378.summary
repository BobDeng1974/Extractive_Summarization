next time you settle down for a spot of @entity3 with your children , take a proper look at the faces on the figures			1
because while you may remember life in @entity10 as being perfectly content , these day things are a little more fraught			0
a study has revealed that the faces of @entity3 characters are getting angrier			1
in the past , they all had a standard enigmatic smile			0
but this has changed as more sets are designed to tie in with films , often featuring battles between good and evil			0
lego characters are slowly getting angrier , say researchers who found that since the product launched in 1975 , the proportion of angry faces has been rising			1
for the first 11 years after @entity3 was introduced , all characters were happy ' @entity3 themes have been increasingly based on conflicts [ such as @entity29 or @entity30 ]			1
often a good force is struggling with a bad one , ' say the researchers @entity34 , of @entity36 's @entity35 , has published research showing that @entity3 characters are becoming more conflict - oriented , and the human figures featured in @entity3 sets are getting angrier			1
the study found that @entity3 figures most frequently feature happy or angry expressions , but since their introduction in 1975 , the proportion of angry faces has been rising			1
the findings also raise questions about the role of the design of toys and its impact on children , say the researchers			1
previous research has shown that facial expressions are universal across languages and cultures , with the six most widely used being disgust , happiness , sadness , fear , anger and surprise			0
there are fears that the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts how children play according to the study , ' analysis shows that toy design has become a more complex design space in which the imaginary world of play does not only consist of a simple division of good versus evil , but a world in which heroes are scared and villains can have superior smile			2
' however , it was the six most prominent facial expressions identified among @entity3 characters that are possible cause for concern : disdain , confidence , concern , fear , happiness , and anger			1
it was only in the 1990s that @entity3 began to introduce a wider variety of facial expressions to characters			1
for the first 11 years , only one smiley face was produced			1
happiness and anger remain the most widely used , but now occur in greater range of intensity : two distinct versions of both happiness and anger were found among the characters			2
' @entity3 themes have been increasingly based on conflicts [ such as @entity29 or @entity30 ]			2
often a good force is struggling with a bad one , ' says @entity34			0
' the facial expressions are not directly matched to good and evil			0
even the good characters suffer in their struggle and the villians can have a smug expression			2
in any case , the variety of faces has increased considerably			0
' ' we can not help but wonder how the move from only positive faces to an increasing number of negative faces impacts how children play			2
the new faces of @entity3 : disdain , confidence , concern , fear , happiness and anger ' designers of agent faces should take great care to design the expressions and to test their effect since toys play an important role in the development of children			1
' ' instead of focusing on highly realistic expressions , it may be worthwhile to increase the variability of expressions			0
a comic style expression is sufficient to convey a full spectrum of emotions and intensities			0
' @entity34 will present the paper on his findings at the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , in august			0
the @entity151 company @entity3 is one of the biggest toy manufacturers in the world , and produced more that 36 billion bricks distributed to 130 countries in 2010 alone , equivalent to 75 bricks each for everyone on @entity159			2
to mark the 150th anniversary of @entity161 , @entity3 has built a series of @entity161 maps which show how the @entity164 has changed over time			1
the maps are currently on display at @entity167 and other large stations across @entity161			0
they are made out of nothing but @entity3 and show how the tube map looked in 1927 and how it has changed over the years			1
@entity3 has created a series of @entity161 maps which show how the network has changed over the years			1
image shows how the map looked in 1968 according to @entity178 , the maps even show how the network will look in 2020			0
the tube maps , which were made by @entity181 , are each built from more than 1,000 @entity3 bricks			2
each one took mr @entity181 four days to put together			0
once the maps have finished their tour of @entity161 stations , they will be put on show at the @entity189 .			0

for the first 11 years after @entity3 was introduced , all characters were happy
but angry characters were then introduced and over time , the proportion of angry faces has been rising , say @entity36 researchers
*experts* are questioning the impact of ' angry ' toys on children
