by @entity1 reporter published : 06:51 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 27 march 2012 the government ’s controversial @entity2 became law today , after a tortuous 14 - month passage through @entity6			1
deputy speaker @entity8 's announcement in the @entity9 that the @entity10 had granted @entity11 to the bill was greeted by cries of ' shame ' from opposition @entity14			0
the proposals were first tabled in @entity6 in january 2011 , but were subjected to an unprecedented ' pause ' last year as health secretary @entity18 struggled to secure the support of healthcare workers			1
health workers demonstrating outside @entity6 last week against the @entity23 reforms			1
the @entity2 became law today the reforms were then amended more than 1,000 times during a lengthy passage through the @entity27			0
the new rules mean the government can create gp commissioning groups to buy healthcare for patients and scrap @entity33 ( @entity34 )			2
@entity35 has bitterly opposed the passage of the new law , insisting it threatens the foundation of the @entity23 and paves the way for private services to get too heavily involved			1
testing times : health secretary @entity18 faced a huge backlash from doctors ' unions a draft risk register leaked today showed that ministers were warned 18 months ago of the risk that the reforms could lead to a loss of financial control , reduced productivity and emergencies being less well managed			1
the @entity53 , which refused to comment on today ’s leak , has resisted a ruling from the information commissioner that it should release the final version of the risk register in response to a freedom of information request from @entity35			0
shadow health secretary @entity61 said today ’s document published in @entity63 showed that ministers were warned before they launched the @entity65 that it was ' likely to cause major damage to the @entity23 '			2
the document was produced on september 28 2010 , and it is not known what changes were made before the completion of the transition risk register on november 10			0
the @entity65 , which will devolve 60 per cent of the @entity23 ’s budget to new gp - led consortia , has changed fundamentally since that date , with more than 1,000 amendments during its passage through @entity6			1
identifying 43 separate areas of potential risk , the draft register rates each on a scale of one to five , where a rating of one means little likelihood and very low impact and five means almost certain to occur and very high impact			0
the likelihood and impact figures are multiplied together to give an overall risk rating , with a maximum score of 25			0
among 13 areas given a risk rating of 16 - with likelihood and impact each assessed at four out of five - were : other dangers , considered to have a lower rating of 12 , included the risk that ' @entity23 role in emergency preparedness / responsiveness is more difficult to manage through a more devolved organisation , and so emergencies are less well managed / mitigated '			2
the risk report warned @entity23 emergency care could be more difficult to manage through a more devolved organisation staff concerns and union action over the reforms could lead to ' deterioration in relations , lower productivity in the @entity53 / @entity23 and delays in programme ' , the document said			1
and there was a warning that strategic health authorities and primary care trusts might lose “ good people ” who then have to be re-employed to run the new system			2
mr @entity61 said : ' now we know why @entity124 refused to publish the risk register before the @entity65 was through @entity6 - it ’s because civil servants were telling him his reorganisation was likely to cause major damage to the @entity23			1
' @entity124 will never be forgiven for knowingly taking these risks with the country ’s best - loved institution			0
' a @entity53 spokesman said : ' we do not comment on leaks			0
we have always been open about risk and have published all relevant information in the impact assessments alongside the @entity65			0
' as the latest performance figures show , we are dealing with those risks , performance is improving - waiting times are down and mixed - sex wards are at an all - time low - and we are on course to make the efficiency savings that the @entity23 needs to safeguard it for the future			2

the @entity23 reform proposals were first tabled in @entity6 in january 2011
*parliamentary* amendments creating ' *unforeseen* *consequences* for the system ' ;
costs being driven up by @entity156 consortia using private sector organisations and staff ;
*implementation* beginning before *adequate* *planning* has been done ;

' *unhelpful* conflict ' between the @entity23 commissioning board and regulator *monitor* ;
