by @entity0 it is the sunshine enclave that has long lured @entity3 holidaymakers to its beaches – and its popularity shows no sign of waning , according to a new survey			2
what ’s more , this much - visited place in the sun is not @entity12 , but its neighbour @entity14			2
research by a holiday insurance firm into what – in the eyes of @entity3 travellers – makes for a great holiday destination , has placed @entity22 ’s most south - westerly country in the top spot			1
a place in the sun : with pretty towns such as @entity28 , @entity14 's @entity26 is big with @entity3 schofields questioned 2,614 @entity3 holidaymakers who have enjoyed a beach break in the past 12 months , and stayed in a holiday home			2
the study asked them to rate five @entity22 holiday enclaves on the basis of accommodation , food , entertainment , local welcome , and overall enjoyment factor			0
@entity14 achieved an impressive total of 41 out of a possible 50 , and scored highly ( out of 10 ) on accommodation ( nine ) , food ( eight ) , entertainment ( seven ) , local welcome ( eight ) and overall enjoyment ( nine )			1
this meant that it eclipsed @entity49 ( 38 out of 50 ) , the @entity3 ( 35 ) and @entity50 ( 32 )			0
@entity51 , perhaps surprisingly , finished bottom of the poll with a total score of 30 , and low ratings of just five for local welcome and six for overall enjoyment			1
it might be suggested that the absence from the survey of @entity12 – a country that has almost become a second home for @entity3 – rather detracts from the results			0
grab your bucket , bring a spade : the beaches along the south coast of the @entity26 are a haven for sun - seekers but equally , @entity14 offers plenty of attractions to please sun - worshippers seeking a week on a lounger – not least its southern @entity26 region , where the likes of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 are festooned with hotels in sight of the seafront			0
‘ @entity14 seems to be the destination of choice at the moment for @entity3 holidaymakers , ’ says @entity82 of @entity83			1
‘ what we found interesting is that the high point of almost every holiday is the accommodation , which scores highest or joint highest out of the categories for all countries except @entity50			0
’ while the @entity3 only finished third in the table , it did top a sub-category			0
according to the survey , holidaymakers who had stayed in the @entity3 were twice as likely to return to the same place compared to those who had holidayed anywhere else in @entity22 .			1

@entity14 scores an impressive 41 out of 50 when *assessed* as destination
