frozen salt and vinegar crisp , anyone ? we all know freezing is a great way of preserving foods			1
but believe it or not , the process can make some things taste even better			2
from cakes to curries , freezing brings out more of their flavour and boosts the texture			1
here , @entity16 puts a host of our favourite foods to the frozen test			1
cakes if you think nothing beats the gooey deliciousness of a home - made cake fresh from the oven , think again			2
resist the temptation to cut that first slice straight away and , instead , put your cake into the freezer			2
freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever after being frozen for 24 hours , the sponge will be even bouncier because this process boosts the moisture , so you get an even creamier and softer centre			1
let your cake cool entirely , then put it into the freezer without a wrapping			2
once frozen solid , wrap it in @entity47 , and it can be kept frozen for up to three months			1
when you are ready to tuck in , defrost for up to three hours , until thawed			2
herbs and spices keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process			1
once defrosted , it also makes them softer , so all their lovely juices seep out more readily and the flavours are more potent			2
tough herbs such as rosemary and thyme preserve the best , but ginger , lemongrass , garlic and chilli will last up to six months when frozen			1
by keeping fresh herbs in the freezer you will intensify their flavour because they take on moisture during the freezing process just pop stems in a plastic container and freeze			1
you can sprinkle frozen chilli , garlic and ginger into stews , fishcakes or curries			1
frozen herbs are also brilliant in pies , pasta and pestos			1
you can even freeze them in ice cube trays with a drizzle of water			0
that way , they can go straight into a stew or soup — no defrosting needed			0
@entity96 left out for just a few hours , crisps will start going stale and soggy			0
but even wrapping left - overs in clingfilm to seal out the oxygen wo n’t keep them super crunchy			0
crisps have a tendency to go stale and soggy once they have been left out for a few hours but this problem can be solved if you simply pop them in an airtight back and put them in the freezer so if you ’ve ever found yourself scoffing a big bag just so that they are n’t wasted , stop right now			0
pop the crisps in an airtight bag and place them in the freezer			0
they will stay fresh for at least two months			0
by extracting air , freezing makes the crisps crunchier and they can even be eaten straight from frozen			1
nuts once you open a bag of nuts , the clock starts ticking			0
as nuts have a high oil content , they go rancid very quickly			0
now , you have a solution — freezing will preserve the flavour and texture instantly			1
due to the high oil content of nuts , they go rancid very quickly but freezing them will preserve the flavour and texture right away to freeze peanuts , walnuts , pecans , macadamias , cashews , hazelnuts and almonds ( shelled or unshelled ) , wrap them in clingfilm , then place them in a resealable bag			1
they will keep for up to a year and , when you want to eat them , they ’ll defrost in less than an hour			0
@entity142 @entity143 up with struggling to peel the skins off tomatoes ? freeze them first then , once thawed for two hours , the skin will come off easily			0
that ’s because the freezing process loosens the skins			1
while you probably wo n’t want to use frozen tomatoes in salads , as it makes the flesh slightly squishy , it does intensify the flavour			1
peeling the skin off tomatoes can be really tricky , but if you freeze them and let them thaw for a couple of hours the skin will come off much more easily so , once defrosted , you can use your tomatoes to make richer sauces for pasta and stews , or as a topping for pizzas			0
alternatively , before freezing , roast your tomatoes at a gentle temperature with garlic , fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil for up to four hours			1
when cooled , transfer them to freezer bags			0
use in chilli or home - made tomato sauces			0
@entity179 curries do n’t only have to be enjoyed the first time round — you can freeze the leftovers and reheat when needed			0
freezing a curry is a great way to make the most of leftovers especially because as the curry cools the flavours and aromas combine to create even better seasoning and hey presto ! , they taste even yummier			1
that ’s because , as the curry cools , the flavour and aroma compounds mingle together , developing more seasoned notes			0
the individual flavours you tasted the first time around , such as cinnamon , garlic and nutmeg , are still there			0
but the effect is more mellow			0
@entity205 frozen raspberries are great scattered on muesli , added to ice cream or whizzed in smoothies			1
while freezing may make the berries a bit softer , it accentuates their sharp , fresh flavour , too			1
frozen raspeberries can be delicious when sprinkled through muesli , added to ice cream or whizzed into a tasty fruit smoothie place your berries in a single layer on a baking tray and put the tray in the freezer			1
once they are frozen , you can put them into an airtight bag or plastic container and store in the freezer			2
they will stay good for up to a year			0
bananas fancy a healthy , guilt - free ice cream ? then tuck into a frozen banana after dinner			2
bananas have a high pectin content , which gives them a creamy , rich texture when frozen — just like ice cream			2
when bananas are frozen they adopt a creamy , rich texture which makes them a great guilt - free ice cream to freeze , peel a ripe banana and chop into thin slices			1
put into an airtight container and freeze until solid ( around two hours )			0
decant the slices into a blender or food processor and whizz			2
in seconds , your frozen banana will look just like ice cream and taste every bit as yummy			2
scoop into a bowl and enjoy			0
for an indulgent treat , add chocolate chips or nut flakes .			0
