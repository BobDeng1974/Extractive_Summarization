the seemingly - innocent @entity1 machines that allow environmentally friendly users to carbonate their own water at home has come under fire for producing ‘ blood bubbles ’			0
the @entity8 company , which has just signed on @entity9 as their first @entity10 , runs three factories in the occupied @entity12 and many say the company is taking advantage of the @entity17 residents who have few other employment options			1
@entity1 has been around in one form or another for more than a century but it became a publicly traded company in 2010 and emerged on the @entity22 market over the past five or six years			0
the company ’s tagline - ‘ set the bubbles free ’ - and the good , clean feeling that comes with knowing that your carbonated beverage was also good for the environment play up the advantages , and the newly - minted spokeswoman is towing the party line			2
‘ my favorite thing about soda stream is that i do n't feel guilty when i enjoy beverages at home			0
i do n't feel i 'm being wasteful , ’ @entity9 said in a behind - the - scenes video showing the making of the @entity27 commercial			1
those declarations come as double - edged swords for the company , however , as critics say that the ‘ guilt - free ’ bubbles come at a truly human cost			2
hot bed : three of the company 's main production factories are located in the @entity8 - occupied @entity12 settlement of @entity68 ( pictured ) where rent is up to 69 % cheaper than in @entity8 the forward , one of the best - known @entity72 daily newspapers in the @entity22 , slammed the company , saying that it ' does exploit the commercial benefits of ( the factory 's ) location , essentially profiting from occupation '			1
specifically , rental rates for land in the settlement of @entity68 - where the @entity1 factory is located - can run up to 69 per cent cheaper than similar land across the @entity12 border in @entity8			1
the controversy surrounding the product is n't new , and they are finding enemies in their target audience of left - leaning environmentally conscientious foodies			1
one example comes from the @entity91 in @entity92 which used to sell the controversial filters			0
now they have turned against them and joined a @entity97 ( @entity97 ) movement and a group of members participated in a protest against the company in december			0
@entity103 issue : like many environmentalists , @entity9 , seen here with @entity106 , has said that she likes how users ' do n't feel guilty ' because @entity1 saves the use of plastic bottles the fizz of controversy surrounding the @entity27 ad is not the only concern for company executives , however , as their stock has taken a hit this quarter			1
they estimated lower profits than usual for this past holiday season - which ended up being on point - but they also said that the first half of 2014 would be a difficult time because of lower selling prices and high production costs that makes profit margins even more slim			0
their high came in june 2012 when the company was selling for $ 76 - per - share			2
the market closed today at $ 38.74 - per - share , marking a 20.5 per cent hit since this time last year .			0

the *actress* has signed on to be the face of the company and will star in their @entity27 ad
a number of left - leaning groups have *bashed* the @entity8 company for setting up their factories in the occupied *territories* of the @entity12
