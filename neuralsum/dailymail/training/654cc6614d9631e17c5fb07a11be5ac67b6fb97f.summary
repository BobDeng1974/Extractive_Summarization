he 's got a piercing stare , brooding expression and body that can whip female fans into a frenzy but for male supermodel @entity6 , he would prefer to keep his looks off - screen			1
the @entity10 - born hunk , 34 , who shot to fame wearing just his underpants in a @entity14 campaign in 2006 , is one of the most desired men on the planet and was offered the chance to play @entity18 in @entity18			1
but in an interview with @entity21 magazine he says that while he respects the film , the role - now played by @entity23 - would n't have been right for him			2
but was it right for me ? no. it just did n’t feel right , in any way			0
and in my gut , it felt right to say no. ' the hugely successful model , who is currently the co-designer and face of a new @entity30 campaign , revealed that he has been offered , and subsequently refused , several lead roles in box office hits			1
“ i was offered @entity18 , 300:2 , @entity55 , which a lot of people probably would have taken as actors but i ’m in the fortunate position where i like what i ’m doing			1
i do n’t feel the need to act , ' he said			0
and , while his legions of admirers may be bitterly disappointed not to see @entity6 in the role , which would have had him naked much of the time , it 's hard to see how he could have fitted it in			1
as well as a packed modelling schedule , @entity6 has recently taken a step into retail			1
the model loved his pair of @entity75 - designed @entity74 boots so much , he decided to buy the company			2
@entity6 in @entity75 shoes : the model loved his pair so much he decided to buy the company in january the label had a soft launch at @entity82 : men , for which mr @entity6 is also an ambassador			1
in an interview regarding his latest acquisition , the male supermodel , who has 230,000 followers on @entity90 , told fashion website @entity91 : ' it was always my aim - which sounds really strange as a model - not to always be in front of the camera but to turn the other way and have an input			1
' i do n't just do one campaign and move on			0
i go in there , i look at the team and i want to help the brand move in a different direction			0
@entity6 with girlfriend @entity105 from @entity107 watching the @entity108 at the @entity109 last year mr @entity6 's plans for his new brand are to ' create a lifestyle ' around the label and to think how men want to be seen in them			1
similarly his personal life is going from strength to strength , and his relationship with saturdays singer @entity105 keeps him busy outside of his work endeavors			0
the couple , whose 10 - month relationship came to an abrupt end in 2011 , confirmed they are back together in october last year and seem to be taking things very seriously			0
and of course , @entity6 's refusal led to former model @entity23 landing the coveted role of @entity18			1
despite the film having yet to be released , @entity23 's star has well and truly risen since accepting the part of the s&m - obsessed billionaire			0
the coveted role of @entity18 was taken by former model @entity133 ( right , in the role ) @entity23 , 32 , who has a baby daughter with wife @entity136 , admitted that he is taking a laissez - faire attitude to his increasing fame , and how his life will change once the film is released on febuary 13			2
taking to @entity140 about his experience at the @entity142 in january , he revealed : ' i ’m astonished at how many people are telling me my life is going to change			2
' everyone that i meet , especially in @entity147			0
people who run studios or other actors or people who are strangers			0
' everyone has been saying that to me : " are you ready ? " i do n’t have a good answer to that , because i do n’t know what i ’m meant to be ready for			0
i ’ll just roll with the punches			0
' the full interview with @entity6 is in the style special of @entity159 .			2
