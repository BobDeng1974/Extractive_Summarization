the @entity12 is a group of self - confessed ' non-traditional mothers ' who *'ve* put together a calendar to help tackle peoples perceptions of what a mom should look like
the movement was formed by @entity271 mom - of - two @entity16 in 2011 as a group for ' anyone who is or loves a tattooed mom '
it has since grown to include six group in the @entity278 , another two in the @entity279 and more than 700 members online
' i think we 're breaking a stereotype . just because we have tattoos does n't mean we ca n't raise amazing children , ' said @entity16 , who has 15 tattoos
tattooed - people usually love art and are strong mentally ; a little out of the *box* ; are n't afraid to be different .
*hippies* - *reject* the mores of established society ( as by dressing *unconventionally* or favoring *communal* living ) and *advocate* a *nonviolent* ethic .
**pirates** - took their codes of *loyalty* very seriously , never turning their back on each other ; they faced other **pirates** as a group , and their *success* depended on being a united front . they made their own rules and laws and did what they wanted .
mommas - the thing that brings them all together .
