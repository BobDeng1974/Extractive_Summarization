by @entity0 miss @entity1 came in third in the @entity5 contest , a disappointment for the @entity8 nation that has won more crowns in the pageant than any other country besides the @entity12 but @entity13 was the talk of the internet on thursday after she attempted to answer a question in @entity17 during the pageant 's finals			1
her answer was unintelligible at times - one of several examples where the language barrier came to the forefront during the pageant			1
' i think that any leys ( laws ) there are in @entity48 or in life , are already made			2
i think that we should have , uh , a straight way to go in our similar , or , eh , in our lives as is this			2
for example , i 'm a surfer , and i think that the best wave that i can take is the wave that i wait for it			1
so please do our only , eh , law that we can do			1
thank you , @entity57 ! ' better in a bikini ? bloggers and observers on @entity61 seized on the brunette beauty 's comment , with some lampooning her @entity17 and calling the answer nonsensical bloggers and observers on @entity61 seized on the brunette beauty 's comment , with some lampooning her @entity17 and calling the answer nonsensical			1
others defended her as brave for trying a second language under the glare of the spotlight			2
back home in pageant - crazy @entity1 , which has produced six past titleholders and numerous finalists , her loss was front - page news			2
an article in the newspaper @entity81 , noted @entity40 looked quite good , ' but an unintelligible answer in the round of questions lost her the crown			1
' because the pageant does n't release scores publicly , there 's no way to determine how the answer affected the outcome			1
the newspaper also referred readers to an online poll asking whether they liked @entity40 's response			2
about 90 per cent of those who answered , many of them in @entity1 , said ' no. ' while @entity40 stepped out with @entity17 , other finalists shied away from the pageant 's lingua franca			1
in videotaped interviews aired during the telecast , top 10 candidates @entity103 and miss @entity104 opted to talk about themselves in @entity41 and @entity108 , respectively			2
in the live interview , top - five contestant @entity109 took her question - about whether bikinis turn women into sex symbols - in @entity116 , and gave her answer in @entity116			1
the pageant has no language requirement and pageant spokeswoman @entity120 said organizers are proud their contestants come from around the globe			2
they have translators on hand to facilitate interviews for non-english speakers			0
accepting everyone : the pageant has no language requirement and pageant spokeswoman @entity120 said organizers are proud their contestants come from around the globe miss @entity135 @entity134 addressed the topic directly in the on - stage interview			0
when asked whether @entity17 should be a prerequisite for @entity5 because she 's an international ambassador , @entity134 gave this reply in her own , slightly accented @entity17			1

thank you , @entity57 ! ' ' for me , being @entity5 is not just about knowing how to speak a specific language			0
it 's being able to influence and inspire other people			0
so whatever language you have , as long as your heart is to serve and you have a strong mind to - to show to people , then you can be @entity5			0
' she got loud applause and cheers in reply			0
newly crowned @entity5 @entity164 may have a little trouble of her own with the language barrier			0
she either did n't hear or declined to answer when a reporter at a post-pageant press conference asked her in @entity41 whether she spoke @entity41			1
( @entity164 speaks some @entity169 , but not @entity41 )			0
knowing the language could be a big interviewing asset for a @entity5 winner - the pageant is a big enough hit among non-english speakers that it was simulcast in @entity41 on @entity176			0
@entity164 said she enjoyed the diversity of the contestants and did her best to help the non-english speakers navigate the @entity12 in the weeks before the competition			0
disappointment : @entity1 has won more titles than any other country so the loss came as a blow ' they looked at me for advice , for translation , for “ what does this button do , ” “ how do you get the paper out of the dispenser , ” ' she said on thursday			0
but she acknowledged that contestants from @entity17 - speaking countries are at a disadvantage			1
' it definitely makes it harder			0
but if you 're going into this job , i think you need to be prepared to speak @entity17 because you live in @entity202 and a lot of your events are in @entity202			1
and we speak @entity17 , ' she answered			1
last year 's winner , @entity208 beauty queen @entity207 , spoke in deliberate @entity17 , perhaps refined by @entity5 appearances and business management studies in @entity211			1
her road to the @entity5 crown last year in @entity214 involved winning over the crowd by speaking in @entity116 , their shared language			0
@entity208 , like @entity218 , is a former @entity116 colony .			0

@entity220 was asked what law she would change
refused to use a translator , opting to forge ahead in shaky @entity17
' for example , i 'm a surfer , and i think that the best wave that i can take is the wave that i wait for it , ' she said at one point in her *non-sensical* answer
