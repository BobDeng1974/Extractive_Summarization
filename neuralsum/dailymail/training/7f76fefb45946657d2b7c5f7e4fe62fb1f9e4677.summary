by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 17:26 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 09:01 est , 26 september 2012 @entity4 called in under - fire @entity5 for a face - to - face meeting after news broke that he had called police ‘ plebs ’ during his foul - mouthed @entity9 rant , it emerged tonight			1
the prime minister told mr @entity5 his behaviour was unacceptable , and the government chief whip said that he did not use the words attributed to him in reports but accepted he needed to apologise			1
he ' looked him in the eye ' , insisting he did n't use the word , sources said			0
mr @entity4 has since read an official police log showing he called officers ' f * * * * * * plebs ' , but is expected to stand by mr @entity5			1
but to further undermine mr @entity5 ’s explanation for his rant , it also emerged today that the ‘ long and extremely frustrating day ’ which he blamed for his foul - mouthed tirade at police officers included lunch at @entity29 ’s poshest curry house , the @entity45			1
the full police log for the confrontation reveals details of the moment mr @entity5 was told by officers to use a side gate to leave @entity9 , and not the main gates reserved for ministerial cars			1
mr @entity5 repeatedly stated that he was the chief whip and demanded the main gates be opened , the log says			1
after several refusals he eventually made his way to the side gate , where he let rip at officers			0
the police log states : ‘ there were several members of public present as is the norm opposite the pedestrian gate and as we neared it , mr @entity5 said : “ best you learn your f * * * * * * place ... you do n't run this f * * * * * * @entity73 ... you 're * * * * * * * plebs			1
” ‘ the members of public looked visibly shocked and i was somewhat taken aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior government official			0
i can not say if this statement was aimed at me individually , or the officers present or the police service as a whole			2
’ in a hugely embarrassing escalation of the stand - off , officers then threatened mr @entity5 with arrest under the @entity88 for swearing , a move backed by mr @entity33			1
@entity29 mayor @entity33 used a visit to @entity91 to say police should have arrested @entity5 the @entity29 mayor said today : ' in my book you should n’t abuse police officers and i ’ve made that clear loads of times			1
' if i read the papers correctly there was a proposal to arrest mr @entity5 for what he said			2
that seems to be wholly common - sensical			0
' the public order act does allow for police officers ’ discretion in this matter			0
they ’ve obviously decided not to go ahead with it			0
but it shows the gravity of this offence			0
' a @entity115 poll found more than two - thirds of voters accepted the police account that mr @entity5 called officers ' plebs ' after they refused to let him cycle through the main gates of @entity9			1
more than half the 1,739 adults questioned in the online survey - 52 per cent - said they thought he should resign			0
earlier today one of mr @entity5 's daughters told reporters outside the family home : ' i can tell you one thing - my father is an honest man			1
' the official police log of what @entity5 said to officers in @entity9 @entity136 , the @entity137 treasury chief secretary , today condemned the outburst			2
' @entity5 has apologised for what he did			0
it was clearly totally wrong for anyone to go around swearing at police officers but certainly for cabinet ministers			2
' he has apologised for that , i gather he has apologised directly to the police			0
i think we should draw a line under the matter now			0
" however the full police log , reported by the @entity151 , will dash any hopes among senior government figures of drawing a line under the row			0
mr @entity5 has pointedly refused to deny using the word ‘ pleb ’ – a politically damaging remark which reinforces the impression of an out of touch @entity161 elite			2
but the contemporaneous note from an on - duty police officer makes for devastating reading			2
to make matters worse , it also emerged that mr @entity5 had spent part of the day at one of @entity172 's smartest restaurants			1
@entity5 's ' long and incredibly frustrating day ' included lunch at the @entity45 in @entity174 , @entity29 which is within walking distance of several government departments famed for its upmarket @entity179 cuisine , the @entity45 menu includes fillet steak of @entity182 beef with stir - fried morels and saffron sauce , costing £ 95 mr @entity5 has in part blamed a ' long and frustrating day ' for losing his temper , but @entity188 newspaper today claims he spent part of that day enjoying lunch at the @entity45 where main courses start at around £ 20 , but the fillet steak of @entity182 beef with stir - fried morels and saffron sauce costs £ 95			1
ex-government adviser @entity195 told @entity188 he was dining at the restaurant at the time near mr @entity5 , and said : ' he did n't seem to be having a long and frustrating day to me			1
' it is thought he was there for around an hour and a half			0
@entity9 confirmed that mr @entity5 had eaten at the curry house , but stressed : ‘ it was a lunch , not a long lunch			1
’ mr @entity5 yesterday broke his silence with an apology outside the @entity206			2
there was speculation he might be on the verge of saying something dramatic , or even offering his resignation			0
but , in the event , a clearly uncomfortable mr @entity5 denied using the ‘ words that have been attributed to me ’ – but refused to say exactly what he had told the police			1
this stubborn reluctance to discuss the precise language last wednesday evening meant he was bombarded with fresh questions			0
claims : mr @entity5 denied using the words attributed to him , but pointedly refused to deny he had using the classist slur ' pleb ' against the officers cabinet secretary sir @entity224 last night rejected @entity226 ’s call for a full inquiry into the incident , and attempted to close down the affair			1
in a letter to shadow home secretary @entity232 , sir @entity224 said mr @entity4 had spoken to mr @entity5 and ‘ made very clear that his behaviour fell short of what he expects of his ministers ’			1
sir @entity224 said there was a ‘ genuine difference of view ’ about what mr @entity5 had said			1
he said he had discussed the incident with metropolitan police commissioner @entity243 who was also ‘ very disappointed at the lack of respect shown towards the police ’			0
but he said mr @entity243 did not wish to pursue the matter as the officers concerned had accepted mr @entity5 ’s apology			1
the @entity250 however faced a backlash when it emerged it was launching a leak inquiry to find out how details of the clash were passed to the media			0
@entity9 backed the chief whip , saying mr @entity4 accepted his version of events and believed it was time to ‘ move on ’			1
but their stance infuriated the police , who said their officers were effectively being accused of lying			0
@entity265 , chairman of the @entity266 , called on mr @entity4 to hold an investigation			2
‘ clearly mr @entity5 is denying using certain words , effectively now impugning the integrity of the police officers , ’ he said			1
two - wheeled terror : mr @entity5 had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike into @entity9 when he made the outburst at police @entity232 , @entity226 's shadow home secretary , today demanded the truth about the incident from the mr @entity4			1
she told @entity278 's @entity277 : ' you read these reports and you have got a cabinet minister not just swearing at the police but also sneering at them , calling them plebs , saying they should know their place			2
' i do n't think the prime minister can just dismiss this and try and sweep this under the carpet			0
' yesterday mr @entity5 acknowledged that he had not shown the police ‘ the amount of respect i should have done ’ but said the incident had come at ‘ the end of a long and extremely frustrating day ’			1
one senior @entity161 said colleagues had been ‘ surprised ’ by mr @entity5 ’s grudging statement , adding : ‘ we expected him to be far more contrite			2
’ shortly after his tirade at the police , the minister headed off to dine at the @entity303 , a private club for @entity25 members in the exclusive @entity306 ’ area of @entity29 , where he was guest speaker			2
yesterday deputy prime minister @entity307 said it was ‘ really important that @entity5 explains fully and in detail his version of events ’			2
and @entity312 , the @entity313 minister , said the apology left unanswered questions			0
he added : ' i think people want to know what was said			0
explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said , so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up			0
' friends of mr @entity5 last night said he was ‘ categoric ’ that he had not used the word pleb			2
one ally claimed officers may have misheard him say the word ‘ plod ’			0
last night it was suggested that the firearms officers at the centre of the row face being moved from @entity9 when they return to duty today to keep them out of the spotlight			0
video : @entity5 was wrong and totally inappropriate says @entity136			0

detailed account from police records provides devastating account of the moment @entity5 lost his temper after being told to get off his bike
@entity33 says it would have been common sense for the chief whip to have been arrested
the new chief whip blames a ' long and frustrating day ' - which he spent dining at @entity354 , @entity29 's poshest curry house
minister 's daughter tells reporters : ' my father is an honest man . '
@entity4 and cabinet secretary sir @entity224 reject calls for a full inquiry , claiming officers had accepted mr @entity5 's apology
