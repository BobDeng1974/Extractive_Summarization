dozens of balloons were released at the @entity2 as a sign of peace today - a year after two doves were viciously attacked by other birds at the same ceremony			1
the bloody conclusion to the peace service in 2014 appears to have forced the @entity11 's officials to cancel the tradition , replacing the age - old symbols with a more modern alternative			0
animal welfare groups were outraged by last year 's disaster - claiming the @entity2 did not do enough to protect the doves used during the ceremony			1
@entity35 said , ' here 's the balloons that mean peace , ' as the youngsters let go of the colourful toys			2
one of the balloons was filled with hot air and contained messages promoting global peace , while a child read out a speech on the same theme			0
the @entity2 announced last week that balloons would replace doves for this year 's ceremony , but did not explain the reasons behind the switch			1
contrast : last year the @entity11 released two doves in @entity22 during the equivalent ceremony attack : one of the doves was set upon by a crow as thousands of worshippers looked on in january 2014 pope @entity59 started the tradition of releasing doves on the last sunday of january every year , as the first month is traditionally dedicated to the @entity63 's message of peace			1
but the ceremony became controversial last year , after the pair of doves were set upon by a crow and a seagull to the shock of thousands of onlookers			1
the two birds apparently escaped - but still aroused the fury of animal rights activists , who claimed that the @entity2 should have anticipated the likelihood of the doves getting in trouble			2
@entity22 has a large population of gulls living on its colonnade - one group said that taking a smaller bird into the square was equivalent to issuing a death sentence			0
brutal : the other bird was attacked by a seagull , leading to an animal rights controversy they appealed directly to the @entity11 , pointing out that he chose the name @entity35 after the patron saint of animals , @entity94			0
earlier this week , the pontiff courted controversy when he appeared to criticise the murdered journalists of @entity98 , saying that freedom of speech should not extend to the mockery of religion			0
he insisted that people ' can not insult the faith of others ' , adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother .			0

doves are traditionally released in @entity22 at the end of january
