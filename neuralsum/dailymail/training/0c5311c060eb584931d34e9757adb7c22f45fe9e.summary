struggle : @entity48 said @entity26 , left , ' went downhill ' after @entity14 was discovered dead and later committed suicide her husband @entity32 told the hearing how she then resorted to making a call to the helpline herself , claiming to be suicidal , in a bid to gauge the response her son might have received			1
when a @entity6 worker told her she could stay in a ‘ safe house ’ , it gave the full - time mother false hope that this is what had happened to her missing son , mr @entity14 suggested			1

coroner @entity100 said : ‘ i am sure the uncertainty relating to the death of [ mrs @entity21 ’s ] son and the absence of any information and no co-operation from the @entity6 may well have contributed to her death			1
’ only when the coroner threatened to issue a summons for the head of the charity to give evidence did the @entity6 eventually agree to co-operate with the inquest			1
in the end it was ‘ of no use ’ to the inquiry , the coroner added			0

@entity124 , chief executive of @entity6 , right , said : ' we offer our sincere condolences to the @entity14 family			1
' it 's important to remember that suicide is a complex issue and is seldom the result of a single factor but likely to have several inter-related causes			0
' samaritans has the utmost respect for our callers ' privacy and we take this issue very seriously			0
this is an essential and greatly valued feature of the service we provide			0
' we believe that without our promise to keep everything confidential , people who have the greatest need might never have the courage or trust to speak to us			0
this confidentiality has been in place since @entity6 was founded sixty years ago			2
since then we 've received more than 115 million calls which clearly demonstrate the trust that the wider community has in @entity6 and the importance of maintaining our confidentiality policy			2
' in order to retain the integrity of our service this policy remains in place even if we never hear from our caller again			0
' there are only four circumstances in which @entity6 will release information obtained during a call , in these circumstances we will fully co-operate by sharing the information held with the relevant authorities : if a caller directly asks us to pass on information to someone else ; we receive a court order requiring us to share information ; we receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings ; the safety of our volunteers or the delivery of our service is threatened , for example by making it difficult for other people to get hold of us			1
' mr @entity100 said the inquest into @entity14 ’s death had been delayed because of the attitude of the charity			1
only when he threatened @entity6 ’ chief executive , @entity124 , with a witness summons did they eventually agree to disclose information			1
in the end it was ‘ of no use ’ to the inquiry , the coroner added			0
the organisation said @entity14 ’s call had been classed as ‘ category one ’ , which is not considered to pose a risk to life			0
mr @entity100 said : ‘ they ( @entity6 ) were concerned that they might be disclosing confidential information or conversations relating to the deceased person and his family			2
' when i explained all i wanted was to try and find out what had happened to @entity14 , to know his intentions , and to try to work out how he came to be in the sea , that led to a change of attitude			0
