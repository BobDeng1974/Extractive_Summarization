by @entity0 published : 04:51 est , 31 august 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 31 august 2013 pensioner @entity1 leaves court on her @entity4 frame after being found guilty of racially abusing a family of gypsies a grandmother aged 78 was yesterday convicted of racially abusing a family of gipsies as a long - running dispute over an illegal caravan site boiled over			1
former sunday school teacher and community stalwart @entity12 claimed she was sworn at and intimidated when she backed her @entity14 through the gates of their camp to turn it around			1
but the respected toyshop owner was fingerprinted and ordered to provide a dna sample after the gipsies told police she had shouted racist abuse at them			0
yesterday she found herself with a criminal record for the first time in her life after a district judge rejected her account and found her guilty of racially - aggravated harassment			1
afterwards the widow - who arrived at court in a wheelchair after suffering a fall - said she was ' stunned ' by the verdict and said she was considering lodging an appeal			0
the ex-school governor claimed she was driving back from the toyshop she has run for six decades in a @entity39 market town when she found the narrow lane to her home of 40 years partially blocked by a van			1
she said she had previously seen it parked on an illegal traveller site built on green belt land beside the lane which the local council has spent tens of thousands of pounds in an unsuccessful attempt to evict			2
the former secretary of the local chamber of trade told @entity52 magistrates court she scraped her car trying to squeeze past , so decided to reverse back down the lane and turn around in the entrance to the site then return to nearby @entity56			1
@entity1 told the court one of the @entity59 gipsies who owns the camp , @entity62 , came running over shouting : ' what the f * * * * * * hell are you doing on my land ? ' the 5ft pensioner claimed she felt ' intimidated ' by mr @entity62 and his 72 - year - old father - in - law @entity71 ' over her but told them : ' you 're not supposed to be on this land , it 's green belt			1
' @entity1 claimed the only time she swore was when she asked them what the ' f * * * * * * nuisance ' was about , and denied using racist language before she drove off			1
however mr @entity62 told the court he had merely walked over to see why she had driven onto the plot and that @entity1 confronted him over the damage her car had suffered			0
the self - employed builder said he had told her the van blocking the lane was n't his , at which she started ' shouting and screaming ' and saying : ' look at my f * * * * * * wheel			1
' mr @entity62 said he again denied responsibility , at which she said : ' i 'm f * * * * * * sick of you lot , you 're illegal , you should all f * * * off you dirty f * * * * * * gypos			1
' ' @entity59 gipsies are probably the only ethnic minorities left that still gets abused - people think it 's ok , ' he told the court			2
victim : @entity109 abused : husband @entity62 insulted : @entity110 ' my mother - in - law 's a similar age and if she came out with that sort of language i 'd be disgusted			1
' mr @entity110 's wife @entity116 , who was watching from beside her caravan , told the court : ' my husband was so upset i had to make him a cup of tea			0
' shortly afterwards the @entity123 family called the police who took statements from both sides , and @entity1 was charged with racially abusing them			2
vindicated : @entity109 and her mother @entity129 leave court after their abuser @entity1 was fined nearly £ 700 and ordered to pay costs she denied his account , telling yesterday 's trial : ' i would never dream of using language like that			2
' her solicitor , @entity137 , suggested in cross-examination that mr @entity62 had made up his account to discredit local residents opposed to the camp , pointing out he had told police : ' if we can stop one of them , it may have the desired effect on the others '			0
however the father - of - three insisted @entity1 had ' lost it ' during the incident in april and caused him and his father - in - law distress			0
deputy district judge @entity151 said he found it ' improbable ' that @entity1 would n't have simply driven off had she felt as intimidated as she claimed , describing the evidence given by mr @entity62 and his family as ' cogent and believable '			2
he told her he was convinced that ' in the heat of the moment you have lost your temper and used the language described in court today '			2
finding her guilty of using racially aggravated threatening words or behaviour , he fined her £ 690 and ordered to pay her £ 620 prosecution costs plus a £ 69 victims ' surcharge			0
@entity168 , of @entity169 , said she hoped to lodge an appeal			0
' i 'm absolutely stunned but i 'm considering the way forward - it 's taken a lot out of me , ' she said			0
' i know perfectly well that i 'm innocent			0
' @entity56 council has set aside £ 145,000 in a vain battle to evict the @entity176 since they moved onto the plot in 2009 , provoking anger towards the family from some local residents			1
they refused to move despite being denied planning permission and being served with an enforcement order , but were recently given a two - year reprieve after successfully arguing there was n't enough provision for travellers in the area			0
wheelchair - bound @entity189 , 78 , arrives at @entity190 ahead of the trial			0
