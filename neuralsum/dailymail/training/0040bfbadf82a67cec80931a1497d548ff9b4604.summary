by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 20:08 est , 4 october 2013 questions : prince @entity2 ended trip with a visit to @entity5 in @entity6 prince @entity2 ’s continued royal globe - trotting is expected to come under fresh scrutiny as he returns from a three - week , 21,258 - mile ‘ official ’ trip			1
the queen ’s son , who was forced to give up his formal role as a @entity14 trade ambassador after a string of scandals , has visited @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity6			0
the trip came just weeks after a separate trip to @entity23 , another of his favourite destinations			2
the first leg of his tour of the @entity31 was funded in full by taxpayers , @entity27 admitted last night			2
a one - way - business class ticket would cost at least £ 5,000			0
in both @entity39 and @entity6 his expenses – including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of ‘ @entity45 ’ , the @entity34 has learnt			1
founded in 1831 by the @entity46 , the @entity47 is a respected independent , not - for - profit research body offering expert opinion on defence , security and terrorism			1
but questions are sure to be asked as to how @entity2 can reconcile his royal role and duties with representing an organisation , however independent , that is funded by private individuals , governments and corporations which include defence manufacturers			1
@entity2 flew out of the @entity14 – accompanied by a team of round - the - clock , publicly - funded police bodyguards – on september 16 to @entity64 , where he stayed for three days			1
the visit was , apparently , designed to promote ‘ @entity14 bilateral relations including in trade and investment , science and innovation as well as education ’			0
he attended a dinner at the @entity73 , opened the new @entity14 embassy and attended a launch of a government - backed tourism initiative			0
details of the trip were not released until after his arrival , however , as @entity2 is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise his foreign travel in advance			1
@entity27 officials confirmed last night that this leg of his journey was approved by the @entity87 at the request of the @entity89 , which means that all his travel costs , hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the @entity11 ’s @entity95			2
one - way business class flights to @entity64 are just under £ 5,000			0
his last official engagement was on the evening of september 19 , after which @entity2 disappeared for a three - day weekend			1
scrutiny : the prince is the only member of the @entity101 who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance @entity27 said only that he spent the time ‘ privately ’			2
he then reappeared in the @entity18 capital @entity105 on september 23 for a two - day stay			0
most notable in a series of engagements , was a high - level @entity47 conference discussing @entity14 - @entity18 defence co-operation and strategic issues in @entity113			1
palace officials say the prince covered the cost of this part of his trip personally			1
his final engagement was on september 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again for five days			0
again , palace officials have declined to discuss his movements			0
@entity2 then turned up in @entity39 on monday this week for another public , yet privately - funded , series of engagements			1
the main thrust of the prince ’s visit was to attend a @entity47 conference on @entity14 - @entity20 security co-operation , where he shared the stage with sir @entity134 , former director of the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , and @entity20 premier , @entity138			1
@entity20 is looking to spend billions on its defence as tensions rise with @entity141 and pressure comes from the @entity143 for the country to become more pro-active globally			0
as a result huge defence contracts are up for grabs			0
according to well - placed sources , the prince also took the opportunity to spend some time privately with the @entity20 royal family			0
after initially refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there , @entity27 eventually admitted – after being challenged by the @entity34 – that @entity47 had ‘ made a proportionate contribution towards his costs ’			1
the think - tank also funded him to fly on to @entity6 on wednesday this week , ostensibly to take part in further high - level discussions on its behalf			1
his arrival in @entity164 coincided with that of his youngest daughter , @entity5 , who moved to the city to work for a year for an online auction company			0
@entity2 took @entity5 , 23 , out for dinner on wednesday night at @entity170			1
@entity27 have refused to say when the prince is returning to the @entity14			0
a spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘ great admirer of the @entity47 ’s work ’			1
sources stressed @entity2 did not receive a salary as a member of its @entity179 and pointed out it ‘ already has well - established links with the @entity101 , in the form of the @entity11 , who is its patron , and the @entity183 , its president ’			2
they also claimed that the prince – nicknamed @entity186 for his love of travel – was taking scheduled flights throughout his trip			2
a spokesman for @entity47 said they had been keen to invite @entity2 to join their advisory board as he ‘ endorsed and consolidated @entity47 ’s status as a leading independent international think tank ’			1
however the latest revelations will , once again , shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities			0
in 2001 he became the @entity14 ’s @entity199			0
but he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers ’ money			0
the final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with @entity206 , a @entity143 financier who has been jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls			0
in july 2011 @entity2 announced he was standing down			2
@entity210 of the @entity211 ’ @entity209 , said : ‘ taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the @entity214 ’s gallivanting across the globe , given that he is no longer a @entity14 trade envoy			2
it is imperative that the @entity214 is open and transparent about exactly how he has spent taxpayers ’ cash			2

think tank @entity47 subsidised @entity214 *'s* expenses
the body has appointed prince @entity2 to its board of advisors
he was accompanied on his trip by his publicly funded security team
