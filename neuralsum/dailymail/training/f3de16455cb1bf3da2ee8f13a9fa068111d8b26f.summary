by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor day after day this week @entity3 ’s @entity4 has endured accusations of fakery and racism ... and yesterday even more gaffes continued to surface			2
it emerged that a ‘ @entity14 builder ’ featuring in a poster complaining about cheap foreign labour was in fact an @entity12 actor			1
and there was further embarrassment after a senior @entity4 party manager posted an advertisement in his local newspaper suggesting @entity22 take multiple wives so they could get extra benefits			2
it has spent days defending itself against a barrage of complaints that its posters were ‘ racist ’ and that a ‘ voter ’ featured in the ads was in fact a @entity3 aide , @entity48			1
then yesterday it emerged that one of the poster stars , who appeared to be a @entity14 builder ‘ hit hard by unlimited cheap labour ’ , was actually an @entity12 actor , @entity56			1
in his profile on the acting website @entity58 , mr @entity56 said he could speak in several accents including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			2

the award - winning @entity71 - based advertising agency @entity70 - which has worked for the @entity73 , @entity74 and the @entity75 - helped produce the campaign funded by @entity79 donor @entity77			1
but critics branded the slogans ' racist ' , even before revelations about the people in the poster and tv adverts plunged the party into turmoil			1
builder in tv advert posts racist @entity91 decorator @entity90 posed in a builder 's hard hat to complain that ‘ lads from @entity95 ’ were undercutting him			1
but on @entity96 he posted a series of offensive comments , claiming @entity99 is ‘ not @entity14 ’ , condemned @entity100 as ‘ evil ’ , branding the @entity101 a paedophile and saying he wanted @entity103 to ‘ kill themselves off ’			1
@entity4 response : @entity3 : ' @entity105 was the word we used , and i will stick with that			2
we have put in place a vetting procedure and something has gone wrong			2
' @entity48 appears in a full - page photograph as a voter from @entity115 , but is actually @entity4 ’s events manager and an assistant to the party leader			2
@entity4 response : @entity3 : ' the fact that @entity120 is half - @entity121 and works for us is as far as we are concerned a non-issue			2
' eye - catching poster shows a builder begging on the street with the message : ' @entity132 policy at work			1
@entity14 workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour			2
' but he is @entity28 , an actor from @entity12 who moved to @entity14 10 years ago			1
@entity4 response : director of communications @entity137 : ' the vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors			1
it is totally standard practice			0
' he said : ‘ i ’m originally from @entity146 , living in the @entity14 10 years			1
i ’m currently acting full time and looking to build my portfolio			0
’ his cv includes a part as ' a troubled youth with psychotic tendencies ' in @entity153 , a 2001 @entity12 drama with @entity155 and @entity157 star @entity156			0
he has since taken part in two drama courses in @entity71 and played an @entity161 officer in the 2008 drama @entity163			0
people from @entity12 are able to move freely to the @entity14 under the immigration rules which mr @entity3 is campaigning against			1
to add to the embarrassment , only this week mr @entity3 boasted : ' most parties use actors			0
' it followed the revelation that ' @entity48 from @entity115 ' who featured in the party 's manifesto is actually @entity4 's events manager based in @entity174			1
another row blew up yesterday after @entity176 , a leading party activist in the @entity177 , placed an advert in his local newspaper for his discount store business which offered a ‘ money spinner ’ ‘ for ‘ any cash - strapped @entity100 [ sic ] reading this ’			0
it went on to suggest that men could take a ‘ harem ’ of wives to get an extra £ 33.65 a week in benefits from the @entity187 for each of them			1
he also made sexist comments suggesting women should not go out to work , that they were natural home makers			0
mr @entity176 said he had discussed this issue with his wife @entity198 and that ‘ since the snow came back all she ’s done is look through the window			0
if it gets any worse i ’ll have to let her back in again ’			0
@entity4 leader @entity3 yesterday admitted ' something went wrong ' with the party 's vetting system			2
as @entity4 struggled to get its election campaign back on track , @entity75 mp @entity207 said of the poster using an @entity12 actor to depict a @entity14 builder : ‘ here is another example of @entity4 being cynical and not being straight with the @entity14 voters			1
’ @entity4 director of communications @entity217 said : ‘ the vast majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors			2
it is nonsense for the @entity75 to try and depict this as anything out of the ordinary			0
’ the party defended mr @entity176 ’s comments in his advert , saying there were ‘ quite legitimate concerns about the interaction of the benefits system with men who have multiple wives ’			0
a spokesman added : ‘ mr @entity176 ’s remarks about women in the workplace and his wife were intended as a joke and indeed were understood as such			0
he does not seriously believe women should not work			0
given that his wife works in the same office as he does , it would be curious if he did			0
’ mr @entity176 also made derogatory remarks about @entity247 and @entity248 in a book he published			0
on another front , mr @entity3 last night faced accusations that he was changing his tune on having his expenses audited			0
the @entity4 leader had earlier suggested that he would be happy to have a probe into his allowances as an mep			0
but in an interview with the @entity259 last night , he denied he had ever suggested it			0
‘ i said if every other @entity14 mep wants to , then i would			0
i am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all that is wrong with the @entity132			1
’ @entity265 decorator @entity90 appeared in the @entity4 party political broadcast to complain about the impact of immigration in @entity14 the row is a blow for @entity4 leader @entity3 , who spent the day campaigning in @entity272 in @entity273			1
