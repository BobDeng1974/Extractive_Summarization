a major hunt is underway to find @entity2 's most prolific petrol thief who has been driving off without paying for fuel for two years after escaping detectives by donning fake number plates and wigs			1
officers have linked the thief to 29 separate incidents in @entity11 and @entity12 and said the con - artist has made off with thousands of pounds worth of fuel during the spree			1
however , thanks to an array of disguises including woolly hats , hoodies and wigs , officers have been unable to identify the offender and are n't even certain if they are a man , a woman or a transvestite			1
officers have linked the thief to 29 separate incidents in @entity11 and @entity12 and said the con artist has made off with thousands of pounds worth of fuel during her spree			1
the thief is pictured here wearing a blonde wig police have so far been unable to identify the suspect due to the varying disguises used in each offence			2
officers said the offender has regularly used fake number plates and swaps them before and after the crime @entity11 and @entity40 said witnesses have described the suspect as female in 19 offences , male in seven cases , and ' indistinguishable ' in the remaining three			1
the only firm lead the force has is the silver @entity50 that has been picked up repeatedly on @entity51 despite the fraudster using a variety of cloned plates			0
the scammer 's spree began in september 2012 when the mystery suspect refuelled at an @entity59 garage in @entity60 , @entity11			1
over the following two years , the same offender targeted petrol stations across the @entity63 including at @entity64 , @entity59 and @entity65 and each time made off with between £ 55 and £ 85 of free fuel			2
police said the suspect is most likely a woman , but said they ca n't rule out a male transvestite either			2
detective constable @entity71 , who is leading the investigation , said : ' the most frequent report is of a woman , sometimes in long blonde wig , or a short bob - cut wig , or wearing a beanie hat or hoody			0
in some cases the suspect dons a wig , while in others they put on a beanie hat or shield their face with a hoody police have released cctv of the offender in the hope of identifying the thief who started the spree in 2012 ' but while the same car has been reported at each of the 29 incidents on a few occasions the victim says they think the driver was a man			1
' we 're keeping an open mind and seeing as this woman appears to go to great lengths to disguise herself , it may well be her impersonating a man			0
' what is very clear is over the past two or more years , this woman has stolen thousands of pounds worth of fuel			1
' it 's quite possible she has n't paid a penny for her fuel in the last couple of years			2
' she 's very brazen about it , sometimes returning to the same location two or three times within a few months			0
@entity40 said 29 incidents have been reported , with 19 witnesses describing the thief as a woman , seven describing them as a man and three suggesting the sex is ' indistinguishable ' in each theft , police said the thief takes between £ 55 and £ 85 worth of fuel before driving off without paying ' these thefts are not spur of the moment			1
we know she is going prepared , with a set of disguises which she carries with her in the car			0
' we also know she is using cloned number plates , which we believe she is changing shortly before and after each of these thefts			0
police have now released these cctv images of the suspect in the hope someone will be able to help police in identifying them			0
@entity143 added : ' someone out there knows this woman			0
she may be boasting about her actions , or they have seen her disguises in a car matching the silver @entity50			0
' she clearly has no intention of paying for her fuel , seeing it as something only other people have to do			0
' police have managed to link each of the 29 offences due to the car - a @entity50 - being used by the thief the thief started the spree in @entity60 , @entity11 , and has since targeted petrol stations across the @entity63			2
