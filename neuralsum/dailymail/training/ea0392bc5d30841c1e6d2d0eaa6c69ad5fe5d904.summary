while small studio flats are nothing new in @entity1 , the rise of ' semi studios ' has seen renters in the capital move into ' rabbit hutch properties ' that are barely bigger than the legal minimum			1
tiny bedsits on the market for up to £ 1,040 a month are becoming more common as landlords divide up larger houses and flats to take advantage of the @entity1 's booming housing market			1
letting agents have dubbed these ' semi studios ' , and some are being let for nearly twice the average rent for a one bed flat			0
this £ 1,040 - a - month ' semi studio ' flat in @entity22 has a ladder to climb to its mezzanine - style bed @entity26 's housing spokesman on the @entity27 said renters were living in ' rabbit hutch properties ' letting agents price this studio flat at £ 115 a person a week , but this bedroom is unlikely to fit more than one by law , a studio flat has to be at least 70 sq ft to house one tenant , while two adults have to be afforded 110 sq ft of living space			1
some of these minuscule studios have such little space that they share toilets with their neighbours , but they are still described as ' charming and compact ' by letting agents			0
the most expensive of these flats , in @entity22 , costs £ 1,040 a month , but it 's ' mezzanine - style ' bed means its future tenant will have to climb a ladder to go to bed			2
the bed is so close to the ceiling that they will have to crawl on the bed to get under the sheets			0
another of these flats , a £ 540 - a - month bedsit in @entity62 , central @entity1 , is described as ' delightful ' but with a ' compact ' work space by letting agents			1
its ' very own shower room ' is actually a cubicle squeezed in between a table and the kitchen worktop , standing about 3ft from the studio 's single bed			0
a further semi studio , in @entity22 , will set its tenant back almost £ 500 a month , despite not having its own toilet and having a shower cubicle crammed between a wardrobe and a window			1
@entity77 , @entity26 's housing spokesman on the @entity27 , told the @entity79 that @entity80 were increasingly being forced to pay ' extortionate rents for poor quality , rabbit hutch properties '			2
he added : ' the home is at the centre of most people 's lives , so the impact on quality of life is enormous			0
people ought to be able to expect a decent place to live for a reasonable rent			0
' property website @entity94 say the average the one - bedroom property in @entity1 sets renters back £ 377 a week , while four - bedroom homes are advertised for an average £ 1,085 a week			2
this flat costs £ 477 per calendar month , but at least it comes with a toilet - unlike many semi studios showering with guests round , if they can fit any , will not be a comfortable experience for the future tenant of this ' delightful ' semi studio in @entity62 , near @entity108 this single bed semi studio , on @entity110 in @entity22 , will set a tenant back £ 498 a month this means landlords can make hundreds of pounds more in rent every week by dividing up family homes into the small studios			1
@entity117 , a buy - to - let mortgage lender , said recently that landlords could make up to £ 38,000 in annual rental income by splitting a family home into flats , compared to around £ 18,000 if they did not			1
@entity123 , director of communications , policy and campaigns at @entity126 , said : ' the fact that @entity1 's renters are stuck with these pitiful pint - sized properties is a reflection of the appalling state of our private rented sector			2
' @entity135 rents and tough competition for homes in the capital means that many renters have no choice but to take the first place they can afford , and are being squeezed into costly , cramped and claustrophobic flats that are far too small for them and their families			0
' this plain bedroom , labelled ' charming ' by letting agents , costs £ 460 a month and does not have its own toilet this narrow single - bed studio costs £ 480 a month , but is just a short walk from @entity151			0
