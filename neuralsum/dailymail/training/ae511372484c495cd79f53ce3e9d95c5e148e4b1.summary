by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 17:11 est , 19 december 2012 a huge aquatic lizard has been discovered that terrorised @entity4 rivers 84 million years ago			1
the new species was discovered in @entity6 is the first known example of a group of scaled reptiles to have lived in freshwater river environments			1
they were the biggest and most dangerous predators in the water and occupied a similar niche to freshwater dolphins of today			2
mosasaurs were terrifying aquatic predators which evolved to live in both the seas and freshwater rivers			2
researchers believe the largest of the ancient lizards grew up to 20 feet ( 6m ) long , though most would have been 10 - 13 feet ( 3 - 4m )			0
the new species was named @entity23 by the scientists who discovered it			1
armed with rows of sharp teeth they would have siezed and eaten anything they could get into their mouths			0
it belonged to the mosasaur family which most fossil remains have show to be monstrous sea creatures			0
but the fossil remains from @entity6 are believed by scientists to have come from a freshwater predator that shared its tropical environment with crocodiles			2
fossil remains of the newly discovered creature represent a range of individuals , ranging from small juveniles to large adults			1
they had limbs like a terrestrial lizard , a flattened , crocodile - like skull , and a tail unlike other known members of the mosasaur family			0
the fossils were recovered from an open - pit mine in the @entity57 which were once flood - plains			0
some of the fossilised bones were so little weathered that the animal they belonged to is believed to have been washed away in a sudden flood and rapidly buried			0
according to the study , this is the first known mosasaur that lived in freshwater and only the second to have been found in rocks that were not once deposited in the ocean			0
researchers pieced together a haul of fossils from an ancient @entity6 flood plain to reveal @entity23 @entity74 , of the @entity75 who conducted the study with colleagues from the @entity79 in @entity80 , said the ancient lizard family evolved to adapt to several different freshwater environments			1
' the evidence we provide here makes it clear that similar to some lineages of cetaceans , mosasaurs quickly adapted to a variety of aquatic environments , with some groups re-invading available niches in freshwater habitats , ' he said			0
' the size of @entity23 makes it the largest known predator in the waters of this paleo - environment			1
' the @entity6 and @entity80 research team added in their report , published in the journal @entity102 : ' we consider the crocodile - like flattened skull to be a useful adaptation for water - level ambush hunting of terrestrial and shallow water prey			1

newly discovered reptile lurked just *beneath* the surface to ambush prey
@entity23 was a top predator 84 million years ago
