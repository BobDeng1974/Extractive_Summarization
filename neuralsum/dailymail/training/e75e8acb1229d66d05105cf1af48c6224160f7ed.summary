by @entity0 foreign doctors who want to work in the @entity3 should be required to get better exam results to ensure patient safety , researchers are urging			1
to practise in the @entity3 , doctors currently have to pass exams testing their medical knowledge and @entity10 language skills			1
but the study concluded that the pass mark is set too low – and insisted that foreign doctors who pass are not up to the same standard as newly - trained doctors in @entity3			1
researchers claim foreign doctors who pass are not up to the same standard as newly - trained doctors in @entity3 ( file picture ) researchers at @entity19 and the @entity20 found the international graduates got substantially lower marks in exams for would - be gps and physicians			1
foreign doctors must pass an @entity10 language test and the @entity30 's @entity29 ( @entity28 ) test , designed to ensure that overseas doctors demonstrate the same level of medical knowledge and clinical skills as @entity3 graduates who have completed their first foundation training year			1
the researchers compared the results of these two tests to the performance of @entity3 graduates taking exams set by the royal colleges of physicians and the @entity43			1
they said that raising the exam pass mark ' considerably ' – by up to 20 per cent – would ensure both sets of doctors were of a similar standard			1
but they also warned this would cut the pass rate and could cause a shortage of candidates for the @entity53 , which is heavily reliant on foreign medical staff			2
to practise in the @entity3 , doctors currently have to pass exams testing their medical knowledge and @entity10 language skills ( file picture ) the number of patients on @entity53 waiting lists is at its highest for nearly six years			1
there are now 2.89million awaiting surgery or other hospital procedures , including nearly 550 who have been waiting for more than a year			0
official figures also show that , for the first time since march 2011 , the @entity53 has missed a crucial target that patients should be treated within 18 weeks			0
the health service is meant to ensure that at least 90 per cent are treated within this time but the figure fell to 89.9 per cent in february , meaning that around 400 waited longer			0
@entity72 warned that the @entity53 was heading back to the ' bad old days ' when hundreds of thousands of patients waited up to two years for treatment			0
its health spokesman , @entity74 , said : ' under @entity77 , waiting lists for operations are at their longest in years			0
' around one in three doctors registered with the @entity30 qualified in other countries , with 27 per cent obtaining their medical degree from outside the @entity81			1
concerns over the abilities of foreign - trained doctors were brought to the fore by the death of 70 - year - old retired engineer @entity87 in 2008			2
he was given ten times the normal dose of diamorphine by @entity92 locum dr @entity91			0
@entity94 - born dr @entity91 had snatched just a few hours of sleep after flying in from @entity92 to work his first shift for a private out - of - hours firm			0
writing on the medical website bmj.com , the researchers said the move could create ' severe workforce planning challenges ' for the @entity53			2
but they insisted that raising the standard of the exam was ' fundamental to ensuring the quality of postgraduate medical education and training , the delivery of medical care of the highest quality , and thus ensuring patient safety in the @entity53 '			2
in a separate study , @entity112 researchers compared postgraduate performance between international and @entity3 medical graduates – and found that the @entity3 graduates did better in later exams			1
dr @entity118 , a senior lecturer @entity118 's @entity119 , said : ' further research is needed to understand the potential reasons for these differences in performance , and in particular , the possible role that language and culture may play			0
' he added : ' there may be better ways of supporting overseas doctors to adjust to @entity3 culture , and that of the health service more quickly			2
' professor @entity133 , co-director of the @entity134 at @entity112 , said : ' it is important to appreciate that from patients ' points of view , cultural differences are not absolutes			0
' for instance , a doctor from a particular cultural background may be able to provide particularly valuable care to patients from the same background			0
