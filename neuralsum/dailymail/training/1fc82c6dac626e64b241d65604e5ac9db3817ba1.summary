@entity8 was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis – a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves			1
the condition can also cause bone problems , pressure on the spinal nerves , severe pain , learning disabilities and vision and hearing problems			0

the tumours will not grow back on her new face as it has different genes fresh start : dr @entity41 , who led @entity8 's 23 - hour surgery last week , said he hopes the transplant of 80 per cent of the skin on her face will give her the ability to chew , talk or swallow @entity8 had 23 - hours of surgery to give her a new face			1
during the operation , 80 per cent of the skin on her face was replaced @entity8 ( pictured during surgery last week ) was severely deformed by neurofibromatosis - a genetic condition that causes benign tumours to grow along the nerves despite their alarming appearance , the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious			1
the facial tumour will not recur because the skin on her new face is from different genes , genetics expert dr @entity109 told @entity113			1
in may , dr @entity41 and his colleagues performed @entity3 's first face transplant on a man whose face was torn off by a stone mason 's machine			0
his recovery is said to be progressing			0
the man 's operation took 27 hours and was carried out just weeks after his accident			0
it was thought to be the first face transplant to be carried out so soon after the damage had occurred - previous transplants have taken months , or even years , to prepare			0
@entity8 is currently in serious but stable condition after the operation at the @entity130 and @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity3			1

@entity144 had blown most of his face off with a gun during a hunting accident and was left unable to breathe , swallow or talk properly .			2

@entity8 , 26 , struggled to chew , swallow or talk before the *massive* operation
it took 23 hours and involved replacing 80 per cent of the skin on her face
she suffered from neurofibromatosis - a genetic condition causing tumours
the tumour will not grow back because skin on new face has different genes
