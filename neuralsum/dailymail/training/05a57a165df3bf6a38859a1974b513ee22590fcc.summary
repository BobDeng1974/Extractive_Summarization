the @entity9 , built by @entity11 - based robotics firm @entity10 , have previously served in the war in @entity13 and are described as ' multi-mission , battle - tested ' robots			1
they are set to be used during the construction of @entity19 stadiums to help clear routes and hunt for explosives			0
the robots can clear routes , find hazardous material and carry out other reconnaisance missions across the country the @entity31 travels at up to 5.8 miles per hour and can be fitted with sensors that detect hazardous materials			2
a thermal camera can also be fitted to the @entity36 's chassis after winning the government contracts , @entity37 , senior vice president and general manager of @entity23 ’s @entity10 said : ' @entity23 continues its international expansion , and @entity3 represents an important market for the company ’s unmanned ground vehicles			1
' @entity23 is excited to be providing the company ’s state - of - the - art robotic technologies to @entity3 as the country prepares for several high profile international events , including the 2014 @entity50			1
' the £ 4.2 million contract also includes robot spares and associated equipment			0
the company has delivered more than 5,000 robots to military and civil missions worldwide			0
its mobile robots have performed multiple missions for troops and public safety officers			0

the robots bought by the @entity3 government are the @entity106 packbot models and they have been hired until december 2013			1
they are reminiscent of the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) robots from the 1987 film robocop in the kind of missions they carry out			0
the @entity23 are battery powered and can climb stairs and slopes of up to a 60 - degree angle			1
they can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour , and continue to be fully operation in water up to three - feet deep			0
packbots are waterproof and can work in all weather conditions			0
@entity123 including the 310 and the @entity124 have been sent to war zones , including @entity13 , to help soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions			1
the robots can go into dangerous situations and collect data for troops			0
the @entity23 can be fitted with @entity133 mapping technology , which means it can retrace its steps if communications are disrupted @entity136 can be used to clear routes and get rid of debris including gun shells and unexploded bombs			1
it uses sensors and built - in cameras to find the objects and can be fitted with small arms that can collect the items and move them out of the way @entity148 starred in the 1987 film robocop in which officials in @entity151 hire robots to police to the state depending on the mission , @entity23 can be fitted with various payloads			1
they can be fitted with sensors and tools including small arms to help carry and move items , explosive detection kits , a thermal camera , and cable cutters			0
if the @entity36 is flipped over , it can also automatically right itself			2
if communication to the @entity36 is cut off , the robot will retrace its steps to find its mission team			2
the @entity170 models of the @entity36 are semi-autonomous , which means they can travel and make decisions by themselves			2
it can automatically avoid bumps , debris and other obstacles and it uses gps mapping to navigate around a mission area			0
the 510 @entity23 can climb up and down stairs and have a built - in inclinometer to help it navigate up slopes			1
it can travel up to 5.8 miles per hour up a slope of 60 degrees video : the @entity36 in action			2

@entity23 has won contracts to provide @entity3 with 510 @entity36 battle - tested robots
the @entity23 have previously helped soldiers *fighting* in @entity13 and have been brought in to prepare @entity3 for the @entity8 in 2016
