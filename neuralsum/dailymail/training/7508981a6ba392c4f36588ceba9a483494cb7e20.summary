posing on the telephone as a recruiter called ' @entity30 ' , @entity1 told the woman that he had the power to offer her work in local pubs , hotels or a strip club that he was working for			1
impressed by his claims she agreed to meet him at a hotel for an ' interview ' , to which he turned up under the guise of @entity30 's boss , @entity42			2
' you told lie upon lie ... [ creating ] an impression that you were interviewing her and other people for employment , ' said the judge			1
' you sounded her out , i am quite sure , to see if she was willing to undertake a role that might have a sexual element to it			2
' this was an elaborate ploy			2
it was not a last - minute thought			2
you had seen her advert looking for work the day before and you set about luring her to the hotel and then to your home			1
' satisfied with the first ' interview ' , @entity1 called the woman again to arrange a second one in october last year			1
he picked her up in his car and told her he had to pass his home to make some phone calls			2

i got a bit scared then			0
he asked me if i would try this stuff on and i said no. ' i said i did n’t feel comfortable and i was a bit scared and wary			0
he asked me how he could make me feel more comfortable			0
i said , " you ca n’t "			0
' he then approached me and he went in for a kiss			0
i turned my head but he leaned in and kissed me			0
i did n’t know what to do with myself			0
' he realised i was not going to give him a kiss and then it changed			0

' @entity1 admitted falsely imprisoning the woman in his home but denied kidnapping her with sexual intent			1
his pleas were accepted by the prosecution			0
but because @entity1 denied the woman ’s claim that he tried to kiss and seduce her , a ‘ trial of issue ’ was held for judge @entity22 to decide which version of the facts he believed			1
after hearing from the woman and from @entity1 , the judge said he accepted everything that she said and found that @entity1 had been ‘ lying through his teeth from start to finish			1

' this was a very unusual offence , ' said the barrister			0
' it was in a period of his life when he was experiencing a series of problems in his life and depression			0
' although what he did was elaborate it was very unsophisicated			0

@entity1 , 38 , promised woman , 21 , he could offer work in bars or clubs
he created fake personalities to lure her to interview
after taking her to his home he told her to look through a bag of racy underwear and try some on
when she *refused* he told her she had passed the test and got the job
judge : ' you lied through your teeth from start to finish '
