a fisherman from @entity1 was left baffled when he caught this see - through shrimp - like creature swimming near the surface of the ocean			2
@entity6 was fishing with sons @entity7 and @entity9 43 miles north off the @entity11 's @entity10 when he spotted the translucent ' shrimp ' floating near the top of the water			1
mr @entity6 said : ' i was in two minds whether to haul it in , but curiosity got the better of me and i decided to take a closer look			1
this translucent shrimp - like creature was caught swimming near the surface of the ocean off @entity1 baffled : fisherman @entity6 holding the see - through shrimp ' it felt scaly and was quite firm , almost jelly like , and you could n't see anything inside aside from this orange little blob inside it			1
the photo baffled mr @entity6 and all of his fisherman friends , who are still none more the wise as to what the creature could have been			1
one theory to explain the mysterious fish is that it could be a salpa maggiore - a kind of marine invertebrate			2
@entity40 , as they are more commonly known , are found in both equatorial and cold seas , so the waters around @entity1 's @entity10 would be more than suitable for the translucent sea creature			1
they are spotted swimming alone just as often as they are seen in long , string - like colonies , and move by pumping water through their gelatinous bodies			2
as a harmless creature that feeds only on plankton , a salp 's see - through body is believed to be designed to avoid it being spotted by predators when floating near the surface			0
one remarkable species survival technique is the ability to create a clone of itself when food is abundant , which then grow at the fastest rate of any multicellular creature			0
mr @entity6 said : ' we have no idea what it could have been but it was quite something and i 'd never seen anything like it before			1
' however , @entity69 , research lead from the @entity71 in @entity72 , told @entity73 she believes the creature is a @entity40 ( @entity40 maxima )			2
@entity76 , director of conservation and communication at the @entity71 , said : ' @entity79 is known about these salps , however , they are often found in colder seas , with the most abundant concentration found in the @entity84			0
' the salp is barrel - shaped and moves by contracting , pumping water through its gelatinous body			0
' it strains the water through its internal feeding filters , feeding on phytoplankton from the upper sunlit layer of the ocean			0
' they have an interesting life - cycle with alternate generations existing as solitary individuals or groups forming long chains			0
' in common with other defenceless animals that occupy open water - jellies and hydroids for example - the translucence presumably provides some protection from predation			0
being see - through is a pretty good camouflage in water			0
' mr @entity6 , was fishing with sons @entity7 and @entity9 70kms north of the @entity10 when he spotted the mysterious shrimp			1

@entity6 was fishing 43 miles north off the @entity10
he *plucked* the *bizarre* creature from the water and took a photo
it has baffled mr @entity6 and all of his fisherman friends
but *aquarium* tells @entity73 the creature is called a @entity40 maggiore
