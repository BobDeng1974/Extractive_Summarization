@entity1 ’s first minister @entity0 said @entity2 elected in may would back @entity4 ’s bid to repeal the government ’s @entity6 reforms @entity9 mps will vote on laws which only apply in @entity11 , @entity0 has revealed			1
@entity1 ’s first minister said @entity2 elected in may would back @entity4 ’s bid to repeal the government ’s @entity6 reforms , even though @entity14 is in complete control of the health service north of the border			1
the revelation , which sparked fury among @entity8 in @entity20 , comes after @entity21 revealed that the government would bail out @entity1 ’s ailing oil industry following demands for @entity20 support in the wake of collapsing global prices			1
it will fuel further calls for a ban on @entity1 mps voting on @entity11 - only laws			1
@entity34 minister @entity33 said @entity35 was putting the @entity36 at risk again			0
' i 'm absolutely astonished at the complete twaddle she has just spoken , ' she told the @entity40			0
' she does n't even understand what 's happened and this nonsense - and it is a nonsense - that the @entity43 are on some wide - scale privatisation of the @entity6			2
she puts our @entity36 at risk again and plays with dangerous stuff			0
' @entity34 mp @entity48 said the @entity9 was changing its position on @entity11 votes for @entity11 laws so it could enter into an agreement with @entity4 after the election			1
he said : ' this is a piece of political opportunism by the @entity9 because she wants to reassure the @entity57 that if they fall short , if she wins a lot of seats , they might be able to stitch up a deal together			0
' obviously i want the @entity43 to win and hope this does n’t arise but i think you have to see it in terms of positioning with the @entity9 riding a lot higher in the polls getting the idea that they might get their hands on the levers of power for the @entity74 as a whole			0
' but ms @entity0 insisted any vote on the @entity6 had knock - on effects in @entity1 because the @entity80 government ’s budget is linked to @entity20 spending			1
she said it was necessary to protect the @entity1 nhs from the knock on effects of cuts and privatisation in @entity11			1
the @entity9 leader told the @entity40 : ‘ we would be prepared to vote on matters of @entity11 health because that has a direct impact on @entity1 's budget			1
‘ so if there was a vote in the @entity96 to repeal the privatisation of the health service as has been seen in @entity11 to restore the @entity6 we would vote for that because that would help to protect @entity1 's budget			1
‘ if there are decisions taken to further privatise the @entity6 in @entity11 , and i do n't think anybody thinks the @entity34 are progressively privatising the health service in order to increase the public funding of the health service , so decisions are taken , that reduce over time the public funding of the health service in @entity11 then that has a direct knock on effect to @entity1 's budget			1
’ meanwhile , an @entity113 poll for @entity114 has found 52 per cent of @entity1 are planning to vote @entity9 in may			1
this is the same as in october last year , while support for @entity4 has increased by one point to 24 per cent			2
that would give the @entity119 an incredible 55 of @entity1 's 59 seats , with @entity4 reduced to a rump of only four @entity2 - with the @entity34 and the @entity122 completely wiped out			1
@entity4 leader @entity123 insisted his party ' is changing ' and urged voters to leave referendum divisions in the past			2
@entity21 has said an english - votes - for - english - laws rule would ‘ have to apply on areas connected with the budget ’ despite ms @entity0 ’s claim , spending on the @entity6 has gone up faster than the @entity133 in recent years			1
between 2009 - 10 and 2015 - 16 @entity133 cut spending by around 1 per cent - while the health budget in @entity11 increased by 4 per cent			2
the revelation comes ahead of draft legislation on the devolution of extra powers to @entity14 set to be published on thursday			0
appearing before mps earlier this week , @entity21 said the sweeping new spending powers reinforced the case for restrictions on the voting powers of @entity1 mps			2
he said an english - votes - for - english - laws rule would ‘ have to apply on areas connected with the budget ’			0
in a message aimed at @entity149 , who could find himself in no 11 @entity150 after the election as part of a @entity4 government relying on the support of smaller parties such as the @entity9 , mr @entity21 also said the chancellor after the next election should not be ‘ beholden on @entity1 nationalist votes ’			1
@entity159 , at @entity160 , has vowed to introduce @entity11 votes for @entity11 laws labour leader @entity163 has rejected mr @entity159 's proposal to ban @entity1 mps voting on @entity11 - only laws once powers to set income tax have been devolved , @entity1 would have to ‘ live with the consequences ’ of its decisions - including if wealthy individuals flee across the border to escape ‘ punitive ’ rates , mr @entity21 told the @entity174			1
mr @entity21 said proposals for ‘ @entity11 votes for @entity11 laws ’ would be published before the general election , but he insisted that it must be the case that @entity1 mps should have their ability to vote on aspects of future budgets curbed if powers have been devolved			1
the cross-party @entity182 on devolution said the @entity1 mps should continue to vote on the @entity74 's @entity146 , including income tax			1
many aspects of the system would remain @entity74 - wide , mr @entity21 said , including the definition of income and the system of reliefs , so mps from @entity1 constituencies would be able to vote on those			1
the @entity194 has revealed that an independent @entity1 could have been up to £ 7billion worse off as a result of falling oil revenue			2
mr @entity21 lambasted predictions made by the @entity9 during the referendum campaign about the finances @entity201 oil would generate for the nation as ‘ wildly optimistic ’			2
he told the commons treasury select committee : ‘ i took decisions in the @entity205 to reduce taxes on @entity201 oil , anticipating the pressures that the falling oil price would have on the industry and i 'm sure we are going to have to take further steps at the @entity146			0
‘ but we can only do that because we are @entity74 and we pool our risks			0
’ the collapse in the price of oil would mean an independent @entity1 would now be sacking doctors , nurses and teachers , @entity215 claimed			2
the chief secretary to the treasury said @entity1 had ' dodged a bullet ' by rejecting independence in last year 's referendum			0
the @entity1 government is now demanding tax cuts to bailout the oil industry , just four months after claiming that booming @entity201 reserves would bankroll independence			2
the oil industry has been plunged into crisis after the price of a barrel of @entity236 halved since june to around $ 48 the price of a barrel of @entity236 – the global benchmark – has more than halved since june to around $ 48 ( £ 31.50 )			0
experts predict it could fall as low as $ 31 ( £ 20.44 ) by april			0
mr @entity215 said : ' talk about @entity1 having dodged a bullet			0
if we had been independent we would n't just be worrying about a very serious situation in the @entity201 , the @entity1 government would be working out how many nurses and doctors and teachers it would have to make redundant because it would have run out of money for a lot of those things			2
' if we were independent right now the effect on @entity1 's finances would be utterly catastrophic			0
last summer @entity20 parties were accused of scaremongering by the @entity9 for warning an independent @entity1 would be vulnerable to a drop in oil prices			1
' as it turns out the things that we said were rather mild compared to what actually happened			0
' there 's still a lot of oil and gas there , we want to make sure we get it out			0
that 's what i 've always wanted			0
' but it 's only because of the strength and stability of the @entity74 that we have the ability to make those decisions rather than an independent @entity1 which would n't just be beset by serious problems in the @entity201 but by a fiscal crisis as well			0
' because we are part of the @entity74 we do n't have to confront that			0
' he warned the situation facing the oil and gas sector is ' serious ' and further help will be offered in the @entity146 in march			0

@entity9 mps will vote on laws which only affect @entity11 , @entity0 said
the party will back @entity4 ’s bid to repeal the government ’s @entity6 reforms
@entity14 is in complete control of the health service north of the border
comes after the @entity9 demanded @entity20 support for @entity1 oil
