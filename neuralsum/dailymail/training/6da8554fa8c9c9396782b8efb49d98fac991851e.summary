@entity0 promised a new - look @entity1 upon his return from injury			1
a stronger , bulked - up , better than he was before , @entity1			2
a knee problem has kept him out since october - a terrible shame given he was just getting started in a vital campaign that could have restarted his career			1
in truth , @entity1 has not been as good for @entity9 as most expected he would be			1
Â£ 42.5million is a lot of money , and for that you would expect more world - class performances than he has given to date			0
@entity1 fires the ball past @entity16 and into the back of the net for his first goal since returning to @entity9 @entity1 ( right ) is congratulated by his team - mates after firing @entity9 into a 2 - 0 lead at the @entity22 but here is another opportunity to shine			1
his first start for the @entity26 since october 5 , a chance to show his best qualities against opposition from the league below			2
@entity31 , all told , are not a bad side			0
not as good as they were two seasons ago though , and @entity9 should have been able to flex their muscles with relative ease			1
it could n't have started much better for @entity0 's side in this @entity41 fifth round match			1
two minutes in , @entity42 to @entity43			0
sunday was only the sixth time that @entity43 and @entity1 have started together for @entity9			1
it 's surely a combination that @entity0 will have longed for , but various injuries have meant that while one is fit , the other is laying on a treatment table in @entity50			2
@entity1 watches on as his perfectly - placed effort flies past the outstretched arm of @entity53 @entity1 impressed on his first start since october 5 , but he must now take that form into the @entity56 as @entity9 began to really impose themselves on the game , so too did @entity1			1
aside from a cameo appearance against @entity59 earlier this month , these were his first real minutes of 2015			0
@entity1 was given a free rein to drift around the midfield			2
technically wide on the team - sheet , but in reality able to come and go as he pleased			0
and that works for him			0
if you pigeon - hole him , he runs the risk of being ineffective			0
@entity0 has been honest in his assessment of @entity1 's positioning , admitting that the @entity70 does n't enjoy being sent to hug the touchline			1
and so , his overriding moment in this game came from him drifting in and sitting on @entity31 's back four			2
@entity74 played the ball through ; an eye - of - the - needle , perfectly - weighted knock			1
a touch with his left foot , a touch with his right foot , and then a shot into the bottom corner of the net from @entity9 's @entity85			1
@entity53 could not have been expected to save it ; it was too far into the corner of his net , and @entity1 had taken the first steps on the road to regaining his form			1
@entity0 ( left ) had promised @entity9 fans that they would see a stronger @entity1 upon his return from injury @entity1 , and @entity9 , played well and despite only just winning , deserve their place in the fifth round draw as the half - time whistle blew , most players trudged towards the tunnel , grateful for a rest			1
he continued at the same pace he 'd played the first 45 , running towards the changing rooms			0
get the team - talk done , and let us get back out there			0
he was hungry for more			0
@entity9 netted a third in the second - half , after a brief scare from @entity31 when @entity111 brilliantly fired into @entity113 's net , and after that things calmed down			1
in the eyes of many , the tie was won and it was now about maintaining a steady pace for @entity9			2
@entity1 's game slowed too			1
it is to be expected in his first game back , of course			0
this is just the beginning , providing that he stays injury - free			0
@entity31 pulled another back ; 3 - 2			0
@entity1 's final few minutes were nervy and frantic , perhaps exactly what he did n't need			2
@entity0 , at 2 - 0 and 3 - 1 , will have hoped for a simple finish but it was not forthcoming ... not if the @entity127 had anything to do with it			0
in the end , @entity9 's back - line stayed strong , @entity1 came off after 80 minutes , and they held on for a 3 - 2 win			1
the @entity70 playmaker performed well and deserved his first - half goal			1
perhaps there wo n't be a post-match changing room selfie , but @entity9 's performance did deserve a place in monday 's fifth round draw			2
for @entity1 , this is just the beginning			0
after an @entity41 tie against lower - league opposition , he can not claim to be fully reintegrated into the team			0
@entity31 will not pose the same test as , say , @entity144 a week on saturday , or @entity145 in the @entity146 later in february			0
but it 's a start , and a good one at that			2
now he must kick on and fully prove himself in the @entity56 .			0

@entity1 started his first game for @entity9 since october 5th
the @entity70 has been *sidelined* with a knee injury , but is now fit
he scored a goal in the first half ; a brilliant finish after @entity74 's assist
@entity1 played well until he was *substituted* in the 80th minute of the match
he deserved his goal , but this is just the start of his return to form
he must take his good form from the @entity41 to the @entity56
