a quaint tea room in the picturesque @entity1 has been branded the worst coffee shop in @entity3			1
nestled next to a babbling brook in the quaint town of @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity5 's @entity4 should be packed to the rafters			1
but he 's become a cult figure on @entity12 because his customer 's experiences are so awful - with one branding it a ' filthy hovel ' and the ' worst place on earth ! ' locals warn people to steer clear of the place and even staff at the nearby tourist information shop winced when we asked for directions there			1
another said : ' he 's a bit of a character to say the least and really not very nice			1
he 's really rude to customers and scares people away			1
' the @entity45 has 127 reviews on the site , with 100 deeming it ' terrible , ' nine ' poor ' and seven ' average			2
' only three people found it ' excellent ' and eight ' very good '			2
visitors tell of being snarled at for only ordering drinks , refused water , shouted at to leave for being hikers as he did n't need their money and even being reduced to tears			1
when one woman asked to use the toilet he reportedly handed her a bucket and newspaper			2
others said the owner was ' rude , ' nasty ' and ' dirty ' , that going there was like being in a @entity69 sketch and a ' horrifying ' experience			1
visitors tell of being snarled at for only ordering drinks , refused water , shouted at to leave for being hikers as he did n't need their money and even being reduced to tears bizarre : a display at the venue			1
some people enjoyed their visit as it was an ' experience ' despite being situated in the @entity1 , mr @entity5 has utter contempt for hikers who visit but defiant mr @entity5 has hit back at the claims			1
he said : ' i do n't give a s * * * what people have to say on the internet			2
' the comments on @entity12 are just moaning prats being nasty			2
if people want to know what it 's like here they should come and see if for themselves			1
' there are some customers i do n't want in here - the ones who do n't spend any money			0
' i get walkers come in and order one pot of tea between two of them for two quid			0
why would i let them take up a table when it could be filled with people eating and spending money ? ' yes , i 'll tell them they ca n't come in if they 're not eating			0
i go to a lot of effort with my food			0
if people are coming here because they 've read bad reviews on @entity12 , as long as they 're willing to spend money then i 'm happy			0
the @entity45 has 127 reviews on @entity12 , with 100 deeming it ' terrible , ' nine ' poor ' and seven ' average ' ' people might think i 'm a cantankerous old thing but i 'm old school			0
i 'm used to decent people , like caravanners , who will pay for quality			0
i 've been in business here for 11 years and survived the recession , so i ca n't be that bad			0
' i just do n't want people coming in wanting something for nothing and then going away and moaning on the internet			0
' now reviewers on trip advisor are starting to see the funny side			0
one , named fiftyandchildfree posted last weekend : ' our main impression was being in a ( cold ) timewarp with a grumpy @entity142 moaning about how @entity8 was going down the pan , mostly because of hikers not spending anything			1
' whilst i would n't recommend this place for the food or ambience , it is an experience that others might like to share - it kept us amused for some time afterwards which is more than you can say for the average cafe / tea shoppe			0
' another , @entity154 added : ' i think the trouble with this place is its best just discovered by following the hand - written advert scrawled on a piece of wood , and then just accepting and enjoying the bizarre experience - after reading reviews most people would n't go , but we had a lot of fun			0
