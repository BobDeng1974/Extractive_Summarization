@entity0 is running out of answers to reverse the form of sorry @entity3 after individual errors again proved costly			1
the @entity3 boss pleaded for more time to stamp his identity on the team in the wake of their 8 - 0 humiliation at @entity11 last weekend			1
but @entity0 says his attempt at progress is being undermined by the mistakes of his players , @entity16 and goalkeeper @entity17 the pair guilty of gifting @entity20 ’s @entity19 a match - winning double on saturday			1
@entity3 boss @entity0 shows his frustrations on the touchline as his side lose 2 - 0 to @entity20 @entity19 ( centre ) scores for @entity20 as @entity16 ( left ) and @entity28 look on @entity3 goalkeeper @entity17 can only watch as @entity19 ( left ) nets his second goal of the game ‘ we can not make any more - no more mistakes , ’ he blasted			1
‘ individual ones like that , no more , otherwise it is impossible to win games			0
‘ one was bad enough , but to have two mistakes , two goals conceded like that after last weekend , is tough			0
it ’s not something you expect or you can train ( to prevent )			0
’ @entity0 , who has been in the job for one year now , continues to talk in riddles when asked whether or not he is happy with the strength and depth of his playing personnel			2
the subtext of his coded comments is that he is not responsible for the club ’s transfer strategy and there is thought to be tension between himself and sporting director @entity55			1
@entity0 ( right ) shakes hands with @entity20 counterpart @entity57 prior to kick - off on saturday @entity17 ( centre ) is consoled by his opposite number @entity60 ( second left ) after the match @entity0 , it seems , is now unhappy with the mass turnover during the summer			1
‘ from last year , the team that started against @entity20 here , seven players ( it is six plus one substitute ) from the @entity3 line up are not at the club anymore , ’ he said			2
‘ eight of the starting 11 of @entity20 are in their squad			0
we start all the way from zero , so how can you have a consistency of understanding the game and a mentality if you are starting afresh every year ? you are always catching up			0
you need your team to get momentum			0
’ @entity0 ’s @entity3 certainly have momentum right now , only their trajectory is very much downwards .			2
