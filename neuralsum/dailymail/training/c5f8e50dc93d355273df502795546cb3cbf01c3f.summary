with @entity7 protesters outside chanting ' we do n't need your f * * * ing union ' and ' how many spare bedrooms has the @entity61 got ? ' , @entity45 aides decided to stage the event inside the shopping centre			1
but he was unable to address the crowd and only managed to speak to members of the public caught in the furore			2
as mr @entity0 battled his way through the crowd , yes protesters called out : ' this is what a political class looks like when it 's dying			1
' the visit to @entity75 's capital was supposed to be the main event in mr @entity0 's diary			1
but the extraordinary spectacle of the @entity45 leader being rushed into a car park lift came amid growing concern about threats of intimidation aimed at those opposed to independence			1
first minister @entity86 admitted ' there are always idiots in a campaign ' but insisted that ' 99 per cent of people participating in this campaign are behaving impeccably '			0
however , @entity45 msp @entity48 wrote on @entity93 after mr @entity0 's @entity2 visit : ' campaign room full of visibly shaken and upset folk who were in @entity98 - truly crappy day for democracy			1
' as a large crowd pushed him towards the shopping centre exit , mr @entity0 told journalists : ‘ i think we have seen in parts of this campaign an ugly side to it from the @entity7 campaign			1
' i think debate should be conducted in a civilised way , i think that ’s very , very important , but i understand that passions run high			0

almost half an hour later , aides emerged to tell waiting reporters that mr @entity0 would instead be appearing inside the mall			1
camera crews scrambled , reporters began running , dodging between bewildered shoppers			0
but mr @entity0 's walkabout had ground to a halt			1
surrounded by a pack , with @entity7 chants winning on volume alone , he grabbed anyone passing by who could not escape the melee			1
he had the grace to laugh when asked about intimidation , but this was a terrible spectacle , his plea for ' civilised ' debate drawn out by heckles			2
the true low point was when he disappeared into the doorway of a hair salon called @entity19 , deep irony at a time when the @entity163 complains of @entity165 cost - cutting			2
mr @entity0 went on : ' what i have enjoyed about this campaign , including today when i get the chance , is meeting people who are genuinely undecided			1
' he was also challenged over whether @entity171 is now the leader of the no campaign , after taking a more high profile role than both mr @entity0 and better together chief @entity173			1
but mr @entity0 insisted : ' he ’s a very important part of this campaign , i think he has done a very good job			1
all of us are setting out that choice			0
' i think all of us are doing our job in getting through to @entity45 voters			2
i think @entity171 is playing his role , @entity182 is playing her role , @entity173 , all of us are setting out that big choice that we face			0
