‘ he will never have to experience court or face judgement			2
‘ his victim is likely to have had to endure many difficult and painful interviews			0
‘ it is so rare that a case actually makes it to court and therefore a feeling of injustice is a big issue for the survivors of childhood sex abuse			2

he is the sole carer for his very aged and very unwell mother , that may have affected why he ’s not here today			0

’ he issued a bench warrant , backed for bail , with the condition that he surrender to the court by 9.30am today , with the case to be listed for 10am			2

the third strand - the one under which @entity1 was being investigated - concerns accusations which have emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding @entity228 , but which are unconnected to the pervert @entity229 @entity132 was launched by police after the @entity200 documentary interviewed victim 's of @entity12 's abuse			1
