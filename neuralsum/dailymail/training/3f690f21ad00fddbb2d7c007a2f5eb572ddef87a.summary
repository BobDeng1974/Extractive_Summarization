the @entity0 has pocketed nearly £ 25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms			1
the government quango passed on the private information of 8.7million drivers to dozens of companies so they could be pursued relentlessly over alleged unpaid fines			1
the latest twist in the ‘ cowboy ’ parking scandal shows the agency even divulged names and addresses of innocent people to ‘ rogue firms ’ that they knew had been convicted of criminal offences			1
the @entity0 has pocketed nearly £ 25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms the @entity19 , which highlighted the outrage during the summer , has demanded action after revealing the practice had turned into a multi-million - pound industry dubbed ‘ legalised mugging ’ by motoring groups			1
according to the @entity0 , which holds details of all registered vehicle keepers in the @entity31 , the amount it collected from parking firms more than doubled from £ 2.9million in 2010 - 11 to £ 6million in 2013 - 14			1
so far this year , it has raked in £ 4.3million from the lucrative private parking business and forecasts this will rise to £ 7.3million by the end of march 2015			2
that would make a total of £ 24.7million			0
details are sold at £ 2.50 a time , often to firms levying parking charges on drivers using privately - owned car parks at @entity45 hospitals , supermarkets , shopping centres and even tourist attractions			2
the increase in income from parking companies seeking drivers ’ details follows the ban on clamping , introduced in october 2012 , and a change in the law which allows parking operators to pursue motorists for the payment of tickets rather than having to identify the driver at the time			1
the latest twist in the ‘ cowboy ’ parking scandal shows the agency even divulged names and addresses of innocent people to ‘ rogue firms ’ that they knew had been convicted of criminal offences official @entity0 figures reveal 31 companies have paid for personal data , despite several receiving stinging criticism – and even criminal convictions – over their behaviour			1
@entity79 , for instance , spent more than £ 66,000 buying sensitive information of more than 20,000 motorists			2
yet the firm and one of its directors had pleaded guilty in march 2011 to breaching trading standards by being ‘ recklessly unfair ’			0
the company , which operated in @entity87 , admitted 36 offences , including displaying 15 misleading signs at and sending letters from a debt recovery firm without revealing it was the same company as @entity79			0
meanwhile , @entity93 , which has forked out more than £ 7million in five years , lost a court battle this year after trying to fine a motorist £ 100 for circling a car park - without stopping			0
@entity97 , 49 , spent half an hour waiting for a space without success before driving away from @entity101 car park in @entity102 , @entity103			0
@entity105 mp @entity104 said he was ‘ worried ’ about how the @entity0 was selling drivers ’ details but two months later he received a demand for £ 100 saying the couple had been caught without a ticket by an automatic number plate reader			1
@entity93 sent four further warnings to mr @entity97 and his wife before launching a court action to get the money , but the judge threw out the claim because the pair had never parked			0
@entity105 mp @entity104 , who in 2011 supported the ban on private wheel clampers and sits on the @entity121 , said he was ‘ worried ’ about how the @entity0 was selling drivers ’ details			1
he said : ‘ they have raked in a fortune			0
i think the @entity0 has a duty and a responsibility to make sure they protect the personal and private information that they hold			1
‘ part of that responsibility is to ensure they do n’t give details to unscrupulous firms who make the lives of innocent motorists a misery and who should not be trusted with it			2
the @entity0 must urgently review its practices			1
in the summer , the @entity19 has revealed the aggressive tactics used by firms to coerce hundreds of thousands of drivers into paying inflated charges			2
parking squads issue official - looking £ 100 tickets , often to drivers just a few minutes late returning to their cars			2
rogue wardens working on hospital grounds have allegedly been ordered to focus on cancer wards because patients are likely to be distracted – and therefore late returning to their cars			0
private parking companies also hit hundreds of thousands of drivers with ‘ fines ’ for minor infringements outside shops and fast - food chains			1
after issuing so - called penalty notices , they then use threats to terrify motorists into paying up			0
the campaign prompted communities secretary @entity162 to warn ‘ bully boy ’ tactics would not be tolerated and rogue firms could be prosecuted			0
the @entity0 insisted it has strict of criteria for those using its electronic database , including valid data protection registration , probation periods and audits to monitor behaviour and use of data			1
the agency also denied profiting from the sale of personal information			2
it said : ‘ the fees are set to recover the related administrative costs and this means that it is the applicant and not the taxpayer who funds this activity			0
‘ landowners would have great difficulty in enforcing their rights if motorists were able to park with impunity on private property			0
‘ if it is alleged that the terms of the contract are breached , it is considered reasonable that vehicle keeper details may be released in order to enable the landowner or his agent the opportunity to pursue their legal rights			0
‘ if this were not the case , motorists would be able to park with disregard for the law or the rights of landowners , with no prospect of being held to account for their actions			0
