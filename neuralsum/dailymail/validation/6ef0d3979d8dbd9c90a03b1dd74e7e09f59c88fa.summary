@entity15 has tried to tamp down accusations that she used her personal email account to keep her records from public review , which would support an old political narrative that @entity15 and her husband , former president @entity15 , are secretive and seek to play by a different set of rules			1
@entity1 strategist @entity108 , a former spokesman for president @entity35 's 2012 campaign , said the email controversy would help democrats in the long run by urging @entity15 to get serious about running			1

@entity15 's office said she has since turned over paper copies of more than 30,000 work emails last year at the @entity133 's request , but did not hand over about 32,000 that were private or personal records			1
