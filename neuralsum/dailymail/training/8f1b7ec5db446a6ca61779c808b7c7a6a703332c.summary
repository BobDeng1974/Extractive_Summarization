by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:31 est , 13 december 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 13 december 2013 workers from poor parts of @entity5 should be banned from moving to @entity6 until their home country ’s economy has improved , @entity2 suggested today			1
the prime minister said tougher restrictions will be needed in future to stop an influx of migrants flocking to the @entity6 in search of work and higher earnings			1
the radical idea emerged as work and pensions secretary @entity19 defied the @entity20 to declare that benefit tourism ‘ will not be allowed on my watch ’			1
clampdown : @entity2 told workers at a @entity25 factory in @entity26 that he wanted tougher rules to stop an influx of workers from poor parts of the @entity20 the government has vowed to tackle the ‘ pull factors ’ including access to benefits which it claims attract migrants to @entity6			1
from january , @entity37 and @entity38 will gain the same rights to work in the @entity6 as other @entity20 citizens and thousands are expected to move here			0
but mr @entity2 warned that problems with immigration only emerge when people choose @entity6 as a destination to settle because it is one of the wealthiest countries in @entity5			1
‘ we 're putting in very tough measures and controls but i think in the future we will need to go further , ’ he told workers at a @entity52 tea factory in @entity53			0
he said that if other countries move to join the @entity20 in future the @entity6 should insist on longer transitions			1
tour : mr @entity2 said that wealthy countries like @entity6 needed to be able to impose tougher restrictions on workers from poor nations he added : ‘ perhaps even saying until you reach a proper share of an average @entity20 gdp you ca n't have freedom of movement			1
‘ the reason for that is if you look at migration between @entity6 and @entity75 or @entity76 and @entity75 , countries of pretty even gdp , the movements are pretty much balanced			1
‘ it ’s only when you have a real imbalance when you have a poor country and a much wealthier country that you get these vast movements			2
‘ perhaps saying until your economy , until your wealth is similar to our wealth you ca n't have unrestricted movement			1
' @entity6 ' damned well should n't ' be forced by @entity5 judges to give prisoners the vote if @entity91 decides they should be barred from elections , @entity2 warned today / in a strongly - worded attack on interference from @entity96 , the prime minister called for the @entity97 to have its wings clipped			1
the defiant remarks put the government on a collision course with judges who have ruled that the @entity6 's blanket ban on votes for those behind bars is a breach of their human rights			0
the @entity97 has announced it is reopening 2,281 compensation claims by @entity6 prisoners			2
in february last year the @entity110 called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22 , despite repeated warnings from @entity96			0
since then ministers have published a draft bill on the issue , while stressing that the @entity6 @entity91 is ‘ sovereign ’ and it was up to mps to decide whether or not to comply with @entity97 rulings			0
mr @entity2 said : ' if @entity91 decides that prisoners should not get the vote then i think they damn well should n't			1
' he added : " it should be a national decision taken in our @entity91			0
' the government has unveiled a crackdown on benefit tourism , ahead of the lifting of controls on newcomers from @entity38 and @entity37			2
it includes rules that @entity20 jobseekers will no longer be paid housing benefit to subsidise accommodation costs , there will be time limits before out - of - work benefits can be claimed and migrants who currently get jobseekers ’ allowance after less than a month will have to wait three months before claiming			2
net migration in @entity6 is on the rise – driven by workers from @entity147 and other southern @entity5 countries fleeing the collapse of their eurozone economies , figures have shown			2
immigration from the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) increased to 183,000 in the year ending june , up from 158,000 the previous year			2
there was a ' statistically significant ' increase in citizens arriving for work - related reasons from the so - called @entity157 , which includes @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity76 , @entity75 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , the @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity147 and @entity168			0
mr @entity2 added : i know an influx of non skilled workers is a major cause of concern			1
we belong to the @entity20 where there are rules saying that if you apply for a job in another country you can go and take that job			0
‘ that enables @entity6 people to go and work in @entity75 , @entity147 or elsewhere and it enables @entity5 nationals to come and work here			0
‘ but there are two things we 've absolutely got to get right , firstly when a new country joins the @entity20 they should not have automatic access to our market			0
‘ @entity191 and the other eastern @entity5 countries joined in 2004 and they were given instant access to @entity6 jobs even though @entity191 and those countries are much poorer than us			2
‘ as a result the numbers that came were far bigger than anyone expected , 1.5 million came , it was one of the biggest movements in population we 've seen in the last few decades			0
‘ that was under the last government and it was a very bad decision and we must not make that mistake again			0
’ from next week migrants arriving in the @entity6 will have to demonstrate a ‘ reasonable standard of @entity211 ’ or be barred from claiming benefits			0
warning : work and pensions secretary @entity213 vowed that benefits tourism would not be allowed ' on my watch ' mr @entity213 , the @entity217 , announced that tests applied to those who end up claiming any work - related welfare payments will be tightened			1
he brushed aside complaints from the @entity222 about plans to toughen the habitual residence test which claimants must pass before they can receive benefits			0
he wrote in @entity227 : ‘ we are already fixing the broken welfare system we inherited from @entity229 but , as we end the something for nothing culture at home , it is right to ensure migrants who come here make a proper contribution			0
benefit tourism will not be allowed on my watch			1

@entity2 proposed new rule to limit immigration for poor nations
countries would have to improve economic wealth before curbs lifted
prime minister also warned prisoners ' damned well should n't get the vote '
@entity213 vows benefits tourism will not happen ' on my watch '
