@entity1 interests : @entity2 has threatened to use veto prime minister @entity2 today vowed to stick to his guns in demanding a @entity6 budget freeze , declaring : ' we 've not put in place tough settlements in @entity1 in order to go to @entity11 and sign up to big increases in @entity6 spending			1
' he made his position clear in the @entity15 hours after @entity16 denied seeking to cancel next month 's @entity18 summit if the @entity1 threatened to veto any rise in the @entity21 budget			1
but speaking to @entity22 today , mr @entity2 insisted he had ' put down a marker ' that he wanted to see a ' rigorous ' settlement			1
and he insisted neither @entity1 or @entity16 was prepared to back further big rises in spending			1
' i do n't believe that @entity16 voters want that any more than @entity1 voters , and that 's why our governments have led the argument in @entity6 for fiscal restraint , ' he said			1
mr @entity2 said on friday that he would not sign up to an agreement on the long - term @entity21 budget for 2014/20 if it amounted to a ' bad deal ' for @entity1 , sparking speculation that the negotiations may run into the sand			1
the @entity42 said @entity16 chancellor @entity43 was planning to warn @entity44 that she will have the november summit called off unless he is ready to show flexibility			1
but mrs @entity43 's spokesman @entity47 today told a news conference : ' it is not true			0
i categorically deny this report			0
' the @entity16 government has an interest in the success of this special summit in november and supports @entity18 president @entity55 in the goal to get an agreement on the long - term 2014 - 2020 budget			1
' mrs @entity43 is trying to persuade mr @entity2 to accept a @entity16 compromise which would cap @entity21 spending at 1 per cent of @entity6 gdp , rather than the 1.1 per cent proposed by the @entity62			1
but the prime minister has made clear he does not see any case for a rise above inflation			0
it was reported that the @entity16 chancellor would use a visit to @entity44 early next month to tell mr @entity2 that there was no point in holding a summit if he insists on a veto			1

' we have said that we do n't see a case for increases in spending above the rate of inflation			2
' countries around the @entity21 are having to take some very tough decisions on spending			1
the level of public debt across the @entity21 in 2012 is 50 per cent more than it was in 2007			2
' on average , countries are expecting spending as a percentage of gdp to fall by 8 per cent between 2010 and 2014			2
' this is a time when many countries are having to take some very difficult decisions and that should be reflected in the discussions we are having in the @entity21 on the budget			2
' wrangling over the @entity21 budget is likely to dominate talks which mr @entity2 will have with mr @entity55 at 10 @entity44 on thursday			1
mr @entity2 set out his position at a @entity11 press conference last friday			2
' it just would not be acceptable to see a huge increase in @entity21 spending at a time when other budgets are being cut , ' he said			1
' if there is n't a deal that is good for @entity1 , if there is n't a deal available then there wo n't be a deal			1
' we can not have @entity6 spending going up and up and up when we are having to make difficult decisions in so many different areas			2
