a daredevil duo have become the first to complete @entity2 's toughest climb - in a gruelling challenge that took an entire day			1
adventurers @entity3 and @entity5 battled a series of brutal ascents throughout the @entity8 almost entirely without ropes			1
the pair overcame tiredness , hunger and pain during the day and into the night - and even lost 3.5kg of weight during the 22 hour and 36 minute marathon			1
their climb even included almost 24 miles of running between each route - as well as having to eat enough food to provide 6000 calories			1
in doing so , they smashed a series of climbing records across the @entity36 and @entity37 areas set by climbers @entity38 and @entity40			0
mr @entity3 , from @entity41 , said : ' on the surface the climbing appears relatively straight forward with only approximately 6,000ft of ascent			2
' but it 's the style of the route that really kills you - @entity38 and @entity40 routes seek out the burliest , steepest and most awkward routes on the gritstone edges			0
mr @entity3 and his climbing partner overcame tiredness , hunger and pain during the day and into the night the adventurers needed head torches to navigate some of the most technical routes in the @entity2 which involved steep climbs and awkward slopes tough : the challenge was so hard that the pair lost 3.5kg of weight during the 22 hour and 36 minute marathon in completing the challenge , they smashed a series of climbing records across the @entity36 and @entity37 areas set by climbers @entity38 and @entity40 ' i felt like i had jelly for arms and it was a reminder skin is n't so tough			1
' add on 23.6 miles of running between crags and routes and trying not to get lost in seven hours of solo climbing done in darkness it was a challenge			2
' in 2009 the pair climbed all of the @entity37 routes taking them 10 hours to climb over 1500ft of rock			0
it was then mr @entity5 came up with the idea of linking two sets of routes together and the challenge was set			2
in 2009 the pair climbed all of the @entity37 routes taking them 10 hours to climb over 1500ft of rock painful : the pair pushed the boundaries of their physical capabilities as they took on the challenge in the @entity8 @entity3 , pictured at @entity97 , said the challenge left him feeling ' like i had jelly for arms ' thirsty work : the pair came up with the idea of linking two sets of climbs in one day five years ago and have now made the dream become a reality mr @entity3 added : ' i said to @entity5 " who 's going to actually do that ? it 's an absolute monster day out "			1
' fast forward five years and there i was on a september night at 10pm preparing myself for the unthinkable			0
' during the weeks leading up to the attempt we had been out on the edges slowly improving our soloing skills , learning more than 130 pitches of climbing , practicing the approaches and devising our strategy			0
' most importantly we 'd worked hard on driving an unstoppable motivation - there was no chance we would get through it without some serious knuckling down and suffering			0
' we both went through so many different emotions throughout the whole process			0
