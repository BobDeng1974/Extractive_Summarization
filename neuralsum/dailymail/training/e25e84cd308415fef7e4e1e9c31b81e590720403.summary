@entity1 's retirement from international football will leave a huge hole in @entity5 ’s midfield			1
i do n’t see any midfielder currently in or around the squad who can replicate what he does and deliver the range of passing he has from deep positions			2
@entity13 must have been bitterly disappointed that he could n’t persuade him to stay on for another two years			0
undoubtedly his decision to quit the international game will benefit @entity17 enormously and damage @entity5 ’s hopes , especially as they play their toughest opponents in @entity21 qualifying , @entity22 , a week tomorrow			1
with @entity24 retiring , too , and the manager having to cope with injuries , there is an obvious lack of experience in the midfield			1
but now the captain has gone , it will be up to the new guard to assume the mantle			2
we do not have a player who can sit deep as @entity1 has done latterly in his career and deliver those 40 - or 50 - yard passes			1
i ’m hoping that in the friendly against @entity54 on wednesday we see him step up to international level			0
perhaps he might even blossom now he will be the main man and @entity1 has gone , as the manager will have to hang his hat on him			1
though @entity50 has thrived in the past 18 months at club level , taking leaps and bounds forward in his form , we have yet to see that in an @entity5 shirt			2
he does have the ability in his locker			0
look at the pass he played to help set up @entity67 ’s goal in the opening game of the season			0
he can deliver those exquisite balls , but he has to do so more consistently			0
with @entity5 , he tends to regress to a more stilted game where he goes short , square and back			2
this is a challenge for him to seize the opportunity and to dominate			0
time to step up : @entity50 ( centre ) could take advantage of @entity1 's retirement but the player i think @entity13 will be most positive about is @entity79			1
he has that flexibility as a midfielder in that he can play wide and in the middle and as such has a few strings to his bow			2
he still plays a little bit off the cuff , which is a good thing , as he gives you that injection of pace and creativity wherever he plays			0
before the @entity40 and his unfortunate injury , he looked like he was playing himself into the team			0
but he can add real quality to @entity5 ’s midfield : look at the lovely little clipped ball he played in for @entity97 at @entity98			1
it ’s @entity79 ’s early - season form that has impressed me the most			2
he has come back from his injury and picked up the reins from where he left off in those @entity105 friendlies			0
he might end up in central midfield permanently , as @entity107 likes him in that role , and i think he will be there for these @entity5 matches , with @entity50 sitting and possibly his @entity111 team - mate @entity110 alongside him			1
@entity110 could play in the role that @entity114 would have filled in an attacking midfield before injury ruled him out			1
there are huge gaps in the @entity5 midfield but that means huge opportunities as well			1
it ’s up to @entity50 , @entity79 and @entity110 to seize them			2
exciting times : @entity79 has impressed for @entity111 in the opening weeks of the season can we now get even more out of @entity127 ? @entity127 is the new @entity5 captain and he was the obvious choice , but i ’m hoping that we will now see an even better player in the @entity5 shirt			1
it ’s not that @entity127 does n’t play well for @entity5 ; he does			1
even at the @entity40 , when he came in for some criticism after the @entity136 game , you could see that he was doing his job and performing at a higher level than most players could reach			0
but you feel there is still more to come from @entity127 with @entity5 , even at the age of 28			1
sometimes giving a player that responsibility , and the reassurance that he is your top man , can allow him to thrive			0
@entity145 was my captain with @entity5 and he relished the idea of being our leader			1
he would have always given 100 per cent whatever , but maybe it just lifted his game a little			0
that ’s what i ’m now hoping to see from @entity127			2
leading by example : @entity127 was named @entity5 captain by @entity13 last week why @entity155 will have to do @entity157 's running it seems the whole football world will be waiting to see which @entity160 turns up when @entity162 take on @entity17			1
he is a one - off and he does unusual things — on and off the pitch			0
at his best he has the ability to run off the back of defenders , to score goals , to hold the ball up and to win headers if you get crosses in			0
but it totally depends on his mood			0
on another day he wo n’t run in behind people , he ca n’t hold the ball up and he does n’t go for headers			0
his best games are nine out of 10 marks performances , but his worst are four out of 10			0
to be a quality player he needs to make sure that his worst performances are sevens			0
as i wrote last week , if @entity184 can coax that out of him , he will have an absolute bargain			0
raring to go : @entity160 ( centre ) could prove to be an astute signing for @entity17 after costing £ 16million all change : @entity155 ( left ) will have to play the @entity191 role after the arrival of @entity160 your worry would be the number of times he has had to be substituted early in games because he was n’t delivering			1
it happened again at the @entity40 when @entity136 coach @entity200 had to take him off at half - time in their match against @entity205 because his performance was so erratic			0
his relationship with @entity155 will be one to watch			2
@entity155 likes to be the main man up top of the attack and @entity191 used to do a lot of the work in behind him , chasing down the ball and dropping in			1
there ’s no way @entity160 will be doing that , so i would imagine @entity155 will now be asked to carry out the @entity191 role , when i ’m pretty sure he would rather play as the furthest - forward striker			1
but if you ’re going to play two up front — and you would want both of those players on the pitch — then someone will have to sacrifice himself a little and it definitely will not be @entity160			1
however it turns out , we wo n’t be able to take our eyes away as the story unfolds			0
. @entity230 again have the chance to prove themselves against the best in the @entity234 with @entity235 in their group			1
i know they beat @entity235 away last year , but that was after the @entity239 had qualified			2
a better guide would be the 3 - 1 lesson @entity235 gave @entity230 at the @entity242			1
i ca n’t believe @entity243 will have two up front again			0
in the @entity234 you have to adjust your tactics			2
city have the depth , the experience and the quality to do better again this year — but i still suspect they ’ll be second to @entity235 in their group .			1

i do *n't* see any midfielder who can replace @entity1
there will be a lack of experience in the @entity5 midfield
@entity24 has also hung up his international boots
but @entity79 can add real quality to the @entity5 side
@entity127 could be even better after being named @entity5 captain
@entity155 will likely play the @entity191 role at @entity17
@entity160 will not be running down the ball
i expect @entity230 to finish behind @entity235 in @entity234
