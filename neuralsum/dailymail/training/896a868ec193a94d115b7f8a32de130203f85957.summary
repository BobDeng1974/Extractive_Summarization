if @entity2 makes it into the full @entity5 squad next month then nobody at @entity1 will be more proud of him than @entity6			1
after seven years at the club @entity7 international @entity6 is passionate about @entity1 's prospects – an attitude that spilled over last season during a furious dressing room row in which a punch was allegedly thrown at the young striker			1
in the fall - out to the incident there were fears that @entity2 might try to force a move – and former player @entity20 claimed he 'd been picked on during his time at the club			1
@entity2 ( centre ) is knocking on the @entity5 door after an impressive start for @entity1 this year @entity6 ( pictured playing for @entity26 in @entity27 ) would be proud of @entity2 if he earned the call but as @entity1 take on @entity29 at the @entity30 on monday @entity6 is unrepentant about the incident and says the club 's senior players are not bullies but simply proud to set high standards			1
and with @entity2 earning rave reviews as the @entity39 's top @entity38 goal scorer so far , he revealed : ' we have just had a meeting about standards			1
the manager sets them really well and demands us as players to meet them every day			2
' he starts it and we follow			2
i would n't say there is bullying involved , i just think it is professionals trying to be the best that they can be			2
' the dressing room is 100 per cent a better place now			0
new players have come in and mingled really well , and we have got a few good leaders in there			0
' and as for @entity2 , he has been terrific , his goal scoring speaks for itself			1
you give the lad a chance and he will put it away , he 's proven that , and he 's even stepping up for penalties			0
' @entity6 has been at the heart of @entity1 's bright start to the season , played by new boss @entity67 in a deeper role that he repeated with success for @entity26 in last week 's @entity71 qualifiers			1
@entity2 starred for @entity72 's @entity5 under 21 side against @entity74 last week and he 's relishing the football which @entity67 , initially an unpopular choice among the club 's fans , is encouraging the team to play			1
the 28 - year - old said : ' we are trying to pass the ball a lot more			0
if you look at the @entity86 game we played something like 600 passes			0
the @entity89 in the back room say that was @entity93 standard			0
' i think we had 11 new players as well as a new manager so it was going to take time , but everybody has got fit , we have a group who are willing to work for the manager			0
that 's the start , and now we need to keep going			2
' everybody has gelled just on the training pitch			0
we 've had a lot of fun , the coaching staff have put on good sessions , and that is how we have got together , as simple as that			0
