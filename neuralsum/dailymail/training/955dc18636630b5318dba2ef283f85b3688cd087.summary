@entity2 midfielder - turned - striker @entity0 intends to use a few days to recharge before the title quest resumes at the weekend			1
@entity0 spared @entity2 's blushes at the end of their festive programme by striking twice to edge out battling @entity7 in the @entity9 third round			1
@entity2 toiled against the @entity11 side at the @entity12 , needing @entity0 's second - half double , which included an injury - time winner , to scrape through 2 - 1			1
@entity2 midfielder @entity0 is looking forward to a mini-break after festive fixture fun it brought the busy @entity18 spell , which saw @entity2 pull level with @entity20 at the top of the @entity22 , to a successful conclusion and left them looking ahead with plenty of optimism			1
there was the blemish of a 2 - 2 draw with @entity30 on december 28 , but @entity2 are still unbeaten in 13 and in good shape for a tough month that culminates with a trip to @entity34			1
they return to league action with a trip to @entity37 on saturday and then host @entity38 the following week			0
@entity39 international @entity0 told @entity40 : ' it is nice to have a spare week with the amount of games we have had and some of the injuries			2
some of the lads have had to play a lot of games			0
' it is important we recover now , and we use this week to refresh			0
' it slows down a bit now but i think it has been a pretty successful festive period - we have closed the gap			2
we had one blip but have been on a pretty good run , even though we have had a few injuries			0
' @entity0 ( right ) scored both of @entity2 's goal in their 2 - 1 comeback win against @entity7 in the @entity9 injuries to strikers @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 saw midfielder @entity0 pressed into action as a makeshift centre - forward in december			1
@entity66 is now back in action but so ineffective were @entity2 in the first half against the @entity71 that @entity0 was pushed back up front after the break			1
he responded on what was his 29th birthday by cancelling out @entity77 's 14th - minute strike after 65 minutes , although it also needed the double introduction of @entity80 and @entity81 to spark @entity2 into life			2
wednesday remained well organised and went close to securing a replay but @entity0 was in the right place in the first minute of injury time to turn in a @entity87 cross			2
striker @entity66 ( centre ) started sunday 's @entity9 tie against @entity7 @entity0 said : ' the manager changed it at half - time and asked me to go through the middle and it seemed to work , so good decision from him			1
it 's just nice that he 's asked me to go up there and i 've managed to do a job			0
' it 's a bit different but i played there when i was a bit younger and i think it is just about understanding the role			0
' sometimes it is about occupying the centre - halves and giving the likes of @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity109 ( @entity110 ) a bit more room to get in the holes and get on the ball			0
' if someone can do that , with their ability they are going to cause all sorts of problems			0
' @entity0 ( centre ) moved up front and proved to be @entity2 's hero , after @entity66 was substituted in the second half city had been expected to cruise through against opponents they thrashed 7 - 0 when they met in the @entity130 in september			1
it proved a tough encounter for what was , despite six changes , a strong @entity2 side but @entity0 was just pleased to get the job done			1
he said : ' we did n't play well at all but the @entity9 is about getting results and we managed to do that			2
we were under no illusions it was going to be a tough game , but we were coming off the run of a lot of games			0
it is nice to have a free week now			0
