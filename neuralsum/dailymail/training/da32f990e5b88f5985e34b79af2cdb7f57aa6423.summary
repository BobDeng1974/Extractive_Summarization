by @entity0 published : 12:56 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 15:11 est , 4 october 2013 a team of engineers from @entity3 , @entity4 , have produced gasoline formed from @entity6 for the first time few people who have eaten food contaminated with @entity6 and have suffered food poisoning as a result could imagine that there might be a good use for the bacteria			1
but @entity16 engineers have discovered a method of producing gasoline from the germ , which adds to the increasing number of biofuels			2
the scientists said that the chemical composition of gasoline is quite simple as is is made up almost exclusively of hydrocarbons ( or alkanes ) with some additives and blending agents			0
increasing concerns about the environment and limited fossil fuels have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from a range of sustainable resources			0
although scientists have successfully produced diesel using microbial methods , they have not had much luck in making gasoline , which is equally in demand as a fuel for various modes of transport			0
researchers have previously made long chain alkanes to create diesel , but have struggled to replicate short - chain hydrocarbons that can be used to create a substance similar to gasoline			1
however , the team of engineers from @entity3 , @entity4 , have cracked the problem to produce gasoline formed from @entity6 for the first time , dvice reported			2
@entity16 engineers ' discovery of making gasoline from @entity6 ( pictured ) could add to an increasing array of sustainable biofuels as well as potentially leading to people deliberately cooking with an @entity6 - derived product , in the form of vegetable oil , and even wearing it in the form of make - up they did this by using metabolic engineering to make short fatty acid derivatives that allow biosynthesis of short - chain alkanes			1
which yielded the gasoline as well as fatty esters and alcohols , simply by adding extra enzymes			0
their discovery could lead to people deliberately cooking with an @entity6 - derived product - vegetable oil , and even wearing in in the form of make - up			1
however , the technique is still in its infancy and on a small scale			1
it has only produced 580mg of gasoline per litre			0
but with refinements in performance , productivity and concentration , it could one day prove a viable and flexible substance .			0

the technique is still in its infancy and on a small scale but could one day the bacteria could be a viable sustainable biofuel
