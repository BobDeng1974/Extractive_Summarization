by @entity0 @entity1 , 27 , murdered an 18 - year - old student in a random attack - just 12 days after carrying out a ' trial - run ' which police failed to properly investigate a murderer who stabbed a gap - year student to death in a random street attack could have been stopped if police had launched a ' thorough and timely ' investigation into a similar attack two weeks before , an investigation has found			1
gap - year student @entity14 , 18 , was handing out his cv in @entity16 when he was knifed to death in broad daylight by @entity1 , 27 , in january last year			1
the assassin walked up to the teenager and stabbed him four times in the chest because he ‘ simply wanted to see what it ’s like to kill someone ’			0
but a probe by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) found @entity1 could have been stopped from committing the fatal attack , if officers had investigated a ' trial - run ' that @entity1 carried out twelve days earlier			1
in that attack , the defendant ran up to another stranger in @entity34 and punched him , before driving off in his vehicle			1
the victim made a note of @entity1 's vehicle registration number and reported the incident to police on january 4			1
but @entity1 was not tracked down by police - and was ' emboldened ' to carry out the second attack			1
in its report , the @entity27 said the officer who investigated the incident ' did not pursue appropriate lines of inquiry ' - despite having the vehicle registration number and a description of the assailant			2
the officer also failed to properly handle evidence , keep an adequate record of evidence within his pocket notebook , promptly create a crime report or keep it adequately updated			2
@entity14 - @entity14 , 18 , right , was handing out his cv in @entity16 in the hope of finding a job when @entity1 stabbed him four times in the chest in front of shocked witnesses @entity27 commissioner @entity63 said : ' this was a shocking and unprovoked murder of a promising young student			1
my thoughts are with @entity14 ’s family and friends at this difficult time			0
' we will sadly never know whether a more prompt investigation might have deterred @entity1 from going on to commit the grave crime of murder , but it is clear that the officer did not investigate the initial assault quickly and thoroughly enough , despite being provided with clear lines of inquiry			1
' there are lessons for @entity82 to learn from these events to improve the service they provide in future			0
' mr @entity14 had been accepted to study history at @entity88 and had just returned from the @entity89 where he had been coaching football when the murder took place			0
he was heading into @entity16 to find a job when he was attacked in front of stunned witnesses			1
@entity1 was then seen by witnesses to be laughing and sniggering as he ran back to his car and drove to his student flat in @entity99			1
the teenager died later the same day in hospital			0
@entity14 's mother @entity102 , right , and @entity103 pictured left , called the murder ' completely senseless ' and said it was a ' random , violent assault ' @entity1 admitted killing mr @entity14 but claimed it was manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility after saying he was responding to voices in his head			1
he was found guilty of murder after a trial in july last year and was sentenced to a minimum of 23 years in jail			1
during the sentencing , mr justice @entity115 told him : ' i ’m satisfied that having escaped detection for that attack ( in @entity34 ) you were emboldened to undertake another one , this time with deadly intent			1
' after the @entity27 findings , detective chief inspector @entity123 said the force accepted the conclusion of the investigation			2
he said : ' @entity82 accepts the @entity27 ’s recommendations in relation to this case			0
we will always strive to improve the service we provide to the public			0
' @entity82 accept that the officer concerned did not conduct a thorough and timely investigation into the assault which occurred in @entity34			1
' the officer in question faced internal misconduct proceedings which were held in march of this year			2
' it was found that the officer did not meet the standards of professional behaviour expected from a police officer			2
' a finding of misconduct was upheld against the officer who received management action			0
our deepest condolences are with @entity14 - @entity14 ’s family and friends at this time			2
' after the trial last year , mr @entity14 ’s mother , @entity151 , 45 , said : ' it is so completely senseless			2
people have said things like he was in the wrong place at the wrong time , but he was n’t			0
' he was just walking along enjoying himself and somebody has attacked him			0
he did not have a chance to do anything			0
it was just a random , violent assault			0
' the watchdog said it also made recommendations around several gaps identified in @entity82 ’s policies and procedures			0
these included the use of the violent crime handover policy force - wide ; improved performance reviews and improved communications between intelligence staff , control room staff and operators .			0
