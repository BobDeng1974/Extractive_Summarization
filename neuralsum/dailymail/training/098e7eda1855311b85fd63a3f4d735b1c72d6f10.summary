@entity0 has been jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing 10 young boys in two schools in the 1970s and 1980s a former housemaster at a prestigious @entity5 private school has been jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing pupils			1
@entity0 , 61 , took advantage of boys as they slept in their dormitory beds and during singing lessons at @entity13 , @entity8 's @entity7 heard			1
@entity0 invited the youngsters to his flat and ' spanked ' them when they had broken school rules			0
he also crept into pupils ' dormitory and touched them while carrying out night - time checks , his trial was told			1
many of his victims studied at the Â£ 16,000 - a - year choir school , while others were abused at the @entity28 monk - run @entity25 in @entity29 , where @entity0 taught after leaving @entity13			1
the attacks , which took place between 1978 and 1984 , were carried out on boys aged eight to 13			1
sentencing @entity0 today , judge @entity33 told him : ' all these boys were to some degree emotionally and physically vulnerable - some were more so than others			1
you took advantage of that and made it all the worse by what you did			0
' what you did has remained more or less a secret for the best part of 35 years until now			0
but for the courage of all 10 complainants , in particular those most affected , a secret it would have remained			0
' a jury found @entity0 , from @entity52 , guilty of 15 counts of indecent assault on boys under the age of 14 following a trial last month			1
@entity0 bowed his head in the dock throughout today 's hearing and showed no emotion as his sentence was delivered			1
his wife and son were in the public gallery along with most of the retired teacher 's victims , many of whom were supported by their wives and partners			2
judge @entity33 said : ' all ( of the victims ) were entrusted to your care as a member of staff at school			0
that trust was seriously betrayed by what you did			0
' the judge said many victims were ' severely confused ' at the time of the abuse , some of whom were ' unsure if it was right or wrong '			0
' i 'm quite sure you have caused a number of your victims serious psychological harm , ' he added			0
judge @entity33 said victims were left ' ashamed and embarrassed ' by @entity0 's ' selfish sexual acts ' , which had ' sullied ' the reputations of two institutions			2
the court heard that some of the victims came forward after reports of @entity101 , the police investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of the @entity106 scandal			1
many of the victims felt @entity0 had ' violated them all over again ' by denying the offences and taking them to trial			2
the first of the offences took place at @entity8 's prestigious @entity13 ( pictured ) following the sentencing , @entity114 , solicitor for one of the victims , said : ' this is the best sentence the victims could have hoped for			1
proper justice has been done			2
' there has been a great deal of pain and this has enabled , certainly in my client , some closure			0
' it 's never complete and it would have been helpful if there had been evidence of remorse or contrition			2
' one former pupil told the court he was 10 years old when he was abused			2
the inappropriate touching began as ' massages ' during piano lessons			0
in 1981 , one of @entity0 's victims complained about being repeatedly abused by him , and shortly afterwards the teacher left the prestigious school , prosecutor @entity139 said			1
however , it was not long before @entity0 started working at @entity25 , where he abused four of his 10 victims			1
the man told the trial : ' he called me upstairs , and i remember thinking " here we go again , i am going to get some more of this "			0
@entity0 denied the charges , meaning his victims had to go through the stress and heartache of a lengthy trial in mitigation , @entity156 said father - of - five @entity0 ' removed himself from temptation ' by no longer working with boys under 13 after he left @entity25			1
she said : ' mr @entity0 bears the burden that he has brought such misery and shame to his family			0
' following the hearing , detective sergeant @entity164 , of the @entity166 's sexual offences , exploitation and child abuse command , said : ' @entity0 was a well - respected and talented teacher			1
' he knew the boys he targeted felt hugely loyal to their schools and their teachers			2
he used this knowledge to abuse his position of trust in a truly terrible way			0
' despite the abuse , his victims , now all adults , somehow found the courage to relive their experiences			0
that courage has directly secured @entity0 's conviction and we can only hope that they can now find some closure			0
