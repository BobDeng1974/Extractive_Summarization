not police , not even fire department if there ’s a fire			0
sharia courts have been allowed to be established			0
prayer rugs in just about every hotel			0
' just a few days later , @entity118 welcomed analyst @entity88 on her show , who said of these zones , believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start ; ' they ’re sort of amorphous , they ’re not contiguous necessarily , but they ’re sort of safe havens			0
' response : @entity2 presenter @entity127 told viewers : ' over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air '			0
she added the apology applies to ' discussions of so - called no - go zones ' @entity88 then took the idea a step further by stating ; ' and they ’re places where the governments , like @entity8 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 — they do n’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where @entity147 courts are set up , where @entity44 density is very intense , where police do n’t go in			2
' finally , @entity88 wrapped the segment up by making the claim that @entity43 , @entity42 was an example of one of these zones , and that ' non-muslims just simply do n’t go in			1
' @entity2 ultimately issued corrections for these statements , as well as an apology			0
that , however , was not enough for mayor @entity1			2
