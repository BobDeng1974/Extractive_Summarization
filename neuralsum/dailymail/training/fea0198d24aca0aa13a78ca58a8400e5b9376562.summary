by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 09:35 est , 7 september 2012 vile @entity2 killer @entity1 may have to be deported to the @entity2 on a chartered flight after twice wreaking havoc on commercial jets in @entity6			1
the murderer had spent 22 years locked up after drowning his wife at their @entity10 home in 1989			0
yesterday the 66 - year - old had to be removed from a @entity14 flight at @entity15 after he spat at a crew member , smashed a tv monitor , tore a telephone from a phone seat , screamed abuse at passengers , urinated in a holding cell and tried the same in an aisle			1
@entity1 terrorised passengers and crew at @entity15 until he was kicked off his flight now @entity6 authorities are considering paying for a private jet to fly him back to @entity2 – at an estimated cost of $ 1million - £ 600,000 - to @entity6 taxpayers			1
he caused similar problems the day before on a @entity34 jet			0
that resulted in three security guards and an immigration official boarding the plane to take him off to prevent further alarm to passengers			2
britons convicted of serious crimes in @entity6 are almost always deported to the @entity2 once they have served their time			0
but @entity1 has shown his determination to remain in @entity6			1
@entity6 authorities hoped the killer would have a swift departure but he had other plans after his release from jail he was moved to @entity51 , on the edge of @entity10 , to await deportation			0
from there launched a determined fight to remain in @entity6			0
he took his case to the @entity57			0
but this week he lost his bid to stay and was escorted to the @entity34 jet			0
but his wild and abusive behaviour frightened passengers and crew so much he was escorted from the plane , @entity10 ’s @entity60 reported today			1
a second attempt to fly him to @entity2 , this time on a @entity14 jet , also failed			0
once again he verbally abused passengers and crew			1
in a phone call with the paper earlier this year @entity1 admitted for the first time he was guilty of murder and complained about his accommodation			1
‘ i caused a death			2
i paid my time , ’ he said			2
‘ the rooms are dirty , the areas we live in are dirty			1
i have a heart condition i am waiting for an operation			1
’ during @entity1 ’s unsuccessful 1995 appeal against his conviction , supreme court judge @entity80 claimed he had ‘ an extraordinarily manipulative nature			1
’ worried he will try to cause further mayhem on another commercial flight , the @entity6 authorities are considering their options to get rid of the killer			2
the alternative to paying for a private plane is to book rows of seats on a regular flight to isolate him			1
that would also cost tens of thousands of pounds			2
a spokesman for @entity6 ’s @entity96 insisted they were examining all options ‘ for the removal of this client at the earliest opportunity and in the most cost effective way			1
’ the brute was removed from the airport but @entity6 insists he will go back to @entity2 he added : ‘ misbehaviour in no way deters the department			2
’ herring already had a prison record when he was granted a migration visa to @entity6 in the early 1990s			2
in the @entity2 he had been convicted for assault and grievous bodily harm			0
in @entity6 , he was convicted of killing his @entity117 - born wife in the swimming pool of their @entity10 home in 1995			0
he claimed he was innocent but the prosecution said bruises on her head pointed to foul play			0
during his trial herring exposed himself , called the prosecutor a ‘ fat slug ’ and leapt from the dock at the judge			1
in jail he committed numerous offences , mainly assault and intimidation			0
his behaviour - on top of the murder conviction - assured him of deportation once he walked free			0
but the refusal by commercial pilots to fly herring may leave the @entity6 government with no option but to choose the expensive option for fly him alone but for his police minders .			0

@entity1 abused crew , smashed tv , broke phone and urinated in cell
private plane set to cost taxpayers £ 600,000 after he is booted off jets
*monster* *moaned* he had a heart condition and accommodation was ' dirty '
judge *branded* *criminal* a man of ‘ an extraordinarily manipulative nature . ’
