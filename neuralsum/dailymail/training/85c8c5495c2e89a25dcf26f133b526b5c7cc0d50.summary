by @entity0 from hot flushes to hormone - induced breakouts , the menopause can play havoc on your skin as well as your temper			1
but although there 's an abundance of advice on what food to eat and which herbal remedies to take , little attention has been paid to looking good - until now			1
celebrity make - up artist @entity15 , who has worked with @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 among others , has come to the rescue with a beauty tutorial that reveals how to hide those hot flushes - and look in tip - top shape at the same time			1
' this film hopefully breaks that taboo with some useful tips , warm friendly advice and a good sprinkling of humour			1
' the perfect menopausal make - up look begins with a good base , in @entity38 's case , @entity49 and @entity50			1
next comes a layer of @entity52 likes @entity53 - which , @entity38 says , will give mature skin plenty of nourishment while staying in place all day			1
' if you happen to have a hot flush , this really will stay on , ' adds @entity38			1
' although it has a setting feeling , you can feel it 's long - lasting and it leaves a dewy finish			2
' tips and tricks : @entity15 says that the right coverage is important for ladies who get hot flushes and perspire a lot , she recommends a bb cream and concealer stick for on the go for those dealing with greasy skin , @entity38 has this advice : ' if you 're having a greasy reaction to the menopause and your skin is oily because your hormones are going out of whack , then something like @entity53 's @entity84 is good because it will cover rosacea and blemishes			1
' @entity88 to tackle are hot flushes and perspiration , both of which can prove deadly for foundation 's staying power			1
to beat the sweats , she suggests skipping the bb cream and instead opting for @entity96 , dabbed on in certain areas so that , if your make - up does sweat off , you 'll only have a few areas to touch up			1
next up is concealer , which for @entity38 , means @entity105 's @entity104 , explaining : ' this is really moisturising so it 's fantastic if you 're experiencing very dry skin , ' she reveals			2
' it really lifts shadows without emphasising any fine lines and has some really nice brightening pigments in there			2
' add more to the inner corners of your eyes if you 're not sleeping well , ' she suggests			0
' also note that pink hued concealers help to counteract blueness and beware that too much highlighter is ageing			0
' lift the face with a dab of blusher , and make it one that contains anti-ageing ingredients such as by @entity129 's @entity128			2
that 's a good trick ! for lips , she uses a @entity134 lipliner and dabs some of the eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding ' if you 're experiencing the redness that comes with the menopause , skip this step , ' advises @entity38			2
' but if you have even - toned skin then a little bit of colour in the face is really beautiful			2
' for eyes , @entity38 smooths @entity150 primer all over the lids , which she says is brilliant if you 're having a hard time getting shadow to stay put			0
beauty guru : @entity15 's handiwork can be seen regularly on runways , red carpets and glossy covers , with a client list that reads like a who 's who of @entity164 's most glamorous she also recommends using waterproof eye make - up , citing @entity168 eyeliner as her favourite			1
' smudge it on , ' she recommends			0
' the messier you put [ it on ] , the better but make sure you get to the roots of the lashes and massage the pencil in there '			2
if your lashes are falling out , she says a coat of @entity179 on the top lashes can help			0
she also loves @entity182 eyebrow pencils , which , she says , just wo n't budge , even if you 're wiping your face all day due to perspiration			2
on the lips , @entity38 uses a @entity134 lipliner and dabs some eyeshadow primer above the lips to avoid any smudging or lipstick bleeding			0
finish off the look with a slick of @entity193 , which , @entity38 says , helps lips look plumper			0
' if you want to amp this make - up up , it 's better to amp up the eyes , ' she says of making the look work for evening			1
' the eyes are easier to maintain than skin			0
invest in a really good magnifying mirror			0
no less than 10x -15x magnification			0
you can buy ones that attach easily to your bathroom mirror and smaller travel ones for your handbag			0
if you are experiencing a lot of hot flushes , apply as little base make - up as you feel comfortable with			1
that way there will be less touching up and patching to do			0
carry a stick foundation or compact concealer with you for selective touch ups			0
if you are perspiring a lot , avoid too much powder as water and powder do not mix well			0
if you are experiencing dry eyes , apply moisturising eye drops at least 10 minutes before starting your make - up			1
waterproof eye make - up products are technically light years ahead of where they were even a couple of years ago			1
it ’s worth investing in the most up to date formulations for mascara and eye liner			0
keep a cold , clean chamois leather in the fridge to cool your face down			0
you can also keep a small version of something like this in your bag to absorb sweat without disturbing your make - up .			1
