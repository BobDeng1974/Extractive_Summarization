‘ it ’s too easy for @entity1 – @entity2 are like mannequins ’			1
the words of @entity5 at 7.50pm			0
less than two hours later it was @entity1 looking like the dummies , beaten 3 - 1 by an average – yet impressive on the night – @entity2 side			1
in 90 minutes , @entity11 ’s team had managed to perform a distressing demonstration of every flaw and criticism which has been aimed at them in the past five years			2
here , @entity16 takes a closer look at the shortcomings which leave the @entity19 on the brink of a last - 16 exit in the @entity22 for the fifth season running			1
@entity11 ( centre ) slumps into his seat while watching @entity2 humiliate his @entity1 team @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 looked dejected after the injury - time goal let ’s start at the back , as per usual … per @entity34 is a @entity36 winner , right ? he was , of course , afforded a little bit of a @entity36 hangover when he struggled for form at the start of the campaign			1
it ’s now looking more like he ’s been on a season - long bender			2
the @entity46 is a liability			0
blameless for the first goal which deflected into the back of the net via his torso from @entity54 ’s shot ? not likely			0
it was a half - hearted attempt to close the @entity57 midfielder and it was no surprise to see his limp body serve as a detour en route to goal			2
for the second he inexplicably chose to try and win possession some 60 yards from his own goal			0
it was a baffling decision and @entity1 paid the price as @entity68 – yes , the player last season in @entity72 ’s reserves – climaxed a swift breakaway made possible by @entity34 ’s absence			1
his face in the moments after that tie - changing concession told its own story , a pained expression of regret and wondering – wondering , no doubt , just where his career is headed			2
after this , you ’d say he is n’t long for north @entity85			0
@entity46 central defender @entity34 had one of his worst nights in aa @entity1 shirt captain @entity34 ( with goalkeeper @entity89 in the background ) had an awful night against @entity2 @entity34 ’s @entity91 - tly comrade … @entity27 should not escape censure , either			1
the centre back was nowhere to be seen as @entity2 broke and netted the tie - clinching third			1
moments earlier he ’d been outdone on halfway , his lame attempt to tackle more in keeping with a team chasing an irreversible deficit , and not one trailing by a goal with the second leg still to come			0
that will ultimately prove costly			0
@entity27 ( centre ) should not escape blame after an erratic display alongside @entity34 @entity107 matters … in the space of 24 hours we have seen two of the @entity112 ’s top sides line up with a central - midfield quartet consisting of @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
is that really the best we ’ve got to offer ? @entity1 were out - fought and out - thought by the brilliant @entity54 and cunning @entity119			2
now that is a midfield pairing			0
@entity54 celebrates after scoring the first @entity2 goal in @entity85 the excellent @entity54 out - muscles @entity117 - a theme to continue throughout the 90 minutes @entity1 , on the other hand , were operating with the in - form – but out of position – @entity117 in a deeper role in which he looked entirely uncomfortable , while @entity116 , do not forget , was a reserve until one impressive performance at @entity130 cemented his place in the side			1
when are @entity1 going to sign a midfielder who marries pace and power , craft and graft – like , for example , a certain @entity54 ? @entity139 ? he certainly vanished … at £ 42million , @entity29 was bought for nights like this			1
instead , what we witnessed – when he did bother to seize responsibility – was another wishy - washy display , lacking in urgency and invention and slowed down by too many touches			2
he ’s had too many chances now			0
@entity29 failed to unlock @entity2 all night , despite being afforded plenty of the ball @entity29 has flattered to deceive since his £ 42million move from @entity154 18 months ago @entity156 misconnection … moments after @entity158 blazed over the crossbar from point - blank range , a graphic appeared on television screens – attempts 6 , on target 0			1
@entity158 just does not boast the clinical mindset of a master marksman			2
ask yourself this – would he have scored those chances at home to the likes of a @entity169 ? or even @entity171 opposition in the @entity172 ? answer : yes			0
for he did , bagging braces and accepting plaudits against both the @entity175 and @entity176 of late			0
amplify the pressure , however , and he crumbles			0
top strikers , the ones who make the difference – like @entity183 the previous evening - thrive in such surrounds			0
much - heralded good - looks maybe , but @entity158 ’s finishing was ugly against @entity2			1
he is another who simply is n’t good enough for where @entity1 want to be , presuming that is further than the last - 16 of the @entity22			1
@entity158 had a dismal night in front of goal and bore the brunt of frustration from the stands the @entity156 striker ( here heading over the bar ) missed a host of chances on wednesday night @entity158 somehow conspires to fire wide from close range as @entity1 struggled to convert their chances @entity201 the library ? a library ? @entity1 ’s old home was a cauldron of noise compared with the hushed acceptance of the @entity208			1
there are groans , yes , but where is the energy and excitement which would accompany a @entity214 night at the likes of @entity216 or , say , @entity217 ? no guts , no glory … they say you ’ve got to earn the right to play – which roughly translated in sunday - morning speak means ‘ win your battles first ’			2
@entity2 were stronger , quicker and hungrier than @entity1 in every department and were , as a result , deserving winners			1
their last two goals were classy and incisive breakaways			0
but they had earned the right to do that			0
@entity1 , meanwhile , earned nothing but a costly continental lesson			2
@entity1 's supporters failed to rouse their side out of its slumber on a disappointing night former @entity239 striker @entity68 took delight in silencing the boos and scoring for @entity2 @entity242 looks disconsolate after possession runs away from him in the second half so who is to blame ? poor @entity11 , he ’s going to need a shop full of those @entity1 puffer jackets to protect him from the battering he ’s going to take if they fail to reverse the deficit in @entity2			1
but this is his team , he did n’t inherit it			0
he is , of course , hampered by injuries			0
but he should n’t accommodate injury - prone players if that is repeatedly offered as an excuse			0
it is a team lacking in key areas – namely goalkeeper , defence , midfield and attack			0
against @entity2 , each of those was brutally exposed , and so was @entity11			1
@entity11 must take the ultimate blame , given this is his side and they are lacking in key areas @entity158 holds his head with @entity1 staring at an exit from the competition			1

@entity1 lost 3 - 1 at home against @entity2 in the @entity22
the defeat leaves the @entity19 staring at another last 16 exit
@entity11 got his *tactics* all *wrong* and @entity29 was poor
per @entity34 and @entity158 both badly struggled
