had it been 2 - 0 so early @entity7 would have controlled the game and passed real into submission			2
still the man for the big occasion			0
@entity52 - 7 steady defensively and got forward well to support the attacks			2
came back into the side for @entity55 and justified the recall			0
@entity57 defender @entity25 rises up to put real @entity0 in the lead with a header from a corner @entity61 - 6 had to work overtime in the first half as @entity8 tormented @entity64 and found space in behind the often absent @entity67 full - back			1
the two continued their duel in the second half and he was as relieved as anyone when the @entity72 departed on 70 minutes			0
@entity25 - 7 all over the place in the opening stages of the game but recovered his composure and his towering header was the most important goal of the game			1
impressive display that shows why he still keeps @entity81 out of the side … just			0
@entity64 - 6 struggled defensively in the first half especially but always has that burst of energy to turn defence into attack and as @entity7 struggled with @entity0 's counter-attacks in the second half really began to come into his own			1
@entity88 ( r ) was one of @entity0 's star performers as he seized his chance in the absence of @entity92 @entity93 - 7 still keeping his head above water in @entity0 's @entity97 midfield			2
@entity99 's shoes are tough to fill but the @entity100 did well in his first real test this season			0
set up @entity25 's goal with a perfect corner			1
@entity105 - 7 roared off in the second half as @entity107 replaced him			0
the former @entity110 man is idolized by the @entity12 and once again in the most difficult of games he stood up to be counted			0
@entity88 - 8 @entity107 said in midweek : ' @entity88 knows that if @entity92 is fit then @entity92 always plays ' but how can the @entity113 coach leave @entity88 out on this form ? come to think of it how can @entity116 leave @entity88 out on this form			0
@entity14 wheels away after equalising from the spot with his 16th league goal of the season @entity123 -7 @entity0 's fourth midfield musketeer was involved in that lightning break for the third goal			1
he will never have @entity129 's energy but he is starting to show that in terms of assists and goals he can match the @entity133			0
@entity14 - 7 not his greatest @entity5 by any stretch but he still got his goal from the penalty spot and won the personal duel with @entity40 hands down			1
was unhappy with various refereeing decisions but will be delighted with the way the game turned out			0
@entity0 showed they can win without him putting in an extra-terrestrial performance			2
@entity26 - 8 another who was cheered off when substituted			2
so often the most criticized of @entity0 's @entity146 forward line , @entity26 stepped up in the absence of @entity92 to lead the line and get the goal that sealed the win			1
@entity151 international @entity26 finished a superb move to give @entity0 a two goal advantage @entity7 @entity154 - 7 his handling was good and he did not deserve to be on the losing side			1
finally conceded his first goals of the season but then none of them could be blamed on him			0
@entity162 - 7 solid from a veteran of six years of @entity164			0
got forward and covered plenty of ground but his finally delivery often let him down when he got around the back of @entity0 ’s defence			2
@entity7 defender @entity171 is shown a yellow card that led to @entity0 's equaliser @entity171 - 7 started well holding @entity7 together when @entity0 reacted to conceding the early goal			1
but then slipped for the penalty that gave them a way back into the game			0
@entity7 need to build a defence around him and there are still question marks over whether they have done that with last summer ’s signings – @entity185 still out , and @entity186 shifted to full - back for this one			2
@entity188 - 6 the world ’s best holding midfielder was back in the centre of defence and struggled against the charge of the white brigade in the second half			0
was exposed by the open way that @entity7 played but should be used to that by now			2
@entity186 - 6 far stronger defensively than the out of form @entity199 who was left on the bench but the @entity204 international has more in his locker going forward and at times the @entity151 could not make the most of the possession that he had			0
@entity7 coach @entity209 ( r ) lost his first @entity5 as his side fell to their first league defeat @entity212 - 6 was the surprise selection in midfield ahead of @entity215 and for 45 minutes he justified that selection but tired badly in the second half			1
still has the ability to keep the ball but people forget how much ground he covered in his pomp - was ultimately over-run and outnumbered by the home side			0
@entity225 - 7 will be under pressure this season as @entity209 considers playing @entity188 in front of his defence			0
@entity230 came back into midfield for the @entity133 but @entity7 lost the midfield battle			0
was over-powered for the @entity26 goal and unable to stop @entity88 spinning away into space			2
@entity7 's midfield trio looked lightweight against @entity0 's four , especially when @entity212 slowed in the second half			1
@entity40 celebrates with @entity11 after the @entity67 opened the scoring after only four minutes @entity40 - 6 missed the kind of chance he has spent the last five years scoring with his eyes closed and it was down hill from there			1
picked up a first half booking and that seemed to sum up what was an uncharacteristic display			0
@entity8 - 8 short of scoring he did everything possible in the first half to put the game beyond @entity0			1
he set up @entity11 for the first goal and @entity40 for what should have been the second			2
@entity209 was asked after the game if he felt he had made a mistake by playing @entity8 from the start and he said : ' no , definitely not			2
' @entity11 - 8 took his goal brilliantly but failed to last the 90 minutes			1
has been around the world on international duty recently and perhaps that showed			0
@entity7 needed him to keep carrying the game to @entity0 in the second half but the threat he offered lifted and @entity52 was gradually allowed greater licence to get forward himself			1
@entity8 ( c ) impressed on his @entity7 debut after completing his four month ban			1

@entity0 defeated @entity7 3 - 1 to claim bragging rights in @entity5
