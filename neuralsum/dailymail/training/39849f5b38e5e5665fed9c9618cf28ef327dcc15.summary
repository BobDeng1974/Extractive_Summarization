by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 2 october 2013 when it comes to middle - aged men and their pet projects , a @entity4 or even a lawnmower will normally suffice			0
but not for builder @entity6 who has spent the last six years repairing a @entity8 he secretly bought on @entity9 without telling his wife			1
the 45 - year - old paid £ 10,000 for the iconic fighter plane which dropped cluster bombs during the conflict with @entity15 in 1982			1
the plane also saw action during the @entity27 war before it was retired - and bought by mr @entity6 on @entity9 for £ 10,000 in 2007 secret project : @entity6 bought the plane on @entity9 without telling his wife @entity30			1
he said she was ' shocked ' at the time - but has now grown to love it caravan park jump jet : the @entity34 is kept in a hangar at the campsite @entity37 runs with his wife in @entity39 , @entity40 , and it is popular with visitors he now estimates the jet he bought in 2007 is worth up to ten times what he paid for it but he does not want to part with it			1
mr @entity6 said his wife @entity30 , 49 , was livid when she found out he had bought the plane without telling her			1
' first of all she was a bit shocked and said " what have you done ? "			0
now she has grown to love it , ' he said			0
' it was a spur of the moment thing but hopefully it has been a good investment			0
' he added : ' i saw the @entity8 advertised on @entity9			1
i ’d never been on the site before but me and my daughter put a bid on it and actually won it the same day			0
restoration : @entity6 has spent hours sourcing and replacing missing parts on the plane which were missing when he took delivery of it in 2007 air force : the @entity19 , which can no longer fly because the engine has been removed , used to be capable of going from 735mph to hovering in the air the @entity70 played a key role in winning the @entity23 under @entity72 in 1982			1
in total , 28 of the £ 35million planes saw action in the conflict and they shot down 20 enemy planes			2
none of them were lost in action on the frontline , although six were destroyed in accidents and ground fires			0
the planes are pictured above on board @entity86 during the @entity23			1
a second upgraded @entity8 plane - the @entity88 - was manufactured from 1993			1
the planes , which were introduced in 1978 , subsequently saw action in the @entity91 between 1992 and 1995			2
they were deployed again in 1999 in @entity93 and in @entity94 in 2000			0
however , the @entity96 government announced the planes would be phased out in 2002 - and the last one was decommissioned in 2006			1
the plane was also sold to the @entity99 - and they still use a number of the planes			2
' when i first got it , i used to spend quite a bit of time sitting in it and playing with all the buttons and levers but i do n’t seem to have as much time now			0
' the 43ft @entity110 came with two 30mm cannons and the original ejector seat			0
however , the explosive charge was removed from the seat to stop the @entity37 from accidentally being fired from the cockpit			1
the £ 250,000 @entity118 engine and computer system were removed because of flying restrictions in the @entity120			1
@entity37 said it could be made airworthy again at the cost of ‘ hundreds of thousands of pounds ’			1
when it arrived from the @entity125 - based dealer he discovered it was also missing many parts on its exterior as well as the full tanks , the nozzle on its stencils			0
he scoured @entity9 and phoned specialist dealers searching for the missing parts			0
he also spent hours bringing its general condition up to scratch in a hangar at the back of the campsite he and his teacher wife run in @entity39 , @entity40			2
the fighter jet , which was capable of hovering after slowing from speeds of up to 735mph , has become a big draw for campers			0
this is in part thanks to its action - packed war history			0
the fighter was built in 1980 at a cost of £ 35 million and taken for its first flight by a @entity154			2
it was then housed at @entity156 at @entity157			0
when the @entity23 broke out it was transported to the south @entity159 onboard @entity86 , setting off from @entity160 in early april , 1982			1
the fighter flew its first combat mission on may 1 , 1982 when it was piloted by @entity165 lt cmdr @entity164 during a a raid on @entity22 airfield			2
according to the mission log it dropped three cluster bombs on ‘ airfield facilities , parked aircraft and other targets of opportunity ’			1
cluster munition is now banned by 83 nations around the world			2
during the conflict , @entity34 was one of 28 @entity180 that flew a combined 1,435 operational missions and shot down 20 enemy aircraft and probably three others			0
it later flew missions during the @entity91 from 1992 - 1995			0
the @entity186 ’s last @entity180 fighters were retired on march 28 , 2006			2
@entity37 , who grew up in @entity40 , near @entity157 , @entity157 , said : ' i love @entity180 because i grew up in this area and they used to fly over all the time			1
rundown : the damaged old @entity34 as it appeared when it was purchased by @entity6 in 2007 jump jet ... with a step ladder : @entity37 , 45 , sits in the cockpit of the plane which he has spent six years restoring after buying it on @entity9 for £ 10,000 decommissioned fighter : the explosive charge was removed from the seat to stop the @entity37 from accidentally being fired from the cockpit run down : the last @entity8 was decommissioned in 2006 - and @entity37 bought this plane online a year later new home : @entity37 keeps the plane in this shed on his campsite in @entity39 , @entity40 , and drags it out using his @entity205 ' i was also really young when the @entity23 broke out and i used to watch on the @entity180 on tv going off on the carriers everyday			1
' the @entity210 history has also made the planes highly sought - after and @entity37 claims one was sold for more than £ 70,000 earlier this year			1
' hopefully i have made quite a bit of money on it - if i ever came to sell it , which i do n’t think i will , ' said @entity37 , who has three grown - up daughters aged 25 , 21 and 20			2
' earlier this year we did have an @entity219 chap who owns a museum who was interested in buying it but i did n’t really want to sell			0
' i was open to offers but it did n’t come to anything in the end			0
so it is going to stay here for a bit longer yet			0
' if the right offer came along i probably would sell it - but it would have to be really good money			0
' flying again ? @entity37 claims the @entity8 could be repaired so it can take to the skies again - although the £ 250,000 engine has been removed @entity235 view : the @entity34 which saw action in the 1982 @entity23 and again during the @entity27 conflict in the early 1990s in action : @entity6 's @entity34 is seen ( front ) in the air with two of the same planes before retirement : @entity37 's @entity8 is seen flying over @entity245 before it was put into retirement in 2005 war mission : a pilot flies the @entity34 which @entity6 bought on @entity9 in 2007 and now keeps in a hangar on his campsite			1

@entity6 , 45 , has spent six years repairing the @entity8
his plane dropped cluster bombs during the 1982 @entity23
£ 250,000 @entity118 engine and computer have been removed from the plane
but @entity37 says it could fly again if thousands are spent upgrading it
