by @entity1 reporter @entity3 scientists have found a way to decipher dreams for the very first time			1
their report shows that patterns of activity in certain visual parts of the brain are the same whether we are awake or dreaming			0
researchers from @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity3 , scanned three male volunteers ' brains in an exhausting test over several days to examine how activity could be related to their dreams			1
@entity3 scientists have found a way to tell what people dream about by carrying out research on three men researchers scanned the volunteers ' brains as they slept to monitor activity over several days the volunteers were woken up every time they began to nod off and dream			1
each time , the men were asked what they had dreamed about before they fell back to sleep			0
the process was repeated until an enormous 200 reports had been collated from each man			0
the results showed that most of the dreams were about mundane , everyday life			0
the research found that the most commonly occurring themes in the dreams included cars the volunteers were also asked to view images of items that they often dreamed about , such as computers , as their brains were scanned for a second time the volunteers were then asked to view images of the most commonly - occurring themes , such as ' car ' , ' man ' , ' woman ' and ' computer ' , as their brains were scanned again			1
it enabled the scientists to identify patterns in three parts of the brain , which processes what the eye sees			0
they also found that activity in a number of other areas of the brain , which have a particular focus on visual processing , varied according to the dreams			2
@entity72 of the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity3 , told @entity73 : ' by analysing the brain activity during the nine seconds before we woke the subjects , we could predict whether a man is in the dream or not , for instance , with an accuracy of 75 to 80 per cent			2

@entity3 researchers analysed the dreams of three men over several days
the volunteers ' dreams were mostly mundane , with the most common themes including cars , women and computers
the study found that activity in certain areas of the brain is the same whether a person is awake or asleep
