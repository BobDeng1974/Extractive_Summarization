but now @entity34 and @entity35 describe ' beautiful , happy baby '			0
her head , still significantly larger than it should be , has decreased to such an extent that she is able to move it , and open her eyes			2
although it is still painful for the little girl to lift her head up , she is described as ' playful ' by her young parents and has become the ' centre of attention ' of her village			2
unable to pay for their child 's treatment , pictures were circulated by various news organisations , and a charity came forward to offer help			0
@entity78 students , @entity79 and @entity80 , started an online campaign that raised $ 52,000 to help fund any further care needed			0

even though i had seen her pictures , i was n't expecting the head to be so big			0
' her head measures 94 cm , in similar cases the average measurement is around 50 - 60 cm. ' it is swollen to an extent that she is not able to close her eyes completely			2
we have an opthamologist looking at her eyes , so that there are no complications there			0
' we are hopeful that she will make a complete recovery			0
the challenge is to drain her brain fluid in a gradual manner , so as the brain gets used to it			2
' @entity35 said : ' when she was born , i wondered why do children of poor people like us suffer this fate ? ' why is fate cruel to us ? why do rich people who can afford to cure their kids never get diseases like this ? @entity4 pictured before the operation			1
the skin on her head was pulled so tight across her face she could barely close her eyes her parents @entity34 and @entity35 now describe ' beautiful , happy baby '			1
