suddenly it feels a little like @entity1 in women ’s tennis , that the game might be starting to bloom again after a long spell spent in the the long shadow cast by their male counterparts			1
it seems we may be arriving at a point in the cycle when renewal is setting in with some exciting new blood about to reinvigorate what has remained , despite a relative lack of stars in recent years , a hugely successful form of women ’s sport			1
over on the men ’s tour you sense a slight trepidation about how things will be when , inevitably , the golden generation of present starts to fade away in the next few years			2
all set : @entity28 leaves @entity29 following a practice session with coach @entity31 ( left ) not so with their female counterparts , which is welcoming an assortment of new names and personalities who are going to challenge for the highest honours , quite possibly as soon as this @entity40			1
it was a huge blow for women ’s tennis that as intriguing a figure as @entity44 immediately retired after last year ’s championships , going the same way as marquee figures such as @entity48 and @entity49 , who have been hard to replace			1
there are a host of relative newcomers to look out for this year with different playing styles and blessedly barely a grunt between them			0
while not all will make it to the very top , some are sure to go all the way in the next few years			0
and , unlike in the men ’s game , a healthy handful of the brightest represent what is still the game ’s key market , @entity66			2
@entity67 has the startlingly grown - up @entity68 while @entity66 has the long identified @entity69 , the fresh new talent of teenager @entity71 and the player who some cognoscenti feel could be the best of all , @entity78 champion @entity76			1
coming to the fore : @entity67 's @entity68 has reached the semi-finals at the @entity82 and @entity83 opens rising star : @entity85 teenager @entity76 celebrates after winning the @entity86 in @entity78 @entity68 excelled at the recent @entity87 , as did beaten finalist @entity88 of @entity89 and the athletic @entity92 - @entity91 @entity90			1
@entity83 ’s @entity93 is another of whom great things have been predicted and we might be saying the same of @entity96 , if only she could manage a sustained spell free of injuries			0
opportunities will be coming with the top two seeds – @entity28 and @entity101 – both 32 , while there is plenty of mileage on the clock already for @entity106 , despite her being only 27			1
@entity44 was the second surprise @entity108 in three years , after the triumph of @entity110 in 2011			0
eight of the last fourteen grand slams have been won by different women , a situation that contrasts sharply with the locked - out men ’s game - only six on the victor ’s podium from the last 37 majors			1
on form : @entity89 's @entity88 recently reached her first @entity122 final at the @entity87 the most dominant player has been the younger @entity28 sister and there is no question that her best level is still superior to anyone , even @entity106 , who she could meet in the quarter finals in the tougher top half of the draw			1
however there are signs that the surge she has enjoyed following her 30th birthday , which coincided with her hooking up with @entity83 coach @entity31 , may be running out of momentum			0
in three of the last four majors she has gone out of the fourth round or earlier , having won three out of the four that preceded them			1
perhaps it has been physical or a fractional drop in motivation – quite understandable as , like her almost direct contemporary @entity147 , she approaches her 33rd birthday			0
major win : @entity28 celebrates with the @entity151 trophy after beating @entity152 in the final in 2013 the tendency to implode is making the biggest titles harder to come by , and serves only to encourage the others			1
as one leading coach observed of her : ' sometimes it seems as if she can not really beat up an opponent then she gets frustrated and is not prepared to hang in there like she used to			0
' last year saw some rare carnage in the women ’s draw with many of the big names struggling with their footwork early on			1
by the time we got to the semi-finals the players left were ranked 4 ( @entity170 ) 15 ( @entity44 ) , 20 ( @entity171 ) and 23 ( @entity172 )			0
the weather has been warmer and drier in this year ’s build up and this may add up to more assured performances from the top eight seeds			0
any slips ups this time and there is a queue formed of the younger generation itching to take advantage			0
@entity183 ( 1887 ) the youngest ever ladies singles champion , ‘ @entity187 ’ won the title aged 15			0
@entity188 ( 1997 ) at 16 , the youngest @entity40 singles champion in the modern era			0
also the youngest ever winner of the girls title , aged 13			0
young gun : @entity194 's @entity188 won @entity40 at the age of 16 in 1997 3			2
@entity106 ( 2004 ) the 17 - year - old @entity106 beat @entity28 in the final			1
@entity68 remembers watching that day : ‘ i thought what she was doing was so cool , and i wanted to do the same thing			2
@entity199 ( 2000 ) a 20 - year old @entity28 dropped only one set on the way to the first of her five @entity40 crowns			2
first - time triumph : @entity199 celebrates after winning the first of five @entity40 titles in 2000 5			0
@entity207 ( 1988 ) in one of the greatest seasons in tennis history , @entity208 won the @entity212 ( all four majors and the @entity214 ) at the age of 19 .			2

the women 's game is welcoming an assortment of new names and personalities
marquee figures such as @entity49 and @entity48 have been hard to replace
@entity68 , @entity69 and @entity76 are some exciting *prospects*
@entity28 has been *knocked* out of the fourth round or earlier in three of the last four majors
