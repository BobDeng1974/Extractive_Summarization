controversial : @entity26 leader @entity11 with wife @entity12 , who is k representing both toxic waste exporters and travellers who set up an illegal camp ms @entity12 , whose legal work earns her an estimated £ 200,000 a year , was attempting to block criminal charges against her clients			1
the case was the culmination of @entity36 , the codename given to the @entity39 ’s unprecedented prosecution of 15 individuals and companies for shipping waste from the electronics industry to the @entity45 country			2
the agency said it had mounted the prosecution – the largest ever of its kind – because @entity50 law bans exporting such waste as it ‘ risks harm to human health and the environment in the recipient country ’ through unsafe disposal methods , such as burning plastic			1
@entity25 has been described as ‘ the world ’s pc dumping ground ’ , with up to 50 million tons of old computers thrown away each year on waste dumps			1
children earn about £ 1.30 a day scavenging on the dumps , putting their health at risk as old computers can contain toxins such as mercury , nickel , cadmium , chromium and lead			0
and research from a @entity25 university has warned of a ‘ chemical timebomb ’ as toxins from dumps seep into the water table			1
ms @entity12 ’s defence case rested on claiming that @entity50 laws on waste export were incompatible with @entity83 ones – but the subsequent trial found that the @entity86 laws had been breached			2
in his 2011 conference speech , mr @entity11 pledged that @entity26 would use higher taxes to punish ‘ predator ’ companies with a ruthless attitude to capitalism			2
des res : the @entity11 's £ 2m house ms @entity12 has also acted for @entity95 , an @entity97 traveller who illegally set up a caravan site on @entity101 land in @entity102 , when he used the @entity22 in a failed bid to block attempts to remove him			1
mr @entity11 provoked fury in no 10 by citing @entity4 ’s wealth in his attack on the prime minister for cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p			2
‘ @entity4 is n’t just writing the cheques			0
he is receiving one , ’ the @entity26 leader said			0
‘ he ’s going to be getting the millionaires ’ tax cut			2
’ mr @entity11 and his wife live with their two children in a four - bedroom house in an affluent @entity7 area , which they bought for £ 1.6 million three years ago			0
