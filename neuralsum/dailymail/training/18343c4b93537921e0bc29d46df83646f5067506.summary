by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 held a secret ‘ ski summit ’ in the @entity7 with a long - term ally who has called for @entity4 to be replaced as the @entity5 leader			1
mr @entity2 was spotted at the exclusive resort of @entity9 enjoying a £ 3,000 break with @entity5 peer @entity11 , who is widely regarded in @entity12 as the unofficial ‘ campaign chief ’ for the 70 - year - old cabinet minister			1
the @entity16 get - together is bound to reignite speculation about the business secretary ’s undimmed ambition to succeed mr @entity4 as leader if the party performs poorly in next year ’s election			1
business secretary @entity2 ( left ) held a secret ' ski summit ' in the @entity7 with his long - term ally , @entity5 peer @entity11 ( right ) who has called for @entity4 to be replaced as leader of the party mr @entity2 , who was accompanied by his wife , @entity26 , spent the week in a £ 410 - a - night suite at @entity28 , which boasts a swimming pool , jacuzzi and a gym as well as direct access to the slopes			1
former @entity34 spokesman @entity11 was seen there huddled in conversation with @entity2 and @entity37			2
the cabinet minister was forced to distance himself from @entity11 last september after he said mr @entity4 ’s ratings were ‘ very poor and have been for a long time ’ – the latest in a long line of his anti-clegg interventions			1
he added : ‘ we need to face facts , there ’s quite a lot of complacency going on and self - delusion going on			0
we are likely to lose seats			0
’ @entity11 then compared the deputy prime minister to @entity51 – the former @entity52 leader who led his party to a crushing @entity55 defeat in 1983			2
the @entity16 get - together in the @entity7 resort of @entity9 is likely to reignite speculation about the business secretary 's undimmed ambition to succeed mr @entity4 as leader if the party performs poorly at next year 's election during the interview , he also indicated that mr @entity2 would be the best candidate to take over as leader			1
mr @entity2 claimed at the time that he found the remarks ‘ seriously unhelpful ’ , while mr @entity4 said the peer appeared ‘ like clockwork ’ every year to make similar criticisms			2
he added : ‘ when it ’s conference and the weather turns bad , up pops @entity11 with some disobliging remarks about me			0
’ @entity11 compared mr @entity4 to @entity51 - the former @entity52 leader who led his party to a crushing @entity55 defeat in 1983 @entity9 is part of the @entity74 , which is the largest ski complex in the world			1
it is a hotspot for celebrities and @entity79 , including prince @entity80 and the @entity81 , who holidayed there in 2010			0
the resort , which is popular with wealthy @entity84 , is full of michelin - star restaurants and designer shops			0
chancellor @entity87 found himself facing criticism three years ago when he took his family on an £ 11,000 ski trip to @entity91 after telling the public that ‘ we ’re all in this together ’			0
but mr @entity2 took time out of his own skiing break to urge the chancellor to introduce a vat cut for homeowners trying to repair flood damage			0
the move , which could cost the @entity34 £ 150 million , was viewed as another attempt by the @entity5 to distance themselves from their @entity102 partners as next year ’s @entity103 draws closer			0
last night mr @entity2 went out of his way to stress that @entity11 was with him on the skiing trip as an old friend – not as his political spokesman			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ there ’s a lot of difference between expressing distinct political views and personal friendships which go back for many years			0
’ he added that as well as @entity11 and his wife , the skiing party also included @entity5 peer @entity115 and ‘ other people ’			1
later , aides for mr @entity2 insisted that ‘ @entity11 does not speak for @entity2 ’ and said mr @entity2 had met the costs of his holiday out of his own pocket .			2

@entity2 met with @entity5 peer @entity11 in @entity9 , @entity124
the get - together is likely to reignite speculation about the business secretary 's ambition to succeed @entity4 as leader of the party
