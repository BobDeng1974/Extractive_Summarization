by allowing only the best eggs or embryos to be selected for @entity4 , the @entity1 test is expected to slash the odds of miscarriage and greatly boost the chances of a woman having a healthy baby a three - in - one test that could almost guarantee the chance of having a baby could be available within months			1
by allowing only the best eggs or embryos to be selected for @entity4 , the @entity1 test is expected to slash the odds of miscarriage and greatly boost the chances of a woman having a healthy baby			1
this would cut the financial and emotional costs of trying time after time to start a family			1
@entity4 costs between £ 3,000 and £ 15,000 a course , but success is far from guaranteed			1
just one in four of the 40,000 women who have it each year have a baby			1
the test 's inventor , @entity29 , said : ' it offers the possibility of enhancing success rates of @entity4 , allowing couples to more rapidly get to the point of having a child and avoids the heartbreak of miscarriage and termination of pregnancies affected by serious disorders			1
' the new technique builds on an existing test called array comparative genomic hybridisation ( @entity45 ) which counts the number of chromosomes in an egg or embryo			2
healthy eggs should have 23 chromosomes and embryos 46 , but many have more or less than this , greatly increasing the risk of miscarriage and of having a child with a condition such as @entity60 's syndrome			0
up to three - quarters of miscarriages are thought to be due to embryos having the wrong number of chromosomes , with eggs from older women particularly likely to be defective			2
' @entity67 ' results released two years ago revealed array @entity45 to more than double a woman ’s odds of getting pregnant			0
now , the technique ’s pioneer dr @entity29 is trying to make it even better by bolting on two other checks			0
he told the @entity76 ’s annual conference that one involves counting the number of mitochondria – the tiny ‘ batteries ’ inside cells that turn the food we eat into energy			0
the other involves checking structures called telomeres			0
these are tiny biological clocks that cap the ends of chromosomes , protecting them from damage , much like the caps on the ends of shoelaces prevent fraying			0
studies suggest that short or fraying telomeres can make the difference between ‘ life or death ’ for an embryo			0
dr @entity29 said testing for three defects rather than one could take the @entity4 success rate from the 80 per cent or so of array @entity45 to approaching 100 per cent			1
‘ we hope to fill in that gap and get closer to getting a successful pregnancy from every @entity4 cycle			1
’ he added that his test wo n’t help women whose pregnancies fail because of problems with the womb			2
but this is not a major cause of @entity4 failure and other researchers are working on ways of getting round it			1
dr @entity29 plans to make it available to around 15 @entity123 ivf clinics within weeks			0
however , initially , only the chromosome data will be used when deciding which embryos to use in @entity4			2
after around six months , he will look at the telomere and mitochondria data taken from the embryos at the time and see whether it also helped predict the women ’s odds of becoming pregnant			2
if so , he plans to make the full three - in - one test available to @entity123 clinics			0
it will only be available privately initially and is expected to add around £ 2,000 to the cost of @entity4 , the same as array @entity45			1
the @entity138 has previously cautioned against the use of array @entity45 until there is large - scale data on how well it works .			0

financial cost of trying to start a family would be cut
only quarter of 40,000 women who currently have @entity4 succeed
