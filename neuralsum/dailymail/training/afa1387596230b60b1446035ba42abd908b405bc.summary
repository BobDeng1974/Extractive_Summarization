by @entity0 published : 22:06 est , 7 august 2012 updated : 22:21 est , 8 august 2012 political junkies are chomping at the bit for the latest insights into @entity5 's vice presidential pick , and there was a glimmer of hope tuesday morning when it was suggested that the public could turn to @entity10 for answers			1
a site called @entity14 president made a compelling case by arguing that interested parties could look at the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees and use the volume of those edits as a gauge for how likely it is that said candidate will be @entity5 's choice			1
the article examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential election : shortly before @entity33 and @entity34 were revealed as their respective parties ' vice presidential nominees , there was a major spike in the edits to their pages			1
frontrunner : seen here with @entity5 today , @entity42 senator @entity41 ( right ) had the most edits on her @entity10 out of all of the potential vp candidates the jump in that traffic presumably came from members of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by @entity55 hoping to learn more about the candidates			1
for instance , @entity33 's page had 68 edits the day before her nomination was announced , while other prospects - which , at the time , included @entity5 himself - had far fewer changes on that fateful day			2
the activity increase was first noticed immediately after the @entity33 nomination , but today 's article appears to be the first time that such analysis was applied to this year 's crop of candidates			0
using the same barometer , a number of political bloggers looked to see if that same detail - specific timeline could give some insights into the upcoming @entity77 nominee selection process			0
trailing behind : @entity79 had 100 edits on tuesday ( left ) , @entity78 had 81 ( center ) and @entity82 had 57 ( right ) putting them all behind @entity41 but the system of analysis is also flawed while senators @entity78 and @entity79 have often been discussed as the frontrunners in the secretive race , they were outpaced - at least on @entity10 - by senator @entity41 on tuesday			1
the @entity42 senator , who has campaigned frequently with @entity5 in recent months , had a total of 153 edits made to her page by tuesday evening , while @entity79 followed with 100 and @entity78 with 81			1
@entity82 finished out the list with 57 edits			2
@entity97 blogger @entity96 said that while he initially endorsed the validity of the veritable ' tea leaves ' of @entity10 edits , further inspection proved that a number of the edits were done by the same sources , not all of which were substantive			2
additionally , there is the ever - important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation			0
when @entity33 was added to the ticket , she was essentially unknown to all @entity55 outside of @entity112 where she was part - way through her first term			0
as a result , it comes as no surprise that @entity119 's campaign staff wanted to add a significant amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of the electorate			0
trendsetters : the system of looking through @entity10 edits for clues came with @entity33 's selection in 2008 ( above ) but she also was less well - known than all of @entity5 's current candidates the same can not be said for @entity79 , @entity78 or @entity41 , all of whom have been under the political microscope for the past few months in wake of their connections to @entity5			1
while the edit tally may not prove to be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot , the @entity5 campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which will deliver the news first once it breaks			2
another tried - and - tested method would be to follow the money			0
@entity97 reported tuesday that @entity78 is expected to rake in over $ 500,000 for the @entity5 ticket from two @entity148 fundraisers this week , which would be a positive argument in favor of his candidacy			0
at the same time , @entity154 - based @entity77 @entity153 coordinator @entity152 tweeted an anonymous tip that the @entity5 ’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential partner will be in @entity158 , foreshadowing that the candidate is likely from the @entity154 , ( meaning @entity79 )			1
it is likely that such rumor - mongering will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal announcement wo n’t come until after the @entity165 finish in order to make the best use of the inevitable media attention .			0

in the days leading up to public announcements , vice presidential candidate 's @entity10 pages are frequently updated by campaign staffers
@entity42 senator @entity41 has the *highest* number ( 153 ) of edits out of all of @entity5 's *possibilities* ; *coincides* with joint appearance today
@entity79 had 100 edits , @entity78 had 81 and @entity82 had 57
