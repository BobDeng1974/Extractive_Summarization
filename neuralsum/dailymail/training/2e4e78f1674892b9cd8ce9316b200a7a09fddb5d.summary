the man who holds the secrets of @entity4 leader @entity3 ’s finances was reported last night to be in hiding in @entity5 after fleeing for his life from @entity3 ’s rule			1

two other aides to @entity10 were reportedly executed in recent months for corruption			2
it is believed the firing squad deaths prompted the unnamed defector to flee to @entity5 and make contact with the @entity22 embassy in @entity23			0
purges : @entity10 , left , was recently ousted from his position by his nephew @entity4 leader @entity3 , right			1
it has emerged that the aide responsible for handling @entity10 's finances has now fled to @entity5 the defection was reported today by @entity22 media who said its agents were holding the aide in a secret location in @entity5			1
the news came as separate reports in @entity22 suggested that @entity3 was preparing to purge his ailing aunt , @entity10 's estranged wife , @entity38			1
it is believed that @entity3 is planning to replace the 65 - year - old , who plays a supporting role in his regime but is rumoured to be battling cancer , alcoholism and depression linked to the suicide of her daughter , with his younger sister			2
@entity51 , a professor at @entity53 's @entity52 and an authority on @entity4 affairs , told @entity56 : ' [ @entity3 ] is trying to bring in a younger generation of decision - makers and has kicked out the older ones , which is causing a lot of problems in the elite in @entity64			1
' mr @entity51 added : ' he has been able to do that in the party and the bureaucracy , but he does not have the power to do that with the military			0
' @entity3 's moves to replace many of the senior officials who served his father are apparently an attempt to shore up his rule with younger henchmen loyal to his regime			2
@entity78 @entity77 said the defector who escaped to @entity5 managed funds for ‘ uncle @entity10 ’ , whose marriage to @entity3 ’s aunt and proximinity to the leader of two years made him one of the most powerful men in @entity4			1

the man not only had knowledge of the uncle ’s finances , but also those of @entity3 and his late father , former leader @entity96			2

the @entity3 family is feared throughout the country of 25million , where the current @entity3 , his father and grandfather @entity3 , have ruled with an iron fist			1
the family has shown its ruthlessness in protecting its privacy with a series of executions or banishment to labour camps , so a defection by a top aide would be regarded as a disaster			0
what secrets does he hold ? the defector is believed to have been responsible for handling @entity10 's finances and in turn is believed to have intimate knowledge of the 32 - year - old leader ¿ s financial affairs the fleeing man will need extreme protection for the rest of his life if he succeeds in gaining asylum in @entity22 - @entity4 agents will have made him a number one target for assassination			1
a spokesman for the @entity135 , @entity136 , said : ‘ we have noted the report but do not understand the situation			0
’ however , @entity23 is a close ally of @entity64 and rarely allows anyone fleeing from @entity4 to move on to a third country			0
@entity77 said the aide fled to @entity5 some time in late september or early october and the ‘ highly important catch ’ would have been given immediate protection			0
however , he still has to be moved from @entity5 to @entity22 , but the @entity22 ’s agents have become experts at carrying out successful human smuggling operations			0
initially , said the cable news network , the aide had tried to flee from @entity5 to @entity151 , a route used by other defectors , but his attempt was blocked by @entity5 agents			0
according to @entity77 , it is not only @entity22 which wants to sit down with the aide and listen to all he can tell them about the finances - and other matters - of @entity3			2
the @entity162 has also asked for custody of him - or at the very least access to debrief him .			0
