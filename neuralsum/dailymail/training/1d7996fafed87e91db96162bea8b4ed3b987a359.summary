by @entity0 published : 08:50 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 11:53 est , 20 march 2013 a @entity2 factory implicated in the horse meat scandal was today embroiled in fresh controversy after health inspectors found 57 tons of banned @entity7 mutton there			1
veterinary scientists said that the meat was obtained by an illegal mechanical process which sees it mixed with bone marrow			1
it has been banned in @entity13 since the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , or ‘ @entity14 ’ crisis			0
despite strict export controls , the 57 tons of mutton were found at the @entity19 factory in @entity20 , near @entity21 , in south - west @entity2			1
in trouble : 57 tons of banned @entity7 mutton have been found at the @entity19 factory in @entity2 the company was today blaming unscrupulous @entity7 exporters for trying to pass off the illegal meat as ordinary mutton which could be used in sausages and other products			1
@entity19 has already been found guilty of handling horse meat from @entity31 labelled as beef which eventually found its way on to supermarket shelves in the @entity7			1
now @entity35 , the prosecutor of @entity36 , said the mutton could have carried diseases into the human food chain			0
‘ the process and the sale of such meat is banned in @entity13 , ’ said mr @entity35 after an analysis was carried out by the @entity41 in @entity42			0
this was the same organisation which analysed horse meat during last month ’s crisis , finding it prevalent in all kinds of food products			2
@entity19 , which employs 300 people , is already facing criminal action over its part in the horse meat scandal			1
it was temporarily closed for business by the @entity2 government for selling 750 tons of horse as beef , but was then controversially allowed to reopen			2
the @entity14 crisis in @entity7 saw the @entity64 ban @entity7 beef exports for 10 years from march 1996			2
it led to numerous restrictions on certain types of meat exporters , including mechanically produced mutton			2
controversy : the factory was previously caught up in the @entity13 horse meat scandal sheep marrow has been associated with @entity75 , a fatal degenerative disease that affects the nervous systems of sheep and goats			1
it is one of several spongiform encephalopathies which are related to @entity14 , which can be easily transmitted to humans by eating food contaminated with the brain , spinal cord or digestive tract of infected carcasses			0
@entity89 , the ceo of @entity19 , said that his company had ‘ once again , been fooled by its supplier			0
’ @entity14 , known as @entity14 or @entity14 , was discovered in thousands of @entity7 cattles in the mid- 1990s			0
it causes the fatal disease @entity95 , which killed dozens of people after they ate infected beef			0
in march 1996 , the export of @entity7 beef was banned in an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease			0
three years later some of the restrictions were lifted , but it was not until 2006 that beef and live cattle could be freely exported around @entity13			0
however , because of the increased risk posed by bone marrow , its export from the @entity7 is still banned			1
unions at the @entity19 plant in @entity20 had lobbied president @entity116 ’s government for the return of their meat handling licence following the horse meat scare last month			1
despite clear evidence of fraud , the @entity120 allowed it to start trading again			0
the @entity19 horse meat is believed to have been used in 4.5million ready - made meals in 13 @entity13 countries , including the @entity7			1
the separation process can allow muscles , nerves and bone marrow to enter the food chain			2
it is banned for sheep , cattle and goats in @entity13 because of the potential presence of @entity75 and @entity14 in the animal parts removed			0
food minister @entity138 said : ‘ as a preventative measure we have ordered the recall of all products made from the meat ’			0
@entity19 said that the frozen meat arrived in two lots from a @entity7 supplier , and was mainly due to be used in merguez sausages and charcuterie			1
it suggested that the illegal meat had started off in the @entity7 and been passed through a wholesaler in the @entity153			1
a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ the meat should not have left the @entity7			2
it is not our fault			0
’ the illegal @entity7 mutton was shipped through a @entity153 trader which is already under investigation over the horse meat scandal			1
@entity163 bought horse meat from @entity31 abattoir @entity165 , which is known to have sold horse cuttings that eventually ended up in @entity7			1
one of @entity163 ’s customers main customers is @entity19 , to whom it also supplied the @entity7 mutton			2
shipping documents show it was transported to a cold storage warehouse used by @entity163			0
a @entity2 @entity176 spokesman said the offending mutton was labelled as ‘ minced lamb ’			1
on the basis of these documents , @entity19 could not have known that the meat had been cut using a technique prohibited in the @entity64 since 2001 , said a spokesman			2
@entity163 is already at the centre of a criminal investigation in @entity186			0
experts believe a fraudster has been passing off horse filler as beef because it costs four times less			0
but under @entity153 regulations , if a company is found to have deliberately passed off horse meat as beef the maximum fine is just £ 880 .			1

@entity19 factory was *accused* of exporting horse meat to the @entity7
57 tons of mutton mixed with bone marrow found at @entity2 *facility*
firm blames discovery on @entity153 *importer* which provided ' minced lamb '
