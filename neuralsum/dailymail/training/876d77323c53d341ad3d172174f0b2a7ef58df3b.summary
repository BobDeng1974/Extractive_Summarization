by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:30 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 08:52 est , 20 april 2012 a male member of @entity3 has used a spreadsheet to make sure he was able to distinguish between each of the eight women he was dating			1
@entity7 , a 28 - year - old investment banker from @entity8 , used the @entity10 tool to record details of each of the women 's characteristics as well as progress reports on how his dates with them went			1
@entity7 told @entity18 he emailed the spreadsheet to @entity20 , a woman he had dated , after their april 4 meeting because she ' worked with spreadsheets a lot too			1
' @entity20 then forwarded the document to a group of her friends two days later which helped turn the document viral			1
@entity7 , who works for real - estate finance firm @entity28 , wrote to @entity20 : ' well , this could be a mistake , but what the hell ... figured i might as well give you the whole thing			1
i hope this email does n't backfire , because i really had a great time and hope to hang again soon : ) ' order : @entity7 , a @entity3 online dater from @entity8 , made a spreadsheet ( pictured in part above ) to keep track of the eight women he had been dating perhaps most concerning was that @entity7 passed on the information without removing the girls ' telephone numbers , email addresses , full names or details about their dates , such as how he scored their appearances			1
@entity51 has blurred out this personal information to protect the girls ' identities			1
@entity20 then emailed her friends : ' wanted to pass this on to you for some monday morning entertainment			2
i went on a date with this guy last wednesday			0
' on the date , he tells me that he has a spreadsheet for tracking all of the people from @entity3 that are ' in process			1
' naturally , i tease him and ask him to send me the spreadsheet			2
for some strange reason , he actually does			0
just when i thought i had seen it all ... ' the spreadsheet was split into various categories including ' monitor closely ' and ' monitor casually ' columns			2
it detailed sent text messages and email exchanges as well as the venues in which @entity76 and his date met			2
leaked : @entity7 emailed the spreadsheet to one of his dates who forwarded it to her friends , adding : ' just when i thought i 'd seen it all ' the document detailed his thoughts on the women 's physical appearances , giving each a score out of ten , with some being awarded a 7.0 or 7.5 for their ' mixed bag of pictures ' on the website			1
arranged in alphabetical order , @entity20 , the woman he sent the email to , is top of the list			2
not concerned with playing it cool , he failed to remove his thoughts on her including : ' @entity100 to see again soon '			0
judging by her message as she forwarded the spreadsheet to her friends , it now seems unlikely			1
and even though he hoped to see her again , he did not think to remove flattering details about his other dates including top scores for appearances , and the fact he 'd ' hooked up ' with one of the girls at a party			0
another entry reads : ' ok girl , but very jappy ' , a slang word for ' jewish american princess '			0
and for a man who treats women so well he deems it appropriate to make a spreadsheet just to remember their names , home towns and first dates , it is perhaps unsurprising that he wrote how one stood him up , claiming a friend was in hospital			1
in a second page , he lists the women he has met through friends , rather than the dating website			1
with these women , he had the forethought to remove their identities			2
he added in the email to @entity20 : ' i only deleted the non-match people 's names ( at the bottom ) since some i 've known for a long time			2
' @entity7 told @entity18 he regrets making the spreadsheet , labelling it ' an extraordinarily dumb decision '			1
he then explained his thought process			0
he said : ' i work with spreadsheets a lot ... it 's a great additional tool			2
i work long days , go to the gym , go out on a couple of midweek dates or what not , get home late ... how am i going to remember them ? i 'm not			0
' so i made the spreadsheet			0
my comments are n't malicious or mean			0
this was an honest attempt to stay organised			0
' serial dater : dating @entity76 ( who is not the man pictured in this photo ) felt too time - starved to not keep a spreadsheet , he said @entity7 told the @entity161 that he was sorry for making the document			1
' i sincerely regret my serious lapse in judgment in this matter and apologise to everyone , ' he said			1
' i am deeply remorseful			0
' @entity7 awarded his highest score for appearance , a 9.5 , to @entity170 , who he described as : ' looks beautiful ; from coastal @entity172 ; @entity174 make - up artist			1
' but he added : ' @entity176 may be back in the picture			1
' speaking to @entity51 , @entity170 admitted that this is a line she gives men when she is not interested			1
even though @entity7 was ' a really nice guy who wanted to get serious about a girl ' , she said she was just too busy to continue contacting him			1
the 26 - year - old , who never met @entity7 in person , insisted it was nothing he had done wrong - adding that she does not even blame him for making the spreadsheet			1
' he 's a smart guy and he want to keep track of everything , ' she said			0
' he wanted to make sure he was approaching the women correctly - they 're all beautiful girls			2
he 's a lucky guy			0
' yet she added that she did blame @entity20 for forwarding it to her friends			0
' i 'm blaming her , ' @entity170 said			0
he wanted to find a cool girl and was reaching out to her			0
i think she was uncool			0
' she could have removed my information - she could have at least removed my name			0
now my details are being posted all over blogs and my phone is ringing and ringing			0
i should send her my phone bill			0
' @entity170 said that she was flattered by @entity7 's description of her on the spreadsheet and the fact he had been ' persistent ' in calling her			1
she added that she is now in a committed relationship and will not be getting back in touch with him			0
she does feel sorry for the last girl on the spreadsheet though , who @entity7 said was ' jappy ' - slang for @entity211			1
the girl told @entity18 that @entity7 was ' fidgety ' when the pair met , adding : ' he got up to readjust himself a few times in the middle of our conversation , which was bizarre			1
he kept taking his glasses off and then putting them on again			0
' in reference to the tag , she said she thought it was funny he had called her that , despite being shocked he had kept a spreadsheet in the first place			0
she recalled @entity7 correctly identifying her designer handbag during their date , which probably led to the tag			2
' he said his mom had it , ' she said			0
speaking with the @entity161 , @entity7 added : ' suffice it to say , i will never do anything like this again			2

investment banker @entity7 *compiled* spreadsheet for eight women he met on @entity3
sent it to one of the women as ' she worked with spreadsheets too ' - but then she forwarded it to her friends
scored each woman out of 10 for appearance and noted every time they had been in contact
gave one a 9.5 for appearance but said ' old @entity176 may be back in the picture '
she told @entity51 that is just a line she gives men when she is not interested
@entity7 : ' i seriously regret my lapse in judgment '
