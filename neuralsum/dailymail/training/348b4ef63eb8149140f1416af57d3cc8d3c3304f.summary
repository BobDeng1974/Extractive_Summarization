' i did n't recognize that woman , ' @entity0 said on tuesday			2
' that was a woman in trauma and shock , trying to understand what had happened			0
the cold hard fact was that i probably should not have been here but perhaps under the care of a doctor			0
' after the show , she went home and thought about what had happened , she said			2

' that 's the beauty of what we 're doing now			0
we have total and complete control , ' she told the @entity176			0
