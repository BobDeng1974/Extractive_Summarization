by @entity0 published : 04:00 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 02:16 est , 14 august 2012 a small @entity2 lander being tested for missions to the moon and other destinations beyond @entity6 crashed and burned after veering off course during a trial run at the @entity8 yesterday			1
there were no injuries after the prototype , known as @entity12 but dubbed ' the beetle ' , burst into flames near the runway formerly used by @entity2 's space shuttles			2
the insect - like vehicle , designed and built by engineers at @entity2 's @entity19 in @entity20 , had made several flights attached to a crane before thursday 's attempted free - flight			1
but a few seconds later , @entity12 rolled over on its side and plummeted to the ground			2
@entity2 video showed the vehicle engulfed in flames and then rocked by a spectacular explosion , presumably due to the fuel tanks rupturing			1
' failures such as these were anticipated prior to the test , and are part of the development process for any complex spaceflight hardware , ' @entity2 said in a statement			2
an investigation is under way , the statement added			0
@entity12 began in partnership with privately owned @entity54 , which is developing re-usable , suborbital vehicles that take off and land vertically			0
@entity2 , which has spent about $ 7 million on the project over the past two and a half years , is interested in developing technologies that could be used to fly cargo to the moon and other future missions beyond @entity6 orbit			1
the @entity8 was used up until recently for space shuttle launches @entity12 was an example of what the former project manager called ' @entity68 engineering ' - low - budget projects that use existing resources and partner with non-traditional aerospace companies			1
' the @entity12 lander is kind of our poster child			0
it 's one of our first attempts to do these kinds of projects , ' former project manager @entity77 said in an interview with @entity83 last year			0
' instead of building some elaborate test structure , you go to @entity68 and build something very quickly that gets you 80 percent of the answer and allows you to keep moving forward , ' he said			0
the @entity8 is symbolic to the world 's biggest space agency @entity12 arrived at @entity91 's seaside space center in july for three months of increasingly rigorous test flights , including automated landings in a mock moonscape , complete with craters and boulders			1
the lander was designed to deliver about 1,100 pounds ( 500kg ) of cargo to the moon , @entity2 said on its @entity12 website			2
technologies being developed include a propulsion system that uses liquid oxygen and methane -- green fuels that could be manufactured on other planetary bodies , @entity2 said			0
the accident happened as @entity2 scientists were still hailing the @entity110 's descent and landing on the @entity111 earlier this week as a ' miracle of engineering			0
