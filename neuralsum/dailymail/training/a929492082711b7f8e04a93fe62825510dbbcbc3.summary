@entity0 , @entity1 ’s most highly rated young tennis talent , has dispensed with @entity2 as his head coach after less than six months following a recent slump in form			1
the 19 year - old from @entity7 , who is currently in @entity9 , has ended the high profile arrangement and is said to have opted for now to concentrate on working with his other coach , @entity11			1
@entity0 has lost five consecutive first rounds and is believed to have concluded that @entity2 ’s other commitments will prevent him from putting in the necessary time at this key stage of his development			2
promising teenager @entity0 has split from coach @entity2 ( @entity17 ) after a slump in form @entity0 has slumped to five consecutive first round defeats in a row this year the split is something of an embarrassment to @entity26 chief executive @entity25 and an early blow to recently appointed player development director @entity28 , both of who were enthusiastic promoters of @entity2 ’s role with the former outstanding junior			1
more profoundly , it is yet another example of how the centralised @entity26 system , with its inevitable political complications and vested interests , so often seems to hinder rather than help the production of elite players in @entity1			0
@entity0 has looked the brightest prospect of a highly promising cluster of @entity1 juniors who a few years ago looked to have a good future , only to hit problems when trying to make the senior ranks with a depressing predictability			2
former @entity49 junior champion @entity48 , who got through a bewildering number of coaches from the @entity26 and elsewhere , is currently on an indefinite career break and may not return , while ex @entity54 winner @entity53 largely restricts himself to doubles			1
former @entity1 no 1 @entity2 is believed to have too many other commitments on his plate @entity0 is the latest in a line of @entity1 juniors struggling to make the step up to the seniors @entity62 , one time junior @entity63 finalist , endured a major struggle for two years , although he has bounced back impressively this summer is now doing the best of them , currently ranked 235 in the world and the @entity1 no 4			1
he is seven places above @entity0 , whose past form had him projected to have advanced to around 150 at this point but has slipped behind the best of his international contemporaries			0
in april , @entity25 enthusiastically declared that @entity2 had asked to be ‘ given the keys ’ to take @entity0 on , after the player split from his long standing coach @entity74 , under who he had been making solid enough upward progress			2
@entity1 youngster @entity62 has started to find his form again after struggling for two years both @entity25 and @entity28 wanted the @entity79 1 to have a more focussed role in his part - time contract with the governing body , despite being warned that prized youngsters require full - time dedicated coaches			2
@entity86 is known to have been among those deeply sceptical about the move			0
from the outset there were issues about the restraints on @entity2 ’s time and , in fairness , the former world no 4 never claimed he would be able to devote himself full - time to the youngster from @entity97 , due to such things as his broadcasting and corporate commitments			0
@entity74 has now left the @entity26 , ironically one of the few coaches to depart amid a general wave of redundancies that has been taking place there			0
@entity1 no 1 @entity86 ( @entity17 ) was sceptical about the move to bring in @entity2 on a part time basis @entity0 ’s stalled progress again suggests that , after its serial failures of recent decades , the governing body should distance itself as much as possible from the whole area of performance and outsource the process as much as possible to independent programmes at home and abroad			1
as a talented player with an impressively mature outlook and work ethic , @entity0 is comfortably young enough to kick on again and resume his climb up the rankings to fulfil the exciting promise he has shown before			0
but , unlike nations with far lesser riches , the @entity26 still show no sign of knowing how to get prized youngsters through the toughest transition of all , turning from them from talented juniors into successful professionals .			0

@entity0 has parted company with his coach @entity2
talented teenager did not think former @entity1 no 1 could spare enough time
the 19 - year - old has slumped to five first round defeats in succession
@entity1 youngsters @entity48 and @entity53 have also struggled
the split asks serious questions of @entity26 *'s* ability to groom juniors
