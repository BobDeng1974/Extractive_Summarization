a group of holidaymakers is suing an airline after a flight from @entity4 to @entity5 was delayed for 19 hours			0
hundreds of passengers were left stranded in @entity7 when an administrative error grounded flight @entity9			1
the jet was denied permission to fly through @entity14 airspace as some of the passengers ' passport details had not been entered into a database as required			1
stranded : @entity19 ( third from the left ) his wife ( second from left ) and their two grown - up daughters were returning from @entity4 when they were delayed for 19 hours passengers spent five hours at the airport in @entity7 as a result of the gaffe before being told the flight would not depart until the following day			1
they were put up in a local hotel and eventually landed at @entity5 some 19 hours late			0
@entity30 initially offered £ 10 compensation although later increased it to £ 100 per passenger			1
but some travellers - furious at the ' token ' original offer - believe new @entity36 rules on delayed flights entitles them to up to £ 500			2
administrative error : the @entity30 plane was not allowed to fly through @entity14 airspace as some passengers ' details had not been entered into a database as required among those taking action is @entity19 , 46 , who says the delay in november ruined his family 's £ 4,700 dream holiday			1
the council worker , who travelled with his wife and two children , 20 and 18 , said he had to fork out £ 45 for airport food as well as fund an extra stay in a kennel for his pet dog			2
passengers are also claiming for lost earnings			2
mr @entity19 said : ‘ @entity30 managed the situation terribly			1
it was only after over five hours that they offered us bottles of water and started to suggest that the flight probably would n't leave that night			2
‘ the whole experience was a nightmare and a terrible way to end what had been a fantastic holiday in @entity4			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity30 said : ' we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers travelling from @entity7 , @entity4 to @entity5 on flight @entity9 in november last year , after their flight was delayed			1
' she explained : ' @entity30 operates a fair and thorough process to deal with @entity77 in line with the regulation			1
the law in this area is complex and some situations will not result in an entitlement to compensation			2
long day : passengers were forced to wait at @entity86 for five hours before they were eventually told their plane would not depart until the following day finally home : @entity30 initially offered £ 10 compensation to delayed passengers , although later increased it to £ 100 per person ' the clause ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’ does encompass a number of eventualities , and this can include the failure of communication services operated by a third party , which in this instance resulted in the @entity14 authorities being temporarily unable to authorise these customers to fly through their airspace			1
this failure was beyond our control and is extremely rare			0
' the airline added : ' we ’d like to reassure customers that we are committed to maintaining an excellent on - time performance across our flying programme , and we work hard to maintain the title of most on - time charter airline			0
' as this case is now subject to legal proceedings we are unable to comment further			0
' the @entity115 , from @entity116 , and 20 other passengers who were on the delayed flight are being represented by law firm @entity119			0
solicitor @entity120 said : ‘ the way in which @entity30 have treated their passengers is appalling , as were their attempts to get off cheaply by flouting their responsibilities			1
’ but a spokesman for the airline said : ‘ we would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers after their flight was delayed			0
‘ the law is complex and some situations will not result in compensation			0
as this is subject to legal proceedings we are unable to comment further			0
