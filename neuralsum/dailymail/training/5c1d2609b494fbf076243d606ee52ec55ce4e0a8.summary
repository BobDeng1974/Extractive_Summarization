@entity0 have warned @entity1 off @entity2 and said they would be breaking @entity4 rules by trying to set up a loan deal			1
@entity1 wanted to explore the prospect of signing the @entity7 under 21 striker and allowing him to stay at @entity9 until the end of the season			0
such a move , however , would be in breach of @entity4 guidelines , as clubs are only allowed to loan out new signings to teams in the @entity18 or abroad , as @entity1 did with striker @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity1 are keen to sign @entity0 striker @entity2 during this january transfer window @entity2 ( right ) is also attracting interest from @entity23 but @entity0 have denied the deal @entity2 celebrates scoring away at @entity25 in november , but looks likely to leave @entity0 this year @entity2 is out of contract this summer and is not close to signing a new deal			1
@entity0 chief executive @entity28 took the unusual step of issuing a statement on friday in an attempt to end speculation about the 22 - year - old ’s future			1
‘ this type of move would violate @entity4 rule @entity37 regarding transfers , so simply can not happen , ’ said @entity28			0
‘ this is the last time we will be making any comment regarding the player ’s future			0
’ if @entity2 , who is also attracting interest from @entity45 and @entity23 , leaves in june , @entity0 will be entitled to a small amount of compensation			1
@entity48 understands the player is receptive to a move abroad and would welcome approaches from the @entity52 in @entity53			0
under @entity55 rules regarding young players , @entity0 would be entitled to compensation in that instance , but it is understood @entity45 would only be liable to pay £ 300,000 - leaving them plenty of room to offer a huge salary - while fellow @entity64 clubs could end up paying a fee 10 times that amount			2
@entity1 manager @entity67 does not expect many , if any departures , from his first - team squad before monday but he will allow 17 - year - old @entity70 to go out on loan			1
@entity1 boss @entity67 ( right ) is relishing the return of striker @entity73 @entity73 ( right ) has missed the majority of the season through injury , but is back training with the @entity77 @entity78 could make his 700th appearance for @entity1 and is third on the club ’s all - time list : @entity1 legends @entity83 857 @entity84 737 @entity78 699 * * correct as of january 30 , 2015 after @entity90 's success at @entity91 in the first half of the season , @entity70 , who has yet to make his senior debut but was on the bench for recent matches against @entity0 and @entity88 , is set for a temporary move to @entity18 strugglers @entity95			1
@entity67 , meanwhile , believes @entity78 may be the last entrant into an exclusive group			0
if the long - serving captain , who played all 120 minutes of @entity1 ’s @entity100 semi-final against @entity102 on tuesday , is involved in saturday ’s game with @entity104 at @entity105 , it will be his 700th appearance for the club			2
only @entity83 and @entity84 have reached that figure			0
@entity67 said : ‘ it ’s incredible			0
it will take some achievement by any player to do that again			0
’ @entity77 skipper @entity78 could make his 700th appearance for the @entity77 at the weekend @entity73 is expected to be included in the squad for @entity116 home clash with @entity104 @entity73 ( left ) played an integral role as @entity1 finished second in the @entity4 last season			2
