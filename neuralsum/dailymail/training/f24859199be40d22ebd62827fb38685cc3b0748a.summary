by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:59 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 19:34 est , 14 june 2012 anyone with any sympathy for the anti-capitalist movement may have been questioning their judgment yesterday			2
this was the appalling scene of squalor left by occupy protesters who camped out on a pretty @entity12 green to demonstrate against corporate greed			1
with no running water or adequate toilet facilities , they managed to leave a putrid assortment of rubbish , rotting food and even human waste			1
the camp at @entity24 , on the edge of @entity12 ’s financial district , began in october as an extension of the @entity27 ’s protest at @entity28			1
the squalid remains of the occupy protest camp at @entity24 in the @entity31 as the last members of the movement left yesterday leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill for the cleaning the camp pictured on tuesday before the moving began			1
it is estimated that the total cost to clean up the camps is going to exceed £ 100,000 but after 236 days of resistance , the protesters yesterday decided to call it a day and leave before bailiffs arrived			1
a court order earlier this month gave @entity47 the go - ahead to evict the group and most knew their time was up			2
sadly for local residents , the same protesters have now set up home a mile away in a family park			2
speaking from the new camp in @entity56 , east @entity12 – made up of as many @entity57 and @entity58 as @entity59 – one of the occupiers said : ‘ bailiffs are just thugs			1
rather than give them the pleasure of evicting us violently , we just moved on peacefully – and left them to clear up eight months of mess			1
’ the total cost to the taxpayer of moving the protesters is likely to exceed £ 100,000 , when legal fees and the clean - up are factored in			1
local businesses were delighted to see the back of them			0
@entity74 , of the @entity76 coffee shop , said the protest had cost his business almost £ 50,000 in lost revenue			2
he said : ‘ it ’s been hell these last few months			2
‘ it just descended into complete depravity and chaos			2
’ undeterred : a masked occupy protester surveys his new camp in @entity56 , east @entity12 , which was set up hours after police and bailiffs , evicted campaigners from @entity24 , north @entity12 occupy protestors , who were last night evicted from @entity24 in the @entity31 , have now set up a new camp in @entity56 the clear - out of the camp , made up of around 135 tents , started at 1am yesterday with no arrests taking place			1
council staff now face the unenviable task of removing the filth			0
the ground soil has become so contaminated the top six inches will have to be replaced for anything to grow			0
now residents of the trendy @entity56 face the prospect of a protracted fight to clear the area of the encampment , which started off with about ten tents but seems to have at least doubled in size by this afternoon			0
a @entity110 spokesman said : ' we are aware of tents pitched in @entity56			0
' officers are monitoring the situation but are not present at the scene			0
an appropriate policing plan is in place			0
' dozens of police officers and private security guards had taken several hours to clear anti-capitalist protesters from their north @entity12 camp after launching the swoop at 1am today			1
new camp : police were soon on the scene , but not before occupy protesters were about to erect around a dozen tents in @entity56 @entity129 but not so pleasant : @entity56 has now been taken over by the @entity131 protesters who descended on the site within hours of being evicted from @entity24 the camp was set up on the public land of the square in october , as an extension of the @entity27 ’s protest in @entity28 - which ended in eviction in february			1
today , @entity110 confirmed they were present at the scene which is being cleared by a private security company			0
two weeks ago a judge heard the protest had caused £ 20,000 damage to the land , cost the council £ 26,000 on security , and lost it £ 12,000 in rent plus income from the square ’s restaurant which had to close			1
there had been an adverse impact on local business and complaints about anti-social behaviour from the camp , which increasingly became a focus for the homeless , and which had no running water or sufficient toilet facilities			2
eviction : overnight enforcement officers cleared the remaining occupy protest camp in @entity12 's @entity24 battle over : two activists comfort each other looking past bailiffs into the campsite after @entity47 won a @entity171 battle over the land decision : two weeks ago a judge heard the protest had caused £ 20,000 damage to the land , cost the council £ 26,000 on security , and lost it £ 12,000 in rent plus income from the square ’s restaurant which had to close controlled operation : metal fencing is brought in to seal off the @entity24 during the eviction councillor @entity187 , @entity47 ’s executive member for community safety , said : ' @entity24 is public space for the people of @entity191 , one of @entity59 ’s most deprived boroughs			1
' we ’re returning the square to community use , and it is being cleaned and will soon be reopened to the public for the summer			2
' today ’s enforcement action was peaceful and low - key , and i ’d like to thank the police , our street outreach team , and other partner organisations for their help			1
' a number of vulnerable and homeless people have been living in the square			0
we have been speaking to them and offering advice and support to those who need assistance			0
' before protesters were evicted from the neighbouring camp at @entity28 in february , @entity24 was used as an overspill			1
it later became an ' eco village ' where sustainable technologies were showcased			0
but there was no sign of that now - the once pleasant park is now a barren , litter - strewn dump			0
occupy protesters had barricaded themselves into their camp on @entity24 in the @entity31 until last night 20 - 30 ' protestors ' remained at the @entity24 camp - eight months after it was first ' occupied ' @entity47 moved in march to start eviction proceedings against the ' residents ' of @entity24 @entity47 moved in march to start eviction proceedings against the ' residents ' of @entity24			1
but @entity230 , a resident at @entity24 , insists the camp serves an important purpose			0
he wrote on the @entity234 blog : ' this camp makes a political statement about our society			0
' since @entity27 opened the camp on 21 october , it has become a home and community for many homeless people , for whom the system has failed			0
' in evicting this community , @entity47 – who have helped to re-home some people that have ticked certain boxes – are potentially leaving some people in a much worse position than they are already in			0
' we ask @entity47 to not go down the same route at the @entity253 – cleansing the @entity253 of homeless people is not the way forward			0
helping to find real solutions is			0
' at one time protesters used the square to showcase sustainable technology , but it is now a litter strewn dump @entity47 claims the camp is now just occupied by vulnerable and homeless people banners erected on the camp preached anti-capitalist slogans , despite claims by councillors the square has become a haven for the homeless now the square has been repossessed @entity47 are keen to start fixing the damage caused by protesters			1

total bill for taxpayers will exceed £ 100,000
