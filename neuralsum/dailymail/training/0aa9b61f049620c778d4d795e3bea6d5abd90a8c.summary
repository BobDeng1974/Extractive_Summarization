by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 for @entity4 , the road to @entity3 has been a road to redemption			1
from a disappointing @entity8 debut , a big - money move that threatened to go awry and an unflattering cameo in sir @entity12 ’s autobiography , he has returned to @entity14 ’s plans with a timely late run			1
@entity4 ’s rapid progress and his midfield understanding with @entity19 captain @entity18 mean he is likely to play a vital role for @entity14 in @entity21			1
heading to @entity21 : @entity4 hopes to complete his road to redemption at the @entity24 @entity26 pair : @entity4 and @entity27 could like up for @entity8 together in @entity21 it would complete the circle neatly if he were to start the first group game against @entity31 in @entity32 , a year after he captained the country in a disastrous @entity34			1
‘ there was no dressing it up ; we did n’t do as well as we should have done , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i looked at myself and what i could ’ve done but quickly shifted focus on to helping @entity19 have a good season			1
’ he became a driving force in the team who pushed @entity44 closest for the title			0
many believe @entity19 would not have thrown the title away had @entity4 not missed three of the final four games after a red card against @entity44			1
going the distance : @entity4 and @entity18 helped @entity19 push for the title this season it was one more setback , but he is strong on the rebound			1
two years ago , as a late call - up for @entity56 , he suffered a tweet from @entity58 , who claimed : ‘ if @entity4 is in , any @entity59 not currently in the squad can feel aggrieved			1
’ then @entity12 questioned his peculiar gait and running style			0
‘ it was a bit strange , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ i did n’t buy the book but i read what it said and i took it as a bit of a compliment because he said he was watching me and thinking about buying me			0
’ @entity72 did n’t buy him but @entity19 paid £ 16million to @entity73 in 2011 , although @entity74 was prepared to sell him to @entity75 two years ago			2
if that move had gone through , @entity4 would have been preparing for the road to @entity78 in the championship			2
middle man : @entity4 could partner @entity18 in midfield for @entity8 there was advice and support from @entity18 and sessions with @entity19 sports psychiatrist @entity86 , who will be with the @entity8 squad in @entity21 , to rebuild his confidence			1
‘ in football you are going to have times where you have got to be strong , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i always believed i was good enough to be playing for @entity19 and @entity8			1
‘ going to @entity19 , you expect to play well every week and that was new for me , the hardest thing to deal with			2
the big players at @entity19 help you a lot but you have to deal with stuff on your own			2
’ over time he convinced @entity74			0
‘ i was performing well ; the gaffer just kept playing me , ' he said			0
despite not playing in the qualifying campaign , @entity14 picked him to start a friendly against @entity101 in march			0
it was his first full cap since his debut under @entity104 in 2010			2
‘ i was more mature , ’ he said			0
‘ i felt as if i ’d improved from then until @entity101			0
i was only 20 when i made my debut			0
it was a hard game			0
from then until @entity101 i felt as if i ’d improved			0
