@entity0 feels @entity1 have plenty of room for improvement despite making a perfect start to the new @entity6 season - but he is happy to take things ' step by step '			1
the @entity9 needed more than an hour to finally break down the resistance of a well - organised @entity12 side , looking to make their own statement after a decade out of the top flight			1
@entity0 had slammed his team as ' lazy ' in a first half which saw them create few chances , before they rallied , but only after @entity20 striker @entity19 had seen a one - on - one chance saved by goalkeeper @entity22 , again picked ahead of @entity23			1
@entity38 then stroked in a second on 77 minutes which killed off any hope of a comeback by last season 's @entity44 winners			0
@entity0 had opted to switch to afternoon training sessions this week in a bid to avert any lethargy from the traditional august sunshine , which failed to materialise			2
the @entity51 coach feels things are moving in the right direction and @entity1 can soon find another level when the fixtures start to come thick and fast once the @entity57 and @entity58 campaigns begin			1
on target again : new signing @entity34 scored his second goal in as many games outfoxed : @entity38 celebrates after scoring @entity1 's second goal in their 2 - 0 defeat of @entity12 ' i know that we need to work and improve , especially on the intensity of our game , which i want to be higher defensively , ' said @entity0			1
' but at the same time i know pre-season was not perfect and we need to go step by step			2
' for example , @entity71 played a fantastic 20 minutes , showing he is coming along , but if i play him from the beginning , his answer would not be the same , also with @entity75			0
' i know some players are at the top of their form , like ( @entity81 ) @entity80 , you can see clearly he is completely ready , and by the other way you can see some players are still up and down , have moments where they lose intensity and creativity			0
' but i think this is the beginning of the season , we go step by step			2
' step by step : players like @entity71 are yet to reach full fitness after a pre-season disrupted by the @entity93 @entity12 's fate is unlikely to be sealed by results at the title contenders , rather what they are able to do against the sides set to contest the battles in the other half of the table			1
the foxes will get some respite when they host @entity104 in their midweek cup tie , before preparing for the visit of @entity107 next sunday			0
manager @entity108 - whose side drew 2 - 2 with @entity110 on the opening day and host @entity112 soon after the international break - accepts @entity12 have little time to get used to their new surroundings			1
' it was always going to be the key factor , whether we could ( learn ) , ' said @entity108			2
' we do n't set standards low , it is whether you are able to adapt quick enough			0
' our performances have suggested we are a very capable side with some very good individual players , but our main strength is , as it was last season , our collective spirit and belief			0
' the game at @entity1 shows what a difficult league this is to operate in , but i have every confidence in my players , i have no doubts about that			1
' hit the ground running : defender @entity80 set up the opening goal for @entity34 @entity108 admits @entity12 could do with a couple of extra bodies to improve his options			1
midfielder @entity141 was forced off at @entity1 after suffering severe cramp while @entity143 and @entity144 are still not yet match fit			0
a potential deal to bring in @entity147 midfielder @entity146 , a free agent after leaving @entity148 , has stalled , but the @entity20 will continue to work right up to the closure of the window on september 1			0
' it has been a very problematical window for us , but we have tried to get deals done and we will endeavour to add to the squad , ' @entity108 added			0
