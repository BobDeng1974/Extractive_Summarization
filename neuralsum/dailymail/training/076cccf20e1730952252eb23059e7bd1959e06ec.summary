by @entity0 published : 15:59 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 15 march 2013 a cash - strapped council has angered residents by spending £ 1,000 of public money on a spoof @entity7 music video about potholes			1
the video was intended to promote @entity11 's highways department and its work			0
however , with road damage in @entity15 at record levels , locals were left wondering why the council was taking time out to make a parody of @entity7 's classic ' @entity18 '			1
the lyrics to ' @entity36 in @entity37 ' include the seemingly inappropriate line : ' at work , our days our full '			0
@entity21 gives @entity41 a run for his money , singing lines like ' complaints , we get a few / but those we do , we 're glad you mention			1
' he goes on : ' we 'll fill the holes , without exemption / we 'll lay , each tarmac course / not when it 's wet , but on a dry day ' hard work : the comedy cover took almost £ 1,000 and 36 hours to edit hoping for a hit : @entity21 , @entity56 , said that he hoped it would be as popular as @entity58 's ' in @entity59 ' some £ 113million was spent last year filling in the pot - holes but the spending is barely keeping pace with the maintenance backlog across @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity26 had hoped to emulate the popularity of @entity65 ' @entity58 which a viral hit with an @entity69 - inspired ode to its gritters called ' in @entity59 '			0
@entity21 explained : ' @entity58 's video , which has had over 470,000 views on @entity73 , is a brilliant way to raise awareness of the tough job councils do to support residents and businesses through maintaining the roads throughout @entity80			1
' @entity21 said he was ' inspired ' by ' in @entity59 ' and he hoped that his video ' broadcasts a serious and important message about the value of reporting potholes in an enjoyable way '			1
however the council , which is looking to slash £ 100m from its budget , was criticised by residents and campaigners for wasting public money			1
' drivel ' : @entity15 residents complained on @entity73 when the video went up , wondering why the @entity11 were not just fixing the potholes rather than singing about them @entity95 , campaign manager of the @entity96 , said : ' @entity11 should worry more about fixing the roads than singing about them			1
' an amusing video will be zero comfort to motorists dodging potholes on the highways			2
' ' this idea should never have got off the drawing board and instead transport chiefs should have spent their time and taxpayers ' money doing something useful			1
' the video drew abuse when it was uploaded to @entity73 yesterday			0
@entity113 wrote : ' looks to me like far too much time and effort creating this total waste of time instead of actually doing what you promise to do			0
' this is a really poor show			0
far more important things for the council to spend the funding on than uploading drivel like this to @entity73			2
' ' bad timing ' : @entity129 from near @entity130 said of the pothole crisis , ' it 's almost as though the only answer they 've got is to make an embarrassing video ' @entity135 added : ' so you think it 's a good idea to blow council tax payers money on making a video ? how much have we paid for this while @entity130 services are cut			2
' ' what purpose does this serve apart from a back slapping exercise for people who should be working for us not exercising egos			1
' pathetic truly pathetic you should be ashamed of yourselves			0
' @entity149 - tightening : @entity150 was seen to be splurging money on a publicity video when taxpayers are demanding better value for money from all their services @entity129 , 54 , of @entity157 , near @entity130 , suffered £ 165 damage to his car on the county 's roads last week			2
mr @entity129 , who had a compensation claim rejected , said : ' i think it 's stupid and sums up their mentality			0
' ' it 's terribly bad timing , it 's almost as though the only answer they 've got is to make an embarrassing video with all those blokes in the background , it 's disgusting			0
' it was reported last week workers from the council are repairing a 200 potholes a day , and have filled in almost 5,000 since the start of the year			2
the grand finale : highway workers make a group formation to sing the rousing last verse			0

@entity185 boss @entity21 took starring role as @entity7
residents want to know why council money was spent on ' exercising egos '
figures *reveal* that potholes will take 11 years in the @entity194 to fill
