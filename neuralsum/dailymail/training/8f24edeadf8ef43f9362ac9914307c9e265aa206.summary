picture posed by model they decided to rush the baby to @entity22 and despite efforts to revive him , he was pronounced dead just over an hour later , with one of the causes of death determined to be @entity28 streptococcal infection			1
the inquest seeks to clarify the circumstances in which he died , given little is known about what information was provided to his parents about home birthing risks , why the mother was not transferred to hospital sooner and what may have led to the baby becoming infected with the bacteria			1
in the case of @entity40 , the inquest seeks to clarify , among other things , why an obstetrician at @entity43 ( @entity44 ) who had determined the mother should not have a home birth due to previous foetal complications was not told of her plan to go ahead with it			1
