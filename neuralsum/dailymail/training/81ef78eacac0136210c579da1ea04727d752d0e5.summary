she 's mothered orphaned elephants , helped create @entity3 's mighty @entity2 and has spent years railing against poaching : life , for dame @entity6 , has certainly been interesting			1
now the veteran conservationist , who turns 80 tomorrow , has opened up for the first time on the moments that have made her life among the elephants so magical , although not all concern pachyderms			1
' a much treasured bond was with a @entity16 gazelle who we named @entity19 , ' reveals @entity20 , who still lives near the @entity3 capital @entity22 , in an exclusive interview with @entity24			1
' @entity19 , who spent her early months being hand - raised in @entity29 's daughter @entity42 's home , eventually became a loving pet			1
but tragedy almost struck when the little gazelle was grabbed by a lioness while sitting on a daybed on @entity42 's veranda			0
' @entity42 who immediately took off down the hill after the lioness , who had @entity19 in her mouth , ' remembers @entity20			1
' she was screaming like a banshee , which proved too much for the pride so they abandoned their kill but not before @entity19 was quite literally shredded			0
' it never occurred to me that @entity19 would ever be able to recover from this encounter but she was rushed to the vet and was stitched up , with my 15 - year - old grandson @entity63 , the person she loved the most , with her			0
' over the following weeks and months though , with tender loving care from everyone , @entity19 came back to life , and eventually made a full recovery			0
it was her unwavering love and loyalty to the family that was so humbling			0
' but little @entity19 is n't the only animal @entity29 and @entity42 have taken into their homes and hearts over the years			0
from gazelles to elephants and even rhinos , all have been welcomed into @entity20 's life , with many later finding permanent homes in the 9,000sqkm @entity2 , which was founded in the 1960s with the help of @entity29 and her husband @entity84			1
friends like these : @entity20 walks fearlessly up to a group of african elephants ( warning : do n't try this at home ) and one solitary zebra children together : one of @entity29 's orphaned elephant calves decides to play with her human children , daughters @entity94 and @entity42 cuddle : orphaned baby elephant @entity27 cuddles up to @entity29 while a fellow orphan , this one an ostrich chick , stretches out in the sunshine firm friends : @entity29 and baby @entity27 relax on a sand dune in @entity2 , the @entity3 wildlife reserve that @entity29 and her husband @entity84 helped found the existence of the park remains one of @entity29 's proudest achievements			1
' i had rewarding life with @entity84 , my late husband , ' she remembers			1
' building @entity2 together from virgin bush over so many years was extremely special			2
' but seeing my children and grandchildren 's love for the natural world and their commitment to the @entity123 and the work we do is the most rewarding - knowing that the legacy of all we have worked towards will continue long after i am gone			2
' sadly for @entity29 and her family , their work is becoming more intense than ever before , largely as a result of increased poaching driven by the demand for rhino horn and ivory from @entity137 and the @entity138			2
' bite your finger nails - it â€™s the same stuff , ' fumes @entity20			2
' the ridiculous hype around rhino horn is fuelled by false propaganda by those who want to make money from the sale of rhino horn , as well as false statements as to its healing powers or effects			0
' elephants too are dying , with six , including four calves , killed last month on @entity29 's doorstep , in @entity2			1
the worsening situation has put the @entity156 's orphan project under increasing strain , with even @entity29 admitting to wondering where it will all end			0
firm friends : @entity29 with elephant orphan @entity161 in 1968 ( left ) and right , completely dwarfed by the enormous animal 20 years later in 1989 not your average family : an orphaned rhino calf and a baby buffalo play with @entity29 's children in the family garden as she looks on close : @entity29 with another @entity16 's gazelle , this one named @entity171 , in her garden in the 1970s ' if i could choose a species to raise , it probably would n't be elephants , ' she confesses			1
' getting so attached to these extraordinary animals and then having to deal with all the trauma and heartbreak over the years has been very difficult to bear			0
' seeing poaching in action , as we do , and seeing the suffering elephants experience is extremely painful			2
' more often than not , you feel as if your best efforts just are n't enough			0
it 's frankly illogical to me that we should choose to kill a species so intelligent and so beautiful just to create trinkets			2
' but despite her heartbreak , @entity20 says she could n't imagine living any other way and adds that she hopes people will pull together to help defeat the poaching menace			1
' i truly love all animals , ' she adds			0
' people often assume elephants are my favourite but there are lots other species that i adore			0
apart from the big cats , i have raised just about every sort of animal imaginable over the years and every one has been remarkable			0
' not quite as remarkable , you might think , as @entity29 herself			0
to get involved with @entity29 's work and to help support the orphaned elephants in her care , see @entity211 honoured : @entity29 collecting an mbe at @entity213 in 1989 for services to conservation ( left ) and today aged 80 with her latest family of elephant orphans all friends : @entity29 cuddles @entity16 's @entity220 outside her home , while another orphan , a waterbuck , relaxes in a shady spot crisis : the current poaching crisis is swiftly approaching the level of carnage last seen in the 1970s			1
here , @entity229 picks through ivory taken from @entity2			1
