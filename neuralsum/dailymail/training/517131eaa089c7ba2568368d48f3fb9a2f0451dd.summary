by @entity0 , @entity1 tournament officials insist they have no regrets about their handling of the final day of the @entity5 , which finished in near - darkness and unusual circumstances at @entity8			1
' i thought it was the greatest day of golf that we 've seen in years and i could not be more pleased about the excitement , ' @entity9 , the @entity11 's chief championships officer said			1
a torrential downpour which flooded the course and caused play to be suspended for almost two hours meant the final pairing of @entity22 and @entity23 did not tee off until 4:19pm on sunday			1
the fact that rain had been forecast on an already saturated golf course raised questions as to why tee times were not brought forward or play started from two tees , as was the case in the third round of the @entity50 at @entity51 last month			1
' the forecast for sunday was the same as the forecast for saturday , which was a reasonable chance of showers and they could be sporadic and either hit us or miss us , ' @entity9 said			2
' unfortunately the one that hit us was literally only three miles wide but moved very slowly			0
we got three quarters of an inch of rain and the course was obviously saturated			2
but no , there was no real consideration given to moving the tee times forward			2
' there have been occasions where we have split tees in the @entity5			0
@entity73 , i believe , in 2009 we split tees after a rain delay			2
so it 's not something that we are opposed to doing			0
' if there was a huge front coming through that was absolutely guaranteeing rain , we would consider the best option for the running of a major championship			0
' in the dark : @entity22 celebrates his victory with the @entity5 after finishing his round late under cover : @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 ( second from right ) hold umbrellas to keep themselves dry @entity92 was one of the players to complain about being forced to take relief from casual water by dropping the ball in the semi-rough , but @entity9 added : ' it 's unfortunate and it 's tough on everyone			1
nobody likes playing in the casual water and with mud on the balls			0
but it 's part of the game			0
' we focused all the water movement to get it away from the landing areas so that ideally the players still had that option to play it as it lay , as well as finding the nearest point of relief that was dry			0
' in the end , the conditions arguably contributed to a thrilling conclusion which saw a five - way tie for the lead on the front nine and @entity22 eventually come from three shots down to win his second major title in the space of four weeks			1
' i think it 's wonderful golf for the people that watched it , how enthused they would be , thinking ' hey , i want to play that game ' , ' @entity9 added			1
' what better advertisement for the game than seeing the four greatest players probably in the world right now ( @entity22 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity133 ) playing to a crowd that was loving it			1
i could not be happier and more excited about how they performed			0
' not happy : @entity92 complained about taking relief from standing water by dropping in the rough			0

winner @entity22 holed his final putt in poor light
the final day had been suspended for two hours because of heavy rain
the decision not to employ a two - tee start has been questioned
@entity11 's chief championships officer @entity9 insists it was ' the greatest day of golf seen in years '
