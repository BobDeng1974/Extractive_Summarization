late night trickster @entity0 was up to usual shenanigans on thursday night 's show turning his attention this time on a bunch of sucker fashionistas so desperate to appear on trend that they were willing to talk admiringly about labels they could n’t possibly have heard off – because they simply do n’t exist			1
@entity11 took place this week at the @entity13 near @entity14 and @entity15 sent along a young presenter to try and catch out some of the fashion forward attendees			2
like lambs to the slaughter the hipsters spoke admiringly of their love for the work of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			2
it 's called fashion look it up ! these fashion forward hipsters were interviewed on @entity15 about made - up trends including wearing watermelons as headgear an aspiring fashionista talks of her admiration for the supposed hot new designer - the @entity36 character @entity23 surely they were n’t talking about the deeply unfashionable @entity36 character , the @entity40 actor famed for portraying @entity41 in @entity42 and the fictional spokesman for the @entity46 car and truck brand ? the best of the bunch was the young man wearing everything black and too much foundation who spoke of his admiration for @entity54			1
‘ good aesthetic , ’ said the goth of the werewolf boy from @entity57 , seemingly oblivious to just how much of a key influence the @entity60 character had been on his current image			0
having humiliated one set of posers , @entity0 ’s next trick was to ask his unwitting stooges if they had seen the runway show where model had worn watermelons on their heads			0
video source @entity71 @entity54 , left , was the werewolf boy from @entity57 , the fashion fan above seemed oblivious to just how much of an influence the tv character had been on his look the man in yellow claimed he was at the runway show in which male models had appeared with watermelons on their heads ‘ it 's called fashion look it up ! ’ said one super serious fashionista with fierce green hair as he glared at the interviewer for daring question the creative integrity of the designer			1
another dedicated follower of fashion was asked for their reaction to the models who wore dog poop on their heads as they strode down the runway			1
she was slightly disgusted by the idea , but preferred to speak of her admiration for the model for pulling it off			0
even the ‘ uniboot ’ from @entity107 footwear designer @entity106 won admiring comments even though wearers would be expected to hop along in the invented fashion item			0
@entity0 had begun the ‘ @entity109 ’ section by commenting how @entity11 was really just an opportunity for designers to play a practical joke on the women of @entity114 with the outlandishness of some of the ensembles that they sent down the runways			2
hop along : two attendees give their impressions of how they might attempt to move in a @entity106 ‘ uniboot ’			0

a *collection* of fashion forward hipsters *profess* their love for the designs of @entity23 and @entity54
@entity0 's ' @entity109 ' feature also includes *witless* fashionistas also willing to along with a uniboot and models with dog poop on their heads
