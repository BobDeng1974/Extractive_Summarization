@entity0 will be entering the ring for the first time in 2015 , after he was forced to pull out of a january fight against @entity12 due to a stress fracture in his back			1

@entity0 poses at his weigh - in ahead of the fight with @entity4 at the @entity22 ' at 11 fights he 's probably looking at me like i 'm a raw novice in the professional world , ' @entity0 told @entity26			1
' he 's got 50 fights and he 's looking at himself like he has so much experience but hunger and determination has got me through a lot of the time			1
' i 'm 10 fights in now - double figures			2
i can definitely say i 'm learning and everything will be second nature on saturday			2
' i 'll try not to let the nerves get to me			0
i 'm going to stay calm			0
it 's a mental thing			2
' @entity40 has been really good			0
i 've been sparring with guys who are sharp and i 've been handling business in sparring so i should be good to go on saturday night			0
' @entity4 's last fight in the @entity44 came in november 2013 , when he lost the @entity46 final to @entity47 - an opponent @entity0 took just 90 seconds to knock out in november			1

' there 's no sparring you can do to prepare for @entity53 , ' @entity0 said			1
' with 50 fights and so much experience , he 's a very awkward opponent			1
' i 've watched his videos and he 's awkward to hit			0
' he 's entertaining as well - he can get in your head mentally			0
' i 've been out five months so i 'll probably have a bit of ring rust myself while he 'll be sharp so there will be some heavyweight blows and may the best man win			0

' boxing is about opportunities and i 'm looking forward to this fight , ' @entity4 said			2
