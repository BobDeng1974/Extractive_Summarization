by @entity0 published : 07:58 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 10:39 est , 22 may 2012 the mother of a baby boy who was turned away twice by hospital receptionists today said he nearly died because of a lack of doctors			1
@entity6 was rushed to @entity7 by his mother @entity8 , 22 , when he became lethargic and unable to keep liquids down			1
but she was amazed when the receptionist in the accident and emergency department claimed her son was not ill enough to be seen by a doctor and sent them home			2
relief : @entity6 was finally seen after @entity8 and her partner @entity17 insisted he was seen at their local hospital the mother - of - two brought @entity6 , now nearly two , back to the department a few days later when his conditioned worsened - but again a different receptionist tried to convince her to go			1
she stood her ground and eventually her son was seen by doctors - who found he was suffering from severe dehydration and was just hours from death			2
he was rushed to a specialist baby unit and clung to life for three days before eventually showing signs of improvement			2
@entity8 then recorded a matron blaming the blunders on the fact the hospital was ' understaffed ' and morale was low			1
she said : ' the bottom line is this is a result of the @entity38 cuts			2
' staff have to work longer hours and do everything - because there is nobody else to cover them if they do n’t			2
' there are not enough doctors working so the receptionists are trying to keep the waiting list down by only checking in emergency cases			2
' she added : ' it makes my blood boil that the government will throw tax payers ’ money at things like the @entity57 but they ca n’t get elementary things right on the @entity38 and have ended up in a situation where a receptionist is attempting to diagnose patients			2
' @entity6 , pictured after he was finally diagnosed with severe dehydration at @entity65 's busy @entity64 department @entity8 , who lives with @entity6 and partner @entity66 , 26 , and @entity67 , seven months , in @entity68 , @entity69 , took her sick son to casualty in april 2011			1
she noticed that @entity6 was lethargic and not keeping any liquids down - but the receptionist at @entity68 ’s busy a and e department quickly sent her home			2
the mother was sent home with a booklet and told if she was really concerned she should take him to an out - of - hours @entity81 instead			1
@entity8 said : ' i was pregnant at the time with @entity67 and extremely emotional			1
' a male receptionist said he was not ill enough to be seen in a and @entity85 so i presumed if the receptionist was sending me home he must have some medical experience			2
' when people say something authoritative and they work in a hospital , you presume they know what they are talking about			1
' the truth is that same receptionist was checking in drunks and patients with minor injuries and they were attended to by doctors - whilst my little boy who was actually in the last stages of dehydration and dying was sent home			2
' i remember thinking that was n’t right but i did n’t know what to do			0
' @entity6 was taken to @entity106 , @entity69 , an hour away , and put on a drip in their specialist baby unit @entity8 then took @entity6 to the out - of - hours gp surgery that same night after his condition worsened			1
but the doctor did not pick up on how sick the poorly her son was either and told her to take him home			1
however , less than 12 hours later @entity6 ’s eyes had sunk in , he was barely moving , being violently sick and had chronic diarrhoea			0
terrified @entity8 called @entity116 - who advised her to take him to @entity64 and e at @entity119			1
but again a different receptionist tried to send her home			0
@entity8 said : ' i could n’t believe it when another receptionist tried to fob me off			1
' here i was with a clearly sick baby in my arms and another receptionist tried to tell me again that i was overreacting and that i should just take him home			0
' she was huffing and puffing and trying to make me feel stupid			0
but this time @entity17 was at my side , and together we stood our ground and demanded to see a doctor			0
' she reluctantly booked @entity6 in and shortly afterwards a doctor examined him			0
' the doctor immediately flagged @entity6 up as a medical emergency because of his limpness , high temperature and his inability to hold down liquids			0
he was diagnosed as being in the last stages of dehydration and medics warned his body was starting to shut down			0
angry : @entity8 said she could have lost her son if she had n't pushed to see a doctor they took him to @entity106 , @entity69 , an hour away , and put on a drip in their specialist baby unit			1
@entity8 said : ' i could n’t stop crying - i thought he was going to die			1
@entity17 tried to console me but i was a mess			0
' we did n’t know if he was going to pull through			0
he was fighting for his @entity151 was an agonising three days before he began to show signs of improvement and that whole time i was n’t sure if i ’d lose him			0
' i just kept thinking that the whole situation could have been avoided if @entity158 and @entity85 had not sent him home in the first place			0
' and by now i felt furious that the person who had sent us home was just a receptionist			0
' his furious parents demanded an apology from the hospital and finally secured a meeting with the @entity168 , who run the facility , months later			1
during the meeting @entity8 recorded a matron at @entity119 blaming the @entity173 break for the blunders , stating they were “ understaffed ”			1
@entity176 , matron at the hospital , told @entity8 : ' we have been understaffed			1
' that ’s not your fault			0
we have had to work some pretty awful shift patterns so morale has been really low and that makes people a bit bad @entity185 that is absolutely no excuse for what has happened to you			1
' in the recording of the meeting , the out - of - hours service doctor , dr @entity190 , also apologised			0
he said : ' i should have taken longer to examine him them had him immediately admitted to hospital			1
i ’ve learnt from this incident and i will make sure it wo n’t happen again			0
' @entity168 and @entity198 apologised to @entity8			1
a spokesman said : ' patients are routinely asked if they would normally seek gp advice for the condition they are presenting with and if so are directed to the out of hours @entity81 next to @entity64 and e for the initial consultation			0
' work has recently been completed to integrate the @entity81 into the @entity209 department which means patients are seen by the right clinician more quickly			0
' in the last year we have made significant changes to the @entity158 and @entity85 department including a review of paediatric pathways , an increase in paediatric training for staff and we have also introduced a new @entity220			0

@entity8 was told by a matron that the blunder happened because the hospital was ' understaffed ' and morale was low
