@entity0 has slammed the artificial pitch at @entity3 ’s @entity2 as ‘ by far the worst pitch ’ he has ever played on after his late free - kick gave @entity6 a narrow 2 - 1 win over the minnows in their opening @entity10 qualifier			1
it was the first time the @entity12 had been used for a match and the difficulties with controlling the ball were clear for all to see			0
the roll would be uneven and bounces awkward , with clusters of black rubber pellets spraying into the air with each landing			0
dodgy surface : @entity0 said the @entity12 in @entity3 was the worst he 's ever played on , despite scoring twice in the win matchwinner : despite the surface cutting up all game @entity0 was not to be denied , scoring a late free - kick winner to send the @entity28 fans into raptures at last : the @entity31 star wheels away after scoring a crucial winning goal for @entity6 , getting their qualifying campaign off to a good start jumping for joy : @entity0 celebrates his winning goal 10 minutes from time in front of the travelling @entity28 fans roar : @entity0 is joined by @entity40 to celebrate the late goal that spared their blushes against an @entity3 team that has won just one international in their history equaliser : @entity0 had also scored with a commanding header in the first half to bring @entity6 back on to level terms click here to read @entity53 's match report from @entity3 manager @entity54 had tried to play down fears of the pitch ’s unsuitability before kick - off but afterwards declared he felt it was not up to @entity61 standards			1
the surface was only certified by @entity64 's governing body last week after originally failing tests because of a fast roll			1
‘ it was by far the worst pitch i have ever played on , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i ca n't describe how bad , bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with			1
‘ we said at the start that the most important thing was to get three points			0
other teams are going to find it difficult coming here so for us to get three points is important			0
‘ we want to qualify and you have to come to places like this and get victories			0
’ a 3g - or ' third generation - pitch is made of artificial plastic grass ' blades ' and is suitable for all weather conditions , meaning it is largely unaffected by differing seasons and temperatures			2
the artificial turf is held in place by a thin base layer of sand , as well as an infill of rubber pieces which act like the soil on a normal pitch in order to allow grip			2
plastic pitches were originally banned from @entity100 football in 1995 after @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 had trialled them during the 1980s , with @entity105 the first @entity100 stadium to try it in 1981 and @entity107 the last @entity109 club to remove theirs in 1994			0
however , the @entity111 made a u-turn in march when they announced that synthetic pitches could be used in every single round of the @entity115 this season - having previously only allowed them up until the first round proper			0
@entity117 , who play in the @entity119 , have had great success with their 3g pitch and have championed its cause			2
artificial pitches are also used in many places on the continent , particularly in @entity126 and @entity64			0
targeted : @entity0 also had to deal with some roughhouse tactics from @entity3 's defenders , tackled here by @entity130 from behind tricky task : @entity6 ' players such as @entity133 , pictured , had to get used to playing on an artificial pitch in @entity3 challenging : @entity136 's @entity135 was also tested by the tricky surface against the minnows , who have lost their last 45 competitive matches @entity54 kept his team from practising on @entity142 through fear of its effects on joints and went through a light training session on monday evening for the first time			1
‘ i can talk about the pitch now , if you 're a passing team forget it , ’ he said			1
‘ i do n't want to make a protest as i want other teams to come here			0
‘ but when we trained on it , my heart sunk			0
in my opinion the pitch is not up to standard of @entity61 qualifier			2
’ mission complete : two - goal hero @entity0 salutes the @entity6 fans after the final whistle , but he 'll know they have a long way to go to qualify kicking up : the artificial 3g turf sprays up from the pitch as @entity135 passes in midfield during the crucial victory surrounded : @entity6 enjoyed 71 per cent of the possession against @entity3 , including this attack by @entity135 , but struggled to make a breakthrough eyes on the ball : @entity0 manages to get a pass away on the tricky surface despite the attentions of @entity3 's @entity178 calm down : @entity0 appeals for @entity6 fans to settle down after scoring their second goal , with supporters having run on the surface on the pitch : @entity6 fans knocked down advertising hoardings and encroached on to the pitch after @entity0 's free - kick winner celebrations : @entity28 fans joined the players to celebrate the winning moment , with goalscorer @entity0 acting to calm things down if @entity6 were expecting an easy ride in the principality they were stunned when @entity3 took the lead after just six minutes			1
@entity197 defender @entity133 conceded a soft penalty , referee adjudging him to have pulled the shirt of @entity200			0
@entity178 made no mistake from the spot to score @entity3 's first competitive goal in four years			1
but @entity0 rescued @entity6 with a classy double to get the qualifying campaign off to a winning start			1
first he headed home from @entity209 ' excellent cross			0
and the world 's most expensive player curled in a beautiful free - kick with 10 minutes remaining to claim the victory			1
spectacular : the sun sets over the @entity217 del @entity216 in @entity218 , where the match took place committed : @entity6 midfielder @entity40 challenges for the ball with @entity3 's @entity222 and @entity223 relieved : @entity0 is all smiles at the final whistle as him and his @entity28 team - mates head to the travelling support nightmare : @entity178 celebrates giving @entity3 a dream start in the @entity10 qualifier , but it did n't last until half - time tense : @entity54 cut a nervy figure on the touchline as @entity6 toiled , but the boss was eventually saved by @entity0			1

@entity0 and @entity28 manager @entity54 slammed the @entity238 's artificial pitch after @entity6 beat @entity3 2 - 1
@entity0 said : i ca n't describe how bad , bobbly and hard the pitch was to deal with
@entity54 added : i can talk about the pitch now , if you 're a passing team forget it
