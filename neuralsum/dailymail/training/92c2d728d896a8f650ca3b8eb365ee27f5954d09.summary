by @entity0 one former champion lost his life and the other lost his game			2
they say great courses produce great champions but @entity8 is a great course with a @entity11 legacy both tragic and mysterious			1
@entity12 and @entity13 were in the prime of their professional lives when they won in 1999 and 2005 respectively			1
@entity12 was the once - brash bon vivant who had matured gracefully			1
in winning by one stroke , he had words only for the vanquished , @entity22			1
tragic : @entity12 died a few months after winning the 1999 @entity11 a month later he put an arm around @entity25 's shoulder and took him for a walk along the fairways in @entity28 in @entity29 and sang songs with the locals			1
that september he was the only @entity32 to emerge with any credit from the @entity35 nonsense at @entity36 , conceding a 20ft putt to @entity38 because he was so sickened by the abuse the @entity40 was receiving			2
three weeks on , he was on a private plane that never reached its destination			2
the saddest thing i have ever covered was the tournament that followed in @entity46			2
@entity12 had barely entered his 40s and had won over all his peers			1
this was fate at its most savagely cruel			0
they stopped @entity53 and brought a television into the debating chamber when @entity13 battled @entity25 down the stretch			1
it was monday morning in his native @entity58 and there was no stopping the celebratory mood when @entity62 did what few others ever managed and jousted successfully with @entity25 in his prime			0
later that year , he won the @entity67 at @entity68			0
when he went home to @entity71 , they organised a @entity73 parade			0
sealed with a kiss : @entity13 celebrates winning the 2005 @entity11 the years since have not been so kind			1
@entity13 did n't know what to do after achieving his lifetime 's ambition of winning a major			1
some days he struggled to get out of bed			1
for years he struggled to turn in a good score			1
he has n't won a single tournament since that golden year			0
in january , i had a beer with him in @entity84			0
he had just got the news that a foot injury was far worse than he thought and it would be several months before we saw him again			1
we still have n't seen him			0
last month , he combined the news he would be missing from @entity8 with the sad addendum he had split up from his wife , @entity91			0
it is not just the winners , either			0
look at the runners - up from 1999 and 2005			1
@entity22 is playing under the cloud of being the subject of an @entity98 investigation into potential insider trading ; woods , like @entity13 , is sitting at home			1
at @entity8 this week we will revel in the inevitable twists and turns a major brings and end up saluting the winner of @entity32 's national championship			1
but let 's hope the victory brings lasting joy , rather than a sense of sadness and loss in the years to come			2
quote of the week ' i do n't know 100 per cent but i 'm pretty sure i grounded my club in the bunker			0
for five days i practised but i could n't get it off my mind			0
it 's heartbreaking but it 's the right decision			2
' honest : @entity119 disqualified himself for possible rules breach five days after qualifying for the @entity11 , @entity32 @entity119 ( pictured above ) disqualified himself for this possible rules breach nobody else had seen			1
say what you like about golfers but when it comes to integrity on the field of play , they stand alone			0
it 's a major scandal that @entity132 star @entity131 is missing out looking down the entry list at every major championship usually affords a moment 's reflection to lament the absence of one or two players			2
there is one omission from the @entity142 at @entity8 next week , however , that is so wrong on every level it provokes a sense of outrage			1
teen sensation : @entity148 from @entity149 is the best young female golfer in @entity151 @entity148 from @entity149 is , by common consent , the best young female golfer in @entity151			1
the 18 - year - old is also no 1 on the @entity151 women 's order of merit			2
and yet she is not playing			0
just to put the tin lid on matters , the bigwigs at the @entity158 are presently congratulating themselves on what they perceive as their unique exercise in democracy			0
a men 's and women 's open are being played back to back on the same course for the first time and already we are being treated to homilies proclaiming equal treatment of the sexes			2
never mind that the women are being paid far less than the men in prize money			0
if the entry criteria for both events was the same , @entity175 would have qualified several times over			0
she is 33rd in the world , was the star of the last @entity182 and finished seventh in the season 's first major , for heaven 's sake			2
and how disrespectful for the @entity186 1 not to be exempt			0
imagine if they tried that with the men ! the @entity158 are forever telling us about their efforts at growing the game among juniors and here was a golden chance to offer a special exemption to a young role model fully deserving of one			0
instead , they blew it			0

@entity12 died a few months after winning the 1999 @entity11
@entity13 has struggled to cope with achieving lifetime ambition
@entity148 's omission from the @entity142 is outrageous
