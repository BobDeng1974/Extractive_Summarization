proving to be masters of disguise , these nocturnal birds hide in walls , trees and stones in a bid to hunt for their breakfast			0
but a wildlife photographer was able to pick them out with his camera lens as they perched silently waiting for their prey in @entity15 , @entity16			1
in the selection of obscured images captured by a photographer , known only as @entity20 , sees the wise creatures use different environments such as a stone wall and a barn doorway to make themselves invisible			1
can you spot the hidden owl in this picture ? the owl , circled above , perches on a wall as it blends into the bark of the tree			2
the images were captured by wildlife photographer @entity20 in @entity16 the 49 - year - old said : ‘ the owls will camouflage themselves against the stone wall while they sit in wait for their next meal			1
‘ generally it will be worms and sometimes small mice , but every now and again they will get a bird too			0
‘ it ’s one of those questions that will never be answered - how do they make themselves the same colour as the stone wall ? ’ the wildlife photographer , whose work has featured on @entity54 , believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot			1

' where is the owl above ? circled , the nocturnal creature sits peacefully on wall while @entity20 is able to capture these obscure images of the early - morning hunters in @entity15 ‘ it ’s one of those things where you will sit and sit and some people still ca n’t see it , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ the only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette			0
‘ you have to see them either move or standing close to a light			0
’ the wildlife photographer , whose work has featured on @entity54 , believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot and says its even harder in the flesh ‘ the only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette			2
you have to see them either move or standing close to a light , ' he says the birds have become accustomed to @entity20 , who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the shots			1
he said : ‘ they ’re getting more used to me now , so they do n’t fly away quite as often			0
‘ they ’ve really done well this year			0
they ’ve paired up and bred really well			0
they ’re now growing in numbers			0
’ the bird 's nest location varies based on its habitat , but their homes have been found in holes in trees , rocks , cliffs , river banks , walls and buildings the birds , which are most active at dusk , have become accustomed to @entity20 , who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the photographs @entity20 has several accolades and appeared in a book portraying the @entity117 2013 and has also won the @entity119 competition his images portray many aspects of the @entity122 , including the early - morning owls in @entity15 , @entity16 , in this mystical picture series three owls sit in a disused barn window in the early hours before hunting for their prey			1
there is a fourth owl camouflaged in this picture , but can you see it ? the fourth owl can be seen perched on the roof of the barn			2
the birds are farsighted , meaning they are unable to see things close to them very clearly some owls can turn their heads as far as 270 degrees and these birds are much quieter in flight than most birds of prey , while hunting for food like other small birds another owl sits on top of a stone wall , in the left of the picture			2
the walls are a prominent feature in the @entity122 and are home to a vast array of wildlife as the sun comes up , an owl peers at the camera lens while it waits patiently for its breakfast			2
the birds generally eat worms but sometimes they have small mice owls can not move their eyes within their sockets to a great extent , which means they must turn their entire head to see in a different direction			0

a wildlife photographer was able to use his camera lens to pick out these camouflaged night - time birds
they are pictured silently waiting for their prey in @entity15 , @entity16 in the early hours of the morning
the wise creatures use a tree , a stone wall and a barn doorway to obscure themselves and appear invisible
