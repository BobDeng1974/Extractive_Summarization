by @entity0 for @entity1 she has a wardrobe to rival @entity3 's , wore a dazzling @entity5 gown to tie the knot and is a member of the royal family			2
no , we 're not talking about the @entity10 , but another glossy member of the family who 's been hiding in her shadow - until now			0
meet @entity14 , the wife of food critic an @entity17 's son @entity16			1
' it 's lovely to have all of that attention , but having everybody dissecting what you look like , what you 're wearing - it 's quite a strange thing , ' she told @entity37 's @entity36			0
however , away from the camera 's glare , the 40 - something stylista is making waves in the fashion industry			0
she worked as @entity43 to @entity44 , the editor of @entity45 , but claims she was the ' worst pa in the world '			0
wedding style : @entity14 married @entity20 back in 2005 in a dress designed by @entity23 in @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , the same designer that created the @entity10 's part of the royal set : @entity14 , who holds a prestigious job at a glossy fashion magazine , says that @entity17 is a very hands - on grandmother who loves to cook for the family ' @entity57 , who was deputy editor of @entity45 at the time , totally saved me and took me into the features fold , ' she told @entity37			1
she now works as an associate editor of @entity62 , and senior editor of @entity65 magazine , as well as mothering her two children , @entity67 , 6 , and son , @entity69 , 4			1
so does the @entity10 seek style advice from her ? ' we 've talked about designers we admire in the past and she 's always very complimentary about what i wear but , clearly , she feels she 's got more important things to think about - and that 's what makes her so endearing , ' revealed @entity14			2
fashion 's darling : @entity14 currently works as an associate editor at @entity62 and loves the tailored look - but she buys her shoes from sample sales ! she seems quite at home in the royal family , who she describes as a ' completely relaxed ' set			1
@entity14 revealed that @entity17 is quite the hands - on grandmother who apparently loves to cook roast dinners and scrambled eggs for the whole family			1
a regular on the front row , she loves to wear @entity96 jeans - @entity10 's favourite - as well as @entity100 shirts and tuxedo - style style blazers from the @entity103 ' brand @entity97			0
as for accessories , only @entity105 totes will do and while she loves @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity110 shoes , proving she 's a down - to - earth fashion fan , she always snaps up the bargains at sample sales			1
we wonder if she ever grabs a pair or two for @entity10			0
