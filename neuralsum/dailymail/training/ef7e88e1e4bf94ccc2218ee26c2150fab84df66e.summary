the western @entity0 will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century if no action is taken to curb climate change , researchers have warned			1
they say that ' unprecedented drought conditions ' - the worst in more than 1,000 years - are likely to come to the @entity6 and @entity7 after 2050 and persist because of global warming			2
it is the first study to predict that the coming intense dry spells could exceed the decades - long mega-droughts that occurred centuries ago and are blamed for the demise of certain civilisations in the late 13th century			2
researchers say the current mega-drought in the @entity0 is going to get worse			2
they say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050			1
and there 's an 80 % chance one could last at least 35 years			1
pictured is a warning buoy sitting on the dry , cracked bed of @entity23 near @entity24 , @entity25 ' nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century compared to what we think of as normal conditions now , ' said study lead author dr @entity30 , a @entity31 atmospheric scientist			1
' we 're going to have to think about a much drier future in western @entity33			1
' according to the study , published in the journal @entity36 , there is a more than 80 per cent chance that much of central and the western @entity0 will have a mega-drought lasting at least 35 years later this century			1
' water in the @entity6 is going to become more precious than it already is , ' said study co-author dr @entity41 of @entity42 since the year 2000 , seven western states in the @entity0 has seen their driest periods in centuries			1
these states are @entity47 , @entity25 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 and scientists in @entity25 have warned that the region may be experiencing a century - long ' mega-drought '			0
the warnings came after sediment studies showed @entity25 is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580 , and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years			2
in 2013 , @entity25 received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850			0
however droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state			2
looking back over several thousand years , droughts have been known to last over a decade , and in some cases they can last a century			2
and the patterns tend to repeat , meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future			0
' i was honestly surprised at just how dry the future is likely to be			0
' ' i look at these future mega-droughts like a slow moving natural disaster			2
we have to put mega-droughts into the same category as other natural disasters that can be dealt with through risk management			0
' the study is based on the current increasing rate of rising emissions of carbon dioxide and complex simulations run by 17 different computer models , which generally agreed on the outcome , according to the researchers			0
the regions looked at include @entity25 , @entity49 , @entity51 , @entity48 , @entity50 , @entity47 , northern @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , most of @entity96 , southern @entity97 , western @entity98 , western @entity99 , and northwestern @entity100			0
looking back in records trapped in tree ring and other data , there were mega-droughts in the @entity6 and @entity7 in the 1100s and 1200s that lasted several decades , but these future ones will be worse , dr @entity30 said			1
those were natural and not caused by climate change , unlike those forecast for the future			1
' natural droughts like the 1930s @entity114 and the current drought in the @entity6 have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less , ' said dr @entity30			1
' what these results are saying is we 're going to get a drought similar to those events , but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years			1
' because of changes in the climate , the @entity6 will see less rain			0
but for both regions the biggest problem will be the heat , which will increase evaporation and dry out the soil			0
the result is a vicious cycle : the air grows even drier , and hotter , dr @entity30 said			1
@entity31 scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century ( shown ) ' we 're going to have to think about a much drier future in western @entity33 , ' said study lead author dr @entity30 from @entity31			1
pictured , a woman looks at a pier once surrounded by the waters of @entity144 on 12 march 2014 in @entity145 , @entity91 scientists had already figured that climate change would increase the odds of worse droughts in the future , but this study makes it look worse and adds to a chorus of strong research , said dr @entity153 , co-director of the @entity154 at the @entity155			1
' these results are not surprising , but are eye - opening nonetheless , ' said dr @entity153 , who was n't part of the research			0
the risks and dangers are worse today because of the larger population and greater dependence on water resources , scientists warned			0
' we are the first to do this kind of quantitative comparison between the projections and the distant past , and the story is a bit bleak , ' said dr @entity173 , a co-author and climate scientist at the @entity175 , part of the @entity177 at @entity178			2
' even when selecting for the worst mega-drought - dominated period , the 21st century projections make the [ previous ] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the @entity183			0

the brown line represents the variation in dryness since the year 1000 ; the lower the line on the graph , the drier the conditions			0
coloured lines to the right side of the graph represent what climate models see ahead currently the western @entity0 has been experiencing a drought for about 11 of the past 14 years ( stock image shown )			1
the risks and dangers are worse today because of the larger population and greater dependence on water resources , scientists warned researchers also projected a continued rise in emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming , and looked at a scenario in which actions were taken to cut back on greenhouse gases resulting in lower emissions			0
both approaches raised concern for the future			0
' the results ... are extremely unfavourable for the continuation of agricultural and water resource management as they are currently practiced in the @entity222 and southwestern @entity0 , ' said dr @entity223 , professor in the @entity224 at the @entity225 , who was not involved in the study			2
currently the western @entity0 has been experiencing a drought for about 11 of the past 14 years			1
the dry area spans @entity25 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity47 , @entity91 and @entity92 and other parts of the region , directly affecting more than 64 million people .			0

researchers say mega-droughts in the @entity0 are going to get worse
they say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050
and there 's an 80 % chance one could last at least 35 years
these droughts are caused by climate change - while ones in the past were *due* to natural processes
