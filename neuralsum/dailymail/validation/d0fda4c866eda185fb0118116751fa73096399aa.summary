@entity0 believes @entity1 could find themselves at the back end of the grid when the new @entity5 season gets under way			1
the @entity8 - based marque have struggled to put in the pre-season testing miles due to a number of issues with their new car - with @entity13 returning to the sport and providing their first attempt at a current @entity5 power unit			1
with other teams pounding around @entity18 and @entity19 collecting valuable data and information ahead of the season opener in @entity23 on march 15 , @entity1 have often found their car back in the garage with one fault or another			1
the @entity1 car could struggle at the start of the season , reckons @entity0 @entity0 fears for @entity1 add to that the fact two - time world champion @entity30 will not be racing in @entity32 after crashing out at high - speed in @entity19 and it has not been the best reunion for @entity1 and @entity13 - with @entity0 tipping them to really struggle in the opening rounds			1
' there is definitely a chance of that , ' @entity0 said when asked if the eight - time constructors ' champions could find themselves behind a host of other teams this year			1
' so many cars have improved			2
the middle of the pack seems very close			0
@entity48 seem better , @entity49 look better			0
@entity50 look faster than they were last year as well - @entity51 and @entity52 , also			0
' the middle pack is tight but we have n't seen the @entity1 setting their best times so we do n't know where they will be			2
' the run of over 100 laps ( from @entity58 in @entity19 ) put them in the middle of that pack - is that a true showing of their pace ? we really do n't know			0
' we do n't know the whole grid order because i do n't think everyone has shown their full hand and , unfortunately for @entity1 and everyone else , i do n't think @entity70 have either			2
' with the news that @entity30 , re-signed to the team after the @entity73 left @entity50 , will be sitting out of the curtain - raiser after his mysterious crash has only added to @entity1 's issues - with @entity0 questioning why the rekindled relationship with @entity13 has got off to such an underwhelming start			1
' @entity1 have been a disappointment so far , ' the former @entity80 and @entity81 driver told the @entity83			2
@entity30 will miss the curtain - raiser in @entity32 after his horrific crash in @entity19 ' you were thinking " @entity13 have come back and are back with @entity1 again			1
they had all the success in the late 80s and they had last year to look and see what was going on - they saw other manufacturers having to overcome issues whilst they were working on their engine			0
' all of these issues they have had have made it really difficult for them to get any serious running whatsoever			0
they have had a mass of problems that have n't helped them			0
' it is sad news that @entity30 will not be in @entity32 - everything has gone against them so far			1
' the preparation is something that maybe was n't to the high standards than @entity108 is always after			0
' this is something that should have been ready , the new @entity13 relationship and moving it forward with @entity112 and @entity30			2
' if it all comes together they might get a good result but it is going to be hard in the opening couple of races - the hardest of their careers			0
