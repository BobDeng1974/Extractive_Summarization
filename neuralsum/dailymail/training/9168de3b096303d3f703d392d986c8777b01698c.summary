flower power : princess @entity1 joined her grandmother 's garden party at @entity9 today top to toe : the princess kept up the floral theme with a rose - topped fascinator by @entity20 milliner @entity19 the outfit was a safe bet for the 25 - year - old who is n't always praised for her fashion choices			1
most famously , she was mocked around the world for the unusual @entity32 - designed fascinator she wore to her cousin prince @entity34 's wedding to @entity35			0
when it came to her footwear today , she seems to have taken her cue from another @entity39 - who recently advised against wearing heels to an event on grass			0
the sister of the @entity35 offered her pearls of wisdom in the june edition of @entity47 , referring to the best way to dress for a day at @entity49			0
sensible choice : @entity1 took @entity52 's advice wearing wedges to the event on grass doing granny proud : @entity1 chatted to many of the guests at the garden party she wrote : ' it is a busy day trying to fit in horse racing , betting , picnics , and afternoon tea - oh , and avoiding sinking your heels into the grass			1
i recommend wedged shoes - there 's often a lot of walking			0
' her sister , @entity35 , is another firm fan of wedges and is frequently pictured in a pair			0
the sensible foorwear was definitely needed for princess @entity1 as she spent time on her feet mingling with some of the hundreds of guests invited to the palace event			1
ready to party : the @entity3 and the @entity79 were dressed up for the occasion welcome : the @entity3 greets some of her many guests show must go on : the @entity79 was happy to shake hands despite recently having a minor procedure on this right hand that required bandaging inspiration : earlier this week , @entity1 visited the @entity2 the @entity3 was also in attendance wearing a matching lavender coat and dress designed by @entity90			1
she was joined by the @entity79 who was in good form despite recently needing medical attention			2
