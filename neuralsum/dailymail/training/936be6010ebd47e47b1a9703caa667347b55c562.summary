this is a mystery every bit as fiendish as any of those solved by the great detective himself , and it is baffling the ten million armchair sleuths who watch tv ’s @entity8			1
how did the world ’s most famous private investigator fake his own death at the end of the last series ? now it seems that the case might have been solved by a rival master of deduction with a knack for explaining the seemingly impossible — fellow fictional sleuth @entity22			1
in the final episode of last year ’s series of @entity8 , the world ’s most famous detective had been lured to the roof of @entity28 in @entity29 by his arch - nemesis , the deranged @entity30			1
sherlock there he was told that several of his close friends would be assassinated if he failed to commit suicide			2
after issuing this warning , @entity30 shot himself in the mouth and appeared to die			2
@entity37 then had a brief mobile phone conversation with @entity39 , before stepping off the building			2
viewers saw @entity37 fall several storeys , before lying in a bloodied heap on the pavement , with bloodtrickling from his head			0
as @entity39 rushed to the scene , he was knocked over by a bicycle			0
by the time he arrived , the bloodied @entity37 , who seemed to have no pulse , was being whisked away by paramedics			0
yet just a few scenes later , as @entity39 visits the grave of his best friend , viewers see that @entity37 is in fact alive and well			0
so how did he do it ? the question sparked months of frenzied speculation , across @entity58 , @entity59 , and the endless websites devoted to both the @entity62 show and author @entity63 ’s original novels and short stories			1
the show ’s creators have been tight - lipped as to how the death was faked , saying only that all will be revealed in the show ’s third series , which airs later this year			1
but this week , as @entity72 , who plays the show ’s protagonist , was seen filming the opening episode of the next series in @entity77 , an intriguing new theory emerged			1
actor @entity78 , star of tv drama @entity22 , in which a magician detective solves outlandish mysteries , claimed to have discovered that the makers of @entity8 had borrowed a plot twist from a ‘ similar ’ episode of his own show , aired more than a decade ago , ‘ when someone jumped off the roof of a party ’			1
does his explanation stack up ? or are others more credible ? or did he he use ... the @entity94 a 1998 episode of @entity22 , @entity96 , a man faked his own death by leaping from a second - floor balcony onto a grass - covered trapdoor , with a secret crash net hidden beneath			1
he was helped by an accomplice , who removed the trapdoor before he jumped , and then quickly replaced it			0
onlookers , who saw the man jump and then glimpsed his body lying prone on the ground , had no idea that he was actually unharmed			0
@entity78 reckons the creators of @entity8 used a similar dramatic device , noting that — during the detective ’s notorious rooftop fall — viewers never actually saw the impact			1
‘ nobody saw him land , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a gap of seven or eight seconds , which is when they did the clever bit			0
’ closer examination of the scene gives at least some clues as to what this alleged “ clever bit ” may have been			0
a camera shot , taken from above , shortly after the fall , appears to show a large white rectangle on the surface of the pavement			2
if @entity78 is correct , this would have been some sort of removable panel , covering a safety net , which was manned by an assistant			0
‘ he [ @entity37 ] needed at least two accomplices : one up top , one below , ’ the actor said			0
‘ leaping off a second - floor balcony ’s no big deal if there ’s something to catch you at the bottom , if you ’ve dug yourself a big hole with a tightly sprung net inside [ and ] rigged up a camouflage frame — which slides across			2
but would @entity37 have been able to build a similar trapdoor in the pavement of a busy @entity29 street ? and would @entity8 ’s creators lower themselves to stealing a decade - old plot twist ? not everyone is convinced and the rival theories all have their supporters .			1
