i yield to no one in my love of the old days — warm beer , cricket on the village green , bobbies on bicycles two by two , all that — but it 's rare a chance arises to compare the rose - tinted past with the brave new world , as it did on saturday evening when @entity15 's high - octane @entity14 coverage went head - to - head with @entity18 v @entity17 in the @entity19 semi-final on the @entity21			1
as we know , the @entity14 has the money and prestige , but what the @entity19 has is history , and boy does the @entity21 love a bit of history ? lest you were in any doubt , its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late sir @entity34 doing the @entity35 from the film of @entity37 ( ' we happy few , we band of brothers , ' and so on )			1
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 fronted the @entity21 's coverage at @entity45 @entity21 presenter @entity40 prepares to present the @entity47 50th anniversary special broadcast reading defender @entity48 ( left ) chases @entity18 midfielder @entity49 ( right ) on saturday @entity51 forward @entity50 celebrates after scoring his side 's winning goal in the @entity19 semi-final stand - in @entity47 presenter @entity56 ( left ) with pundits @entity57 and @entity59 ( right ) the excuse , i guess , was that @entity17 's nickname is the @entity17 , but as the second - tier team are also known as the @entity17			1
the @entity21 even gave us a moment of history at half - time with a breakdown , something that used to be a regular feature of tv outside broadcasts , when a feature on @entity75 's shock semi-final victory over @entity76 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through			0
in such instances , the @entity21 is lucky to retain the services of @entity40 , the best presenter of live football on tv			2
@entity15 have never really replaced the disgraced @entity82 , who had the benefit of longevity in the post			0
the @entity21 needs to fight hard to avoid @entity86 falling into the hands of rivals			0
not that @entity15 's presenters are less than competent — @entity90 did the job — but it 's never a good sign when you have to go to @entity93 to check which one it is			1
the price of live @entity14 football is now way beyond the reach of the @entity21 , which may be the clincher in @entity86 's future			1
while the @entity21 's match had the lion 's share of the goalmouth action , it was difficult to resist turning over to @entity15 on occasion			1
having invested its billions in the @entity14 , @entity15 does n't skimp on the peripheries			2
the sound always seems a little crisper , and in punditry , where @entity15 offers us the @entity110 of analysts , @entity112 , the @entity21 counters with the mid-range @entity113			0
in the commentary box , @entity15 fields @entity116 for its big games in the knowledge he 'll rarely make a bad call , while the @entity21 never seems sure who its best commentator is			0
the man on the job on saturday , @entity124 , is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story			0
the outcome on @entity15 was depressingly predictable			0
the @entity21 may miss out on the @entity14 's pricey weekly thrills , but took the biscuit on saturday			2
the @entity21 's @entity130 talks pitchside with @entity132 's @entity131 at @entity45 @entity133 pundits @entity134 ( left ) and @entity135 ( right ) discuss their match analysis			2

the weekend saw @entity21 's @entity19 coverage compete with @entity15 's @entity14
it was a *refreshing* *throwback* to see the @entity21 's use of *archive* footage
@entity40 remains one of the @entity21 's prized *assets* and they must keep him
