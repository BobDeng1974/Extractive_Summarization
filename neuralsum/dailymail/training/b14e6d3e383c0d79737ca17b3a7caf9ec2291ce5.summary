by @entity0 and @entity1 for @entity2 the former child model who accused several @entity6 figures of sexually abusing him , including x-men director @entity7 , can dismiss his lawsuit , but he has the option to re-file it later , a federal judge ruled wednesday			1
@entity10 said in a previous court filing that he wanted to dismiss the lawsuit , not because it lacks merit , but because he ca n't find a new lawyer to represent him			1
@entity10 's last lawyer , @entity15 , left him when he backed out of a $ 100k settlement from @entity7 at the eleventh hour last month			1
@entity27 district judge @entity26 said @entity7 did n't prove that @entity10 's voluntary dismissal would damage the director 's reputation , and that the money spent defending himself does n't constitute legal prejudice			1
' any alleged damage to defendant 's reputation may well be ameliorated by plaintiff 's voluntary dismissal of the action , ' she said			0
@entity39 had reported last month that @entity7 's settlement payment would be far less than he would spend in legal fees defending against the claims and would be viewed as a nuisance payment			2
in his initial suit , @entity10 claimed he began being sexually abused when he was 14 or 15 and moved to @entity45 with his family to start his acting career			1
it was in @entity45 that he was introduced to @entity6 powerplayer @entity49 and his lover @entity50 when he was invited to a party at @entity49 's home			0
these parties allegedly ' featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys , ' according to @entity10 , but he maintains he ' never freely ' consented to the advances			0

he claims @entity7 later said he was ' sexy ' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him			0
the director then told @entity10 to do the same to him , but he says he resisted			0
@entity7 has denied these allegations			2
@entity10 previously dropped three similar lawsuits against other entertainment figures , including former network tv executive @entity64 , who is currently seeking punitive damages after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself against @entity10 's claims			1
the lawsuits were filed under an unusual state law in @entity81 that created a window for civil cases in sex - abuse cases when the statute of limitations has passed			0
@entity7 's attorneys could n't immediately be reached for comment			0
an attorney who @entity10 has said is advising him , but is not legally representing him , did n't immediately return a phone call seeking comment .			0

@entity10 will be able to dismiss his lawsuit against director @entity7 , but can refile it later
