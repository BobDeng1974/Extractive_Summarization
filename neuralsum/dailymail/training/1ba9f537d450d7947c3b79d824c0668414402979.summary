@entity4 , @entity5 and other types of food poisoning may have lifelong consequences			1
studies have shown that people caught up in food poisoning outbreaks are more likely to develop a host of lengthy illnesses , including diabetes , arthritis , kidney failure , high blood pressure and even heart attacks and strokes			1
some , such as kidney damage thought to be caused by powerful poisons released by the bugs and arthritis triggered by a faulty immune response , occur within weeks			1
others , such as high blood pressure , take years to appear			1
long - term : @entity4 , @entity5 and other types of food poisoning may have lifelong consequences experts say the chance that the link is coincidental is remote - and are calling for more to be done to identify victims of food poisoning and monitor their long - term health			1
others say that prevention is key - and better hand and food hygiene would cut the number of cases of food poisoning and so the number of people left with lifelong complications			1
almost 90,000 cases of food poisoning are recorded each year in @entity44 and @entity45			1
however , the true number is likely to be closer to one million , as only a minority of victims will visit their doctor and give a sample that will be logged in the official statistics			2
common bugs are e coli , usually caught from eating undercooked beef including mince and burgers ; campylobacter , found in raw and undercooked meat , especially chicken ; and salmonella , which is found in eggs , meat and milk			0
studies have linked @entity5 ( pictured ) to kidney failure and diabetes while they can be fatal , most people recover after a few days			1
but this month ’s issue of @entity68 warns that even a short bout of sickness or diarrhoea could have long - term consequences			0
studies have linked e coli to kidney failure and diabetes and campylobacter to bowel problems and @entity78 , a potentially fatal condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves , causing muscle weakness and paralysis			1
@entity4 has been blamed for a form of arthritis			2
@entity68 says : ‘ it is a scary idea that food poisoning - which we think of as lasting just a few days - could instead have lifelong after - effects			1
‘ the incidence of such “ sequelae ” , in medical parlance , has been thought to be low , but not many researchers studied the problem until recently			0
‘ new findings by several scientific teams suggest the phenomenon is more common than anyone thought			0
’ figures are still relatively scarce			0
but one of the most ‘ stunning and persuasive ’ studies was carried out on @entity103 after thousands of men and women became ill from drinking water contaminated with manure			0
a government - funded study found that , eight years later , those who suffered severe diarrhoea due to the dirty water were more than twice as likely to have had a heart attack or stroke than those who were unaffected or only mildly ill. their risk of kidney problems was more than three times as high			2
they also had greater than normal odds of high blood pressure			1
even those with milder symptoms had circulatory problems that may have been triggered by the stomach bug			0
@entity128 researcher dr @entity127 recommends that survivors of severe food poisoning , such as that caused by the @entity133 strain , undergo regular blood pressure and kidney checks			1
common bugs are e coli , usually caught from eating undercooked beef including mince and burgers @entity141 , of the @entity142 in the @entity143 , said : ‘ we want to establish the true burden of disease because that is what policy makers use to decide what is a public health priority			0
‘ as long as we focus only on the acute form of foodborne illness and not the long - term health consequences , we ’ll under - estimate how significant a problem this is			0
’ professor @entity155 , of the @entity156 , said it is important that people are aware of the complications , some of which develop within weeks of the sickness and diarrhoea			2
he said : ‘ if it does come up , they can go and see their physician about it			0
’ @entity168 , emeritus professor of microbiology at @entity170 , stressed that prevention is key			0
he said : ‘ once you get infected with one of these bugs , it is in the luck of the gods whether you get the complications or not			0
‘ there is nothing you can do to stop the complications but you can stop the infections happening in the first place			0
‘ the vast majority of people who get food poisoning will not suffer any long - term consequences but the minority will			1
‘ that ’s why it is absolutely vital we get the number as low as we can			0
’ professor @entity168 advocates hand washing , thorough cooking of food and taking care not to contaminate other foods with uncooked meat and poultry .			2

victims could develop diabetes , arthritis , kidney failure and high blood pressure
