the euro has hit a twelve - year low against the dollar but @entity4 shoppers are n't going to see any benefit from the dip			1
according to economists there is simply too much demand in the @entity4 for high - end @entity11 goods that companies will not be busting out discounts			1
instead a reverse shift has been occurring			1
for example , @entity16 's classic handbag , which was priced at $ 2,250 in 2007 , cost $ 4,900 last year , according to @entity18 and @entity19 , a luxury consulting firm			1
and @entity22 's iconic monogram canvas handbag , which sold for $ 620 in 2007 , climbed to $ 970 last year			1
taste for luxury : according to economists there is simply too much demand in the @entity4 for high - end @entity11 goods that companies will not be busting out discounts the problem for @entity4 : they do n't buy enough @entity11 goods , except for high - end products			1
clothing might come from @entity34 or @entity35 , furniture from @entity37 and cars - even foreign brands like @entity40 - are mostly made at home			0
@entity11 brands tend to cater to higher income families who want to buy a bit of prestige			2
brands like @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are luxury products with strong demand			2
so there 's no incentive to cut prices , says @entity57 , senior industry analyst for @entity58			0
@entity49 sales rose 15 percent last year , while @entity50 sales were up 6.5 percent and @entity51 rose nearly 10 percent			0
each company is likely to pocket the extra money from converting dollars to euros , no matter whether the cars are made overseas or in the @entity4 , @entity57 says			2
@entity65 , however , might use the weak @entity66 to reduce prices and boost struggling sales , @entity57 says			0
@entity65 's @entity4 sales fell 3 percent last year even though overall @entity4 auto sales across all brands grew 6 per cent			1
it 's the same issue with , fine wines , @entity75 handbags and those designer stiletto shoes			2
@entity77 , president of the @entity78 , which represents 20 to 25 beer , wine and spirits importers , says the price of fancy wines that are on the shelves now were already set three or four years ago when contracts were signed by @entity4 importers			2
but he says if the disparity continues between the @entity4 dollar and the euro , ' you might see a softening of prices			2
' at most , shoppers will see a two or three per cent price dip , says @entity93 , who leads retail leasing and marketing at @entity96 and specializes in the luxury market			0
' anecdotally , @entity4 prices have n't gone down on @entity11 - made apparel and alcohol , though such declines would take some time to filter through the system , ' @entity93 says			1
' we probably wo n't see the effects for several months			0
' that 's because the production cycle for @entity11 brands takes about a year , so those so - called status products were already produced			1
bitter taste : @entity77 , president of the @entity78 , says the price of wines that are on the shelves now were already set four years ago when contracts were signed by @entity4 importers no incentive to cut prices : @entity49 sales rose 15 percent last year , while @entity50 sales were up 6.5 percent and @entity51 rose nearly 10 percent moreover , @entity119 , vice president of international trade for the @entity121 , noted a shift in manufacturing away from @entity11 and more toward @entity123 - like @entity37 and @entity124 - as factories in that region have improved the quality of making complicated goods			1
' we have n't seen any discernible decline , ' he says			0
the one bright spot for @entity4 : vacations to @entity11 are now much cheaper			1
thanks to the currency shift , travelers will pay less for hotel rooms , museum admissions and meals out			0
' it 's basically a 20 per cent - off sale on the whole eurozone for @entity4 , ' says @entity142 , ceo and co-founder of airfare search site @entity144			1
' we 're already seeing a significant increase in search activity for flights from the @entity4 to @entity11 , which is a leading indicator of travel			1
' there are 19 countries that use the euro			0
so those considering deals should look at @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity47 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
' this is the best time to travel to @entity11 in years , ' says @entity174 , executive editor of @entity175			2
' @entity4 can now indulge in a fancy pastry and chocolat chaud without the budget - busting guilt			1
' the catch : it will still cost a lot of money to get to @entity11 during peak summer months			2
demand for travel is so strong that most airlines do n't have to cut prices to sell seats			0
back in april , the @entity11 currency was trading at 1.38 dollars to the euro			0
that means that one dollar bought you about 72 euro cents			0
now the exchange rate is hovering around 1.14 dollars to the euro , so one dollar buys you 87 euro cents			0
not since august 2003 has the euro traded this low against the dollar .			0

according to economists there is simply too much demand in the @entity4 for high - end @entity11 goods that companies will not issue discounts
instead a reverse shift has been occurring
