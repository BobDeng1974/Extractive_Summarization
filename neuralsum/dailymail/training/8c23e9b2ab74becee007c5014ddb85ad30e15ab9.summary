@entity0 laid down the gauntlet with two goals in @entity4 's win on opening night			0
now it 's time for @entity6 to step forward and become the undisputed no 1 star of the @entity8 , taking his place alongside @entity10 and @entity11 as an all - time great			1
it will be hard to escape the name of @entity11 when @entity6 , 26 , steps out into the @entity14 to face @entity15 on sunday			1
step up : @entity6 will bid to emulate the @entity8 triumph of @entity11 @entity10 @entity18 4 ( 1958 , 1962 , 1966 , 1970 ) @entity8 wins 3 ( 1958 , 1962 , 1970 ) @entity17 played @entity19 won @entity20 @entity18 4 ( 1982 , 1986 , 1990 , 1994 ) @entity8 wins 1 ( 1986 ) @entity8 runner - up 1 ( 1990 ) @entity17 played @entity22 @entity18 2 ( 2006 , 2010 ) @entity8 wins @entity23 played @entity24 won @entity25 1 @entity11 won the @entity8 virtually single - handed for @entity26 in 1986 and became the country 's biggest idol since @entity29			1
@entity6 , who left his home town of @entity31 for @entity32 at 13 , does not receive the same adulation from fans who loved the passion and rags - to - riches story of @entity11 , even though he has scored 38 goals in 86 caps since his debut in 2005			1
named captain by coach @entity41 to try to inspire him to hit his best form , @entity6 sometimes speaks as if he is almost weighed down by talk of emulating ' @entity44 '			1
@entity6 says : ' it is hard not to feel honoured when important people compare you with @entity11 - he 's the best there 's ever been			1
my message , though , is please do n't compare me with him yet			0
he won a @entity8 for our nation , and until i 've managed to do the same the comparisons are not something i welcome or accept			2
' i know i have a responsibility , especially as captain , to the people of @entity26 but i try not to let that pressure get to me			2
i approach every game - it does n't matter if it is a @entity60 final or a @entity8 game - as i did as a child â€¦ and that is to have fun			2
on the ball : @entity6 dribbles the ball during a training session at @entity14 ' i know the importance of the @entity8 but if you approach games with a smile on your face and with the intention just to have fun on the field , then you often find things look after themselves			1
' it will please @entity6 enormously , given the pressure on his shoulders , that back in @entity80 , 1978 @entity8 - winner @entity81 , who later became a team - mate and good friend of @entity11 , thinks he has already proved himself as an all - time legend , regardless of what happens in @entity4			1
@entity81 never thought @entity11 could be equalled , saying at the time : ' there is no point in anyone trying to be as good as him			0
' but he now thinks @entity6 deserves to be classified with @entity10 and @entity11 among the greatest of all time			1
relaxed : @entity6 clowns around with @entity93 during a training session at @entity14 ' he has n't won a @entity8 but look what he has achieved by the age of 26 ; @entity32 's all - time top scorer , three @entity98 , four times the @entity99 , ' says @entity81 , now 61			1
' he is already there in my opinion			0
if he wins the @entity8 , he could be at a level all on his own ! ' for me , it 's a bit of myth that the people in @entity26 do n't love @entity6			1
i think if anyone from @entity109 goes there , they will be amazed at the affection for him			0
' @entity81 won the @entity8 on home soil , then secured a move to ' @entity113 ' with pal @entity114 in one of the most stunning transfer deals of all time			2
despite having to temporarily play his football elsewhere during the @entity119 in 1982 , he stayed in @entity80 after retirement and still lives with his family in @entity122			0
he hopes @entity26 can win on enemy soil in @entity4 - and believes they can			2
' @entity26 will have more supporters than any country except @entity4 , ' he says			0
' and when people question the @entity26 defence , i do n't think it 's as bad as people say			0
they only conceded 15 goals in 16 qualification games ( second best behind @entity133 ) which is good for a very tough @entity135 group			0
glory : @entity11 lifts the @entity8 trophy after @entity26 won the 1986 @entity8 ' @entity26 qualified for this @entity8 easily compared to the last one when they brought in @entity11 as manager and only made it in the final game			1
they are all good signs and in my view , while @entity143 is a great player , @entity6 is better - the best in the world right now			2
' @entity26 have the oldest squad in @entity4 with an average age of nearly 29 and they brought @entity150 defender @entity149 , 33 , in from the cold after he helped his club win the @entity153			0
but to win the @entity8 they need @entity6 at his best			1
he sometimes seems too modest , introverted and without enough of an ego to do what @entity11 did			0
in the past 12 months , he lost his title of @entity99 to @entity143 , and @entity32 lost @entity159			0
former @entity80 manager @entity160 said in these pages last week this would be @entity6 's last chance to dominate a @entity8			1
his style of leadership is to stay grounded and stress how difficult it will be for @entity26			0
' there are about six or seven teams that will have a real belief they can win the @entity8 , ' adds @entity6			2
' @entity171 have set the standard in international football over the last six years			0
@entity4 always step up , and playing in front of their fans will give them extra incentive			0
' yet the fact @entity6 could shake the monkey of @entity11 off his back offers all the incentive he needs .			2

@entity6 will seek to emulate @entity10 and @entity11
