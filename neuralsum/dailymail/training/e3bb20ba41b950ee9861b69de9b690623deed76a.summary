by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:12 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 16:38 est , 8 july 2013 @entity2 was today asked to investigate fresh claims of law - breaking over union influence in the @entity6			1
the scandal deepened today as the @entity8 called on the @entity9 to investigate allegations of orchestrated behaviour by @entity12 in @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity15 has insisted the problems which have plunged his leadership into crisis were confined to @entity19 , but there is a growing sense that union domination of the party is more widespread			1
pressure : @entity15 is facing the biggest test of his leadership since beating his brother @entity27 for the top @entity6 job in september 2010 the @entity6 leader is preparing to give a major speech tomorrow on overhauling the party ’s links with its union paymasters , but is expected to stop short of severing ties completely			1
he has been warned he must win an ‘ ideological battle ’ with his union paymasters to avoid political oblivion			2
@entity12 was accused of trying to fix the selection process for @entity19 ’s parliamentary candidate to benefit @entity40 , a close friend of unite general secretary @entity41			2
police have launched a fraud inquiry over claims that people were signed up as @entity6 members by @entity12 – without their knowledge – so they could vote for @entity48			2
but @entity6 bosses have also received complaints about @entity12 ’s activities in several other constituencies			2
today @entity53 , a @entity54 vice-chairman , called on @entity2 to investigate claims of ‘ fraudulent behaviour ’ in two @entity58 constituencies			0
but the @entity6 dismissed the move as a ' silly political stunt '			1
police : @entity54 vice-chairman @entity53 has written to @entity9 commissioner sir @entity62 , asking @entity2 to investigate union behaviour in two @entity58 seats in a letter to @entity9 commissioner @entity62 , mr @entity53 said : ‘ i am sure that you will be aware of the current police investigation taking place in @entity69 , into the alleged fraud committed by the @entity12 in @entity19			1
' it is alleged that @entity12 in @entity19 were signing up their own members to the @entity6 without their consent and knowledge			1
‘ i am concerned that this instance is just the tip of the iceberg , as @entity12 themselves admit they are targeting another 40 @entity6 parliamentary selections for similar treatment			0
senior @entity6 sources have also confessed that the problems go wider than just @entity19			1
‘ in particular there are two @entity58 constituencies of particular concern : @entity13 and @entity14			0
’ what is going on ? there is a battle for control of the @entity6 between leader @entity15 and the unions , most significantly @entity12 and its general secretary @entity41			1
what has happened ? the row was triggered by allegations that @entity12 paid for dozens of people to join the local party in @entity19 - possibly without their knowledge - in order to swing the vote and ensure its preferred candidate @entity40 won			2
it has now been suggested that union influence in constituencies goes beyond @entity19 , including two seats in @entity58 : @entity13 and @entity14			1
’ why does this matter ? the idea of @entity6 being in hoc to the unions remains toxic for many voters			0
@entity12 has given more than £ 8million to the @entity6 since mr @entity15 became leader and has boasted of its intention to secure a more left wing agenda			1
he only beat his brother for the @entity6 leadership in 2010 because he won the support of unions			0
he claims that in @entity13 , @entity12 offered their members free @entity6 membership in exchange for attending a meeting with general secretary @entity41			1
‘ given that this constituency appears on a @entity12 target list along with @entity19 , i believe that the circumstances of this membership recruitment merit investigation ’ , mr @entity53 added			0
the letter also points to claims from a @entity58 @entity6 activist @entity127 that @entity12 is ‘ bankrolling ’ a number of ‘ orchestrated ’ campaigns			2
she singles out @entity14 for ' special attention '			0
mr @entity53 says the activities , if true , could be in breach of the @entity134 under the terms of ‘ false misrepresentation ’ or fraud by abuse of position			0
he adds : ‘ i would be very grateful for any assistance that you can offer in investigating this deeply troubling matter			0
’ labour insiders had been keen to stress that problems with @entity12 's practices in @entity6 constituency parties was contained to @entity19 alone			1
a @entity6 source said : ' this is a silly political stunt			1
' we have no evidence of possible criminal behaviour anywhere outside @entity19			0
if @entity53 has , he should produce it			0
if he has not , he should stop wasting police time			0
' but the suggestion that it could be more widespread , and the involvement of @entity158 's biggest police force , means the scandal could spread far beyond mr @entity15 's control			2
tomorrow , the @entity6 leader will outline plans to change his party ’s rules and limit the power of the unions			0
insiders say mr @entity15 is examining whether to hold open primary elections – which would let the general public elect parliamentary candidates – as well as plans to speed up the selection process , leaving unions less time to mobilise			0
he also plans to make it more difficult for unions to sign up new party members			0
leaked @entity12 documents show it sought to exploit rules that let unions pay new members ’ fees to secure 41 candidacies			0
@entity6 has since scrapped the scheme			0
party insiders said concerns have already been raised about the union ’s activities in @entity188 and @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 and @entity13			0
scandal : the unite union led by @entity41 , left , tried to impose @entity40 , right , on the @entity19 seat @entity12 has also been accused of plotting to oust shadow foreign secretary @entity199			2
lord @entity200 , the former home secretary , said @entity12 leader @entity41 wanted to take @entity6 ‘ back to the 80s ’ – and that mr @entity15 must move swiftly to make sure the party survives			1
he said mr @entity15 faces ‘ an ideological battle ’ with ‘ those who want to take @entity6 back to the 70s and 80s , as @entity41 does – when we represented the sectional voice , the weak echo of every industrial demand of the trade unions ’			1
‘ i am in no doubt that the leader of @entity12 wants to impose an ideological direction on the @entity6 that would lead us into political oblivion , ’ he added .			1

@entity9 urged by @entity8 to investigate @entity12 influence in @entity13 and @entity14
suggests scandal is more widespread than problems *uncovered* in @entity19
party sources dismiss letter to @entity224 as ' silly political stunt '
@entity200 warns of ' ideological battle ' with unions at the heart of @entity6
@entity15 vows to ' mend not end ' party 's *relationship* with the unions
