a thief appears to have been caught red - handed stealing from a fashion boutique after the store 's owner took the bold step of posting footage of the alleged crime on @entity7			1
shop owner @entity8 was so outraged when she discovered four items were missing from her women 's clothing store in @entity12 that she filmed @entity14 footage of a woman appearing to stuff clothes into her bag and shared it online			1
' here is 3 minutes worth of yesterday thief ! she stole 4 items in total ! please like and share ! we want to find her ! [ sic ] , ' she wrote on @entity7 on saturday			2
a dark haired woman can be seen looking up at the shop 's security camera as she moves between a few clothing racks outside the store 's entrance			2
at one point she takes a long multi-coloured dress of a hanger , puts the hanger back on the rack and folds the dress up as she turns her back to the camera			0
some people questioned why she did n't stop the thief , as in the video @entity8 seems to be filming the incident on her phone			1
outrage : she appears to put a blue dress in her bag without paying for it ( left ) and the woman was seen sifting through the dresses on the racks ( right ) but she explained she had filmed the @entity14 footage on a screen on her mobile so that she could post it online			1
when asked why nobody stepped in she also said : ' unfortunately the staff member was working alone , and was preoccupied with loyal & paying customers in the store , who she was helping			0
' the woman was in and out within 3 - 4 minutes with the garments - not once stepping foot inside the store			0
the other camera angles show that she was keeping an eye on the staff member			0
' unfortunately you can not trust anyone these days , and the staff member was doing the right thing by assisting other customers who needed her help			0
