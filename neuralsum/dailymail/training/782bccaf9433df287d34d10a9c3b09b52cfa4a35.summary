the @entity51 side faced @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 in the competition			1

@entity66 double - zip washbag - £ 250 to carry every toiletry a @entity8 star could get his hands on , be it gel to keep the hairdo in place during the action or aftershave to smell terrific after the match			2
beats by @entity80 - £ @entity79 player worth his salt can be seen without their ludicrously oversized headphones in tow			2
these top - of - the - range headphones are the audio must - haves , if you 're willing to spend big			0

with just a few hours of training each day , @entity8 footballers have a lot of time to kill			0
@entity114 - £ 119these brand - spanking new shiny trainers are pride of place in @entity104 ' bag , and while they 'll cost you a pretty penny , it 's a fair bet the @entity31 star 's boot sponsors were generous enough to chuck him a complimentary pair			1
