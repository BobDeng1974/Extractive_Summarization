the head honchos of national burrito chain @entity1 have apologized following an incident in which a single @entity5 location employee raised his arms in a one man - protest against uniformed @entity9 customers			1
the ' hands up , do n't shoot ' gesture got nine officers in such a tizzy december 16 , they turned heel and left the store			0
contrary to an internet rumor gone viral , however , they were not refused service at the @entity5 eatery			1
' clearly , the actions of this crew member undermined that effort			0
' it was an almost unavoidable response from the company 's top brass after @entity46 groups became enraged both with news of the employee 's seemingly tasteless act and with the subsequent untrue reports that the @entity5 store refused to serve the men in blue			1
the amplifying effect of social media and blogs even led to suggestions the @entity1 company itself is somehow anti-police			2
hands up : the employee took it upon himself to raise his hands in the now ubiquitous anti-police brutality gesture , but in an apology released by company co-ceos , @entity1 said it did not reflect on the chain 's beliefs pointing toward a decidedly unofficial @entity71 page named thank you @entity9 that claimed ' an officer was in fact refused service at @entity1 , ' as evidence , @entity68 user @ @entity69 posted the @entity5 store 's phone number in apparent attempt to get his 20,000 followers to harass its employees			1
all of that , of course , because of one employee 's self - motivated act			0
' we have conducted a review of the incident including interviews with the crew and a review of video footage from security cameras , ' read @entity1 's ceo 's statement , obtained by the @entity95			1
they continued : ' our investigation has shown that this appears to have been a spontaneous , unplanned action taken by an individual crew member and was not a coordinated effort by the staff of the restaurant			0
' as the @entity95 points , this incident occurred at the very same store once known to be frequented by area cops because of a ' prohibited and unofficial ' 50 percent discount officers were being given			1
from a 2012 @entity109 article : ' the crowd at lunch and dinner is peppered with officers : some at tables , more in line and some carrying to - go bags			2
they are drawn by burritos and tacos , the proximity to @entity5 ’s courthouses and an unadvertised special : a 50 percent discount given to officers in uniform			1
' many of the police officers who eat there may not have been aware of the discount , the restaurant ’s general manager , @entity125 , said			0
some express surprise when their bill comes to half of the advertised price			0
“ when they see it , they go , ‘ thank you very much , ’ ” he said			0
' police officers are banned from receiving gratuities for their services			0
when asked by the @entity109 about the @entity1 's hefty discount , the store 's manager referred to it instead as a ' courtesy			2

the burrito chain 's chiefs say they *'re* sorry about the incident at the @entity5 location
the incident *inspired* a false internet rumor the @entity1 had refused to serve the officers
that same @entity1 location , always *popular* with @entity9 , was in 2012 reported to be giving them ' prohibited and unofficial ' 50 percent discounts
