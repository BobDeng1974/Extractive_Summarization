by @entity0 published : 03:19 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 10 april 2013 a judge has said he will take 30 days to decide whether the rights to @entity4 's life story can be sold by her trustee to pay off debt as part of her bankruptcy proceedings			1
miss @entity11 , who was acquitted almost two years ago of killing her daughter @entity4 , filed for bankruptcy in january and appeared in court last month , claiming that she has debts of almost $ 800,000			1
@entity16 - based bankruptcy trustee @entity15 wants to sell off the rights to miss @entity11 's story claiming that it is her best bet for paying back the estimated $ 792,000 she owes			1
delayed decision : a judge will take 30 days to decide whether @entity4 's bankruptcy trustee can sell her story to pay off some of her debts most of miss @entity11 's debts are owed to her defence lawyers , with the original bankruptcy petition claiming that she owns a little over $ 1,000 in assets			1
but miss @entity11 does not want to sell her story and her attorneys strongly disagree with mr @entity15 's proposed unprecedented legal move			1
judge @entity32 will announce his decision whether to allow the worldwide exclusive rights to her life story to be auctioned off to the highest bidder in 30 days , but admits that he is ' sceptical ' about the controversial proposal			1
one bidder , a @entity39 attorney named @entity40 , has reportedly put in an offer of $ 10,000 dollars on the condition that @entity11 's story never sees the light of day and that she makes no profit from it			2
mr @entity15 says that one other offer has been tabled so far for $ 12,000 from a @entity47 man who intends to use the story for ' entertainment value '			1
others are said to have expressed an interest			0
offers : miss @entity11 's bankruptcy trustee claims that two bids have already been tabled for her story with others expressing an interest lifestyle : since @entity11 's release from the @entity60 in july of 2011 , seen here , she says she 's been living with friends and with the help of gifts from strangers miss @entity11 's lawyers have described the proposal to sell off something that only exists in their client 's memory as ' orwellian '			1
according to @entity72 , their filing argues : ' by allowing property that can only be created by post-petition labor to be sold as part of the bankruptcy estate , a debtor would never be able to achieve a " fresh start "			0
' perhaps more troubling , the order sought by the trustee would result in the judicial invasion and taking of thoughts and memories that have not been memorialized but are contained solely within the debtor â€™s mind			0
' notorious : @entity11 became nationally notorious after she was accused of murdering @entity4 , whose body was found six months after she went missing in june 2008			2
the pair are pictured together here their case also argues that a ruling in favour of the sale could damage miss @entity11 's personal relationships as she would be unable to even discuss her memories with family members over email or any ' social media ' under the terms of mr @entity40 's offer			2
her listed debts include $ 500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her criminal defense lawyer during the trial , @entity107 ; $ 145,660 for the @entity108 for a judgment covering investigative fees and costs related to the case ; $ 68,540 for the @entity113 for back taxes , interest and penalties ; and $ 61,505 for the @entity117 for court costs			0

she was arrested and put on trial for @entity4 's murder , but in july 2011 was acquitted of the killing			0
a new hearing will be heard in 30 days			0
