prime minister @entity6 is soon to be given his very own @entity8 application that will bring together the latest information from across government at the touch of a button			1
at a glance , he will be able to see up - to - date crime statistics , unemployment numbers , @entity17 waiting - list data and all kinds of other facts and figures which otherwise might get missed in his hectic schedule			1
hectic routine : programmers are devising an app so prime minster @entity6 ( above ) can keep up to date with all the latest government information at any time of the day according to @entity29 , the idea for the app came after his advisers went on a trip to the @entity32 it is being created by programmers inside the @entity35 and will also include ' real time ' feeds from @entity37 , @entity38 and other news outlets			1

he takes his @entity8 on flights where he catches up episodes of @entity32 drama @entity60 and @entity62			0
in other ways , however , mr @entity6 is far more traditional when it comes to communication			2
differing styles : mr @entity6 prefers to communicate by writing notes on official papers , whereas his predecessor @entity69 ( right ) used secure e-mails unlike his predecessor @entity69 , who had a secure e-mail address linked with the government network , mr @entity6 prefers to receive papers on which he can write notes which can then be reviewed by staff			2
mr @entity6 does , however , stay in informal contact with mps and advisers via text message			2
the app is expected to be ready by march and could be made more widely available beyond just the prime minister			0
