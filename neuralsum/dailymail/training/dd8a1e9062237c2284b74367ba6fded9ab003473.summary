by @entity0 @entity1 is confident he will be ready to fire @entity2 to glory from the start of the new @entity6 season			1
the @entity8 international looked laboured in the @entity9 ’ 1 - 0 @entity11 defeat to @entity12 on sunday - a result which saw @entity14 win the pre-season tournament			1
having seen fellow forwards @entity17 and @entity18 light up the @entity20 on saturday , with the former grabbing four goals in a 5 - 1 victory over @entity23 , @entity1 ’s performance was nowhere near as eye - catching			1
and , although he admits he is struggling for fitness following an extended season , @entity1 believes he will be much sharper in time for sunday ’s @entity43 clash with @entity44			1
“ we did well on saturday and had a great game , scored a lot of goals but on sunday there was another team who have had only three or four days of training , ” he explained			1
“ we could see it , especially for me - it was really hard for me physically and i did n’t feel really well in the game but it is okay as i have this week to work because we have to be ready against @entity44			2
i have asked to work hard ( in training )			0
for pre-season preparation you have to work hard and there is less than one week to be ready			0
” @entity2 ’s pre-season preparation also saw them take a squad to face @entity63 in the @entity64 , with most players who were involved on @entity36 duty excused from making the trip			0
@entity1 feels there is an obvious gap in fitness levels between those players who have been back in training for a longer period but is backing @entity31 ’s side to have a great season once everyone is up to scratch			1
“ i did n’t got to @entity76 , along with a lot of players , so we are at a different stage so it is hard to value our potential but when we are fit and all together we will do fantastic things , ” he said			2
celebration time : @entity1 lifts the @entity85 up with his team - mates after beating @entity87 in may hot streak : @entity1 has proved to be a force on the international scene too “ we just have to work at our training and we have a fantastic test on sunday , we will be ready i think because we want to win this first trophy			1
” @entity31 is not concerned about @entity1 ’s fitness and put his display on sunday down to a lack of rest			2
“ today at least he was not ready at all , ” @entity31 said after the game			0
“ he had only three weeks rest , it was not an eternity and he had to come back quickly			0
but sometimes when you come back late you want to work hard and in a game you are not as sharp			0
“ it ’s nothing about him			0
he ’s not put weight on , he ’s not out of shape , he ’s worked very hard this week and not recovered from the work he has done			0
” after the @entity109 showdown against @entity44 , the @entity9 get their @entity6 campaign up and running at home to @entity112 before the first - leg of their @entity115 qualifier			2
