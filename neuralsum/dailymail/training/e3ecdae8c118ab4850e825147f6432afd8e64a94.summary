by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:38 pm on 29th february 2012 the mother of a six - year - old boy with meningitis has been criticised after being left to fund a £ 20,000 pair of artificial legs for her meningitis - struck son following an admin blunder			1
@entity10 , six , was due to pick up his latest set of high - tech limbs from a clinic in @entity14 this week after growing out of his old ones			1
but his family were shocked to discover the @entity17 will no longer pay for the private clinic because the same prosthetics are available closer to their home in @entity21 , @entity22			2
furious : @entity24 said her son could not afford to wait two weeks for alternative @entity17 limbs as his legs and pelvis will tighten			2
the @entity17 funded his first pair of legs from a private centre since 2009 ( right ) @entity10 ’s mother @entity34 , 45 , said they have no choice but to pay the £ 20,000 bill themselves because any delay could harm his progress			1
she said : ' it ’s just a mess , a complete shambles			2
there ’s been a lack of communication and i ca n’t cancel this now			2
' @entity10 is desperate for new limbs as he has grown so much			1
the old ones hurt him			0
' the new legs have been made and he ’s expecting them			0
he ’s been doing so wonderfully			0
' even waiting two weeks and his legs and pelvis will tighten			0
it ’s a lot of money but we will have to find it			0
' @entity10 lost his legs due to severe septicaemia after being struck down with meningitis b at 18 months old , and now needs new artificial limbs each year			1
he also has a severe visual impairment			0
struggle : @entity10 lost his legs to severe septicaemia when he was just 18 months old ( pictured ) @entity17 @entity21 has funded @entity10 ’s care at the private specialist centre in @entity14 since 2009 , after his parents mounted a campaign			1
they apologised that a letter informing the @entity69 of the changes had not reached them before the private clinic told them			0
@entity17 @entity21 says @entity10 can receive an alternative set of limbs from the city ’s @entity74 within two weeks of assessment			1
mrs @entity77 said that was ' too long ' to wait for her son , whose prosthetics are hurting him because they are too small			0
@entity83 , @entity21 assistant director of commissioning , said : ' i ’m sorry that @entity86 and mrs @entity77 did n’t receive our letter before they had the phone call from the private provider in @entity14			0
' she said a letter explaining the decision and inviting the family to discuss @entity10 ’s needs has been sent			1
@entity10 , pictured here aged 18 months , has fundraised for meningitis charities and met diver @entity98 ms @entity83 said : ' our funding comes from the public purse and so it is good practice to review and check how we make best use of @entity17 money while continuing to provide a quality service for local people			1
' mrs @entity77 said that she intends to appeal the decision to move her son ’s care , adding that the family will have paid for the limbs by the time a letter arrives			0
