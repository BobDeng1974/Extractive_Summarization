by @entity0 published : 18:33 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 15 november 2012 homes across @entity2 are forcibly having water meters installed to meet government targets to cut water usage			1
water companies are now launching a massive programme of installing compulsory water meters across areas prone to water shortage - including much of southern @entity11			1
the step , which amounts to rationing by price , could also be enforced across the rest of the country and could mean soaring bills for millions of families			0
the government hopes introducing water meters into @entity2 homes will ease ' serious water stress ' in key regions last year the government classed the @entity24 as a region of ' serious water stress ' , where water companies were granted the power to make metered households compulsory			1
now @entity29 has announced plans to put a total of 500,000 meters in homes across @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 by 2015 as drought conditions continue			1
this week , the company announced some 75,000 meters will be placed in homes in @entity39 and @entity40 over the next year			2
the move by water companies is an attempt to meet government targets to cut average water use from 148 to 130 litres per person per day by 2030			1
those who use the highest levels of water will be worst affected			0
this includes large families , the disabled and those who regularly water large gardens or wash their cars			0
however , those who tend to use less , such as the elderly and those who live alone , could see their bills reduced			0
the cost of installing a meter runs to Â£ 200 per house , a sum likely to be passed on to consumers			2
around 40 per cent of homes in @entity11 and @entity65 are already metered , which means more than half the population has no connection between the amount of water they use and the size of their bills			1
the current system sees each household without a meter pay a fixed annual sum for their water based on their home 's rateable value			2
those with a meter pay just for the water they use			2
it is expected that 80 per cent of households in @entity11 will pay for water using a meter by 2020			1
@entity91 , @entity29 's director of metering , said : ' as well as helping to secure water resources for the future , metering is the fairest way to charge as people pay for what they use			0
' it puts people in control of their bills			0
' more than 70,000 meters have already been installed in @entity102 since 2010 as part of the company 's five - year plan			0
the @entity35 countryside is one of the areas targeted by the recent plans by @entity29 to introduce 500,000 new meters by 2015 since the equipment was rolled out , 59 per cent of customers reported a reduction in their water bills , while 41 per cent saw an increase			1
' which ? ' warns that households with large families could be hit by soaring bills			0
a spokesman said : ' while some can and do save money from meters , others - particularly large families - may see their bills rise if meters become compulsory			0
' we want to see water companies and regulators considering the impact on all customers before making sweeping changes to the charging system			1
' an 2009 independent report by regulator @entity134 called on the industry regulator @entity136 to drive through the introduction of meters through @entity11 , starting in those areas in the @entity24 which are considered a future drought risk			2
the report says : ' a combination of significant population growth , the effects of climate change and the need to renew what is often @entity146 infrastructure will put increasing pressure on both the availability and the cost of water			1
' we need to tackle these challenges now , before they become major problems			0
the charging system can play an important role in this			0
