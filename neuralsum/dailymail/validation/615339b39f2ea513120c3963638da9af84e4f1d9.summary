@entity0 can become one of the great international players if he starts to add more goals to his game , according to @entity6 manager @entity5			1
@entity5 believes that the @entity8 midfielder , who takes on @entity9 on sunday and is tipped to take over the captaincy from @entity11 next season , is only a step away from becoming an exceptional player , with the @entity6 manager delighted at @entity0 's progress after he was lambasted for picking @entity0 for @entity17			1
@entity5 said : ' his rise has been fairly meteoric as well			1
it was n't so long ago that i picked him for @entity17 and that decision was vilified			0
people were saying he was n't getting into the @entity8 team and he was being described as a waste of money			1
@entity5 believes @entity0 could become one of the great international players the @entity6 manager wants @entity0 to start adding more goals to his game ' then he went to the under - 21 tournament a year later and got an awful lot of criticism captaining the @entity32			1
no - one had a good word to say about him			0
so his rise has been quite meteoric , even though he 's been round a long time			1
' it 's only the last year that people are starting to say : " actually , this boy 's a good player "			2
this lad has a lot of qualities			0
and of course i think , as time goes on , the responsibility he 's been given at @entity8 now by @entity45 will help him			1
@entity8 's success will rub off on him as well as he 's been an important part of it			1
' i think we 'll see him get better and better and that 's what we hope			2
he ceratinly has enough qualities that i do n't think he needs to be hung up on goal - scoring			0
he 'll always be around the national team for the many other qualities he has			0
if he starts to add goals as well , then you 're talking about someone who is exceptional			0
' @entity0 has scored some crucial goals for @entity8 , including the winner at @entity65 @entity0 ( right ) in training as @entity8 prepare to take on rivals @entity9 on sunday and though @entity5 hopes that @entity0 does succeed @entity11 as @entity8 captain , he says it wo n't make any difference to his role in the @entity6 team , where he is already considered one of the senior players			1
' if @entity45 does make him captain , great and we 'll all be happy			0
if he does n't it wo n't affect his leadership qualities as far as i 'm concerned			0
he 's in our leadership group			0
he 'll still be someone who needs to take on leadership responsibilities when he comes to @entity6			2
if he does that , coming as @entity84 does , as captain of his club team , that 's great			2
if he does n't because @entity45 chooses someone else that does n't affect me			0

@entity5 believes @entity0 can become an @entity6 great
@entity6 manager described @entity0 's rise as ' meteoric '
@entity0 has been in *excellent* form for @entity8 this season
