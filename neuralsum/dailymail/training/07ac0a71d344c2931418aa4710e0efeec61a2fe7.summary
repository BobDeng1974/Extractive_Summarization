@entity0 forward @entity1 has defended himself against accusations he has wildly unrealistic expectations after turning down two moves during the transfer window			1
the @entity6 rejected both @entity7 , with whom he had a successful loan spell last season , earlier in the summer before turning down @entity11 in the closing hours of the window on monday			1
@entity11 claimed they were unable to match the 23 - year - old 's wage demands , with reports suggesting he wanted £ 90,000 - a - week			1
that sum does not include the £ 10million invested in @entity36 , who was immediately loaned back to @entity38 club @entity37			2
however , former @entity39 trainee @entity1 has hit back			2
reflection : @entity1 takes to @entity41 to discuss a crazy transfer deadline day for him personally proud : @entity1 says he believes he took control of the situation unlike others proud : @entity1 is happy with the final outcome as he remains a @entity0 player beyond the transfer window ' finally the madness is finished ! ' he wrote on @entity41			1
' i protected the man and the player that i am today , taking all the responsibility of the situation and for people who did n't want it			0
' and i 'm very happy with myself to have taken such an important decision ! ' @entity1 was @entity30 ' first signing at @entity28 in the summer of 2012 , at a cost of £ 10.5million , having previously worked with him in @entity39 's youth team and during a loan spell at @entity62			1
however , injuries have dogged his time on @entity65 and he scored just two goals in his maiden season before moving to @entity7 for the 2013 - 14 season , where he became something of a favourite on @entity71			2
he scored in both games against arch - rivals @entity73 , including a brilliant winner in the @entity76 encounter			0
value : @entity0 wanted a return on the £ 12m they spent on @entity1 , rather than letting him leave on loan the @entity7 had a £ 14million bid accepted by @entity0 in july but @entity1 rejected a move and , even with his options limited , he refused the escape route offered by @entity11 after a £ 10million fee was agreed			1
while @entity1 considers what lies ahead for him @entity30 ' final summer signing @entity32 will be looking for a long run in the side having made his debut in sunday 's 3 - 0 win at @entity92			1
defender @entity93 made his comeback in that game after nine months out with injury and he is relishing playing alongside the @entity98 striker			0
' everyone knows that @entity32 has all the qualities to be one of the best strikers in the world , ' he told liverpoolfc.com			0
' he knows this is an amazing chance for him at play for @entity0 and i think he 's going to do really well			0
' during the time he 's been with us i 've talked with him a lot and inside the dressing room he 's been really good			0
' hopefully what we saw on the pitch at @entity92 is what he 'll be like all season			0
he can make a real impact			0

@entity1 was close to *joining* both @entity7 and @entity11 in the transfer window
however the @entity6 rejected offers on the table from both clubs
@entity11 claimed they could n't match @entity1 's wage demands reportedly as high as £ 90,000 - a - week
@entity1 says he is very happy with the important decision he has now made
