by @entity1 reporter published : 12:39 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 12 april 2013 a life without cell phones , @entity4 or @entity5 may seem a daunting prospect to many of us , but in the town of @entity12 , @entity13 , where every electronic device is banned , the residents like it that way			1
the remote town of just 147 people in the @entity17 falls in the @entity18 , where wireless is banned across 13,000 square miles			1
the ban is in place to minimize disturbance next to the @entity23 , home to the world 's largest steerable radio telescope			1
while it may seem like an undesirable destination for today 's tech - savvy citizens , many people are moving to the area as they believe it is better for their health			1
silence : residents living near the @entity23 in the @entity18 in @entity12 , @entity13 are banned from using phones or wireless devices to lower interference @entity39 is just one of the residents who believes she suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity , or @entity42 , which leaves her in pain whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies			1
@entity39 explained to @entity45 that before she and her husband escaped to @entity12 in 2007 , she lived in @entity47 , @entity48 , where she suffered headaches , twitching muscles and chronic pain			1
she first noticed the pains in 2002 when a wireless provider put up a tower near their farm			1
' i was extremely tired , but i could n't sleep at night , ' she told @entity45			2
' i got a rash , i had hair loss , my skin was wrinkled , and i just thought it was something i ate , or getting older			2
' she soon began to connect the pains with triggers - mobile phones , driving past signal towers - but the phone company dismissed her claims , even though she has no doubt of the cause			2
' i 'll say , " oh , i have a headache , " and then someone 's cellphone will ring , ' she said			2
relief : @entity39 , pictured with her husband @entity74 , said that whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies she suffers headaches , twitching muscles and chronic pain , but these have eased in @entity12 they found out about the @entity18 in 2007 and when they visited , she immediately began to feel better - so they sold half of their farmland and made the move			1
in their new home , they use a landline and an @entity91 - connected computer which does not have @entity5			0
they have struggled to find a refrigerator with low enough emissions , so fill up on ice instead			0
zone : the area is 13,000 square miles and 147 people live in the town of @entity12 ' life is n't perfect here , ' she said			1
' there 's no grocery store , no restaurants , no hospital nearby			0
but here , at least , i 'm healthy			0
i 'm not in bed with a headache all the time			0
' while she is not alone - she believes 36 others like her have moved to the area to escape electronics - the condition is not recognized by the @entity116			1
around five per cent of @entity117 believe they have @entity42 , but the @entity116 has not connected the symptoms with exposure - and there is only brittle scientific evidence			0
' @entity42 has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link @entity42 symptoms to @entity127 ( electromagnetic field ) exposure , ' the @entity116 states			2
' further , @entity42 is not a medical diagnosis , nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem			0
' @entity134 , a psychologist at @entity135 , added that he has carried out extensive studies but found sufferers could not always tell when there were blasted with electromagnetic frequencies compared to harmless ones			2
' it is definitely the case that some people experience symptoms that they attribute to electromagnetic frequencies , ' he told @entity45			1
' but is it really these frequencies causing the symptoms ? at the moment , we can say that there simply is n't any robust evidence to support that			0
' rural : @entity39 said that other residents were not very welcoming to @entity42 sufferers but she has no choice other residents of @entity12 are also skeptical of those who say they have @entity42 , @entity39 said			1
they are reluctant to rent out their homes to them in case they ask for special treatment			0
she added that after she asked the town to remove florescent lights at the community center , she has had packages stolen from her porch and was told : ' we do n't want your kind here			0
' although she said she sometimes feels discriminated against , she said she has no plans to move			0
' i can be outdoors			0
i can go to church , i can attend some celebrations , i can be with people , ' she said			2
' living here allows me to be more of a normal person			0
