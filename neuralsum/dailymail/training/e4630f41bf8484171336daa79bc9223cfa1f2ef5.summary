by @entity0 they are the horrific pictures which prove that a mysterious spate of dolphin deaths along the northern @entity4 of @entity5 have nothing to do with natural causes			1
this bottlenose dolphin was found dead along the coastline of @entity10 after being shot			2
when investigators examined the mammal , they found a bullet inside its body			2
it is one of a number of dolphins which have washed ashore along the northern @entity4 over the past few months			1
this is a bottlenose dolphin which was found dead in the water - a bullet wound can be seen bottom left cruel : federal officials say they are looking into the mysterious deaths			2
this is a close - up of the bullet wound on the bottlenose dolphin , left			2
this bullet , right , was found inside the dolphin some have had bullet wounds while others have had missing jaws and hacked off fins			1
the most recent case was of a dolphin found dead off the coast of @entity10 , its lower jaw missing			1
the situation is so serious that federal officials are now looking into the mysterious deaths			2
officials from the @entity47 are asking everyone from beachgoers to fishermen to wildlife agents to be on the lookout for injured or dead dolphins - and any unusual interaction between the mammals and people			1
' it 's very sad to think that anyone could do that to any animal , ' said @entity61 , a marine mammal scientist for @entity47 's southeast office in @entity64 , @entity65			0
' there have been some obviously intentional cases			0
' @entity61 said five dolphins have been found shot			1
in @entity70 , two were shot in 2011 and one in 2012			0
and in @entity10 , three were found shot this year , the most recent one last week , which was first reported by the @entity73 newspaper			0
slain : a horrific photo of a dead bottlenose dolphin taken in late september in @entity70 shows it after shot on @entity78 investigation : the @entity81 - based @entity80 said it is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever harmed the dolphins besides the shootings , a dolphin in @entity89 was found with a screwdriver stuck in its head over the summer			1
another in @entity89 had its tail cut off , and that animal survived			0
still others were missing fins or had cuts to their bodies			1
' i think it is outrageous , ' said @entity102 , the executive director of @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity10			0
' these animals are very docile , very friendly and they 're very curious			0
' they come close to the boats , so if you 're out there , you 'll see them riding the bows			0
and their curiosity and friendship brings them so close that they become targets and that 's the unfortunate thing			0
' dolphins are among the species protected by the 1972 @entity120			1
violators can be fined up to $ 10,000 per violation and sent to prison for a year			0
the @entity81 - based @entity80 said it is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whomever harmed the dolphins			1
increasing : the @entity103 , seen during an unrelated dolphin rescue , says that the barbaric attacks have increased lately while having first seen early this year the gruesome discoveries are heartbreaking for @entity4 scientists , who follow the population			1
@entity61 said that two months before the 2010 oil spill disaster off the coast of @entity70 , dolphins began stranding themselves and that there were unusually high mortality rates - possibly due to a cold winter that year			1
since then , the spill and another cold winter in 2011 have contributed to several deaths within the @entity4 's dolphin population , experts say			1
investigators have also found discolored teeth and lung infections within some of the dead dolphins			1
since february 2010 , experts have tallied more than 700 recorded dolphin deaths			0
experts have also found increased ' human interaction ' cases , which include dolphins tangled in fishing lines - and the more violent incidents			1
@entity61 cautions that some of the dolphin mutilations might have happened after the animal died from natural causes and washed ashore			1
she said that in the case of the dolphin with the lower jaw missing , someone could have cut off the jaw for a souvenir after the animal died			1
' we have to do a necropsy on the animal and collect tissue samples to try to determine whether or not the injury was pre-or post-mortem ' she said			0
attacks : bodies of dolphins found with gunshot wounds , slashes , missing jaws and in one case a stabbing by a screw driver has launched an investigation along the @entity4 ( file photo ) she also said that the increase in cases might be due to @entity47 's dolphin stranding network becoming better trained to notice cruelty cases or unusual deaths			1
some have suggested that the deaths are the work of a few angry fishermen who are upset about bait - stealing dolphins			2
yet the majority of fishermen say that while dolphins can be annoying , they would n't harm the creatures			2
' i do n't know who to suspect ... i was really sickened when i read about it , ' said @entity206 , of @entity207 out of @entity208 , @entity10 , and head of the @entity210 , said he 's never had a problem with dolphins			2
the mammals tend to swim behind his boat until a fish too small to keep is tossed over the side			0
' you 'll see him under your boat , ' @entity206 said , about the dolphin			0
' he 'll get it before it can reach the bottom			0
i usually leave the area if they 're doing that			0
' fougeres said she does n't think the dolphins are being targeted by a gang of people or even by a lone , sick individual			2
' the cases are fairly spread apart , ' she said			0
' i do n't think there is one dolphin murderer out there			0

other dolphins which have washed ashore along northern @entity4 have had missing jaws and hacked off fins
