by @entity0 published : 07:08 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 19:59 est , 19 april 2013 the controversial speaker of the @entity2 has refused to reveal details of how he apparently avoided paying tax on his multi-million - pound grace - and - favour residence			1
@entity6 , who lives in the luxurious taxpayer - funded @entity8 property with his equally controversial wife @entity9 , previously paid more than £ 4,000 a year because it was considered a ‘ taxable benefit ’			1
but this tax bill was mysteriously cut to zero in 2010/11 , it has emerged			0
when asked for an explanation , the speaker , who earns £ 140,000 a year , refused to explain his tax arrangements			1
commons speaker @entity6 has signed an exemption certifiate which means details of his tax bill for the flat can not be released mr @entity6 – who stood for his office promising greater transparency – used an obscure piece of parliamentary legislation to avoid answering			1
he claimed that to reveal his tax arrangements would ‘ prejudice ’ his position as speaker but critics said he risked ‘ tarnishing the reputation of @entity32 ’			2
mr @entity6 and his wife live rent - free in @entity29 ’s @entity2 , part of the @entity8			2
it has a magnificent @entity38 - style dining room and a state bedroom traditionally used by monarchs the night before their coronation			2
within weeks of taking residence in june 2009 , he and his wife ordered refurbishments costing £ 45,000			1
as with any staff member granted a home by their employer , mr @entity6 is liable to pay tax either on its value or – if it is judged indispensable to their work – an amount equal to a share of the running costs			0
he was granted the latter arrangement – the same as the prime minister and @entity58 have for their grace - and - favour @entity60 flats – and , according to the @entity2 accounts , was asked to pay £ 4,300 in 2009 - 10			1
but in the following year ’s figures , the bill mysteriously disappears			0
the account states that : ‘ the speaker ’s official residence is provided in conjunction with his @entity2 duties			2
in 2009/10 the accommodation benefit assessable to tax was £ 4,300			1
discussions with @entity74 concluded that no taxable benefit arose in 2010/11			1
’ in response to a @entity78 request by the @entity79 to reveal details of the tax arrangement , mr @entity6 took the unusual step of issuing a certificate that effectively exempted this information from normal rules			0
@entity86 , wife of speaker of the house of commons @entity6 , caused a stir when she was pictured in the window of the speaker 's residence overlooking the @entity92 this defence is normally subject to a public interest test , but the speaker has the power to sign a certificate which is taken as conclusive proof he has reached a ‘ reasonable opinion ’			1
the information commissioner ’s office said it has no power to challenge mr @entity6 ’s decision			0
@entity104 mp @entity103 said : ‘ this is a matter of great concern			0
there are question marks in this case and they should be explained			0
the speaker ca n’t be above other @entity110 or the rest of the country			2
if the speaker is n’t open about this it risks tarnishing the reputation of @entity32			2
’ @entity116 , of the @entity117 , said : ‘ the @entity2 is relying on a power of veto which allows it to evade accountability to avoid embarrassment			0
’ @entity123 , chief executive of the @entity124 ’ @entity122 , said mr @entity6 was attempting to exempt himself from the same scrutiny that other @entity110 face			0
‘ it ’s completely inappropriate for the speaker to make the final judgment over whether legitimate questions about his own taxpayer - funded perks are of public interest or not , ’ he said , adding that mr @entity6 ’s actions appeared to be ‘ a blatant attempt to shut down a perfectly reasonable investigation ’			1
the @entity78 request also revealed that the @entity136 , @entity137 , paid tax on his grace - and - favour residence in 2009 - 10 but paid nothing in 2010 - 11			1
@entity74 said : ‘ accommodation provided by an employer is generally taxable unless certain conditions are met : where it is provided for special security reasons , or it is necessary for the performance of the employee ’s duties			1
’ mr @entity6 was elected speaker in the wake of the @entity110 ’ expenses scandal			0
it was then revealed he had ‘ flipped ’ the designation of his second home when he sold two houses , allowing him to avoid capital gains tax			0
he denied wrongdoing but paid back £ 6,508 to the taxman .			0

commons speaker used powers to block release of talks with @entity74
*spectacular* flat with views of the @entity92 comes with the *job*
he *incurred* a taxable benefit of £ 4,300 in 2009 - 10 but nothing since
