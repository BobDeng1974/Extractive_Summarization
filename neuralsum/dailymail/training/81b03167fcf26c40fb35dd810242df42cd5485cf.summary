this is the unusual orphaned lamb who understands the true meaning of being a sheep dog			0
@entity4 was just weeks old when he realised that his ambition was not to frolic in the fields with his woolly friends - it was to be a puppy			2
now he lives in a kennel , eats dog biscuits and likes nothing more than a long walk in the countryside with his owners			1
now that just takes the biscuit ! @entity4 the sheep was taken in by @entity18 and her husband @entity19 , pictured , and raised on their smallholding alongside the couple 's seven dogs baa - king : @entity4 looks rather funny eating dog treats with his canine friends walkies ! the 18 - month - old was bottle - reared by the @entity29 and slept in a kennel while growing up @entity4 was bottle - reared by @entity18 and @entity31 at their smallholding in @entity34 - on - @entity35 , @entity36 , from after he was orphaned at just a few days old			1
the 18 - month - old , 200lb animal was originally allowed in the house , and now lives outside in a kennel along with six dogs belonging to the farm			1
mrs @entity18 , 42 , said : ' @entity4 definitely thinks he ’s a dog - he always has			1
' he will eat absolutely anything we give him but his favourite food is dog biscuits			1
when we take the dogs for a walk , he thinks nothing of coming along with us			0
unique character : mrs @entity18 said the 200lb animal is very popular with children in the village of @entity34 - on - @entity35 fish out of water : @entity4 chose to act like a dog , but he could just as easily have decided to mimic the farm 's donkeys , geese , ducks or cats ' he ’s become quite a popular figure with the people in the village , especially the children			1
they seem to love him			0
' @entity68 is also home to a @entity71 terrier @entity72 , seven ; @entity73 - may , five ; three - year - old @entity74 ; @entity77 , two ; and @entity77 / @entity71 terrier cross @entity75 , also two			0
they have now been joined by @entity79 , a nine - month - old @entity80			1
and the menagerie does not stop with @entity4 and the dogs			2
@entity84 pet : @entity4 was raised alongside the couple 's six dogs , who include a @entity71 terrier , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity77 and a @entity80 born to be different : the couple 's grandson @entity91 feeding @entity4 and another lamb when they were young the @entity29 also have three donkeys , including nine - week - old @entity96 , geese , ducks and cats			1
mr @entity31 has owned the smallholding for 20 years and they have lived there for 10 years			0
mrs @entity18 said : ' bearing in mind @entity79 is only nine months old , she took to @entity4 straight away and he is great with her and all the other dogs , just getting on and doing the things they do			2
' i suppose some people might see having a pet sheep as a bit strange but we do n’t see it that way			0
to us , he ’s just part of the farm			0
' the fact that he thinks he ’s a dog at the same time just adds a little eccentricity			2
' the other dogs accept him as one of theirs and he seems perfectly happy			0
' we are used to all these animals running around anyway so why not have a sheep joining in the fun , too ? '			0

the 18 - month - old eats dog biscuits and takes walks with his owners
