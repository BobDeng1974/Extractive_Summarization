by @entity0 published : 04:21 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 04:21 est , 22 april 2013 bandage dresses have never graced the rails of my wardrobe , or the contours of my size 14 , post-baby body			1
for , while the skin - tight dresses are a favourite of svelte celebrities like @entity13 and @entity14 , they do n't seem to have been designed with the lumps and bumps of ordinary women ( or the practicalities of our daily lives ) in mind			1
yet now a new bandage dress , which has sparked long waiting lists in the @entity25 boutiques which sell it and has reportedly attracted a following from celebrity mothers such as @entity29 , seems to have been designed with mums in mind			1
the 's ' dress ( the letter stands for ' shape ' , something i 'm certainly keen to reclaim , 21 months after the birth of my son , @entity38 ) by fashion label @entity39 , claims to help its wearer drop a dress size , while being made of machine - washable , crease - resistant material			1
dropping a dress size : @entity0 modelling the @entity39 's ' dress with 21 - month - old son @entity38 could this be just the thing to take body - conscious mums from playdate to dinner party ? it certainly sounds too good to be true : a designer dress that not only gives you a perfect silhouette , but does n't require splashing out on dry - cleaning bills			1
it just peels down over your body and supposedly works its magic			2
and , since having @entity38 , my wardrobe could certainly do with some sparkle			2
embarrassed by my weight gain , i 've assumed the shapeless and sombre disguise worn by thousands of new mums all over the country			1
during pregnancy , my nausea was only kept under control by @entity70 sandwiches and the promptness of the delivery men at the local @entity74 takeaway			2
as a result , my stomach resembles the sort of thing parents hire for children to bounce on at parties , while my once - pert bottom has dropped a few inches and my boobs have been left somewhat deflated - which after years of dreaming of a smaller cup size is a massive anti-climax			1
so being confronted with a rainbow array of super-tight dresses on the brand 's website was , frankly , terrifying			0
could a 39 - year - old mother really wear something spray - on and above the knee ? appropriate ? can a 39 - year - old mother really wear something spray - on and above - the - knee ? comfort : all of the garments are without zips , buttons or labels - no busting , no straining i selected four dresses to road test - a bright green , sleeveless dress with a black waistband , a long - sleeved blue , a ruffled black and a tan dress - which all looked beautiful on the website			1
yet , when the parcel arrived , i was utterly horrified			0
for , while the manufacturers promise the dresses help make the wearer appear a size smaller , it seemed to be the dresses themselves which looked shockingly tiny			0
' each garment is made with 28 per cent elastane , which creates a slimming effect and the garment appears a size smaller			0
' this was certainly true			0
i gasped in horror when i unpacked the minute dresses , checking and rechecking the labels in case i 'd accidentally been given an extra small instead of the large i 'd ordered to cover my generous size 14 bottom			0
nope , the label said large			0
i 'd have to take a deep breath and squeeze myself in head first			0
' all garments are without any zips , buttons or labels , ' says the blurb			0
there is no danger of busting any zips or straining any button holes , which was a relief			0
' the fabric slips around the body , very much like lingerie , ' claims the marketing blurb			0
well , i certainly did n't slip into the first one i tried on , a ruffled black number , but instead spent ten minutes furiously wrestling it over my curves			1
and after some vigorous tugging , the ' lingerie ' the dress most resembled ? @entity157 control knickers			1
while i love the shaping underwear , a @entity157 - style dress felt a little claustrophobic			1
this was probably down to the fabric , which had a neoprene feel to it , like a wetsuit			0
but the rubbery , tight structure of the dress was n't necessarily a bad thing , i decided , thinking it could even pass as sexy , in a kinky , @entity171 sort of way			1
i ventured to the lounge to showcase my new look to my husband , @entity175 , wondering if it would distract him from @entity177			0
you can be plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour ' you look nice , honey , ' he commented quite enthusiastically			0
' that reminds me , i need to get the air pressure in the tyres checked			0
' the next day - after discarding a beige version of the dress which drained all the colour from my pale skin - i donned a long - sleeved blue version of the dress and took my new look to the streets			1
after all , the garments claim to have been designed to take you from day to night , season to season			2
' it is perfect for all climates , ' enthuses model @entity199 , designer @entity202 's muse , on the @entity204 website			0
' i took it to @entity206 , @entity207 , and now it is my dream dress in @entity210			2
' but how would it fare going from @entity212 's to a toddler play date , to my mother - in - law 's house for dinner ... on a rainy , grey day in @entity219 ? well , true to the manufacturer 's words , it did n't crease - even when i ended up crouching on the floor , still damp from a recent downpour , to play with a train set with a group of grubby two - year - olds			1
and when @entity38 decided to decorate me with hummus and @entity230 triangles at my in - laws ' house , a quick scrub with a damp cloth had me as good as new			2
as my final test , i chucked it into the washing machine with the family laundry , at 30 degrees centigrade as advised , and hoped for the best			0
i would n't normally dare put a £ 360 designer garment in with football socks or juice - stained pyjamas , but it re-emerged perfect			1
and , miraculously , the no - ironing promise held up			2
i let the dress dry on a hanger and the next day it looked pristine			2
so , have mums found a bandage dress which can flatter a mummy tummy and survive the sticky fingers of messy toddlers ? the bright colours and flattering cuts certainly add a little va - va - voom while you vacuum , and the wipe - clean material means that you can be rolled on , jumped on and plastered with plasticine and still be ready for cocktail hour in the blink of an eye			1
and , most importantly of all ? the body - shaping fabric whittles a waist and lifts a bottom that has seen better days , making the wearer look , if not a dress size smaller , then certainly more shapely			1
which , for this mum , is worth the hefty price tag			0

new ' @entity157 - style ' bandage dress from @entity274 comes in at a whopping £ 360
