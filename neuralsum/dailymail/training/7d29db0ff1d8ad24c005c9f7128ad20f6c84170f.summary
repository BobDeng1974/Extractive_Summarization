dieters all have their own theories on which strategy works but according to psychologists , joining a slimming group is the best way to lose weight			0
researchers found that the support received at such groups led to dieters losing three times as much as those attending groups supervised by medical professionals			0
the study also found that those attending slimming classes , such as @entity20 , lose double the amount of weight than those who followed a strict weight - loss programme set up by a doctor			1
those following a @entity20 diet plan lost three times as much weight as those seeking medical advice the findings suggest that inspiration from someone who has personally had weight - loss success is often more successful than medical programmes set up by @entity37			2
group classes which encourage members to share experiences and reach a ‘ goal weight ’ proved particularly successful , it was said			0
in the trial , 141 overweight and obese men and women were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of weight loss treatment by a health professional , or 48 weeks of @entity20 , or a combined treatment consisting of 12 weeks of the former then 36 weeks of the latter			1
the investigators assumed that the combined treatment would produce better weight losses than @entity20 alone , but contrary to expectations , @entity20 participants had lost more weight at the end of treatment			1
those participating in the study who used @entity20 lost the most weight in fact , more than one third of the @entity20 participants lost 10 per cent or more of their starting weight , compared to 15 per cent of those in the combined group and 11 per cent in the professionally - led group			2
the trial , run by @entity67 , was the first to compare professionally - delivered group - based behavioural weight - loss treatment to @entity20 , which is led by trained peer counsellors who have achieved their own weight loss			1
@entity20 was chosen because it is the largest commercial slimming programme in the @entity73 and is behaviourally - oriented , focusing on changing eating habits and doing more exercise to lose weight			2
@entity77 , assistant professor of psychology at @entity79 in the @entity67 , who led the trial , said : ‘ this study is important because , with almost 70 per cent of @entity73 adults classified as overweight or obese , there is a need to provide practical treatment solutions that are effective , accessible , and affordable			1
‘ results of this study demonstrate that the @entity20 program can produce clinically meaningful weight losses			1
’ a spokesman for @entity20 said : ‘ @entity20 provides state - of - the - art weight - management services that are as good as the standard behaviour therapy delivered by healthcare professionals			0
‘ and @entity20 costs less , is fully scalable and is usually more convenient to participate in			0
’ the study , funded by the @entity94 , is published in the journal @entity96 .			0

@entity73 study showed that group - based weight loss is the most effective
the clinical trials found that group - based treatment led by peer counselors is just as effective as that led by health professionals
findings could mean weight loss treatment becomes more available for *thousands* of @entity73
results also showed that better meeting attendance was associated with greater weight losses during the first *24* weeks in all treatment
