@entity0 has now been revealed to sell holocaust denial and white supremacist literature			2
the online retailer has been shown to sell books denying the holocaust and promoting anti-semitism and the superiority of the white race with titles such as @entity10 of the @entity11 and building a @entity12			1
the books and ebooks are on sale even in countries that ban such texts , according to an investigation by the kernel – which first uncovered the hateful holocaust denial screeds			2
shameful : it has now been revealed that online retailer @entity0 sells holocaust denial books despite reportedly removing the volumes of violent and horrifying sex - related works disclosed last week from its digital stacks , the online retailer still has a long way to go before cleansing itself of other vile titles			1
some of the @entity31 denial books are even on sale in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , according to @entity36 , countries whose laws ban such literature			1
the texts are also illegal in @entity42 , where @entity0 maintains a @entity44 headquarters to reduce tax burden , @entity36 noted			0
unlike the rape , bestiality and incest titles disclosed last week , many of these books can be found by searching for them			1
shoppers unable to track down their favorite racist titles can also find them in the trusty ' customers who bought this item also bought ' product carousel			1
the racist diatribes were first removed from the online retailer ’s virtual shelves in 2009 after the @entity0 @entity35 was sued by the @entity60 for stocking at least 50 @entity31 denial books , according to the kernel – but the tide of discrimination appears to have come back in			1
holocaust denial : just the latest hateful topic covered by @entity0 's vast digital stacks do n't know where to look ? @entity0 can help : the online retailer even suggests hate - filled books for people unable to find them on their own among the @entity31 denial books is did @entity73 ? the preview questions the validity of claims of gas chambers and alleges many survivor stories have been made up			1
‘ the @entity79 has confessed that the " gas chamber " shown to tourists is fake , ’ the preview says			0
later adding that ‘ eyewitness survivor ’ memoirs , including that of @entity84 have been forged			0
’ the preview ends saying ‘ the story was made up			0
’ there is also a series of books titled ‘ @entity91 , ' which prominently feature the @entity93 symbol , atop the @entity94 on the cover of every volume			1
ebooks with titles such as dissecting the @entity31 : the @entity99 , @entity10 of the @entity11 and @entity100 : the case against the @entity102 of @entity103 populate the collection			2
‘ it reads as exciting as a crime novel , ’ the preview for the first title mentioned above says			0
‘ this is the intellectual adventure of the 21st century			0
’ the @entity109 : jewish @entity110 with @entity111 , is another title in the ‘ @entity91 ’ series found in a separate @entity115 investigation			0
there 's more : these are just two of the many holocaust denial titles for sale on @entity0 other holocaust denial titles include @entity121 : the @entity122			2
rumor and reality and @entity124			0
the sole purpose of ' @entity121 ' is to disprove the possibility that any @entity110 people were ever gassed as the infamous concentration camp			0
among some of the more eye - opening anti-semitic titles in the @entity0 store are @entity133 , expanded , and @entity134 of the @entity135			1
the @entity133 of @entity136 blames the @entity110 people for the slave trade , among other accusations , according to @entity36			0
as before , many of these books are @entity141 - only , but this time some of them , including ‘ conspiracy ’ are also available in hard cover and paperback			1
two more : despite its innocuous title , @entity145 is as hateful as any book on the site @entity115 ’s own investigation also uncovered several white supremacist - promoting materials with the following titles			1
@entity152 and @entity12 , the @entity153 , and @entity145 , which – despite its innocuous title – is actually the latest in a series of writing to which the two books named just before it belong			2
the @entity153 ’s description boasts that is banned in @entity160 and is ‘ considered as most dangerous literature for modern liberal values			2
’ the description further states that some ‘ areas of concern are extremely important to the survival , expansion and advancement of the @entity169 ' are detailed in its pages			0
part of a series : these two books , along with expanding creativity promote an all - white religion with the goal of an all - white world population movies too : the @entity180 ranting extends even to movie reviews the most bizarre of the white supremacist titles , though , is @entity184 's @entity183 to the movies			1
‘ since 2001 , @entity184 ’s witty , pugnacious , and profound film essays and reviews have developed a wide following among cinephiles and @entity192 alike , ’ the book ’s description on @entity0 reads			1
‘ he sees movies without the usual blinders , ’ the description cheerfully proclaims			2
‘ he is quite aware that because @entity197 is controlled by @entity11 , one must typically analyze movies for their propaganda value			0
’ mr @entity184 ’s review of summer blockbuster ‘ @entity201 ’ calls it ‘ another @entity110 wet dream ’ before saying that ‘ hateful fantasies about teaming up with blacks to harm whites are staples of the @entity110 imagination			0
the movie reviews can be had on the @entity141 , in soft cover or via hardcover book			1
multiple requests to @entity0 for comment from both @entity36 and @entity115 seeking comment were not returned .			0

the hate - filled literature can be bought in hard copy or paperback , as well as can be *downloaded* to the @entity141
