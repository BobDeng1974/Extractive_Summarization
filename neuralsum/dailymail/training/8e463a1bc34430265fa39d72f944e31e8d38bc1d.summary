by @entity0 , deputy political editor for @entity1 @entity2 , the @entity3 chair , said it was ' astonishing ' that the government failed to properly consult the head of the military before making deep defence spending cuts ministers have been accused of putting @entity11 's military at risk by ‘ bungling ’ money - saving army reforms			1
the respected commons ’ @entity3 said it was ‘ astonishing ’ that the @entity16 failed to consult the head of the @entity18 fully before pushing ahead with deep cuts to regular forces			1
it also failed to give proper consideration to whether it was possible for reservist numbers to be almost doubled by 2019 , and it managed to squander millions of pounds through a flawed deal with @entity25			1
the verdict , delivered in the cross-party committee 's report on the controversial army 2020 programme , comes as @entity31 leaders gather in @entity32 for a key summit			1
the scheme is intended to save more than £ 10 billion over a decade , by cutting 20,000 personnel from the regular army and increasing reservist strength to 30,000			1
but the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) has suggested that the recruitment target could take six years longer than planned to hit			2
the committee said it ‘ remained to be convinced ’ that the goal could be reached on time			0
chair @entity2 described the handling of the project so far as ‘ astonishing ’			0
‘ the decision to reduce the size of the @entity18 was driven by the need to make financial savings in a time of austerity , ’ she said			1
‘ however , it is remarkable that the chief of the general staff was not involved in all stages of the decision - making process , given the magnitude and importance of the change required , and its impact on the service which he commands			2
‘ the @entity16 did not test the feasibility of recruiting and training the 30,000 reserve soldiers it needs by 2019			1
the strength of the @entity65 has stayed at around 19,000 for the last two years , and we remain to be convinced that the @entity16 will recruit the required numbers in time			2
‘ the @entity18 told us that shortfalls in recruitment are increasing the risk of capability gaps emerging in some parts of the @entity18 's structure			1
this in turn increases the risk of additional pressure being placed on regular troops			0
’ @entity25 , the private firm brought in to handle recruitment , was said to have brought in just 2,000 reserves in 2013/14 against a target of 6,000			0
the goal for recruitment of regulars was also missed by 30 per cent , according to the committee			0
the company was still awarded its full bonus for recruiting reservists			0
‘ the @entity16 's bungling around the recruitment contract with @entity25 has meant at least £ 70 million of the planned £ 267 million savings from the contract have already been lost , ’ mrs @entity2 said			2
‘ there was no clear understanding of the scale of the recruitment challenge , poor information about potential recruits and the @entity16 did not provide @entity25 with the it infrastructure it needed			0
’ @entity101 mp mrs @entity2 said it was ‘ wholly unacceptable ’ that the government 's @entity103 for the @entity18 seemed to be ‘ to get @entity105 to work ’			1
@entity31 secretary general @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity109 president @entity108 - watching a military fly past in @entity111 , @entity32 , today - have called for @entity113 countries to increase their defence spending the committee heard that contingency plans included extending tours of duty for regular troops , which could affect morale			0
the mps also criticised the @entity16 for failing to provide the @entity38 with information it had requested on time			0
‘ this must not happen again , ’ mrs @entity2 said			0
shadow defence secretary @entity126 said the report showed a ‘ litany of catastrophic failures ’			0
‘ these criticisms are hugely embarrassing for the government during the week that the @entity11 is hosting the @entity31 summit and when @entity107 has called for @entity11 's international partners to meet their defence obligations , ’ he said			2
‘ his advice to the neighbours would be better received and have greater credibility if he had his own house in order			0
’ defence secretary @entity140 said : ‘ the chief of the general staff and i are confident that we will reach our target of 30,000 trained army reservists by 2018/19			1
indeed , we have arrested the many years of decline and neglect that has plagued our reserve forces and now we need to build on that			2
‘ our @entity18 2020 plans are on track and will deliver by 2020 the army we need to counter the wide range of threats we face			1
‘ working closely with the @entity18 and @entity25 , we have already addressed many of the points raised in this report , including streamlining medical and security clearance procedures , with further planned improvements on the medical process , empowering and incentivising local units to recruit , and running a high - profile recruitment campaign			1
‘ this is seeing a steady stream of recruits coming through the door			0
our targets are challenging but they are achievable			0
with a government investment of £ 1.8 billion in better training and equipment , i believe that many young people will realise the great offer we have for challenging and exciting roles in the reserves			1

government reforms to the @entity18 intended to save more than £ 10bn by 2020
20,000 soldiers cut from the army while reserve strength boosted by 30,000
@entity3 said ministers failed to consult @entity18 chief fully
