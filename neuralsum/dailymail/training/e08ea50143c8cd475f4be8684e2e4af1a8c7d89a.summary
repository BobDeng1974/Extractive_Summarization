a plague of superweeds , created as a result of @entity5 farming , has swamped 60million acres of @entity7 farmland , it has been revealed			1
a policy briefing issued by @entity7 ’s @entity9 ( @entity9 ) says it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the weeds in check			1
the plants have developed as an unintended result of growing crops that have been genetically modified to withstand spraying with certain powerful weedkillers , such as @entity17 ’s @entity16 , which is also known as glyphosate			1
file photo : the reality is that the weeds have mutated to become immune to the chemicals with the result they can take over fields the idea was that the fields could be repeatedly sprayed with these chemicals on the basis they would kill the weeds but allow food crops such as soya to thrive			1
however , the reality is that the weeds have mutated to become immune to the chemicals with the result they can take over fields			1
biotech companies have suggested the way to deal with the problem is to develop new strains of @entity5 crop and switch to different , even more powerful , chemical weedkillers			1
the @entity9 study – ‘ the rise of @entity44 – and what to do about it ’ – suggests returning to more natural crops and weed control to defeat the problem			2
author of the report , @entity49 , a senior scientists with the @entity51 , said : ‘ it sounds like a bad sci - fi movie or something out of @entity57			2
but ‘ superweeds ’ are real and they ’re infesting @entity7 ’s croplands			1
‘ overuse of @entity17 ’s ‘ @entity16 ’ seeds and herbicides in our industrial farming system is largely to blame			0
file photo : these weeds steal nutrients from the crops , which reduces yields , overall productivity , and farmers ' profits and if we ’re not careful , the industry ’s proposed ‘ solutions ’ could make this epidemic much worse			1
’ the @entity7 study said as many as 50per cent of @entity7 farmers surveyed report glyphosate - resistant weed infestations			1
in the south east of the country , more than 90per cent of cotton and soybean farmers are affected			0
to date , some 24 species of weeds have developed resistance , with the result farmers are using more chemical sprays than before the @entity5 crops were planted			1
some resistant weeds can grow eight feet tall and the tough stems damage farm equipment			2
removing them by hand is the only way to get rid of them , which is expensive			0
these weeds steal nutrients from the crops , which reduces yields , overall productivity , and farmers ’ profits			2
mr @entity49 said : ‘ @entity17 and other agribusiness companies are now touting herbicide - resistant crops engineered to withstand older , more toxic herbicides , such as dicamba and @entity107 , as the ‘ solution			2
’ ‘ these new herbicides will certainly exacerbate the problem , but increase the companies ’ bottom lines			0
‘ it ’s a highly risky move			0
increased herbicides use on the new engineered crops will speed up weed resistance , leaving no viable herbicide alternatives			0
this is a dangerous chemical cocktail , that when combined with the current farming system , it ’s a recipe for disaster			0
’ he said dicamba and 2,4 - @entity107 pose additional risks to people and nearby crops			0
these herbicides have been linked to increased rates of certain diseases , including @entity131 ’s lymphoma , in farmers and farm workers			0
they are prone to drifting on the wind and dispersing into the air after application , and consequently , the herbicides can settle far from where they were applied			0
these herbicides are extremely toxic to many of the most common fruit and vegetable crops , as well as to plants that provide food and habitat for pollinators and other beneficial insects .			0

the weeds have so far covered 60million acres of @entity7 farmland
they can now withstand certain powerful and commonly used weedkillers
