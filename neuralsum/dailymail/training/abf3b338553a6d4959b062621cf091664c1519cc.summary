she played the corpse in @entity24 's @entity23 , actress @entity25 and @entity27 's @entity26			2
a few days after being approached , the retired civil servant was taken to lunch by film director @entity30			2
ms @entity3 said : ' i was n't sure how to react to being told you would make an ideal dead body			1
' it was all very surreal - and i have to admit assumed the whole thing was a practical joke			2
' but i went with it and had the most amazing time			2
i 've not seen the film yet , but it will be interesting to see what it looks like			0
' i suspect my role will largely be a " blink and you 'll miss it " moment but it 's not every day this happens so you 've just got to go with it when these opportunities come along			1
' my role largely involved lying completely still and half - submerged in a rock pool while i was covered in a plastic sheet			1
' the scene was filmed on @entity54 beach , north - west @entity16 in october last year			2
although not the most glamourous of roles , @entity3 was whisked away for a shopping spree with the film 's designer , who has worked with top stars like @entity60			1

@entity3 , who lives alone in north wales , added : ' it was filmed in this little cove which was just covered with film crew			1

it was not quite a joke like i thought it was			0

' @entity3 admits she had never heard of the a-list @entity11 actors before her filming experience			1
her only instructions were to lie completely still , covered from her hips down in tarpaulin , in a rock pool of water			1
but she was thrilled to find out her on - screen husband was @entity108 , who played @entity109 in the @entity79 television show @entity111			2
it was her near - perfect match with @entity108 which she believes got her the part			2
she said : ' when you saw us together , we looked like a married couple			0
well that 's what i thought anyway			0
' and i think they picked me because i look a bit like a fisherman 's wife			0

i was what they had in mind			0
