by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 must balance his priorities of overturning odds against @entity5 and managing the start of @entity9 's @entity8 fact - finding mission when the @entity10 gets under way in @entity12			1
the captain , one week on after completing the glorious transition of his test summer from certain failure into resounding victory , has already confirmed he will have a new opening partner in @entity19 - and previous incumbent @entity20 will bat at number three , weather permitting on monday			1
yet in almost the same breath , @entity2 acknowledged the elevation of explosive short - format specialist @entity19 may yet be a mere watching brief - with the restoration of @entity20 , in time for the @entity8 early next year , still a fallback option			1
explosive : @entity19 prepares to make his debut in the @entity10 in @entity12 as for his own position , set in stone as @entity9 seek to avoid the untimely upheaval which has beset previous @entity8 preparations , @entity2 insists the identity of his opening partner will entail no significant amendment to his methods			1
as he approaches a five - match , late - summer home series - yet with the modified demands of an impending global tournament in @entity42 and @entity43 very much in mind too - he argues his brief remains a constant , irrespective of opening with @entity19 or @entity20 and their contrasting strike rates of almost 100 or 76			1
' i do n't think it changes my role , ' he said			2
home and dry : @entity2 and @entity53 celebrate their 5th @entity55 win against @entity5 at the @entity56 ' the job of the top four or five is to try and score a hundred , and win the game by setting up the game			1
' you have to try and do it in your way			2
i have got to convert starts into scores			0
that 's the job of an opener			2
' when you win one - day matches , it 's a common theme one of the top four or five has scored a hundred			2
' @entity2 has enhanced his own strike rate since his return to @entity9 's 50 - over team after the @entity75 , but it still pales in comparison to the one @entity19 has established in @entity78 cricket			1
anticipation : @entity19 ' debut at the top of the batting order is drawing in @entity84 levels of excitement he said : ' i still have to strike too - i ca n't let @entity19 do all the scoring			1
' since i have come back into the side , my strike rate has n't been bad - it 's at over 80			0
' @entity20 is the one who must adapt - although , as @entity2 admits , his repositioning may yet not be terminal			1
' there is a different role for @entity20 to play , ' he said			2
' but @entity93 's a world , world - class player			0
so i have no doubts he can do that - and also , if we want to change it ( back ) up at the top of the order , mine and @entity93 's partnership has been a good one over the last couple of years			0
' it 's nice to know we 've got different options , and we 'll look at them over the next few months			0
so that when we come to the @entity8 , we 're very clear on what we think our best side will be			0
' @entity2 has no qualms about describing @entity5 as the likeliest winners over the next two weeks , despite their test humbling and given their pedigree as @entity8 and @entity115 holders - having beaten @entity9 in the @entity117 final of the latter just last year			1
' a change of format will obviously do them good			0
' it 's not quite the same groundhog day for them , probably			0
' we 've got to remember they 're world champions at 50 overs , so they obviously know what they 're doing and will probably go into this as favourites			0
' but if we play well , we 're hard to beat in our conditions			0

@entity2 and @entity19 will opening the batting against @entity5
@entity20 will bat at number three in the @entity10 opener
@entity2 insists one of the tour five has to score a hundred every game
