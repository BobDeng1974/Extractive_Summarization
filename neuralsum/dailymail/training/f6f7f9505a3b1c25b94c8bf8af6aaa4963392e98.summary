a ' killer seagull ' has been spotted dragging pigeons into @entity3 's @entity2 and drowning them before eating the bodies			1
visitors to the central @entity7 park say the hungry bird has taken to grabbing the pigeons by the neck before pulling them into the water			1
it is thought that the same seagull has been spotted on the banks of the @entity2 hunting pigeons and feasting on their remains for the past five years			1
she said : ' it was one of the most violent things i have ever seen - after it happened i felt i had witnessed a murder			0
' i ’ve seen him hunting pigeons on two separate days , both times he picked them off , dragged them into the lake and drowned them			0
' he is easy to spot as he has a distinctive look			0
he is fairly squat and looks muscular , like a bodybuilder			0
it must be the high meat diet he ’s living on			0
' witness : photographer @entity26 , 57 , said the way the seagull killed the pigeon was ' one of the most vicious things ' she had ever seen , and said it had been like watching a murder unusual : bird experts have said that the behaviour is extremely unusual for lesser black - backed gulls - which usually survive on a diet of small fish , aquatic insects and crustaceans the aggressive bird wades into a crowd of pigeons , picks out a straggler , then sprints up and seizes it by the neck			1
it then drags its prey into the @entity2 and drowns it before eating it with his mate			1

birdwatcher , @entity79 , 66 , said he had been observing the menacing gull in the same spot for the past five years			2
' it is one of the strangest things i have ever seen a bird do , ' he said			0
dinner time : after drowning the pigeon in the water , the gull shares its prey with its female mate ' this particular gull has been doing this for at least five years , and the stripped corpses of pigeons are often found on the shore of the lake			1
' mr @entity79 , who writes a blog about the behaviour of birds in @entity3 , said the gull had developed its murderous technique over several years			2
he said : ' the gull began by dropping from the restaurant roof on pigeons flying underneath , but found this inefficient and switched to running at them on the shore			0
' @entity108 ca n’t hunt their prey like hawks , which have powerful feet that can strangle a bird even if it ’s almost as large as they are			0
gulls have weak little webbed feet , that is why they have to drag the bird into the water and drown it			2
' distinctive : park visitors say the bird is fairly squat and looks muscular , ' like a bodybuilder ' repeat offender : the same gull is thought to have been feasting on the pigeons for at least five years , and the stripped corpses of the birds are often found on the shore of the lake mr @entity79 said he had not seen any other gulls in the park eating the pigeons			1
' normally when a gull has a successful feeding strategy , other gulls copy it - this is why so many gulls snatch ice cream at the beach , ' he said			2
' no other gull has managed to copy it here , at least not so far - the others probably are n’t powerful enough			0
' the gull is male and has a mate , who is smaller - male gulls are slightly larger than females			2
she does n’t take part in the killing , but comes in afterwards and they share the pigeon			0
' scene : the @entity2 in @entity3 , central @entity7 , where the vicious bird has been seen			1
