‘ i hope i ’ll be remembered as one of the doctors			2
i have no ill feeling towards the character or the series			1
’ he has previously hinted about a row with the show ’s bosses , saying of his tenure in the role : ‘ i did n’t agree with the way things were being run , or like the culture that grew up around the series			1
