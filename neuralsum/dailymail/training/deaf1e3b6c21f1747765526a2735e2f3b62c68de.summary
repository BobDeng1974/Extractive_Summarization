by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 10:22 est , 10 august 2012 updated : 11:26 est , 10 august 2012 @entity1 said he and @entity2 are not friends as the @entity4 went to war again over plans to redraw constituency boundaries			1
the prime minister insisted the coalition will last until 2015 despite the most heated disagreement of the government so far in recent weeks over @entity13 reform			2
but he made clear that the days of a chummy alliance with mr @entity2 - exemplified by their appearance at the @entity17 rose garden in 2010 - are a thing of the past			2
the @entity4 leader has ordered his party to select their parliamentary candidates using the old boundaries			2
mr @entity2 vowed to block the boundary review after @entity29 @entity38 refused to support his plans to reform the @entity13			1
but the move dashes hopes in @entity29 high command that the @entity4 might change their mine before the vote due next year			2
@entity46 atmosphere : the prime minister made the revelations about the end of his closeness to mr @entity2 on @entity52 's @entity51 this morning it means @entity54 and the @entity4 will be able to select candidates who can campaign for three years in the correct wards , while @entity29 will have to stick to the pretence that the boundaries might change unless mr @entity1 throws in the towel			1
the spat has strained coalition relations			0
mr @entity1 joked he and mr @entity2 should play volleyball to boost their team work and partnership but he told @entity66 's @entity51 he and the deputy prime minister were not close enough to eat together			1
' it 's not friends as in we go out for happy meals together , ' he said			0
not on the menu : mr @entity1 said he and mr @entity2 do not go out for ' happy meals ' together however , the prime minister insisted that the government would still last until 2015			1
he said : ' this coalition will go all the way , there is a lot more for us to do			0
' you will see us this autumn coming out of the starting blocks - maybe not quite as fast as @entity82 - with a really packed programme of what we want to do for this country			0
' @entity4 plans to finish off the boundary review were revealed in an email sent to party members in the @entity90 region which reveals that mr @entity2 has decreed that all selections of prospective parliamentary candidates for 2015 will be based on 2010 general election boundaries			1
' the @entity4 in @entity23 will be opposing any proposed boundary changes for the 2015 general election , as a direct response to the conservative backbench opposition to @entity98 , ' the email reads			0
' it is therefore very unlikely that the planned boundary changes will be able to go ahead for this electoral cycle			0
