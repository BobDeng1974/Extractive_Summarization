forget the idea @entity0 simply picked any old cave to sleep in for the night			1
researchers have discovered an elaborate 44,000 - year - old @entity0 house in @entity5 , eastern @entity6 , made from mammoth bones , delicately decorated with carvings and pigments			1
it had been thought @entity0 , which died out around 30,000 years ago , were primitive nomads who lived in caves simply for shelter			1
caveman : although we traditionally think the @entity0 as less than homey , new research shows they did settle down in places , even building homes the latest discovery is believed to be the earliest example of a domestic house built from bone and suggests our ancestors were more homey than previously thought			1
researchers from the @entity26 in @entity27 said it suggests the early human ancestors settled in areas where they built structures to live for extended periods of time			0
@entity34 , an archaeologist who led the research , told @entity36 : ' this mammoth bone structure could be described as the basement of a wooden cover or as a windscreen			0
new research : usually @entity0 are associated with caves , like @entity43 's @entity42 ( pictured ) where a jaw bone was discovered ' the use of bones as building elements can be appreciated as anticipation of climatic variations			1
under a cold climate in an open environment , the lack of wood led humans to use bones to build protections against the wind			0
' the circular house was made up of 116 large bones including mammoth skulls , jaws , 14 tusks and leg bones			0
home is where the heart is : it seems like the @entity0 , pictured here in the @entity68 in @entity69 by @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , did like to settle down occasionally and inside at least 25 hearths filled with ash were also found , suggesting it had been used for some time			1
it is believed the @entity0 hunted and killed the mammoths for meat before using their bones but also collected some of the bones from animals that had died of natural causes			2
@entity84 , a senior lecturer in biological anthropology who researches @entity0 at @entity87 , told @entity36 ' it 's another piece in the newly emerging @entity0 jigsaw puzzle			2
' far from being the stupid cavemen of popular image it 's becoming increasingly clear the @entity0 were a highly sophisticated species of human			2
all the research will be published in scientific journal @entity96			0
it adds to the growing view that neanderthals sophisticated humans who has their own culture and may have even used language to communicate .			0

oldest example of domestic ' house ' built from bone
44,000 year old house had 25 hearths
proves @entity0 were not primitive nomads
neanderthals could anticipate *changing* *seasons*
