by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 20:33 est , 31 january 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 at @entity3 , was behind the tweets its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping			1
and yesterday the internet caused further problems for struggling @entity3 – when staff hijacked the firm ’s @entity11 account to post a blow - by - blow account of mass sackings at head office			1
angry staff gave live updates of the ‘ mass execution ’ at the beleaguered music firm ’s @entity20 headquarters			1
around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired			0
the incident triggered panic among @entity3 executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @ hmvtweets feed			1
the first read : ‘ we ’re tweeting live from inside hr where we ’re all being fired ! @entity36 ! ! ’ one minute later came the update : ‘ there are over 60 of us being fired at once ! @entity40 execution of loyal employees who love the brand			1
’ another followed : ‘ @entity44 overheard our marketing director ( he ’s staying folks ) ask “ how do i shut down twitter ? ”			2
’ one message , spread over two posts , read : ‘ under usual circumstances , we ’d never dare do such a thing as this			0
however , when the company you dearly love is being ruined and those hard working individuals , who wanted to make @entity3 great again , have mostly been fired , there seemed no other choice			1
’ the company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon , however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times			0
' execution ' : the tweets from @entity3 's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting @entity68 , who described herself as @entity3 ’s social media planner , said last night she was behind the tweets			1
the 21 - year - old said senior managers ‘ never seemed to grasp ’ the importance of social media			0
‘ i hope they ’re finally listening , ’ she said in a message from her personal account			2
‘ since my internship started , i worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance of social media – not as a short - term commercial tool , but as a tool to build and strengthen the customer relationship , and to gain invaluable real - time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over 91 years			0
’ final stand : the rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being ' ruined ' so they had no other choice @entity3 later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later , saying there have been job losses but ' not in our stores ' cuts : administrators @entity99 said today that they hoped the brand had a future as a ' restructured business ' just looking : supportive @entity11 users praised the courage of the rogue member of staff it was not known last night if she was one of those being sacked			1
staff at @entity3 , which employs more than 4,000 people , have been afraid for their future since the chain went into administration two weeks ago			1
@entity3 announced the job cuts that sparked the @entity11 revolution this afternoon			2
the anonymous user posting messages from the company 's official account claimed to be at an @entity124 meeting in which 60 members of staff were being let go			1
staff were today made redundant at the following locations : there are hopes that many of the 239 shops and their staff can be saved through a sale of the business to @entity135 , which specialises in rescuing failed brands			2
@entity135 has already purchased @entity3 ’s bank debts , while it is now negotiating to take over the stores			2
its efforts are understood to have the support of a group of music labels and film studios , including @entity144 and @entity145			0
the industry believes it is vital to keep a national chain of entertainment shops on the @entity150 to provide competition to web retailers , such as @entity153 , and the big supermarkets			0
