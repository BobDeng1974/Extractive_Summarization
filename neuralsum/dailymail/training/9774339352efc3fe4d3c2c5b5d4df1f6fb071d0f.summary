the vast majority of the 6.4 million @entity1 enrolled in @entity3 coverage for 2015 through @entity4 never clicked a mouse or made a phone call this year : they were re-enrolled on autopilot			1
only 1.9 million signed up on their own , @entity10 secretary @entity9 said tuesday			1
yet even with this help in capturing customers – including reluctant ones – the @entity17 administration is far behind what @entity19 ' independent bean - counters estimated it would need in order to keep the @entity3 financially afloat			0
@entity21 @entity9 spoke at @entity22 in @entity23 , shown in a file photo			0
@entity3 signup numbers she revealed tuesday are below @entity27 projections shorter @entity3 lines this year : fewer @entity1 are signing up for the first time – an expected development – and most of the renewals are being processed without @entity1 ' explicit say - son the nonpartisan @entity27 ( @entity27 ) projected the overall number , including people who sign up through state - level marketplaces , at 13 million by the end of the open enrollment period ending february 15			1
big states like @entity40 and @entity41 could boost the total , but a @entity44 analysis based on population figures indicates that the nationwide total at year 's end will be less than 8.3 million			1
@entity41 , for instance , had enrolled fewer than 84,000 new customers as of dec. 20			0
the administration will release a full 50 - state report next week , @entity9 said			0
' we still have a lot of work to do , ' she told reporters			0
' but this is an encouraging start			0
' another @entity10 official in november told @entity58 , an inside - the - beltway newspaper , that the agency 's numbers will catch up eventually , but at a slower pace than @entity19 expected			2
' we think the evidence points to a longer ramp - up rate than the @entity27 projections had , and that is based on what we 've learned over the last year from looking at our own data , ' the source said then			2
but the longer - term outlook could get worse before it gets better : @entity27 's numbers call for 25 million enrollees by 2018 , a number that @entity10 has n't said how it can hit			1
worse , @entity27 says that by then 12 million @entity1 will have lost their pre-obamacare medical insurance plans because of the law 's strict minimum standards that have made countless policies illegal			1
the administration also faces trouble as costs increase for consumers			0
an @entity10 official told @entity44 that the agency is bracing for a wave of cancellations in january when many of those who are auto - enrolled see the price tags on their 2015 insurance policies			2
the federal government has anticipated this for months but is powerless to change the situation until at least 2016			0
that 's when , @entity10 hopes , a new rule will go into effect allowing states with their own insurance exchanges to unilaterally change people 's coverage levels in order to prevent a mass ' rate shock ' that could send @entity1 streaming toward @entity3 's exits in favor of paying comparatively modest fines			1
the @entity17 administration 's @entity107 ( @entity107 ) wants to have that level of control for itself a year later			2
' we are considering alternative options for re-enrollment , under which consumers who take no action might be defaulted into a lower cost plan rather than their current plan , ' a november @entity107 fact sheet on the rule changes reads			2
' we are considering allowing states to pursue these sorts of re-enrollment alternatives for coverage in 2016			0
the [ federal government 's marketplace ] is exploring such an approach for coverage in 2017			2
' silver lining : few websitge snafus have marred this year 's @entity3 implementation , but with a user base far smaller than the 2013 audience , @entity10 's web servers have fewer numbers to crunch another problem , warns @entity135 , director of the consulting firm @entity136 , is that the government is n't equipped to re-estimate insurance subsidy levels as quickly as rates go up			1
' those receiving federal premium subsidies may need to switch plans in 2015 to avoid paying more than the limits established by the [ @entity3 ] , ' she said in june , ' and the impact will be more profound for lower - income consumers			0
' meanwhile , @entity10 has revised its enrollment estimates downward			0
the agency 's expectations , lowered in november , now call for only between 9 million and 9.9 million signups for coverage through the end of 2015			1
at current rates the total will likely crest 9.2 million by the mid-february deadline , but is unlikely to approach @entity27 's magic number of 13 million			1
that target is important because when the office ' scored ' the @entity3 in 2009 it laid out targets that were calculated to keep enough money in the system to prevent financial shortfalls that would likely be offset by new tax increases or syrocketing premiums that @entity1 ca n't afford			0
@entity136 projects that the administration will fall short , with no more than 10.5 million customers next year , according @entity166 .			1

just 1.9 million have signed up this year so far
most renewals are on autopilot , creating the risk of ' rate shock ' when *re-upped* @entity1 get their bills in january
@entity10 's *solution* is a plan that would allow the agency to change consumers ' coverage levels without their *permission*
@entity44 projects that fewer than 8.3 million @entity1 will be signed up by the mid-february deadline
that would miss @entity10 's own 9 million to 9.9 million estimate and fall well short of the @entity27 's 13 million number
