by @entity0 published : 19:04 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 04:47 est , 13 january 2014 epidemic : the report warns half of @entity5 will be obese by 2050 @entity8 warnings that half of @entity5 will be obese by 2050 are an ‘ underestimate ’ , a shock report warns today			1
the obesity epidemic could be far worse than predicted because experts did not factor in how much fatter we are getting as we age , it says			0
the report blames junk food firms for confusing the public about healthy eating , and says ministers and gps are failing to get a grip of the problem , with @entity23 systems ‘ not fit for purpose ’			1
more than a quarter of adults ( 26 per cent ) are obese , up from just 8 per cent in 1980			1
in 2007 , an alarming government review warned that by 2050 , obesity would affect half of all adults and cost the economy £ 50billion a year			1
yet a report by the @entity32 says the predictions were ‘ optimistic ’ and underestimated the ‘ true scale of the problem ’			1
the forum – which comprises doctors and other experts – says the government is focusing too much on prevention rather than helping those who are obese lose weight			1
it also describes a reward system for @entity19 , which pays them to record whether patients are too fat without having to offer any dietary advice , as being ‘ unfit for purpose ’			1
dr @entity47 , a cardiologist at @entity48 , @entity49 , said obesity was ‘ the greatest threat to health worldwide ’			0
he said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical inactivity , smoking and alcohol combined , and accused junk food firms of adopting strategies of ‘ denial ’ and trying to confuse the public to ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products			0
dr @entity47 said the companies were using the same tactics as those used by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that smoking caused lung cancer			0
‘ junk food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary drinks , with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of society , including children , ’ he said			0
professor @entity80 , chairman of the forum , said that if anything , levels of obesity had worsened since the 2007 report which influenced several government policies			2
there needs to be concerted action			0
we ’ve seen hard - hitting campaigns against smoking and it ’s time to back up the work that ’s already being done with a similar approach for obesity			0
’ the government has come under fire for failing to tackle obesity and campaigners including tv chef @entity110 have condemned its plans as ‘ inadequate ’ and ‘ a cop - out ’			1
there is also widespread scepticism about its flagship ‘ responsibility deal ’ policy whereby food and drinks firms promise to make products healthier without facing any penalties if they do n’t			0
campaigners have accused ministers of ‘ cosying up ’ to the manufacturers and putting ‘ @entity125 in charge of the blood bank ’ by allowing them to set their own rules			0
criticised : the @entity32 have claimed the @entity23 system in place to deal with the problem is not fit for service today ’s report also criticises the government ’s @entity134 drive – which uses adverts to encourage the public to eat healthily and take exercise for not having enough of an impact			1
the initiative has cost the taxpayer £ 75million since it was launched in january 2009 but the report says a harder - hitting campaign is needed			2
it also urges @entity19 to regularly offer dieting and exercise advice for obese patients whenever they come in for appointments			2
doctors should n’t worry about insulting patients by implying they are ‘ fat ’ , the report states			2
one reason the scale of obesity may have previously been underestimated is that experts had not accounted for the fact that most of us get gradually fatter with age			0
research by @entity161 in november showed that 85 per cent of men and 77 per cent of women are either obese or overweight when they reach 65			1
scepticism : tv chef @entity110 has condemned the government 's efforts to deal with obesity as ' inadequate ' and ' a cop - out ' a damning report by the @entity170 in october warned that the @entity5 had the worst obesity rates in @entity172 and said the problem was a ‘ ticking time bomb waiting to explode ’			1
a @entity176 spokesman said : ‘ @entity177 has one of the highest rates of obesity in the western world and it causes dangerous and life - limiting health conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease			0
‘ but this is not just a matter for government – we look to industry , health professionals and voluntary groups to work jointly to help individuals improve their diet and lifestyles			2
’ professor @entity194 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity177 – the government body tasked with tackling obesity – said : ‘ obesity is an international problem			2
it is a complex issue that requires action at national , local , family and individual level			0

damning publication *suggests* half of @entity5 could be overweight by 2050
@entity32 said gps are failing to get a grip of the problem
says @entity23 system dealing with overweight patients is ' not fit for purpose '
more than a quarter of adults are obese , up from just 8 per cent in 1980
