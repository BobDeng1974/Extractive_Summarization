by @entity0 published : 12:28 est , 16 december 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 17 december 2013 detective constable @entity1 , 46 , is accused of spiking a bottle of energy drink with screenwash and leaving it in a communal fridge at work a child protection detective tried to poison his colleague by switching his @entity11 drink with screenwash after becoming ‘ fed up ’ when his drink kept getting stolen , a court heard today			1
@entity14 @entity1 , 46 , filled the 500ml bottle of sports drink with the potentially deadly blue liquid in a bid to catch the thief and ‘ teach him a lesson ’ , jurors heard			1
detective constable @entity23 experienced a ‘ burning sensation ’ in his mouth and throat and repeatedly vomited after swallowing the noxious substance , @entity22 heard			1
describing the moment he drank the screenwash , @entity28 said : ' i swallowed two @entity32 instantly felt burning in my throat and then i was physically sick into the sink			2
' ' i then went into one of the toilets and i was @entity37 still had the burning in my throat			0
' i obviously was n't aware at the time of what it was i had			0
i was quite anxious and a little bit panicky			0
' he drank milk and brushed his teeth to get rid of the taste and counteract the effects before pouring the rest of the liquid down the sink			2
' i then decanted most of the bottle down the sink , ' he added			2
' it did n't look any different ( to @entity11 )			2
it smelled to me like undiluted screenwash that was quite concentrated			2
' @entity55 insisted he was unaware of any food or drink going missing or any issues between him and other staff			2
' it was a good office ' , he told the jury			0
@entity1 later told an officer investigating the incident that it was his bottle and that he had emptied one of his energy drinks and replaced it with screenwash			1
he told how he was ‘ fed up ’ with his bottles of drink being stolen and that he had ‘ caught the thief ’ , jurors heard			2
the detective said he was ‘ dismayed ’ when two drinks were earlier stolen from a communal fridge and insisted his ‘ sole intention was to catch the thief ' , rather than to cause him or her any harm			0
he claimed he forgot the bottle was in the fridge as he had been busy at work , jurors heard			1
in interview , @entity1 said in a prepared statement : ‘ i admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions			2
@entity1 is said to have tipped screenwash into a @entity11 bottle later drunk by @entity90 , right ‘ i am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened			1
it was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone			0
' mr @entity23 was advised to go to hospital after drinking the screenwash on 29 january last year but escaped serious injury , jurors heard			1
the pair were based at police offices in @entity101 , @entity102 , but did not know each other , said prosecutor @entity104			0
she said : ‘ the allegation in this case is the defendant replaced the blue @entity11 drink in a sports - style drinking bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the office he worked			1
‘ he says his motive in doing so was the belief the drink was his , and that the person who had been stealing his drinks would be taught a lesson			0
‘ in fact , his colleague @entity23 had the misfortune also to be a drinker of @entity11 , and to have stored his own @entity11 drinks in the fridge			1
‘ when he drank from the @entity11 in question , he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before experienced the very unpleasant consequences			1
’ as mr @entity23 poured the liquid away into the sink , he smelt it and recognised it as screenwash			1
the jury at @entity22 , pictured , heard that mr @entity23 went to hospital after drinking the liquid ms @entity104 added : ' subsequent analysis of the blue liquid that was left in the @entity11 bottle from which mr @entity23 drank shows that it contains a number of volatile substances , also detected in a control sample of screenwash from the ( @entity143 ) office , including ethanol and various types of industrial solvents			1
' although no analysis could be carried out for it , most screen washes contain ethylene glycol , also commonly found in antifreeze			0
' @entity152 is toxic if ingested in sufficient quantities			0
' ms @entity104 added : ‘ the prosecution say that whether this drink was in fact @entity55 ’s , or whether he thought it was , or even if he was stealing @entity159 ’s drink is irrelevant			0
‘ this was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances			0
' the defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose ' - prosecutor @entity104 ‘ by deliberately disguising the blue screen wash in a @entity11 bottle and placing it , unlabelled , in the communal fridge , the defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have foreseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose			1
' she added : ‘ at the very least , he must have intended that the person should be annoyed by suffering an unpleasant experience			0
‘ even if he honestly believed that anyone who took his drink was stealing it , to replace that drink with at best an unpleasant substance , at worst , one that had the potential to be dangerous , was not a reasonable thing to do in the circumstances			0
’ while @entity1 was awaiting trial , he contacted the drinks manufacturer , @entity192 , to check where the bottle could be traced to , the prosecutor added			1
@entity1 , from @entity194 , @entity195 , denies a single count of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent			1
the trial , which is expected to last three to four days , continues			0
