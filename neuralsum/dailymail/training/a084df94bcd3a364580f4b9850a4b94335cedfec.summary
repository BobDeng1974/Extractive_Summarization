by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 20:32 est , 22 december 2013 @entity3 : 06:00 est , 23 december 2013 millions of parents whose young children have a child trust fund will be allowed to transfer the money into a @entity9 , the @entity4 can reveal			2
it is a landmark victory for this newspaper ’s @entity12 section which has campaigned for more than two years for the absurd rule , which currently bans the transfer , to be scrapped			0
@entity16 , the chancellor , said the decision ‘ supports hard - working families who want to save for their children			1
’ move : chancellor @entity16 ( pictured with a young girl at a @entity22 tea party in may ) said the decision ' supports hard - working families who want to save for their children ' @entity25 were launched by the @entity27 government more than a decade ago , with an average voucher of £ 250 given to babies born between september 1 , 2002 and 2 january 2011			1
around 6.3million children have a @entity25 with a total of £ 5billion invested in these nest eggs , with extra money contributed by relatives and friends			1
when the @entity36 came to power , they were scrapped and replaced by the @entity38			1
but , to the fury of millions of parents , children with a @entity25 were not allowed to open a @entity42 and were not allowed to move money from a @entity25 into a @entity44 as a result , the money was left locked in @entity25 accounts paying dire rates , while @entity49 were paying far more generous rates			1
the best rate for a @entity38 cash @entity9 is currently six per cent , but the best rate for a child trust fund is half this amount			2
if a parent put £ 300 a month into their child ’s account from birth until his or her 18th birthday , it would total £ 118,800 in the @entity63 but the child with the @entity25 paying a rate of only three per cent would get £ 86,000 despite their parents ’ making exactly the same contribution , a difference of nearly £ 33,000			1
to make matters worse , some @entity25 providers imposed rip - off charges			2
for example , @entity74 ’s oldest investment company , @entity75 , hit its savers with a £ 30 annual fee , which would decimate a £ 250 savings pot in just eight years			1
doing the maths : ctfs were launched by the @entity27 government more than a decade ago , with an average voucher of £ 250 given to babies born between september 1 , 2002 and 2 january 2011 ( file picture ) mr @entity16 told the @entity4 : ‘ this government supports hard - working families who want to save for their children			1
‘ so i ’m delighted that , as a result of these changes , over six million children who currently have savings in a @entity25 will be able to benefit from better returns and lower charges on those savings			2
’ the government hopes to make the transfers legal ‘ as soon as possible ’ , with the change expected to take place in april 2015			0
the move is a relief for families , many of whom worried that the unfair transfer ban was creating an unfair divide between their offspring , where the eldest might have a @entity25 but a younger sibling has a junior isa. ' over six million children who currently have savings in a @entity25 will be able to benefit from better returns and lower charges on those savings ' chancellor @entity16 for the last two years , the @entity111 has insisted there is no difference between the two types of accounts			1
but the announcement , which is expected today , endorses the @entity4 ’s campaign , which has been supported by major banks , investment firms and financial advisers			0
parents were penalised , not just by lower rates and rip - off charges on child trust funds , but also a chronic lack of choice			2
a dwindling number of banks and building societies offer @entity25 , while @entity42 savers can choose from a huge number of options			1
around £ 550million is currently held in @entity133 by around 300,000 children			0
when they reach 18 , @entity42 savers can move their money directly into a tax - efficient adult @entity9 , but a quirk in the legislation meant that those with @entity25 were only able to move their money into taxable accounts			1
parents were not given a £ 250 voucher to put into their child ’s @entity42 , but they can invest up to £ 3,720 every tax year into their child ’s nest egg			1
the same amount can also be invested into a @entity25 every year			0
saving up : @entity148 and @entity149 with @entity150 ( left ) and @entity151 @entity148 and @entity149 are relieved they will now be able to treat their children in the same way			0
the couple have two boys			0
the eldest , @entity151 , who is three , has a @entity25 , but the younger , @entity150 , who is one , has a @entity44 both are held with the @entity160 , but they pay different rates			2
mrs @entity162 , 32 , who works as a team manager for co-op supermarkets , said the administration of two different accounts has been annoying			0
the fact that one of her sons gets a better deal than her other child is also something that bothers her because it seems unfair			0
@entity151 ’s account pays 2.65 per cent , but this is trumped by his younger brother , who gets 3.02 per cent			0
if the children are given money at @entity180 or for their birthdays , it is put into the accounts to give them a helping hand when they reach 18			2
mrs @entity162 , from @entity184 , @entity185 , said : ‘ we are delighted that @entity151 can switch			0
he will earn a better rate and he will avoid having his money taxed when he reaches 18			0
‘ it will also be much easier for us to keep track of just one account			0

he says it ' supports hard - working families who want to save for children '
ctfs were launched by the @entity27 government more than a decade ago
