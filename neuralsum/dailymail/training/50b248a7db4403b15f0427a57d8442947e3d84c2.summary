by @entity0 published : 17:21 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 22:45 est , 26 may 2013 the wedding party was almost ready to set off			1
i took a deep breath , smoothed my ivory lace gown one last time and glanced around me			2
my bridegroom @entity5 looked handsome and dashing in his morning suit , his lilac cravat toning beautifully with the flowers in my bouquet			1
our little boy @entity11 , then 11 months old , toddled behind me , so cute in his tiny suit he was almost edible — a perfect miniature of his father in every way			1
overprotective : first - time mum @entity0 was so worried that her toddler @entity11 would hurt himself that she bought him a crash helmet , and even dressed the tot in the safety gear for her wedding every way , but one			1
on my son ’s head sat an ugly brown helmet , fastened tightly under his chin , and @entity5 had just spotted it			1
‘ oh no , @entity0 — not today , ’ he sighed , rolling his eyes			1
‘ what about the photos ? the guests will think we ’re mad ! ’ ‘ the town hall is huge , ’ i protested , ‘ and it ’s full of sharp edges and polished floors			1
what if he hits his head ? ’ eventually , as my chief bridesmaid muttered about the time , a compromise was negotiated			2
i would agree to remove the helmet if @entity11 could remain strapped into his buggy throughout the ceremony			1
but at the hotel , where the reception was taking place , it would go back on — and stay on			2
safety fears : @entity0 bought @entity11 the helmet when he was around nine - months - old it ’s not as if @entity11 was n’t used to it			1
he was n’t even a year old , yet he had become accustomed to living in an environment created for him by the world ’s most over-protective mother			1
looking back , i was always rather anxious , but that ’s normal for first - time mums			1
it was n’t until @entity11 became mobile that my parental paranoia really kicked in			1
he crawled quite early ; he was barely seven months old			2
but the sight of my baby gleefully propelling himself across the floor of our front room made me feel quite ill. my heart hammered in my chest			2
beads of cold sweat prickled the back of my neck			2
i knew straight away that it was a strange reaction , so i took deep breaths and told myself that learning to crawl was a perfectly normal development ; something to be celebrated — another milestone passed in a child ’s necessary exploration of the world around him			0
so why , when other mothers might reach for their cameras , was i fighting the temptation to confine my boy in a playpen or a buggy ? why , when most women would actively encourage their infants , did i long to hold my child back ? i suspect the answers to those questions can be found in events that took place long before my son was even born			2
@entity11 was the happy result of my third pregnancy			1
before he arrived to make our dreams come true , i suffered two miscarriages			0
i lost my first baby at nine weeks and the second one at six weeks			2
and all the time i was expecting @entity11 , i continued to show symptoms that indicated i might miscarry again			1
so that whole pregnancy was spent in fear			0
from the very day i discovered i was having @entity11 , i became convinced i was about to lose him , too			1
that he was eventually born safely was as much a surprise to me as a joy			0
when i finally accepted he was here — alive and healthy — the fear that he would share the fate of my first two babies was replaced by another fear			0
suddenly , the world around me seemed unsafe			0
secret purchase : @entity0 bought the helmet from an online seller , without telling her husband @entity5 , who joked that their son was about to start performing stunts while he was tiny , i convinced myself that i could keep any threat to my precious child at bay with ceaseless vigilance			1
but as @entity11 grew and wanted to explore , our whole world , even our home , turned into a place full of dangers			1
it was all i could see			0
the edges of tables and drawers looked as sharp as blades			1
@entity137 , out - of - reach blind cords , belts and bits of string were now strangulation hazards			0
anything smaller than a tennis ball was a potential choking hazard			0
and heaven help any innocent men who smiled at my son in his pram			2
potential child abductors , all of them			0
when @entity11 started pulling himself upright , i began sticking big blobs of @entity150 on every sharp corner in our home in case his precious head should make contact with them			1
no table , dining chair or chest of drawers was safe from my paranoid attention			0
i bought extra pillows and cushions , dozens of them , and placed them everywhere — against doors , skirting boards and cupboards			1
our front room looked like the inside of a bedouin tent , but still i could n’t relax			0
so i went online and researched safety equipment			2
when @entity11 was about nine months old i found a company which produced helmets for babies and toddlers , so i ordered one , without telling @entity178			1
‘ what the blazes is that ? ’ he asked the first time he saw his son in it			2
‘ it ’s a crash hat , ’ i said sheepishly			2
seeing sense : @entity0 soon realised that her little boy was itching to explore , without his protective headgear , and @entity5 made her bin the helmet ‘ for what , ’ he demanded			1
‘ @entity11 going to start motorcycle stunts ? ’ but i could n’t be persuaded — or teased — into backing down			1
i thought the helmet was wonderful			2
i could cook , work , or do housework knowing @entity11 was safe			1
and i tried not to notice him tugging in irritation at the strap under his chin			0
i made my toddler wear it all the time at home , and obviously there was no way he would be allowed out of it at our wedding reception			2
and so , after we ’d said our vows and moved on to the hotel , i buckled the helmet on to @entity11 ’s head			1
every so often i ’d notice friends throwing him puzzled looks			0
‘ does he really need that , @entity0 ? ’ one asked			1
‘ of course ! ’ i hissed , almost offended			0
‘ there ’s a massive glass vase over there			0
and look at the sharp corners on those shelves ! ’ adventurous : nearly four years on from his helmet - wearing days , @entity11 has grown into a fearless little boy a few days later , when we posted our wedding photos online , questions began to flood in from friends who had n’t been there			1
‘ i saw @entity11 wearing a helmet — is everything all right , ’ asked one			1
‘ has he got a head injury ? ’ then another , an old childhood friend , asked more bluntly : ‘ why is that poor boy wearing that ridiculous hat ? ’ i offered my usual explanation ; that the world was a far too dangerous place to unleash a wobbly - legged toddler			0
‘ you ca n’t be serious , ’ she told me			0
‘ have you forgotten what a daredevil you used to be ? ’ her words stung			0
they brought back my own carefree childhood in the @entity246 — the long summer holidays when my friends and i were allowed to play outside until all hours , revelling in our independence , never giving a thought to the bruises , bumps and splinters picked up along the way			0
i would roller - skate downhill at breakneck speed and on a bike i was a total menace			0
i once went so fast that when i slammed on the brakes i catapulted myself head - first over a neighbour ’s parked car			0
i was none the worse for any of it , although i ca n’t speak for the car			0
in fact , the freedom my parents gave me taught me to be self - reliant , not to whine about minor injuries and to puzzle out my problems for myself			2
i gazed at my son sitting on the floor in the safety of his own home , wearing a crash hat , surrounded by cushions			1
his little face was full of the excitement and curiosity of a child aching to explore the world , and it broke my heart			0
was i protecting him — or smothering him ? my friends were right			0
perhaps i needed to let go a little			0
with great reluctance , i put the helmet in the wardrobe			2
@entity178 raised an exasperated eyebrow and pointed to the bin			0
so i threw it away			0
then i picked off every piece of sticky @entity150 from the furniture and offered up a silent prayer that @entity11 would n’t knock himself out			1
over the next few months , @entity11 fell over countless times			1
on one occasion he fell on to the corner of my laptop and i rushed him to @entity298			0
he did n’t even have a bruise			0
happy families : @entity0 says she has realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting your child , but equipping them to survive in the world , sharp corners and all the doctors told me that babies were resilient and to go home			1
they were right : he was fine			0
as he grew , i lost count of the times he fell and cried ; the times i had to put ‘ magic cream ’ on his bloodied knees			0
but as my husband says : ‘ this is what little boys do			2
’ nearly four years on , @entity11 has grown into a typically fearless little boy			1
he whizzes around on his bike like a miniature @entity324 , loves climbing trees and always seems to have rips in his trousers and scabs on his knees			0
while i still feel that flutter of fear in my stomach when i see him career off on his bike , i tell myself it is normal ; that i have to watch quietly from the sidelines , and that those minor injuries are just little markers of lessons learned on his journey to adulthood			0
i finally realised that being a good mother is not only about protecting your child , but equipping them to survive in the world — sharp corners and all .			1
