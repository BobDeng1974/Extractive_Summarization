by @entity0 published : 00:56 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 06:33 est , 27 november 2013 the popularity of programmes such as @entity3 and @entity4 may be soaring but many brits watch top cooks at work while eating a bowl of cereal or beans on toast for dinner , according to a survey			1
while we may admire the work of @entity17 and @entity18 , their shows do n't seem to inspire viewers to cook			1
a study of 1,000 adults in the @entity22 found that cooking programmes rank among our favourite to watch , but one in four people still eat cereal for their dinner at least once a week			1
interest : shows such as @entity3 , above , have soared in popularity but many home cooks do not take inspiration from @entity17 , centre more than a third of adults now describe themselves as a ‘ foodie ’ , but despite that claim , almost half have just a handful of meals that they cook during the working week			1
many regularly resorting to basic pasta for their dinner			1
the survey , conducted by frozen fod company @entity43 , found that @entity5 watch an average of 121 hours of food programmes on tv every year and own an average of nine recipe books			1
however , despite this interest in all things to do with food , 33 per cent of those polled admitted to eating the same dinner at least twice a week half said they only have a handful of ‘ go - to ’ meals that they cook week after week			1
researchers found 36 per cent of respondents now consider themselves a ' foodie '			0
not time to bake : respondents in the survey said they simply had no time to follow complex recipes , the likes of which are shown by @entity18 onthe @entity4 but 40 per cent of @entity5 are still too tired to think about cooking a proper meal at the end of the day			2
according to the findings , the average @entity68 has a repertoire of six midweek meals			0
the study identified these as dishes they prepare and serve in less than 30 minutes			0
pasta was the most popular ' go - to ' dinner , followed by a jacket potato , stir - fry and beans on toast			2
the glamorous dishes which are shown on screens may have inspired culinary ambition , with half saying they wished they could serve up more exciting meals for their family			0
but , when asked what was the reason behind their lack of adventure in the kitchen , long working hours and never having the right ingredients to hand were popular responses			0
@entity97 , general marketing manager at @entity98 , said : ' foodie programmes and celebrity cook books are a national obsession , but many of us simply do n’t have the time to try our hand at recreating delicious meals for ourselves at the end of a long working day			2
' as our lives are becoming increasingly busy and time is such a precious commodity , it is clear to see from the research that we ’re reaching for products we can trust to create great tasting enjoyable nutritious meals quickly and easily			0
' it ’s all too easy to get stuck in a recipe rut and find yourself eating the same meal several times in a fortnight simply out of a sense of routine			0
' staple : beans on toast remains a favourite of those who have a limited repertoire of home - cooked meals			0
