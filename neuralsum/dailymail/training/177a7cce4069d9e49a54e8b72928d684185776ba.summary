@entity1 had an oxygen - rich atmosphere more than a billion years before the @entity4 , scientists believe			1
an examination of meteorites and rocks on the planet suggests that oxygen was affecting the @entity1 surface four billion years ago			1
on @entity4 , oxygen did not build up to appreciable quantities in the atmosphere for at least another 1,500 million years			1
by using the @entity15 to examine the meteorites and rocks on @entity1 ' surface , scientists were able to determine that oxygen was affecting the @entity1 surface four billion years ago , one billion years before @entity4 scientists compared @entity1 meteorites that have crashed onto the @entity4 and data from rocks examined by the @entity25 space agency @entity24 's @entity15			1
differences in their composition can best be explained by an abundance of oxygen early in @entity1 history			2
@entity15 was exploring a very ancient part of @entity1 containing rocks more than 3,700 million years old			1
the rocks bear the hallmarks of early exposure to oxygen before being ' recycled ' - drawn into shallow regions of the planet 's interior and then spewed out in volcanic eruptions			1
volcanic @entity1 meteorites , on the other hand , originate from deeper within the planet where they would be less affected by oxygen			1
martian meteorites travel to @entity4 after being flung into space by massive eruptions or impacts			0
scientists compared @entity1 meteorites that have crashed onto the @entity4 and data from rocks on @entity1 the new research , published in the journal nature , has implications for the possibility of past life on @entity1			1
on early @entity4 , the atmosphere was gradually filled with free oxygen by photosynthesising microbes			2
scientists call this the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			0
the link between oxygen and life on @entity1 is less certain			2
@entity66 could have been produced biologically , or by a chemical reaction in the atmosphere			0
lead scientist professor @entity69 , from @entity70 , said : ' the implication is that @entity1 had an oxygen - rich atmosphere at a time , about 4,000 million years ago , well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen on @entity4 around 2,500 million years ago			1
' as oxidation is what gives @entity1 its distinctive colour , it is likely that the ' red planet ' was wet , warm and rusty billions of years before @entity4 's atmosphere became oxygen rich			1
' in may , scientists revealed that they had recently discovered pebbles on @entity1 , showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - and giving more weight to the theory that it was once able to support life			1
on early @entity4 , the atmosphere was gradually filled with free oxygen by photosynthesising microbes in a process called the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			2
the rounded pebbles were found by the team from @entity24 's curiosity rover mission and published in journal @entity98			2
pebbles are only formed when they are carried through water over long distances , according to researchers			0
it is the first time that evidence of sustained water flows on @entity1 has been uncovered			0
the discovery of pebbles came just before an announcement eight days ago that powerful evidence that water good enough to drink had been found by @entity110 , one of @entity24 ’s aging rover vehicles			0
evidence of water of @entity1 has been indicated by a succession of discoveries on @entity1 but until now they have all suggested flows of sulphuric acid			0
this is the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable			0
the discovery boosts the chances that one of life ’s most important building blocks was once present on the planet , and might even still be there			0
launched : 7 july 2003landed on @entity1 : 25 january 2004planned mission length : 90 @entity131 mission length : nine years and @entity132 : @entity134 has it found ? the first evidence of drinkable or neutral water was discovered on @entity137 in june 2013			0
previous assumptions had been that all liquid on @entity1 was sulphuric acid			0
the presence of water means that @entity1 is capable of supporting some kind of life - form			2
launched : 26 november 2011landed on @entity1 : 6 august 2012planned mission length : two @entity147 mission length : @entity148 : @entity134 has it found ? @entity150 streamed the first ever live video from the surface of @entity1			0
and in may , @entity153 uncovered pebbles on the planet 's surface , showing for the first time ever that a stream or a sustained water flow inhabited the planet close to two billion years ago			1
as rounded pebbles are only formed after being carried through water over long distances , the evidence of flowing water is indisputable .			0

rocks examined by @entity24 's @entity15 suggest oxygen affected @entity1 ' surface four billion years ago , more than a billion years before @entity4
findings have implications for the possibility of past life on @entity1
' oxidation makes @entity1 the ' red planet ' - it was wet , warm and rusty billions of years before @entity4 's atmosphere became oxygen rich '
