there was a cold expression on @entity3 's face as he stood on the pitch , one hand in pocket , digesting @entity8 's exit from the @entity9			1
there was an air of disbelief that somehow his plans had not come off and @entity14 really had just beaten them on penalties to reach the @entity9 final			1
but he will not have long to mourn , a new challenge is afoot at @entity19 and we have already been given a sneak preview of what @entity23 football can expect next season			1
this is no ordinary manager			2
this was epitomised in his substitution of @entity40 in their last 16 match against @entity43			2
@entity8 were a goal down with 15 minutes to play			2
the last person anyone expected to be taken off – particularly the @entity31 fans – was the star striker and captain			2
partnership : @entity3 ( left ) and his star striker @entity40 after the shootout defeat against @entity14 super sub : @entity50 celebrates his winning penalty against @entity43 in the last 16 @entity3 did n't even flinch as he primed @entity50 and hooked @entity40			1
he did n't even waver when considering that if @entity40 had lost the plot , this was also one of the key players he would be managing at @entity19 next season			1
the @entity31 players began firing balls up to @entity50 on @entity3 's orders			1
in the final two minutes they turned the game on its head			2
@entity50 won the knock - down header from a corner to set up @entity64 's 88th - minute equaliser then confidently converted the match - winning penalty , won by @entity67 , in stoppage time			1
weaknesses very few weaknesses can be ascribed to the man , and perhaps no major ones			0
his age , 62 , could perhaps be considered one for @entity19 fans			1
even if he tears through the @entity76 in a whirlpool of success , he will never be able to provide the longevity of sir @entity80			2
listen up : @entity3 gives animated instructions to full - back @entity82 during the @entity14 clash it is also worth noting that despite the winning aura surrounding the @entity31 he has won just two league titles and one @entity88 in the past 15 years and in spells at two other @entity91 heavyweights – one at @entity93 and two at @entity95 – he failed to shine			1
touch of genius in living rooms , pubs , bars , beaches with big screens , slums and street parties across the globe , people turned to each other in bewilderment when @entity3 substituted goalkeeper @entity108 for @entity109 in extra-time stoppage time of their quarter - final match against @entity112			1
@entity109 had not played a single minute of the tournament			2
the game was going into penalties			0
everyone assumed @entity109 had an impeccable penalty record			1
in fact , he 'd saved just two of his previous 20			0
sports psychologist @entity120 explained : ' @entity3 making such a surprising change just before such a high - stress event would have made it much worse for the @entity124			1
they would have something else to think about			0
it would play on their minds			0
' it got to the the @entity124 and @entity109 saved two to send his side through			1
@entity109 blow : @entity3 sent on @entity134 's goalkeeper to break @entity112 hearts in the quarter - final shootout @entity138 boy : @entity3 embraces @entity109 after his substitution proved to be a masterstroke @entity141 is penalty hero tactics in this @entity9 @entity8 have played 5 - 3 - 2 , 4 - 3 - 3 , 3 - 4 - 3 , 5 - 2 - 3 ( at times almost a 7 - 3 - 0 ) and against @entity14 on wednesday night in an attempt to deal with @entity145 they switched to 6 - 3 - 1 when they did n't have the ball			1
although they did n't win , that particular tactic worked and @entity145 cut a frustrated figure all night			0
going nowhere : @entity145 ( centre right ) was shackled by @entity153 in the semi-final @entity3 will change tactics at half - time , on the touchline , in his sleep , over dinner , at his kids ' birthdays , or even in the drinks break against @entity43 with just 14 minutes of the match remaining and his side trailing by a single goal			1
that , again , worked when they overturned the deficit			0
' it 's all about winning , ' @entity3 said			1
' i want to win			0
i 'm going to pick a system that will help me win			0
' discipline only a leader who can instil strict discipline in his players could get them to function in so many different systems in one tournament			0
sometimes in a single game			0
and @entity3 is famous for his discipline			2
when at @entity93 he insisted that players must eat in the same seat and sit up straight during team meals			0
@entity3 's the man : the @entity31 players listen intently as their boss delivers a stern team - talk in @entity186 one afternoon at lunch , he noticed @entity188 was slouched over his plate			1
when @entity188 ignored his shouts across the canteen , @entity3 strode over , pulled the 6ft 3ins @entity188 up by his collar and forced him up - right			1
from then on , everyone sat up at meals			0
@entity188 left the club within a year			0
his discipline also extends back home			0
in @entity31 there is an informal and formal version of the word ' you			0
' @entity3 makes his two daughters , @entity204 and @entity205 , use the formal version when they speak to him			2
personality @entity208 played for @entity3 in the glorious @entity210 team of the mid- 1990s which won three league titles , the @entity212 and @entity213			1
' @entity3 has a strong , explosive personality that brings some extra stuff sometimes but his track record speaks for itself , ' @entity208 said during this tournament			1
it will be interesting to see what is hidden behind this ' extra stuff ' but there is no doubt that @entity3 will enter @entity223 in a shower of fireworks			1
the @entity226 should brace themselves			0
in four weeks of this @entity9 he has absolutely laid into @entity227			2
just look at his face : the pair celebrate @entity40 's stunning header against @entity231 in the group stage about the unfair fixture list favouring @entity234			1
' @entity227 plays these tricks , ' he said			0
about the fact he had ' no view ' from his dugout at @entity240 in @entity241 when they played @entity243			0
about the third and fourth place play - off , blasting @entity227 after their defeat to @entity14			2
' this game has nothing to do with sports in my opinion , ' he raged			0
' there is only one prize and one award that counts for anything and that is becoming champion			0
' in fact , everyone should brace themselves : @entity23 football is in for a treat .			0

@entity3 is set to take over as @entity19 's new manager
@entity3 's @entity8 side lost against @entity14 after penalty shootout in @entity9 semi-final

*decisions* over @entity40 , @entity50 - @entity50 , @entity109 and @entity153 display @entity3 's *mangerial* personality
