by @entity0 prime minister @entity1 pledged to bring in tough new curbs on strikes in ' essential ' services if the tories win the next election the @entity7 will bring in tough new curbs on strikes in ‘ essential ’ services if they win the next election , @entity1 pledged yesterday			2
the prime minister said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on industrial action before it can trigger a strike			1
he said he had been held back from introducing a threshold of this type since he took office in 2010 because of opposition from @entity19 in the @entity20			1
mr @entity1 told @entity21 : ‘ of course there is a right to strike in our country			2
but in essential services , is n’t it worth saying that there ought to be a threshold , a certain percentage of people who have to take part before a strike is called that does so much damage ? ’ ‘ this is not something i can deliver in @entity20			2
our @entity19 coalition partners do n’t seem keen on this , for whatever reason			2
but i am keen on it , and a new conservative @entity20 would deal with that			0
’ he did not outline which types of industrial action could come under the remit of the new rules			0
a @entity49 source said no decisions had yet been taken , and it was not known at what level the turnout threshold would be set			0
but campaigners have called for a minimum threshold to be introduced for the railways , the fire service , the @entity56 and schools			1
however @entity60 , general secretary of the @entity62 union , responded : ‘ if 50 per cent of those eligible to vote becomes the new test of democratic legitimacy , not a single mp including mr @entity1 passes the test			1
‘ few would argue that the outcome of a general election is a lot more important than the result of any strike ballot			0
we can not have abstentions added to no votes to count as a no vote in a strike ballot and totally ignored in the more important ballot vote to elect our @entity80			2
‘ workers ’ rights are already severely constrained and curtailing the right to strike even more is simply neither acceptable nor democratic			0
’ @entity1 , pictured giving a talk in @entity85 , said he intends to introduce a minimum threshold on the number of employees who must take part in a ballot on industrial action before it can trigger a strike speaking at a question and answer session in @entity101 , @entity85 , on thursday , mr @entity1 said : ‘ when strikes take place that are hugely disruptive to other people ’s lives , they should at least have the support of a good share of the members of that trade union			1
‘ i ’m looking at if we can change that for the future , because i think a strike should be the last weapon that people use			0
‘ people should be talking , people should be negotiating			0
in some of these cases people have opted for a strike far too quickly and we need to change that			0
’ @entity121 mayor @entity120 has demanded a threshold to be set so that a strike can not be held unless at least 50 per cent of all eligible union members vote in favour			1
@entity121 mayor @entity120 has demanded a threshold to be set so that a strike can not be held unless at least 50 per cent of all eligible union members vote in favour @entity130 mp @entity129 , who has campaigned for strike thresholds , said : ‘ we need this reform to make sure militant hardliners lacking majority support from rank and file members ca n’t hold the hard - working public to ransom with outlandish demands			1
‘ the public back this proposal by three to one , but yet again the @entity19 have blocked a common - sense measure most would welcome			1
’ the comments come after a disruptive strike on the @entity146 at the end of last month .			0
