by @entity1 reporter published : 03:08 est , 19 october 2012 updated : 04:39 est , 19 october 2012 canned : the @entity2 faces further questions over why a 10 - minute @entity5 film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by @entity8 was dropped last december a leaked email has cast doubt on the @entity2 's reason for cancelling a @entity5 investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse by @entity8			1
the corporation has previously insisted that it decided not to proceed with the @entity5 film for ' editorial reasons ' because the abuse story ' could not be substantiated '			1
but an internal email discussing the investigation into the late @entity21 suggests that the show was scrapped because of concerns it would clash with the tv channel 's planned @entity26 tributes to the star			0
the email dated on december 7 , published by @entity30 today , reveals the investigation into abuse by @entity8 was so well advanced by then that the press office was preparing ' lines to take ' to respond to questions after its planned broadcast			1
the email , sent from a press officer to @entity5 editor @entity39 and other staff , shows that the @entity2 was aware of the risk that the report would raise questions about why it had failed to expose @entity8 as a paedophile while he was alive			1
the press officer wrote that ' we may well need to do a bit of managing around this ' and that ' we should bear in mind how @entity2 complaints team respond '			0
it also contradicts claims by the @entity2 that the film focused on an alleged failure by police to investigate @entity57 properly and that @entity5 journalists were in fact ' focusing on allegations of abuse '			2
@entity39 has previously claimed that the story his journalists had been pursuing had been ' weakened from a @entity5 perspective ' because they had been unable to establish any ' institutional failure ' by the police or the @entity67			0
leaked : this email from publicist @entity69 has cast doubt on the reasons the @entity2 has previously stated for dropping the @entity5 film on @entity73 investigation : @entity75 is now investigating the @entity8 abuse case involving dozens of potential victims @entity78 , the @entity78 mp for @entity79 , who obtained the email , said : ' @entity5 editor @entity39 and the @entity2 have sought to portray that the axed @entity5 report was not an expose of @entity73 , but was focused on the reasons the police and the @entity67 dropped their investigation			1
' this leaked email and the evidence from internal @entity2 sources casts doubt on the carefully crafted version of events posted in @entity39 's blog on october 2			2
' we need a full explanation of why the focus of the @entity5 expose of @entity8 was abruptly changed at the last minute			2
' responding to the leaked email , the @entity2 spokesman said : ' this ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the @entity2 has previously said on this			1
' it is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the @entity5 producer asking for further information about the @entity8 investigation			2
' cover - up ? @entity5 , presented by @entity109 ( above ) , spiked the film despite journalists interviewing 10 alleged victims and witnesses and believing they had enough information to broadcast the story apology : the director - general of the @entity2 @entity118 has previously issued a ' profound and heartfelt apology ' to @entity8 's victims she added that the email would be passed to the inquiry into whether there were any failings in the way the @entity5 report was handled			1
@entity128 executive @entity127 is to lead the @entity2 's independent review into the matter while former high court judge @entity131 will lead a second examination into the ' culture and practices of the @entity2 ' during the years @entity8 worked there			0
on the defence : @entity5 editor @entity39 ( above ) said the current affairs show dropped the story because it ' had not established any institutional failure ' on behalf of the police or @entity67 the disclosures about @entity8 's private life were made in an @entity143 documentary a fortnight ago			2
around 60 people have now come forward to say they were a victim of the veteran dj , tv presenter and charity campaigner			0
police believe the disgraced star , who died a year ago , may have been abusing victims for decades			0
the @entity2 and other bodies could be sued by victims if it can be shown they were negligent in allowing @entity8 to prey on his young victims			0
a @entity155 investigation will also be conducted into @entity8 's conduct during his charity work at three hospitals - @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity163 general @entity161 has called for an independent inquiry as the fall - out from the revelations continues			0
@entity2 director general @entity118 and former corporation stalwart @entity167 have become involved as questions are asked about who knew of the rumours about @entity8 , what and when they heard about them , and whether enough was done to stop him			0
but a spokeswoman for the @entity2 dismissed the email as ' simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the @entity5 producer asking for further information about the @entity8 investigation ' .			1

@entity182 previously said @entity5 film was axed because the abuse story ' could not be substantiated '
a leaked email shows the investigation was far advanced and @entity2 press office was preparing response to questions for after the broadcast
document also shows @entity2 was aware film could raise questions about why it had failed to expose @entity8 as a paedophile while he was alive
