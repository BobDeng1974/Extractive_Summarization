@entity0 as we know it could be getting a revamp			0
@entity3 has launched a new app called @entity5 designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number is n't stored in your contacts book			1
it pulls in any publicly - shared data from a user 's @entity3 profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers			1
it pulls in any publicly - shared data from a user 's @entity3 profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers the free app is currently in testing and is only available on @entity27 devices in the @entity28			1
it is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful			0
' billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who ’s calling them , ' explained @entity3 's product manager @entity38 in a blog post			1
@entity3 has tweaked its @entity41 setting to make posts from friends more prominent			0
the rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends			0
content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up in @entity41 so they are less likely to miss it			0
the latest update will also make posts and @entity54 that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down			0
@entity3 said : ' the goal of @entity41 is to show you the content that matters to you			2
' this means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses			0
' this balance is different for everyone [ and ] as more people and pages are sharing more content , we need to keep improving @entity41 to get this balance right			0
' ' today we are starting to test @entity5 , a new app built by the messenger team			2
' @entity5 connects with @entity3 so you can see who ’s calling , block unwanted calls and search for people and places			1
' when a user receives a call , @entity5 shows them info about who ’s calling , even if they do n’t have that number saved			1
users will only see information that people have already shared on @entity3 , and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app 's downfall			1
callers must also have a @entity3 account in order for the data to be shared but they do n't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call			2
they also do n't need to have @entity5 installed , either			0
another feature of @entity5 includes making it easier to block unwanted calls			2
from the settings menu in @entity5 people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers			1
this is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers , for example , and blocked calls go straight to voicemail			0
when a user receives a call @entity114 shows them info about who ’s calling , even if they do n’t have that number saved ( pictured left )			1
hello also makes it easier to block unwanted calls and see which numbers have been blocked from other users ( pictured right ) in the app 's settings menu the list of blocked calls can also be reviewed in the recent calls list			0
if a call is made and the number is n't linked to a @entity3 account , @entity5 simply shows the number like a traditional caller @entity134			1
however , if other users have blocked this number the number of times it has been blocked is also shown			0
elsewhere , when users search for people and businesses on @entity3 they can call them with one tap when @entity5 is installed			1
and in the case of searching for businesses , @entity5 will also show opening hours and web addresses where possible , on the user 's screen .			2

when a user receives a call , @entity5 will show them info about who ’s calling
this includes any public information *collated* from their @entity3 profile
@entity5 also shows how many people have blocked an *unknown* number
free app is currently in beta and only available on @entity27 devices
