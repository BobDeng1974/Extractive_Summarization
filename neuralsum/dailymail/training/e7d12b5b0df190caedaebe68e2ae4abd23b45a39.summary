' mr @entity60 , 48 , a brewery engineer , said : ' so far we have received bandanas in all of our favourite colours - @entity41 loves wearing them , so she knew he 'd appreciate the gift			2
' she 's also sent a chicken costume for @entity41 which was a funny surprise and completely shows her sense of humour , and also some books			2
' a really special gift was a @entity71 teddy bear which we were going to bury with @entity2 , but after her big brother saw it he wanted to keep it to remind him of her			2
