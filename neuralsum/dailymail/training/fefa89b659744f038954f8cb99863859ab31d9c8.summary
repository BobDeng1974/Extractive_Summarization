lance corporal @entity42 had been captured after a botched retreat which left him seriously wounded by friendly fire			0
despite his comrades ' selfless rescue , his wounds were too severe and he later died			0
however , the bravery of his volunteer rescuers was still commended , as it avoided the need for a ground rescue , which could have led to more casualties			2

' captain @entity7 was sent on his second tour of @entity5 in november 2006 and flew @entity108 with @entity109			1
on january 15 , 2007 , he was tasked with providing air support to around 200 @entity12 in an assault on the @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114			0
in a desperately confusing situation , @entity115 @entity42 was hit by machine gun fire from one of his allies			0

the commandos withdrew but in the confusion left the mortally - wounded @entity132 in the compound and at risk of falling into enemy hands			0
another helicopter spotted the marine ’s body giving off a heat signal which indicated he was still alive			0
the four @entity9 helicopters fired at the @entity11 to keep them away from the stricken marine while a rescue plan was worked out			1
captain @entity7 came up with the suggestion of landing in the compound with two marines strapped to the helicopter , the first time such a mission had ever been carried out			1
after touching down inside the fort the two marines disembarked , leaving @entity152 and the @entity9 exposed to the enemy which bombarded the @entity9 with fire			2
captain @entity7 fired back with his cannon and directed air support cover before the marines returned with @entity115 @entity42 four minutes later			2
it later emerged that the marine received two bullet wounds to the arm and chest from friendly fire and a ricochet shot to the head from a @entity11 bullet			2
it had been suggested captain @entity7 might have faced a @entity169 as the mission had only tentatively been approved by his commanding officer			2
but upon their return to base the @entity12 immediately recommended all the @entity9 pilots for gallantry medals , which saved their careers			0
@entity176 , from @entity177 , said : ' this was the most famous @entity1 helicopter action ever carried out , like something from a @entity181 film			0
' the @entity11 were desperate to capture an @entity9 helicopter and its crew			0
to fly one at 20ft behind enemy lines and land it in the middle of a firefight required the utmost bravery			0
' but the mission was a great morale booster for the troops because it proved that the @entity12 never left any of their men behind			0
' as well as capt @entity7 ’s nine medals , his flying suit worn on the day of the mission is also being sold along with photographs of the @entity9 with the marines sat on the side when it returned to base			2
