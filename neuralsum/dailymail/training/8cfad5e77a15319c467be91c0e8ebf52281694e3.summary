@entity1 's stance on riding the @entity2 could be softening after he initially hinted at a reluctance to ride the race			1
the 2013 winner was absent when the route for next year 's race was announced last month and suggested he may skip the tour to instead target may 's @entity10 and the @entity11 , which begins in august			1
it seems inconceivable that @entity13 would allow its best rider to skip the sport 's most high - profile race next july and one in which @entity1 would be among the favourites , but his comments put his participation in doubt			1
@entity23 cyclist @entity1 's stance on riding the @entity2 could be softening @entity1 abandoned the @entity24 with a broken hand and fractured wrist following three crashes in two days but , in an end of year interview with the @entity13 official website , @entity1 suggested he wanted to lead the @entity9 once more			1
' looking to next year , my key goal is just returning to good condition and being at the front of a race again , ' the 29 - year - old said on @entity37			1
' that 's a really big motivation for me			2
whether it 's the tour or any other race , it 's what i love doing			1
' i love racing and being able to compete at the front - to be with a team of guys who you enjoy being with , and who you work together well with			2
' that 's what gets me through the winter when i 'm riding those long hours on my own			2
' @entity1 abandoned the @entity24 with a broken hand and fractured wrist following three crashes in two days			1
he responded by finishing second in the @entity11 to @entity54			0
after a period of rest and recuperation in which he got married and was able to reflect on 2014 , @entity1 is now keen to resume training for 2015			1
@entity1 celebrates on the podium after winning @entity60 in @entity61 in july 2013 ' i 'm actually really hungry to start training again and keen to get back going , ' added @entity1 , who will once again spend the winter training in @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
' @entity9 was a disappointment but i 've still got a few victories i can be happy about this year			2
' also finishing the @entity11 off in such a decent way , after having all the setbacks - that for me was probably more important than anything else			0
' it means i 'll be able to go forward into next year without starting from a negative position			0
i can go in with a clean slate and give it my best shot			0
' i think the biggest point of the year for me were the first few stages of the @entity9			0
starting up there in @entity80 was something i 'll never forget			0
it was massive and an incredible experience			0
' coming in as the previous winner and having that home support was huge			0
' in terms of performance and satisfaction , i think the @entity11 was definitely the one			0
it left me with the best feeling			0

@entity13 's @entity1 won the @entity93
@entity1 abandoned the @entity24 with a broken hand and fractured wrist
and the 29 - year - old could still race in next year 's tour
