with @entity1 approaching , @entity0 was determined to treat her four closest friends to a top - notch gift			1
so the 38 - year - old was delighted when she spotted scented candles from luxury fragrance brand @entity6 being sold on @entity8 for £ 18 — £ 4 less than their usual retail price			1
' i 'm a great fan of @entity6 products but i have a tight budget , ' says @entity0 , who runs her own company and lives with husband @entity15 , 40 and 15 - month - old @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			1
spot the difference : a real @entity6 candle , left , and a fake , right ' i checked they were being sold by an established seller and scanned the reviews			1
previous customers seemed satisfied so i thought i had found a bargain			0
' but a week later , @entity0 was to discover that the candles she 'd bought were anything but a good deal			1
in fact , they were a potential death trap			0
she had unwittingly fallen for what experts have dubbed the new wave of ' middle - class fakes '			1
these are copycat goods — often priced almost as high as the original , so as not to arouse suspicion — and replicas of everyday brands popular with middle @entity40 , rather than copies of designer goods			1
other mid-market labels now on the counterfeiters ' hit list include @entity47 , @entity49 wellies , links of @entity51 , ghd hair products and top make - up brands			1
a which ? survey concludes that one in ten shoppers have unwittingly bought a fake , with 7 per cent of goods sold in the @entity60 are said to be counterfeit			1
conned : @entity0 , from @entity62 , with her son @entity16 , 15 months			1
she bought counterfeit @entity6 candles that were a potential deathtrap shopping online is a particular minefield			1
in april , a specialist police unit shut down more than 2,500 websites selling counterfeit goods to @entity60 customers that were believed to be worth tens of millions of pounds			2
but with an estimated 72 million web links to infringing material this year alone , this is a drop in the ocean			0
with @entity1 fast approaching , shoppers are trawling the internet for last - minute bargains — and you can be sure criminals are on the prowl to get some of this money			1
' behind many of these websites lies an organised crime gang funnelling off the money spent by unsuspecting customers on what they think are quality products , ' says detective chief inspector @entity91 , head of the @entity92			0
' consumers also need to be aware that by accessing websites like this they are running the risk of their personal details being compromised and being used for other fraudulent scams , as well as exposing their computer to viruses			0
' a trip to one of @entity104 ' warehouses to the south of @entity106 in @entity104 provides ample evidence of the problem			1
here , the team is working its way through two recent shipments of dodgy goods intercepted at @entity113 , targeted at @entity1 shoppers			1
counterfeit designer goods are worth £ 3 billion a year in the @entity60 — sometimes even experts struggle to spot the fakes among the 5,470 seized items were 1,960 toys , including 426 copies of dolls from the @entity123 film @entity124			1
in the second consignment seized , there were more than 4,000 counterfeit ghd hair straighteners , intended to be passed off as the real thing			0
meanwhile , in a separate locked container are bags of other counterfeit goods that have been confiscated over the past 18 months			2
it 's a roll call of all the most popular @entity134 brands			0
there are piles of @entity138 sweatshirts , fake @entity49 wellies , which usually sell for around £ 90 , sacks full of @entity141 rip - offs and shelves bursting with fake make - up from covetable brands such as @entity145 and @entity146 per cent of these fakes will have hailed from @entity148 but they also come from @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			1
as quickly as officers clamp down on one lot of fake goods , another market springs up as @entity134 fashions and trends change			1
@entity104 regularly seize suspect items			1
out of 5,470 recently seized items 1,960 were toys , including 426 copies of dolls from the @entity123 film @entity124 this year 's incredible boom in frozen merchandise is a case in point			0
the @entity123 film has proved to be the most lucrative ever thanks to the appetite for the spin - off goods			2
but with genuine @entity124 toys in short supply in the run up to @entity1 , sellers peddling counterfeit versions are moving in			2
the new @entity179 is also on the scammers ' hit list			0
copies of a new gadget can be manufactured within two weeks of the genuine product hitting the @entity134 , so counterfeit versions have been flooding in and some are on sale for as little as £ 18 ( the genuine @entity189 version costs more than £ 500 )			0
luxury perfumed candles are another boom — the @entity60 market alone is worth £ 90 million			2
as one of the most popular brands , @entity6 finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes			1
with the imitations costing a maximum of £ 3.50 to produce , there 's some serious money to be made — at someone 's expense			0
regrets : @entity0 realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel @entity0 realised she had been duped the moment she opened her parcel			2
she says : ' the first giveaway was that the jars were not right			0
the glass was quite thick but one of the candles was broken and the rims were n't at all smooth			2
' when i lit one of the candles , it smelt of furniture polish , then spat and crackled like a firework			0
it was a fire risk			0
' angry that she had been tricked , @entity0 contacted the seller , who was selling the fake candles on @entity8 , only to be stonewalled			1
' i think it is despicable that someone was willing to sell fake candles to unsuspecting customers			2
they might be only thinking of making a quick profit but they could have burnt our house down , ' she says			0
@entity0 had a lucky escape			2
candles from another batch of copied @entity6 candles exploded when tested by @entity104			1
counterfeit make - up , meanwhile , can contain banned ingredients such as lead , copper , mercury , arsenic or cadmium , which can lead to swelling , rashes and poisoning			0
test on fake perfumes , meanwhile , have found horse urine and harmful ingredients that can cause allergic and skin - burning reactions			2
@entity255 , of the @entity256 , stresses : ' there are significant risks to buying counterfeit goods , especially electrical products , which could cause fires or shocks — or children 's toys , which could be untested and unsafe			0
' real deal : @entity6 finds itself at the forefront of this battle against fakes but a new breed of ruthless ' entrepreneurs ' purposefully targeting middle - class customers is ignoring these dangers last week , the @entity275 programme @entity276 reported on a case in the @entity278 where two women , @entity280 , 53 , and @entity281 , 44 , were running what amounted to a small cottage industry producing rip - off @entity6 candles			1
they were buying in cheap , wax - filled glass jars and then adding fake @entity6 branding , using stickers printed to look like the original labels			1
they finished off the job with imported copies of the signature engraved lid			0
they were then selling these copycat candles at craft fairs , fetes and markets across the @entity301 at a considerable mark - up			2
when the @entity304 visited @entity306 's sixth - floor flat in @entity307 , @entity51 , they found a mini production line			0
there were more than 200 of the inferior candles in jars , at least 10,000 of the fake labels and 4,000 silver lids			2
' this pair were really making some quite significant profit , ' says @entity316 , the unit 's financial investigator , who estimated the pair had made £ 210,000 from this illegal operation			0
the two women have since been successfully prosecuted at @entity321 , with @entity306 receiving a 12 - month custodial sentence and @entity281 , who played a lesser role , given 240 hours of community service			0
another ploy used by sellers to target middle - class customers is to sell their fake goods at ' hand bag ' parties — the successors to @entity333 parties — or on @entity334 in order to give themselves a veneer of respectability			1
@entity339 , 44 , of @entity340 in @entity341 , sold fake bags for hundreds of pounds by doing this , using her ill - gotten gains to fund a luxury lifestyle that included private school fees , holidays and a new car			2
beware when @entity1 shopping : if a deal looks too good to be true , it probably is in august this year , @entity352 was told that @entity339 sold fake @entity354 bags she 'd bought from counterfeit suppliers in @entity148 and sold them at parties as the real thing			1
she told her middle - class customers that she got hold of them through a contact at @entity354 's factory			1
but disgruntled customers contacted @entity104 when the bags fell to bits			1
when @entity339 's home was searched , a large number of fake @entity354 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity370 bags were seized			0
another of these ' entrepreneurs ' rumbled this year is 27 - year - old accountant @entity374 from @entity375			0
her company @entity376 was doing a roaring trade in fake ghd straighteners and hairdryers imported from @entity148 — which burst into flames just seconds after being switched on			0
@entity383 team leader @entity382 , who helped the prosecution , said a customer could have been seriously injured			0
' it was extremely lucky that this happened during a test , rather than when somebody was using the product , as it could have resulted in serious injury			0
' it seems that as long as our appetite for branded goods continues to grow , so will counterfeiting			0
and that means there are plenty of greedy , shady sellers hoping to swindle consumers who will be left with shoddy or dangerous products			0
it 's not really in the spirit of @entity1 , is it ?			2

more *people* are falling victim to the new wave of ' middle - class fakes '
now @entity104 are seizing thousands of goods
with @entity1 approaching , @entity0 , 38 , wanted top - notch gifts
on a limited budget she fell prey to counterfeiters
@entity0 , from @entity62 , bought fake @entity6 candles
she soon discovered they were a deathtrap
