the haunting signs of lives once lived still echo from every room in this long - abandoned ramshackle ruin			2
@entity4 , a @entity5 listed building , now stands eerily abandoned since 2009 - the clothes , pictures and other remnants from former inhabitants are untouched and lying under a thick layer of dust			1
new photographs from inside the dilapidated cottage , in @entity14 , @entity15 , reveal the eerie atmosphere within the building which would once have been a family home			1
decrepit : @entity4 was abandoned since 2009 and has been left to rot ever since eerie : a coat lies on top of a pile of rubbish and fallen masonry in one of the haunting pictures taken inside one of the rooms @entity31 : @entity32 has changed inside the run - down 300 - year - old @entity4 over the last few years , locals have even reported to have seen lights flickering inside the cottage , leading to rumours that the cottage might be haunted			1
the last occupant was killed in a car crash on the road outside the home			1
urban explorer @entity42 ventured inside after reading about its history online			2
@entity42 , 28 , from @entity46 says : ' the cottage has been in the same family for many years and it looks like each generation has filled the house with their possessions			1
' ' inside , there was everything you would find in a family home - from old photographs and clothes to beds and clocks			1
' the longer i was inside the cottage the atmosphere felt more and more oppressive			1
' memories : the building which was a family home for many years still holds some of the trinkets and photographs collected by its former residents atmospheric : @entity4 is in a state of disrepair but any prospective buyer would have to overcome the haunting atmosphere within the building if they were to renovate it past : old photographs left inside the abandoned ' @entity4 ' hint at a bygone past when the building would have been a fine family home the @entity4 can be found in historic records dating to as early as 17th century			1
it appears the building was a pub or inn under a series of difference names			2
but a local newspaper reports from 1841 show the occupant at the time was a mr @entity92			0
but the 1851 census the owner had changed to @entity95 and his family			2
two years after the census , tragedy struck the @entity100 family with the death of their eldest son @entity102 , aged 33 , on 22 october 1853			0
details of the occupants through much of the 19th century are sketchy			0
but the last person thought to have lived in the @entity4 was @entity107 , 72 , who died on tuesday , october 22nd , 2013 , after his car collided with a lorry on the road outside the house			1
the crumbling cottage consists of seven rooms - one entirely burnt out from a fire and another completely collapsed			1
upstairs in one of the bedrooms , lay discarded clothes and empty shoe boxes - in another hangs framed portraits of what could have been residents who once inhabited the home			0
newspaper editions from the 1960s lay strewn across the burnt out floors offering a flashback to the past			0
@entity42 says : ' i 'm not a huge believer in ghosts , but at one point a small ornament fell over , as if it was pushed quickly			0
' the cottage really is on its last legs , very structurally unsafe and could fall any day now			0
' built in the seventeenth century and originally named ' the @entity137 ' , the cottage has had many uses over the years			1
initially , the cottage was part of a farm , and then the property became a pub called ' @entity144 '			2
years later the pub was closed and the cottage turned into a mini brewery where beers and ciders were produced			2
more recently , the cottage provided a backdrop to a horrific car accident that saw a 72 - year - old man tragically killed in october 2013			1
the victim of the crash is believed to be one of the cottage 's last remaining residents named @entity107			1
according to local historical records , mr @entity107 lived at the cottage with his two brothers @entity161 and @entity162 , but has since lay abandoned			1
@entity42 says : ' i hope the cottage and the objects inside can be saved			2
' the vast history is amazing and it should not be left to rot			0
' i hope the current owner can fully restore it one day			0
' the main reason i started urban exploring is because i love to capture the beauty that can be found in decaying buildings and objects inside			0
' glimpse at a former life : urban explorer @entity42 ventured into the eerie interior of the old abandoned cottage to take a series of haunting images forgotten : the abandoned building would have once echoed to the sound of children laughing and playing with their toys - now unloved and gathering dust faith : a sign reading ' the lord is my strength ' still hangs above one of the beds inside the crumbling ruing of @entity4 abandoned : @entity4 in @entity14 , @entity15 , has been the scene of a number of tragedies during its 200 year history undergrowth : @entity200 and other creepers have found a home amongst the detritus from former residents of @entity4 sings of those who once made a home in @entity4 still litter the interior - including cupboards full of cups and saucers ghostly : a dressing table , including a comb and mirror , have been left to gather dust in one of the bedrooms of @entity4 decoration : a few pictures cling to the flaking walls of @entity4 in @entity14 , @entity15 dated : old moisturiser bottles left inside the abandoned ' @entity4 ' , in @entity14 , @entity15 , hark back to a bygone era echoes : tucked amongst the cobwebs and dusty light bulbs is a portrait of a young boy who may once have played in the eerie corridors of the @entity4 inhospitable : until just four years ago the @entity4 was a home to people but it has now been left to rot signs of life : @entity235 mugs sit on the cupboard shelve behind a thin screen of cobwebs a day in time : a local newspaper gives a snapshot of life inside the abandoned @entity4 , located in @entity14 , @entity15 revealing : wedding and family photographs tell the story of those who once called the eerie and now abandoned @entity4 home recollection : an old @entity250 newspaper sits among a pile of old photographs and flaking interior inside the abandoned @entity4 , in @entity14 , @entity15 @entity254 adorns the cover of the @entity257 colour section in one of the many newspapers collected by the @entity4 's inhabitants anyone contemplating reviving the @entity137 's past as a guest house might be able to trade on its ghostly past			1
but it would have to some way to vying with @entity268 for the title of @entity271 ’s most haunted @entity270			0
the guesthouse , in the village of @entity274 , @entity275 , is believed to be riddled with up to 20 spectres who torment the paying punters of the 12th century home			2
built on an ancient pagan burial ground - and also believed to be the scene of child sacrifices and devil worship - the @entity285 cottage is haunted by the likes of a murdered young girl called @entity288 , a high priestess , and even a male sex demon , known as an incubus			1
the strange goings on include a blood - curdling child ’s scream , ‘ electrified ’ wooden beams , and even the touch of an invisible force			0
@entity298 , whose family has lived in the @entity268 for nearly 50 years , said : ' my father wo n’t go anywhere without his @entity303			0
' but despite its ghoulish reputation , ms @entity298 is inundated with visitors who are desperate to spend a night in @entity271 ’s spookiest lodgings , which were built in 1145 and costs between £ 25 and £ 30 per night			0
past guests have fled from the house in the middle of the night after claiming to have seen furniture flying around the bedrooms , visions of a little girl wandering the hallways , and have even been pushed down onto a bed by a randy incubus			0
