by @entity1 reporter published : 08:21 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 10:36 est , 5 september 2013 the hand - lettered donation jar on @entity4 's store counter says what many residents of this well - preserved victorian - era town are thinking and feeling lately : ' keep @entity8 in @entity8			1
' the surviving sons of the famous @entity11 athlete have long fought to get the remains of their father moved from @entity8 , @entity14 , to tribal lands in @entity16 , where he was born , and they recently won a crucial legal victory that put them close to their goal			1
but @entity8 is n't letting its @entity21 namesake go without a fight			2
residents and business owners are helping to raise money for the town 's appeal -- to be filed later this month -- saying they have honored , appreciated and respected a man long considered one of the 20th century 's best athletes			1
' we have no intention of letting him go , ' said @entity4 , an organizer of the town 's annual @entity8 birthday bash			1
' there is a pride , and many , many people that you speak to as you go through the town share that pride			0
' @entity8 was a football , baseball and track star who won the decathlon and pentathlon in the @entity60 , then later starred as the @entity61 in b - movies and struggled financially toward the end of his life			2
he died without a will in 1953 at age 64			0
after @entity16 's governor balked at the cost of a planned monument to the athlete , third wife @entity71 had @entity8 's body removed in the midst of his funeral service and sent it to northeastern @entity14 , where she struck a deal with two merging towns -- @entity8 and @entity78 -- to build a memorial and name the new town after him			1
his remains are kept in a mausoleum surrounded by statues and interpretive signage			0
@entity8 's son , @entity87 , of @entity88 , @entity89 , said his father expressed a desire to be buried in @entity16			1
@entity8 throws the shot put during the @entity60 in @entity93			2
he won the decathlon and pentathlon at the games , taking first place in six events , including the shot put @entity8 goes into training at his home in @entity102 , @entity103 , where he does miles of roadwork daily			0
he is shown carrying his sons : @entity106 , age 4 , and @entity108 , age 3 ' all this time we 've wanted his body back because of the way that it was taken away from us , ' he said			0
' and we had no authority			0
' in april , @entity33 district judge @entity114 ruled in favor of @entity8 , his brother @entity8 , and the @entity117 and @entity118 tribe to which their father belonged , saying the town amounts to a museum under the 1990 @entity122			1
the borough council voted to appeal the ruling to the @entity126 - based 3rd @entity33 @entity125 , and written arguments are due sept. 23			0
the town has found support from @entity8 's grandsons , who say it has done right by him			1
' the town has done nothing but honor and respect and love my grandpa , ' said @entity138 , of @entity139 , @entity103 ' the state of @entity16 did not want to erect a mausoleum or do anything to honor him			2
they were n't willing to do what the town of @entity8 did			2
' the surviving sons of famed @entity11 athlete @entity8 won a crucial legal victory in april 2013 that put them close to their goal of bringing their father 's remains from the @entity14 town named for him to tribal lands in @entity16 , where he was born @entity8 said he was taking part in a sweat lodge ceremony in @entity89 three years ago when , unbidden , a medicine man told him his grandfather had made contact and said , ' i am at peace , and i want no more pain created in my name			1
' he said that helped confirm his belief that his grandfather 's tomb should remain where it is			0
so what will happen if @entity8 's body is no longer there ? the borough on the western edge of @entity14 's @entity172 is popular with tourists and frequently appears on lists of @entity33 's prettiest towns			1
but that is due largely to its vibrant main street , stunning mansions and location at the bottom of a steep gorge carved by the @entity183			0
few come specifically to visit @entity8 's roadside memorial , and the town 's economy certainly is n't dependent on its connection to the man			1
legendary athlete @entity8 is pictured in boxing gear on june 26 , 1935 @entity8 is pictured in a baseball uniform in 1914			2
he died without a will in 1953 at age 64 but the psychological loss will be undeniable			0
the athlete who never set foot in the town named after him has become an important part of its identity			1
the high school 's athletic teams are named , after all , the @entity21			0
' look , if it turns out that @entity8 is going to be transported somewhere else , then let 's accompany him and make it as graceful and honorable a transition as it could possibly be , ' said @entity207 , co-owner of the @entity208 in @entity8			2
' and let 's shake the hands of the new people who are going to be caring for him			0
but we will still continue to do our part to remember who he was and remember his name			0
