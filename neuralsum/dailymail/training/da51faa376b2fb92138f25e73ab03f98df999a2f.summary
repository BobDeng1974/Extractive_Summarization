from the lack of leg room to annoying reclining seats , the frustrations for plane passengers travelling long - haul in economy class seats have been well documented			1
so one award - winning designer is taking it into his own hands to encourage airlines to improve comfort for travellers			1
@entity14 , who has won accolades for his forward - thinking concepts , has revealed his plans for new long - haul seats with @entity20 - based company @entity19			1
as well as seats with a reclining backrest and a tray with a tablet stand , holidaymakers will also be able to relax on flights with a footrest under the chair in front of them			2
potentially spelling the end to elbow wars among travellers sitting next to each other , @entity14 's @entity50 seat concept also includes a dual - use armrest			1
end of elbow wars ? the new - look seats would have a dual - use armrest which passengers could share comfort : @entity14 's @entity50 concept includes a footrest for passengers travelling economy class the design allows both passengers to use it - with a raised front so that space is n't restricted and that neighbours ' arms do n't touch			1
the sleeper backrest seats offer an alternative to traditional recliner mode to allow passengers to relax - and could mean the end to passengers ' knees being crushed			0
the lower portion of the backrest cushion detaches , pushing the traveller forward in a ' deep recline ' position , allowing them to stretch their legs out in front			0
and the tablet stand works when the tray is locked in a half - open position , with enough room to support an @entity29 or tablet on the grooves in the edge of the stand			2
future design : the cup holder on planes would be separate to the tray , meaning tables could be stowed away seats would have compartments for sunglasses and water bottles - taking away the full - width seat pocket entertainment : the dual - use armrest would feature a hook for headphones - making them easier to stow away @entity14 's design plans also include a fixed cup holder - meaning the tray could be stowed away - a personal cabinet below the table , replacing the seat pocket , and a box footrest - in which airlines could store electronics			1
the designer , who has won various prices in the travel industry , said he also sought to address airline 's cost concerns when compiling the concept			2
explaining the design , the website said : ' the meerkat is a concept design for long haul economy class seating that enhances passenger experience while minimising weight and maintenance costs			1
adaptable : @entity19 's @entity131 seat can work in both the economy and business cabins ' passengers today are far more focused on comfort			2
' however , airlines need to balance costs with fancy facilities			0
weight reduction is especially critical since it has a direct bearing on the amount of fuel consumed particularly on long flights			0
' @entity50 seeks to satisfy both sides			0
' it introduces a number of innovative features with minimal weight and complexity			0
the @entity149 is a seat for passengers as well as a seat for airlines			0
' elbow room : the @entity19 design means that both passengers can use the armrest versatile : @entity14 hopes that his design will be incorporated into both aircraft and trains other designs by @entity14 were unveiled at this year 's influential @entity162 , held in @entity163 in northern @entity164			1
the imaginative ‘ @entity131 ’ seat – which has already won awards thanks to its versatility - was also mooted			0
futuristic and flexible , the @entity131 can be both a cheaper seating option in the economy cabin – or can be reconfigured as something rather more exclusive in business class , with the capacity to spread out as a flat bed			0
and @entity14 has won awards for his two - teared armrest and now , after patenting the product in the @entity177 and @entity178 , he is hoping the idea will catch on for planes , trains and even cinemas .			2
