her size brought gasps from the staff in the operating room of @entity17 , who say she is the biggest baby to be born at the hospital in a decade			1
@entity20 and beautiful : @entity6 and @entity21 with their baby @entity12 , who was the size of a six - month - old when she was born record - breaker : @entity12 is the biggest baby to born in @entity2 for a decade ' everyone in the operating room was like , " @entity27 , look at the size of this baby ! letâ € ™ s get her on the scale			1

at 14lb 5oz , @entity34 is the biggest baby born at @entity17 in a decade , and second heaviest ever born there			0
the record holder for the @entity2 hospital is a baby born in 2002 , who weighed 14lb 80z			2

it just makes sense , ' mrs @entity6 told @entity64			2

the couple 's two - year - old daughter , @entity68 , had weighed 10lb 10oz so the parents were n't surprised , although mrs @entity6 said she had been far more uncomfortable with the pregnancy			1
' it validated me because i was in a lot of pain when i was pregnant , so to hear the size , it made sense , ' the new mom said			0
she added that in the final month of her pregnancy she had got fed up with people stopping her in the street to ask if she was carrying twins			0
dr @entity84 , who helped with the delivery , said : ' we were expecting a big baby , but we were n't expecting one quite that big			0
' surprised : dr @entity84 , pictured with @entity6 and @entity21 , says they did n't expect @entity90 , center , to be quite as large as she was ' the baby came out screaming and crying and it was a beautiful delivery , ' she said , adding that neither mom or baby had diabetes			1
mr @entity21 told @entity97 : ' when she came out at 14 and a half pounds , i could n't believe it			0
i took a picture of the scale just to document it because i could n't believe how big she was			0
' @entity12 may be nearly twice the average 7.5lb weight of a newborn , but she is happy and healthy and due to go home with her parents on friday .			1
