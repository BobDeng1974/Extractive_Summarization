the owners of a swingers club in rural @entity2 , @entity3 , have agreed to move on after a wave of furious backlash from their neighbors			1
@entity7 and @entity8 have been throwing weekly erotic parties in their 4,860 - square - foot leased home dubbed ' @entity11 ' since may 2014			1

despite initially fighting the claim , the couple have decided to close their lease and take the party elsewhere			1
' we 're moving on , ' mr @entity8 told the @entity23			1
' the city of @entity2 is n't going to get our $ 14,000 in taxes every year			1
though the club did not charge guests , party - goers were encouraged to make donations : $ 80 for couples , $ 20 for single women , and $ 80 for single men			2
the city held that these donations rake in thousands of dollars a night for @entity11 , but @entity8 and mrs @entity52 claim all profits are used for snacks and drinks			1
while some of the neighborhood 's residents questioned the morality of the establishment that offers food , drinks , and condoms , city officials said it is a zoning issue			2

but officials said they believed @entity11 's clientele were partying all over the house			1
the city also held that @entity11 is a business operating out of a single - family home because of its regular hours of operation ( each weekend from 8.30pm to 3am ) , its promotional advertising , and its services which include a valet for the guests and sometimes laundry service			1
on thursday , mr @entity8 said he spoke with the owner , @entity79 , and they decided it would be ' mutually agreeable ' to move the parties elsewhere			1
he said : ' we ’re still gon na throw parties wherever we move			2
that ’s how we like to spend our free time			0
' i know one neighbor who had a burr up his butt is probably doing a dance because we ’re leaving , but it does n’t bother us one bit			0
' this had nothing to do with zoning			0
we could say we ’re no longer taking donations			0
it would not have mattered in the least to the neighbors and the city			2

but we were under no delusions			0
this was all about morality			0
