the chain of bakery cafes , which has about 1,800 @entity14 locations , is making the pledge as part of a ' @entity17 ' it is unveiling tuesday that outlines its commitment to ' clean ' and ' simple ' ingredients			2
the announcement comes at a time when @entity1 is facing slowing sales growth and working to jumpstart its business through a variety of means , such as revamping the sometimes confusing way people order and get food and switching baking hours to the daytime to create a homier feel in cafes			0
change of taste : @entity1 is making a pledge to remove artificial colors , flavors , sweeteners and preservatives from its menu items by 2016 the unveiling of @entity1 's sweeping ' @entity17 ' also underscores how positioning foods as natural has become a marketing advantage , regardless of whether it brings any nutritional benefits			1
part of the attraction for customers is that they feel better about what they 're eating , sometimes because they do n't feel as guilty about how many calories they 're consuming			0
@entity54 , for instance , has gained in popularity in part by portraying itself as a more wholesome alternative to traditional fast - food chains like @entity60 's			1

healthier options : @entity71 - based @entity1 said it is about halfway through removing artificial ingredients from its menu , but is still looking for ways to remove artificial colors and preservatives from products such as its bakery icings among the additives that will be dumped from these @entity1 foods : still , declaring foods as being natural or free of artificial ingredients has the potential to invite criticism and even legal troubles			1
a lawsuit filed in november , for instance , alleges that @entity88 uses a ' spectacular array ' of artificial ingredients in some of its store - brand products , despite the grocer 's promise that the products contain ' nothing artificial			1
' @entity1 also is n't swearing off genetically modified ingredients , another issue that is gaining attention in certain circles			0
unlike @entity54 , which says its menu will soon be free of @entity102 , @entity1 uses too many different ingredients to be able to make that claim			1

it 's still looking for ways to removes the artificial colors used in its bakery icings , for instance , and is testing a smoked ham in select markets that does n't use artificial preservatives			1

ten years ago , for instance , @entity1 announced that it would use chicken raised without antibiotics , a move @entity128 said helped significantly drive sales			2
@entity1 's new policy also states the chain 's commitment to ' transparency , ' meaning it will make it easy for people to see the ingredients and nutritional content of its food			0
it also says it will work to have a ' positive impact ' on the food system , such as by supporting @entity152 suppliers whenever possible			0
whether the new policy helps attract more customers is yet to be seen			0
last year , @entity1 's sales rose 2.6 percent at company - owned locations open at least a year			2
that was down from 6.5 percent in 2012 and 4.9 percent in 2011			0
