couple : the new archbishop of @entity2 , the most rev @entity1 , keeps an eye on his drinking the archbishop of @entity2 has asked his wife to monitor his drinking , he admitted yesterday			1
@entity1 , who is to be enthroned as leader of the @entity10 church this week , said his father had been an alcoholic and he feared going down the same road himself			1
he said he has an agreement with his wife @entity3 to tell him if he is drinking too much and that he takes care never to drink alone			1
dr @entity1 disclosed his worries in an interview in which he spoke of his father who was a bootlegger and socialite in the @entity18 before settling in @entity19			1
‘ you never knew what was going to happen , ’ dr @entity1 said			1
‘ the experience of living with a parent who had a drink problem is very shaping as to one ’s views of what human beings are like			1
’ he added that his father had engaged in ‘ very erratic behaviour , very irrational , dishonesty , shouting			2
then , of course , one worries how much of this is how one is going to behave oneself ’			2
dr @entity1 said his childhood experience had ‘ absolutely not ’ made him a teetotaller			1
‘ i very much enjoy a drink , ’ he said			1
‘ i remember reading that the children of alcoholics have a much better chance themselves of having a dependency problem			1
‘ so @entity3 and i have an agreement that she keeps an eye on me , so she ’ll say if i am going over ... but i have rules myself			2
i do n’t drink alone , things like that			2
’ in a wide - ranging interview in advance of his enthronement at @entity2 on thursday , the @entity1 said he believed that sex outside marriage was wrong			1
‘ i have no sense of moral outrage over sexuality in any particular direction , ’ he added			2
‘ i ’m far too conscious of my own weaknesses to start hurling rocks at people			2
‘ my understanding of sexual ethics has been that , regardless of whether it ’s gay or straight , sex outside marriage is wrong			0
now that gets me into all kinds of difficulty			0
we do n’t have to be obsessive			0
the trouble is in the @entity66 we get totally hooked on sexual sin			0
it ’s not the thing that most concerns me			0
marriage : @entity1 and his wife @entity3 ( pictured at @entity73 last november ) have five children ‘ people move in together , they have partners , they are not legally married ; but there is a profound sense of commitment to each other , which is of intrinsic value			1
’ the archbishop said the government ’s same - sex marriage plan , which is being championed by @entity85 , was ‘ a bad piece of legislation ’			1
he distinguished himself from his predecessor @entity88 – who frequently suggested that capitalism is a destructive force – by praising the work of banks			0
the former oil industry chief said : ‘ the efficient allocation of capital is a good , enabling companies to grow			0
‘ one thing i learned over years working in @entity98 is that the absence of financial services is a severe bad			0
it is not a good thing at all			0
it makes human flourishing and wellbeing much harder to achieve , in fact , impossible			0
‘ but you can do the right thing in such a way it becomes the wrong thing			0
’ dr @entity1 said that had happened in the financial world			1
he also spoke about the death of his seven - month - old daughter , @entity114 , who lived for five days after being flung out of a car in a crash in @entity117 in 1983			2
‘ for me and @entity3 , @entity114 ’s death and the few days after the accident and before she died were the most utter agony , ’ he said			0
‘ yet at the same time the presence of @entity122 was more clearly present than at any time in my life or @entity3 ’s			0
it ’s a very rare day that i do n’t think of @entity114			0

father - of - four most rev @entity1 admits : ' i very much enjoy a drink '
@entity131 alcoholics ' children are more likely to develop dependency problems
