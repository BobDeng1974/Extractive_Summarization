the @entity10 , who takes over from sir @entity2 in july , compared the @entity3 with basket case countries in the eurozone in a brutal assessment of the economic outlook			1
speaking on the fringes of the @entity19 ’s spring meetings in @entity20 , he said : ‘ the @entity21 is breaking out of the pack of crisis economies that include the eurozone , the @entity3 and @entity25			1
’ it came after the @entity19 this week slashed its growth forecasts for the @entity3 over the next two years and warned that @entity28 is ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with his programme of tax hikes and spending cuts			1
the @entity19 could now officially recommend that the chancellor ditch his harsh austerity package – possibly as soon as next month – in what would be a humiliating setback for mr @entity28			2
the @entity19 last year warned that @entity3 would have to slow its package of cuts if the economy did not pick up pace			1
mr @entity1 ’s use of the world ‘ crisis ’ will not have lifted mr @entity28 ’s mood after sir @entity2 recently stressed that only a ‘ gentle recovery ’ is under way			2
the new governor also made it clear that he and the @entity8 can not be expected to solve the @entity3 ’s economic problems alone – another warning to mr @entity28 who has placed great faith in his skills			2
mr @entity1 , who will be the highest paid central bank governor in the world with an annual income of £ 874,000 , including a generous @entity58 housing allowance , indicated that he was prepared to take aggressive action to support the recovery when he takes over			2
but he added : ‘ can central banks provide sustainable growth ? no. they can help with the transition , but they ca n’t deliver long term growth			0
the new governor also made it clear that he and the @entity8 ( pictured ) can not be expected to solve the @entity3 ¿ s economic problems alone ' that needs to come through true fiscal adjustments and necessary structural reforms			0
sustainable growth comes from the private sector			0
’ mr @entity1 , the first foreigner to be put in charge of the @entity8 in its 319 - year history , indicated he would interpret @entity3 ’s inflation target of 2 per cent more flexibly – suggesting he would allow it to remain high for longer			1
@entity19 managing director @entity75 also said that central banks around the world ‘ can not be the only game in town ’ when it comes to restoring economies to health			0
she said governments must also tackle deficits and implement reforms ‘ so there is a mix that allows central bankers to be relieved of the weight they carry on their shoulders ’			0
her comments on the state of the @entity3 economy were more measured than those of @entity19 chief economist @entity96 , who said this week that @entity3 was ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with austerity			1
the @entity19 could officially recommend that @entity28 ditches his austerity package asked whether she agreed with mr @entity96 , mrs @entity75 said : ‘ we have said that should growth abate then there should be consideration to adjusting by slowing the pace			2
‘ the growth numbers are certainly not particularly good			0
so , in a sense , this is a continuation of the position			0
what has changed is clearly the quality of the numbers			0
’ although she did not go as far as mr @entity96 and say that austerity should be ditched , her comments suggested that the @entity19 ’s health - check on the @entity3 economy next month will make grim reading for the chancellor			1
mrs @entity75 said that the inspection team , which is expected to be led by her @entity21 deputy @entity120 , would seek ‘ to really go under the skin ’ of the @entity3 economy			0
under the terms of its membership of the @entity19 , @entity3 must undergo a thorough inspection each year known as an @entity127 review			1
@entity19 experts will crawl over all the @entity3 ’s accounts and ask hard questions of officials at the @entity132 , the @entity8 , the @entity133 and other bodies			1
the inspection usually takes up to a month , followed by a press conference when the @entity19 ’s advice is issued			0
any formal recommendation from the @entity19 that a change of course is required will be seized upon by shadow chancellor @entity140 who has long argued for a @entity141 mrs @entity75 added : ‘ i would not , and i do n’t think anybody in this institution would want to pre-judge ahead of @entity127 because we spend three four weeks , discussing , debating , understanding trying to get under the skin of each economy and we will for that			0
