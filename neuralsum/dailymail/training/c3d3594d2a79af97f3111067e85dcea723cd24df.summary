this was the scenario @entity2 must have feared as the @entity4 team bus drove away from @entity5 on monday night			0
watching @entity6 beat @entity7 3 - 2 at @entity8 last saturday , @entity2 detected nerves — some fatigue — in the ranks of his @entity13 rivals			1
there was , the @entity4 manager thought , something left to play for this season			0
in south @entity19 , though , all that changed			0
it changed the league table but , more importantly , it changed the context , the whole feel , of this occasion on wednesday night			2
one hand on the title : @entity27 ( right ) celebrates putting @entity6 in front ton wednesday night blown it : @entity30 ( right ) and @entity31 react after @entity4 draw with @entity32 on monday night @entity4 ’s late capitulation against @entity32 afforded @entity6 vital breathing space and @entity2 knew it			1
here in the rain at the @entity38 , @entity36 ’s team moved into that space and breathed hard			1
for a while , they had to			0
this was an unconvincing effort for long periods from the champions - elect			2
they scored four goals in the end and it ’s a round 100 for the @entity13 season now			1
three of those goals came late here , though			2
they came once the pressure valve had been released by @entity27 ’s goal in the 64th minute			1
prior to that , @entity6 had an awful lot of possession and did n’t do an awful lot with it			1
as @entity2 sensed , they looked tired and uncertain			0
in drawing at @entity32 , however , @entity4 had left the wriggle room they needed			0
although @entity6 laboured hard for an hour , it never got that tense			1
they did n’t have to			0
a draw would have been enough , given @entity6 ’s goal difference advantage and , on the whole , @entity68 never looked like scoring			1
so , in the end , @entity6 won the game and they won it well			1
now they will win the title and deservedly so			2
blown it : @entity2 watches on as his side throw away a 3 - 0 advantage at @entity5 any team — no matter how many championships they have won — will feel the pressure when the season nears its end			1
the simple things become a little less simple , decision - making becomes more complicated and less instinctive			2
had @entity4 not erred so spectacularly at @entity32 on monday , they may have seen evidence of this in their rivals			0
they would have witnessed experienced international footballers begin to doubt themselves			0
as it was , @entity6 bumped along the road to victory without conviction , but also without any great fear that things were about to go badly wrong			1
@entity36 never took anything for granted			1
in his programme notes , the @entity97 called on his club ’s supporters to help out			0
against @entity102 here last month , @entity6 ’s fans had been dreadfully flat and @entity36 believed his team suffered as a result that night			1
for a long time here , though , it was hard for the supporters not to betray some misgivings			0
@entity6 began slowly , nervously , and grew steadily worse for an hour			1
not until the last minute of the opening half did we think they had scored , @entity109 somehow diverting @entity113 ’s cross from the right wide of goal			0
sitter : @entity109 spurns a glorious opportunity just before half - time city looked leaden - footed and lacking in pace for long periods			2
@entity122 and the endearing @entity123 worked well together but , that apart , inspiration was hard to come by			0
some of these players were involved when @entity127 ’s @entity6 team squeaked home against @entity129 on the final day two seasons ago			1
maybe they felt the chill of the flashback before kick - off			0
unfortunately for those who were seeking a little unexpected drama , @entity68 were a side safe from harm			1
as such , nothing much was expected of them , certainly not by @entity2 and @entity4 , and @entity141 ’s men surprised nobody			0
until the first goal , @entity68 were energetic and organised and committed			2
they offered hardly anything when they had the ball , though			0
it is problem that has plagued @entity68 boss @entity141 all season and it bothered him again on this occasion			2
ton up : @entity149 scored @entity6 's fourth , and their 100th goal of the @entity13 season twice in the first half @entity68 did break with intent			1
on both occasions , though , they were betrayed by finishing that lacked confidence			0
as he watched at home , @entity2 must have suffered			0
he always knew that @entity6 were far from certain to win their final two games			2
he also knew , however , that neither @entity68 nor @entity160 would beat them , not at this stage of the season			1
ultimately , @entity6 ’s goals came in a rush			1
the last 20 minutes resembled the start of a title party			0
@entity149 ’s last - minute goal was wonderful			1
had they really needed those goals , they may not have arrived			0
pressure , real pressure , does odd things			0
what will haunt @entity2 all summer is that he never gave @entity6 that problem			2
agony : @entity4 could not put @entity6 under pressure by picking up the win they needed			2

@entity6 beat @entity68 4 - 0 *yesterday* at the @entity38
goals from @entity27 , @entity181 and @entity149 propelled @entity6 to the top of the @entity13 table
a draw against @entity160 on *sunday* would secure title for @entity36 's squad
