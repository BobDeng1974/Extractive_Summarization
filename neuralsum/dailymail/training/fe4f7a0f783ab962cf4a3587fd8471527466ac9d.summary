by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:23 est , 18 august 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 19 august 2012 speaking out : @entity2 , pictured holding a portrait of @entity4 , believes parts of her 20 - year - old son 's body were retained without her permission a mother whose guardsman son was killed by a @entity12 bomb in @entity13 has called for an inquiry after discovering parts of his body ‘ went missing ’ following his return to @entity17			1
@entity2 believes 20 - year - old @entity4 ’s arms and hands were retained without her permission			1
when her son ’s coffin was opened so she could take a lock of his hair , she was shocked to discover that his arms and hands had been replaced by padding under his uniform			1
yet a post-mortem report mentioned injuries to both arms and hands , and even noted a tattoo of his girlfriend ’s name on one arm			1
mrs @entity2 , 49 , has repeatedly raised her concerns with the @entity37 over the past three years , but has never received the answers she desperately needs			1
she has only broken her silence now that the @entity40 have admitted breaking rules and keeping the body parts of other dead soldiers at the @entity44 in @entity45 – where her own son ’s post-mortem examination was held			1
when @entity4 died in 2009 , then prime minister @entity48 famously misspelt his name in a handwritten letter of condolence to his mother			1
but the enduring question of why her son ’s bomb - damaged hands and arms had been removed without permission has caused mrs @entity2 far deeper anguish than the controversy over mr @entity48 ’s note			1
yesterday , the @entity37 announced that another soldier from @entity4 ’s unit , 1st @entity64 , was killed in @entity65 on sentry duty			1
@entity4 – a soldier from the age of 16 – died on foot patrol in @entity69 , central @entity65 , on october 5 , 2009 , blown up by an improvised explosive device which also wounded three of his colleagues			1
he was pronounced dead after failed resuscitation attempts on a rescue helicopter and at the field hospital at @entity75			1
afterwards , his body was escorted by the military police ’s @entity77 ( @entity79 ) from the operating theatre to the mortuary at @entity75 and on his repatriation flight to @entity17 , arriving on the morning of october 9			1
once his body had been repatriated at @entity84 in @entity85 on the same day , it was transported by the @entity79 to the @entity44			2
the @entity86 has seen documents confirming that a @entity88 of the @entity79 accompanied the remains in a sealed bag which was opened at the hospital and identified to warrant officer @entity92 , of the @entity79 ’s @entity93			2
the body was stored in a secure refrigerator , awaiting a post-mortem examination by @entity98 pathologist dr @entity97			2
dr @entity97 ’s report of october 12 , 2009 – seen by this newspaper – recorded multiple wounds and referred to @entity4 ’s hands and left arm being badly ‘ disrupted ’ – a medical term meaning the normal shape had been altered after layers of tissue were blown apart			1
and in his ‘ descriptions ’ he makes note of ‘ a tattoo which appeared to read “ @entity112 ” running vertically down the outer aspect of the left upper arm ’			2
there were also mentions of injuries to forearms , elbows , wrists and fingers			2
afterwards , @entity4 ’s body was photographed and routine dna tests carried out			2
on october 16 , @entity79 officers took the body to @entity125 , a repatriation and funeral company contracted by the @entity37 there , @entity4 was dressed in his ceremonial red tunic , white gloves and black boots			2
on october 19 , mrs @entity2 was driven to a @entity132 chapel of rest to see her son ’s body for the first time , but she only glimpsed his head and shoulders as the coffin lid was only moved partway			1
afterwards , his coffin was screwed shut			2
shocking discovery : @entity2 asked for her son 's coffin to be opened when his body was taken to this @entity148 funeral home , it was there she discovered his limbs were missing she then drove in convoy with the undertakers from @entity154 ’s chapel of rest to a local firm , @entity157 of @entity158			1
wanting to take a lock of her son ’s hair , mrs @entity2 asked undertaker @entity162 to unscrew the casket lid			1
mrs @entity2 , who has another son currently serving in @entity13 , says when she looked inside @entity4 ’s coffin his hands and arms had ‘ disappeared ’			1
her account is supported by @entity169			2
in the front room of mrs @entity2 ’s terraced home in @entity174 in @entity148 , on the edge of the @entity176 , photographs of @entity4 in his uniform are all around and his beret , medals and ceremonial belt hold pride of place in a glass case			1
on the coffee table , piles of documents attest to her three - year battle for answers from the @entity37 ‘ i wanted to bury all of @entity4 , ’ she said			2
‘ i think parts of him have been dumped somewhere			2
this is horrific , shocking			2
i wo n’t rest until i find out what they ’ve done to him			2
’ how did the scandal of soldiers ’ retained body parts come to light ? an @entity37 whistleblower contacted the media to claim that at least 60 items of human tissue and major body parts of soldiers killed in @entity13 were being illegally kept against the rules of the forensic department by the @entity203 , both at their hq and @entity45 ’s @entity44			1
what does the law say ? under the @entity208 2006 , it is illegal to remove , store or use human tissue without consent , or to store tissue or organs for a purpose not stated			2
penalties include a fine and up to three years in jail			2
why was the act brought in ? the organ - retention scandal at @entity220 ’s @entity219 in 1999 brought issues such as consent and tissue use and storage under the spotlight			0
it became apparent that existing laws needed updating			0
are the rules different for soldiers ’ bodies ? post-mortem examinations on members of the @entity234 killed in combat are carried out under the jurisdiction of a @entity98 coroner			1
tissue samples required as part of the investigation are retained under the @entity241			1
the samples must be stored on behalf of the coroner until an investigation is complete and written instructions on the relatives ’ wishes are received			0
what action has the @entity37 taken ? the @entity37 has refused to reveal if anyone has been disciplined over the scandal but says it has contacted the families involved to inform them and apologise			0
mrs @entity2 ’s doubts began as soon as @entity4 was flown home			1
she said : ‘ i was introduced to a lot of officers at @entity4 ’s repatriation ceremony at @entity84			0
i asked a lot of questions , about the incident and the state of @entity4 ’s body			0
‘ eventually , they told me he had lost his legs but that he had arms and hands			1
they seemed very awkward speaking to me			0
‘ as we got closer to the funeral , i was getting more and more suspicious about what had happened to @entity4 and what state he was in			0
@entity4 ’s officers were being evasive so i wanted to see for myself			0
‘ i also wanted a lock of his hair			0
so i asked @entity162 if she would unscrew the coffin , we could cut off some hair and check the body ourselves			0
‘ @entity162 removed the lid of the coffin and felt down @entity4 ’s arms and looked inside his gloves as i was standing next to her			1
there was padding where @entity4 ’s arms and hands should have been			1
she said : “ @entity2 , i am sorry			1
i would like to tell you his parts are there but they are not			0
” ’ mrs @entity162 confirmed : ‘ by feel and looking , i could tell there were n’t any limbs there			0
removing parts of the body should not be part of the preparing or embalming process			0
’ mrs @entity2 added : ‘ i was devastated , as any mother would have been			1
what had they done with the rest of his body ? i rang all the officers from @entity4 ’s battalion but i did n’t get any answers			0
‘ i received the post-mortem report in march 2010 and was horrified			0
what had happened to @entity4 ’s hands after they were inspected by dr @entity97 ? i rang his office but i was told he was unwell			1
‘ then i was watching the news last week and i heard that the @entity203 had been caught out retaining body tissue at the @entity44 , where @entity4 was examined , and i thought : i am going to speak out publicly			0
i am not going to wait any longer for answers			0
as his mother , i am entitled to be told , even if it is an entirely appropriate process			1
what happened to these bits of him ? ’ a spokesman for the @entity37 said : ‘ the @entity37 is dealing with this case as a matter of urgency and an investigation has been launched			0
our foremost concern is always to support the families of the deceased and our thoughts and concerns remain with them			0
we make sure the return home of all our fallen comrades to their families is conducted with the utmost dignity and respect			0
’ the @entity86 tried to contact dr @entity97 , but he was on holiday			0
a colleague at the @entity337 said : ‘ we spend a lot of time ensuring where possible that all body parts are repatriated with the deceased for burial or cremation			0
we certainly would not just throw body parts away			0
a spokesman for @entity347 , which runs the @entity348 , said : ‘ forensic post-mortem examinations on members of the @entity234 killed in combat are undertaken under the jurisdiction of a @entity98 coroner			1
‘ tissue samples are stored in an entirely secure and respectful manner until no longer required by the coroner			0
and the families have expressed their wishes			0
’ a spokesman for @entity125 declined to comment ‘ due to the terms of our @entity37 contract ’			0
@entity48 managed to turn a humanitarian gesture into a political catastrophe when he handwrote a letter of condolence to @entity366 in 2009			0
the then prime minister ’s note was full of spelling errors , and most notably it began : ‘ dear mrs @entity370			0
’ he also spelt @entity4 incorrectly and corrected it by writing over the last letter			0
the other mistakes were : @entity374 for greatest , condolencs for condolences , you instead of your , and colleagus for colleagues			0
all pms write to the next - of - kin of fallen troops but mr @entity48 ’s effort fuelled claims that he was being irreverent to @entity17 ’s forces			0
at the time , mrs @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s just disrespectful			1
