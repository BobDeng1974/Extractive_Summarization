this sequence of never - before - seen photographs shows the challenger space shuttle disaster from a dramatic new perspective as it explodes over the @entity4 , killing all seven crew on board			1
they were uncovered by a @entity9 user who was sorting through the attic of his recently deceased grandmother nearly 30 years after the tragedy			1
@entity13 , who posted the photos , says they were given to his @entity17 - contractor grandfather by a co-worker and despite all efforts , he has n't found pictures from the same angle			1
' my grandfather worked for @entity17 as a contractor for years , ' writes @entity13			1
' so he got to see just about every launch			0
his friend was the one who took these shots			0
' he gave him a copy of the prints and somehow they got mixed in and forgot about for years until i found them the other day			2
' doomed from the start : @entity17 experts who witnessed the disaster saw things the untrained eye could not			2
the color and size of the smoke indicated there were serious problems just seconds after takeoff all too real : the extent of the tragedy became all too clear as the smoke plume grew ever large and then was seen to envelope @entity25 itself ( left ) horrifying : fuel tanks began to jet away in opposite directions spewing white vapor and leaving behind a startling pyrotechnic display all seven challenger crewmembers - @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 - perished in the disaster on january 28 , 1986			0
the launch had received particular attention because of the inclusion of @entity97 , the first member of the @entity108 , after she beat 11,000 candidates to the coveted role			0
the unique trip , where she planned to teach @entity32 students from space , gained the program much publicity particularly because mrs @entity97 had an immediate rapport with the media			0
but the excitement quickly turned to horror when the shuttle exploded about 10 miles in the air , leaving a trail debris falling back to earth			1
rest in peace : the seven astronauts who died onboard were @entity99 , @entity98 , @entity102 , @entity97 , @entity103 , @entity101 and @entity100 all was lost that january day as the shattered remains of the @entity25 plummeted into the @entity4 everything changed : the immense explosion was seared in the minds of a generation of @entity32 who would no longer see @entity17 and its once - inspiring @entity133 the same way again the cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle 's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks			1
the shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts , but it became known later that at least several of those on board survived the initial explosion			2
then - president @entity148 ordered a probe into the @entity25 catastrophe , where it was found that poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the accident			2
grounded : the smoke would soon settle , but it would be two years before the pioneers at @entity17 would again take to the skies in a @entity160 the crew of the space shuttle challenge from 1986			1
from left to right : @entity101 , @entity163 , @entity97 , @entity99 , @entity102 , @entity100 and @entity103 it resulted in a nearly three - year lapse in @entity17 's shuttle program , with the next shuttle , @entity167 , taking off on september 29 , 1988			1
@entity17 ended the shuttle program for good last year , retiring the remaining vessels and instead opting for multimillion - dollar rides on @entity173 @entity172 capsules to get @entity32 astronauts to the @entity175			1
private @entity32 companies hope to help fill the gap , beginning with space station cargo and then , hopefully , astronauts			0
in their honour : the @entity181 at @entity182 in @entity182 , @entity183 , in memory of the seven crew members who died in the 1986 disaster @entity25 was one of @entity17 's greatest successes - but also one of its darkest legacies			2
it was initially built between 1975 and 1978 to be a test vehicle , but was later converted into a fully fledged spacecraft			0
in its heyday , it completed nine milestone missions - from launching the first female astronaut into space to taking part in the first repair of a satellite by an astronaut			0
but it was also the vehicle that very nearly ended the space program when a probe into the 1986 disaster found that the shuttle was doomed before it had even taken off			1
@entity206 , a @entity17 contractor at rocket - builder @entity208 , warned in 1985 that seals on the booster rocket joints could fail in freezing temperatures			1
' the result would be a catastrophe of the highest order â€” loss of human life , ' he wrote in a memo			0
on the eve of the ill - fated flight , @entity206 and several colleagues reiterated their concerns and argued against launching because of predicted cold weather at the @entity224			0
but they were overruled by @entity208 managers , who gave @entity17 the green light			2
after the accident , @entity206 testified to a presidential commission investigating the challenger accident			0
the group determined that hot gases leaked through a joint in one of the booster rockets shortly after blastoff that ended with the explosion of the shuttle 's hydrogen fuel			1
@entity206 died in 2012 aged 73 .			0
