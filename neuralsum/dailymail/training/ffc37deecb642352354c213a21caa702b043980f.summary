@entity0 has announced he will tear up his contract with @entity2 and leave the club over the fall - out from his infamous ' quenelle ' goal celebration - but the @entity2 claim the striker has not informed them yet , labelling the @entity8 ' unprofessional '			1
@entity0 is on saturday due to begin a five - match ban imposed for making the gesture , which has anti-semitic links , after scoring against @entity12 on december 28			1
an independent regulatory commission accepted there was no intent by @entity0 to be anti-semitic			2
but confusion remains over @entity0 ’s future as @entity2 on friday evening claimed they had received no formal resignation from him or his advisors and criticised him for issuing the statement on social media			1
sacked : @entity0 had been supported by @entity2 after his ' quenelle ' gesture ( above ) but has now had his contract terminated fresh start : @entity0 revealed earlier in the day via @entity27 that he was terminating his contract friend : the gesture is linked to @entity0 's friend , the controversial @entity8 comedian @entity30 @entity0 's club opted not to appeal against the sanction , and after holding talks with his employers the former @entity36 striker wrote on @entity37 : ' i have taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with @entity2			1
' @entity0 claims he made the gesture in support of his friend @entity44 , a @entity8 comedian who has been convicted seven times of anti-semitic crimes			1
following the incident , @entity0 started all four of @entity2 's @entity49 games in january			1
but he has not featured since and is banned for the upcoming trips to @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 as well as home games against @entity55 and @entity56			0
over the course of three posts written in @entity8 on his official @entity37 account , @entity0 wrote : ' following talks between the club and me , propositions were made to me in order to reintegrate me into the squad under certain conditions that i can not accept			1
' wishing to retain my integrity , i have therefore taken the decision to free myself and put an end to the contract linking me with @entity2 to 2014 , with immediate effect			1
' harsher : the @entity72 argued for a more severe sanction than the five - match ban @entity75 : @entity77 futsal player @entity76 received a 10 match ban for the same gesture but @entity2 said in a statement that they had not heard from @entity0 regarding the termination of his contract			1
the club said : ' the club confirms it has been continuing discussions with @entity0 and his advisers as part of its own internal enquiry into the gesture he made after scoring against @entity12 on december 28			1
' following the conclusion of the @entity72 's enquiry into the same incident , the club had hoped to conclude its own investigations next week			0
' the club notes @entity0 's comments on @entity37 this evening [ friday ]			1
however , the club has received nothing formally regarding the termination of @entity0 's contract from either him or his advisers			1
' the club regards the release of such a statement on social media as highly unprofessional and will make a further statement when appropriate			0
' comparison : the panel looked at the @entity109 - @entity110 and @entity112 - @entity111 cases when coming to their decision @entity0 is only eligible for the @entity2 ' last five games of the season but the club are yet to confirm the former @entity120 star 's claims			1
on thursday the @entity72 decided against appealing against the length of @entity0 ’s five - match ban , issued by an independent commission for his anti-semitic gesture			1
@entity0 is understood to have also accepted the ruling which means his suspension now begins , starting with @entity2 ’s match at @entity51 on saturday			1
the @entity72 were considering an appeal to obtain an increase to the ban , which was the minimum that could be handed out based on the governing body ’s new rules overseeing offences of a racist nature			0
@entity2 ’s own investigation into the @entity8 ’s actions is still ongoing , with a conclusion expected next week			1
the club had not ruled out sacking the player for his quenelle gesture			0
