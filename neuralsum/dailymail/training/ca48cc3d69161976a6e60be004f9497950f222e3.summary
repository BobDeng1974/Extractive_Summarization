@entity1 's @entity0 delivers his verdict on a weekend of shocks in the @entity4			2
first , @entity5 were humbled at @entity6 , losing 3 - 1 to @entity7 to make it three defeats in five this season			1
and on sunday , @entity11 were soundly beaten by @entity12 5 - 3 giving @entity13 much to ponder			1
there was also the small matter of a @entity18 goal against @entity19 for @entity20 in a 1 - 1 draw			1
how @entity22 has to prove his genius it does n’t take a great tactical mind to go out and sign @entity26 and @entity27			1
any @entity11 fan could have done that			1
it ’s not rocket science			2
but fixing the @entity11 defence is another matter			1
now we really will find out if @entity13 is a genius			1
everyone could see that @entity11 were light years away from where they should be			1
they were so obviously short of top defenders and have given themselves a major problem by not signing a recognised centre back			2
they had no @entity42 in the week and plenty of time to work on their defensive system			2
there were no excuses and to concede five goals against a newly promoted club is appalling			1
now we will really find out if @entity13 is a genius ... the @entity11 boss must work on his system @entity22 is well stocked up front but he seriously needs to address the issues in defence @entity11 were defeated 5 - 3 by @entity12 on saturday at the @entity58 at the beginning of the season , people criticised them for using a back three but even with four they let in five goals			1
can you imagine if that had happened with a three ? it just goes to show there is more to their problems than just systems			2
but for all of @entity11 ’s woes , all credit to @entity12			1
they were magnificent again and have tested some of the best teams			2
their fans will be loving the start they have made back in the @entity4			2
@entity12 were magnificent , they have tested the best teams in the league and the fans should be proud goal would have left @entity82 do n't be fooled by the non-celebration			1
@entity18 will have been the happiest man in the dressing room after scoring that goal			1
he is the ultimate goalscoring machine and if he did n’t want to score , what was he doing in the box ? he has perfected the art of arriving late in the area and makes it look so easy			0
he ’s like a magnet to the ball but that ’s not down to luck — he has spent a lifetime practising			0
do n't be fooled by @entity18 's celebration , he would have been the happiest player on the pitch ! @entity18 claps the @entity19 support , but if he did n't want to score , why was he in the box ? @entity101 got the blame for not tracking @entity103 but @entity104 should have known better than to let @entity18 get in behind him			1
@entity18 is the greatest goalscoring midfielder we have ever seen in the @entity4 and maybe even the best in the world			1
he will not have cared one bit about scoring against his old club			2
he is a true professional and the ultimate winner			0
@entity18 embraces @entity110 at the end of the match - city and @entity19 drew 1 - 1 at the @entity113 set - piece shocker @entity5 let in two @entity4 goals in the first 10 minutes for the first time since february 1994 , when @entity117 beat them 4 - 2			1
below : record since the start of last season without @entity122 , @entity5 were never going to score as many goals			1
the worrying thing for @entity125 is his side are still letting them in at an alarming rate			0
they ’ve let in 35 league goals and kept six clean sheets in 2014			2
that ’s not good enough			0
opposition teams are sensing the fear and set - pieces in particular are now a phobia for @entity125 ’ men			1
that is something you would expect to be fixed on the training ground , but you can overdo it			0
if you focus too much on weaknesses you can become very conscious of them and start to think more about what you ca n’t do than what you can			0
the @entity5 defence look gripped by fear at every corner and free - kick			1
since the start of last season they have let in more goals from set - pieces than @entity12 or @entity19			1
@entity5 have conceded 16 goals from set - pieces since the start of last season @entity125 ' side have actually looked worse in defence since @entity122 's departure @entity12 's new beast @entity20 already have one beast in central defence with @entity163			1
now with @entity164 , they ’ve found another one			1
he was magnificent on debut and there ’s no bigger test at present than facing @entity169			0
but @entity164 was strong , aggressive and fantastic on the ball			1
between him and @entity163 , @entity12 could have a formidable partnership			0
@entity20 have another new beast on their hands other than @entity163 : @entity164 this grappling is holding us back @entity176 has become so obsessed with trying to stop diving — correctly , i might add — that we have ignored another disease in our game : grappling at set - pieces			1
it has been brushed over for years but it ’s just as big a problem as diving			0
every week we see players holding on to the opposition for dear life at corners and free - kicks			2
we seem to be losing the art of defending properly and fairly			2
if it ’s outside the area , it ’s a free - kick			2
if it ’s in the box , it ’s a penalty			0
until referees are strong enough to act , it will not go away			0
it ’s killing our game but if more penalties were awarded , then players would think twice before doing it again			0
@entity202 sticks to the brief when @entity7 kept @entity202 , he knew he had to produce attacking football if he wanted to stay in the job			0
now he ’s doing that in abundance			0
@entity7 have better players this season and have pace throughout the team			0
if they keep it up they will lose the fear factor they had last season of playing at home			0
@entity202 's attacking football with @entity7 could mean the fans actually end up liking him they deserved their win and it was a tactical masterstroke to play @entity220 at the tip of the diamond			0
he was magnificent all evening			0
if @entity202 ’s not careful , the @entity7 fans might end up liking him			0
@entity226 delight what a performance from @entity228			1
the lad is just 18 but he grabbed a hat - trick as @entity231 thrashed @entity232 6 - 1			1
it takes a good player to score three goals from midfield , whatever level you are playing at , and @entity239 looks the real deal			1
he was fantastic when his side demolished @entity11 in the @entity242 and was at it again on saturday			1
sometimes a young player is better off playing regularly at a lower level			2
going through the youth teams at a top club is great but there are so few opportunities for first - team football			2
i was 16 when i played for @entity252 before @entity253 signed me for @entity5 and that early experience helped			1
it ’s good to see @entity239 starting his career in a similar way			0
@entity228 was superb again for @entity231 on saturday , the young midfielder has a bright future @entity262 's bonus @entity263 is proving to be a good bit of business for @entity266			1
he scored on his debut against his old club @entity7 a week ago and hit an absolute screamer against @entity270			0
@entity262 has made some good signings during his time at the club and his new midfielder is big , strong and powers his way through games			0
he ’s shown he ’s got great technique , too , and at £ 3.5million he looks a snip			0
@entity263 could be a bargain for @entity262 and @entity266 at just £ 3.5m , he scored a screamer on saturday @entity282 's @entity283 3 @entity284 must enjoy proving a point against his old clubs			2
the striker scored one and set up another against @entity289 , where he played for a season in 2000 - 01			1
that means that the last three times he has scored a goal and assisted another in the same game have all come against former clubs			0
@entity289 were the latest victims and he has done it twice against @entity301			0
814 @entity302 completed more passes against @entity301 than in any @entity4 game since 2012 , when they made 828 against @entity305			0
2010 @entity306 have failed to score in straight home games for the first time since august 2010			0
not what fans hoped @entity310 would add to the team			0
100 % @entity312 clearly took their shooting boots with them when they went to @entity314			0
@entity316 ’s team only had three shots on target in the entire match but scored with each one			0
10 @entity321 beat @entity306 for the first time in 10 league matches			0
they also ended a run of nine league games without a win at @entity328 , their last coming in 1984			0
the last three times @entity284 has scored assisted in the same game have all come against former clubs 2009 @entity334 's poor form in front of goal means they are the first side to draw three @entity4 games in a row 0 - 0 since @entity340 drew three blanks in december 2009			1
16,171 @entity342 in @entity343 drew more than 16,000 fans to @entity345 for their 1 - 1 draw with @entity347			2
that ’s eight more people than watched @entity289 draw 2 - 2 with @entity350 at @entity351 in the @entity4 .			2

@entity11 were defensively poor in their 5 - 3 defeat @entity353
now we *'ll* really find out if @entity13 is a genius ...
@entity18 will have been the happiest player on the pitch on sunday
do n't be fooled , he loves scoring all goals , even against @entity19
@entity5 must sort their defending from set - pieces if they are to improve
@entity20 have found a new beast in defender @entity164
@entity231 *youngster* @entity228 could be a star of the future
