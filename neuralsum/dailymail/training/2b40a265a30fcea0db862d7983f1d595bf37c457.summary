click here to read who @entity2 @entity1 and @entity3 think will win the two - horse title race between @entity6 and @entity7 for once , the sound of team - mates lavishing praise on a colleague was not laden with toe - curling cliches			1
it is the norm for players , when pressed on the merits of a comrade , to trot out well - worn words which , ultimately , hold no substance whatsoever			0
but as @entity20 and @entity21 stood outside the dressing - rooms at the @entity23 , there was relief and appreciation that the subject of their post-match reflection was in their team			1
@entity31 had been awesome and @entity20 made it plain how much the striker is valued			1
@entity31 's opening strike at @entity35 was among the best of his goals so far this season the reigning champions have closed the gap on @entity7 at the top of the table to six points the @entity44 forward is almost single - handedly responsible for @entity6 's recent resurgence ‘ everything he does right now looks so quick , sharp and clinical , ’ said the defender			1
‘ he is working really hard for the team off the ball and that is also something you have to appreciate from @entity31 , because the strikers normally want to play only with the ball			1
‘ he is probably the best striker in the world at the moment			2
we are very lucky to have @entity31 in the team			1
’ a hundred yards along the corridor , @entity6 manager @entity59 was echoing their salute , likewise @entity35 boss @entity63			2
@entity31 won warm applause on a cold night from the home fans when , after two goals and an assist during wednesday ’s 4 - 1 victory , he was substituted late on			1
four days earlier , those same supporters had jeered @entity7 ’s @entity70 after he was shackled by @entity35 ’s backline during a goalless draw			2
@entity31 's brace this season has taken his league tally to 14 goals - top of the @entity78 scoring charts @entity80 team - mate @entity20 's only regret is that @entity31 was not fit and fully firing at the @entity81 but they , like their striker @entity82 who mouthed ‘ @entity85 ’ following @entity31 ’s stunning equaliser , were in awe of the @entity6 marksman			1
@entity20 is already a two - time @entity78 champion , in large part thanks to @entity31			1
but he could have been a @entity81 winner had his @entity44 compatriot not been troubled by a loss of form and fitness in @entity95			0
‘ of course you think what might have been in the @entity81 if he ’d been fit , ’ said @entity20 , who was part of the team beaten in the final by @entity99			2
‘ but i have known him for a long time and this is probably the best moment of his whole career			0
’ it is little wonder @entity21 was queuing up to join the appreciation society , for he had profited from @entity31 ’s brilliance to net his fourth goal of the season			1
@entity21 points to @entity31 after the free - scoring @entity44 set up his goal against @entity35 @entity21 believes @entity31 is behind only @entity115 and @entity116 ( right ) as the world 's best players given their proximity on the pitch , the @entity119 is well placed to offer assessment of his 26 - year - old strike partner			1
‘ he is the best player i have played with — he and @entity129 , ’ said @entity21 , referencing the @entity126 playmaker who could return from a knee injury against @entity128 tomorrow			0
‘ but @entity31 can score some goals ! he is great			2
he does it every game , and for me it is @entity115 and @entity116 and then him — one of the best players in the world			1
‘ i liked the first goal because when he stopped the ball it was going away from him , and in the last second he did a nutmeg , and scored			0
‘ then his assist for me was great as well			0
he is on fire , and if he is like this we can do big things			0
’ @entity59 will be hoping his side can take advantage of a friendly set of festive fixtures this , though , is not simply the @entity31 show			2
@entity20 , @entity151 and @entity152 were all outstanding in midweek			0
and that is why — especially given the kindness of their fixtures amid the festive frenzy — it is they who could be top of the tree when the time arrives to take down the decorations ; @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 — four of the bottom six — could well represent the 12 points of @entity169 for @entity59 ’s men			0
with @entity129 and @entity172 set to return and the positive prognosis on @entity175 ’s hamstring meaning he could be back at @entity164 next weekend , it is looking like a winter of content for a team who have now won four on the spin			0
@entity31 is on the scoresheet and his pals are giving praise from the same songsheet			0
suddenly , everything is in tune at the @entity187 .			0

@entity31 leads the @entity78 scoring charts with 14 goals
@entity20 believes his team - mate is the ' best striker in the world now '
@entity21 *insists* only @entity115 and @entity116 compare
@entity6 are looking to close the gap on @entity7 during festive run
