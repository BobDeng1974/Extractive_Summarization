patrol : nearly 7,500 phones were seized in prisons in @entity3 and @entity4 in 2013 mobile phones being used by prisoners will be cut off under tough new laws			1
operators will be forced to block any number traced to an inmate following a number of cases where offenders have stalked victims and witnesses on social media and boasted about their cushy time behind bars			0
prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings			1
use of a mobile phone behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine , but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside			1
the most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in @entity3 and @entity4 in 2013			1
since 2012 prison governors have had the power to interfere with mobile phone signals to thwart crime bosses operating there by phone			1
however the @entity42 estimates it would cost £ 300million to install the devices at every prison , with operating costs of £ 800,000 a year			0
but under the proposed new legislation to be debated in the @entity48 today , once a prisoner ’s phone signal has been identified , the @entity46 will be able to apply to a court for it to be disconnected without guards having to find the device itself			2
a memo written by @entity56 , the home secretary , leaked to @entity57 , says : ‘ there are over 7,000 known organised criminals in prison in @entity3 and @entity4			1
' we know of cases of serious crimes including large drug imports , escapes and murders being organised from prison , enabled by illicit mobile phones			1
‘ the mobile network operators have told us they are unwilling to disconnect these phones unless compelled by law			2
’ ministers estimate the cost of blocking illicit phones and @entity75 will be up to £ 300,000 , with the cost to the mobile firms of up to £ 212,000			2
it will not be necessary to seize the phone or prove that it is being used by a specific prisoner , speeding up the enforcement of the ban on using mobiles behind bars			2
under the plans , prison security chiefs would use new but cheaper technology to detect the use of phones and their numbers			2
prisons already use a range of measures to detect items of contraband with intelligence - led searches , body searches and the use of x-ray machines , metal detectors and cctv surveillance cameras , as well as body orifice scanners			0
smuggled in : prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings ( stock image ) but now they will be able to go to a county court with all the numbers from each prison and young offenders ' institution and obtain a blacklisting order from the court			1
there would be no need for prison officers to find and seize the phones from prisoners who have sophisticated means of concealing their use			1
ministers will table an amendment to the @entity125 to introduce the measure when it is discussed in @entity127 tomorrow			0
it follows dozens of cases where inmates have used their smartphones to upload messages and pictures from inside their cells showing their cushy prison lifestyle with access to tvs , gaming consoles and junk food			0
in november last year a thug serving a 10 - year sentence for stabbing his sister 's ex-boyfriend and leaving him for dead boasted about his ‘ f * * * * * * blinding ’ time behind bars			0
@entity147 , 27 , from @entity148 , @entity149 , was stabbed in the face and beaten so badly that his mother did n’t even recognise him in hospital			0
but his attacker @entity153 continued to torment his victim from his prison cell , bragging on @entity156 that it was ‘ all worth it ’			0
yesterday @entity158 , the prisons minister , said : ‘ we will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons			1
this proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem			0
‘ by ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified , we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before			0

use of a mobile can land a prisoner with an *additional* two years in jail
