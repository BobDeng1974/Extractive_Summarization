@entity0 is rugby ’s equivalent of ‘ the beard to be feared ’ and on saturday , when the bewhiskered @entity4 lock faces @entity5 , his former home country , he will be hoping to do damage at the @entity7			1
it is not just the facial hair that allows 23 - year - old ball to share a nickname with @entity13 , the @entity15 cricket all - rounder			1
the @entity17 forward also has an impressive cricketing pedigree			1
at the age of 18 he was considered to be one of @entity5 ’s brightest prospects and was offered a place at @entity25 ’s @entity24			1
@entity26 to the assembled media on wednesday ahead of @entity29 ' autumn opener against @entity5 born in @entity30 , @entity0 emigrated from @entity31 to @entity32 with his family in 2006			1
it seemed that any hopes of a rugby career had been forgone to pursue a livelihood in test cricket			2
he was mentored by former test cricketer @entity40 but got cold feet when a professional contract was put on the table			2
‘ i was a slinger so i was quite an unusual style , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ at 17 i clocked around 82mph			2
i played with the @entity40 boys ( @entity47 and @entity48 ) and i do miss the bowling but i hated standing in the field			2
‘ i was a tail - end batsman so i spent quite a lot of time sitting around			2
i realised i did n’t want to go down that path in the end			2
i ’d had enough of cricket and missed my rugby so i went back and played some club games			0
‘ it ’s probably the aggressive side of the game ( that rugby offers over cricket )			0
i was a bit over the top when playing cricket — i did n’t like getting nicked over the slips and all of that			0
i tried to keep my cool			0
@entity68 ? no , i was more of a quiet angry man			0
’ @entity15 cricket @entity13 is another possessor of a famed sporting beard ball used to play cricket with @entity77 international @entity75 ( above ) and his brother @entity48 @entity79 subsequently picked him up but then released him because he did not meet the standards			1
a second opportunity arose with the @entity83 franchise where @entity0 eventually played alongside current @entity5 internationals including @entity85 and @entity86			1
that opened the door to a return to @entity91 and , in 2012 , the 6ft 6in and 19st 1lb giant agreed a three - year deal with the @entity17 in @entity29 , where his father grew up in @entity94			1
ball ’s physicality suited the style of play in the northern hemisphere and the abrasive battle between the forwards			2
‘ i think i preferred it because it ’s a lot more close - quarters in @entity91 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it ’s more pick and go through the breakdown			0
i love the breakdown side of the game and i think the game suited me massively			0
’ ball takes on @entity15 lock @entity112 at @entity113 during this year 's @entity114 @entity29 coach @entity115 rewarded @entity0 ’s club performances with an international call - up for the 2014 @entity114			1
ball made his international debut off the bench against @entity121 and then broke into the starting xv when @entity122 and @entity123 were injured			2
ball has been named alongside @entity125 in saturday ’s line - up , having risen up the pecking order and earned the confidence of the selectors			1
‘ to be selected without someone going down injured is big for me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i got my two starts in the @entity114 when @entity132 and @entity133 went down so to get picked was a goal of mine			0
’ @entity125 and @entity0 will be the engine room in a physical set of @entity4 forwards in @entity139			1
they will be tasked with attacking @entity5 up front to try to force a dangerous @entity5 back - line to play on the back foot			1
@entity29 must also raise the pace to keep up with the tempo set by their visitors			1
attack coach @entity148 says gps tracking systems show a @entity4 player in an average club game covers 55 metres per minute			0
an @entity77 will cover nearly 50 per cent more ground at 75 - 80m a minute			0
@entity0 rises to collect a high ball against @entity154 during the @entity114 to combat that , @entity115 has been turning up the heat in training to ensure his players are at their physical peak			1
there have been 6.30am wake - up calls and up to three sessions of cryotherapy a day			0
‘ it ’s been a pretty brutal couple of weeks , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we ’ll gain the benefits from that in the game			0
i ’d say it ’s as tough as anything i ’ve done			0
we ’ve been up early and in the altitude chamber , which is n’t my favourite place			0
‘ i think running fitness has been something i ’ve spent a fair bit of work on			0
when i first came into camp , the running side of things — some of the tests — were very different for me			0
i ’d never really done that before so now i ’m starting to get my foothold there			0
’ it will be fast and frantic this weekend ; the days of standing around in the field will seem like a very long time ago .			0

@entity0 born in @entity15 and moved to @entity5 in 2006
@entity0 moved to @entity29 to join @entity17 in 2012 and *qualifies* through his dad
ball will start against @entity5 at the @entity7 on saturday
