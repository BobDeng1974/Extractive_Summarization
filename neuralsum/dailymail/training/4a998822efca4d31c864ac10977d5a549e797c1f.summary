once @entity1 conquers a human cell , it will stay there forever			0
it inserts its deadly genome permanently into its victims ' dna , forcing them to require medical treatment for the rest of their life			2
but now , for the first time , researchers in @entity13 have found a way to completely delete @entity1 from human cells by ‘ snipping ’ them out			2
the process could also provide a cure for other latent infections the team of @entity26 said the breakthrough marks the first successful attempt to eliminate latent hiv - 1 virus from human cells – and could be a cure for other latent infections			1
‘ this is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for @entity36 , ' said @entity37 , phd , professor and chair of the @entity40 at @entity26			2
' it 's an exciting discovery , but it 's not yet ready to go into the clinic			1
it 's a proof of concept that we 're moving in the right direction , ' he added , in a study published by the @entity49 , dr @entity37 and colleagues detail how they created molecular tools to delete the @entity1 - 1 proviral dna			1
researchers based the two - part @entity1 - 1 editor on a system that evolved as a bacterial defence mechanism to protect against infection			2
when deployed , a combination of a dna - snipping enzyme called a nuclease and a targeting strand of @entity62 called a guide @entity62 ( @entity65 ) hunt down the viral genome and remove the @entity1 - 1 dna			1
dr @entity37 's lab engineered a 20 - nucleotide strand of @entity65 to target the @entity1 - 1 dna and paired it with a dna - sniping enzyme called @entity71 and used to edit the human genome			1
from there , the cell 's gene repair machinery takes over , soldering the loose ends of the genome back together – resulting in virus - free cells			1

' since hiv - 1 is never cleared by the immune system , removal of the virus is required in order to cure the disease , ' explained dr @entity37			1
these molecular tools also hold promise as a therapeutic vaccine ; cells armed with the nuclease - @entity62 combination proved impervious to hiv infection			0
worldwide , more than 33 million people have @entity1 , including more than 1 million in the @entity100			0
every year , another 50,000 @entity100 contract the virus , according to the @entity102			0
in the @entity104 , around 100,000 people were living with @entity1 in the @entity104 in 2013			0
that ’s around one person in 665			0
although highly active antiretroviral therapy ( @entity109 ) has controlled @entity1 - 1 for infected people in the developed world over the last 15 years , the virus can rage again with any interruption in treatment			0

‘ this is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for @entity36 , ' said @entity37 , phd , professor and chair of the @entity40 at @entity26 ' the low level replication of @entity1 - 1 makes patients more likely to suffer from diseases usually associated with ageing , ' dr @entity37 said			1
these include cardiomyopathy – a weakening of the heart muscle – bone disease , kidney disease , and neurocognitive disorders			0
' these problems are often exacerbated by the toxic drugs that must be taken to control the virus , ' dr @entity37 added			2

dr @entity37 's lab engineered a 20 - nucleotide strand of @entity65 to target the @entity1 - 1 dna and paired it with a dna - sniping enzyme called @entity71 and used to edit the human genome			1
' we are working on a number of strategies so we can take the construct into preclinical studies , ' dr @entity37 said			2
' we want to eradicate every single copy of @entity1 - 1 from the patient			0
i think this technology is the way we can do it			0

*scientists* used a dna - snipping enzyme called @entity71 to cut out the virus
the cell 's gene repair machinery then takes over , soldering the loose ends of the genome back together – resulting in a virus - free cell
process could also be a cure for other latent infections , researchers say
' it 's an exciting discovery , but not ready to go into the clinic , ' said dr @entity37
