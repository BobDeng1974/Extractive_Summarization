by @entity0 @entity1 has been forced to remove @entity3 labelling from bouquets after it emerged many of its flowers come from abroad			1
the firm had said that half of the blooms in its £ 195 @entity11 ’s day gift were @entity3 - grown – a claim that checks showed to be false			1
experts found that the red chrysanthemums in the bouquet are not even available in @entity3 at this time of year			1
' @entity3 grown ' : @entity1 's claims about having flowers grown in the @entity3 were proven to be false			1
here is where they really come from when a dozen independent @entity1 florists nationwide were called at random , half admitted that all their flowers came from @entity26 and some came from as far as @entity27			1
red tulips and ivy were the only @entity3 - grown of the ten varieties of flower in the bouquet – and only a quarter of the florists had either in stock			2
industry experts say that @entity3 - grown red chrysanthemums are not available anywhere in the @entity3 at this time of year and it is highly unlikely anywhere will be growing white hyacinths or myrtle commercially either			1
embarrassingly , @entity1 have now caved in to demands that it ditch its controversial ‘ @entity3 grown ’ icons and have admitted that it ‘ can not guarantee ’ the source of its flowers			1
even one of the country ’s biggest wholesalers which specialises in @entity3 - grown flowers , @entity51 of @entity53 ’s @entity52 , had only the red tulips from this country			1
@entity1 accepts that the remaining five flowers in its bouquets - red and pink roses , lilac , agapanthus and amaranth - are all imported			0
' out of our control ' : @entity1 said they can not guarantee where each store gets their flowers from @entity68 , a campaigner for the @entity3 flower industry , estimates that the bouquet ’s flowers have covered up to 188,447 air miles			1
she said : ‘ @entity1 ’s florists are having a difficult time making ends meet			0
‘ if it is left to them whether to buy cheap imported flowers or more expensive @entity3 flowers , naturally they will buy the cheaper ones			1
‘ @entity1 has really shot themselves in the foot by claiming their flowers are @entity3 - grown			1
‘ the few chrysanthemum growers left in @entity3 do not use heat and you need that to grow them at this time of year			2
‘ we say it is not very likely the flowers in their bouquets will be @entity3 - grown and the fact they have retracted their icons means they can not justify their claims			1
she added : ‘ the @entity98 are the main @entity3 gardening organisation and they should be promoting @entity3 growers and not endorsing a product that is predominantly imported			2
‘ right now , @entity3 growers have superb tulips grown in @entity103 , stunning anemones and gloriously scented narcissi from @entity106 and the @entity107			2
‘ to see the @entity98 then championing scentless flowers mass - produced in @entity109 is soul - destroying			0
’ @entity110 , author of @entity111 , said : ‘ it ’s disappointing the @entity98 did n’t take the opportunity to promote @entity3 flowers			2
‘ just as we ’ve done with food , we need to be looking at sourcing locally - grown flowers and growing our own			0
‘ apart from the environmental cost , imported blooms mean we have lost touch with the seasons			0
’ according to the @entity98 and @entity1 , the bouquet ’s flowers “ encapsulate the meaning of love in all its forms ’			0
@entity1 ’s expert florist @entity127 , who created the bouquet , said : ‘ whether it ’s the deep velvety reds of the @entity131 roses or the sweet smelling lilac , all the elements come together to portray a symphony of affection			0
’ an @entity1 spokeswoman said yesterday : ‘ we have got 1,800 independent florists and they all source their own stock			0
‘ there is a certain percentage of the stems that can be sourced as @entity3 - grown but it is out of our control where each individual florist gets their stems from			2
‘ we can not guarantee that every one of those florists is going to source @entity3 - grown stems			0
‘ to avoid being misleading in any way , we decided we would take the ‘ @entity3 - grown ’ icons off			0
’ a percentage of all proceeds from @entity1 ’s bouquets is going towards @entity98 charitable activities			0
an @entity98 spokesman said that is ‘ extremely committed to supporting @entity3 horticulture			0

@entity157 forced to remove @entity3 labelling after it was found to be false
checks by experts found some flowers not even available in @entity3
some stores contacted admitted importing from @entity26 and @entity27
