the brute shot eight - year - old @entity10 with an air rifle from a range of up to 50 feet while he was hunting field mice in farmland near his home in @entity16			1
despite his wounds , the whimpering moggie managed to limp back home and was later found covered with blood in his owner ’s back garden			2
injured : @entity10 the cat ( pictured ) had to have his front left leg amputated after he was shot with an air rifle while out hunting			1
his owner @entity29 ( pictured , right ) has slammed the heartless thug who injured her beloved pet disabled : @entity10 ( left ) is still learning to hobble around on three legs following the amputation			1
an x-ray ( right ) shows the damage done to the bone in the cat 's leg by the air rifle pellet @entity41 revealed a pellet from the rifle had shattered a bone in @entity10 ’s front left leg and , despite the intervention of a vet , the leg could not be saved and the animal had to have 14 stitches			1
today @entity10 ’s owner @entity29 , 26 , of @entity52 , near @entity53 , @entity16 , said she was ' heartbroken for him			1
' ' @entity10 is such an active little thing and this is going to diminish what he ’s able to do , ' she said			1
' it was just so shocking to see @entity10 like that			1
' everyone who has seen him has burst into tears			0
' it ’s such a tragedy he had to go through this and i ’m angry that someone ’s been so callous and cruel to do this to him			0
violence : miss @entity29 said that whoever shot her pet is ' callous and cruel ' ' whoever has done it can have no education about how to use that kind of weapon			2
' possibly they have done [ this ] for some kind of sick thrill			0
' this person who did this is probably the type who play on video games and when they shoot things the targets get back up			1
they do n’t realise that in real life it ’s very different			0
' the incident is believed to have occurred on september 6 after @entity10 went out roaming in the neighbourhood			1
he failed to return that evening and the truth emerged the following morning , when he was found hurt in miss @entity29 's garden			0
at first she thought @entity10 had been hit by a car			1
' i scooped him up and noticed his leg was really rigid , ' she said			2
' i rushed him to the vet and they found a big hole in the leg			2
' the vet did everything he could but there was nothing he could do about @entity10 ’s leg			1
' he ’s recovering at home now but is very groggy			2
' he seems to be adapting to it well though			0
he ’s wobbling around on his three legs			0
' he ’s a very good - natured thing , very happy and enjoying cuddles from everyone			0
' but miss @entity29 said that every time she opens the door for the other cats @entity10 wobbles over and sits by the door mournfully because he can not go out too			1
' i think he was shot in a local field and he managed to hobble home			2
the injury is quite horrific			0
from the wound it looks like he was shot from about 50 feet away			2
' he ’s a big white fluffy thing			0
i ca n’t comprehend the mentality where someone would want to shoot a cat			0
' miss @entity29 's mother @entity125 , 59 , a child care worker , said it is upsetting to watch @entity10 try to negotiate the stairs on his three remaining legs			2
games : the @entity130 have put some of the blame for the incident on the growing popularity of violent video games amongst young people			1
the injury has badly affected @entity10 's mobility ' the worse thing is that we have spoken to a gun club who said that @entity10 was shot from 50 feet away so they would have known exactly what they were doing , ' she said			1
' i ca n’t think of anybody that could be this heartless			0
the law on air rifles is ridiculous			2
' i never realised , but if they are misused then the law is the same as if you are using a real gun			0
' however they are bringing the age down to be able to use them to 15 which is ridiculous			0
people do n’t realise how dangerous they can be			0
' mrs @entity29 placed some of the blame on the growing popularity of violent computer games among the young			1
' the first thing you learn with guns is to never point it at anything living , ' she said			0
' they are all acting it out in their [ computer ] games but they have never seen the result of what guns can do			2
' @entity10 is lucky that he managed to get home , otherwise he would have bled to death			1
' these thugs do n’t think of anybody else but themselves			0
' sgt @entity180 of @entity181 said : ' we will not tolerate animal cruelty of any kind			0
' we will be investigating this matter , and appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to come forward			0
' shooting : @entity10 was shot near his home in @entity52 , in rural @entity16 ( pictured on map )			1
