what do you get when you have arguably the world 's greatest - ever player , playing the current no 1 football game on the planet ? well in truth , not the spectacle that one would hope for			2
three - time @entity11 winner @entity9 took on his former @entity13 and @entity14 team - mate @entity12 at a game of @entity16 15 on an @entity18 recently - in an affair that would likely feature last on @entity19 if it was played out in reality			1
the match was n't a tight affair though for it 's skill , but more due to a lack of it as the two 70 - somethings were unfamiliar with the game , or the console that they played it on , unsurprisingly			2
rather comically the pair seem confused as to what the controls were - but take it in all good heart as they laugh at their own misgivings			0
and once more - like throughout his glittering career - @entity9 proved the matchwinner scoring the only goal to separate the two sides ; as @entity13 faced @entity13 in a special clash that featured the duo featuring virtually with their team - mates from their formidable team in the 1950s and 60s			1
despite their struggles to get to grips with the game the pair were all smiles as they played @entity16 15 @entity9 ( left ) showed he 's gracious in defeat by shaking the hand of @entity12 after the full - time whistle ironically though , it was the real - life @entity9 who tasted some of his own goalscoring medicine for once , with @entity12 controlling his virtual version to score and win the game 1 - 0			1
seeing the iconic @entity14 no 10 in a jovial manner though will please everyone in the football world after the 74 - year - old recently was recently discharged from hospital on tuesday			2

@entity9 was released from hospital on tuesday after recovering form a urinary tract infection @entity9 gave a press conference after being released from hospital , after which he left in a wheelchair ' thank @entity102 i 'm well and recovered			1
i want to thank everyone who sent messages - i 've been thrilled and surprised			0
' i 've had messages from @entity107 , @entity108 , from almost all the @entity110 countries			0
' it is gratifying and good to know that i had the support of so many people around the world who were hoping the situation improved			0
' now i am preparing for the @entity95 ! ' @entity9 was in hospital for 16 days but says he is now focusing on the @entity95			0
