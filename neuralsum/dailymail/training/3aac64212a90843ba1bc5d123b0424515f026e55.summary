by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:15 est , 16 january 2013 in what was described as a victory against art ' snobbery ' , 80 pieces of his work - including eight rarely unseen landscapes - will be displayed at the @entity8 in june			1
@entity9 is loved for his ‘ matchstick men ’ depictions of everyday life in @entity12 in the first half of 20th - century @entity8			1
but a major retrospective of his work has not been shown in the capital since his death in 1976			0
@entity9 's @entity19 is a typical example of the artist 's depictions of everyday life in the north of @entity25 his art has previously been dismissed as the work of a ‘ sunday painter ’ by high - brow critics , with some saying he could ‘ barely paint ’			1
the @entity30 holds 23 @entity9 pieces - 16 paper drawings are readily available to visitors but only one painting , @entity35 ( 1955 ) , has been on display in @entity37 in the past 20 years			1
the gallery has previously been criticised by actor sir @entity39 and @entity41 star @entity40 for being biased against the @entity43 - born artist			1
sir @entity39 told a 2011 documentary it was ‘ a shame , verging on the iniquitous , that foreign visitors to @entity37 should n’t have access to the painter @entity51 people like more than most others ’			0
in the same film , artist dame @entity53 described reaction to him as ‘ a great snobbery ’			2
yesterday art historians @entity57 and @entity59 , who worked on the exhibition , said it was time to ‘ reassess ’ @entity9 ’s place in @entity64 art. mr @entity57 said : ‘ it is absolutely extraordinary to me that the image of him as an amateur , as truly someone who could barely paint , just wo n’t die			0
‘ coded into that is a deep conviction of the metropolitan elite that someone who spends their life painting that subject matter ca n’t be taken seriously			0
’ @entity8 director @entity77 said the exhibition would be ‘ serious , authentic and not cynical ’ and @entity9 needed to be ‘ reconciled to art history ’			0
sir @entity39 would be invited to the opening , she added			0
