by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 02:58 est , 11 march 2013 even his most ardent fans may have blinked and missed it			2
but @entity4 yesterday published all the lyrics to his first album for ten years – in a newspaper advert			1
typeset as four finely printed columns of text with his name at the end , the full - page advert in the @entity9 marks the final bit of publicity ahead of tomorrow ’s release of @entity18			0
@entity4 , 66 , has also been publishing the lyrics on his @entity21 page and on @entity22			1
@entity4 pictured with @entity23 in the video of his new song @entity26 ) but critics said that many would have flicked past the newspaper page without realising it actually contained all 17 new songs , which have titles such as @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 )			1
@entity4 's ad contained the lyrics of his songs including from his 1973 album @entity39 @entity40 , a pop expert who has written extensively on @entity4 , said : ‘ it ’s very avant garde			1
it ’s an advert , but with no reference to what the advert is about			0
‘ having no line breaks also makes it more difficult to read			0
’ some lyrics focus on the reclusive star ’s stay in @entity53 from 1976 to 1979			2
there are also references to the writer @entity56 , the @entity57 poet @entity56 , and the @entity60 folk singers @entity58 and @entity61			0
@entity4 officially announced the release of his album on his website on friday			1
he even gave an explanation for his long hiatus from the music world			0
an official statement read : ‘ in recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation , rumour and wishful thinking			0
. a new record ... who would have ever thought it , who ’d have ever dreamed of it ? ‘ after all @entity4 is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants ... when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell			1
‘ today , he definitely has something to say			0
’ @entity84 is author of when @entity85 : @entity4 and four minutes that shook @entity88 the response to @entity4 ’s new album , @entity18 , has been one of unshackled euphoria			1
grown men who have witnessed a dozen @entity4 ‘ comebacks ’ ( i remember three in 1974 alone ) have been treating the record as though it has some sort of magical , transformative powers , preferring to ignore the fact his last two records – @entity101 , in 2002 , and 2003 ’s reality – were equally as good			1
their enthusiasm is an expression of relief as much as anything – relief that someone we have all invested so much emotional energy in over the years can still deliver ‘ the goods ’			0
what is truly remarkable is yet more proof of @entity4 ’s ( pretty much ) innate ability to place himself in exactly the right place in any contemporary pop cultural matrix			1
for instance , the videos for @entity120 ) – unequivocally the two best songs on the record , reminding you that @entity4 still has an acute commercial sense – are not just smart , inventive and oddly self - deprecating , they ’re also perfect examples of @entity4 ’s ability to wind narrative around him in a totally age - appropriate way			1
many of the reviews of @entity18 have indicated that this record breaks new ground for @entity4 , which on occasion it does			1
@entity4 ’s own particular creative charabanc may have more wheels on it than practically anyone else ’s in the music industry , but he has n’t reinvented it			1
a wheel is still a wheel no matter how many times you turn it			0
consequently , you can hear echoes from many of his previous records on @entity18 , everything from @entity148 ( and in particular the @entity150 drum coda on the brilliantly histrionic you feel so lonely you could die ) , heroes , @entity152 , scary monsters , @entity154 and outside as well as – saliently – his last two albums			0
there are some seriously good tunes on the album , which is released tomorrow , not least the beautiful anti-war i ’d rather be high			0
do we really have to rely on a sexagenarian like @entity4 to write the greatest protest song of the new decade ? apparently we do			1
personally , i think the album is two or three songs too long ( there are 14 plus three additional tracks on the deluxe version ) but then what album is n’t these days ? and i hardly think you can begrudge @entity4 from overloading his comeback album , having not released anything officially for a decade			1
in the ten years since @entity4 has been away , he has been more active than at any time in his career			2
or rather , we have all been active on his behalf			0
in this vacuum has arisen one of the greatest mass cults of the modern age			0
you may have thought @entity4 was a cult hero before he disappeared , but since 2003 @entity179 has become even more of a religion than @entity181			2
there have been dozens and dozens of newspaper articles , magazine covers , exhibitions , anniversaries , homages , books ( apologies ) , tv specials and films			2
there ’s even a plaque in @entity195 in @entity197 ’s @entity196 to commemorate the photo session for the @entity199 ( and to which we bowiephiles all trooped , out of little but abject devotion )			0
back in 1974 , @entity4 released a ramshackle concert album called @entity203			2
he looked and sounded so tired , jaded and drug - addled , he later said it should have been called @entity206			0
well , in 2013 , and at the mighty age of 66 , it can safely be said that @entity4 is @entity209			2
@entity84 is author of when @entity85 : @entity4 and four minutes that shook @entity88			2

@entity4 took out newspaper ad with lyrics of old songs and 17 new ones
he also posted lyrics on *social* *networking* sites @entity21 and @entity22
