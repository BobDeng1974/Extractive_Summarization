he worked the centre - halves and for a young player his movement is very good			0
' from where i was standing , i could n't be sure if it was a penalty or not			0
but having been given it , for @entity0 to step up and taki it with such conviction was great			0

' he missed a chance in the first half and of course his finishing still needs to be a little bit more clinical but he will get there because of the work he does , even after every training session			0

but when @entity64 tripped him on the edge of the box – replays showed it was just outside – referee @entity68 pointed to the spot and @entity0 confidently despatched his penalty to @entity27 's right while the @entity71 dived to the left			2
