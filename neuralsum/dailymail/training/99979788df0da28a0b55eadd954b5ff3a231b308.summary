to underline the quality of the @entity4 side , six of their line - up were @entity6 winners			1
@entity7 , a 2010 champion with @entity8 , supplemented @entity10 club - mates @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 who triumphed in @entity16 last summer			0
@entity18 defender @entity17 will remember them , he was part of the @entity22 side that lost in the final , as was sub @entity24			0
@entity7 was one of six @entity6 winners in @entity27 's starting xi against @entity18 he may no longer be in situ but this is the sort of week former city chief executive @entity30 dreamed of when he put up provocative ' welcome to @entity32 posters ' and claimed they would be the biggest team in the world			1
while @entity18 went toe - to - toe with mighty @entity4 , @entity36 and his @entity38 team - mates were on a team - bonding night out in a @entity32 restaurant this week , jealously looking out at all the @entity42 participants			1
@entity15 felt he should have had a penalty after being tripped when facing an open goal @entity18 have recently signed up all their big - name stars on long - term contracts - except @entity47			2
but @entity49 's @entity48 ca n't have done his negotiating position any harm with a performance that suggested he 's back to his very best			0
two saves in particular from @entity15 and @entity14 were world - class			0
quite a difference from a year ago when he was blamed for @entity18 's home defeat against the same opposition and dropped soon after			0
@entity47 performed admirably against @entity4 , pulling off a string of impressive saves @entity62 , serving his last game of a touchline ban , watched on from the posh seats in the @entity66 next to academy director @entity67 , without the help of an abacus			1
last season the @entity70 suffered his most embarrassing moment as city manager in @entity73 when he confessed he had n't realised a 4 - 2 @entity18 win would have left them as group winners to avoid a knockout tie against @entity78 , at 3 - 2 up , @entity62 made a defensive substitution by sending on @entity80 for @entity81			1
with @entity62 serving a touchline ban , his assistant @entity82 took his place on the bench @entity18 's executives @entity87 and @entity88 are unabashed @entity89 fans , keeping a close eye on his tactics and dreaming he may one day be lured to the @entity92			1
it was interesting to see how @entity89 has developed from his @entity78 days			0
@entity94 led the line instead of a false number nine and @entity97 would kill for wing - backs like @entity99 and @entity100			0
@entity18 's executives @entity87 and @entity88 are unabashed fans of @entity4 manager @entity89 for all the quality on show , there was a fair amount of rough - and - tumble too			2
@entity15 was physically fended off by @entity106 in the first minute , @entity81 hurt his back as things got fierce in the trenches			0
if it sets a @entity42 trend , how much will @entity18 regret sending their " @entity113 " @entity112 out on loan to comply with @entity116 regulations and an enforced @entity42 squad			1
@entity18 and @entity4 are full of quality , but physicality played a significant role in the match			2

@entity7 one of six @entity6 winners in @entity4 starting @entity124
@entity18 playing in @entity42 , *unlike* rivals *united*
@entity47 's performance will help his contract negotiations
@entity62 was serving touchline ban
@entity18 might regret *selling* @entity112
