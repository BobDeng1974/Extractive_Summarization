by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 19 june 2013 the style guide for this year 's @entity2 has been released - and the spirit of smart dressing that the race course was keen to introduce last year returns for another year			2
in 2012 the @entity2 unveiled a new list of sartorial rules which included banning fascinators within the @entity10 and forbidding anyone from wearing strapless dresses anywhere in the park			1
now , alongside a brochure detailing the dress - up dos and don'ts of the sporting festival , @entity2 organisers have launched a video to remind racegoers how long dresses ought to hang and what sort of top hats gentlemen should be wearing			1
sheer strap dresses and tops are not permitted , and if jackets or pashminas are worn the dresses underneath must adhere to guidelines			1
in the @entity10 rules are even stricter , with women forbidden from wearing fascinators			1
hats must be worn at all times , but only ' a headpiece which has a base of 4 inches ( 10cm ) or more in diameter is acceptable '			2

all images taken from the 2013 @entity86 the brochure supplied by @entity2 suggests designers such as @entity89 , @entity45 and @entity81 for women , @entity33 , @entity91 and @entity92 for men			0
in 2012 , ' dress - code assistants ' handed pashminas out to women who had n't interpreted the rules correctly spotting displays of outrageous fashion used to be an annual attraction at @entity2 , but in 2012 organisers put an end to the trend of shrinking skirts and fascinators by implementing the tough new dress code			1
' fashion police ' were hired to make sure no exceptions made it into the @entity10 on @entity110 , with eagle - eyed ' dress code assistants ' armed with a selection of waistcoats , ties , pashminas and other items to help the under - dressed cover up			1
the new dress code was announced in january 2012 , and organisers sent out reminders with badges and tickets , something which will likely be repeated this year			0
@entity122 , chief executive of @entity2 , said at the time : ' @entity2 is @entity125 's flagship race meeting and one of the world 's greatest sporting and social events			0
' we have tried to provide an appropriate dress code that is clear , workable and in line with the wishes of racegoers			0
' during the meeting itself , our team of special dress code assistants will help people with any queries that they may have			0
