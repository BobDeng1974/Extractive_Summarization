whether its the romance of @entity4 or the magic of @entity6 , classic children 's tales have long held appeal for both parents and their offspring alike			0
now publisher @entity10 has now announced plans to make all of its books gender - neutral in a bid to ensure that children are n't swayed by their sex when choosing reading material			1
gendered titles include @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , which along with @entity22 , includes classic yarn , @entity24			0
gender - neutral : publisher @entity10 will no longer include ' girls ' or ' boys ' branding on its books the publishing house , which is famous for its much - loved @entity31 primary reading books , said the re-brand , which will only affect six titles , came about after a petition was delivered by campaigners			1
speaking to activists from @entity38 , a spokesman for the company said : ' at @entity10 , we certainly do n’t want to be seen to be limiting children in any way			2
' out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print , we actually only have the six [ gendered ] titles you cite … so we offer a vast range for children and their parents			0
' let books be books is an off - shoot of the larger @entity52 , which lobbies to have gendered branding removed from playthings			1
targets include anything branded with ' boys ' or ' girls ' such as @entity61 's ' @entity60 ' and ' @entity63 ' ranges or @entity65 's ' @entity64 for @entity66			0
popular : although @entity4 , seen here in @entity69 's @entity68 , has long hair , boys enjoy her exploits too much loved : @entity10 is famous for its @entity31 and @entity73 series of primary reading books several publishing houses have already responded to the campaign , among them @entity10 's parent company @entity80 which has promised to follow suit			1
the parent - led group , which grew out of a thread on @entity85 , has already enjoyed a series of successes , and has persuaded toy retailers @entity61 , @entity89 's and @entity90 , among others , to rethink their branding			1
' we ’re asking children ’s publishers to take the ‘ boys ’ and ‘ girls ’ labels off books and allow children to choose freely what kinds of stories and activity books interest them , ' say campaigners on their website			2
change : @entity10 agreed to change its ways following an approach from the @entity109 campaign ' these books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys			2
' blue covers , with themes of action and adventure , robots , space , trucks and pirates contrast with a riot of pink sparkles , fairies , princesses , flowers and butterflies			0
' but real children ’s interests are a lot more diverse , and more interesting , than that			0

@entity10 , which publishes @entity31 and @entity73 , is to go gender - neutral
