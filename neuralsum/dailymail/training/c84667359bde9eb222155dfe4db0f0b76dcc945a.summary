by @entity0 published : 19:57 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 19:57 est , 19 july 2013 catfight : @entity2 , 83 , has had a solicitor ¿ s letter demanding £ 500 compensation for a bite inflicted by a cat which she no longer consider hers when her cat decided to move in with the neighbours , @entity2 assumed he was no longer her responsibility			1
not in the eyes of the law			0
the 83 - year - old has had a solicitor ’s letter demanding £ 500 compensation for a bite inflicted by @entity19 the ginger tom			1
the victim , @entity21 , says the wound was so deep she had to spend four days in hospital and faced possible amputation			1
the grandmother - of - six - says she has never had any problems before and said the cat was well - behaved ever since her late husband bought it three and a half years ago			1
after being confronted by @entity30 close after the incident , mrs @entity2 agreed to have @entity19 put down – much to her distress as the cat was a reminder of her late husband , @entity35 , who passed away aged 85			1
the grandmother of six , who works part - time in a charity shop , said : ‘ the cat was a great comfort to him when he was dying so it was always nice to see him around			2
’ but as cats often do , after the death of its owner , @entity19 left mrs @entity2 ’s home and became something of a ‘ neighbourhood pet ’			1
shortly afterwards he was taken in by a family who lived behind the @entity50 ’ , who renamed him @entity51 and let him sleep at the end of their bed			0
earlier this year , however , the family moved home , letting the property to @entity21 and her two teenage children who agreed to continue taking care of him			0
but on the day they moved in the 46 - year - old full - time carer says she was bitten so badly the doctors said her hand may need to be amputated			1
she subsequently captured the cat , took it to the vets and discovered it had been micro-chipped and belonged to the @entity50			2
it was then that she consulted @entity68 , who wrote to the 83 - year - old			2
the letter demand she pay £ 500 for @entity73 ’s medical report and stated : ‘ the reason we are alleging fault is that you are negligent and / or breached your statutory duty pursuant to the @entity79			1
‘ we allege that your cat exhibited characteristics which were known to you as its owner and that you failed to take sufficient steps to prevent the attack			2
’ feral feline : @entity19 the ginger tom bit mrs @entity2 's neighbour @entity21 so badly she faced amputation ( file photo ) but mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i was so shocked to receive the letter , at first i did n’t even believe it was for me			1
i thought it must be some mistake			0
‘ i liked seeing @entity19 every now and then and would leave milk out for him , but as far as i was concerned he had moved on as cats often do			1
‘ i have n’t been able to sleep ever since and i just do n’t know what to do			0
when i first received the letter i was worried that they ’d send me to prison , ’ she said			2
‘ if it is true what happened to this lady , it is very unfortunate , but it honestly has nothing to do with me			0
she added : ‘ the only time he ever bit me was when i stood on its tale once and it gave me a nip , but i did n’t draw blood			2
’ however , miss close , who is a full - time carer for her mother and father who live next door , said she believed mrs @entity2 knew about the cat ’s alleged aggressive behaviour			1
‘ i love cats and have them as pets and this has never happened to me before , ’ she said			0
i lent down to give him a stroke , he rolled onto his back and was purring then he suddenly bit into my hand with both paws			0
‘ it left two marks on my hand , which by the morning had swelled up like a balloon and i could n’t move my thumb			0
’ she said she could n’t drive because of the swelling and had to call her friend to drive her to @entity130 , after her local gp told her the infection was serious			0
miss @entity21 said she has ‘ never been so scared in her life , ’ adding that doctors told her they feared she may have to have it amputated			0
‘ i was worried i would n’t be able to care for my parents , ’ she said .			0
