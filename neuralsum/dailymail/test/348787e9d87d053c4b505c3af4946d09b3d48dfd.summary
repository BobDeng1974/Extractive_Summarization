the @entity21 ridgeback was left with injuries to all four paws as well as grazing to his chest and a deep wound on his elbow			1
he is believed to have somehow escaped from the boot of her car and was dragged along the single carriageway because his lead was attached to the vehicle 's tailgate			2

@entity0 has also been banned from keeping animals for five years and had her 27 other dogs confiscated			1
chairman of the bench @entity47 said if @entity49 had been taken to the vet earlier ' unnecessary suffering ' could have been avoided			1
he said : ' we believe for whatever reason , known only to yourself , you had no intention of getting veterinary treatment as a matter of urgency			0
' we do not accept your reason for delaying treatment as reasonable			0
' the incident took place on june 11 , 2014 , when the dog was seen being dragged along the @entity64 behind the car			2
tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get @entity0 , who is a @entity68 breeder and exhibitor , to stop her car			1
she did n't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the @entity76 , the court heard			0

' @entity76 inspector @entity103 said after the sentencing : ' eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph			1
' this must have been horrific for poor tango			0
so painful , and so distressing			0
' it is hard to say what caused @entity77 to be dragged behind a moving car in this way , but by the time we found him , seven hours later , he was urgently in need of vet treatment			2
the animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns , suffered when he was dragged along the road judges ruled that the dog 's suffering could have been avoided if @entity0 had taken him to the vets earlier ' he had injuries to the pads of all four feet , causing the black layer of skin to be removed			1
he also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area			0
' it took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort			0
' @entity0 was also ordered to pay Â£ 3,000 costs , given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am			2
@entity77 was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care			0

earlier this month the case was thrown out after the @entity159 ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their @entity19 home			0
@entity164 had been granted a warrant to investigate ' nuisance ' at the house , following complaints about noise and dog faeces			0
the council joined forces with the @entity76 and seized 44 dogs from the house , with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated			0
however the trial was halted when district judge @entity179 said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant .			0
