by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 12:07 est , 4 february 2013 these chilling police mugshots were taken nearly a decade apart - but the arrogant scowl of the underworld kingpin they depict has not changed in that time			2
the first picture , taken in 2003 , shows @entity6 aged just 19 , soon after he helped beat a pub landlord to death during a botched robbery			1
and the second dates from just four months ago , after @entity11 , now 29 , was caught with £ 160,000 worth of cocaine on him during a taxi ride			1
the @entity16 gang boss has just started a seven - year prison sentence - and he is set to be questioned over the unsolved murder of a personal trainer who was shot dead in a bar in 2011			1
along with three accomplices , he was jailed for eight and a half years in december 2003 for manslaughter and robbery over the death of pub owner @entity35			1
the 47 - year - old was beaten to death with a fencepost while trying to stop the armed gang from stealing his takings			2
@entity11 served around four years in prison before his release in 2007			1
he was arrested on suspicion of murder in september 2011 in relation to the death of gym worker @entity47 , 37 , who was shot dead at point - blank range during a late - night lock - in at a pub in @entity16			1
victims : @entity11 was convicted of killing @entity35 , left , in 2003 , and has been questioned over the murder of @entity47 , right , in a @entity16 pub in 2011 his last night : mr @entity47 at the @entity55 pub hours before he was shot dead by a mystery gunman up to 30 drinkers witnessed the shooting , but even though a £ 50,000 reward was offered for information leading to the killer 's conviction no one has been charged with the murder			1
the pub 's @entity66 hard drive was stolen shortly after the killing and the murder weapon has not been recovered , while gangsters waged a graffiti campaign warning locals against speaking out			1
police complained about coming up against a ' wall of silence ' during their investigation into the incident			0
@entity11 was not charged in relation to mr @entity47 's death , and was on bail in october last year when the taxi which was carrying him was stopped in @entity83			0
when police searched the cab , they found a large brick - shaped package wrapped in tape and stashed in a plastic bag			0
the package contained 990 grams of cocaine , with a purity of 83 per cent and a street value of up to £ 160,000			2
robbery : @entity11 was burgling the @entity94 when he and his accomplices beat mr @entity35 to death mystery : patrons of the @entity55 have refused to talk to police investigating the death of mr @entity47 text messages on @entity11 's phone contained multiple references to the sale of drugs , while other messages consisted of threats to customers who were in debt to him			0
last week , he pleaded guilty to possession of a @entity115 drug with intent to supply at @entity117			0
detective chief inspector @entity118 , of @entity119 , said : ' the jailing of @entity11 for more than seven years is an absolutely fantastic result			2
' what this shows is that absolutely no one is untouchable			0
criminals who terrorise communities with their drug dealing - which is often backed up with threats of violence - think they are above the law and can not be caught			2
they could not be more wrong			0
' i want to use this case to send a message to the people of @entity16 that we are constantly looking at different ways we can disrupt and dismantle members of organised crime groups who create a cycle of misery with their drug dealing and violent actions			0
' what this result shows is that no one - regardless of their status within the criminal fraternity - can escape justice			0
