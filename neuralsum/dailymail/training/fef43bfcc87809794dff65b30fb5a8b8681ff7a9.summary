on the hunt : @entity7 , now aged 34 , was dumped in a box as a baby outside a stranger 's house just hours after being born in 1980 - and now she is determined to track down her birth parents extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital and her foster mother by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth			1

' i would just love to know what my mother looks like			0
we had a gathering at @entity43 with my husband @entity45 's family and my two sons have always resembled them			0
' i have never looked like anyone			0
' the fateful night : initially named @entity15 after the @entity11 who dropped the 7lb 1oz baby at a hospital , she is hoping @entity16 can finally lead her to her parents after she was abandoned on a freezing cold night 34 years ago appealing directly to her birth parents , she said : ' i would like to know what happened so please contact me			1

i have had a great life and i could not wish for a better mum and dad but i am just intrigued to find out what happened and why			0

all the retired librarian heard was a loud bang and the sound of someone running away			0
when she saw the box , miss @entity69 thought it was old clothes dropped off by a friend , and it was only when she took it indoors she discovered the new - born girl , naked apart from a towel			1
search : extensive appeals were made throughout 1980 in newspapers and on television but the only contact was phone calls to the hospital by a distressed woman in the weeks after her birth ( pictured here back in hospital after being left on a librarian 's doorstep ) she immediately called the police and the infant was whisked to the nearby @entity95 , where the only harm seemed to be bruising consistent with what was called ' an unassisted birth '			1
@entity32 said : ' i think i was born in the hospital grounds			0
a man was seen at the hospital carrying a box around and i was on a doorstep that was very close to the hospital			2
as she is today : @entity32 , who lived in an @entity107 village until she was aged six years and now lives in @entity108 and is a married mother of two ' my mum and my dad and i have always thought she ( her birth mum ) was very young and scared because back then having a baby at that age was frowned upon			0
' we just wo n't know until more information comes to light but that is my theory			0
' as part of the new appeal , she posted photographs of herself as a baby and the box she was discovered in and the @entity16 page has now been shared around the world , with the pictures viewed tens of thousands of times			1
her adoptive parents told her the story at an early age but it was only as a teenager and then when she became a mother of two sons , now aged nine and five years , that she became increasingly keen to trace her mother			2
@entity32 , who lived in an @entity107 village until she was aged six years and now lives in @entity108 , has had files from the police that have given her a lot of information , ' but not quite enough ' , and asked social services if anyone ever came forward but has never made the crucial breakthrough			0
it was only after she read about another abandoned baby on @entity16 that she thought the social media site could help in her search			2
' i never thought i would get anywhere , ' said @entity32 , who runs her own cleaning company			0
' i thought i would try @entity16 and i just can not believe the response			2
' people have been putting messages on and i never expected it			0
' @entity32 was placed in the foster care of @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity107 , as police chased up leads in @entity64 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , where the chocolate mousse box that carried her was originally from			1
evidence : @entity32 , who was left in this chocolate mousse box , had files from the police that have given her a lot of information , ' but not quite enough ' and now she seeks more @entity15 : at 11 weeks ' @entity15 ' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in @entity172 , @entity173 when she was aged six years			1
she now goes by the name of @entity32 there were six telephone calls from a distressed woman claiming to be the mother to the hospital and others later to mrs @entity155 after a nationwide appeal for help			0
at 11 weeks ' @entity15 ' was given to her adoptive parents and she grew up locally until the family moved to a village in @entity172 , @entity173 when she was six years old			2

' @entity32 is hoping that time may have come			0
