by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity2 ’s test of nerve the cameras will capture every facial twitch between @entity6 and @entity2 , but the @entity7 can not afford to lose focus			2
he has fallen three times to @entity6 in his 11 tests			2
@entity6 trapped him lbw on his debut at @entity13 in 2012 and has taken his wicket twice in this series			2
ready to go : @entity6 is all smiles as he prepares for the fourth test at @entity18 @entity19 backs @entity2 ahead of fourth test bowlers ’ @entity22 misery @entity6 will be looking to put a mediocre record on his home ground behind him			1
his 12 wickets in four tests at @entity18 have cost a middling 35 apiece			0
last year against @entity28 he returned first - innings figures of none for 116 — the worst of his 97 - @entity32 career			0
@entity33 has taken two wickets at 108 each in his two @entity35			0
grounds to improve : @entity33 does not have a great record at @entity18 this will be only the third test staged at @entity18 since 2008 , but @entity40 have a proud record here			2
since losing to @entity28 in 1997 , they have lost only one of 12 tests in @entity22 — against @entity45 in 2001 , a test famous for umpire @entity47 missing a string of wicket - taking no - balls from @entity50			0
forget @entity6 ... watch out for @entity51 aside from @entity6 and @entity2 , the two players most likely to exchange a few unpleasantries are probably @entity51 and @entity54			1
it went scarcely remarked upon on the last afternoon at @entity56 that @entity54 celebrated in @entity51 ’s face after @entity58 was caught at deep midwicket			1
and when @entity51 himself hooked to deep backward square , @entity54 made a point of posturing provocatively in his direction while the rest of the @entity7 team celebrated in a huddle			1
in the firing line : @entity51 and @entity54 could renew hostilities at @entity18 @entity69 have played eight tests at @entity18 and are yet to register a victory — losing three and drawing five			1
their most recent game here was as far back as 1990 , when the 17 - year - old @entity75 made an unbeaten century on the final day to salvage a draw			0
little master : @entity75 scored a century for @entity69 at @entity18 in 1990 does @entity78 need a fielder down at @entity80 ? is it about time @entity40 plugged third man from the start of @entity69 ’s innings ? statistics show that @entity6 in particular has suffered for @entity78 ’s reluctance to post a fielder for the steer through the slip cordon			1
of the 384 runs he conceded in the first three tests , 126 came through third man			0
by contrast , @entity7 opening bowler @entity93 has leaked only 67 runs to the same region , having given up 341 in total .			0

@entity6 has a mediocre record at his home ground
@entity51 and @entity54 have *history* of unpleasantries in this series
@entity69 look to end *winless* record at @entity18
