it was somehow apt that @entity1 should talk of @entity3 ’s need for a more aggressive one - day approach at the @entity5 on the day @entity6 smashed a world record 264 for @entity8 against @entity9			1
for nothing sums up the magnitude of @entity13 ’s task in @entity14 and @entity15 better than the fact that @entity6 ’s score would have been enough on its own to defeat @entity3 in seven of their last 10 one - day internationals			1
@entity1 , one of the few @entity3 batsmen who could get somewhere close to @entity6 ’s heroics if given enough time , attempted to place the feat in context at @entity25 while admitting that different @entity5 tactics will be needed			1
@entity6 - seen here batting against @entity3 in august - hit a world record 264 for @entity8 on thursday @entity1 shows his array of shots against @entity8 at @entity30 in september ‘ i suppose the comparison to that is us bowling a team out for 140 which we have done before in our conditions , ’ said @entity1 when asked about the small matter of @entity8 ’s 404 for five in @entity32			1
‘ it depends where you are playing			0
if we were playing in @entity8 or at the @entity42 every game then you might see the odd score like that from us			2
remember @entity8 are two up in the series with their tails up , too			2
you never know what ’s possible			0
’ still , the suspicion remains that @entity3 , with their emphasis on the old - fashioned way of keeping wickets in hand for a late burst from the likes of @entity1 and @entity58 , are still playing a very different game to that seen in @entity32			1
@entity1 , a key man when @entity3 go to @entity9 on sunday for a seven - match one - day series to prepare for their latest attempt to make an impact at the @entity5 , agrees up to a point			2
@entity1 - seen here with @entity8 captain @entity65 - is expected to play a pivotal role at the @entity5 ‘ building a platform can work in @entity3 but i ’m not sure we can backload it as much in @entity14 , ’ said @entity1 , who was below his best for much of last season before finding his innovative touch again in the final @entity70 international against @entity8			1
‘ the one - day series there last winter was a huge eye - opener , especially the way the @entity14 took us on			0
we will need to be more explosive throughout the innings , not just at the start , with us all taking more responsibility			0
’ the role of @entity13 at the top of @entity3 ’s one - day order remains an issue			1
it is perfectly possible for @entity3 ’s captain to bat through 50 - overs for a hundred plus			2
but is that enough these days and does his strike - rate put pressure on those that follow ? ‘ @entity13 is an excellent player and an excellent captain , ’ said @entity1			2
‘ he has been light on runs but then so have i and so has @entity100			0
@entity101 can score quickly enough			0
every time we have a rain affected one - day match he always seems to find another way to score and he has huge respect in the dressing room			0
@entity3 captain @entity13 has come in for criticism for his batting style at the top of the order ‘ he does have another gear			1
it ’s just that , with the amount of @entity115 he ’s played , he has honed his game to that and has n’t had a huge amount of opportunity to develop specific one - day skills			0
the next four months are key to him being able to do that but he is an unbelievable player and i expect him to score runs and lead us to more one - day series wins			0
’ it is a view on @entity13 the one - day player that is made more interesting by the fact that @entity1 remains one of @entity131 ’s best friends in the @entity3 team and talked sympathetically about the exiled star at @entity25			1
the @entity134 insisted that @entity136 ’s book rather than @entity131 ’s was his reading of choice on holiday - ‘ but i ’ve heard @entity142 ’s book is excellent , ’ he smiled – and denied that his closeness to @entity131 has proved a problem with @entity3			2
@entity1 says he finds it ' terribly sad ' that his friend @entity131 is not in the @entity3 team ‘ i do n’t feel i was caught in the middle of anything and it has n’t been awkward for me being a friend of @entity142 , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ it ’s great having played with him and learned from him and i just feel it ’s terribly sad that he ’s not in the team at the moment being so young and with potentially his best years ahead of him			1
‘ that ’s just the way i feel			0
i would love to be out here playing cricket with @entity131 again but the fact of the matter is he ’s not involved anymore			0
’ and in @entity131 ’s absence it is @entity1 more than most who will have to deliver if @entity3 are going to get anywhere near emulating the likes of defending champions @entity8 and doing well at the next @entity5			1
