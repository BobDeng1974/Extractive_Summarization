@entity9 was left in intensive care for two weeks due to kidney failure after suffering from gastric illness , and it is likely the damage was so severe he will need a kidney transplant			1
ten were confirmed in the @entity24 area , with others reported in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
the @entity6 were visiting family in @entity26 and have instructed lawyers to investigate how the two young children contracted @entity2			2
@entity9 's father @entity32 , said : ' it was absolutely heart - breaking and terrifying to see @entity9 in intensive care and then going through dialysis every day			1
thankfully , he is now in a stable condition but the whole situation has been very scary for us all			0
an outbreak of @entity2 in @entity4 , that is believed to have started in june last year , is still being investigated by @entity40 ' we have been told that he is not suffering from neurological problems , but experts are unsure how this illness will affect him in the long - term			1
' we are extremely upset and angry that his condition was not diagnosed earlier and that @entity49 were apparently not informed of an outbreak of @entity2 and the symptoms to look out for			0
' we want to know how this could have happened and we have approached lawyers because we heard that other children in the area were ill with similar symptoms			2
@entity2 or @entity2 , is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans			0
many strains are harmless , but some can cause serious health problems			0
about 35,000 people are struck down by different forms of @entity2 infection every year			2
many cases are mild , such as urinary tract infections , but 1,000 a year are hit by @entity2 food poisoning which can be very serious , particularly to children and the elderly			1
the most common serious @entity2 strain in @entity74 is @entity75			0
symptoms include severe diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever			0
infections can cause serious complications such as potentially fatal kidney problems or brain damage			2

it may also harm the heart			0
infection is spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria , or through contact with infected people or farm animals			0
a severe outbreak at a petting farm in @entity100 affected 76 young children in 2009 , ten of them suffering long - term effects			2
the @entity74 ’s largest @entity2 food poisoning outbreak killed 21 people in @entity106 in 1996			0
' i hope that they can find out what caused our children 's ' illnesses so that lessons can be learned and no one else has to suffer as my children have done			0
' @entity116 is a rare strain of the bacteria which can have very serious consequences			0
@entity9 's symptoms began in early november 2014 and he suffered with diarrhoea and sickness			1
he visited his doctor on two occasions , but unfortunately his condition worsened and he suffered a number of seizures and became disorientated			0
he was rushed to hospital and diagnosed with hemolytic - uremic syndrome ( @entity129 )			2
he spent two weeks in intensive care and required daily dialysis for a number of weeks due to the severity of his symptoms			1
he is still receiving dialysis three times a week and his treating doctors have confirmed that he is likely to need a kidney transplant in the future because of the severity of the damage to his kidneys			0
now @entity9 's father @entity32 , 31 , from @entity144 has instructed public health lawyers at @entity146 to investigate why his son and daughter contracted the disease which ruined their trip away			1
@entity152 , a solicitor and expert public health lawyer at @entity146 said : ' the illness described to us by our clients is particularly concerning and it illustrates the serious consequences @entity2 can have on vulnerable people , particularly children			0
' sadly , many of our clients have suffered long - term and often permanent health problems arising from their initial infections including kidney damage and severe neurological injury			1
we hope that @entity9 , @entity5 and everyone else affected by this outbreak make a complete and swift recovery			1
' we will be obtaining detailed expert medical evidence to identify the extent of any long - term health issues that there may be for our clients and to pinpoint the risks of any future complications which may affect their health and quality of life			0
' the seriousness of severe gastric illness should never be underestimated and it is vital that authorities work quickly and thoroughly to determine the cause of the outbreak in @entity4 and establish if there is a wider problem in the way illness outbreaks are controlled , as this follows other @entity74 - wide outbreaks of bacterial illness in recent months			1
' ' as we conduct our investigations we ask anyone who has also suffered gastric illness , which could be related to the recently reported outbreak in @entity4 , to contact with to assist us with our enquiries on behalf of @entity9 and @entity5			1
' @entity40 ( @entity192 ) and local environmental health officials are investigating the outbreak in a bid to find the cause			1
a spokesperson for @entity40 told @entity198 : ' the investigation is ongoing and although we have n't had any reported cases of @entity2 since november , every effort is being made to discover the cause			1
' we have conducted enhanced screening in @entity4 , but we have yet to find a real link concerning all the cases , apart from that they are all from @entity4			1
' it 's a multi-agency team that deals with outbreak control , from the @entity40 to food hygiene standards , and the work is ongoing			2
