a lifelong dream becomes reality for @entity2 in @entity3 on sunday , as the former punk rocker from @entity5 sits on his bike to begin the world ’s most punishing motorsport event			1
the 43 - year - old @entity9 , a builder by trade , will put his bike , body and possibly even his life on the line during the @entity16 , the 5,500 - mile race across the @entity18 and the @entity20 desert			1
he has left his partner and two sons , including three - month - old @entity23 , behind and even sold their farm to fund his ride of a lifetime			0
@entity2 is set to embark on the the 5,500 - mile @entity16 race across the @entity18 and the @entity20 desert @entity2 , a builder by trade , has left his partner and two sons to embark on his race of a lifetime ‘ he ’s always wanted to do the @entity16 , it ’s been a dream of his , ’ said partner @entity32 , who remains confident , if a little anxious			1
‘ he ’s quite a safe rider , it ’s just everything else that goes into the equation that worries me			2
it ’s a bit of a mixed bag because i ’m excited for him but obviously it ’s a bit tricky here for the next three weeks with two young kids			0
’ and that ’s also the hardest part for @entity2 , who once upon a time played drums and bass in punk bands @entity50 and @entity51 , but nowadays is found doting on @entity32 and the children			2
‘ i have pictures of my two sons with me at all times and i miss them greatly , ’ he said			0
thoughts of home will disappear on sunday , however , when @entity59 lines up at the start of one of the most gruelling and dangerous of all races			0
a total of 665 competitors will leave @entity3 in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles			1
@entity70 interest is restricted to a mere eight racers , a far cry from the heyday of the old @entity74 when dozens of home hopefuls would cross the @entity76 and begin the epic journey down to @entity16 in @entity78			1
@entity59 will be one of 665 competitors racing in in cars and trucks and on quad bikes and motorcycles @entity2 , whose preparations for the rally have not been ideal - he broke his wrist in august and crashed out of the @entity86 in october - is @entity70 ’s only amateur rider this year , though @entity90 from @entity91 and @entity92 , from @entity93 , founders of @entity89 @entity70 , continue to fly the flag in all categories , taking four cars , two trucks and two bikes			1
crossing the barren terrain of @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 sounds daunting enough , but @entity92 paints an even scarier picture			0
‘ the @entity16 is an addiction , it takes over your life , ’ he explained			2
‘ the organisation are out to break you and your vehicle , simple as that			0
‘ some of the terrain looks mind blowing when you see it and you never believe a vehicle can cross it , let alone at speed			0
‘ you can be 3km off track and still be classed as on course , yet a 10 - metre deviation in the desert can be a smooth fast track or a 500ft - deep canyon			2
the route designer puts secret waypoints that must be passed by into the most devilish places , at the top of the steepest dunes and the bottom of the biggest holes and sand pits			0
‘ in the daylight it is difficult , when the sun goes down it really sorts the men from the boys or the girls from the women			0
’ 43 - year - old 's preparations have been far from ideal having broken a wrist in august of the eight @entity70 competitors at @entity16 this year it is with @entity59 ’s sole compatriot in the bike category , @entity144 , where @entity70 hopes lie			1
@entity148 , 25 , has secured a ride with the dominant @entity151 squad , on the back of taking the second stage win riding a works @entity154 in last year ’s @entity16			1
for @entity59 , however , ambitions are more modest			0
given what lies ahead , the endless tests over unyielding surfaces , in extreme temperatures , from sea level to the peaks of the @entity18 and back , he speaks for the majority when he says : ‘ my expectation is simply to finish			2
’ @entity70 's @entity144 will be riding at @entity16 with the dominant @entity151 squad			1

the @entity16 is a 5,500 - mile race across the @entity18 and the @entity20 desert
@entity16 is regarded as world ’s most punishing motorsport event
@entity2 is @entity70 's only amateur rider competing this year
in total there are 665 competitors - with eight @entity70 *representatives*
