they were hailed as national heroines after footage emerged of them fighting back against men alleged to have sexually harassed them on a bus in @entity7			1
but a new video of @entity7 sisters @entity10 , 19 , and @entity11 , 22 , showing them starting a fight with another man has cast doubt on their story , fuelling accusations that they are ' man - beaters '			1
in a further twist , claims have also been made by female passengers on the bus in @entity21 , north @entity7 , that the original fight was over seats , not because the young women were sexually harassed			1
they claim he had verbally abused her , however this is clear from the video their ' self - defence ' on friday prompted widespread praise and the promise of a cash reward from the government , the @entity44 reported			2
but the new video shows the women talking to a man sat on a bench in a park , before one of the sisters grabs him by the shirt while the other hits him with her bag			1
the man , seemingly confused by the attack , backs away and tries to hold one of the sisters ' flailing arms as punches and slaps rain down on him			1
he is left with no option but to turn his back and run while one of the women casually checks her phone , as if nothing has happened			2
the @entity74 sisters claim the man had been verbally harassing them but this is not clear from the video			2
the footage emerged amid claims by passengers on the same bus as the sisters , who study at @entity83 , that the fight was over seats and that the girls were not sexually harassed , as they have claimed			1
the man holds back one of the young women 's arms as she tried to punch her , but he was eventually forced to flee passengers watched as the sisters beat up their three alleged abusers with a belt after no one intervened to help them			1
but according to the @entity44 , one witness , @entity96 , said : ' the two sisters were sitting on seat no. 8 which was allotted to an unwell woman passenger			0
' when the boys asked the sisters to vacate the seat , the two refused and started fighting			2
' the sisters claim the men had been touching @entity11 and that they grabbed her by the throat after she told them to stop			1
coming to her sister 's defence , @entity10 removed her belt and began hitting , kicking and punching the man holding her sister until he let go			1
they say they were forced off the bus and were only able to escape the men after throwing a brick at then			2

' heroine ' @entity7 sisters filmed starting a fight with a man in a park
the unidentified man does not *retaliate* as the sisters throw punches at him
he is forced to flee as the young women slap , kick and hit him with a bag
last week the pair were praised for fighting off alleged abusers on a bus
@entity10 and @entity11 were filmed beating the ' harassers ' with a belt
but the new footage has fuelled accusations that they are ' man - beaters '
passengers on the bus say the confrontation was over seats , not abuse
