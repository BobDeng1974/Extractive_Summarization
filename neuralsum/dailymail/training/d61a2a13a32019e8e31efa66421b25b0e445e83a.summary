by @entity0 published : 15:05 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 02:57 est , 7 june 2012 a ' super ' strain of untreatable gonorrhea is sweeping developed countries across the world including @entity5 and @entity6			1
the sexually transmitted disease , which infects millions of people every year , is becoming resistant to all antibiotics , according to the @entity10			1
the @entity12 health agency is urging governments and doctors to step up surveillance of the @entity16 , the second most common after chlamydia			1
dangerous mutations : neisseria gonorrhoeae , the bacterium that causes @entity21 , is developing new strands resistant to every treatment gonorrhea can cause inflammation , infertility , pregnancy complications and , in extreme cases , lead to maternal death			2
babies born to mothers with gonorrhea have a 50 per cent chance of developing eye infections that can result in blindness			1
' this organism has basically been developing resistance against every medication we 've thrown at it , ' said dr @entity40 , a scientist in @entity10 's department of @entity16			0
this includes a group of antibiotics called cephalosporins currently considered the last line of treatment			0
resistance to cephalosporins was first reported in @entity50 , but more recently has also been detected in @entity5 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			2
as these are all countries with well - developed health systems , it is likely that cephalosporin - resistant strains are also circulating undetected elsewhere			0
more than 17,000 new cases of gonorrhea were reported in the @entity5 in 2009			1
young men and women are affected most â€“ the highest rates of gonorrhea are seen in women aged 16 - 19 and men aged 20 - 24			2
' i think this is probably only the tip of the iceberg , ' said professor @entity70 , who oversees the national surveillance program for treatment of resistant gonorrhea in @entity74 and @entity75			0
clap : @entity77 used to be rife among sailors , soldiers and prostitutes as this @entity82 sexual hygiene poster warns doctors have blamed overuse or misuse of antibiotics for the disease moving towards becoming a superbug , coupled with the bacteria 's astonishing ability to adapt			1
professor @entity70 said doctors in @entity5 are now switching to using a combination of antibiotics over a longer period of time to combat resistant gonorrhea			1
dr @entity40 said that better sex education was needed , as proper condom use is an effective means of stopping transmission			0
' we 're not going to be able to get rid of it completely , ' she said in an interview ahead of @entity10 's public announcement on its ' global action plan ' to combat the disease			2
' but we can limit the spread			0
concern : the std is the second most common in the @entity5 and affects more than 17,000 people a year ( posed by model ) ' in a couple of years it will have become resistant to every treatment option we have available now			1
' dr @entity40 said the new guidance is aimed at ending complacency about gonorrhea and encouraging researchers to speed up their hunt for a new cure			2
once considered a scourge of sailors and soldiers , gonorrhea - known colloquially as the clap - became easily treatable with the discovery of penicillin			1
now , the global health body estimates that gonorrhea is responsible for 106million infections annually			1
it also increases the chances of infection with other diseases , such as @entity135			0
' it 's not a @entity138 problem or an @entity140 problem , it 's really a worldwide problem , ' said dr @entity40			0
these bacteria survive antibiotic treatment due to a mutation that makes them resistant , then quickly spread their genes in an accelerated process of natural selection			0
this is a general problem affecting all antibiotics , but gonorrhea is particularly quick to adapt because it is good at picking up snippets of @entity154 from other bacteria , said dr @entity40			1
' if it did n't do so much damage it would actually be a fun organism to study , ' she said			0
the over-the - counter availability of low potency antibiotics in some @entity161 countries is another reason resistance is increasing , she said			0
the @entity163 - based @entity10 wants countries not just to tighten their rules for antibiotic use but also to improve their surveillance systems so that the full extent of the problem can be determined .			0

babies born to gonorrhea - infected mothers have 50 per cent chance of being blind
106million new cases of disease annually - the second most common std after chlamydia
scientists blame overuse of antibiotics coupled with bacteria 's astonishing ability to adapt
doctors in @entity5 switching to using combination of antibiotics over longer period of time
close to becoming a superbug as researchers admit they can do little to halt its rapid spread
