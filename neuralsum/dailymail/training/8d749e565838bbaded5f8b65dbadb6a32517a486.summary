the 31 - year - old was eight months pregnant when she was pulled from the rubble of the destroyed school , and at the time she figured the trauma would cause her to lose her child			1
but on december 21 , @entity2 and her husband @entity17 welcomed a new son into the world and chose to name him after one of her students that did n't survive			1
namesake : @entity2 ( left ) was eight weeks pregnant when she survived a tornado that hit @entity7 , @entity8 last may			1
she gave birth to her son last month and named him after one of the students she lost when the school collapsed - 9 - year - old @entity30 ( right ) when the tornado got closer , @entity2 grabbed as many of her students as possible to huddle together			1
while the other students continued to squirm and talk , 9 - year - old @entity30 became exceptionally still when @entity2 put her hand on him			1
' he was the one closest to me that did n't make it , ' she told @entity39			2
i had my hand on him			0
he 's been a little hard to let go			0
' @entity42 was one of seven children who died after being crushed by a water line			2
@entity2 and her husband chose to memorialize @entity42 by giving their new son jack the middle name of @entity42			1
@entity42 's mother @entity49 was touched by the namesake for her son who loved going to the lake , playing with legos and listening to country music			2
rescued : in a now famous image , @entity2 was rescued from the rubble of @entity57 elementary school when she was already eight week pregnant the old @entity57 elementary school was completely destroyed in the tornado and did n't have any storm shelters			1

she has two other daughters , 6 and 3 ' he would get in trouble over some little thing and just flash me this big smile to get out of it			0
he just had one of those smiles , ' she said			0
after the tornado , @entity2 spent time in the hospital recovering from a broken back and sternum , strained neck , and lacerated tendons in her hand			1
a psychologist recommended that she not be told which of her students had died for two days , and when she was finally informed her shrieks could be heard down the hallway			0
she took no pain medication for her injuries since she did n't want to hurt her baby , and wore a back brace for six weeks while pregnant			1
and she 's still recovering from the emotional injuries			0
@entity2 says she sees a psychologist once a week , and is having a hard time dealing with her survivor 's guilt , constantly asking why she lived when innocent children died			2
while baby @entity72 gives her new hope and a reason to go on , he 's also a reminder of the trauma of that deadly day			0
