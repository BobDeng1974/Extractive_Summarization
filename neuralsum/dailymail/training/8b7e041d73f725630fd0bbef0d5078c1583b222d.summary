by @entity0 as a writer and former magazine editor , i can deal with deadlines			0
but when it comes to anything that does n’t have one , it ’s another matter — i often start to procrastinate			0
consider this sorry chain of events , which happened when i sat down to write a recent assignment , which had no firm deadline			0
first , i went to buy a cappuccino — i needed caffeine , i reasoned , to shake up my brain cells — followed by some wrapping paper for a child ’s birthday present that i remembered had to be delivered that day			0
then i read the newspaper ( research ) , washed my hair ( so it could dry while i worked ) and texted a man about a long - standing problem with the roof			1
a free magazine on the hall table beckoned — more research			0
by then , i ’d lost two hours			0
in short , or rather at length , with a growing knot of anxiety in my chest , i procrastinated			0
everything else seemed infinitely more pressing , or at least more doable , at that minute			2
and although i told myself i was clearing my slate of all other tasks that might distract me from work once i was sat down at my desk , the diminishing hours i had left became rather panic - stricken			1
i ’m far from alone with this bad habit : about a quarter of people say procrastinating is a defining part of their personality			1
in fact , it ’s a trait that ’s been with us for a long , long time — a magazine reported this week that @entity68 hieroglyphs dating back to @entity69 have been found that read : ‘ friend , stop putting off work and allow us to go home in good time			1
’ social media and internet browsing seem productive but valuable hours can be lost online ( posed by model ) but thanks to the rise in social media and the ease with which we can spend hours on the internet ( there are even sites where you can take tests to find out how much of a procrastinator you are ) , it ’s never been so easy to put things off			0
procrastination has always been my pet demon , sitting on my shoulder suggesting non-urgent activities to delay the one at hand			2
when i was at school , i filled up my homework book with lists of projects until there were so many outstanding tasks that i threw it away in the end , overwhelmed , work unfinished			1
at university , i spent far more time drawing up a multi-coloured revision timetable than doing any studying			0
procrastinating students suffer more colds , flu and gastro - intestinal problems i ’m so used to this demon , i ’m even slightly fond of it , kidding myself i work best under pressure			1
but this love / hate relationship recently developed from one of indulgent self - tolerance to deep annoyance			0
late one sleepless night , going to extremes , i had this thought : ‘ what if i keep deferring everything i need to do until i ’m dead , so i do n’t do any of it ? ’ after sharing this thought with a novelist friend , she put me in touch with personal coach and business mentor @entity126			1
‘ people who procrastinate are most likely to be high achievers who set high standards for themselves , but perversely never feel that they ’re good enough , ’ she says			1
‘ they are often creative types and self - expression is part of the job , so they feel their work exposes a part of them			1
the task builds up and they became fraught with anxiety and concern about being judged			0
‘ we become so scared of the task at hand , that putting it off becomes an easier option			1
the problem is that we ca n’t put them off for ever , so we end up doing things in a rush , then feel far worse			0
it ’s a perfect example of being unable to exhibit enough self - control to resist something that feels good at the time , even though we know it is bad for us			0
’ business mentor @entity126 says ‘ people who procrastinate are most likely to be high achievers who set high standards for themselves , but perversely never feel that they ’re good enough ' ( posed by model ) she tells me that a classic example of this is ‘ second novel syndrome ’ , where the fear of it not being good enough is so overwhelming it takes years , or ca n’t be written at all			1
‘ @entity163 , who wrote @entity164 , said she was actually relieved when her second book failed , because it liberated her to write a third without the pressure of expectation , ’ says @entity126			1
procrastination is fed not just by perfectionism , but a hazy grip on the notion of time			2
‘ people get attached to the idea that you have to have a certain time - frame to complete something really well — say , an hour			1
if they ca n’t see a clear hour to do something , they ’ll keep putting it off , ’ says @entity126			1
‘ drop that idea and you ’ll get results quicker — sometimes it ’s more important to get things done at all , than to do them perfectly			2
’ it makes sense in theory , but how do i stop myself from procrastinating in practice ? ‘ give yourself a shorter deadline , because work will always stretch to fit time allocated , ’ says @entity126			1
in other words , if you do n’t have one , or it ’s too far away , make a deadline up — any task with uncertain timing , no matter how mundane , can grind the mind to halt with its uncertainty			0
@entity0 found that the coffee run was a good way to procrastinate ( posed by model ) ‘ do first the thing you ’re most likely to put off , even if you only do it for 15 minutes , ’ she adds			1
‘ not knowing how long something will take can make it feel unbearable			2
‘ especially since we all now have a shortened attention span , thanks to the internet , smartphones and screens in every room			2
’ no one ever feels like going for a run , she says , but if you commit to just 15 minutes , it seems less scary and more do - able			2
you might end up running for half an hour and find yourself enjoying it			0
but you ca n’t do it alone			0
‘ numerous studies on @entity224 ’s resolutions show the people who give up quickly tend to be those who do n’t tell their peers what they are doing			1
‘ those who succeed have a strong support network			2
if you are out of your comfort zone and are n’t sure you can get things done , you need cheerleaders — plus , you lose face if you do n’t do it			0
’ equally , @entity126 says you should n’t label yourself a procrastinator , because other people ’s expectations shape your behaviour			1
‘ be very careful with how you are training others to see you , because it ’s a vicious cycle as people often perform as others expect them to			1
’ for things that really are n’t that important , like ironing , or sorting out your wardrobe , either delegate and pay someone else to do it if you can afford it , or cut yourself a deal			0
do it for 15 minutes or with the promise of a reward			2
inspired by this wise advice , i tell my husband that i ’m through with procrastinating — he looks dubious rather than encouraging , which is annoying — and put the 15 - minute rule into practice			1
with enough caffeine in the system , it works			0
fifteen minutes of most things is bearable and once you ’ve started anything you stop worrying about how well you ’re doing it , and just get on with it			2
i tidy the dolls ’ house with my daughter ( yup , even the dolls ’ house is a tip in our house ) for 15 minutes			2
i throw away the mound of bits of paper on my desk — i ca n’t read my own writing anyway			0
i send lots of outstanding emails			0
procrastination can feel like a treat but actually , as @entity126 says , it wears you out			1
the good news is that you can give it up — so stop putting it off			1
