visitors flock to @entity1 to see its impressive geysers , @entity4 and meandering glaciers			2
and soon there will be a new way of taking in the country ’s second largest ice cap near @entity10 – from an underground tunnel dug deep beneath the dense ice			1
@entity1 is due to open in the spring of next year and will enable tourists to take in blue ice at the heart of the @entity17 glacier and understand how it formed			1
but for now , there 's a video enabling people to take a virtual tour so they have an idea of what to expect			2
a screen shot is pictured a cgi video has been released to let people take a tour from the comfort of their sofa			0
it gives potential visitors an idea of what to expect , including tunnels , underground rooms and lit caverns			0
engineers are currently carving the 1,640 foot ( 500 metre ) long tunnel beneath the glacier and are installing lights to best show off the layers of ice			1

a geologist is on hand to advise on the operation @entity17 ( marked with a a red flag ) is located north east of @entity1 's capital , @entity10			1
it 's the is the second largest ice cap in @entity1 with an area of 953 square kilometres the glacier ( pictured ) is roughly parallel to the direction of the country 's active volcanic zone , running north - east to south - west			1
it is about 31 miles ( 50 km ) long and nine to 12 miles ( 15 - 20km ) wide if you stare into deep crevasses in glaciers - or take a tour beneath one - you will notice that the ice is blue			2
@entity69 , and ice near the surface , is white because the full spectrum of light is scattered and reflected			0
the ice looks blue because it is so dense , with no bubbles to scatter visible light			0
in ice , the absorption of light at the red end of the spectrum is six times greater than at the blue end			0
so as light travels into the glacier , red light is gradually lost			0
a lack of reflected red wavelengths mean that we see the ice as blue			0
glacial ice is made up of compacted snow that has fallen over thousands of years			0
visitors to the attraction will see stripes of subtly different coloured layers of ice that represent different periods of snowfall			2
the layers can be analysed to tell experts about the weather conditions at the time the snow fell			0
whiter layers formed when the weather was particularly cold , because air was trapped within the ice crystals , which is reflective			2
layers that are darker or bluer in colour were created by snowfall in warmer or wet conditions when little air was trapped in the snow			0
the weight of the snow build - up compressed the layers and the air trapped within them , causing ice at the heart of a glacier to appear a brilliant blue			1
@entity1 says the attraction will offer a ‘ once in a lifetime adventure , to explore around , on and within the mighty @entity17 glacier , where they will be able to see , the beautiful blue ice that lies at the heart of the glacier , ’ when it opens			1
tourists visiting the attraction will see large caves beneath the glacier ( pictured ) and will also be able to sit inside man - made rooms with ice furniture , according to the video tour people embarking on the tour will travel up the glacier to the ice cave , on eight - wheel drive super trucks			1
‘ exclusive groups , will experience the thrill of descending beneath the ice cap glacier , learning interesting facts about glaciers , and eventually reaching the beautiful and stunning blue ice , that lies at the heart of the glacier , ’ it says			1
tours will run between march and october depending on the weather			0
while there are other natural caves in @entity149 glaciers , they are seasonal , forming in warmer months and lasting in winter			0
visitors to the attraction will see stripes of subtly different coloured layers of ice ( pictured ) that represent different periods of snowfall			2
the layers can be analysed to tell experts about the weather conditions at the time the snow fell @entity162 says the attraction will offer a ‘ once in a lifetime adventure , to explore around , on and within the mighty @entity17 ( pictured from above ) , where they will be able to see , the beautiful blue ice that lies at the heart of the glacier ’			1

@entity1 is due to open in the spring 2015 and will enable tourists to take in blue ice at the heart of the @entity17 near @entity10
a @entity175 video offers a sneak peak of the underground tour
engineers are currently carving the 1,640 foot ( 500 metre ) long tunnel
it shows layers of subtly coloured ice , showing how the glacier formed
