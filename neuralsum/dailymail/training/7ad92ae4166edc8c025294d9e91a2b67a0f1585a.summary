by @entity1 reporter published : 19:16 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 02:58 est , 12 august 2013 the owner of a corgi has captured on camera the friendship between her dog and a tiny baby bunny			2
the corgi , @entity8 , met the little rabbit one day while she was out walking with her owner , @entity10			1
after that , whenever @entity8 left the house in @entity13 , @entity14 , for a walk , the bunny would pop up , ready to play			1
close encounter : @entity8 the corgi meets her new little friend @entity21 : the tiny bunny popped its head out of the grass when @entity8 came close no fear : the bunny jumped onto @entity8 's paw as she lay in the grass unlikely friendship : @entity31 and bunny take a turn together around the residential street where @entity8 lives with her owner ' this has happened two days in a row			2
we 'd take the corgi out to potty , and she 'd go sniffing around			0
bunny pops out , play - date starts , ' @entity10 wrote on @entity45			0
' i was lucky enough to have my phone on me the third time this happened			0
' @entity10 was slightly concerned her dog , who is named after @entity8 from the @entity54 movie @entity55 , might hurt the rabbit , but realized after watching the pair that she had no intention of injuring her new playmate			1
' the bunny ran around in circles around us instead of away , and jumped onto @entity8 's front paw while she was sitting			2
i want to believe the bunny chose to hang with her , ' wrote @entity10			0
instincts : a terrier bred for hunting might have attacked a tiny bunny like this , but @entity8 the corgi just wants to play thumper : the bunny bounds along happily beside @entity8 out for a stroll : the cute pair look perfectly at ease in each other 's company as they scamper about together believe it or not : @entity8 was named after @entity83 's character in the alien films corgis are of @entity87 origin , trained to herd animals			1
they 're reportedly one of the few breeds that can herd geese			0
perhaps @entity8 's herding instincts were at work as she rounded the bunny up off the road and towards the sidewalk			0
dog tales : @entity8 looks extremely pleased with herself as she hangs out with her rabbit friend leap of faith : @entity8 looks around for the bunny after jumping up onto the curb gentle nudge : the corgi seems to be trying to encourage the bunny to jump up onto the sidewalk with her this cute encounter could have had a different outcome if the tiny bunny had met a different dog			1
' @entity8 is pretty much one of the least threatening dogs around ... it could be because she grew up with a huge bunny and a hamster , ' wrote @entity10			0
the bunny hopped off after @entity10 called @entity8 inside , but she does n't think that 's the last @entity8 will see of the rabbit			1
@entity10 hopes that as the rabbit grows older , it will build its nest nearby so that @entity8 and her new mate can maintain their friendship - and she can take more cute photos .			2
