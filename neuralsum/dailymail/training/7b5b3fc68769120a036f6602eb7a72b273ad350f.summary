by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 05:48 est , 19 july 2013 the first mission to the moon 's south pole is being planned by two private companies that want to plant telescopes on top of a lunar mountain as early as 2016			1
the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) and a start - up called @entity11 have chosen the tricky location as they believe the telescopes will get a clear view of our galaxy			1
they plan on installing a two - metre radio antenna , plus a smaller optical telescope on the elevated rim of the @entity21 crater			1
the first mission to the @entity22 's south pole is being planned by @entity8 and @entity11			1
they want to plant telescopes on top of a lunar mountain ( pictured ) in as early as 2016 and believe the telescopes will get a clear view of our galaxy according to @entity29 , the @entity9 has set its sights on building a scientific and commercial base on the moon , while @entity11 wants to become a space courier service in the next 10 years			1
the companies have now joined forces with the intention of setting up two telescopes on the @entity22 's south pole as the instruments will not suffer our atmosphere 's hazy interference			1
the location also has the observational benefit of not picking up any radio or electromagnetic noise created by modern technology			2
the idea to place a telescope on the moon is not new			2
astronomers have long thought about putting telescopes on the dark side of the moon that always faces away from @entity55			2
it is hoped that pictures captured by such instruments would be clearer than anything taken on @entity55 or even in space			2
but telescopes in the location would depend upon satellite relays , which would be expensive			0
the beauty of locating telescopes on the @entity22 's south pole , however , is that the telescopes would have a ' direct line to @entity55 , ' @entity69 , founder and director of @entity9 told @entity72			1
astronomers have previously toyed with the idea of planting telescopes on the @entity76 , as they believe pictures captured by instruments devoid of atmospheric interference would be clearer than anything taken on @entity55 or even in space - the @entity81 telescope is pictured the spot on the @entity84 crater also has the benefit of a slightly milder climate than the dark side of the moon			1
one ' day ' on the moon lasts for the equivalent of an @entity55 month			0
it has two weeks of temperatures of over 120 degrees followed by chilling ' nights ' that last for another two weeks when the temperature drops to minus 170 degrees			0
this means engineering scientific instruments would need to be able to withstand the extreme climate and this has so far proved challenging			0
however , as the telescopes would be situated at the south pole , they would enjoy sunlight for 90 per cent of the moon 's day and consequently a relatively stable temperature of approximately minus 50 degrees @entity104			1
solar panels could therefore be used to collect energy and power the telescope , according to mr @entity69			0
due to the more consistent temperature and sunlight , he believes the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the moon			0
the south pole of the moon is popularly thought to be rich with resources			1
@entity11 , which intends to provide the lander and engineering expertise for the telescope , has ambitions to mine metals , minerals and water on the moon			1
the telescopes would be situated at the @entity22 's south pole which has a relatively stable temperature of minus 50 degrees			1
conditions on other parts of the @entity22 are much more varied			0
the companies believe the lunar poles are the best locations for any future human settlement on the @entity22 ( pictured ) the company believes resources could be sold to humans on @entity55 , while the water would be needed by astronauts living on a lunar base nearby			2
@entity138 , the company â€™s ceo , told @entity72 that during the mission , he plans on sending a small rover to explore the surface of the site			0
the mission , planned as soon as 2016 , is ambitious as the south pole of the moon has never been explored before			1
mr @entity138 conceded that due to the amount of finance needed - around $ 100 million - and pioneering engineering necessary for the mission , the schedule is tight			0
however , he hopes that national and international space agencies will help to pay for the mission and that it will take place by 2018			2
@entity11 has not landed a probe on the moon 's surface yet but aspires to land on the moon in 2015 to scoop the $ 20 million @entity156			1
the company is planning a mini mission to the moon to instal a shoebox - sized telescope with the aim of testing @entity9 's technology on the lunar landscape			2
two @entity165 politicians have proposed legislation that would establish a national historical park on the surface of the moon , according to @entity170			0
democrats @entity171 and @entity173 want to create a protected historical park at the sites of the @entity177 missions between 1969 and 1972			0
they reportedly said that the @entity179 would include all the artifacts left on the surface of the moon from the missions of @entity183 to @entity184			0
the text from the proposed @entity186 , reads : ' as commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire the ability to land on the @entity22 , it is necessary to protect the @entity177 lunar landing sites for posterity			0
' it would be run by the @entity194 and the @entity195 and @entity196 , but first the @entity165 government would have to submit the lunar landing site to the @entity199 and ask that it is made a @entity200			0
ms @entity171 and mr @entity173 are members of the @entity203 , @entity204 , and @entity202 .			0

the first mission to the moon 's south pole is being planned by the @entity8 and @entity11
they plan on installing a radio antenna and optical telescope on the rim of the @entity21 crater to get clearer pictures of the @entity216
the mission is planned for 2016 and the companies believe the location could also be an ideal place for humans to settle on the moon
