by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 admits he got frustrated by the constant talk of @entity3 returning to the @entity5 squad ahead of the @entity6			1
@entity1 , who has finally recovered from a hamstring injury , has never been on the losing side for @entity5 in 10 starts alongside @entity10			1
nevertheless , there had been calls for @entity3 , who retired from international duty in september 2012 , to make himself available for @entity14			1
@entity15 : @entity16 pair @entity1 and @entity17 train with @entity5 at @entity18 thumbs up : @entity1 looked in good spirits as @entity5 prepared for friday 's friendly with @entity20 the @entity16 centre half admitted : ' it 's difficult			1
i ca n't say i like to hear it , but i understand why i do			0
' obviously @entity10 and @entity3 play together at @entity25 , they play in the @entity26 and were contenders to win the @entity28			1
' as a defender , partnerships are important			2
if you have two players who work well together they may be a better bet than two superior players , so i can understand why people talk about @entity3			1
' @entity5 's defence in the qualifiers was pretty decent , but i ca n't decide what people ask			2
i stop , smile and get on with it			0
' @entity3 , 33 , has always insisted he would never come out of international retirement and head coach @entity40 has n't even discussed it with him			2
first choice : @entity1 and @entity10 look the likely to be the centre back pairing for @entity5 at the @entity6 club class : @entity10 and @entity3 have formed a defensive partnership at @entity25 although @entity5 's defence does look vulnerable , @entity1 and @entity10 will be @entity40 's first pick at the @entity6 this summer			1
the @entity16 defender has won 31 caps and is expected to face @entity20 in @entity5 's @entity6 send - off at @entity52 on friday evening			1
he added : ' i still find it difficult assuming i 'm going to play for @entity5 but i 've played quite a lot in qualifying and have built up a good relationship with @entity10			1
' we have n't played together for a while and hopefully these three games will give us the chance to get that relationship going again			2
being in the squad is great , but nothing beats starting games for your country			2
it 's what we all want to do and it looks like i 've got a good chance of doing that at the moment			0
' getting down to business : @entity5 players @entity75 and @entity1 try and stop @entity76 from scoring @entity1 also mounted an impassioned defence of young @entity80 footballers after monitoring the progress of @entity16 midfielder @entity82 , plus @entity76 and @entity83 this season			1
the @entity5 defender watched @entity87 striker @entity86 on loan at @entity16 last season and claims he is no better than young @entity80 players			1
he added : ' @entity86 came in and he was quite a selfish player but he has a tremendous amount of ability and went past people			0
we are probably taught to be less selfish but technically there is no difference			0
young stars : @entity76 and @entity86 both had good seasons on @entity99 ' the ideal comparison is @entity76 to @entity101 and for me @entity76 had the best season			1
that is a direct comparison			0
' it is too easy to point the finger but if you take a step back to what we have got , we have some tremendously talented individuals			0
' if you look at @entity82 , he has a good physique , is good in the air , eats the right food , and more importantly loves the game			2
you can not get him off the training ground			0
he had a couple of injuries when he was younger which set him back a bit and he did not get to play that much football because he was not around the first team at a young age			0
looking good : @entity82 is one of the young @entity5 stars picked for the @entity6 ' this season has proved how much he has grown mentally			1
he went through a bad period but the manager stood by him and he came out of it			0
he has got the whole package , but we do n't want to put too much pressure on him			0
' people compare him to @entity136 but they are not the same players			0
in terms of mindset , they are the same			0
' @entity1 missed three months of the season with a hamstring injury , but finally returned to the @entity16 team for the 3 - 2 defeat against @entity144 on may 3			1
he added : ' i do n't feel 100 per cent sharp but training with these extra layers on is perfect			0
i can only improve and hopefully if i can get some time on the pitch in these three games i 'll soon be a lot fitter			2

@entity1 *confident* he and @entity10 will be able to fill the void left by @entity3
@entity1 and @entity10 are *unbeaten* for @entity5 in the 10 games they have played together
