by @entity0 published : 19:06 est , 5 january 2014 updated : 05:57 est , 6 january 2014 pressure : @entity3 is expected to reveal general sales fell by 1.5 per cent despite 30 per cent discounts @entity6 boss @entity3 will come under mounting pressure this week following another dismal @entity8 for the high street giant			1
the company is expected to reveal that sales of general merchandise including clothes fell 1.5per cent in the crucial festive period despite discounts of up to 30 per cent			1
that is far worse than the 0.5 per cent slide analysts had predicted and will trigger renewed speculation over mr @entity3 ’s future as chief executive			1
the results , due to be published on thursday , will confirm that @entity6 was one of the big losers on the high street for a third @entity8 in a row			1
@entity26 , a retail analyst at stock broker @entity28 , said : ‘ there was a cautious expectation they were about to turn the corner but it does n’t look like they have turned much if at all			2
’ @entity34 issued a severe profits warning on @entity36 as it became the first high profile casualty of the festive season			2
@entity39 and @entity40 are also expected to release disappointing figures this week			1
but other retailers have fared far better including @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
the success of rival stores - and particularly next where sales jumped 11.9 per cent between november 1 and december 24 - will only serve to highlight just how badly @entity6 is doing			1
annual profits at @entity44 this year are set to beat those at @entity6 for the first time			0
the expected 1.5 per cent fall in clothing sales at @entity6 in the 13 weeks to december 28 is even worse than the 1.3 per cent decline suffered in the previous three months			1
food sales are thought to have risen 2 per cent but overall total sales look set to be flat at best			1
the much - lauded autumn / winter clothing ranges , marketed by a major poster campaign featuring @entity58 , have failed to revive the company ’s fortunes			1
experts thought the high street chain was on the brink of changed fortunes but the new figures disprove that @entity6 was forced into heavy discounting in an attempt to win back shoppers including its much - heralded ‘ @entity69 ’ on the saturday before @entity8 when the price of clothing lines was slashed by up to 30 per cent			2
sales of general merchandise have already declined for nine quarters in a row			2
but mr @entity3 , who has been chief executive since 2010 , has denied that the success of the latest autumn / winter ranges , the first from a new clothing team , will make or break his stewardship of the company			0
he has insisted that the company is on the right track now that decades of under - investment are being addressed and it is thought that investors are willing to give mr @entity3 more time for his turn - around to bear fruit			0
@entity90 commentator @entity89 , of stock broker @entity91 , said mr @entity3 ’s position as chief executive ‘ must be vulnerable ’			0
he said : ‘ the problems are with the fashion , which remains dowdy and without flair			0
the shops are still poorly laid out			0
fund managers will run out of patience but will give him another three months			0
