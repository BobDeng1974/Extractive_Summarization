the taxman is facing fresh embarrassment after it emerged that thousands more workers were sent tax statements that were in fact incorrect			1
the blunder comes at a time when @entity7 is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers ’ bank accounts			1
every year , around five million workers are found to have under or overpaid through the pay as you earn system			1
@entity16 blunder : @entity7 has admitted some of the five million workers who received an incorrect tax bill in 2013/14 may have again received a ' miscalculated ' bill this can be for a variety of reasons , including because they have moved jobs or taken a second income			1
the government must contact each one with a new tax statement telling them how much they must either claw back , by changing their tax code , or how much they must reimburse them			1
now @entity7 , which has a history of blunders , has admitted thousands of these were miscalculated – an error they were alerted to after being contacted by concerned workers			1
it said ‘ thousands ’ of statements sent out to customers showed ‘ an incorrect overpayment or underpayment ’ during 2013 - 14			2
in an email sent to accountants and staff , it added : ‘ we currently do not know the scale of the issue , but some large employers are involved , so several thousands of employees may be affected			2
’ @entity7 advised recipients of the email to tell taxpayers who questioned their bills ‘ not to repay any underpayment ’ – and not to cash any cheques reimbursing them until the error had finally been rectified			2
the leaked letter said they were ‘ very sorry ’ about the incorrect calculations and they were ‘ urgently investigating these cases ’			0
revealed : a memo sent to senior staff at @entity7 , based in central @entity64 , ( pictured ) admitted that mistakes had been made the miscalculations are believed to have been caused by incomplete information from employers – something the @entity27 had hoped to limit through its new £ 270million ‘ @entity72 ’ ( @entity70 ) programme			1
the system forces employers to report the amount of money paid to staff on a more frequent weekly or monthly basis , in a bid to ensure changes to employees ’ status are quickly updated			0
but experts said the latest mishap showed there were still major flaws with the system			0
@entity87 , chief executive of financial advice firm @entity88 , said : ‘ this is very bad timing for @entity7			0
‘ they should only be given more powers if they can prove they can confidently deliver accurate information			0
this clearly calls into question their ability to do so and their faith in the real - time system			0
’ @entity100 , of the @entity101 , said it was further evidence that the ‘ real - time ’ system had been implemented too quickly without sufficient planning or resources			0
bad timing : the blunder comes at a time when @entity7 is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers ’ bank accounts he added : ‘ yet again , we are seeing errors in the operation of @entity118			1
public patience is wearing thin with government it failures and one like this , which hits so close to home for taxpayers , is bad news for a department trying to extend the reach of its powers into every aspect of our collective financial lives based on the power of its computer systems			0
’ the @entity135 has outlined a string of new powers for @entity7 in recent months in a bid to clamp down on tax avoidance			2
this includes a controversial proposal to allow the taxman to raid people ’s bank accounts for money owed without gaining permission from a court first			2
the ‘ direct recovery of debt ’ would enable @entity7 to confiscate unpaid tax direct from the bank and building society accounts of debtors who owe at least £ 1,000 and who have been contacted at least four times by @entity7 to pay			1
the taxman would leave at least £ 5,000 in debtors ’ bank accounts			2
a spokesman for @entity7 said : ‘ the majority of the errors have happened because an employer failed to make a final payment statement for the 2013 - 14 tax year , meaning our records were incomplete despite reminders that these submissions had to be made			1
‘ we are sorry this has happened and we aim to issue corrected calculations in the next few weeks			0
’ he said no one had been asked ‘ for a penny ’ as a result of the error and they would receive a new statement within six to eight weeks			0
while @entity7 did not yet know how many people had been affected , it would be fewer than 100,000 , the spokesman added .			0
