@entity0 looks ahead to the second @entity2 game at @entity3 this season as the @entity5 take on the @entity6			1
@entity5 head into the game in with a 5 - 2 record atop the @entity10 , and they ’ll be looking for another win against a @entity6 team that have lost their last four games			1
everyone knows that the @entity6 are struggling with their offensive line and that is going to be a major issue at @entity3 on sunday			1
the @entity5 have the no 1 defense in the league and are only conceding 15 points per game			1
this could be a blowout by the @entity5 , but it could be a close game if the @entity6 defense can step up to the mark			1
the @entity6 have been struggling with their offensive line ahead of the clash with the @entity5 @entity5 vs @entity6 , 1.30pm @entity28 at @entity29 , 5pm @entity30 at @entity31 , 5pm @entity32 at @entity33 , 5pm @entity34 at @entity35 , 5pm @entity36 at @entity37 , 5pm @entity38 at @entity39 , 5pm @entity40 at @entity41 , 5pm @entity42 at @entity43 , 5pm @entity44 at @entity45 , 8.05pm @entity46 at @entity47 , 8.25pm @entity48 at @entity49 , 8.25pm @entity50 at @entity51 , 12.30am @entity5 have a formidable force up front on defense			1
when you watch the game live on @entity57 at 1.30pm , make sure you look out for defensive tackle @entity58			0
i was fortunate enough to meet him this week at an @entity62 event at @entity63 and he is a monster			2
he is nearly 23 stone of pure muscle and three times as wide as i am			0
i ’m 6 ’ 4 ” and weigh 221lbs , but this guy literally dwarfed me and put me in a shadow as big as a solid oak tree			0
@entity6 quarterback @entity72 will have to establish his passing game early but , because of the amount of pressure that @entity58 and @entity76 are putting on quarterbacks , the @entity5 defensive backs are having a field day			1
the @entity5 have had 21 sacks and eight interceptions so far this season			1
this sunday is the first time ever that an @entity62 regular - season game will start as early as 9.30am @entity84			1
i ’ve been fortunate enough to be at functions where the @entity62 have really played on the fact that we have an early kick - off			2
it is something they want to experiment with and see if there ’s a market and an audience for a breakfast game in the @entity95			0
if it gets good viewing figures , we may see future @entity100 games being midday or 1pm kick - offs			1
@entity103 is doubtful for the game and it will be a massive coup for the @entity62 if he plays on the hallowed turf at @entity3			1
he is a superstar and was on the cover of the game @entity109 , which is always a sign of respect			0
@entity103 is tall , strong powerful and can run like the wind			1
he studies opposition so well to the point where he can manipulate them with the way he moves			0
@entity103 is a doubt for the clash at @entity3 but it will be a massive coup should he play on sunday i spoke to @entity5 quarterback @entity120 this week			1
i said to him : ‘ no disrespect , but if i was @entity5 quarterback i would just throw the ball in @entity103 ’s direction			1
’ @entity120 was laughing and said ‘ absolutely , that ’s all i do			0
’ everyone thought @entity103 would be a massive loss for the @entity5 but his replacements @entity128 and @entity129 have really stepped up to the mark			1
what is opening people ’s eyes is that the @entity5 have proved they can be successful without @entity103			1
at running back , @entity134 seems to have settled and @entity136 is taking the workload off him too			0
their quarterback @entity120 is a former first - round draft pick and has high expectations on his shoulders			2
he said this week that the transition of having a new head coach ( @entity143 ) is always difficult , but everyone seems to have knuckled down as a team			2
you have to tip your cap to coach @entity143 and the offense for being so successful without @entity103			1
@entity128 ( pictured against @entity149 ) has stepped up in the absence of ' @entity103 ' for the @entity5 everyone thought they were a one - threat team , but who knows what is going to happen when @entity103 comes back … hopefully this week at @entity3			1
the @entity6 are struggling at 2 - 5 and i feel sorry for quarterback @entity72			1
he was expected to have a phenomenal year but they have had such a slow start with injuries and key players out on the offensive line			0
but they are still in the mix in the @entity163			0
it is a division that is really lacking in consistency and being led by a @entity29 team at 3 - 3 - 1			2
i think it ’s going to be a really close - fought division , but i would n’t count out the @entity169			2
each team in this division needs to get some momentum going			0
if whoever wins it ends up at 8 - 8 , they ’re not going to go much further than @entity174 weekend			2
what to watch out for at @entity3 1			1
we are going to be in for a serious aerial bombardment			0
we have got two great quarterbacks who have established themselves in the @entity62 and can both throw the football in @entity120 and @entity72			0
if @entity103 does n’t play , look out for @entity128			1
he is a former @entity28 seahawk and won a @entity181 ring last year			0
@entity128 ’s arrival has helped the @entity5 establish another aerial threat outside of @entity103			1
anyone who loves sport for the athleticism of the game , look out for @entity188			0
the man is absolutely huge			0
when he puts his shoulder down , it is very difficult for defenders to stop him			0
i ’m excited to see how he can run the ball			0
@entity196 the @entity50 visit the @entity169 in the late game on @entity57 on sunday			2
the @entity169 are struggling , but it is always a joy to watch @entity200			0
but the @entity50 are flying at the moment and , if @entity202 can do what he has been doing in previous games , this will be a two - score win for @entity50			2
last week there was a really positive debate on my @entity209 feed about what defines the best quarterback			2
@entity213 has defined himself as the best quarterback the league has ever seen from a statistical point of view - but he has only got one @entity181 ring			2
@entity202 is definitely in the group just below @entity213 and my favourite @entity218			0
what he brings to the team is an air of calmness			0
he is a real leader , but from a different angle			0
he uses a relaxed approach to the game and just lets his skills do the talking			0
@entity0 presents @entity62 : the @entity227 , mondays at 11.50pm on @entity57			0
this sunday , @entity57 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity5 vs @entity6 from @entity3 , as well as the @entity50 against the @entity169 .			1

@entity5 face @entity6 at @entity3 on sunday *afternoon*
@entity231 is second @entity2 *contest* of the season
@entity103 limited in practice and still an injury doubt
@entity6 have lost their last four games and enter week eight with 2 - 5 record
