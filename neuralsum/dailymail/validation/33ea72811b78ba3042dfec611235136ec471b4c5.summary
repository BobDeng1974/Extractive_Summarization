polar bears are suffering potentially harmful changes to their brains due to the accumulation of pollution in the arctic , according to a new study			1
scientists have found that key processes in the brains of polar bears are being disrupted by man - made chemicals such as stain repellents and water - proofing treatments			1
they claim this could result in changes to polar bear behaviour and hormone balance that may ultimately affect their ability to survive			1
as an apex predator , pollutants in the food of polar bears , like the one above , can accumulate in their tissues the pollutants , known as perfluoroalkly compounds , accumulate in specific areas of polar bears ' brains over years of eating contaminated food			1
the chemicals get into the oceans from run - off from landfill and gradually filter up through the food chain , buidling up in the largest predators			0
a team of scientists have recently reported that chemical pollutants accumulating in the @entity40 may be reducing the density of the bones in the penises of male polar bears			1
the researchers from @entity46 in @entity47 found that polychlorinated biphenyls ( @entity49 ) are associated with a less dense penile bone			2
they have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens , which include @entity49 , in their bodies , have smaller than average penis bones and testes			2
organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine , and are used as solvents and pesticides , as well as in the making of dyes and drugs			0
pcbs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s , but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer			0
the researchers warn that the presence of such chemicals , which tend to accumulate over time in the bodies of top predators from the prey they eat , may have disastrous consequences for polar bear mating			1
as polar bears are the apex predator in the @entity40 , they build up relatively high concentrations of these chemicals			2
the researchers found that areas of polar bears ' brains where levels of perfluoroalkyl substances ( @entity92 ) were highest also had disrupted levels of enzyme activity			1
however , the exact effect the pollution is having on bear behaviour has still to be explored			0
@entity98 , a toxicologist at the @entity99 who led the research , said : although @entity102 have been increasing in the @entity40 , and in particular in @entity104 polar bears , over the past three decades , several of the most dominant @entity102 have started to decline around 2007			1
' however relatively high levels have recently been found in polar bear brains ' results from our study support the hypothesis that pfas concentrations in polar bears from @entity104 have exceeded the threshold limits for neurochemical alterations			1
' given the importance of these systems in cognitive process and motor function , the present results indicate an urgent need for a better understanding of neurochemical effects of @entity92 exposure to wildlife			0
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity128 , examined the brains of nine polar bears that had been killed by hunters in @entity104			1
they then measured the levels of @entity133 in different regions of the brain and compared them to levels of enzyme activity there			0
researchers found pollutants were associated with lower levels of neurotransmitters in polar bear brain tissue the highest levels of @entity92 were highest in the brain stem , which controls vital life functions , and the cerebellum , which is responsble for coordinating movement and balance			1
they found that in particular perfluorooctane sulfonate ( @entity152 ) , which is as a strain repellent treatment for fabrics , and perfluorinated carboxylic acid , which are used to make non-stick coatings , were associated with changes to key neurotransmitters in the bear 's brains			1
these neurotransmitters are known to be important for behaviour , learning and memory			0
professor @entity164 , another scienitist at the @entity99 who was also involved in the study , told @entity168 : ' we do n't know whether the disruption of enzymes and signal substances is enough to have an effect on the polar bears ' senses and behaviour			1
@entity152 ( @entity152 ) , the chemical structure of which is shown above , was widely used as a stain repellent and protector for fabrics but has been found to accumulate within the bodies of top marine predators ' the brain is plastic and may adapt itself and compensate for the damage to a certain extent			0
' it 's difficult to say whether we are a long way from the limit , or very close to it			0
' it ’s the fundamental processes vital to being a bear that can potentially be disturbed by the substances			0
' it is not the first time pollution has been found to be taking a toll on polar bears			1
last year researchers warned that the accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls ( @entity49 ) may be causing the penis bones of male polar bears to become weaker			2
climate scientists have also warned that as the habitat used by the predators changes due to climate change , the animals will face increasing challenges to their survival			0
scientists recently warned that a a quarter of @entity215 polar bears could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps			2
warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear ’s habitat , affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food			0
biologists from the @entity227 believe that as summers get warmer in the @entity230 off the @entity232 continent and @entity104 – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year			0
scientists have warned that a quarter of @entity215 polar bears ( pictured ) could be wiped out by the end of the century because of shrinking ice caps			2
warming temperatures could destroy one tenth of the bear ’s habitat , affecting their ability to roam across huge expanses of ice to hunt for food and mate this means that by 2100 , each polar bear population in the @entity243 may have to endure between two and five months of the year without ice at sea , which would likely lead to starvation and hamper their ability to mate			2
projected global warming would adversely affect one tenth of their habitat , which is being damaged by man - made pollution , according to the study			0
it found that sea ice across the @entity40 is declining and altering the physical characteristics of marine ecosystems the study , published in @entity258 , used sea ice projections from 2006 to 2100 to gain an insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears			2
biologists believe that as summers get warmer in the @entity243 ( mapped ) - islands off the @entity232 continent and @entity104 – more permanent ice cover will melt away every year			0

researchers at @entity99 studied polar bear brain tissue
they found perfluoroalkyl pollutants accumulated in the animals ' brains
higher levels were associated with lower levels of key neurotransmitters
these may impact on the behaviour and hormone levels in polar bears
