by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 14:23 est , 11 april 2013 an @entity2 scientist claims he has invented a time machine that allows you to predict the future with 98 per cent accuracy			1
@entity7 says his device can produce a print - out detailing any individual 's life between five and eight years in advance after taking readings from the touch of a user			1
he claims the @entity2 government , whose nuclear programme has caused concern around the world , can use his invention to predict military conflicts and forecast the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and oil			1
not quite the @entity26 yet : an @entity2 scientist has claimed to have invented a time machine , but unlike the car ( above ) in @entity31 it produces a print - out detailing a person 's life ahead rather than actually taking them anywhere he says the device is the size of a laptop and uses a complex set of algorithms which took him ten years to develop , but has not revealed any concrete details about his invention			1
unlike the time - travelling @entity26 in hit film @entity31 , mr @entity7 said his device ' will not take you into the future , it will bring the future to you			2
' he told the @entity49 state news agency : ' my invention easily fits into the size of a personal computer case and can predict details of the next five to eight years of the life of its users			1
' naturally a government that can see five years into the future would be able to prepare itself for challenges that might destabilise it			2
fates of the state : @entity64 claims his device can be used by warmongering @entity2 president @entity65 ( above ) to predict military conflicts and future values of currencies and oil ' as such , we expect to market this invention among states as well as individuals once we reach a mass production stage			1
' mr @entity7 , who claims he has 179 inventions listed under his name , has been criticised by friends and family for ' trying to play @entity79			2
' but he said : ' this project is not against our religious values at all			0
' the @entity83 are trying to make this invention by spending millions of dollars on it where i have already achieved it by a fraction of the cost , ' he said , without divulging how much			0
he said @entity2 was not planning to launch the prototype just yet in case ' the @entity92 will steal the idea and produce it in millions overnight '			1
doctored ? @entity2 faced accusations that its much - heralded new fighter jet could even fly and that this picture of it soaring over mountains had been superimposed in @entity99 @entity2 has been ridiculed in recent months after attempting to showcase its technological advances only to face accusations they were faked			0
in february , it proudly unveiled a stealth fighter jet at a ceremony attended by president @entity65 , but experts quickly expressed serious doubts about whether it could even fly			0
a picture of the domestically produced @entity111 apparently soaring over @entity2 mountains did little to curb scepticism amid claims the plane never actually left the ground , but was simply doctored using @entity99			0
critics also believe @entity2 's claims that it launched a monkey into space could have been faked			0
scientists in @entity122 hailed the mission to send a simian 75 miles above @entity124 and back in a @entity126 rocket as a success			0
but question marks were raised after the monkey presented to the nation as the heroic astronaut looked remarkably different than the one which made lift off .			0

@entity7 , *27* , claims device can detail person 's life with 98 *%* accuracy
spent ten years developing complex algorithms to arrive at predictions
says his warmongering government can use it to predict military conflicts
wo *n't* release prototype yet ' in case @entity92 steals it and produces millions '
