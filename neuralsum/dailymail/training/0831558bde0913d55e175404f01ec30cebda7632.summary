the big news dominating the transfer agenda is the announcement by @entity3 that they have agreed a deal to sign @entity6 teenage sensation @entity5 in a £ 2.3million deal			1
at just 16 , @entity5 had been tracked by some of @entity10 's top clubs - and trained with both @entity11 and @entity12 - before agreeing to move to @entity3 from @entity13 , in the process signing a contract worth £ 80,000 a week			1
here , @entity16 takes a look at 10 other teenage sensations who the top clubs in @entity10 at keeping their eyes on ... @entity5 ( centre ) , 16 , has signed for @entity3 for £ 2.3million , subject to a medical @entity5 celebrates scoring for @entity24 in @entity6 in may 2014 at the age of just 15 more than 30 clubs around @entity10 had been fighting for the signature of the 16 - year - old wonderkid @entity29 ( 18 , @entity30 ) there seems to be an almost never - ending list of talented footballers coming through the @entity35 youth system , and @entity29 is just the latest of those			1

he made his debut for @entity30 at the age of just 17 years , four months and 25 days against @entity44 in the @entity45 - a club record - and has scored regularly at every single level of @entity35 youth international football			1
@entity29 ( left ) is a @entity35 under 19 international and is regarded as one of @entity10 's top youngsters @entity29 has excelled for @entity30 and became their youngster scorer aged 17 years , four months and 25 days mosquito ( 19 , @entity54 ) not a normal name for a footballer i 'll grant you but @entity59 @entity53 - excelled during last summer 's @entity60 when the @entity62 under 20 side took home the trophy			1
he is just 19 but has been involved with the @entity62 set - up for more than five years , first alerting @entity67 clubs to his talent when he netted 10 goals in seven matches at the @entity71			1
a move to @entity54 from @entity73 followed and he has already found the back of the net for the @entity77 side			0
expect a move across the @entity79 soon ... @entity53 ( left ) celebrates scoring for @entity62 during the @entity80 in 2013 the @entity54 striker is just 19 and has been involved in the @entity62 set - up and more than five years @entity83 ( 18 , @entity84 on loan from @entity86 ) @entity83 - @entity88 's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days and @entity90 's youngster goalscorer ( after breaking @entity92 's record no less )			1
inevitably comparisons have been made with @entity92 , @entity90 's greatest striker , and @entity83 was even first spotted at his idol 's footballing academy			1
@entity86 bought the 18 - year - old in 2009 and , after spending last season at @entity101 , the striker is now on loan at @entity103 in @entity104 where he is honing his skills			0
interestingly , his nickname is ' @entity107 ' due to his magnificent dribbling skills and his love of dancing ... @entity83 of @entity90 kicks the ball during a training season at the @entity80 in @entity62 the 18 - year - old @entity86 winger , pictured on loan at @entity101 , is @entity90 's youngest - ever scorer @entity115 ( 19 , @entity116 ) @entity117 are n't short of an exciting player or two at the moment and @entity115 is expected to be the country 's next great export			2
the 19 - year - old plies his trade for @entity116 in @entity124 and the attacking midfielder has established a pretty impressive strike ratio - he has netted 22 times in 96 matches for his club			0
@entity115 's super-quick acceleration , superb control and instinctive finishing have made him one of the most - sought after attacking midfielders in world football			2
@entity115 ( left ) playing for the @entity137 side during the @entity77 tournament the @entity116 midfielder has netted an impressive 22 times in 96 appearances for the club @entity143 ( 18 , @entity144 ) @entity144 have been pumping money into their academy in recent years and forward @entity143 is expected to be one of the success stories to emerge from this big cash injection			0
the forward excelled for @entity144 during their pre-season tour of the @entity152 - scoring against @entity153 - and contributed seven assists and six goals for the @entity157 @entity80 side during their victorious 2013 @entity80 campaign			0
@entity159 has even commented on @entity143 's talent , explaining : ' @entity143 is an exciting player			2
i love the way he plays and i feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future			0
' praise indeed ! @entity143 ( left ) crosses the ball for @entity144 against @entity170 last july the @entity144 academy striker is regarded as a huge prospect by first - teamer @entity159 @entity174 ( 19 , @entity12 ) the @entity176 winger needs no introduction to @entity179 fans and , despite a difficult start to @entity182 's reign at @entity12 , @entity174 remains one of the hottest prospects in @entity185			2
at 19 , @entity174 has already scored four times for the @entity12 first - team and burst on to the scene when he netted twice in his first start for the club against @entity191 in october 2013			0
with six @entity193 caps to his name too , @entity174 may well look for pastures new if @entity196 will not give him game time at @entity198 - and he will certainly not be short of potential suitors , that 's for sure			2
@entity174 ( centre ) celebrates scoring for @entity12 against @entity202 in december 2013 the @entity193 international has struggled for game time under @entity182 but is highly regarded @entity174 broke on to the @entity179 scene when he scored against @entity191 in october 2013 @entity206 ( 19 , @entity207 ) @entity207 may be enduring a turbulent spell off the field right now but the @entity210 have arguably their best crop of youngsters in a generation - most notably the exciting talent that is @entity206			1
the 19 - year - old @entity215 - born winger has only made five first - team appearances since his debut earlier this season - largely due to recurring hamstring problems - but he is already courted by a number of top @entity179 sides after scoring twice			2
his pace , trickery and directness have already drawn comparisons with @entity225 and his brilliant goal against @entity144 in the @entity227 proved his potential			0
@entity207 love watching players of @entity206 ' talent - but @entity207 need to make sure they can keep hold of him			1
@entity206 ( centre ) celebrates scoring for @entity207 against @entity144 in the @entity227 the @entity215 - born winger beats @entity235 ( right ) before slotting past @entity236 @entity206 ( left ) celebrates scoring for @entity207 against @entity237 in august of last year @entity238 ( 19 , @entity239 ) one of the surprise transfers of last summer was @entity238 's £ 3m move from @entity242 to @entity239			1
the attacking midfielder had scored nine times in 50 appearances for @entity242 before @entity153 came calling for the @entity248 @entity247 starlet			0
he has since found himself largely playing for @entity153 's b side but , after impressing , he made his @entity251 debut for the first team earlier this month			2
@entity248 believe they have a real talent of the future on their hands - can gauld fulfil his true potential ? @entity238 completed a £ 3m move from @entity242 to @entity239 last summer the attacking midfielder ( centre ) made his @entity251 debut against @entity262 earlier this month @entity263 ( 18 , @entity264 ) the one - cap @entity176 international was subject to interest from @entity88 champions @entity267 last summer , such is @entity263 's talent			1
a quick , tricky and in many ways unorthodox winger , @entity263 made the short move to @entity264 in @entity272 from @entity273 in his homeland in 2006			0
the 18 - year - old netted four times for @entity264 last season but , after failing to secure a move to @entity54 , he was banished to the @entity281 side 's reserves for refusing to sign a new contract			0
@entity54 and their fellow @entity67 giants will almost certainly return for the @entity285 - born youngster			0
@entity263 , pictured playing for @entity264 against @entity286 , is just 18 years of age the @entity193 international has been banished to the @entity264 reserves for refusing to sign a new deal @entity291 ( 19 , @entity292 ) you know how i said @entity29 was @entity35 's next big talent ? yeah well , about that - @entity291 may run him close you know ... at just 19 , the @entity292 midfielder was named in @entity299 's provisional squad for @entity35 's victorious @entity80 campaign last year before being cut for the final 23 - but he is regarded by both his national and club coaches as a future heartbeat of their sides			1
having moved to @entity292 from @entity304 in 2013 - where he was described by coach @entity305 as ' the talent of the century ' - @entity291 has developed his game to become a classy midfielder who is tactically astute , positionally aware and who can rocket in a shot from the edge of the area			0
not bad for a guy who has n't turned 20 yet , is it ? @entity291 ( left ) of @entity292 beats the challenge of two @entity318 players in may 2014 the 19 - year - old @entity35 international has been described as ' the talent of the century ' by his former coach			0

@entity5 has signed for @entity3 at the age of just 16
@entity6 moves to @entity326 winners in £ 2.3million deal
