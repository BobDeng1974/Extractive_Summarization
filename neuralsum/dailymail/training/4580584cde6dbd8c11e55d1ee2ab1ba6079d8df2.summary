a strange reenactment of a replica of a big whale being harpooned has been used as a source of entertainment at a festival in @entity6			0
hundreds of people turned up to watch the bizarre display at the @entity9 in @entity10 on sunday where locals dressed in nothing but red loin cloths and headbands pretending to be traditional whalers hunting down the mock - up whale			1
people of all ages were engrossed by the performance where the make - believe whalers speared the fake mammal , threw a net over it and tied ropes around it before rowing the whale into the shore			1
the hunters are then seen dragging the supposed whale onto dry land before carrying a stuffed toy whale on a plank of wood above their heads - much to the joy of the onlookers who were cheering and clapping - as the unconvincing replica was taken to where the ceremony began			2
the ' traditional whalers ' then sat cross legged facing the toy whale and proceeded to sing and continuously raise their hands in the air while drums were banging during the ritual			0
the thoroughly entertained crowd clapped enthusiastically as the peculiar performance came to an end			0
