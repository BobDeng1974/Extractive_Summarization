sneaky tactics used by airlines , banks and insurance companies to trick millions of customers into buying extra insurance could soon be outlawed			2
the @entity7 watchdog has said it wants to ban companies from ‘ opt out ’ selling – where customers have to untick a box in the small print if they want to avoid buying an add - on insurance policy			2
in a damning report , the @entity13 said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need			1
the @entity13 said many customers are being tricked into buying products they do not want or need those that fall into the trap - whether they are buying a concert ticket or paying for car insurance - are more likely to buy inappropriate products , or receive poor value for money			1
the @entity13 estimates the scam is costing customers more than £ 108 million a year in overpayments			1
the market for such products - including identity theft protection , home insurance and breakdown cover – is worth an estimated £ 1billion a year to the insurance industry			1
they are typically sold alongside insurance such as travel , car and home cover			1
but just under a fifth of customers are not even aware they have them , according to the @entity13			2
the sale of add - on products has already given rise to the payment protection insurance mis - selling scandal , where millions of customers were sold policies they did not want or need alongside loans or credit cards			1
high street banks and other lenders have paid out £ 18billion in compensation so far – making it the most expensive mis - selling scandal in @entity59 history			0
the sneaky tactics are used by airlines and banks with products - including identity theft protection , home insurance and breakdown cover - typically sold alongside travel and car insurance and home cover @entity69 , director of strategy and competition at the @entity13 said : ‘ this is about ensuring consumers can make the right decision on what add - on insurance they do or do n’t need			1
forgetting to untick a box at the end of a purchase is not making an informed choice			0
’ similar tactics are used by firms to barrage customers with junk mail and marketing			0
the ban would apply to add - on sales of all products alongside financial primary policies - meaning the insurance policy or loan that the customer intended to buy in the first place			2
paying out : the @entity13 estimates the scam is costing customers more than £ 108 million a year in overpayments key examples include key cover sold alongside motor insurance , or protection cover when taking out a mortgage or credit card			1
the @entity7 watchdog also wants firms to inform customers about add - on policies earlier in the sales process – rather than just before they make the purchase - so they can make an informed choice and shop around			0
existing rules are already meant to protect customers who are buying an add - on financial policy alongside a non financial product such as a plane ticket			2
the sale of insurance add - ons is hugely lucrative , with insurance companies making bumper profits			0
according to a separate study by the @entity120 just 5pc of premiums collected from customers who take out personal injury insurance alongside motor insurance is paid out in claims			0
@entity126 , director of regulation at industry lobby group the @entity127 said it supported the proposed ban			0
it said : ‘ although the use of pre-ticked boxes is not widespread , these proposals will encourage all firms to make sure their customers are provided with appropriate information at an early stage			0
’ the @entity13 said it will consult with consumer groups and financial companies on the proposed changes until june 25 .			0
