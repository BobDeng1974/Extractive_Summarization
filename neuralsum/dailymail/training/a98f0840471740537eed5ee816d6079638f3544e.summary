by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:00 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 21:01 est , 27 december 2013 the benefits offered by conventional supermarket loyalty cards , such as @entity7 ’s @entity6 , are ‘ meaningless ’ to customers , a rival has claimed			1
the boss of @entity10 argues that shoppers want instant rewards , rather than points that are collected over months and then used to claim discounts on groceries and days out			1
@entity16 is speaking from a position of strength as @entity10 is putting on sales while the likes of @entity7 and @entity21 ’s , which both run points based loyalty cards , are losing market share			1
loyal : @entity16 from @entity10 claims supermarket loyalty cards like @entity21 's @entity27 are ' meaningless ' and shoppers want more instant benefits instead of collecting points for months and months he claims that shoppers prefer the benefits offered by the @entity33 card , which includes a daily free cup of coffee or newspaper			1
the offer of free coffee has been enormously popular with the chain ’s high street outlets now giving away around one million cups a day			2
but , while this has been good for @entity10 in terms of building customer loyalty , it has been a disaster for independent coffee shops , who have complained about losing vital trade			1
some have suggested they may make a formal complaint to the @entity50 because @entity10 is effectively using its financial muscle in a way that could put some small coffee shops out of business			2
mr @entity16 said he understood the free coffee deal has been ‘ disruptive ’ , however he insisted customers prefer it to the points earned with conventional supermarket loyalty cards			1
he said : ‘ giving free coffee or free newspapers is disruptive to the market , but i think that is what customers want , i do n’t think they want a point			2
offers : mr @entity16 claims that shoppers prefer the benefits offered by the @entity33 card , which includes a daily free cup of coffee or newspaper ‘ i mean , what is a point ? i think it ’s meaningless			1
it does n’t have the richness , it does n’t have the affinity you can gauge if you engage with your customers in a different way			0
‘ it is about what do consumers value today , not what did they value historically			0
so green shield stamps , or points , were a response to what happened post-war			0
i just do n’t think that is where the world is now			0
’ @entity7 ’s @entity6 was the brainchild of the chain ’s former boss , sir @entity94 , in the early 1990s and was instrumental in making it the @entity97 ’s biggest supermarket with a 30per cent share of grocery sales			1
as well as inspiring loyalty among shoppers , it provided @entity7 with a huge amount of information of the nation ’s shopping habits			2
as a result , it was able to tailor the range on offer in each supermarket to the tastes of local shoppers , so dramatically boosting sales			2
success : @entity7 ’s @entity6 was the brainchild of the chain ’s former boss , sir @entity94 , in the early 1990s and was instrumental in making it the @entity97 ’s biggest supermarket with a 30per cent share of grocery sales it was so successful that @entity21 ’s followed suit with its @entity27 , which has been credited with delivering an improvement in its fortunes			1
recent independent trading figures show @entity7 and , to a lesser extent , @entity21 ’s have lost market share over the past year			1
by contrast , @entity10 has seen an increase of 6.7per cent			2
however , it is debatable as to how much the different approach to loyalty cards has played in this shift in fortunes , the fastest growing supermarkets in the @entity97 are @entity132 , where sales are up 30.6per cent in a year , and @entity134 , where sales have jumped 15.5per cent			1
these no - frills retailers do not offer any kind of loyalty scheme , which can be expensive to run			0
rather they concentrate on keeping prices below those of the mainstream supermarkets			0
@entity7 ’s @entity6 has some 15million users , suggesting it remains popular with customers			0
chief executive , @entity146 , has made clear he is fully committed to the loyalty scheme			0
in fact , he said information gathered through the @entity6 is proving more useful than ever to , for example , target personalised promotions at customers surfing its website			0
for example , @entity6 spending data means that people who are known to be price sensitive will see website advertisements and promotions for the @entity160 range			0
there are also @entity162 which allow people to keep a check on how many points they have earned and how they can be used			0
mr @entity146 said : ‘ @entity6 will always be rooted in rewarding people for their loyalty to us			0

@entity16 from @entity10 says shoppers want instant rewards and not points collected over several months
@entity10 is increasing sales while @entity7 and @entity21 which both offer loyalty cards are losing market share
@entity33 card gives shoppers instant benefits including a free cup of coffee or a newspaper
