the right hand man of @entity2 leader @entity1 has been killed in a @entity4 airstrike in northern @entity5 , according to senior security officials			1
damaging blow : a key aide of @entity1 has been killed by a @entity4 airstrike over @entity10 , northern @entity5 according to security sources two days after video showing the execution of @entity15 was released , @entity4 warplanes struck a damaging blow at the heart of @entity2 in @entity10 , killing @entity18			1
and at the @entity21 summit in @entity22 this afternoon , secretary of state @entity19 was seen to quietly pass president @entity23 a note during an address by @entity27 prime minister @entity26 ,			2
after @entity26 finished speaking , members of the press pool were cleared from the conference hall while it has not been confirmed if @entity23 learned of @entity18 's death through @entity19 's note , the president was noticeably absent for the beginning of a meeting of the @entity37 later - on at the summit			1
a senior @entity5 security official confirmed the news of the deadly air strike to @entity41 and is the most significant blow against @entity2 since the @entity4 began action last month			1
@entity45 news quoted the @entity5 @entity46 to say @entity48 's aide perished along with an explosives expert and the military chief in nearby town @entity51			2
it has not been confirmed when the airstrike took place but on tuesday @entity4 military officials said a sortie against @entity2 militants in @entity5 damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles near the @entity59			1
the confirmation of the deadly strike demonstrates that the @entity4 is clearly targeting @entity2 's leadership and clarifies rumors circulating yesterday that @entity1 himself was killed in the raid			1
indeed , multiple sources , including former @entity5 army officers , told the @entity68 on wednesday that @entity1 had died in @entity69 after being seriously injured in an @entity5 or @entity4 airstrike in the north of @entity5			1
while the significance of @entity18 's death for @entity76 and @entity2 is not yet clear , the loss of his right - hand man can not be underestimated			1
the presence of @entity18 in @entity10 shows that @entity76 could be worried about losing @entity10 to a combination of @entity4 airstrikes and @entity81 and @entity5 counter attacks			1
sending his right - hand man there to oversee the fight would go a long way to confirming this , but regardless , @entity18 's death is a blow to the @entity2 hierarchy			1
indeed , world leaders , nervously eyeing a growing threat from @entity116 militants , are seeking to build a united front this week against the violent extremist group and keep it from creeping beyond its borders			0
yet international plans to counter the @entity116 group - with combined military might , diplomatic pressure on abetting partners and economic penalties - still pale in comparison to the extremists ' ruthlessness and command of the swath of land it controls across parts of northern @entity69 and @entity5			1
for the second time in as many weeks , @entity116 militants released a video showing the beheading of an @entity4 journalist , and governments from @entity27 to @entity139 to @entity140 warned of the potential of their citizens joining the fight - and then bringing the violence back home			1
' our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy @entity2 so that it 's no longer a threat , ' president @entity23 said wednesday during a visit to @entity151 , using an alternate acronym for the @entity116			0
he later headed to @entity22 for an annual meeting of leaders of the @entity21 military alliance			1
separately , during an appearance in @entity158 , vice president @entity156 declared that the @entity4 will pursue the militants to ' the gates of hell			2
' in @entity22 , @entity27 prime minister @entity26 said he was considering joining a nearly monthlong @entity4 airstrike campaign in @entity5 against the @entity116 group , adding to military aid that @entity163 has already approved			1
' we 'll always ask ourselves what is in our national interest , ' @entity26 said , according to @entity27 's @entity168 newspaper			0
' not ruling things out , but going forward in a deliberate , sensible , resolute way			0
' @entity26 and @entity23 collaborated on an op - ed piece published thursday in the @entity172 , writing , ' countries like @entity27 and @entity4 will not be cowed by barbaric killers			2
' and in the @entity176 , the @entity175 called for a coordinated international effort to tackle the ' global scourge ' of terrorism , raising particular concern about the threat posed by @entity116 fighters			0
airstrikes : the @entity4 launched raids on @entity10 on tuesday - although it is not clear if they killed @entity18 allies : @entity27 prime minister @entity26 talks with @entity4 president @entity23 on the first day of the @entity92 2014 at the @entity100 in @entity101 , in @entity22 might : the @entity4 began limited airstrikes against @entity2 positions in northern @entity5 in august after the terror group began to exercise control over large swathes of territory @entity195 : a convoy of vehicles and fighters from @entity2 move through @entity5 's @entity199			1
the @entity116 group holds roughly a third of @entity5 and @entity69 , including several strategically important cities like @entity203 and @entity10 in @entity5 and @entity204 in @entity69			2
it rules over a population of several million people with its strict interpretation of @entity210 law the heightened urgency reflected fears that the @entity116 was growing stronger in its quest to create a caliphate territory in the @entity176 and systematically kill any who resist			0
the group is considered even more merciless toward its enemies than the @entity220 terror network , and intelligence officials across the world warn that it may soon seek to seed its violence beyond its declared borders			0
so far , the @entity116 has beheaded two @entity4 journalists it held captive for what the militants called payback for more than 120 @entity4 airstrikes on its assets in northern @entity5 since aug. 8			1
journalists @entity231 and @entity15 were two of what the @entity233 has described as ' a few ' @entity4 still being held hostage by the group			2
the @entity116 also had threatened to kill a @entity27 man it is holding hostage			0
march : @entity2 fighters move through northern @entity5 in january on their way to conquering huge slabs of territory across @entity5 and @entity69 in a statement wednesday , a family spokesman said @entity15 dedicated his life to portraying the suffering of people in war zones , but was ' no hero			1
' the @entity116 group spearheaded an offensive in june , seizing vast swaths of northern @entity5 , including the country 's second largest city @entity10			1
in recent weeks the battle has raged between @entity4 backed forces and @entity2 for the @entity59 which controls water and electricity across northern @entity5			1
' @entity2 keeps trying to take it back , ' rear			0
admiral @entity260 , a @entity261 spokesman , said at a briefing tuesday			0
' as long as they continue to pose a threat to the facility we are going to continue to hit them , ' @entity260 said			0
each day @entity2 militants fight @entity5 and @entity81 forces backed by @entity4 airstrikes in the region			1
the @entity4 has launched dozens of airstrikes around the dam since @entity2 abandoned it to @entity5 and @entity81 forces in mid-august			1
the @entity4 fears not only the strategic significance of the dam for @entity2 , but also the catastrophic threat posed if the terror group attempts to blow up the dam and flood the surrounding region			2
family spokesman @entity280 told reporters gathered outside the family 's suburban @entity283 home that @entity15 ' tried to find good concealed in a world of darkness , ' and to give voice to the weak and suffering in the @entity289 world			0
@entity280 said @entity15 was ' no war junkie , ' but was drawn to the stories of the turbulent @entity176 , and his family has pledged to ' not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapon they possess - fear			2
' @entity15 , a 31 - year - old who freelanced for @entity299 and @entity300 magazines before he was captured in @entity69 a year ago , was also an @entity302 citizen			2
but his @entity304 faith and @entity302 citizenship were not widely known before his death - in part because @entity302 's military censor apparently kept a lid on the story for his safety - and his killers are not believed to have known about his background			0
in @entity315 , @entity23 administration officials maintained that the @entity4 will not launch a ground war against the @entity116 militants			2
but they stopped short of ruling out airstrikes against the group in its safe haven in @entity69 , as the @entity4 has resisted for years			2
@entity23 has ' been clear that we 're not going to be limited by geography , ' @entity233 spokeswoman @entity321 said			0
she described a range of actions being considered against the @entity116 , and noted that decisions and discussions were ongoing			0
over the past day , secretary of state @entity19 and other administration officials have reached out to leaders from @entity140 , the @entity175 , @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity139 , @entity332 and @entity302 to discuss how to combat the @entity116			0
@entity321 said the discussions focused on what each country might contribute - including weapons , humanitarian aid and other resources - and noted that some nations already have			0
@entity23 ' wants to build an international coalition , ' @entity321 said			0
' that 's not going to be overnight			0
we need capabilities from many countries			0
' the push also mirrors concerns that the @entity116 will lure foreigners to the fight - who will then return home to launch attacks			0
a compilation of government estimates shows more than 2,000 people with @entity356 passports have fought or are fighting in @entity69 and @entity5 , with most looking to join the @entity116 group .			0
