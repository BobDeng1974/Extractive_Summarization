as temperatures plummet , hats are the fashion must - have			1
but is slinging on a bobble hat as effortless as @entity4 makes it look ? how do you know if @entity8 ’s fedora will suit your face ? and who can carry off pompoms ? @entity12 , a 38 - year - old mother of two , road - tested the hottest styles to find out			1
trendy beanie @entity16 beanie , £ 10 , very.co.uk i ’ve seen so many people wearing bobble hats that i ’m convinced they must suit everyone			1
@entity22 , even @entity4 relaxed her cocktail - party - ready style to endorse the trend			1
her grey felt bobble number whispered laid - back luxury , and there ’s no doubt i could do with a bit of that on the school run			1
yet my first thought is ‘ tea cosy ’			1
my second , ‘ well , now i know what i ’d look like bald ’			1
i think the bobble is best left to the oval or oblong faces			1
mine is just too round			1
am i too old for this look ? well , if you look like you might have knitted it yourself , it ’s one to avoid			1
@entity45 leopard beret , £ 15 , @entity47 within seconds of trying the beret , i realise that there ’s no right way to wear it			1
pinch it to one side for a classic @entity54 look , plonk it on the back of your head , or pull it over your ears when it ’s really cold			1
it ’s one of the few hats that suits cropped styles as well as longer tresses , as it will always reveal some hair , and it ’s refreshingly low maintenance ; at the cinema , i simply roll it up and stick it in my bag			1
it ’s hard to imagine a time when the beret wo n’t seem chic			1
and at just £ 15 , it ’s a great investment			1
@entity76 @entity78 hat , £ 36 , rubyanded.co.uk the @entity79 know a thing or two about bone - chilling winters , so where better to take inspiration now that biting @entity85 temperatures and snow have arrived on our shores ? the @entity78 sits securely on my head , covers my ears , and heats me up faster than an electric blanket			1
it also goes with everything — transforming my scruffy @entity94 cover - up to something that could grace @entity97 ski slopes			1
even better , it ’s one of those rare finds that looks equally appropriate whether your style icon is @entity102 , @entity103 or , erm , the @entity104			2
@entity105 @entity107 floppy hat , £ 20 , @entity108 a good option for long , oblong faces , which sadly precludes me			2
a pity , because i can imagine swooshing around the shops in this with a poncho — it feels playful and on - trend			2
the brim is cleverly cut to give coy glimpses of your eyes without compromising your vision			2
fifteen years ago i ’d have played up the @entity122 vibe with a maxi dress , but now i ’d stick to a leather jacket			2
would i wear it in another 15 years ? probably not — i fear it would look too ‘ girly ’			2
brimming with style wide - brimmed hat , £ 28 , riverisland.com the widebrim hat is guaranteed to turn heads , so you wo n’t be surprised to learn that @entity132 is a fan			2
i love the drama of it , i love the suits everyone but under - used grey / blue colour			2
however , i ca n’t figure out when i would wear one			2
it would take only the slightest puff of wind to send it into orbit			0
that said , you ’d make an impressive entrance at a party — but one where you did n’t want to talk to anyone , as the brim constantly flops			0
@entity149 @entity151 cloche hat , £ 49 , jacques - vert.co.uk say cloche hat , and i envisage ingenue types like @entity153 — big , wide eyes peering up innocently from low - riding brims — both dramatic and demure			0
yet the image in the mirror is n’t alluring ; it ’s me in my dotage			0
the heavy brim shrouds my face and the cloche ’s dome shape pushes down on my eyes			0
i dare n’t go into the @entity164 in case they offer me my pension			0
never mind asking ‘ am i too old for this ? ’ everyone is too young to wear this			0
still tempted ? ask yourself ‘ am i a @entity172 dowager in a funeral scene ? ’ if the answer ’s no , move on			0
@entity175 @entity176 felt trilby , £ 39 , jigsaw - online.com this style of hat is the equivalent of a provocatively arched eyebrow , and @entity183 ’s trilby is a cheeky little number			1
at first glance the grey tweed and classic shape seem as @entity188 as a pinstripe suit , but when i pop it on , it ’s quite the attention seeker			0
the stiff , curved brim makes it impossible to wear at anything but a jaunty angle , and peering out from under it at my builder feels downright flirty			0
in fact , i reckon it would help you sail past the snootiest of doormen			0
and unlike some of the other styles , it requires zero fiddling			0
@entity207 pale pink fedora , £ 25 , marksandspencer.com this could be my secret weapon on bad wardrobe days			0
a fedora seems to work with everything and everyone , you just need a little attitude to pull it off			0
i love the way the wide brim elongates round and heartshaped faces like mine , not to mention how the blush pink colour flatters almost every skintone			0
the secret to wearing it is simple — you just plonk it straight on			0
as it frames my face so well , i ’d be reluctant to wear it without make - up			0
and the shallow crown encourages good posture — i immediately stand taller			0
just do n’t forget to pull your hair forward to avoid your ears poking out like elves from @entity237 .			0
