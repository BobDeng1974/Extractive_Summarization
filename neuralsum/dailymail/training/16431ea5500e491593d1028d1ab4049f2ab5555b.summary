by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 08:59 est , 18 june 2013 a predatory @entity2 child rapist has gone on the run after he was granted bail and allowed to keep his passport while awaiting trial			1
@entity7 attacked a 12 - year - old girl in a supermarket car park after grooming her for six months on the internet while posing as a 15 - year - old boy			1
@entity7 , 41 , skipped bail before he was due to stand trial in @entity14 last week			1
predator : @entity16 , who had been living in @entity17 , @entity18 , groomed a 12 - year - old schoolgirl from the @entity20 by pretending to be a 15 - year - old boy on social network @entity22 he was tried and convicted of rape in his absence with the help of harrowing evidence from his young victim			1
but it is feared that @entity7 has escaped abroad – meaning the victim and her family could face a tortuous wait until he is brought to justice and jailed			1
an international arrest warrant is being prepared to track him down			1
yesterday a close friend of the victim ’s family said : ‘ it beggars belief that a foreign national accused of raping a child was ever allowed out on bail			2
‘ his victim has been astonishingly brave throughout , from reporting the attack to police to giving compelling evidence at the trial			1
her family is incredibly proud of her			2
‘ the police , particularly the family liaison officer , have been wonderful and supportive			2
but the family just can not understand how this man was allowed bail by the courts and to keep his passport			2
‘ apparently he had been assessed and was not deemed a flight risk			2
but the fear is that he has now fled abroad , probably back to @entity57			2
‘ if that is true , we can only hope that he is tracked down and extradited back to the @entity60 and is handed the lengthy sentence this scum deserves			2
’ @entity7 was living in @entity17 , @entity18 , when he first contacted the victim on the social networking site @entity22			1
posing as a sports - loving 15 - year - old , @entity7 spent six months gaining the youngster ’s trust online before he persuaded her to meet him at a supermarket car park			1
skipped bail : @entity7 , 41 , was due to stand trial for rape last week at @entity72 ( pictured ) when the schoolgirl arrived at the rendezvous point , @entity7 claimed he was a relative of the boy who had been asked to meet her because the boy was running late			1
the schoolgirl was immediately suspicious and tried to flee – but @entity7 dragged her into his car and brutally attacked her			1
@entity72 heard that after the victim went to police in 2011 , @entity7 was arrested and his computers were seized			1
he was charged in january this year after a year - long investigation			0
@entity7 later appeared at court , but was inexplicably granted bail			0
after a two - day trial in his absence , @entity7 was found guilty of one count of rape and acquitted of a second rape charge			1
the guilty verdict has brought some comfort to his victim , the family friend said			0
but he added : ‘ justice will only be fully served when this monster is caught and jailed for a very long time			0
’ an @entity97 spokesman said : ‘ there may have been a reason to grant bail to a child sex offender but it ’s difficult to see how that was made with good judgement			0
‘ he is obviously a dangerous man who should have been kept in custody or at the very least strictly monitored so he could not go on the run			0
‘ this lamentable situation means that more children are now at risk of abuse from someone who should now be languishing in prison			0
’ @entity113 , spokesman for @entity114 , confirmed that the judge in the case had ordered that an @entity117 for @entity7 be prepared within 14 days			0
a spokesman for @entity119 , said : ‘ during the investigation @entity7 ... answered police bail on numerous occasions pending detailed examination of forensic evidence			0
‘ he failed to appear at crown court last week and was convicted in his absence			1
a warrant for his arrest will now be issued			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ @entity119 follows strict , national guidelines in relation to granting suspects bail and any bail conditions that are imposed			0
‘ the protection and safeguarding of young people is a top priority for @entity119			0
’ anyone with information about @entity7 ’s whereabouts should contact @entity119 on 101 or call the @entity141 charity , anonymously , on 0800 555 111			0
an earlier version of this article incorrectly carried a headline stating the police granted mr @entity7 bail and allowed him to keep his passport			0
we are happy to clarify that this action was taken by the @entity114 .			0
