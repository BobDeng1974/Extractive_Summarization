by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 10:57 est , 18 june 2013 she is the ultimate natural beauty famed for her glowing skin and flawless complexion			1
and now , songstress @entity6 has revealed the secrets behind her radiant fresh - faced glow as she poses for a set of stunning never - seen - before photographs			2
unlike most celebrities the 31 - year - old has spoken out to tell women that they do n’t need invasive treatments or an entourage of make - up artists to look flawless every day			1
speaking to @entity23 about her beauty secrets , she said : ' covering over the cracks with make - up and fake tan does n’t always make us look or feel better – i always feel more confident and beautiful by doing the body basics before i step out			1
' the best beauty trick i have – and it ’s not even a secret – is to stress how important the basics are			1
' applying makeup around tired eyes , over skin that has not been prepped and wearing beautiful shoes on unloved feet will never make you feel good			1
back to basics : despite having enough money to splurge on luxury goods and top - class make - up artists , @entity27 favours the basics like @entity52 cream ' it 's the small things that have to be done first , such as moisturising from top to toe , that make all the difference			1
' for me , making sure my skin is smooth and hair free , by using products like @entity52 lotion , and regularly washing and cleansing my face all make me feel confident in my skin			1
' whether i ’m make - up free or prepping for a shoot , i need the confidence that my skin will be blemish free			0
@entity68 and @entity69 is great for everyday use – it smells nice , feels great on my skin and is really pleasant to use			1
' by doing the everyday beauty basics every woman can feel great about themselves			1
' secret weapon : to keep her skin blemish free , she relies on @entity68 and @entity69 with some of the busiest tootsies in showbiz , @entity27 explained that taking good care of her feet is also essential : ' with all the dancing i do i need to pay even more attention to my feet as they often take a battering ! in fact , @entity88 did more damage to my feet than climbing @entity90 ! ' now i rely on products like @entity92 to help me get my feet back to being touchable soft and smooth			1
' with my job i ’m lucky that i get to wear beautiful shoes but it means my feet need to look good too – a regular foot care routine is important for me as it ’s easy to forget about your feet , especially when they ’re hidden away			2
' get her glow : she explains she gets plenty of sleep , exercises regularly and has a good diet to maintain her glow revealing how she maintains her famed glow through her diet and lifestyle , despite having a seriously hectic work schedule , the star revealed : ' glowing is straightforward			1
for me this starts by ensuring i get plenty of sleep , exercise regularly and have a good diet			2

' i see my trainer 3 times a week and she works me really hard			1
i 've never been one to deny myself any foods - i train so i can eat what i want ! , ' she said			0
she may not be a size zero , but @entity27 definitely makes the most of her curvy assets and womanly figure and always looks great in figure - hugging dresses			0
' you have to work with what you 've got and accentuate the best bits			0
' i think it 's not always about keeping up with the new fashion trends as they more often than not , do n't suit all shapes , but rather finding a way of making the new trends work for you , ' she added			0
@entity27 's latest job sees her smouldering for the @entity142 to glow campaign			0
a recent study by @entity145 found that the average woman will spend more than £ 13,000 during her lifetime on looking and feeling good			1
researchers found the ' cost of confidence ' carries a hefty price tag , as women fork out £ 205.68 a year - or £ 13,369.20 in their lifetime - on beauty products in order to feel better about themselves			1
around 86 per cent of women claim their confidence is greatly improved if they are well groomed from top to toe			2
and six in ten women have a strict beauty regime in place to ensure they leave the house feeling assured about their appearance			1
but the study also found that despite the costly outlay , women only feel good about themselves for three hours and 43 minutes a day			1
speaking about her role , which aims to empower women to look and feel great by carrying out everyday beauty basics to achieve that radiant ‘ glow ' , she said : ' i am proud to be part of @entity142 to glow , like many woman i ’ve had my own body hang - ups in the past but i ’m passionate about helping or supporting other women to feel confident in their own skin and celebrating natural beauty			1
' but the talented star always has her eyes firmly set on the future			2
speaking about her big plans , she said : ' i 'm someone that loves to keep busy , and always love to have things in my diary ! ' at the moment i 'm busy working on my book which is due for release in the autumn			1
