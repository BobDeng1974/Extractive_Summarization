but a secret guerrilla group of do - gooders are determined to turn ' @entity5 ' into a day to look forward to - by handing out envelopes stuffed with cash to complete strangers			1
hundreds of the blue envelopes have been found across @entity10 and the south east accompanied by handwritten notes of cheer			1
but rather than finding a clever marketing ploy or pr stunt , visitors to the site looking for more information are likely to leave just as mystified			0
it seems the @entity23 group was set up simply because ' giving feels good and mondays are blue '			1
the site reads : ' one fine morning we had an epiphany - giving feels good and mondays are blue			1
' blessed with this wonderful insight we decided to set up @entity23 and encourage people to give their week the best possible start by good deeds every monday			1
' so who are we ? @entity23 is an anonymous community of givers			2
and we ’d like you to join us			0
' the website and @entity46 page is filled with stories of people who have found the envelopes in supermarkets , wedged between library books , or have been personally handed it with a smile before the mystery benefactors disappear into the distance			1
@entity57 said he found his propped up in a drinks cooler in a @entity61 's near bank : ' it said ...			2
" the question you got ta ask yourself is ' do i feel lucky ? ' " , and on the reverse it said ... " well do ya ? @entity68 ! "			0
the website and @entity46 page is filled with stories of people who have found the envelopes in supermarkets , wedged between library books , or have been personally handed it with a smile before the mystery benefactors disappear into the distance ' i do now ! it was so weird			1
i picked up the envelope and looked round the shop			0
i was all paranoid thinking i might be on tv or that someone was watching me ! alas it was just a random act of @entity85 you random stranger ! ' i think i will either give the money to @entity90 charity , or i might ' @entity91 ' next monday for someone else ! ' @entity93 wrote : ' i was handed a little blue envelope containing £ 10 as i was being evacuated from @entity95 and had to walk the rest of the journey			1
' i was a little overwhelmed , but did n't cry ... i 've given it to the @entity99 because they do such great work ! ' @entity10 , @entity102 , said : ' i was walking along @entity103 , a bit stressed because i was a bit late for an appointment , and the lady who was walking in front of me turned suddenly , gave me the blue envelope and said ' this is for you , happy monday ! ' ' then she disappeared into the crowdy ( sic ) street			1
map of kindness : it seems the give monday group was set up simply because ' giving feels good and mondays are blue '			1
the graphic shows where the envelopes have been found			1
@entity5 represents envelopes which have not been claimed			2
red ones have already been found ' i was shocked and a bit scared of opening it ... but when i actually saw the inside and the message , i felt very lucky , specially after having been through a bit of a hard time lately and trying to turn my mind in a " positive mind "			2
that blue envelope really helped			0
' i will pass it to someone next monday , it is a fantastic idea to cheer people up this way , and specially on a monday			2
' @entity138 , from @entity10 , added : ' wow how amazing ! brightened up a bad monday and made me think of the good things in the world and will keep on trying to pass on good things to others			1
just the front of the envelope made me smile : ) ' and @entity145 , wrote : ' flabbergasted			0
@entity10 is not such a cold place after all			1
' the end goal of the @entity23 group is not yet clear			2
a message posted on their website reads : ' first things first - we want to build a community of givers			0
' we think the best way to do this is by encouraging random acts of kindness and will announce some new ones in the coming months			0
' long term we want to offer our community different ways to give each monday			0
' we ’ll continue the random acts but also showcase inspirational fundraisers , unsung heroes and local projects that need your help			0
' but their efforts certainly seem to be turning @entity5 into happy monday for those that have stumbled across their generosity			0
@entity175 , who was handed her envelope on the tube between @entity178 and @entity179 , said : ' it really brought a smile to my face - and the couple sitting next to me - and the positive message it sends out means a world more to me than the kindly gifted £ 10 note			0
' i hope i get a chance to gift something the next day this comes around			0
