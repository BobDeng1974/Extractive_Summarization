by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 12:48 est , 4 september 2012 the good old days : @entity1 and @entity2 were inseparable before he went missing a dedicated pet owner who lost her beloved dog two years ago is offering a staggering £ 10,000 reward just to find out what happened to him			1
animal lover @entity8 has spent more than £ 6,000 delivering thousands of leaflets , knocking doors and flying back and forth from her @entity12 home to find her dog @entity2			1
she has even got the attention of pet care retail giant @entity15 and celebrity vet @entity16			0
mrs @entity8 is now also getting help from former policeman turned pet detective @entity19 , as well as trying animal psychics and tracker dogs			0
and now with @entity19 's help she 's even got a video van - usually used in police missing person searches - to drive around the @entity25 beaming video footage of her lost dog			0
after getting the @entity29 as a puppy in 2004 @entity1 had the heartache of leaving him in the @entity33 on a farm with friends after she married her pilot husband and moved to the @entity37			1
the former helicopter instructor knew @entity2 would n't have a life in her 23rd floor apartment or be able to cope with @entity42 summer heat so found him a ' doggy heaven ' on a farm in @entity45 , @entity46			0
but on august 7 2010 @entity2 disappeared from the farm a day after he 'd gone missing for several hours before returning ' agitated ' and ' glad to be home '			1
scroll down to see the missing dog appeal video reward : distraught pet owner puts up the cash reward in a bid to find @entity2 even though thousands have been spent already			1
on the hunt : detectives @entity57 ( left ) and @entity19 are helping search for @entity2 and the car used to find missing pets mrs @entity8 still fights back the tears talking about her ' baby ' and said the reward was for any information that would let her know what has happened to him			1
the 55 - year - old , who lives with @entity69 pilot husband @entity68 , said using the video van - which toured the @entity25 on friday - was her final push to find @entity2 who now would be around 11 years old			2
she said : ' for people who think it 's " just a dog " i would say he was my baby , he and dogs like him are part of the family , he used to sleep on my bed			0
' when i had to move to @entity12 it was heart - breaking leaving @entity2 behind but our friend @entity84 and her family had a farm and i knew him living there would be much more dog friendly than a 23rd floor apartment and 50 degree heat , it was ' doggy heaven '			1
just playing around : @entity1 and @entity2 used to have lots of fun together before she had to leave him to go to @entity12 part of the family - @entity2 had finally settled down with his new owner @entity84 on the farm in @entity45 , @entity46 ' @entity97 are very loyal friendly dogs , they were bred to protect farms in @entity100 so they are protective but @entity2 is the most loving dog			1
' when i went to @entity2 was welcomed into a lovely home where he was loved and cared for for six years - longer than he was with me			2
these are just some of the extreme lengths @entity8 went to in order to find her dog ... ' they took him in and he was their beloved boy			2
@entity84 in particular was devastated when he went missing from under her nose , he was her best friend			0
' on the farm he would always be close to @entity84 guarding her , then the day before he went missing they could n't find him for several hours and when he did come back he was agitated and very glad to be home it seemed			2
' he disappeared the next day			0
i now think his behaviour the day before could have been because someone had befriended him and kept him somewhere perhaps in preparation to take him away			0
' i feel like i have let him down , i know £ 10,000 is a lot of money and it 's all the savings i have			0
' the reward is because i need to know what has happened to @entity2 , he might still be suffering now , he might be dead , we need to know			0
' the reward is for any information , we just need to get some closure			0
' when @entity2 first went missing mrs @entity8 flew back to the @entity33 and met with @entity19 - a former policeman turned pet detective - who runs the @entity33 's biggest missing pet service @entity130 @entity33			1
mrs @entity8 added : " @entity19 has been amazing , he helped me organise the search for @entity2 and we have never given up			1
' @entity19 has even agreed to drive the video van around for next to nothing , this could be the final push to find @entity2 as he would be getting older now			2
' when @entity2 went missing he a missing lower front tooth , a scratched face from a previous altercation with a badger and a scarred tip of his right ear			0
pet detective @entity19 said @entity1 's determination and the lengths she has gone to find @entity2 were the most he has ever seen			1
he said : ' what @entity1 has done to find @entity2 is remarkable and a real testament to love she has for him , she has spent thousands and even flown back to the @entity33 to search for him			2

@entity8 first suffered heartache when she had to leave @entity2 with family friends when she left for @entity12
then @entity2 went missing from his new home
she 's spent £ 6,000 already looking for him *including* *contacting* a psychic
has now *begged* for detectives ' help to find the @entity29
