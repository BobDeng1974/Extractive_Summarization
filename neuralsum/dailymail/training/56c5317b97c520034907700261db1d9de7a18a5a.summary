previously unseen photographs revealing the extent of the neglect suffered by a baby orangutan before his rescue have been released as donations to pay for his care hit £ 50,000			1
@entity9 was caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life but is now on the road to recovery thanks to a @entity17 animal welfare charity			1
new video footage and photographs taken at a rescue centre in @entity21 reveal the staggering improvement in his health - from a 10 - month - old ape too weak to move , to sitting up and eating from a spoon			1
here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in @entity21 before @entity9 was rescued , his owner had n't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him			1
her ignorance and neglect were killing him slowly and painfully , but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand him over			2
he was rescued in @entity54 by @entity55 and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home in @entity21			0
his little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent			0
but the future is now looking bright for @entity65 thanks to the people caring for him at the rescue centre and @entity70 readers who have helped raised £ 50,000 in a few short weeks			1
a new video shows him eating pureed food from a spoon , which vet @entity75 describes as ' remarkable '			2
' when @entity9 first arrived he did n’t even have the muscle strength to open his own mouth , ' she said			1
' the vets would have to press the sides of his mouth gently so it would open wide enough for them to get the food into him			0
' slurp ! when @entity30 was found , he was too weak to open his mouth to eat , but he now eagerly licks pureed food from a spoon rest : after such an ordeal , @entity30 is making the most of having a comfortable pillow to get some well - deserved sleep he is still not able to eat solid food because he has n't learned how to chew , but can sit up on his own - quite a change from the ape found lying on his back on the floor of his wire cage unable to move			1
the plight of the orangutan in @entity54 has reached a critical stage , with the survival of the species under serious threat			0
animals are suffering and dying because of the destruction of the rainforest - primarily for palm oil production			0
@entity55 is working in @entity111 , @entity21 to rescue and care for baby orangutans that have been taken from their mothers to be illegally sold as pets , and adults that have spent their entire lives in captivity , chained up or imprisoned in tiny cages			2
the team also goes to the aid of orangutans stranded when their forest home is destroyed and relocates these vulnerable animals to safe areas of protected forest			2
@entity127 , the @entity129 - based charity 's chief executive , said : ' @entity30 has won the hearts of people across the world and we ’re overwhelmed and delighted by the generosity the public has shown in supporting his treatment and care			1
' it ’s an absolute joy to see the transformation in him and know that he is no longer in pain			0
' it ’s a great testimony to the skill and dedication of our team that @entity30 is progressing so well			1
and clearly he is a little fighter with a strong will to survive			0
' thanks to everyone who is helping to pay for his treatment and care , he has the best possible chance of a full recovery			2
' we really hope people will continue to follow and support his journey back to full health			2
' he still has a long road ahead of him and will be at our centre for several years to come , so we need all the help we can get with his rehabilitation in the hope that one day he will be fit to return to the forest and fend for himself			1
' the charity estimates it will cost about £ 5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild			2
if @entity30 does n't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest , @entity55 will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life			1
severe malnutrition : @entity30 's little body was bloated with fluid and his limbs were swollen and bent when he was rescued from his cruel owner @entity179 , from @entity55 , said : ' when @entity70 reported the story of @entity30 the baby orangutan on january 22 , it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world			1
singer / songwriter @entity187 tweeted her support for @entity9 ' @entity30 has appeared on websites , blogs and tv in @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			1
' @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 have tweeted their support for the orangutan			0
the latest celebrity to give her backing to the fundraising campaign is singer and songwriter @entity187 , who currently has two songs in the @entity206			0
although @entity30 is on the road to recovery , his moving story is far from unique			1
mr @entity211 explained : ' @entity213 , we now have 84 orangutans in our rescue centre in @entity21 and every one of them has a story that would make you weep			0
' we ’re always in need of money to pay for their care and rehabilitation			0
@entity55 , based in @entity225 , @entity224 saves animals , big and small , from suffering around the world			0
work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in @entity230 , rescuing primates from captivity in @entity54 , and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries			0
wherever possible , the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild			0
@entity55 works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals			0
sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision - making and determines the course of its rescue operations			0
it also works with other like - minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect			0
' we ’re hoping that public interest and concern for @entity30 will make people want to find out more about our rescue and rehabilitation project as a whole and help us care for these tragic victims of relentless deforestation and the illegal trade in primates			1
' to donate £ 10 towards the cost of @entity30 's care , please text @entity272 £ 10 to 70070			1
recovery : @entity30 tries new foods but has n't learned how to chew			2
