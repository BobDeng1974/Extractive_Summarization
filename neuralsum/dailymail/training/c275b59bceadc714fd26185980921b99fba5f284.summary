@entity0 has made many improvements to the @entity3 national team since taking over as head coach in 2011			1
one of his first moves , though , may resonate with football supporters in @entity7 who suspect our national footballers are handled too gingerly			2
‘ like most teams , we had a player liaison officer on board , ’ said a source close to the @entity3 set - up on wednesday			1
‘ they used to look after the players ’ needs , get them tickets for things , organise travel and things like that			2
@entity0 did n’t see the point of it			1
his view was the players were grown men and they should be able to look after themselves			0
he found another job for her			0
on @entity57 ’s north - east coast , @entity0 ’s talented @entity3 team face @entity40 in @entity58 @entity40 , of course , are managed by @entity50 , @entity0 ’s friend and the man who served as his assistant when @entity0 managed his home country in their own @entity54 eight years ago			1
a draw will ensure both teams go through to the next stage , leaving @entity67 and @entity68 to fly home			2
not surprisingly , conspiracy theories abound			0
even the taxi driver taking journalists to the airport in @entity74 yesterday expressed the view that a cosy draw was in the offing			2
@entity0 , for his part , has simply said the right things			1
‘ there is no time for friendship calls to @entity83 , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ this is all about business now			0
there will be no such call			0
in three weeks from now we will be back on the phone and talk about it and visit each other ’s families			0
but we want to make the life of @entity37 more difficult , we want to beat them			0
’ old news : @entity40 head coach @entity50 says historical connections mean nothing to his players bounceback : @entity50 addresses his players as they look to return to winning ways at @entity100 in @entity52 tough encounter : @entity40 met an intensely competitive @entity68 team in the 2 - 2 draw , which they expect from the @entity3 side too eyes will be focused particularly keenly on today ’s game at @entity107 partly because of an uncomfortable piece of history			1
at the 1982 @entity54 in @entity110 , @entity40 faced @entity111 in their final group game in @entity113 knowing that a 1 - 0 victory would take them through to the next stage and prove a narrow enough defeat for the @entity118 to accompany them at @entity121 ’s expense			1
@entity40 won 1 - 0 and the game became known as the ‘ @entity123 ’ with @entity121 furious at the perceived lack of effort from both teams following an early goal			1
@entity0 said : ‘ you are talking about a game that happened decades ago			1
it is part of @entity37 history , not @entity133 history			2
if you look at our history , we make things happen			0
‘ if we did n’t , then @entity137 would n’t be at this @entity54 because we beat @entity138 to help them qualify			2
‘ we have that fighting spirit and determination to do well in every game			0
we want to go at @entity40 , win the game and be in the driving seat for the next round			1
the @entity67 performance shows how far we have made it already			0
‘ we have one foot in the door of the second round			0
we just need to put the second foot in there now			0

@entity40 and @entity133 would both *progress* to the last *16* of the @entity54 if they drew the *fixture*
@entity0 says @entity3 will be going all out to win the @entity58 tie despite the benefits of a draw
