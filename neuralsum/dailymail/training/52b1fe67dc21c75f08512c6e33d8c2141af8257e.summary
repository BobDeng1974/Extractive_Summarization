when @entity1 turned 30 she lost weight and find out that nothing in her wardrobe fit her any more			1
the marketing manager from @entity6 , @entity7 , 33 , had reached 12st 7lb and at 5ft 6in it was the heaviest she 'd ever been - but after shedding nearly 3st over the next year , shrinking from a size 16 to a size 10 , she had a new problem on her hands			1
she said : ' my confidence soared			0
the only problem was that now , each morning , i was faced with a rail of clothes which were all too big for me			0
' @entity1 could no longer fit into her clothes after dropping 3st - so she revamped her wardrobe using charity shop finds			1
pictured : @entity1 in a £ 4.50 @entity21 skirt and vintage £ 15 @entity23 bag the £ 3 vintage bag and £ 4 @entity26 lace collar top she wore on day 29 of the challenge ( left ) certainly do n't look like charity shop finds @entity1 had let her weight creep up , indulging her sweet tooth and eating large portions until she hit her landmark birthday and decided to go on a health kick			1
but a new body demanded a new wardrobe			2
she said : ' i was in danger of looking like a small kid playing dressing up in her mum 's closet and my over-sized wardrobe would n't cut the mustard in my new marketing officer job at a hospice either			2
' although i could afford to buy a few pieces including an extra skirt or two on @entity50 , it was n't enough			0
' and before working at @entity52 as a marketing officer , she 'd never have stepped foot inside a charity shop			1
' spending hours rummaging through rails in the vain hope of discovering a genuine vintage gem seemed far too much like hard work , ' she said			0
@entity1 was very pleased with a @entity62 beige dress ( left ) which she bought for £ 5 in her first week she found a pair of @entity66 leather tan and gold studded sandals for only £ 15			1
' a friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £ 100 ! ' she said she bought a month 's worth of secondhand clothes , which set her back just £ 200			1
one find was a fitted @entity77 dress ( right ) which cost just £ 7 ' and i 'd always thought charity shops were just full of @entity80 ’s musty old cast - offs			1
' but @entity52 had charity shops all around @entity7			1
and so she decided to set herself a challenge			0
she said : ' what if i could replenish my wardrobe with second - hand items ? i liked the idea of a challenge and i decided to take it one step further			2
every day for a whole month i 'd wear a different item bought from one of their charity shops			1
' i 'd also post a selfie of me in my new outfit on social media			1
' but she decided if she was going to go ahead she 'd want it to be authentic			0
that meant finding clothes and accessories that she would genuinely pick off the shelf and buy from any other high street shop			1
she says : ' my personal style is fairly conservative but i do know what suits me and my body shape			0
and my finds would have to see me through all different occasions - work , social events and the gym			2
@entity1 ( pictured left and right before weight loss ) was at her heaviest weight , 12st 7lb , when she decided it was time to adopt a healthier lifestyle now , the 30 - year - old marketing officer ( in a £ 6 @entity120 top found in a charity shop in @entity7 ) feels fitter and healthier than ever before ' but would i be able to find 31 days ' worth of items ? and more importantly , would i look a wally ? ' her family and friends were doubtful , as was she at first			1
she says : ' people kept saying i would n't be able to do it , while others pointed out i would n't know who ’d warn them , or that they might smell			0
and i must admit i was a bit dubious			0
' but she need n't have worried			0
she says : ' on the first day i found a brand new , chic @entity135 pencil skirt with the price tag still on it - but instead of £ 30 it was only £ 6			2
she picked up a tailored white dress for just £ 6 ( left ) and a @entity140 denim jacket for £ 15 ( right ) she asked took selfies and posted them on @entity143 and @entity144 , with the hashtag @entity145 ' the next day i found a gorgeous pair of @entity66 leather tan and gold studded sandals for £ 15			2
a friend later told me she has the same pair in black and they cost more than £ 100			2
' subsequent finds included a @entity140 denim jacket , also £ 15 , a new @entity77 dress for £ 7 and a @entity158 snakeskin shirt for £ 3.50			0
' during other visits my luck continued with all sorts of great pieces , including a @entity21 fusion patterned skirt for £ 4.50 , a @entity166 blue silky vest top in medium for £ 4 , a @entity62 beige dress for £ 5 and a stripy purple and white gap top for £ 4.50			0
' i also found some fantastic accessories , including a pair of @entity174 sunglasses for only a tenner and one of my best finds - a real vintage black leather @entity23 bag for £ 15			0
' it had suffered slight wear and tear but i took it home , put some boot polish on it , gave it a buff and it came up looking brand new			0
' amazingly , after just six visits @entity1 had more than enough and could n't wait to show off what she 'd found			2
so on the first day of the next month she kicked off her challenge by wearing a pale blue and white nautical dress that she 'd picked up for £ 6			2
she asked a colleague to take a picture of her in it and posted it on @entity143 and @entity144 , with the hashtag @entity193 and that morning she was inundated with likes , comments and retweets			1
@entity1 , who works at @entity52 in @entity7 , visited several charity shops in the area to find her 31 pieces of clothing and accessories @entity1 received a ' like ' all the way from @entity204 for a @entity207 - inspired £ 4 @entity206 pleated skirt ( pictured ) as the month unfolded , her charity finds suited every occasion , a £ 6 @entity120 top she 'd picked up for the gym , a pair of £ 4 floral lounge pants from @entity215 for a girly pizza night , the @entity210 skirt and denim jacket she 'd found the first week which she wore out shopping with her sister			1
she says : ' as i mixed and matched the pieces people could n't believe what i 'd managed to find			0
i had to convince some that it really was all secondhand and i was n’t pretending			0
' by now she 'd picked up 600 followers on social media and as the month went by she received endless compliments			1
she says : ' people were saying how much i ’d inspired them and some asked if i ’d go shopping with them			0
one of her found treasures was a pair of £ 4 floral lounge pants from @entity215 ( left ) , which she for a girly pizza night , and a £ 4 denim skater skirt £ 4 ( right ) @entity1 ( in her £ 15 @entity140 denim jacket ) says the charity shop challenge has made her appreciate secondhand style , because ' you are very likely to find a one - off item that no - one else will have ' ' i was also thrilled to get a " like " all the way from @entity204 when i wore a @entity207 - style @entity206 ’s beige and black check pleated skirt which i had bought for £ 4 , because it reminded me of my maternal nan who used to work at @entity250			1
' probably at least 20 years old , i paired it with a simple black vest and smart black heels , bringing it bang up to date			0
' by the end of the month @entity1 could n't believe how much success she 'd had			2
she says : ' i had a wardrobe bursting with new clothes and the best part was it only cost me £ 200			1
' i 'd also managed to raise some money for the hospice as well as inspiring others to do the same			0
' now i still wear secondhand clothes every day			0
i 've discovered the beauty of charity shops is you are very likely to find a one - off item that no - one else will have			1

@entity1 , 33 , lost weight and was too thin for her wardrobe
without the cash to shop on the high street , she raided charity shops
rummaged in six shops run by @entity52 in @entity7 for one month
amazingly , her entire wardrobe *refresh* came in at just £ 200
posted her outfits on social media under hashtag @entity193
