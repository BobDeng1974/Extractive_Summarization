a two - timing cheat with a very short temper decided to go on @entity2 to decide if he should leave his wife for his mistress , and let the two ladies meet for the first time			1
@entity7 is married to @entity8 , but while the two were separated he began dating @entity10			1
that was two years ago , and now @entity7 spends his time flip flopping between the two women , who have somehow fallen under his spell			2
@entity8 also has little tolerance for the woman who stayed with her husband as they tried to work on their relationship			2
' it ’s disgusting to me , ' she tells @entity10			2
' i do n’t see how someone could do that			0
if she knows we were trying to work things out , she should be a woman and back away			0
' it is also revealed that @entity8 alleges that she got two stds from her husband			0
@entity7 meanwhile is frequently annoyed and put off that the audience keeps laughing as he portrays himself as a victim of love , unsure of what to do			0
at one point he even storms off stage , with @entity10 quickly running after him			0
called out : dr. @entity2 can not understand why either woman is with @entity7 when asked why everyone keeps laughing at him , dr. @entity2 is kind enough to explain , saying ; ' they ’re laughing because it ’s ridiculous			1
they ’re laughing because of your absolute and utter lack of insight and narcissistic , self - serving sh * t is more than they can take			0
' he then adds , ' and that should be a huge wake - up call to you			0
' @entity10 meanwhile claims she just wants @entity7 to be loved , and says that @entity8 treats him horribly whenever they get back together			1
dr. @entity2 informs her she does not get an opinion on the matter as she is an ' interlooper ' in the relationship			0
in the end however , dr. @entity2 explains to @entity10 , ' if he cheats on his wife he 's going to cheat on you			1
' as for @entity7 , it seems like @entity8 may have finally had enough , and he and the mistress certainly seem to deserve one another			1
@entity7 and @entity10 end the show next to one another , though it is still not clear who he is with now .			1

@entity7 is married to @entity8 but having an affair with @entity10
@entity7 met @entity10 when he was separated , and even though he and his wife have *reconciled* they have remained together for two years
he decided to pick one woman once and for all by going on @entity2
