@entity5 , 64 , had to be rescued from her @entity6 after she drove it 200 yards along @entity8 's @entity7			1
to add to her embarrassment a tram full of @entity12 fans on their way to a concert at @entity16 's @entity15 had to get out and walk and they jeered at her when they went past			1
she blames what she sees as a lack of clear signs at a road crossing between @entity24 and @entity26 stations			1
@entity5 had to be rescued from her @entity6 after getting stuck on tramlines near @entity16 's stadium she said : ' it 's not clearly signposted at all , i just took the right turn and before i knew it i was driving along the track			2
' i was thinking about everyone else 's safety and thought if i reversed i might reverse into oncoming traffic or even a tram so i kept going			0
' it was an awful experience , my tyre had burst and i did n't know what to do but no - one was helping me and everyone was laughing and jeering at me			0
hundreds of @entity12 fans had to get off a tram and walk to the stadium as a result of mrs @entity5 's mishap ' it was like a @entity50 arena with people shouting and screaming			1
if i was their mother i 'd have been ashamed			0
' it made me cross that @entity7 said the correct signage is in place because i could n't see it			0
' my worry is that it will happen again or that someone coming out of the pub across the road could walk up there and get more seriously hurt			2
' however @entity7 responded by saying that there had not been an issue for ' the vast majority of motorists '			1
@entity65 , @entity66 's @entity7 director , said : ' the clear signage we 've put in place near tram tracks to advise motorists is based on sound , industry - standard principles and best practice - and has been agreed with @entity8 council			2
' we understand that changes to the road layout can be confusing and appreciate that the changes will involve a period of adjustment and familiarisation for drivers			0
' considering how many cars pass through the area on any given day , we do not believe it is an issue for the vast majority of motorists			1
' the track runs along the main road before bearing left away from the main carriageway			0
circular blue signs reading â€˜ tram only ' are in place at either side of the entrance to the tram line at the busy junction - which links @entity94 with @entity95 and @entity96 .			2

hundreds of @entity12 fans had to get out of dram and walk to concert
@entity5 blamed lack of signs at the crossing in @entity8
