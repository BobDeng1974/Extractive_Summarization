@entity1 coach @entity0 insisted @entity3 ’s proposed move to @entity4 is finished after picking him for sunday ’s opening @entity6 tie			1
but while the @entity7 was adamant he would not let his highly talented back - row return to @entity9 to further his @entity11 ambitions , he conceded that the club ’s bosses could still do a deal behind his back			1
if @entity3 does play against @entity16 in the @entity17 on sunday , he will be cup - tied for the rest of the competition and @entity4 would walk away			1
@entity3 ( centre ) is held back by @entity22 defenders playing for @entity1 in the @entity23 last weekend @entity1 coach @entity0 is adamant that @entity3 will not be returning to @entity9 @entity0 said : ‘ i am not exactly sure where this story about @entity3 really started but for me in sporting terms it is over , finished			1
‘ i have spoken to @entity3 and he knows the situation			2
he will start at no 8 for us on sunday			0
as for what the club presidents are doing , i do not know			0
my business is to make @entity1 win			2
’ @entity3 , 29 , has been in talks with @entity4 for the past week about a deal which would allow to play in next year ’s @entity11 , but the @entity39 are loath to pay the reported £ 240,000 transfer fee to release him from the last two years of his contract			1
with talks stalling , and the @entity43 apparently unwilling to upset other @entity45 clubs or undermine the competition by providing financial support to @entity4 , @entity1 on thursday maintained a hard - line stance			1
the back row forward was named @entity6 player of the year as @entity1 won the @entity51 last season @entity3 made five appearances for @entity9 while at @entity54 in 2009 @entity1 owner @entity55 drives a notoriously hard bargain and could be playing a game of brinkmanship in an attempt to squeeze as much commercial capital out of the deal as possible			1
so , while @entity0 is understandably keen to retain a player who has excelled for the defending @entity6 champions over the past two seasons , the decision may be taken out of his hands			2
@entity43 rules , introduced to dissuade @entity69 - qualified players from signing lucrative contracts in @entity7 which would weaken the @entity45 , mean only players playing in @entity9 can be selected for the national side except in exceptional circumstances			2
and with next year ’s @entity11 looming , @entity3 is desperate to be involved			1
‘ of course , i know what the @entity11 means for players , ’ @entity0 added			0
‘ if you have to go , you go			0
that is what i spoke with @entity79 ( @entity80 ) about on wednesday			0
i wanted to know precisely what the situation was			0
in fact , it is nothing to do with @entity79			0
the policy of the @entity69 union is exact			0
you have to be in @entity9 to play for the national team			2
’ the back row forward looks set to stay at @entity1 and not play for @entity9 at next year 's @entity11 @entity4 ’s back - row injury crisis has left @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 all sidelined , while @entity95 is suspended			1
complicating matters further are @entity3 ’s expected wage demands			0
he is currently on a deal worth more than £ 300,000 at @entity1 and , with @entity4 already close to the @entity45 ’s salary cap , it is unclear how they would accommodate him within budget			1
with this sunday ’s clash with @entity16 appearing to be @entity105 for the proposed deal , it looks increasingly unlikely they need to worry about that .			0

@entity3 looked set for move to @entity4 from @entity1
@entity6 player of the year needs to join @entity45 if he is to *fulfill* dream of representing @entity9 at 2015 @entity11
negotiations have broken down between @entity1 and @entity4
@entity3 named in @entity1 squad for @entity17 on sunday
if @entity3 plays he will be *ineligible* to play in @entity119 for @entity4
