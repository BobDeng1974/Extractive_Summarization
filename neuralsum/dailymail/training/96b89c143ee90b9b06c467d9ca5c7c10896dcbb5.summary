@entity1 workers have slammed one of the corporation 's leading offices after being left at work without internet or telephone connections			1
staff at @entity9 in @entity10 deemed the building ' unfit for purpose ' when , despite a £ 1billion refurbishment , lifts and dishwashers in the building broke down repeatedly			1
among other complaints was faulty equipment , cold canteen food and substandard it services which left workers ' fed up '			1
workers claimed the resources at @entity9 in west @entity10 were substandard , with internet and phone connections often breaking down their woes were revealed in published in the corporation 's in - house magazine @entity29 in the form of a letter written by @entity32 , who works for @entity33 on @entity34			1
' i had to deal with out telephone system not working , the internet connection breaking down on my computer ( " you 've got a profile problem , mate " ) ... and the archive having an ongoing issue , ' mr @entity32 bemoaned			0
' @entity44 up with trying to work like this , i set off for the canteen but the lift was broken , and the non-automatic automatic door still had its sign apologising for the inconvenience of its continued breakdown			0
' mr @entity32 also complained that the dishwasher seldom worked , and questioned how so many problems were occurring after such a costly refurbishment			0
' how did a brand new building with brand new equipment end up with so many of its fixtures and fittings not working properly ? and is anyone being held accountable for this ? ' other workers have complained about broken microwaves , cold canteen food and no forks to eat with			1
one worker , who asked not to be identified , said : ' there are 6,000 of us in this supposedly state - of - the art building , but everything just keeps on breaking down			2
under construction : in 2007 , extensive construction work began at the site in @entity74 in 2012 , after five years of buiding , works were ongoing at the site			0
more than £ 1billion is thought to have been spent in the vast refurbishment ' at first it was put down to teething problems , but a lot of us have been here for a couple of years now and so many things are still breaking down or causing major problems			1
' for an organisation like the @entity1 not to have internet connection or phone service - even if just for a while - is embarrassing			0
' the minor stuff , like the broken dishwashers , queues for the microwaves and broken lifts is just normal stuff really , but when you think that £ 1bn was spend on getting this place ship - shape , it is quite ridiculous			2
' building manager @entity97 said he did n't ' recognise ' the building described in workers ' complaints			2
' like any workplace of this size there will occasionally be problems that need resolving , but the overwhelming feedback we receive is that @entity9 is a great place to work and we do n’t recognise the picture being painted in this letter			0
' the facilities management team at @entity111 work hard to ensure the building runs as smoothly as possible			0
