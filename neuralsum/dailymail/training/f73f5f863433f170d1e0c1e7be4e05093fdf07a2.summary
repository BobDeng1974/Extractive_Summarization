by @entity0 chilling video footage appears to show a @entity3 militant taking part in the cold - blooded execution of a prisoner loyal to @entity8 president @entity7			1
the film shows a man kneeling with his feet crossed and head bowed in a field in @entity8 , then being shot in the back of the head by a man armed with a pistol			1
another man then fires at the prisoner with a machine gun			2
researchers at the @entity21 for the @entity22 ( @entity23 ) believe that this gunman is from @entity25 and is part of a militant group called @entity28 ( @entity29 of @entity30 )			1
@entity23 researcher @entity61 told @entity62 : ' the guy with the @entity41 who fires shots into the body is in several other @entity28 videos			1
on the videos the group claims to have four @entity3 brothers with them and two of those guys feature very prominently			1
they both wear distinctive balaclavas and big fat black watches			2
they 're the only two who wear these watches			2
' we spent a day looking at the group 's @entity60 videos and the footage of the execution - in which he does n't speak - and concluded that the stature , balaclava and watch of the gunman matches that of the man in the other videos			1
we do n't know the history of the man who was shot			2
' @entity92 , a senior researcher at the @entity93 - based @entity23 said the killing of prisoners may constitute a war crime			0
he told @entity97 : ‘ it 's incredibly serious			0
' plea : in one @entity60 video the @entity3 fighters ask friends and relatives back home to donate money so more arms can be bought connection : the @entity3 militant on the left , filmed on a @entity60 video urging muslims to support jihad , is believed to be one of the gunmen that took part in the execution extreme viewpoint : on one @entity28 @entity60 video a fighter says ' for each arrow that is thrown at the enemies of @entity122 , it is as though you 've freed a slave ' @entity125 , the head of @entity126 , has ordered its @entity8 branch , the @entity127 , to stop fighting rival militants as divisions are ' a gift to @entity7 '			1
the pronouncement was made by the terror chief in an audiotape that was posted online			0
@entity125 told @entity127 's leader , @entity135 to refocus and target @entity8 's ruling party , the @entity136 , which is run by president @entity7			1
he said he should ' devote himself to combat the enemies of @entity138 , specifically @entity136 , @entity139 and their allies ' , according to @entity97			0
@entity23 found the footage of the killing , which took place in @entity144 in northern @entity8 , on the @entity146 account of a man thought to be from @entity25 , and it was posted with a message describing the prisoner as ‘ one of bashars [ sic ] dogs ’			1
the note claimed that the man shot was a murderer and rapist			2
it continued : ‘ @entity158 he testified to killing four brothers and raping a sister			0
the punishment was carried out by a dawlah shari'e			0
it is not for a @entity164 that he should have prisoners of war ( and free them with ransom ) until he had made a great slaughter ( among his enemies ) in the land			0
’ in separate videos posted to @entity60 by @entity28 , the man believed to have fired a machine gun at the prisoner is filmed urging @entity110 in the @entity3 to support the fighters and their families			1
in one , he says : ‘ whoever equips a fighter or takes care of a fighter 's family , it 's though he has fought himself			0
' he continued : ‘ brothers may have the opportunity to equip the fighter and if it 's not to equip a fighter it 's to look after the family of those brothers we have lost			0
it 's not much to go to the family of a lost fighter and maybe drop 10 or 20 pounds , 40 or 50 pounds , especially if you know this woman			0
the true man that left her behind has left her behind with kids			2
left to go to jihad			0
where are you now , when you know this woman is in need ? ' in another video the man , alongside another militant , documents the machine guns , ammunition and tactical vests that were bought using donations - and urges people back in the @entity3 to give them money so more can be purchased			2
the other fighter says : ' for each arrow that is thrown at the enemies of @entity122 , it is as though you 've freed a slave			0
the brother [ indicating the man to his left ] shot three magazines			2
how many slaves is that ? ' mr @entity61 said the @entity3 government should be very worried about the videos being produced by @entity28 , as they could lead to acts of terrorism			1
he said : ' at the very least the major concern is that you 've got @entity3 citizens producing videos inviting young people to come and fight in @entity8			1
it 's not being framed in terms of a defence narrative			0
it 's just glorifying violence			0
we have to be seriously concerned about what training they have out there			0
' the government should have a very thorough method of assessing people who come back			0
it could lead to a terrorism threat			0
' a @entity3 government spokesperson said : ' this demonstrates why we have consistently called for the situation in @entity8 to be referred to the @entity252			1
whether this barbaric act is specifically a war crime is for a court to decide			0
horrific atrocities have been committed by both the @entity7 regime and by extremists			1
the international community must ensure that all those responsible are held to account			0
' we advise against all travel to @entity8 by @entity3 citizens			1
even people travelling for well - intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk , including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups			0
the best way to help the @entity8 people is to donate to @entity3 - registered charities that have ongoing relief operations			1
' our priority is to dissuade people from travelling , but any extremists should know we are prepared to take action to protect national security , and intelligence agencies and police are working to identify potential threats			0
' on friday @entity8 's government and rebels agreed to a ceasefire in the battleground city of @entity284 to allow hundreds of fighters holed up in its old quarters to evacuate , a move that would surrender almost total control of the city once known as the ' capital of the revolution ' to forces loyal to president @entity7			1
the capture of @entity284 , @entity8 's third largest city , would be a significant victory for @entity7 , weeks before presidential elections set for june 3 - if the agreement goes through and rebel fighters leave			1
it is feared that hundreds of young @entity3 are being lured to join fighting in @entity8 by the ‘ glamorous ’ image painted in videos online			1
they spend months training with terrorists and then return to the @entity3			0
some videos have graphic pictures , videos and blogs posted by others on the chaotic frontline			2
they include videos of masked militants , deadly firefights and bomb explosions set to music as well as horrific images of victims , including children			1
last november extraordinary pictures emerged of @entity3 jihadists fighting alongside @entity126 - linked gangs in @entity8			1
one man referred to fighting in @entity8 as ‘ 5 - star jihad ’ because of its ‘ relaxing ’ nature			1
around 400 @entity3 are believed to have gone to @entity8 over the past two years with about 20 killed			2
counter-terrorism chiefs have repeatedly highlighted the dangers posed to the @entity3 by fighters returning here after training with terrorists in @entity8 .			2
