@entity0 launches the first column from @entity3 star @entity2 ahead of the new season			2
the @entity6 man will bring you his latest views ahead of each race during the campaign			1
firstly , let me begin by saying , it is great to be a columnist for @entity14 and i look forward to you joining me on my trip around the @entity3 world this season			2
i hope you enjoy my work , and please give me some feedback on @entity20			0
ahead of the first race , and even before we got to pre-season testing , the main thing i had to do was lose weight over the winter because the cars are so much on the limit this year			1
i had to go through a strict diet programme			1
it is tough because it is easy to just diet , but if i need to diet and become really fit through physical training , it becomes quite difficult			1
i have n't had any sugar for months now , and at first it was tough			1
raring to go : @entity2 will start the @entity3 season among the favourites to win the championship on track : the @entity6 car is expected to set the pace this season following a promising winter of testing the new weight regulation is just one in a huge overhaul of the sport 's rules this season , and there are two sides to the new regulations			1
it is good the sport has gone to more efficient energy , for example , as it is important to follow the direction of the rest of the world			0
at the same time however , the cars are slower , which i do n't like			1
as a driver you want to go faster and faster , but this year we are slower and that is a bit of a pity			1
to drive , they are quite similar to previous years but what is different is the new technology			0
there is so much that we have had to get used to and it is complicated			0
the whole steering wheel , for instance , is custom made			0
i now have a smart phone display on the steering wheel and i was also able to put the buttons wherever i wanted , so that was already a complicated process in itself			0
the team helped me a lot , but it has been time consuming to get it right			2
in the spotlight : @entity2 admits he had to lose weight over the winter , sticking to a strict diet programme new challenge : the 28 - year - old says this year 's cars are slower and more complicated than previous seasons i am hoping that we will be towards the front in @entity96 , but where we are going to be exactly , i do n't know			1
we must remember that reliability is on the edge for every team at the moment			1
it is going to be so tough just to get to the end of the race			2
the team have worked incredibly hard			2
they have been pulling all - nighters since the last test in @entity109 trying to fix the final bits and pieces			0
i was in the factory last week , and on thursday , at 9.30 in the evening , they were still flat out			0
that was in the engine department where they were still trying to produce some extra bits because the next morning the engines had to fly out to @entity119			0
they spent the night building them so they could make the deadline , so it is really , really on the edge			0
a lot of cars wo n't make it to the end of the race and there are going to be a lot of reliability problems			1
if it is too much it wo n't be good for the sport but it shows that everyone is on the limit and that is part of @entity3 - it always has been			2
claim : @entity144 team principal @entity143 ( right ) said that @entity6 could win sunday 's race by two laps at the first pre-season test in @entity149 you could n't really determine anything but in @entity109 you got a better gauge of where everyone was , and it became clear that we had a good car and were in a decent position			1
it is early days , and we have to remember last year that we were in a strong position after testing but in the races we were n't as good as we hoped			1
we need to be cautious , but we are optimistic			0
@entity144 team principal @entity143 has said we will win the opening race by two laps , but i would will be very careful about @entity164 's assessment			1
never underestimate @entity144 or the others			2
on @entity144 , it is always a surprise if they do n't waltz away with the victory because we have become so used to that from previous years			1
it is too early to say that is not going to happen here because they have surprised everybody before so we have to be very careful			0
@entity144 is @entity144 , and they are the benchmark and the best team , so we assume that they are going to be the benchmark again , but if not , then great			1
however , we are focused on ourselves and making sure we get the best out of what we have			0
what others do is not really in our control			0
i know i start among the title favourites but do i feel extra pressure this season ? no , not really			2
the opposite , in fact			0
the whole experience becomes even more enjoyable if the car is quick , and then the hope of having real success and sharing that with the team			0
partners : @entity195 and team - mate @entity2 are expected to go toe - to - toe for this year 's championship hot topic : @entity198 allowed @entity200 past to claim victory at the season - opening race in @entity119 back at the @entity205 , @entity204 drivers @entity200 and @entity198 had a deal in place in whichever driver got to the opening corner first would be allowed to win the race , but i would n't like that , and i do n't think the team would either , so we are going to try and avoid such measures			1
@entity195 and i have always been competing , even for championships , as far back as our karting days , so it wo n't be an unusual situation if that happens this year , and i am confident we will be able to handle it			1
it will be tough at times - that is normal - but we just need to keep on working it out			1
we still get on well , so that is a good thing			0
on my former @entity6 team - mate @entity228 , i wish him a strong recovery after his skiing accident in december			1
i am hoping for the best and also wishing his family strength			0
i am a big @entity234 fan			0
unfortunately i missed their match against @entity237 on tuesday , but i was very pleased they went through			0
they are an amazing team at the moment			0
it is so tough to win the @entity242 because you also need a lot of luck			2
skill wise they can do it , but they need the luck as well to win it for a second time			0
tribute : @entity2 and @entity228 were team - mates together at @entity6 for three seasons @entity2 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity256 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity3 mechanics and their families , putting @entity3 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			1
you can follow @entity2 on @entity20 @ nico_rosberg and @entity6 @ @entity268 .			2

do n't write off @entity144 's chances in @entity96 , even if principal @entity143 believes my team @entity6 will win by two laps
i *'m* relishing the pressure of being a championship *contender* this season
*competition* with @entity6 team - mate @entity195 will be tough at times
it 's a pity the cars are slower this year - as a driver you want to go faster and faster
the reliability of the new cars will be an issue and simply finishing races will be difficult
i have n't had any sugar for months because of a strict diet to lose weight
