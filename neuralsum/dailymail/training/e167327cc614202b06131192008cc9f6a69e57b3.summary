within three months of divorcing @entity5 ( left ) he had married the youngest of his four ' spiritual wives ' @entity8 ( right ) some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for @entity5 online , but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person			1
@entity0 and his wives first appeared in @entity0 in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices			0
all his wives except @entity6 were raised in polygamist families			0
but , @entity6 's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter , and is now in a plural marriage with @entity0 's dad the series led to the @entity0 family being investigated for possible prosecution although @entity0 believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman , and the other marriages are spiritual unions			1
