@entity1 @entity0 is out of the season ’s final major next week and the @entity3 in september after admitting he needs professional help			1
the big - hitting 30 - year - old , known for his colourful lifestyle , revealed in a dramatic statement on thursday night that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence			2
the @entity8 confirmed he wo n’t be part of the @entity1 team at @entity11			1
@entity0 finished 12th in @entity12 two weeks ago and was fourth in the @entity1 @entity3 standings			1
earlier this year , he got engaged to his glamorous fiancé @entity14			2
' as one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3 - 0 at @entity30 in 2012 , he has clearly been an asset for the @entity1 team			1
that said , the @entity1 is a team with an abundance of talent			1
' @entity0 ’s statement read : ' i am taking a leave of absence from professional golf , effective immediately			1
i will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges i have faced			2
by committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health , physical well - being and emotional foundation , i am confident that i will be better equipped to fulfil my potential and become a consistent champion			2
i respectfully ask for privacy as i embark upon this mission of self - improvement			0
’ talk about a statement that left more questions than answers , a point picked up by @entity54 captain @entity53 on @entity55			2
‘ it ’s much better for everyone if there is clarity , ’ he said			0
‘ if something has gone wrong and he has been misbehaving , let ’s get it dealt with and move forward			0
’ @entity0 was known for a party lifestyle that led to him being labelled an unfulfilled talent			1
at 17 he was arrested for buying bullets that were later used in a gangland murder			0
in 2009 he was in trouble again after being charged with @entity73 ( driving under the influence )			0
@entity75 : talented golfer @entity0 has had problems off the golf course in the past in may 2012 , @entity0 ’s agent @entity78 insisted his client had not been serving a drugs suspension from the @entity81 when he spent three months out of the game			1
his coach @entity83 was forthcoming in a 2011 interview , revealing : ' @entity0 and i had a come - to - @entity87 conversation about getting his personal life in order			1
i told him he needs to figure out who he is and how committed he is to utilizing his talent			0
he needs to eliminate some of the , shall we say , extracurricular activities			0
he ’s a fun - loving guy , i realize that			0
but there ’s a time to play and a time to work and he needs to understand that better			0
’ @entity0 seemed to have settled down since meeting @entity14 and was an impressive winner of the @entity98 tournament in @entity99 last november			1
now it is to be hoped he can sort out all his personal demons			0
all smiles : @entity0 ( right ) got engaged to @entity14 ( left ) earlier this year the news regarding @entity0 inevitably overshadowed proceedings on the opening day of the @entity106 here at @entity108 , where @entity110 @entity109 led the way after a 64 , with @entity112 shooting 65			1
@entity113 represented a veritable beacon of tranquillity amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over @entity3 places			1
earning a @entity119 will do that for a man , as the 25 year old threatened to carry on from where he left off at @entity124			0
back on the course : @entity113 in action during the @entity106 on thursday return : it was his first tournament back since his @entity12 victory at @entity124 @entity130 - 2014 as it turned out , an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed			1
this is one of two big events left to decide the automatic @entity3 placings on both sides of the @entity144 and boy , can you tell			2
@entity148 @entity147 , one of those sweating on a spot , summed it up nicely when he said : ’ you want to forget about it but all the time you ’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what ’s at stake			0
’ it would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old @entity148 missed out on a debut after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen			0
a two under par 68 , therefore , was a gusty effort			0
one shot nearer the lead was in - form @entity169 @entity168 , currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top three finish			0
@entity174 was looking for a good score to shore up his own parlous @entity3 position and did that with a 68			2
sweating : @entity147 is one of those chasing a @entity3 spot crouching @entity174 : woods lining up a putt on the second green during the first round at @entity106			1

@entity0 withdraws from all golf for the *foreseeable* future
@entity1 ruled out of september *'s* @entity3 at @entity11
shock statement overshadows day one at the @entity106
