enough is enough : energy minister @entity1 has called for an end to onshore wind farms a furious coalition row erupted today after a junior @entity6 minister declared that the relentless march of onshore wind farms is at an end			1
insisting ‘ enough is enough ’ , energy minister @entity1 said turbines had been ‘ peppered around the country ’ with little or no regard for local opinion			1
he said existing sites and those in the pipeline would be enough to meet green commitments with no need for more			2
‘ even if a minority of what ’s in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m saying enough is enough			0
’ but at an early - morning showdown with his boss - @entity26 energy secretary @entity25 - mr @entity1 was told he does not decide government policy			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity29 he had commissioned research on the impact of wind turbines on the landscape and whether they drive down house prices			1
he has also asked scientists to examine noise complaints and more sinister suggestions that the turbines endanger military aircraft by blocking radar signals			2
the intervention by mr @entity1 , who became energy minister in last month ’s reshuffle , will delight 100 - plus fellow @entity6 mps who have urged @entity45 to take a more sceptical approach to onshore wind power			1
it does however risk a clash with the @entity26 , who are enthusiastic advocates of renewable energy			1
a source close to mr @entity25 said today : ' @entity1 does not decide government policy			1
there will be no change			0
we are in a coalition government , not a single party government and definitely not a single minister government			2
' we are determined to make sure the coalition lives up to the prime minister ’s pledge to make it the greenest government ever			2
' at a meeting of ministers at the @entity66 this morning , mr @entity25 made clear his anger at mr @entity1			1
' @entity25 is of the opinion that he ultimately signs off renewables policy			2
he is the secretary of state			2
@entity1 is not in the @entity72 and he is not secretary of state , ' the source added			2
in a statement later mr @entity25 said : ' there has been no change to @entity78 policy on renewable energy , as collectively agreed by the @entity72			1
energy secretary @entity25 today slapped down mr @entity1 , insisting onshore wind has ' an important role to play ' in @entity82 ' onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables , which is why we ’ve been able to cut the subsidy			1
it has an important role to play in our energy future			2
' however mr @entity1 suggested the controversy over turbines was giving other sources of renewable power – such as offshore wind , solar and tidal power – a bad name			1
‘ the onshore wind debate is skewing the whole debate , which is not good for the government , not good for people and not good for the renewables lobby , ’ he told the @entity29			1
‘ we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities			2
i ca n’t single - handedly build a new @entity105 but i can protect our green and pleasant land			0
‘ firstly , i have asked the planning minister to look again at the relationship between these turbines and the landscape			0
‘ it seems extraordinary to have allowed them to be peppered around the country without due regard for the interests of the local community or their wishes			0
‘ we have issued a call for evidence on wind			0
that is about cost but also about community buy - in			0
we need to understand communities ’ genuine desires			0
’ mr @entity1 said policy should not be based on some ‘ bourgeois left article of faith ’			1
‘ these things are about the people and i am the people ’s minister , ’ he added			0
controversial : the energy minister said onshore wind farms are turning people against other sources of renewable energy such as offshore alternatives and solar power ‘ i want to look at a broader analysis of the effects – i mean house price values , and other quality of life issues			1
i want to look particularly at noise , so i have asked the @entity144 to look at the noise issue from a completely independent perspective			0
‘ there is a case where people had to move from their family farm because of noise			0
it is very often the case that local authorities do n’t have the wherewithal to address these planning issues			0
’ mr @entity1 said defence ministers had agreed to investigate claims of radar interference from the spinning blades			1
the government has set a target of increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms to 13 gigawatts by 2020			1
but in an indication of a shift in government policy , ministers announced this summer that the subsidy for onshore wind power generation would be cut by 10 per cent this year			1
approvals for onshore wind farms – around 3,800 turbines are in operation – have however reached record levels , according to figures published yesterday			1
@entity178 , the wind industry trade body , said in a statement : ‘ for the first time in five years , the @entity82 is seeing a rise in the amount of @entity82 capacity approved at a local level			0
’ there was a 15 per cent increase in approval rates for smaller onshore projects with capacity of less than 50 megawatts last year compared with the previous year , it said			0
applications for new wind farms have to be made to councils , and around a half are refused			1
but under the existing system , energy companies often win on appeal to the planning inspectorate			2
campaigners took heart from a court ruling in may , in which villagers in @entity206 , on the edge of the @entity204 , succeeded in blocking four 350ft turbines after a judge agreed their right to preserve their landscape was more important than renewable energy targets			1
@entity6 mp @entity214 , who has led calls for a rethink on wind power , said of mr @entity1 ’s remarks : ‘ this is a huge step forward			1
these awful turbines do nothing for the environment – they barely reduce @entity223 – they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty			0
‘ it ’s about time the government listened in this way			0
communities will be delighted that they may now be spared the torment they have seen others go through when turbines go up			0
’ former conservative chancellor @entity235 , an arch - sceptic on climate change , said : ‘ i would welcome the minister ’s statements			0
i would hope they would translate into a moratorium			0
an additional problem is that wind power is one of the most expensive forms of generating electricity there is			0
‘ at a time when there is so much concern both from households and industry about the cost of energy , that too should be a decisive argument against going this way			0
’ but @entity255 seized on the coalition row about the future of wind farms			1
@entity260 energy secretary @entity259 said : ' @entity82 needs a clean , diverse and secure energy supply – but this government appears clueless when it comes to delivering clean energy and fair bills			1
' with energy bills skyrocketing , what hard pressed people urgently want is action but instead we have a shambles of a @entity6 - led government which ca n't even agree with itself			0
' @entity274 energy campaigner @entity273 said : ' @entity1 ’ petulant outburst adds to the @entity72 ’s growing energy shambles and to a deepening divide within @entity78 between those who care about green growth and the economy and those who just want more oil and gas			2
' here is a new minister veering off brief and publicly contradicting his bosses			0
his comments threaten jobs and his approach will drive up energy bills			2

onshore wind farms give other renewable energy sources a bad name , energy minister @entity1 tells the @entity29
existing and planned sites are enough to meet environmental goals
research into effects on house prices , noise levels and military radars has been commissioned , said mr @entity1
comments spark a furious coalition row , with @entity26 energy secretary @entity25 insisting ' i *'m* in charge '
