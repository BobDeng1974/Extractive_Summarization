home again : @entity1 after landing at @entity2 @entity1 said yesterday that ‘ lives were at stake ’ during his escape from @entity6			1
he and fellow @entity9 presenters @entity7 and @entity10 had to hide under beds as an angry mob searched their hotel , he said			1
now safely back in the @entity15 , the motormouth tv host reverted to his trademark style , finding a tactless comment or two irresistible			0
he said the ‘ silver lining ’ to the ordeal was that it gave the show ’s @entity19 special a better ending than they had planned			0
@entity1 also said he would have chosen ‘ @entity26 ’ as his number plate ‘ if i ’d been trying to ruffle feathers ’			1
the trouble was started by a car number plate , @entity30 , which sparked fury among locals and war veterans who claimed it referred to the 1982 falklands conflict			1
yesterday @entity1 , 54 , said the @entity36 he drove during the special edition of the @entity39 motoring show arrived in @entity6 with the @entity30 plates , but they were removed two days later after a @entity42 user pointed out the problem			1
by the time the stars reached @entity45 , south @entity6 , the car ‘ had no plate at all on the front and a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers on the back , ’ he wrote in @entity53			1
' and no , it was n’t @entity26			0
which it would have been if i ’d been trying to ruffle feathers ’			0
he added : ‘ the number plate then was n’t the issue , but something was causing more and more people to arrive at the hotel			2
@entity42 was rammed with messages from locals saying they wanted blood			0
one said they were going to barbecue us and eat the meat			0
’ @entity1 said he , @entity7 and may ‘ hid under the beds in a researcher ’s room while protesters went through the hotel looking for us ’			1
government officials told the @entity9 crew they were no longer welcome and that their safety ‘ could not be guaranteed ’			1
yesterday @entity1 accused the government of allowing the visit simply to ‘ make political capital from ejecting us when we arrived ’			1
controversy : the number plate that caused offence and led to a violent reaction from @entity6 backlash : the @entity9 team 's cars were attacked , including @entity10 's red lotus , above the controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the @entity39 received it for filming , a spokesman for the show said			1
the h at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991			0
@entity30 , the last three letters , represent where the vehicle was first registered			2
in this case it was @entity103 in @entity104			0
the numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the @entity107			0
@entity36 confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at @entity9 , but from a private owner			1
it is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £ 80			0
plates beginning in @entity115 or q - @entity116 registered vehicles - can not be transferred			0
motorists can not transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger			2
filming took place near @entity123 port from which the @entity124 sailed before it was sunk by a @entity15 submarine			0
there were questions about the attack ’s legitimacy as the @entity6 ship was outside the exclusion zone			2
@entity1 said the team knew anti-british feelings were still strong there so ‘ were on our best behaviour ’			2
but they faced ‘ mobs with pickaxe handles , paving stones and bricks ’			1
he , @entity7 , and may and the women in the team flew to @entity143 , thinking the stars ’ absence would calm things			0
but it did not and the remaining 29 crew members had to escape to @entity149 by car , including the @entity36			2
bricks were thrown at the vehicles and two people were cut by flying glass			0
@entity155 spread that an ambush was awaiting them			0
@entity1 said : ‘ the nine of us who had escaped were … working through the night to find a plane and an airfield from which they could get out because , make no mistake , lives were at stake			1
’ the crew abandoned the cars and , ‘ chased by the thugs ’ , fled to a remote border crossing into @entity149			2
@entity6 papers said @entity1 ’s comments , blaming the government for the attack , were ‘ a new provocation ’ .			1

@entity1 and @entity9 crew *hounded* out of @entity6 by a mob
forced to abandon cars by side of road and leave country three days early
@entity1 says presenters hid under bed from the *rampaging* mob
@entity1 's @entity30 plate was taken as a reference to the 1982 conflict
called it a *coincidence* , and would *'ve* used @entity193 if he *'d* wanted to offend
@entity9 convoy was attacked with rocks , sticks and pickaxe handles
@entity6 officials have demanded a *written* *apology* from @entity1
said the *licence* plate on the car was a ' provocation ' and ' very *big* offence '
@entity1 claims they allowed visit just to ‘ make political capital ' by ejecting them
