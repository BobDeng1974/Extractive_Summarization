@entity0 have jetted off to @entity1 for a break ahead of what @entity3 believes are the 10 biggest matches in the club 's history			1
@entity0 ' late , and somewhat fortuitous , victory against @entity9 on tuesday evening got them back to winning way after their remarkable season started to go off kilter			1
the latest in a line of disjointed displays looked set to cost @entity16 's men , only for @entity17 to strike late on to secure a 1 - 0 win which moved them back to within a point of the top - four			1
@entity3 ( front ) uploaded an image to @entity22 of the @entity0 team on the plane @entity17 ( centre ) scores the decisive goal as @entity0 beat @entity9 1 - 0 on tuesday @entity0 manager @entity16 has taken the squad to @entity1 fora team break it means @entity32 qualification remains a realistic - and scarcely - believable - prospect for @entity0 , whose players flew to @entity1 on wednesday for a break ahead of what @entity3 knows is a crunch period			1
' i think it will be great to just have a good time , the pressure of the @entity41 is massive , especially where we are in the table , ' the midfielder said			0
' it 's good to get away , put our feet up and have a bit of a laugh with the group			0
it should be a good bit of fun and then we 'll move on from there ' these next 10 games are probably the biggest in the club 's history and we 're determined as a group of players to make history for the club			2
' we want to get us to the biggest stage in the world where we feel we belong with the best teams and best players in the world			0
' next up for @entity0 is the unenviable task of a trip to @entity69 on march 15 - a match @entity70 will hope to be starting after his telling impact against @entity9			1
the @entity75 under 21 midfielder was brought on in a bid to inject some fresh impetus into @entity0 ' toiling attack and had the desired impact , producing the shot which led to @entity17 clipping home			2
' we reflected on the win in the changing room and we believe it 's going to be a pivotal three points come the end of the season , ' @entity3 told @entity0 's official @entity89 channel ' we have n't been on the best of runs lately and it 's great to obviously get the three points and move forward			1
you could feel the whole stadium was pleased			0
' it was n't a pretty performance , not a vintage @entity0 display , but we dug deep , the fans got behind us and i think we showed great character			2
' @entity0 's displays have been inconsistent lately but @entity17 's goal keeps their @entity32 hopes @entity70 believes the final 10 league games of the season are the biggest in @entity0 's history while @entity70 deserved credit for the run and shot that led to @entity17 's goal , it would not have got that far had @entity111 dealt with the initial attempt			1
the long - serving @entity9 goalkeeper could only parry @entity3 's shot into the @entity117 winger 's path , but defender @entity118 stood up for his team - mate after the costly mistake			1
' you ca n't just point the finger at @entity123 , ' he said			2
' he has kept us in games at times this season and he will carry on making important saves for us			0
@entity118 refused to criticise goalkeeper @entity111 for spilling the ball into the path of @entity17 for the goal ' @entity123 said he should have done better but these things happen and we should have reacted better			0
' he is a great goalkeeper and has done really well for us			0
he made a couple of good saves last night and made some good decisions coming out when they played balls through			0
' these things happen but we 'll stick together as a team			0

@entity0 have 10 days off before their next game against @entity69
they beat @entity9 1 - 0 on tuesday to move a point off the top four
the squad are heading to @entity1 for a team break before the run - in
