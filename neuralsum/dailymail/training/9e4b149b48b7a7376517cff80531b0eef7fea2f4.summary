by @entity0 published : 10:18 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 10:18 est , 26 march 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 yesterday resumed analysis of a sample of rock powder following a computer glitch that suspended operations for a week			1
before the computer problem , results radioed back to @entity10 revealed that the rock , located near @entity1 's @entity13 landing site , contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for microbial life , the over-arching goal of the planned two - year mission			1
scientists are eager for additional information about the rock sample , which was drilled out from what appears to be a slab of bedrock in an area known as @entity25			0
after back - to - back computer problems , the six - wheel curiosity rover , seen in this self - portrait , has resumed its science experiments curiosity automatically suspended its work on march 17 when it detected a problem with a computer data file			2
the glitch occurred as the rover was recovering from an earlier , unrelated computer problem			2
the unplanned work hiatus ended over the weekend , @entity2 's deputy project manager @entity37 said			2
' it 's a slow recovery process , but we 're back doing science , ' @entity37 said			0
analysis of the rock powder will continue for about another week			0
beginning april 4 , radio communications between @entity10 and @entity45 will be blocked by the sun for a month , suspending most of the rover 's science operations again			1
driller thriller : @entity1 drilled a 2.5in - hole on february 8 to take its @entity45 planet sample - next to it is a shallower hole where the rover conducted its test drilling a sample of powdered rock extracted by @entity1 , shown after the sample was transferred from the drill to the rover 's scoop when the planets re-align for communications after may 1 , scientists plan to drill a second hole into the rock to verify the early results and look more closely for signs of organic carbon			1
the Â£ 2billion rover landed on @entity45 on august 6 to assess if the planet most like @entity10 has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life			0
scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a 3 - mile ( 5 - km ) high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of @entity13 .			0

one of the rover 's two *onboard* computers had become *corrupted*
@entity2 had suspended operations , placing @entity1 in a ' safe mode '
