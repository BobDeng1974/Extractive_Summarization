by @entity0 published : 04:33 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 14:38 est , 27 august 2012 @entity1 , 44 , has a medical condition which can cause up to 100 orgasms a day some people fake them , others ache for them but for one woman , the big ' o ' is the bane of her life ... as she has to endure up to 100 orgasms a day			1
@entity1 , 44 , has a medical condition which makes her feel constantly aroused			1
even the slightest pelvic movement - on a train , in a car , doing domestic chores - can trigger a climax , but the sheer volume has left her tired , in pain and unable to have a normal relationship			1
ms @entity1 , a nurse originally from @entity20 , @entity21 , suffers from @entity22 ( @entity22 )			1
doctors believe the incurable syndrome was caused by an accident in 2001 when she fell down some stairs			1
this may have led to a @entity29 cyst on her spine , at the point where a woman 's orgasm originates			2
' other women wonder how to have an orgasm - i wonder how to stop mine , ' she told @entity39 ms @entity1 , who has since moved to @entity40 , @entity41 , first noticed the problem in 2008 after having sex with a new boyfriend			1
she said : ' i had constant orgasms for four days			1
i thought i was going mad			2
' we tried everything to make it stop			2
squats , deep breathing , i even sat on frozen peas but the orgasms and sexual arousal continued for 36 hours - i must have had around 200 orgasms during that period			1
the pain and exhaustion was excruciating			2
' ms @entity1 said she now finds it hard to go about her daily life as she is worried she will not be able to control the sexual arousal			1
she said she no longer feels like she has control over her own body : ' imagine feeling aroused for no reason other than you got up that day			2
' i 've even had one in public			2
i was travelling home on the train and it was a bit of a bumpy ride			2
' every jerk of the train or vibration made me more aroused and it was a 40 - minute journey so there was nothing i could do			0
' i just had to bite my lip and sit on my hands and hope no one noticed			0
' although the sensations experienced during @entity22 may seem like arousal , they are not actually based in any sexual desire , thoughts or behaviour , and it is unconnected to libido			1
any pressure on the genitals can result in increased intensity - and also bring on the urge to urinate			0
due to shame , guilt and fear of rejection , it is not clear how many people have the condition , as some patients may suffer in silence			0
ms @entity1 added : ' both women and men just do n't seem to get it - they seem to think it 's a great thing and , believe me , it 's really not			1
' even a train journey has become a nightmare for ms @entity1			1
she said : ' every jerk of the train or vibration made me more aroused and it was a 40 - minute journey so there was nothing i could do ' ( file photo ) despite going to several specialists about her condition , doctors remain unable to help			0
the condition is very rare and there has so far been very little research into it			0
ms @entity1 only received an official diagnosis , in @entity119 , in june and will travel to @entity120 next month to see a @entity22 expert			1
she said : ' at the moment i am able to work			0
but without the correct treatment this condition can limit my ability to work			0
i do n't want that			0
it 's already destroyed my chance of having a relationship			0
' dr @entity130 , an expert on sexual medicine at @entity132 in @entity120 said : ' persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition , where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire			0
' pgad sufferers experience intrusive , unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting			0
this arousal can persist for hours , days or even longer			0
' this can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm , this often does n't help or can worsen the symptoms			0
' @entity29 cysts are small jelly like cysts that form around the sacral area of the spine			0
they are a common finding in normal people			0
one current research paper suggests that a lot of women who have @entity22 have @entity29 cysts , but this is contentious			1
' there is very little research into @entity29 cysts and @entity22			1
but due to the relatively high occurrence of @entity167 cysts currently observed in women who suffer from @entity22 symptoms , it would seem advisable to suspect @entity29 cysts as a possible underlying factor in the cause of @entity22			1
' @entity29 cysts can cause problems with the pelvic nerves and are reported to produce genital symptoms that bear similarities to those described for @entity22			1
' spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it 's those women who ca n't control the arousal which is uncommon			0
' i see around 20 women a year with this condition , it may be as common as one in 100 we just do n't know			0
' sometimes it may resolve on its own , there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient			2
