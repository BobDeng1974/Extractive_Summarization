@entity1 mps have criticised the government for being ‘ blind ’ to the soaring threats @entity4 faces and accused it of freeloading off the @entity5			1
former @entity7 captain @entity6 said yesterday that the @entity4 was ‘ ignoring the lessons of history at our peril ’ by refusing to commit to spend 2 per cent of national income on defence			1
he said claims that @entity4 boasts the world ’s fifth largest defence budget ‘ rings hollow ’ when the @entity17 is slashing manpower and capabilities			2
@entity1 mp @entity6 , left , urged prime minister @entity20 to commit at least two per cent of the budget to defence spending as @entity5 general @entity23 warned over ' unthinkable ' cuts to the @entity7 the @entity25 and @entity27 mp said ‘ misguided military interventions ’ in the last decade , including @entity35 and @entity36 , had distracted the @entity4 from the ‘ greater danger of state on state ’ threats from countries such as @entity32			1
he added : ‘ failing defence budgets across @entity38 have emboldened the @entity32 president , who has concluded that the heart has gone out of the alliance			0
’ he called on the government to spend 3 to 4 per cent of national income on defence , saying it was ‘ nonsense ’ that on current projections @entity4 will be spending the same on defence as on foreign aid in 15 years			1
referencing comments made by the @entity5 chief of staff general @entity23 , he said the idea of @entity4 brigades serving within @entity5 divisions because of severe cuts to numbers was ‘ unthinkable ’ only a decade ago			2
a total of 37 mps , the majority of whom are @entity61 , backed a motion in @entity63 yesterday to set the defence budget at 2 per cent of national income in law , in a significant challenge to @entity20 just weeks ahead of the election			1
the motion , headed by mr @entity6 , was passed but has no legal force			2
@entity71 , chairman of the defence select committee , waded into the four - hour debate in the @entity74 , saying that @entity4 was acting as a ‘ freeloader ’ to the @entity5			2
he told @entity60 : ‘ these threats are real			0
the world is genuinely becoming more dangerous , and @entity4 can not be a freeloader			0
‘ people stand up and list all the different kit that we have bought , but they do not intend ever to use it			0
’ he added that ‘ they ’ were ‘ freeloading ’ by thinking ‘ that @entity4 will never act alone , that the @entity5 will somehow fill in all the gaps ’			0
mr @entity6 warned that @entity4 faced a significant threat from countries such as @entity32 he said that if the @entity4 was serious about defence , the government would need to look at ballistic missiles , upgrading elite units and protecting soldiers against chemical weapons with special suits			1
a study by the impartial @entity94 released this week revealed that current plans suggest defence spending will represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year			1
@entity1 mp @entity98 described the prime minister ’s suggestion that intelligence service spending could count towards the 2 per cent target as ‘ kindergarten economics ’			1
@entity1 @entity104 said @entity35 and @entity36 showed ‘ what happens when you try and deploy troops abroad on the cheap , without being properly equipped ’			0
mr @entity6 agreed : ‘ it took the @entity5 to put in another 20,000 troops before we pulled that situation round			0
we require armed forces of sufficient capability and capacity to respond to any challenge			0
