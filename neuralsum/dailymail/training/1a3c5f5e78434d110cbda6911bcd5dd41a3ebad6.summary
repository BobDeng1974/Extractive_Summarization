by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 13:04 est , 8 november 2012 updated : 03:03 est , 9 november 2012 the appointment of the new leader of the @entity4 turned to farce and suspicion yesterday amid allegations of a betting coup			1
as the @entity9 joined the ranks of those naming the @entity11 as the new archbishop of @entity13 , bookmakers accused churchmen of using insider knowledge to make money and suspended betting on the appointment			1
the odds on the @entity20 @entity19 dropped from 7/4 to an odds - on 1/2 in one day			0
there were said to have been several betting accounts opened by people in @entity25 , who then put money on dr @entity19 ' insider knowledge ' : major bookmaking firms closed their @entity13 books following a flood of bets backing the right reverend @entity19 ( left ) to replace dr @entity32 ( right ) as archbishop of @entity13 @entity34 , of @entity35 , said : ‘ heavens above , if it does turn out to be @entity19 , we wo n’t be surprised , but we will be left wondering whether anything is sacred			1
‘ this race always seems to end with a betting coup			0
in the space of less than an hour we had to cut the odds three times , so took the decision to close the book			0
’ he added : ‘ i do n’t know the motives of those who opened a new account just to bet on the new archbishop but i ’ll be looking up to see how many churches get new roofs in the coming months			0
’ @entity55 , of @entity56 , said : ‘ punters were backing @entity19 like defeat was out of the question			1
’ he added : ‘ the money we ’ve seen suggests an announcement is only moments away			0
‘ perhaps people thought we ’d be too preoccupied with events in @entity66 to spot a gamble on the next archbishop of @entity13			2
’ @entity69 demanded an inquiry , with one describing the appointment as ‘ a shambles ’			0
among those already congratulating dr @entity19 this week was @entity73 , the @entity74 mp who heads the @entity75 , of which dr @entity19 is a member			2
newcomer : @entity77 is the official residence of the archbishop of @entity13 the @entity9 reported that @entity79 has confirmed an announcement will be made today and sources have told the @entity82 that dr @entity19 is the new archbishop			1
yet @entity4 officials insisted the rumours were ‘ speculation ’			1
@entity87 mp @entity86 said : ‘ it ’s pretty shabby if someone had knowledge that @entity19 was on his way to becoming the archbishop and put a bet on it			1
‘ the whole system for appointing an archbishop is a complete shambles			0
i do n’t see why there has to be this secrecy around it			0
‘ it should be an open and transparent process			0
then you would not have a situation where people know about the appointment and do this kind of insider trading			0
’ bookmakers @entity35 and @entity56 stopped taking bets on the appointment following a flood of money backing the right reverend @entity19 @entity114 , @entity87 chairman of the @entity115 home affairs select committee , called for an inquiry			1
there has been growing frustration in the @entity4 at the secrecy and length of the appointment process			2
a committee to pick @entity32 ’s successor , the @entity126 , was set up in april			2
its failure to produce a name in public seven months later has led to rising criticism.one senior figure in the @entity4 ’s inner ruling group complained yesterday of being left in the dark while dr @entity19 ’s name was freely circulated outside the @entity4 .			1

bookmakers accused churchmen of taking *advantage* of insider knowledge to make money on the appointment of a new archbishop of @entity13
two firms closed betting on the appointment following a surge of cash backing the right reverend @entity19 as dr @entity32 ' successor
the @entity4 is *due* to announce the new archbishop *tomorrow* and insisted any talk of the outcome was still speculation
but well known @entity4 figures have already congratulated the @entity11 on being *awarded* the post
