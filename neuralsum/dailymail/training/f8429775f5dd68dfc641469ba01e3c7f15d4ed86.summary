by @entity0 and @entity1 retiring @entity3 senator @entity2 has gone out with a bang - labelling prime minister @entity4 as a ‘ sexist ’ and accusing the @entity5 of ‘ dog whistling ’ with its asylum seeker policies			1
speaking on her departure from federal parliament at the end of the month after seven years , senator @entity8 told the @entity12 she thought @entity14 's famous misogyny speech was ‘ powerful ’ and within context , ‘ brilliant ’			1
although , the former @entity17 president said mr @entity4 would have been better described by ms @entity14 as a ‘ subtle sexist ’ - one of many in federal politics			2
some of the opposition 's older mps still ‘ yearned for the life when proper mothers stayed home and looked after the children and proper fathers who had their slippers handed to them ’ , the mother - of - three said			0
senator @entity8 said she was also concerned by the government swinging too far to the right , particularly on issues such as asylum seekers , action against climate change and same - sex marriage			0
‘ i think the whole asylum seeker issue is sort of fraught with dog whistling , ’ she said , adding that she did not appreciate the language used by immigration minister @entity47 , particularly the term ‘ illegal maritime arrivals ’			0
meanwhile , ms @entity14 discussed on the @entity54 radio show in @entity55 what her reasoning was in deciding to deliver the ' misogyny speech ' to parliament in october 2012			2
but senator @entity8 conceded that mr @entity4 was more willing to listen to women 's views than many of her male colleagues during her time in office ' i think for me , the sense that after everything that i as the first woman prime minister had seen happen around me about gender and to me in that position , i was not going to stand there and get lectured about sexism			1
' ms @entity14 said she had the opportunity , as @entity74 ’s first female prime minister , to discuss sexism with other female heads of state , including @entity77			2
' i think for men , that conversation starts with : " what kind of leader will he be ? strong ? weak ? compassionate ? strident ? " and for women it starts with : " can she lead ? " and it 's a subtle but significant difference , ' she said			0
' yes we have talked about those things , @entity77 and i , and i 've had the opportunity to talk to some other leading women around the world about them			0
' senator @entity8 described former prime minister @entity14 's famous misogyny speech , which she delivered to parliament in 2012 ( pictured ) , as ' powerful ' and ' brilliant '			1
