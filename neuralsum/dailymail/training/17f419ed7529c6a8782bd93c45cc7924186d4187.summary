by @entity0 and @entity1 open all hours : the @entity3 is to open parcel delivery centres on sundays as part of a trial @entity3 yesterday revealed plans to tackle the boom in online shopping by delivering parcels and opening sorting offices on sundays			1
the move , which has been backed by unions , will be a relief to those who miss the post during the week and end up wasting their saturday mornings queuing at their local office to pick up a parcel			2
it is also a sign of the increasing importance of parcels to @entity3 – it handles more than one billion of them every year – which will today reveal its first annual financial results since it was privatised last october			2
as letters continue their serial decline because of text messaging , social media websites and email , the increasing popularity of online shopping means that parcels now account for more than half of the company ’s revenues			1
yesterday the @entity46 ’ @entity43 ( @entity42 ) , which bitterly opposed the privatisation of the company last year , welcomed the news but said working on a sunday must be voluntary and is negotiating a higher pay rate for those who choose to do so			2
at present , sorting offices are only open from monday to friday as well as saturday morning			1
starting this summer , around 100 of @entity52 ’s 1,400 busiest delivery offices will be open every sunday afternoon			1
if the pilot scheme proves successful , it will be expanded and become permanent			2
@entity55 , @entity3 ’s express parcel business , will start sunday deliveries next month when selected online retailers will be able to offer it to their customers			1
this will be open to around 97 per cent of @entity52 ’s addresses , but excludes @entity63 and some remote areas			1
the group have done a deal with the @entity43 ( @entity42 ) to secure the changes @entity3 will also trial delivering parcels between businesses within the @entity71 on sundays and open its distribution network later at the weekends			1
as a result , people who shop online at the weekend have a better chance of receiving their package on monday , rather than waiting until later in the week for it to arrive			1
@entity3 chief executive @entity79 said : ‘ through these new sunday services we are exploring ways to improve our flexibility and provide more options for people to receive items they have ordered online			1
‘ the support of the @entity42 has enabled us to respond quickly to a changing market			2
’ @entity3 chief @entity79 says the move will offer ' greater flexibility ' to people who order things online in a statement , @entity3 said : ‘ the investment in extended opening hours builds on the choices already available to people who are not at home when delivery is attempted			1
’ and @entity97 , managing director of @entity3 parcels , told @entity100 ’s today programme yesterday that parcels are ‘ a big part of our future ’			1
he added : ‘ letters remain extremely important to us , and will do for many years to come			0
parcels now represent over half of our revenue in the @entity52			1
’ @entity108 , the @entity42 ’s deputy general secretary , said : ‘ we appreciate that in order to stay competitive in a broadly unregulated sector @entity3 has to expand its services to its customers			0
we believe that offering sunday delivery and collection services is the right response from the company			2
‘ with ever - increasing numbers of people opting to shop online , sunday services are necessary to deal with the growing demand in parcel delivery			1
‘ the union is negotiating with @entity3 to ensure that postal workers who are affected by these changes receive good terms and conditions and , where appropriate , that work is performed on a voluntary basis			0
’ the first official postal service was formed when @entity130 was appointed ' master of the @entity132 ' by @entity133 in 1512 and the @entity3 was established in 1516			0
but the first public service was not created until more than a century later , during the reign of @entity136 , when letters began being carried between posts by ' post-boys '			0
@entity140 then fixed postal rates depending on number of pieces of paper and distance in 1657			0
in 1793 , official letter carriers were given a uniform of a scarlet coat and black hat			0
despite the new clothes making the men more look more respectable , they were primarily designed to stop them sneaking into pubs while on shift			0
the first railway postal carriage on which letters were sorted in transit was brought in 1838 , a system which continued until 2004			0
the world 's first adhesive stamp was brought in in 1840 , called the @entity162 , and 68 million were used in their first year			0
the first pillar boxes came in 1852 , and were originally green to blend in with the landscape , but red ones were brought in from 1874 after people complained of finding them difficult to locate			2
the first postcode came in 1959 before the @entity169 was changed from a government department to a statutory corporation by a 1969 act of @entity140			0
the current government then allowed for up to 90 per cent of @entity3 to be privatised , with at least 10 per cent of shares to be held by @entity3 employees			0
business secretary @entity176 was accused of selling the company off on the cheap after the original stock market price of £ 3.3billion rose to more than £ 5billion after the company was floated			0
there are now over 12,000 @entity169 branches and 52 @entity55 depots around the country .			0

around 100 delivery offices around the @entity52 to open on sunday afternoons
express parcels to @entity188 will be delivered on sundays from next month
the changes come because more people are *buying* *products* online
@entity195 chief says new trial is part of plans to offer ' more flexibility '
