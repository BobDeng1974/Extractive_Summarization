ahead of @entity3 's trip to @entity4 on sunday afternoon @entity1 's @entity0 gives his thoughts on the big game at the @entity7			1
@entity9 ’s @entity7 blues the last time @entity4 ’s @entity12 midfielder @entity11 won a match at the @entity7 , @entity10 was making his debut for the home side			1
@entity11 scored in a 3 - 1 @entity3 win in september 2008 but was an unused substitute when @entity3 twice played there last season			2
now , he ’s a @entity4 player , albeit temporarily , and if he plays on sunday it will be his home debut for the club			1
@entity11 , in action against @entity23 last week , could make his @entity4 home debut against his former side @entity3 on saturday diego the difference @entity27 has already scored seven @entity29 goals , @entity30 managed only five in the whole of last season			1
@entity3 are going goal crazy in general at the moment			0
they have scored 15 in their four @entity29 games — last season the tally was four			0
@entity27 celebrates scoring for @entity3 against @entity38 earlier this season @entity4 ’s fair sheik ? @entity41 supports the rules on financial fairplay , @entity40 does n’t			1
city manager @entity44 is sympathetic to his boss , who has been ordered to rein in spending even though the club have no debts			0
‘ i understand if you have a big unpaid debt , you should be punished			0
but this is a club that does n’t have a debt of one pound to anyone , ’ said @entity44			0
@entity44 believes clubs like @entity4 should n't face @entity57 punishment if they have no debt compatriot games some @entity62 colleagues will be sworn enemies			0
@entity4 ’s @entity65 captain @entity64 will be out to stop compatriot @entity66			0
@entity3 ’s @entity68 and @entity4 ’s @entity67 shared the shame of losing 7 - 1 to @entity70 with @entity71			2
@entity64 will be keen to get one over @entity73 compatriot @entity66 and title rivals @entity3 @entity75 misses out how many englishmen will start the biggest match of the @entity29 season so far ? probably only three — @entity78 ( @entity4 ) , @entity79 and @entity80 ( both @entity3 )			1
though @entity4 duo @entity81 and @entity11 will hope to see action at some point			2
@entity4 keeper @entity78 will be one of the only @entity85 players on show at the @entity7 on sunday			2

@entity11 could make his home debut for the champions @entity4 against former side @entity3
@entity11 spent *13* years at @entity91 prior to departing this *summer*
in - form *striker* @entity27 could prove to be the difference at the @entity7 as the two title rivals meet on sunday
