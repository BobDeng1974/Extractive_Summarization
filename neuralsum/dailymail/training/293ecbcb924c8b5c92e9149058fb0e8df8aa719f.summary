it was not so long ago that @entity1 was saying he had been made a better manager , and a better person , by @entity4			1
he was talking , firstly , about his unquestionable talent as a footballer but , more importantly , @entity1 referred to the inspirational power of @entity4 ’s personal growth last season			1
so @entity11 ’s manager has every right to feel cheated , as do a lot of other people			1
and not just cheated out of his best player for close to three months at the start of next season , either			1
@entity36 were correct to mete out a punishment that reached beyond the boundaries of international football when @entity4 bit an opponent for the third time in his career , playing for @entity23 on tuesday			1
yet , for @entity1 , the betrayal does not stop there			1
he has been personally cheated , too , because he invested emotionally in what we now know was a lie			0
like many in the @entity50 game , from the dressing - room to the press box , he was fooled into thinking he had witnessed one man ’s capacity to change for the better			2
he thought he had seen a journey , an epiphany , a powerful redemption			0
he thought he was a better person , a more valuable person , for the rehabilitation of @entity4			2
and now it all seems false			0
events in @entity63 this week will cast a shadow over the advances made by @entity11 last season , because it will be a while before the club can trust again			1
the footballer can be replaced - although not like for like - but not the faith			2
all for nothing ? @entity1 thought he was more valuable for rehabilitating @entity4 but now it all seems false if @entity4 goes one month , one season , one year , unblemished , what does it mean , what will it matter ? he will work a lifetime trying to put right his behaviour at this @entity25 because everything he says , or does , from here will be met with scepticism			1
no one will buy the sham of a reformed @entity4 any more			2
no one will judge the performances , without also considering the man			0
for all the cant from several quarters about a vendetta in the @entity91 media , @entity4 won the @entity92 at the end of last season , having started it suspended for biting @entity97 ’s @entity96			1
as @entity1 remarked in a speech on @entity4 ’s behalf , it is part of @entity91 nature to forgive			1
@entity103 actions bad for everyone - @entity104 flashpoint : @entity4 holds his teeth in pain after appearing to bite @entity19 during @entity23 's 1 - 0 win referee ! @entity96 explains what happened after @entity4 appeared to have bitten him back in 2012 @entity4 was a popular winner			1
he was respected and admired , not just for the exceptional quality of his play , but for his new maturity			0
it is not just @entity117 voters who are suckers for a moving back story			0
@entity4 had grown from a dark soul , a player who did and said the most despicable things , to one who embodied the game at its finest			2
he has always played beautifully but now had a serenity to match			0
no diving , no biting , no vile words designed to wound			0
he made the people believe			0
and then , when they were at their most trusting and vulnerable , he revealed it was all an act			0
fooling us all : @entity4 's bite on @entity19 reveals the frontman 's good behaviour last season was all an act stellar season : @entity1 ( left ) said it had been a privilege to work with @entity4 after the frontman scooped the @entity143 's @entity142 ( right ) there will be predictable howls at @entity36 ’s punishment and its extension to his club career			1
@entity4 , after all , was not banned from playing for @entity23 when suspended by the @entity149			1
yet the @entity149 is an organisation under the umbrella of @entity36			2
the bigger body can pass its rulings down , the smaller body can not pass its rulings up			0
it is unfortunate that @entity11 , who have worked so hard at reforming @entity4 ’s unpalatable excesses , are now punished beside @entity23 - who have done nothing but indulge and excuse him , and shamefully so since last tuesday			1
yet what else was there to do ? the evidence was plain			0
if @entity4 has not transgressed in @entity50 football since the @entity96 incident it is only because the @entity149 have threatened draconian punishment			1
what option did @entity36 have , then , other than to adopt the same policy ? a ban from international football alone would not have stopped a potential move to @entity172 or @entity173 this summer			1
indeed , the absence of regular commutes between @entity176 and @entity177 would almost have made @entity4 more appealing			2
unfortunate : @entity11 have worked hard to help reform @entity4 but are now being punished and what message would that send if a player who had brought the @entity25 into disrepute then became the most expensive signing of the summer ? @entity36 had to include @entity11 in their reckoning if any penalty was not to become worthless			1
is it enough ? some might even argue he has got off lightly			0
the ban from all competition could have lasted two years , according to @entity36 ’s rules			2
in the circumstances , certainly the recidivism , four months globally and nine games in internationals , seems fair			0
it is harsh enough to hurt @entity4 , not so ferocious that it destroys his career			2
it leaves room for rehabilitation , enough time for the player to change , to grow , to be redeemed			0
whether anyone is interested in viewing this sequel is another matter			0
@entity204 can only be suspended so far even in horror show audiences			0
dracula has risen from the grave ? not this time , bub .			0

@entity4 has been banned for nine matches and banned from all football for four months by @entity36
the *controversial* @entity11 *striker* has been punished for biting @entity19 on the *shoulder* during @entity23 's win over @entity215 at the @entity25
@entity11 manager @entity1 will now have to face the first three months of the 2014 - 2015 @entity218 season without @entity4
