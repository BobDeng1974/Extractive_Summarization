but the haunting footage , captured in @entity9 , in @entity10 , disguises the horrific reality of what has just happened			0
@entity2 is no desperate father giving the kiss of life to his 15 - month - old step - child			1
instead , he is the perverted monster who abused @entity18 so badly that she died of her injuries			1
yesterday , a judge sitting at @entity21 branded the 33 - year - old 's crimes despicable			1
he described the december 2009 murder as ' almost beyond understanding			0

speaking only through his barrister , he alleged that ms @entity18 did not want social services involved because she had done these ' terrible things ' herself			2
but in a case with no forensic evidence to suggest who inflicted @entity18 's injuries , the jury rejected @entity2 's claims and accepted that ms @entity18 had unwittingly let a monster into her home , taking just three hours to reach a unanimous verdict			1
he was found guilty of murder , sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm			0
ms @entity18 sobbed as she was cleared of allowing her daughter 's death through willful neglect			1
