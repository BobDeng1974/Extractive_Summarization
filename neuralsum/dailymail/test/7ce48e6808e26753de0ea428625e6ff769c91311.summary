a young woman who thought she was doing her grocery alone made a surprising discovery after finding a mildly venomous snake curled up in her shopping trolley			1
the unnamed woman , from the @entity6 , found an empty trolley in an underground car park at the supermarket giant @entity9 in @entity10 , north of @entity11 on wednesday			2
she pushed the trolley up the escalator to do her shopping before realising the slithering brown tree snake had curled itself in the corner and was hitching a ride to the store			1
@entity21 24/7 @entity18 was called to remove the snake and release it back into the bushland just kilometres away			1
a young woman made a surprising discovering after finding a mildly venomous snake in her shopping trolley snake catcher @entity18 came to the rescue and safely removed the sleepy little snake outside the store ' the woman found it through a pile of trolleys downstairs and pushed it up the escalator before realising the sleepy little snake was there the whole time , ' mr @entity18 told @entity36			1
' she quickly alerted staff and they had a security guide standing 10 metres around it to keep an eye on it because they did n't know what type of snake it was			0
' when i arrived , it was n't causing any trouble , especially when i untangled it from the trolley			2
' as the weather begins to drop to cooler temperatures in @entity53 , mr @entity18 said brown tree snakes are nocturnal so they try to hide in warm areas			1
' they usually try to find somewhere warm to sleep , ' he said			0
' it probably wanted to stay away from trouble and thought the trolleys were a good place to climb inside and hang there - it had no idea it was a trolley			2
mr @entity18 later joked on his @entity65 page : ' i told the snake to next time try coming through the delivery door out back			1
' the brown treet snake was safely removed from the trolley after it had a little adventure up an escalator while brown tree snakes are known to kill their prey by chewing to inject venom , mr @entity18 said they are not regarded as dangerous to humans			1
' they 're mildly venomous and i still do n't advise anyone to pick it up , ' mr @entity18 said			1
' @entity81 tree snakes are not a threat and wo n't react in a threatening way but if you do get bitten , a pressure bandage should be applied and seek medical attention - as a precaution as with all suspected snake bites			2
' we had one situation where a dad thought it was a good idea to catch a snake inside his house and give it to his seven - year - old daughter to play with the next day because he thought it was harmless			0
' even though she was bitten and did n't show any signs of venom - i still advised him to take her to the hospital as a precautionary measure			0
' but please , if you 're not 100 percent certain about a snake - do n't do what this person did			0
' mr @entity18 said while they release venom on its prey , the snakes are not regarded as dangerous to humans mr @entity18 said brown tree snakes are harmless and nocturnal , so they try to hide in warm areas when it doubt about spotting a snake , mr @entity18 suggests the best thing to do in a situation is move away slowly and try to take a photograph from a safe distance			1
' send it to us and we can identify it for you and if it ’s venomous or not - or whether we need to come out to catch it ourselves and relocate them , ' he told @entity36			0
' if the snake is found inside a home in one of the rooms , it 's best to close the room and pop a towel underneath the door and then call us - nothing worse than having someone run out and lock their entire house and then tell us that " the snake is somewhere inside the house "			0
' if you 're in the garden and you step on a snake and it 's in between your legs , just stand still because it 'll eventually slither away			0
‘ be smart about it because 90 percent of the time , people who are bitten are often trying to kill it or scare it away			0
‘ all snakes want to do is get away but if it does n’t feel it can escape , it ’ll strike – so be sensible when you spot them			0
