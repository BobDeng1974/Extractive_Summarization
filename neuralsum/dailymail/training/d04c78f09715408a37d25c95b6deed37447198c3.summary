@entity0 are expecting such a low crowd for monday ’s @entity3 third - round tie at home to @entity5 that one of the stands at @entity8 has been completely shut			1
attendances for the club ’s @entity11 games at home this season are around the 20,000 mark			0
however , it is understood that approximately 6,000 tickets had been sold by sunday , with a quarter of those being bought by @entity5 fans			1
more than 35,000 watched the two teams play in the league at @entity21 a fortnight ago , but @entity0 anticipated poor ticket sales for this game and took the decision to close the @entity25 some time ago			1
@entity0 are expecting such a small crowd for their clash with @entity5 they are closing a stand at @entity8 @entity29 and @entity0 will host @entity5 at @entity8 in their @entity3 third round clash @entity0 ( probable , 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity41			1
@entity5 ( probable , 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity42 ; @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52			2
even though this is the club ’s first @entity3 tie at home in four years , the poor response has been blamed on the game being moved to a day when many people are just returning to work after @entity58			2
the move brought an angry reaction from fans ’ groups , although @entity0 are still expecting a healthy number of supporters to buy tickets on the day			1
chief executive @entity66 has defended the decision to play on a monday and close the stand , claiming the decision was made with police and stewarding resources in mind as well as the fitness of @entity29 ’s squad			0
he said : ‘ there are a lot of fixtures over the @entity58 and @entity79 period and to maximise player recovery time , monday is an optimal day to play			0
‘ we are sure that the long - term goal shared by all fans is to have a full squad capable of being competitive in all competitions			0
with regard to the @entity88 closure , this is based purely on the historical lack of demand for tickets for cup matches in the early stages			0
' if supporters purchase enough tickets to indicate there is a demand for opening additional stands for this game , we will happily open the stand			0
’ @entity102 's @entity5 side have won five of their last six games in all competitions @entity106 is lifted in the air after scoring his side 's third goal in their 3 - 3 draw with @entity111			2

@entity0 will face @entity5 in their @entity3 third round clash
but the hosts are expecting a small crowd for the match at @entity8
one of the stands at the ground will be completely closed as a result
