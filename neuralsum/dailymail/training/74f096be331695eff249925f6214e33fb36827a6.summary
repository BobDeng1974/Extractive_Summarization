by @entity1 reporter a law passed by @entity3 500 years ago could force villagers to foot repair bills for their parish church , despite rarely stepping inside the ancient building			1
three homeowners from sleepy @entity9 , near @entity10 , @entity11 , have been caught out by the archaic legislation , which states that they are legally obliged to fund repairs costs at @entity14			1
the original ' chancel repair liabilities ' rule dates back to the 1530s and was altered by @entity3 's dissolution of the monasteries			2
the local @entity20 of @entity14 , in @entity9 , @entity21 , has issued letters to residents informing them they are liable to pay for the church 's upkeep , withing days of the law expiring without such a warning when people bought land taken from monasteries , they became ' lay rectors ' and had a duty to help repair their local church			1
the government looked to abolish the law 10 years ago and gave churches a decade , until october 13 this year , to register properties for chancel repair liability with the land register otherwise they would not be able to make a future claim			1
with just three weeks before that 10 - year deadline passes , and the local parochial church council has issued letters to people whose properties have historical liability to upkeep the church			1
homeowner @entity47 , whose farmhouse is less than 600 yards away from the church , said : ' it 's utterly terrifying to know that if anything goes wrong with the church , we would be asked to cough up			0
churches were unlikely to be able to make claims against residents using the law from @entity57 realm ( pictured ) , unless they registered all liable properties by october 13 ' it 's an open cheque book and could bankrupt us if anything serious goes wrong			1
' we feel victimised and angry			0
it is such an old law and one that should be quashed			0
' we want to pass the house on to our children for another 100 years			0
our children are the future of this village , but the church certainly wo n't be getting our support			0
' chancel repair liability relates to the historic responsibility for the upkeep of a church being divided between the rector and @entity74 ' responsibilities were eventually transferred by legislation to the church			1
rectors have historically remained responsible for the upkeep and when their lands were sold , responsibilities were transferred to the new landowners			0
these lands need not necessarily be adjacent to church property			0
under the @entity83 ( @entity20 ) has the power to serve a demand for the cost or contributions for repairing the church chancel			1
in the event that the owner fails to pay then the @entity20 can enforce the demand through the courts			0
around one third of parish churches may be entitled to recover cost of repairs from neighbours who own all or part of church 's historical land			0
finding out if a property sits on former church land and therefore carries this responsibility can be timely due to @entity105 data checks			0
legislation in place since 2003 has given @entity20 's until october 13 , 2013 to register chancel repair liability against affected properties , which should then be informed			1
according to @entity112 , its lawyers understand that any @entity20 's which fail to register properties and inform owners by october 13 , 2013 , will not be able to make claims against them			1
however , according to a the @entity119 of the @entity120 , churches may be able to make claims even if they have not registered liable properties			1
it states : ' but even if the liability is not registered within the ten - year period ( oct 2003 - oct 2013 ) , it will still be enforceable after the expiration of that period against the owner of the land until he or she disposes of it			1
' @entity132 , 49 , found out she was subject to the historic chancel repair liabilities rule by letter from the @entity20 of @entity135 's - and is now desperately looking for a way out of it			2
@entity132 , whose home is closest to the church , said : ' i am terrified as it just does n't seem fair - i do n't even go to the church			2
churches need work all the time			0
how am i going to afford that ? ' @entity132 bought her house in @entity146 seven years ago and was unaware of the law - neighbour @entity147 inherited the hall , which has been in his wife 's family for more than 80 years			2
due to the size and amount of land on @entity147 's property , he is liable to pay up to 50 per cent of costs			2
the law only came to light in 2003 when married couple @entity159 and @entity160 were told they had to pay £ 100,000 to fund repairs of their ecclesiastical parish 's medieval church at @entity165			0
when they tried to challenge the demands , the @entity166 found in favour of the @entity20 , leaving the couple with a £ 350,000 bill including legal costs			0
they also had to pay a further £ 36,000 to ensure they were not liable in future			0
the government then passed legislation to amend the law , giving churches a 10 - year window to register properties , otherwise losing rights to make claims			1
the roof was replaced at @entity14 ten years ago but no claim to the lay rectors was made because the church was unaware of the law			1
a church council spokesman said : ' we knew it was potentially going to upset some people			0
we did n't want to alienate those who support us but , at the same time , we had to follow instructions from the diocese in our duty to the church			2
' there are currently 15,000 parish churches across @entity197 and @entity198 , with 5,200 of them potentially having nearby residents responsible for funding repairs of the chancel of the church			1
currently , the government advises new land purchasers to carry out checks as to whether they would be held responsible for repair costs			0
from next month , chancel repair liability will only bind buyers of registered land if it is referred to on the land register .			2

some residents in @entity9 , @entity21 , have just been informed by their local church *authority* they are liable for the chancel upkeep costs
@entity217 have had 10 years to register properties liable for upkeep costs or lose out on making claims
the deadline for registering liable properties is oct 13 2013 - so @entity14 in @entity9 has just got in within the deadline
residents are outraged they have no time to do anything about it
