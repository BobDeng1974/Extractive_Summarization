by @entity0 taking a stand : @entity2 , a former pediatric critical care nurse , has made it her mission to get surrogacy federally outlawed a woman has made it her mission to get surrogacy - the carrying of a pregnancy by a third party for intended parents - federally outlawed in the @entity14 @entity2 , who has 25 years ' experience as a pediatric critical care nurse , told @entity17 that separating a child from its birth mother is morally reprehensible because it creates a ' primal wound '			1
' it always strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions , ' said the 56 - year - old , who has written in the past about why surrogacy and @entity29 are not @entity31 concepts			1
' it 's all about adults - who wants , who needs , who buys and what i can get			2
' in her new documentary , @entity38 : a sub-class of @entity40 , she cites several examples of surrogacy gone wrong , arguing that these are proof that the practice has flaws and that its legality should be reevaluated			1
one example used by ms @entity2 , who has three college - age daughters of her own , is a woman from @entity49 who carried a child for a same - sex couple and then fought for visitation rights when the baby was born			1
in the film , the woman reveals that when the girl was older , she asked her : ' why did you give me away , when we look alike , but you kept the other children ? ' another woman says in a trailer for the documentary : ' it 's not just her uterus that she 's renting , it 's her entire body			2
' ms @entity2 , who is president of the @entity65 in @entity66 , also asserts that the practice of surrogacy unfairly benefits the wealthy who can afford it , while exploiting those of lesser means			1
indeed , the entire process including in vitro fertilization , donor eggs , legal fees and compensation for the surrogate can cost upwards of $ 100,000 , according to @entity80 , the executive director of @entity81 : the @entity82			0
' it 's obviously expensive technology and people with financial means want what they want , ' said ms @entity2			2
of course , not all surrogacy experiences have had negative outcomes			2
@entity90 , 38 , said having twins via a gestational surrogate , her college roommate , was ' the culmination of technology and love			0
' after a strep infection made her unable to carry children on her own , a doctor told ms @entity90 that surrogacy was her best bet , even though it cost a total of $ 40,000			2
criticism : ms @entity2 claims that surrogacy does not take into consideration the moral implications for the child , and that it unfairly benefits the wealthy while exploiting the poor but for parents desperate to have a child , the process is undoubtedly worth every penny			1
' everyone along the journey was great , ' said the proud mom			0
' you need to see a picture of my daughters to see the happiness that this has brought to our lives			0
' still , the monetary factor does remain an ethical debate , with different states enforcing different rules			0
in @entity130 , contracted surrogacy is allowed for domestic partnerships			0
@entity135 , on the other hand , where same - sex marriage is banned , only allows married couples to have surrogacy agreements			1
' it always strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions , it 's all about adults ' in @entity144 and @entity145 , surrogacy is legal , so long as the surrogate is not paid			0
and legislation in @entity148 also bans surrogacy compensation			0
but according to ms @entity80 , banning surrogacy is a backwards step for society			0
' medical advances now allow people to see who were blind ; people to walk who lost legs ; and people to live lives that a few years ago no one thought was possible , ' she said			0
' we have the medical technology to allow people to become parents , and why should we simply ban it ? ' ms @entity2 has also voiced her criticism of other assisted reproductive technologies including egg donation , sperm donation and @entity29			1
' @entity168 still need to look more carefully at today 's reproductive technologies such as @entity29 in light of our beliefs about @entity172 , life , our bodies , and our children , ' she wrote in a 2013 @entity177 piece			1

@entity2 is a 56 - year - old activist against assisted reproductive technologies , who has expressed her belief that surrogacy *conflicts* with @entity31 morals
she has just *released* a new documentary called @entity38 : a sub-class of women about why surrogacy should be banned
