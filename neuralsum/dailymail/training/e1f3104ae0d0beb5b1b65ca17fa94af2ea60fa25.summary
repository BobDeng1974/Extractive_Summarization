sudden : @entity0 passed away while she was studying to be a nurse after taking out a $ 100,000 student loan a @entity4 pastor is being mercilessly hounded for $ 200,000 in student loans he was saddled with when his 27 - year - old daughter @entity6 died suddenly of liver failure			1
crippled by the $ 2,000 a month in repayments and unable legally to declare bankruptcy to rid himself of the huge debt , @entity12 , 59 , and his wife @entity13 have reached their wits end			1
each time they have appealed to the lenders to beg for help , the couple have been told that the only solution is to repay the mammoth loans - some of which have interest rates of 12 percent - in full			0
making the situation dramatically worse is the fact that the couple are now the guardians of daughter @entity6 's three children , ages nine , 12 and 14 , leaving their futures in the balance			1
before her death , @entity0 had taken out $ 100,000 in private student loans to fund her education at nursing school and crucially , @entity12 had co-signed on them			1
in the five years since her tragic passing , @entity12 and @entity13 's inability to keep up with the payments has seen the sum owed double to $ 200,000 because of the high interest rates and late - fee penalties			1
compounding the desperation , @entity12 makes less than $ 75,000 a year at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity4 and @entity13 earns less in her role as director at the same church			1
guardians : @entity12 and wife @entity13 with their grandchildren , ages , nine , 12 and 14 - who they are caring for ' it 's just impossible on a pastor 's salary raising three kids to pay $ 2,000 a month on loans , ' said @entity12 to @entity59 , claiming that he is now searching for a second job			1
the answer to why @entity12 is in such dire financial straits is because these are private student loans			1
had they been federal student loans , then @entity12 could have appealed to have them wiped or at the very least received a sensible and manageable payment plan			2
however , because these are private loans he has nowhere to turn legally			0
private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty , according to @entity59 , not even when a family member has passed away			0
to ' forgive ' a loan is purely down to the lending firm and @entity12 told @entity59 that he has called each of the lenders who provided his daughter money and asked for help and they have said that while they understand , they are not legally required to help			1
even worse , student loans are the only type of debt that can not be discharged by declaring bankruptcy			0
' people with other debt from splurging -- they can discharge that , ' he said to @entity59			0
' student loans should really be the one type of debt they do discharge because it 's done to further an education and career			0
but somehow getting my daughter an education has encumbered me for the rest of my life			0
' @entity99 and daughter : @entity0 with her mother , @entity13 , before her tragic and sudden death from liver failure in 2009 one of the lenders , @entity105 , did reduce @entity12 's interest rate to 0 % on three of four loans and lowered the amount owed from $ 35,000 to $ 27,000			1
' we extend our deepest sympathies to the @entity12 family on the loss of their daughter , ' the company said in a statement to @entity59			2
' we 're reaching out to mr. @entity12 to offer further assistance as appropriate			0
' another of the lenders , @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , who provided the bulk of the loan to @entity6 , said that it is merely recouping its money and does n't make the law on loan forgiveness			2
@entity12 was told by @entity118 that he would need to speak to the original lender , @entity126			0
the pastor did and was told that he had to repay the loans			0
@entity12 has shelved his plans for retirement and because he is bringing up his daughter 's children will be looking after them till his 70th birthday , minimum			2
he has not taken a vacation with his wife since @entity6 's death and feels financially trapped			2
' we 've pretty much gone through our retirement [ funds ] already -- we did n't have a lot saved to begin with and now any extra money goes to the kids , as it should , and then whatever we can pay on the loans , we do , ' said @entity12 to @entity59			2
' at my stage of life , i should have a very different lifestyle than i do			0
