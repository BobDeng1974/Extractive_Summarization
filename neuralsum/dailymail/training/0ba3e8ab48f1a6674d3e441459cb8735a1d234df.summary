saroo before he went missing : in a new book he tells the story of how he got lost a thousand miles from home , then found his way back 25 years later an @entity6 man who was lost riding the train aged four then adopted by parents and moved to @entity9 , only to be reunited with his birth mother 25 years later , has retold his incredible story in a new book			1
@entity14 from @entity15 , @entity9 , was just another poor boy growing up in rural @entity6 , until he accidentally leapt aboard a train that took him a thousand miles away to a strange city			1
alone , unable to speak the language , and with no knowledge of where he 'd come from , he had to beg to survive until he was rescued by an orphanage and adopted by an @entity9 family			1
from then on , he grew up an @entity9 and enjoyed success in his adoptive country			2
but he was unable - and unwilling - to forget the land of his childhood			0
determined to rediscover his past he embarked on a virtual odyssey of his homeland and , after many hours poring over @entity30 , he managed recognise his home town - and track down his mother			2
their reunion in 2012 made headlines across the world , but now he has told his full story in a new book , @entity38 , published this week			1
like many children growing up in rural @entity6 , @entity14 rarely had enough to eat and would often travel on trains to beg for scraps with his older brother			1
but during one ill - fated trip he stopped for a doze at the station with his brother and when he woke up he found that he was alone			2
' i opened my eyes and could n't see my brother , but i saw a train in front of me with the door open and for some reason i thought he was on board , ' he said			2
' i ran over and jumped on the train just as the doors closed and pulled out of the station , and it was only then that i realised he was n't there			2
i think you could say that split - second decision changed my life forever			0
' not finding his brother aboard the train , @entity14 simply stayed on the train as it made its 1,000 mile journey across the country from @entity68 , @entity69 , to @entity70 ( now @entity70 )			1
he has previously told how he spent a month trying to find his way back , almost drowning in the @entity72 and nearly being abducted by a man who intended to sell him as a slave			2
finally , @entity14 was rescued from the city streets and put into a juvenile home			1
unable to tell carers even where he 'd come from , he was transferred to an orphanage , where he was adopted by an @entity9 couple			1
he ended up moving to @entity81 where he started a new life with a loving family			0
he eventually earned a bachelor 's degree in business management and joined his adoptive family 's engineering firm			0
but he never gave up hope that he might one day get back to his roots , but with no idea what it was called it seemed an impossible dream			0
' i kept in my head the images of the town i grew up in , the streets i used to wander and the faces of my family , i treasured those memories , ' he told the @entity81 @entity101			0
emotional : @entity14 's reunion with his mother , 25 years after he got lost riding the train with his older brother determined , he spent years looking at maps for signs of the landmarks that he knew as a child and eventually he turned to @entity30			1
@entity14 remembered travelling for around 14 hours in the train to @entity70			1
estimating the speed of the train to be about 50mph , he calculated that his hometown could be around 1,000 miles from @entity70			1
@entity14 then drew a circle on a map with @entity70 at the centre			1
in an interview with @entity118 , @entity14 described how he singled out his town			2
he said : ' i thought to myself , " well , the first thing you 're gon na see before you come to your home town is the river where you used to play with your brothers , and the waterfall , and the architecture of this particular place where you used to visit quite a lot			0
" it has to be exactly the same , otherwise , if it 's not , i 'd just fly over and go somewhere else			0
' ' when i found it , i zoomed on it and bang , it just came up			0
i navigated it all the way from the waterfall where i used to play , ' @entity14 told the @entity138			2
magic moment : mr @entity14 pictured with his mother , @entity140 , when they met for the first time in 25 years but even after he spotted what he believed to be the town where he had spent his earliest years , it took months for @entity14 to organise a trip to test out his theory			1
and when he finally did reach his old home in the town of @entity151 , it was empty			0
mr @entity14 's book , @entity38 , was published this week by @entity153 ' i just thought the worst , i thought perhaps everyone 's gone , my whole family 's died , they 've passed away , ' he told @entity118			1
it was then that he had another stroke of luck , as locals began to approach him and ask him his business			0
he told them his names , and the names of his mother and siblings , and he soon found someone who was able to help			0
@entity14 went on : ' by the time the fourth person had come , they said , " just stay here for a sec , " and within 10 minutes they came back around and they said , " now i 'm going to take you to your mother			1
" ' he followed the person just a few yards around a corner , to where three ladies stood at the entrance to a house			0
one of them was his mother , @entity184			0
' i looked at the second one and i thought , ' there 's something about you ' - and it took me a few seconds but i decrypted what she used to looked like , ' he said			0
' she looked so much shorter than i remembered when i was a four - year - old child			0
' but she walked forward , and i walked forward , and my emotions and tears and the chemical in my brain , you know , it was like a nuclear fusion			0
' mr @entity14 's book , @entity38 , was published this week by @entity153 .			1
