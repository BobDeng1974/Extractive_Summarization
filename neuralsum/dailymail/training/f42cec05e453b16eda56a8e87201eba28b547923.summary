as the man who claimed the first @entity3 men 's singles title for 77 years at @entity4 , you 'd think @entity5 had won enough honours this year			0
but the tennis ace triumphed over another net altogether : beating football , computer games and the royal baby to become 2013 's most - discussed event on @entity13			1
@entity5 mania clocked in at number one in @entity3 , followed by @entity17 's death at number two and the @entity20 final at number three			1
national pride : @entity5 's win was the high point of a hot summer - and users took to @entity13 to say so @entity17 's death and funeral in @entity29 , pictured , clocked in at number two , though not all comment was complimentary			1
while some praised the @entity35 's legacy online , others attacked it sport : perhaps surprisingly considering both teams were @entity40 , the @entity20 final at @entity38 beat the birth of @entity42 to third place			1
pictured : @entity44 fouls @entity45 the list sheds an interesting light on the topics that dominate @entity3 life , with some unexpected results			2
two of the top ten were blockbuster computer games , call of duty : ghosts and @entity56 , while live politics featured only once , with the introduction of the so - called ' bedroom tax '			1
sport meanwhile dominated the list , taking four of the top ten spots including sir @entity64 's retirement from @entity65 and @entity67 's success in cricket at the @entity69			1
television featured only once , with @entity71 clocking in at number eight			2
all the events could soon be challenged by the death of @entity75 on thursday , which drew interactions by more than 55 million people in the first day after it was announced			2
baby mania : the birth of @entity42 ranked higher globally , at number three , than it did in @entity3 national pastime : @entity60 dominated the top ten , with sir @entity64 's retirement at number five perhaps understandably with about 1.2 billion @entity89 in the world , the election of @entity88 was the top event globally , followed by ' election ' - referring to many different countries - ' royal baby '			1
curiously enough , the news of @entity42 of @entity96 coming into the world ranked higher globally , at number three , than it did in @entity3 , at number four			0
the social network also released lists of the places where people ' check in ' the most			2
unsurprisingly , the top ten in @entity3 was dominated by big sporting and music venues including the @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity38 , the @entity111 shopping centres and the theme parks @entity113 and @entity114			1
but it was the most fundamental part of human nature which won the day			0
the most - added ' life event ' to users ' timelines was a new relationship , engagement or marriage , a @entity13 spokesman said			1
global power : the sheer number of @entity89 in the world helped put pope @entity88 ' election at number one scale : with its 20,000 seats , it 's no surprise that @entity109 's @entity133 arena was the most checked - in location most discussed topics 1			2
