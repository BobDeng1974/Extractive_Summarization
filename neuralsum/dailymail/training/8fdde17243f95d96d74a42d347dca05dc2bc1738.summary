by @entity0 published : 07:30 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 23 may 2013 it is the camera used to photograph the @entity4 from an orbiting space station 40 years before commander @entity6 captured the world 's attention with his pictures from the @entity10			1
a rare @entity12 camera used aboard @entity13 , the first @entity15 @entity14 , which orbited the @entity4 from 1973 to 1979 , is set to be auctioned			1
the modified @entity17 500 el / @entity16 was specially adapted to work in the cramped conditions about @entity13 - and be operated while wearing spacesuits			1
the modified @entity17 500 el / @entity16 was taken to the moon during the @entity22 and @entity23 missions in 1973 the rare ' moon ' camera was used aboard @entity13 , the first @entity15 space station in 1972 , shown here in a picture taken by astronauts in 1979 as they left the station for the last time @entity13 was the @entity15 ' first space station , and orbited the @entity4 from 1973 to 1979 in various forms			1
it included a workshop , a solar observatory , and other systems			0
three manned missions to the station , conducted between 1973 and 1974 each delivered a three - astronaut crew			1
on the last two manned missions , an additional @entity40 / @entity39 stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed			1
the space agency worked with @entity17 to develop the cameras , known as ' moon cameras ' , even thought this particular one did not make it to the lunar surface			0
the @entity17 cameras were selected by @entity12 because of their interchangeable lenses and magazines			2
modifications were made to permit ease of use in cramped conditions while wearing spacesuits , such as the replacement of the reflex mirror with an eye - level finder			2
in this model along with other modifications the mirror was removed to reduce weight			0
a special large locking mechanism was also added in order to change film magazines with bulky space gloves on			2
the modified @entity17 500 el / @entity16 was developed with @entity12 so it could be used on the lunar surface - although this model never made it that far the cameras were specially modified with a larger lock ( left ) so astronauts could easily change the film while wearing bulky gloves on the lunar surface similarly a larger , sturdier shutter release plate was added to the camera and the special reseau plate with matching body number ' 42 ' to imprint on taken images			1
the camera - which is expected to fetch 50 to 60,000 euros - is set to go under the hammer in @entity83 , @entity84 , on saturday			2
some of the @entity86 images are included ion the auction , showing exactly what it was used for the same camera model was also taken to the moon - and twelve @entity92 still remain on the lunar surface			0
they were left there to allow for the 25kg of lunar rock samples that were brought back instead			0
the same camera model was also taken to the moon - and twelve @entity92 still remain on the lunar surface			0
they were left there to allow for the 25kg of lunar rock samples that were brought back instead			0
only the film magazines were brought back to @entity4			0
special tabs were added to the lens so astronauts could operate them wearing gloves @entity12 also replaced the reflex mirror with an eye - level finder to make it easier to use in cramped conditions			1

camera was taken into orbit during the @entity12 's @entity115 and @entity23 missions in 1973
specially adapted camera could take pictures in cramped condition , and film could be changed while wearing a spacesuit
