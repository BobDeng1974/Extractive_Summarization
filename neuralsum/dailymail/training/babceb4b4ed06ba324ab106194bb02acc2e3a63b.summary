by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 17 june 2013 these intricate creations look like a church 's stained glass windows - but are actually layers and layers of carefully cut paper			1
the laser - cut sculptures are the work of artist @entity10 , 45 , who stumbled across the idea by accident			1
' i took out my sketchbook straight away and wrote down a dozen questions that took about two years to work through , to enable me to come up with the finished idea			0
' each piece takes about 80 hours of laser - cutting time , using 100 layers of coloured paper on average			1
the sheets of cut paper are assembled by hand then bound to reveal the finished work			1
one piece of artwork takes @entity10 up to four months to complete			1
his largest work so far is called @entity30 and made of 134 layers of paper			2
looking into the sculptures reveals the scale of the stack of paper and the colours within the works are finished by being bound into a flipbook			1
the orange cover frames the details in the centre of the books professor @entity10 's foray into working with paper was accidental , he says each designs takes between three to four months of work to become a finished piece ' i 'm like a monk with a laser , ' @entity10 told @entity75			1
' i give it everything - it 's not just pushing a button			2
you 've got to have faith in what you do - you ca n't fake faith			2
' the projects are meticulously planned before the laser comes out			0
he said : ' i sketch a composition first , working out an overall goal			0
' then i draw each layer in vector - based software			0
each layer is cut individually with a @entity91			0
@entity10 's projects are inspired by @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity96 art motifs this one looks like a window to the sea made of delicate loops of paper @entity10 began working with lasers on his own paintings before trying the technique on card and then paper up to 80 hours is spent on the cutting of the paper alone ' the work is then cleaned of chads [ leftover bits of paper ] , assembled and bound like a flip book			1
' the final stage of my process includes building a mount and frame that holds the work , allowing for a degree of movement that is inherent with paper			0
' professor @entity10 took inspiration by @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity96 art motifs , first copying their geometry before ' riffing ' his own ideas			2
different angles reveal more detail in each piece thanks to the way they are stacked the plan for each design is sketched out by hand then drawn in vector - based software the 3d pieces are often symmetrical to mimic ancient art motifs the creations mimic the symmetry of his influences and reveal colours and shapes when explored from different angles			1
he said : ' i 've been fortunate in the work 's reception			0
someone described my work as " otherworldly "			0
that rang positively with me			0
' truly this work could not be done without the use of technology , although whatever the reason , i 'm lucky enough to have the patience to do what i do			0
