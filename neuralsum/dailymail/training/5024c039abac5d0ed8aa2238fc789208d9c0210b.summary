by @entity0 for @entity1 these pictures show a group of rare ospreys who waste no time catching a fishy dinner before they fly south for the winter			2
the two young birds were being taught to fish by their parents at a small loch in @entity12 in the @entity13			1
they were captured as they took it in turns to dive into the water with their wings back before snaring a rainbow trout from under the surface with their sharp claws			0
this group of rare ospreys were photographed as they took just seconds to snare a fish for dinner at a small loch in the @entity13 before flying south for winter two younger birds were being taught by their parents how to dive and swoop for their meal - and they were lucky enough to catch a rainbow trout with their sharp claws wildlife enthusiast @entity31 , 59 , from @entity33 in @entity34 , was lucky to capture the scenes on camera			1
he said : ‘ i spent three mornings in a hide near the loch and the ospreys were amazing to watch as they swooped into the water from a really high height			1
‘ the birds are feeding up to maintain their weight for migration			2
i was lucky as i had a great view of feeding time from my hide			0
‘ it ’s not the easiest photography , when an osprey dives for a fish the whole dive lasts just a few seconds and a steady hand and even steadier nerves are required to get the images of the birds fishing			2
’ @entity57 are busy feeding up on fish – the only food they consume - before beginning their long migration to @entity63 for the winter			1
hovering over the water in search of fish , adults are successful around one in four dives , whilst juveniles take longer to catch their prey			0
