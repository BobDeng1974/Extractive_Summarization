another says : ' taking the @entity13 , mp3 ... ' , then adds : ' there 's the phone '			1
his accomplice asks : ' what phone is it ? ' and is told it is a @entity56 ' @entity55 '			2
the burglars move on to another part of the house and one picks up an item of clothing , saying : ' pair of @entity12 's , man '			2
later , one of the gang says : ' i want to go upstairs , there 'll be more upstairs			0
' one burglar is filmed checking with his friend : ' you got the phone , ai n't you ? ' while another revels in his pickings , saying : ' ... got the dough for tomorrow anyway '			2
the hooded burglars are showing helping themselves to a mobile telephone they find laid as bait the burglars ' greed is plain to see as they make their way around the ' capture house ' in north @entity23 one of the thieves instantly identifies the phone as a @entity55 , a highly - covetable android mobile @entity86 police were alerted to the burglary in process via motion sensors in the bugged house , and swooped on the property while the youths were still ransacking it			1

' the police were lent an empty house by the local council , and filled it with discreetly hidden @entity125 cameras , before strewing around various tempting goods including an android mobile telephone , @entity13 , mp3 music player and designer clothes			1
the hidden police cameras , pixellated here by officers , gave detectives crystal - clear shots of the thieves ' faces the burglars were all subsequently charged and found guilty of burglary , and received suspended sentences going upstairs for more : @entity86 police had filled the house with hidden cameras the cameras in the house were motion sensitive , and once movement was recorded by thieves breaking into the house , officers were alerted by text			1

@entity97 said the cameras were just one of the high - tech tools police were using to clamp down on burglars			1
he said : ' we also use forensics marking spray on door handles , window frames , sills and property which has a ‘ bar code ’ unique to that can – so anyone found with that marking liquid on them ca n’t deny having been inside the house			0
inspector @entity97 , of @entity177 , said burglaries dropped dramatically after their sting operation police officers could watch the burglary live in process on their mobile phones thanks to the hidden cameras ' our capture houses have proved very effective both in catching and helping convict offenders , plus deterring burglars … we want thieves to know they could easily pick the ‘ wrong ’ house and fall straight into police hands			1
