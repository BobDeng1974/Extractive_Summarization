by @entity0 a powerful horse tranquilliser that doubles as a dangerous and illegal party drug was so successful as a treatment for depression that it helped a 32 - year - old woman leave the house by herself of the first time in over a decade			1
the woman , who chose to remain anonymous , was part of a controversial study by the @entity10 in which 28 severely depressed patients were regularly injected with ketamine - a powerful and hallucinogenic party drug that ’s usually snorted by its users - in an effort to improve their lives			1
patients injected with the veterinary tranquilliser said the treatments left them feeling ‘ peculiar ’ , saying the injections made ‘ things sound and look different ’ and left them with ‘ a distorted sense of time ’			1
@entity24 turned party drug ketamine helped a severely depressed woman ( not pictured in this file photo ) leave her house alone for the first time in 10 years a controversial @entity31 study has found regular injections of the party drug may help treat severe depression the mother of one patient said the injections left her daughter - who 'd suffered from crippling depression for most of her adult life , leaving her unable to leave the house by herself - feeling ' chatty ' and able to ' concentrate better '			1
' after she ’s had the treatment , she ’s already feeling better before we leave the hospital , ' she told the @entity46 's @entity45			2
' it works that quickly , and she ’s sort of got a lot more confidence in herself when she ’s had the treatment			0
' @entity51 ( left ) says the drug ketamine ( right ) can improve the lives of those with chronic depression her mum said one treatment was so successful that her daughter went for a walk outside the house by herself for the first time in over a decade			1
' she ’s chatty and she ’ll talk to people			0
she ’s not as withdrawn as she ’d normally be , ' she said			0
' she can concentrate better , and after one lot of the treatment she even went out for a walk on her own the day after - which she ’s not done ... in the last 10 years			0
' ketamine : a powerful horse tranquilliser once used to anaesthetise humans but was largely abandoned due the hallucinations it causes			1
the illegal party drug is now being used as a treatment for depression			1
ecstasy : the drug , which produces hallucinations and euphoric feelings , is already being trialled as a treatment for @entity80 but could also be used by cancer patients			2
magic mushrooms : these naturally occurring hallucinogens could be used in psychotherapy to treat obsessive compulsive disorders or depression			0
cocaine : the leaves of the plant that form the base for the party drug has long been used in its raw form as a topical anaesthetic and numbing agent for injuries or operations among @entity99 tribes			2
the @entity102 - funded study 's head researcher , @entity51 , said patients were given either three or six ketamine injection over three weeks			1
of the study ’s 28 participants , 29 per cent reported a positive benefit that lasted between four and seven days , while 15 per cent reported feeling better for at least a month			1
he said that for some patients , the effects lasted for up to nine months			2
mr @entity51 said the challenge now is to find a way to regulate and extend the effects of the drug			0
‘ that ’s the thing that will be interesting in the future , how could we extend the benefit , ’ he said			0
‘ during the 40 minute infusion of people having a low dose of this they feel pretty peculiar and things sound and look different and they have a distorted sense of time			1
‘ occasionally people feel anxious during the infusion , and we also had one person who had a nasty faint as well			2
but those kinds of side effects stop pretty much as soon as the infusion stops			0
‘ ( the effects ) are very variable , some people it may only be six hours but for others – we had one patient who seemed to get a benefit that lasted nine months			0
in the majority though it ’s about two weeks			0
' it looks as if ( the drug ) is safe enough when used in a controlled setting			0
' research into ketamine as a treatment for depression was launched in @entity147 over a decade ago , after doctors found that the party drug blocked receptors in the same part of the brain thought to be responsible for depression			1
the results have proven so successful that private clinics - like @entity157 's @entity156 , which provides patients tv and @entity159 while undergoing the hour - long procedure - charge us $ 525 ( £ 315 ) per injection			2
the company 's website warns patients might experience ' minor visual hallucinations ' while undergoing the treatment .			0
