a baby who developed a life - threatening heart defect in the womb has had a heart transplant - at just 23 days old			1
doctors said little @entity5 ' could die at any moment ' after being born with just half a heart in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the right side of the organ , which is essential to provide blood to the lungs , had not formed and the only hope of survival was a transplant			1
miracle baby : @entity5 spent just two days on the transplant list before a new heart was found for him with the average wait for an infant heart being six months , @entity5 's chances looked slim so his family were amazed to get the call after after just two days on the transplant list			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , who was 22 weeks pregnant when she learned of his condition , said she spent the rest of the pregnancy in fear			0
' i never bought him clothes			0
i was just scared , ' she said			0
but now she challenges anyone to see that there was ever anything wrong with him			0
if you did n't know , you would n't know anything was wrong , ' doing well : @entity5 gets a cuddle from mother @entity27 , after undergoing the successful transplant at just 23 days old doctors had initially thought that his heart could be repaired with a series of corrective surgeries in the first few years of his life			1
at just 23 days old , @entity5 is @entity51 's youngest heart recipient in 25 years			1
pediatric heart surgeon , @entity53 , said they were worried he would not live long enough for surgery			0
he said of the heart : ' it had such severe disease that we were afraid that the baby could arrest or die at any moment			0
' infants usually have to wait an average six months for an organ to become available on the list so @entity5 was lucky he only had to wait two days after being listed			1
a six - day - old premature baby became the youngest infant to receive a heart transplant at a @entity69 hospital in january			1
@entity70 underwent the operation at @entity72 in @entity73 after being born seven weeks ahead of schedule with a heart defect which meant her parents did n't expect him to survive			2
but when he was born in early february at an @entity8 hospital , they discovered he had only one coronary artery instead of two and determined that surgery would be too risky			2
he was airlifted to @entity83 when he was five days old where doctors confirmed that the only hope for his survival was an urgent heart transplant			1
incredibly , within two days of being on the list , a donor was found and the operation was able to go ahead			2
the operation made @entity5 the second youngest heart recipient at the hospital , only surpassed by a 16 - day - old tot who received a transplanted heart in 1994			1
dr. @entity96 , professor of pediatric cardiology and director of the @entity98 at @entity51 , said @entity5 's case was ' special '			0
' any surgery that potentially could have been done aside from transplant was exceedingly high - risk , so the decision was made that we would list for heart transplantation , ' he said			2
' all of our heart transplant patients are special , but i think this one was special because we knew there was a risk we might not find a donor in time			2
' at five weeks old , he was well enough to go home yesterday and join his two older brothers			0
@entity5 is expected to remain on medication and will need follow - up care			0
doctors expect that his new heart should last up to 20 years before he 'll need another transplant .			0

@entity5 spent just two days on the transplant list
born with *pulmonary* *atresia* meaning only one side of heart formed
doctors said he could die ' any day ' unless he got donor organ
he has been allowed home to @entity8 at 5 - weeks old
