by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:23 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 09:12 est , 1 may 2013 a team of government experts which tries to ‘ nudge ’ the public into changing their behaviour without them noticing is to be turned into a profit - making business			1
the @entity8 will be spun out of @entity9 to become a @entity10 - style mutual , making money for employees , a private firm and the government			1
but fears were raised of a conflict of interest at the heart of government , with the new firm advising ministers while also bidding for contracts from companies who want to influence laws			1
end of the road : the move to transfer civil servants into private companies will signal the end of the traditional view of the @entity9 mandarin the unit uses a mix of psychology , advertising tricks and commons sense to coax people into losing weight , paying court fines and having their lofts insulated			1
the move means the @entity44 taxpayer could benefit from lucrative contracts advising other governments , companies and charities			2
but it raises the prospect of it advising ministers on public policy while being employed by private firms who want different things			1
@entity57 , @entity58 's shadow cabinet office minister , said : ' they are going to start bidding for non-government work			1
immediately here is a question to be asked about a conflict of interest			2
' what happens if they are nudging people into stopping smoking and then start bidding for work from people in the tobacco industry or pharmaceuticals			2
' there are major issues about policy advice being done like this			0
i can not see how they will be resolved			0
policy advice should be neutral and disinterested			0
' the move could also pave the way for thousands of civil servants to be shifted into the private sector in the past , governments have privatised state - run services like @entity85 but today ’s announcement marks the first time a group of policy experts have been hived off to become a company			1
the unit , run by former @entity58 adviser @entity92 , uses random tests and trials to see how small changes in policy can influence behaviour the so - called @entity8 of around 10 civil servants was created in 2010 to find ways to save money and persuade the public to be healthier , greener and more law - abiding			1
dismissed by some as a ' nutty indulgence ' , it claims to have raised millions of pounds by coaxing more people into paying tax and court fines on time			2
for example , when personalised texts were sent to people who owed court fines , payments rose by a third			2
the @entity8 is separate from the @entity115 which has attracted criticism this week after @entity117 appointed a string of old school friends to his political inner circle			0
the prime minister announced that @entity122 , the @entity123 brother of @entity125 mayor @entity124 , is to head the policy unit			2
mr @entity122 will be joined by @entity127 , former @entity128 editor of @entity130 magazine and a personal friend of the pm			0
the @entity8 has been dismissed as a ' nutty indulgence ' by some in government , but since its creation in 2010 it claims to have saved millions of pounds by using psychology to persuade people to pay fines , look for work or save energy			1
ideas backed or highlighted by the @entity143 include : the nudge unit is staffed by civil servants , lead by psychologist @entity92 , who ran the @entity58 government ’s strategy team			1
it currently costs £ 520,000 - a - year to run , but ministers claim it has come up with ideas which have saved the taxpayer millions of pounds			0
it was set up in 2010 for two years			0
under the plan , a private company will be sought to provide investment into the new company			2
the government will retain a stake and the staff of around 10 civil servants will become shareholders in the same way that employees at @entity10 receive bonuses based on company profits while they work there			1
it is expected that the staff will retain a share of at least a quarter in the company as a blocking minority stake , able to decide how the firm is run			1
a competition will be announced today to find a business partner for the nudge unit			2
the idea is being pushed by cabinet office minister @entity177 , who wants to massively increase the productivity of the public sector by giving staff a financial incentive			1
mr @entity177 said : ' we are in a global race for the jobs and opportunities of the future			0
' to get @entity44 back on the rise we must find innovative models like mutuals and joint ventures , which can deliver services better and more efficiently , while supporting growth in the economy			0
' the @entity8 is world - renowned and under a joint venture business model we will combine the benefits of private sector experience and investment with the innovation and commitment from staff leadership to develop a sustainable growth business			1
' public sector productivity flat - lined from 1997 to 2010 , he added			1
but unions said there was little appetite among civil servants to become mutuals			0
@entity211 general secretary @entity210 said : ' there is nothing mutual , co-operative or employee - led about what cabinet office minister @entity177 is trying to do			0
' the first mutual in the civil service was imposed by @entity216 against a backdrop of strikes by the staff who wanted to remain as civil servants			0
' improving public services requires investment , not gimmicks and back - door privatisation			0
' but @entity225 , @entity226 , said : turning the @entity8 into a profit - making enterprise through a joint venture partnership is an innovative way of commercialising @entity9 expertise			0
' this will give the new enterprise the freedom to drive greater efficiency and to compete for new business , generating savings and potential new revenue for the government			0
' new delivery models , such as mutual joint ventures , offer real potential to transform public services by combining private sector knowledge and investment with employee ownership and leadership			1
the @entity226 believes there are many other functions across central and local government that could benefit from similar partnership models			0
