conclusions : sir @entity1 , a former @entity3 clerk , has said that more needs to be done to ensure @entity6 @entity5 have more control over @entity6 - only policies laws that affect @entity6 alone should no longer be passed in the @entity3 without the consent of a majority of @entity5 , an inquiry has concluded			2
the changes are designed to end the problem of unpopular measures affecting @entity6 , but not @entity16 , being approved only with the support of @entity16 mps			2
in 2004 , for example , @entity19 pushed through tuition fees for @entity6 even though most @entity6 mps voted against the policy			1
it passed only because @entity25 packed the lobbies in favour of the move – despite the fact tuition fees would not apply north of the border because the devolved executive there had rejected the plan			0
an independent commission , led by former @entity3 clerk sir @entity1 , has said more needs to be done to ensure @entity6 @entity5 have better control			1
the report was commissioned by the @entity37 last year , and ministers will now consider whether to implement its conclusions			0
it calls for a compromise ‘ double - lock ’ system , under which laws that apply in @entity6 alone are approved first by @entity5 before they go to a vote before the whole commons , which comprises mps of all four nations of the @entity48			1
the report suggests any @entity6 - only laws should first be considered by a committee made up of mps representing @entity6 constituencies			1
laws would not go forward unless they achieved the support of this committee , whose make - up should reflect the balance of parties in @entity6			2
the legislation would then be voted on by all mps in the @entity3 – be they @entity6 , @entity63 , @entity16 or @entity64			2
this is to ensure that mps from other countries are not relegated to ‘ second class ’ status			0
greater @entity6 voice : sir @entity1 's commission suggests laws that apply in @entity6 alone are approved first by @entity5 before they go to a vote before the whole @entity3 so , in effect , every law would have to be supported by both a representative majority of @entity6 mps and a majority of all of @entity48 ’s @entity5			1
the new regime is designed to solve the so - called ‘ @entity91 ’ question , which asks why it is that @entity16 , @entity63 or @entity64 mps have the same right to vote at @entity85 as any @entity6 mp now that large areas of policy are devolved to national parliaments and assemblies			1
many conservatives have called for purely ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’ , with mps from other nations barred from voting on such issues			1
but @entity98 says to do that would undermine the @entity100			2
the party is also concerned that , because it often relies on @entity16 mps for a majority at @entity85 , @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws could make governing impossible			1
tuition fees : @entity19 pushed the policy through for @entity6 even though most @entity6 @entity5 voted against the policy , by using @entity25 to back him in the vote now sir @entity1 ’s commission has unveiled a compromise which maintains the integrity of the @entity48 but provides a greater @entity6 voice			0
he said : ‘ surveys have shown that people in @entity6 are unhappy about the existing arrangements , and support change			0
there is a feeling that @entity6 is at a disadvantage , and that it ’s not right that mps representing the devolved nations should be able to vote on matters affecting @entity6			0
‘ the status quo clearly can not be sustained			0
our proposals retain the right of a @entity48 - wide majority to make the final decisions where they believe @entity48 interests or those of a part of the @entity48 other than @entity6 should prevail			0
’ a @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ we will give the report very serious consideration before we respond			0

independent commission suggests @entity6 mps to have extra committees
many conservatives have called for ‘ @entity6 votes for @entity6 laws ’
@entity98 says to do that would undermine the @entity100
