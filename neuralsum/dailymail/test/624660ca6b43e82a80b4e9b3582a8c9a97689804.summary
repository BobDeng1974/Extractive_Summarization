@entity3 - @entity1 rock band @entity2 , who say they chose their name as a way to reclaim a term usually considered a racial slur , can not trademark the name because it is disparaging , a @entity1 appeals court ruled on monday			1
the decision by the @entity12 rejected the band 's argument that the government 's refusal to grant a trademark violated its free speech rights			1
the ruling could have implications for the high - profile fight over whether the @entity23 's @entity22 should lose its trademarks			1
the @entity25 , who say they chose their name as a way to reclaim a term usually considered a racial slur , can not trademark the name because it is disparaging , a @entity1 appeals court has ruled the @entity34 , @entity35 - based band , which plays a kind of grunge music it calls @entity38 , applied for trademarks in 2010 and 2011 , and was rejected both times on the grounds the name disparaged @entity42			1

the @entity1 @entity77 has said that even though some speech may be offensive , that ' does not justify its suppression , ' she said			0
the case has parallels to the @entity22 ' lawsuit against five @entity83 who successfully convinced the pto in june to cancel the @entity23 team 's trademarks because that name disparages @entity83			2
the team is appealing the cancellation , saying the disparagement provision violates the @entity51			0
