@entity1 boss @entity0 masterminded his first victory over former club @entity3 as a 2 - 1 @entity5 win fired the @entity6 back into the @entity8 title race			1
@entity3 were going for nine league wins in a row but goals from @entity12 and @entity13 moved @entity1 up to second , just four points behind the leaders			1
@entity17 had a goal wrongly disallowed for the visitors late on before fellow substitute @entity20 pulled one back			1
the former @entity23 striker also hit the post in injury time but @entity1 held on for their first win against the @entity28 giants since may 2012 as they became just the third side after @entity30 and @entity31 to beat @entity33 's team in league action this term			2
@entity1 's @entity36 celebrates with teammates after his side 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity3 @entity1 started without @entity40 as the midfielder started the first of his controversial two - match ban for spitting at @entity44 - a punishment issued despite the @entity47 man backing @entity40 's claim he had done no wrong			1
the standard for a frenetic encounter was set after just 30 seconds when @entity12 was booked for clattering into @entity51 , and the hosts went ahead after four minutes			2
@entity53 was allowed to attack down the right before cutting the ball inside for @entity13			2
the @entity1 playmaker tried to find @entity12 but saw @entity57 divert his pass into the box , while @entity60 swiped at fresh air to put @entity3 in trouble			1
@entity12 had continued his run and made the most of the @entity66 's blunder as he turned and fired past the helpless @entity67			2
@entity3 upped the tempo further but first they saw @entity69 make a goal - saving interception after @entity72 knocked a header down for @entity74 , and were then denied by @entity75 as the @entity77 stopper raced from his line to block at @entity72 's feet			1
@entity1 were dangerous on the break though and @entity67 denied them a second goal with a great one - handed stop from @entity84 's drive			1
@entity85 heads the ball past @entity3 keeper @entity67 to double @entity1 's lead @entity3 claimed for a penalty on the half - hour mark after @entity53 barged into @entity74 but referee @entity90 ruled it a fair challenge			1
@entity57 then hit the crossbar just before the break - but the @entity95 did not know much about it			0
@entity72 's near - post corner was punched by @entity75 onto @entity57 's head and it ricocheted onto the woodwork			0
@entity100 followed up but @entity53 was well placed to clear off the line			0
the crossbar rattled again eight minutes into the second half			0
@entity72 showed his bravery as he won the ball in midfield before sweeping it out left to @entity108			0
the @entity110 's cross was poor but @entity53 could only watch with horror as his miscue bounced up against the frame of the goal before @entity115 put the rebound into the side - netting			0
@entity33 hoped to gee up his attack as he replaced @entity108 and @entity74 with @entity17 and @entity119 after an hour			0
but five minutes later it was @entity1 celebrating again			0
@entity121 allowed @entity12 to collect @entity53 's throw down in the right corner and did nothing to prevent the @entity125 rolling into the box			0
@entity1 boss @entity0 masterminded his first victory over his former club there did not appear to be much on but the @entity1 striker stood up a magnificent cross to the far post where @entity13 lay unmarked to squeeze home a header			1
commons hit a weak effort straight at @entity75 while @entity17 saw his close - range strike wrongly ruled out			2
@entity121 had chested the ball down for the @entity139 from @entity72 's cross-field pass but television replays showed @entity142 was playing @entity144 onside as he turned the ball home			0
@entity1 nearly had a third as @entity121 had to block @entity149 's header from underneath his own crossbar			0
@entity20 , who had replaced @entity57 , gave @entity3 hope as he poked through @entity75 's legs from @entity17 's pass before smashing a 20 - yard strike against the base of the post in stoppage time as @entity1 held on .			1

@entity12 and @entity13 scored to give @entity1 victory
@entity17 had a goal wrongly disallowed for the visitors late on
@entity20 pulled one back for @entity3 *shortly* afterwards
