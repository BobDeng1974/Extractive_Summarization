by @entity0 published : 06:50 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 08:07 est , 3 december 2012 a @entity2 team has arrived in @entity3 to begin a search for life in a lake that has lain buried under nearly 10,000ft of ice for up to a half a million years			1
scientists from the @entity10 are preparing to bore down to the subglacial @entity11 , deep beneath the @entity13 ice sheet , to collect samples of water and sediment			1
toiling under the midnight sun , they will endure temperatures well below freezing in a quest to discover whether life can survive in one of the harshest environments on @entity23			1
the @entity11 drill site on the @entity13 ice sheet : four @entity2 scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice should they find any organisms living in the icy depths , it could offer tantalising clues as to how life might look if it exists elsewhere in the solar system , such as in the ice - covered oceans of @entity40 's @entity39			1
the ambitious search comes after a @entity43 team last week announced that they had discovered another lake locked for 3,000 years beneath 65ft of @entity13 glacier was teeming with living organisms			1
but the @entity11 mission will drill far deeper , into a far more extreme environment , which scientists believe has been isolated for at least 100,000 years - and probably much longer			2
@entity51 , a geologist on the team at @entity53 , told the @entity54 : ' extreme environments tell you what constraints there are on life			1
' if we find a particular set of environments where life ca n't exist , that creates some bookends : it tells you about the limits of life			2
' for queen and country : the mission is the most ambitious attempt yet to use hot water drilling to penetrate deep beneath the glaciers which coat our planets southernmost continent one of more than 400 subglacial lakes in @entity3 , @entity11 is equivalent in size to the @entity2 's @entity82 , measuring 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and nearly 500ft deep			1
completely cut off from any light from the @entity84 , any life lurking beneath its waters must endure complete darkness , intense pressure and subzero temperatures			2
it is only geothermal heat from the @entity23 's core and the intense pressure exerted by the weight of the ice above that has kept it liquid			2
four scientists arrived at the camp above the lake yesterday , where they joined a team of engineers who have spent the past month preparing the equipment that will be used to penetrate the icy crust			1
this week they will finalise the preparations for the three - day drilling hot water drilling operation set to begin december 12			0
technology : the @entity10 team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity114 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch under pressure : they will first bore down to 1,000ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second hole all the way down to the lake			1
the cavity will stop geysers of pressurised water from erupting on the surface @entity11 is one of 200 subglacial lakes in the @entity13 : equivalent in size to the @entity2 's @entity82 , it measures 7.5 miles long by 1.8 miles wide , and is nearly 500ft deep it has spent the best part of three millennia locked under a 20m block of ice and is six times saltier than sea			1
and at 13 Â° c below zero , @entity136 in @entity3 is one of the coldest aquatic environments on the planet			0
yet despite posing some of the most hostile conditions on @entity23 , the lake is teeming with life			1
scientists drilling into the lake have found abundant and diverse bacteria - potentially giving insight into how life might exist on other planets , the journal @entity144 reported			1
' @entity136 is a model of what happens when you try to freeze a lake solid , and this is the same fate that any lakes on @entity156 would have gone through as the planet turned colder from a watery past , ' said @entity159 of the @entity160 , @entity161			2
' any @entity156 water bodies that did form would have gone through this @entity165 stage before freezing solid , entombing the evidence of the past ecosystem			0
' @entity159 and his colleagues have drilled into @entity136 twice : once in 2005 and again in 2010			0
@entity136 was originally thought to be an ice block lake			2
however , in 1995 , ground penetrating radar surveys revealed a very salty liquid layer underlying a 20m ice cover			0
the @entity10 team will melt their way into the lake using a 2 mile - long hose tipped with a brass nozzle that sprays sterile water heated to @entity114 at a pressure of 2,000lbs per square inch			1
they will first bore down to 1,000ft , then stop to create a cavity , then drill a second borehole from the surface down through the this cavity and all the way down to the lake			2
the cavity is what controls the pressure of the liquid being drawn from @entity11 , stopping a geyser of prehistoric water from bursting back up through the borehole and spilling out over the surface of the ice			0
once they reach the waters , they will have just 24 hours to sterilise the entrance to the hole with intense uv light and lower a probe into the lake to collect their samples before the hold refreezes again			0
@entity204 , a @entity10 engineer who is heading the programme , spoke to the @entity54 by phone from his tent on the @entity13 ice sheet			0
' it 's bloody cold , ' he said			0
the team will spent six weeks at the site , where temperatures , according to the @entity10 , are @entity213 , with winds of 20 knots			0
for much of that time they will work around the clock			0
' once we 've started drilling we ca n't stop , or the pipes will freeze and that 's that , ' mr @entity204 said			0
' we have to go to a 24 - hour shift pattern for a week and a half to two weeks , and no matter what the weather does , we have to keep going			0
' the location of @entity11 on the @entity13 ice sheet : it is just one of 400 subglacial lakes detected beneath the ice of the frozen southern continent			0

any finds could offer tantalising clues about potential life elsewhere in the solar system , such as on @entity40 's @entity39
mission comes after @entity43 team reports another , *shallower* subglacial lake found teeming with bacterial organisms
