by @entity0 published : 09:58 est , 15 march 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 16 march 2012 the adoring parents of a two - year - old were horrified when they were told their son was a health and safety risk because he is too tall			1
staff at the @entity7 play centre in @entity8 , @entity9 , said @entity10 and @entity11 would have to pay extra for son @entity12 to attend the nursery because he is 3ft 3ins ( 100cm ) tall			1
managers said that , at five - and - a - half inches ( 14cm ) above the average height for a child his age , @entity12 would ' wear out equipment faster ' than the other toddlers			1
wrong fit : @entity11 was told she would have to pay extra for son @entity12 to attend the @entity7 play centre because he is taller than an average toddler mrs @entity11 , 24 , was told that she would have to pay a full child price of £ 3.60 for @entity12 instead of the under - four admission fee of £ 2.20			1
the youngster 's angry parents have hit back at the play centre , saying their son was being discriminated against because he had grown slightly faster than most children his age			0
mr @entity10 , 30 , said : ' @entity29 is tall for his age but , because he is asthmatic , he has had to take steroids from a young age which has probably made him grow a bit quicker			0
' to me it just seems like complete discrimination against my son for being tall			0
' he is only two so he is definitely still a toddler			0
i would say you probably stop being a toddler at about four years old , when you start school			0
' they go there almost every week and he even had his second birthday party there last year			1
unfair : @entity12 , who is 5.5in taller than the average two - year - old , is allowed to play in the same area as other toddlers but his parents must pay extra for the privilege ' on their latest visit , @entity11 went to pay the normal toddler price and was told she would have to pay more			1
' she paid it because she did n’t want @entity29 to know she was disappointed because he was so excited			0
but when they queried it afterwards with the manager they were told , " if you have a tall child then it is just tough "			0
' appalled : @entity12 's mother was told her son was a ' health and safety risk ' at 3ft 3in ( 100cm ) tall mr @entity10 emailed the management team the same day and was told that the decision had been made for health and safety reasons			1
he added : ' it ’s not really about the price , it is more about the attitude that we have been given			0
' a friend ’s daughter , who is one month younger than @entity12 , was able to enter as a toddler			1
mrs @entity11 said : ' last time we measured him he was about 100cm tall , so he is quite tall for his age , but he does have these steroids , and i am quite tall too			0
' when they measured him he just came right up to the line , but that was because his hair was all spiked up			0
' it just seems unfair when my friend ’s daughter , who is just a month younger than @entity12 , is classed as a toddler			1
' he can still play in the toddler area once he is inside because that is done on age , but the price is done on height , which does n’t seem fair to me			2
' on the @entity7 website it states that the toddlers ' area is exclusively for children under four years old or 95cm in height			2
@entity12 will not be three for another two months , but already exceeds the specified height by 5cm			1
manager @entity98 said : ' we do go by height at @entity101 - a bigger child would wear the equipment out quicker than a smaller child would			2
' but if an older child wants to play with their younger brother or sister in the toddler area then we would n’t stop this , as we want the children to be happy and play together , so we can mix and match			2
' we would never stop friends playing together because of their height - that is not what we are about			2
' we try to be as accommodating as we can and make the play areas as safe as possible			0

@entity12 plays in same area as other two - year - olds , but is charged extra
