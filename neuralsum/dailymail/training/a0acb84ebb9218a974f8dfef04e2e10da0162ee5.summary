@entity0 will contest his violent conduct charge with the full backing of @entity3 as the @entity5 leaders make a stand against what @entity7 believes is an orchestrated campaign against his team			1
@entity0 faces a three - match ban after referee @entity12 admitted he had not seen the incident when he appeared to stamp on @entity14 's @entity22 during tuesday 's @entity17 semi-final second leg at @entity18 and set the @entity20 's disciplinary process in motion			1
@entity3 's 17 - goal top scorer had to respond before 6pm on thursday to the charge and , as he has chosen to contest it , the case will be passed to an independent commission to decide on friday			1
the commission will look at video footage , the observations of the referee @entity12 and consider written and video evidence on behalf of @entity0 , who will miss games against @entity30 , @entity57 and @entity58 if found guilty			2
it will be a surprise if he escapes punishment , but @entity0 , @entity7 and others at the club have been incensed by the charge and are determined to fight it			2
@entity7 is in full siege mode ahead of the title clash with champions @entity30 at @entity18 , on saturday , claiming there is an @entity69 agenda fuelled by @entity70			1
@entity3 have also cancelled the manager 's usual eve - of - game press conference , which will prompt another letter from the @entity5 to seek an explanation for breaking their rules on mandatory media duties			1
@entity0 and can clash after the incident , which occurred close to @entity3 boss @entity7 @entity82 midfielder can has to be held back from @entity0 by his @entity14 team - mate @entity83 @entity84 ( left ) and @entity85 both agreed that @entity0 should 've been shown a red card @entity7 has fiercely defended @entity0 , insisting the stamping incident was ' accidental ' @entity0 took part in full training but @entity90 was a notably absentee for the @entity47 from @entity3 's angle , this is a show of solidarity on a point of principle			1
they may not win any friends and may not convince the disciplinary commission that is was an accidental stamp - but the club is standing firm in support of @entity0 because they feel the aggressive elements of his game have been unfairly high - lighted and scrutinised through the season			0
these erupted during the @entity17 semi-final second leg against @entity14 , a game broadcast live on @entity110 , with @entity29 columnist @entity85 on duty in the analysis team			2
@entity3 were not impressed to see ' @entity0 's crimes ' listed on @entity110 , referring to flashpoints from the game			2
@entity7 seems convinced @entity85 , a former @entity14 and @entity116 midfielder , has it in for @entity3 , and that @entity70 , who also happen to pump millions into the sport , pushed the @entity20 towards the charge by looping repeats of @entity0 's challenge on can , and other clashes with @entity83 and @entity124			1
@entity0 lands on @entity83 's left foot as he runs after the ball during the second period at @entity18 the @entity3 man makes contact with his studs but @entity131 believes he deserves the benefit of the doubt @entity0 puts his hand around @entity124 's face as the pair wrestle during the opening period of extra-time the pair go head - to - head late in the game as tempers flare in the @entity17 semi-final second leg @entity124 grabs @entity0 's shirt as @entity146 plays peacemaker by pulling the @entity14 captain away there are parallels to a storm which erupted in october 2005 , after a tackle by @entity153 on @entity154 during a @entity156 game at @entity157 , which was not punished by the referee but later the subject of a two - match ban from @entity161			1
@entity154 claimed it was the worst tackle he 'd suffered in his career , but @entity7 blamed @entity70 for @entity161 's intervention because they replayed the footage so much and refused to do interviews with them for a while			0
@entity3 were without @entity153 for both legs of their tie against @entity171 and were beaten on aggregate			0
it is not the first time @entity7 has mentioned the ' campaign '			0
he was fined £ 25,000 for public comments after a game at @entity179 claiming officials were being influenced by it			0
he was also warned about comments made regarding the need for a ' strong referee ' before a game at @entity185			0
during last season , his first back in @entity187 , he was in trouble with the @entity20			0
he was fined £ 8,000 for going on the pitch during a stormy defeat at @entity57 , when @entity192 and @entity193 were sent off and was fined £ 10,000 for sarcastic remarks about referees ' boss @entity195 after a defeat at home to @entity199 during which his assistant @entity200 was sent off and banned for six games			0
@entity7 was also fined £ 8,000 after he was ordered from the touchline during a home win against @entity205 for an outburst about time - wasting by the visitors			0
@entity192 ( centre ) was sent off for a jump tackle on @entity57 's @entity210 last season @entity7 was fined £ 8,000 for going on the pitch during the stormy defeat at @entity213 @entity153 ( left ) got a retrospective two - match ban from @entity161 for a tackle on @entity154 in 2005 @entity7 blamed @entity153 's ban on @entity70 for @entity161 's intervention because they replayed the footage so much			2
