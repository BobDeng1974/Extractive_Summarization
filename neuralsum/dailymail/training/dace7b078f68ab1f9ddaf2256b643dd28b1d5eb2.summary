but mr @entity8 told @entity48 's today : ' if he were to resign now we would be in a terrible position where every public office holder would be open to blackmail and false stories in the media , triggering their resignation			2
' stepped down : @entity8 quit the cabinet last year amid claims he called police officers ' plebs ' ' anyone who is caught up in the sort of intensive media storm which @entity4 has faced , and which i and my family faced , obviously is in a very difficult position to carry out their job			2
' but in this particular circumstance i am in no doubt that @entity4 should not resign and that he will be able to fulfil his duties as required by the speaker			2
' we have three deputy speakers in the @entity73 so if necessary there can be a degree of burden sharing			0
' he has not been charged , he has not been found guilty , and we do still live in a country where you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty			0
' deputy speaker @entity4 was spoken to about ' inappropriate sexual behaviour ' four years ago , according to reports close up : mr @entity4 appeared to have covered up a scar on his forehead with make - up when he addressed the press outside his home today he said he did not believe there was any truth in the allegations against a friend and colleague of 20 years whom he had known ' in good times and in bad times '			1

' i took the view that i could no longer discharge the duties the prime minister had asked me to discharge and that 's why i resigned			0
' @entity4 , left , and @entity105 stroll through @entity106 on thursday night			2
mr @entity4 is currently on bail mr @entity4 , the 55 - year - old mp for @entity109 , described his arrest and questioning by police as ' the worst 24 hours of my life '			1

the injury was not evident in pictures taken of him on thursday night when he was out in @entity106 with former @entity122 mp @entity105			0
' i was interviewed by the police concerning two complaints , one of which dates back four years , made by two people who are well known to each other and until saturday , i regarded as friends , ' he said			0
' the complaints are completely false and i can not understand why they have been made , especially as i have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week			1
' i appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner and i would like to thank my colleagues , friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and , like me , a sense of incredulity at these events			0
' it has since been reported that mr @entity4 was interviewed by senior conservatives in 2009 over an allegation of ' inappropriate sexual behaviour '			1

the friend said there was no ' verbal warning ' but added that mr @entity4 may have been given some ' friendly advice '			1
the matter was not reported to police and it is understood the man who accused mr @entity4 of inappropriate conduct continued to associate with him			1
@entity95 refused to comment on whether @entity162 knew of the allegations at the time			0
news of saturday ’s arrest at the constituency home of the popular mp for the @entity109 in @entity170 came as a huge shock to colleagues at @entity173 , many of whom spoke out in his support			0
instead of mr @entity4 chairing any commons debates on the @entity35 in the absence of mr @entity32 , that role will be performed by his fellow deputies , @entity182 and @entity183 , commons sources said			2
thorough : officers search the mp 's white @entity186 convertible parked in his home village of @entity22 in @entity170 @entity188 : this image shows mr @entity4 ' village in @entity22			1
his white @entity186 is pictured to the left of the stream in the distance on patrol : @entity196 police officers maintain their presence in the village the decision means mr @entity4 is unlikely to take the speaker ’s chair for at least a fortnight – giving all sides time to consider whether he can continue to carry out his duties while under police investigation			2
he has owned the £ 250,000 two - bedroom terrace cottage – which has a small @entity73 portcullis on its wooden nameplate – for 15 years			0

his 49 - year - old sister , @entity235 , who took over their father ’s newsagent ’s business in @entity225 after his death , said : ‘ the family love him to death and we ’re 100 per cent behind him			1
’ his local @entity244 released a statement saying : ‘ in our democracy everyone accused is innocent until proven guilty and therefore unless @entity4 chooses himself to cease to be our mp or the electorate vote him out or justice system intervenes , we expect him to continue as normal to fulfil his duties in representing the people of the @entity109			2
’ arrested : @entity4 is pictured with @entity162 , who has been informed about the claims quizzed : mr @entity4 is pictured posing with two dancers @entity254 , @entity15 mp for @entity255 and a friend of mr @entity4 , said he had been ‘ deeply disturbed and shocked ’ at his arrest			1

@entity261 @entity15 mp @entity260 , who was accused of a sex assault two years ago only for police to drop their inquiries six days later , also said mr @entity4 should continue			1

@entity15 sources stressed that , as deputy speaker , mr @entity4 does not technically take the conservative whip , so the question of it being withdrawn does not arise			1
the high - profile arrest will fuel the debate over whether anonymity should be granted to those suspected but not charged over sex offences			0
