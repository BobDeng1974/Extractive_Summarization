defensively rock - solid and his floated pass set may clear			0
@entity39 ( @entity40 65 ) - 7 one charged down clearance kick almost led to all black try but otherwise this was a promising performance from the rugby league convert			0

@entity66 ( @entity67 62 mins ) - 7 a couple of sharp jinking runs from @entity0 ’s first - choice @entity70			1

@entity113 - 6 typically high work - rate from one of @entity0 ’s leaders and reasonably effective at the breakdown			1
@entity119 ( c ) - 7 industrious and utterly committed but it was hard not to draw comparisons with opposite man @entity22			1
should he play blindside ? @entity125 ( @entity126 53 mins ) - 7 a couple of frustrating turnovers but carried the ball with menace and caused dents in the @entity8 defence			2
captain @entity119 ( left ) leads a disappointed @entity0 side off the field after their narrow defeat @entity8 @entity55 - 6 completely flat footed for may ’s early try and not at his most effective with ball in hand			1

@entity194 - 7 can consider himself unfortunate to have been sin binned after being wound up by @entity85			0
high work - rate and technically excellent			0
while his kicking was n't brilliant @entity170 was sharp with the ball in hand for the @entity8 @entity201 ( @entity202 48 ) - 6 his powerful charge led to @entity22 ’s early second - half try but was under pressure in the few scrums he was required for			1
@entity207 ( @entity208 40 ) - 6 solid if unspectacular			2
worked hard and ran the line out efficiently before departing at half time			2
@entity212 - 7 under pressure in the lineout but produces so much quality around the pitch			0
@entity218 ( @entity219 67 ) - 7 some thunderous tackling and powerful carrying from the @entity8 ’ hulking blindside			2
@entity223 - 7 still yet to show his very best at @entity6 but made few mistakes and was a constant worry for @entity0			2
@entity22 - 9 did n’t always see eye - to - eye with referee @entity229 but still showed enough class to remind why he is one of the greatest ever players			2

@entity22 the star man for @entity8 in win over @entity0

@entity0 took half - time lead of 14 - 11 after impressive first 40 minutes
@entity2 holders dominated second half until late try for @entity0
