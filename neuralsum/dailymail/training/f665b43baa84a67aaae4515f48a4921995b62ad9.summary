by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity1 will be without the finest player on the planet if @entity4 fails to recover from injury in time to play @entity6 on june 19			1
that is the verdict of @entity1 midfielder @entity8 , who said : ‘ he is the best player in the world			1
and i ’m not saying that because i ’m @entity11 and so is he			0
’ @entity14 ’s 31 - goal star looks like making it back just in time to face @entity16 and @entity17 and @entity8 drives home the importance of his recovery when he says : ‘ as far as i ’m concerned @entity20 and @entity21 are a notch or so below @entity4			1
he has demonstrated it for club and country			0
@entity20 and @entity21 are not as good for their countries as for their clubs			1
’ model : @entity1 midfielder @entity29 shows off the new home kit for the @entity31 @entity4 looks set to miss @entity1 ’s first game of the @entity31 against @entity33 in the hope that the extra days will see him start against @entity6 alongside @entity36 ’s @entity8			1
‘ everyone loves “ @entity4 ” in the squad , ’ he says			2
‘ he is a rebel on the pitch who fights for every ball but that is what we love about him in @entity1			2
we hate to lose at anything , we want to win — so his will to win makes him a good @entity11			0
’ for all the fight on the pitch @entity8 paints a very different picture of his team - mate off it			2
‘ all the @entity36 players were in the dressing room watching on television on the day of the draw and the text messages started flying			2
' there is a group of us who send messages to one another and @entity4 is among that group , although he is one of the quieter ones who does not write that much ; he tends not to get too excited about these things			2
’ race against time : @entity4 is hoping to be fit in time for the @entity6 clash after his knee op group photo : @entity8 ( front right ) lines up alongside @entity4 ( back 2nd right ) ahead of the match against @entity75 in @entity76 last october @entity78 attraction : @entity8 says @entity4 is better than @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) @entity8 defends @entity4 against the accusation that his quest to always finish on the winning side means he crosses the line sometimes			1
‘ he lives for football and in football if you are not alive then you are asleep and they take the ball off you — “ adios ”			0
you have to be smart on the pitch			0
it ’s part of the game			0
you ’ve got the referee there ; he ’s there for something is n’t he ? ’ @entity8 agrees @entity1 and @entity6 are in the group of death but not just because of the presence of three world champions			1
‘ no one should underestimate @entity33 because in a @entity31 anything can happen , ’ he says of his country ’s first opponents			1
on form : @entity4 scored 31 goals for @entity14 in the @entity106 last season eye on the ball : @entity36 's @entity8 trained ahead of the @entity109 final but did not play ‘ people say @entity33 will be the easiest rivals but the temperatures will be high and they will be used to the climate and that could make them stronger			1
’ does he believe a @entity116 team can win this summer ’s tournament ? ‘ it ’s not impossible for a @entity116 side to win in @entity120 but it is a different climate and the pitches are very different — the surfaces are drier and that slows the game down ; and it ’s very humid			0
that is what will test the @entity116 teams			0
in @entity131 the pitches are kept wet and the ball runs faster so it is going to be very different for them			0
‘ there is also the added factor of travelling for @entity116 sides			0
@entity137 is a massive country so we have to travel , too ; but our starting point is a lot closer ! ’ all in : the @entity33 team pose for a photo with president @entity143 ( top row , 7th right ) on friday @entity8 wears the @entity147 kit available from @entity148 , and the @entity149 1.2 tricks available from @entity151 # @entity152			1
