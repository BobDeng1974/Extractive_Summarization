@entity0 has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table looking at a range of living standards			1
obesity levels were the main factor pushing the @entity0 down the health rankings			1
with figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese , @entity0 was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure			1
overall , the @entity0 came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance , putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best - off people in the world			1
@entity0 has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table , put together by a @entity30 academic , looking at a range of living standards overall , the @entity0 came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance , putting @entity0 outside the top ten most civilised and best - off people in the world despite national earnings that make us the world ’s fifth richest country , living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness , particularly obesity			1
we also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance , crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats			2
the findings recorded by @entity58 analysts in a ‘ social progress index ’ suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions			0
the analysts , led by a @entity30 academic , based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country			0
the same thinking has driven @entity72 to order @entity73 to start collecting measurements of happiness and well - being			0
the social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition ; on housing and energy standards ; crime ; education ; health and fitness ; political and conscience rights and freedoms , and levels of tolerance			1
it broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and left - wing thinkers – for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young , if contraception is universally available , and for low greenhouse gas emissions , but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break - up or single parenthood			0
index chief @entity104 said : ‘ overall , within @entity107 the @entity0 ’s ranking is @entity108 : it is more socially advanced than the @entity58 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 or @entity113 , but loses out to all the @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
despite national earnings making the @entity0 the world ’s fifth richest country , living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness , particularly obesity , as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime ( file picture ) ‘ the @entity0 is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness , and like many rich countries the @entity0 ’s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability			1
’ the table – which says @entity135 followed by @entity136 and @entity137 are the best - off countries in the world – lists only four @entity142 countries in the top ten			2
it says that @entity145 , at 31 , is doing less well than @entity146 , @entity147 or @entity148			0
@entity149 is even further down the table , below @entity150 and @entity151			0
@entity0 is first in the world , according to the researchers , for conquering hunger , providing water and sanitation , for electricity supply , a low murder rate , adult literacy , and freedom of speech and movement			1
it also wins top spot for the number of globally - recognised universities , for low levels of women marrying at young ages , and for numbers of mobile phone users			0
however the @entity0 is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease , and 33rd for public concern about crime			2
for freedom of religion @entity0 is 50th , and for religious tolerance 80th			0
there are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use , where we are placed at 82 in the world , and for destruction of wildlife habitat , where we are 53rd			0
for press freedom , the @entity0 is ranked 27th			2
professor @entity187 of @entity30 , who headed the research , said : ‘ a striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress			0

@entity0 ranks as just 27th best country in the world for health and wellness
obesity levels were the main factor pushing @entity0 down in health ranking
study shows @entity0 came 11th in countries with high standards of prosperity
