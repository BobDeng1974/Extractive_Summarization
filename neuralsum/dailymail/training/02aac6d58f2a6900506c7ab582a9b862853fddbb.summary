@entity1 militants are employing identical torture methods used by the @entity4 government they have vowed to overthrow			1
prisons taken over by the @entity7 extremists are now doling out the same brutal practices on their victims , which @entity11 's forces used to punish rebels like them for decades			1
victims of @entity15 claim they are now using well - known punishments like ' the tyre ' , the ' flying carpet ' and the ' @entity20 chair '			1
activists in @entity22 revealed how they were tortured using a method known as the ' shabeh ' , which roughly translates to ' ghost ' in @entity26			2
it involves tying the victims ' arms behind their backs using handcuffs - which are then used to hoist the body into the air , putting extreme pressure on the shoulder sockets			1
@entity36 , who was tortured by an @entity1 leader once imprisoned by the regime , said : ' all you think about is the pain			0
you just have to be patient			0
if you get angry , they will just take your head off			0
you know they want to do it			0
' @entity67 was given the ' shabeh ' every four days for four months until his arms dislodged from their sockets			1
the ghost : the hands are tied behind their back with handcuffs , which are then used to suspend their bodies in the air			2
the @entity20 chair : victims are strapped to a chair whose back is adjusted abruptly at will to cause extreme spinal damage			2
the flying carpet : victims are strapped down to a hinged board			2
the ends are then brought towards each other to bend the spine			0
the tyre : victims are placed inside a large tyre - rendering them immobile - before they 're mercilessly beaten according to @entity92 , reporting for the @entity94 in @entity95 , it took four months for the feeling in his hands to return			2
the repercussions of the same torture still haunt a man simply known as ' @entity101 '			1
he twitches uncontrollably as a result , and hopes to obtain a visa so he can travel to the @entity104 for medical treatment			1
in @entity22 and elsewhere , @entity106 has claimed that torture in islamic state prisons is reaching ' chilling levels '			2
mr @entity67 was also punished with the ' @entity20 chair ' , where his body was strapped to a chair , whose back was adjusted at will to inflict extreme pain on the spine			0
he said : ' they hanged me upside down in an upturned chair			0
' they came and did this every day for four days			2
this is a traditional way to torture people in @entity4			1
they leave you there hanging for anything from two to 12 hours			0
' @entity128 reports suggest the ' shabeh ' has been carried out in the country for years , if not decades			0
earlier this year , @entity1 fanatics left another man , @entity132 , hanging from his wrists for three days			1
two years prior , the same man was arrested by the @entity4 government who tortured him using a method called ' the tyre '			1
he was put inside the rim of a large tyre , rendering him immobile , before he was physically beaten			0
torture : both islamic state militants and @entity11 's regime are accused of using methods of punishment known as ' the ghost ' , the ' @entity20 chair ' and ' the tyre ' regime cruelty : a police photographer who defected from @entity11 's regime , earlier this year revealed graphic evidence 55,000 deaths in state - run prison cells since the start of the uprising			1
inhumane : @entity128 claim that torture in islamic state prisons has reached ' chilling levels ' the cruelty of @entity4 prisons has been well documented for years - long before the revolution inspired by the so - called @entity165			1
now , @entity101 claims they have made ' an art for out of torture			0
in another known as the " flying carpet " , victims are strapped down to a board , and the ends brought towards each other to beind their spines			0

one man 's arms dislodged from their sockets *due* to *constant* punishment
