by @entity0 his @entity2 menu last year consisted of edible fairy lights , tasty tinsel , pork baubles and a partridge in a pear tree			2
and , odd as it may sound , the limited edition festive feast , served at @entity12 's restaurant @entity13 in @entity14 , was such a success that the experimental chef is set to roll it out for a second year			1
this year , the festive menu , created by @entity12 , head chef @entity18 and their @entity21 team , is different - but no less strange			1
festive spirit : last year 's @entity2 menu was such a success that @entity12 will be hosting a special @entity2 lunch in his flagship restaurant in @entity14 , @entity13 , for a second year @entity28 porridge , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 and an advent candle are on the menu , with many of the dishes , fat duck head chef @entity36 tells @entity37 , inspired by ( but not faithfully recreating ) historic festive recipes			1
' with any of these things it ’s more about the idea , ' he said			0
' if you actually tried to follow the recipe , they would n't taste very nice			0
' in fact , they are not recipes as we know them now ; they sound more like a story			0
we adapt it ; we make something new from it			0
' the advent candle , which burns throughout the meal , is cut and served at the end - and found to be made of chocolate with a passionfruit caramel centre			1
mince pies with real spiced , sweetened meat are served towards the end of the meal , and plum porridge - which is a beef broth spiced with orange - served at the beginning			2
a standard @entity2 turkey lunch ...			0
. very unlike what you will get in @entity14 this december and the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , which @entity36 says was created by @entity12 as one of his first festive dishes , consists of lobster consommé reduced until it is a jelly , wrapped in gold leaf and served like a gold bar in a stock made aromatic with frankincense ( a resin from the @entity77 tree ) and accompanied by a whiff of myhrr			1
but will @entity36 be bringing some of his wild concoctions into his own home on christmas day ? ' i 'll be cooking a turkey , ' he said			0
' cover it in gold ? nope			0
the most unusual thing i 'll be doing with it is brining it			0
' the @entity13 - better known for its £ 195 tasting menu which features dishes such as snail porridge , red cabbage gazpacho , salmon poached in liquorice gel and @entity94 , which involves listening to an @entity95 while you eat - will offer the @entity2 experience for three consecutive sundays throughout december - 1 , 8 and 15			1
the menu is priced at £ 350 per person excluding drinks and service charge			1
describing the inspiration for the creation of his first festive feast last year , @entity12 said : ' i 'm basically a big kid			1
i 'm not a scientist - i failed chemistry o - level - i 'm just a bloke who likes to know how things work			2
' and i think @entity2 brings out the kids in all of us - that excitement and the smells and the memories			0
