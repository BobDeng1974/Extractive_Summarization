by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor controversial security firm @entity3 has enjoyed a 20 per cent surge in government contracts despite a string of blunders , new figures show			1
the company - which failed to recruit enough guards for the @entity10 - earned £ 394million from the taxpayer in 2012 - 13 , up from £ 328.5million a year earlier			1
the revelation sparked claims it was becoming the ' private army ' of the state			2
security : the controversial firm @entity3 has seen a 20 per cent increase in its income from the @entity21 government , raising fears of an over-reliance on a ' private army ' with just weeks before the @entity10 opened in july last year , @entity3 admitted it would not be able to provide the thousands of guards it had promised			1
its reputation was severely damaged when 3,500 troops were called in to provide security at the biggest events			0
in the wake of the debacle mps called on the government to think again before awarding more lucrative contracts to the firm			2
but it seems to have done little to dent its reputation in @entity39 , and next week it will provide security guarding the world ’s most powerful men and women at the @entity45 at @entity46			0
@entity48 mp @entity47 , who obtained the figures on government spending with @entity3 , said he was worried about an increasing over-reliance on a small number of companies			1
he warned : ‘ the trouble is a lot of contractors are in a monopoly			2
they do seem to be swelling up and getting bigger and bigger and we are getting to the stage where the over-reliance on one company troubles you			2
‘ i am becoming increasingly worried about the monopoly position that @entity3 have in security services			0
‘ they are becoming the private army of @entity68			2
there is something going on that i think we need to shine a spotlight on			0
’ blunder : the army had to be called in for the @entity10 after @entity3 failed to recruit enough guards last summer @entity76 , who last month quit as @entity3 chief executive , admitted the @entity79 security contract had been a ' humiliating shambles ' for the company but @entity48 mp @entity47 ( right ) , who obtained the figures , warned of a few firms having a monopoly on state contracts most of the hike in government spending on @entity3 contracts was down to an extra £ 51 million spent by the @entity90 on contracts with the company			1
a spokesman for the department said the increase was down to @entity3 being given contracts to run prisons at @entity98 and @entity99 , as well as managing the facilities of a large part of @entity103 's @entity102			0
the @entity104 more than doubled its spend on @entity3 contracts - up from nearly £ 13.8 million to more than £ 32.1 million			1
the @entity21 - based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in @entity110 in 1901			1
@entity3 was formed when @entity111 merged with @entity112 in 2004			0
the company has a long record of blunders including : in 1993 @entity111 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services , m and lost seven inmates in three weeks a year later a hunger striker escaped from @entity121 detention centre , guarded by @entity111 in 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt three prisoners escaped from @entity128 in 2001 in 2011 , @entity3 staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over @entity132 put an electronic tag on criminal @entity135 's artificial limb in 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the @entity138 which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave in march this year a @entity3 guard at @entity142 ordered @entity144 engineer @entity143 to change out of her uniform before flying to the @entity146 because it was ' offensive ' a contract awarded to @entity3 for the government 's @entity149 accounted for the increase , employment minister @entity147 said in his answer to mr @entity47 's question			1
the figures do not include spending by the @entity156 which has not yet answered the mp 's question			2
mr @entity47 said it was ‘ amazing ’ that so much was being spent on @entity3 when it was failing to pay @entity79 subcontractors that were ‘ not complicit in the debacle ’ of the company 's handling of security at @entity10			1
‘ i thought it was amazing that such an amount is being spent on one major contractor , also at a time when we still know that @entity3 have failed to pay subcontractors who have worked for them on the @entity79 site , ’ mr @entity47 said			1
he said some small and medium - sized businesses who worked on the @entity79 site were made to subcontract to @entity3 by @entity176 , but now have not been paid			0
‘ i do n't know why they have n't paid them , it is just bad principles , ’ he said			0
‘ they were told at one stage in the development they were running the logistics and security of the athlete 's village			0
‘ once that was finished they became subcontractors and told to be subcontractors to @entity3			0
‘ one would have thought @entity176 would have leaned on @entity3 to do the honourable thing to the subcontractors			0
‘ they were not complicit in the debacle that occurred when the army came in			0
’ @entity198 , @entity3 ceo of government and outsourcing solutions , said : ' we have been working with the @entity21 government for more than two decades , delivering the highest levels of service and under a high degree of monitoring and oversight			1
' we have won every contract we have been awarded by bidding in a highly competitive environment , based on delivering an effective service for the best deal for the taxpayer , with a number of providers challenging for the work			0
' we have a strong track record of delivering for our @entity21 @entity68 customers and are proud of the service our 11,000 employees provide to them , and the general public , every single day			1
' former @entity3 company boss @entity76 , who admitted the @entity10 contract had been a ‘ humiliating shambles , last month quit his £ 1.2million - a - year role as chief executive			1
he clung on to his job in the immediate aftermath of the @entity10 debacle but the firm ’s reputation suffered badly and in recent weeks poor trading caused shares to slump by more than 13 per cent in one day			2
this month , @entity3 's @entity234 was interrupted by protesters making reference to @entity237 - an @entity238 man who died while being deported from the @entity21 by @entity3 guards			1
in july last year , prosecutors said they would be taking no action against the three @entity3 staff over the death .			0
