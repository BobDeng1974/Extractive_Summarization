when princess @entity1 appeared before @entity2 as a hologram in the 1977 blockbuster @entity4 , it was very much a work of science fiction			0
but fast - forward four decades and the hologram telephone call – which will allow callers to see a live 3d image of the other person on the line – is set to become reality			1
the technology is being pioneered by @entity16 , a @entity17 company named after the @entity4 heroine			1
to make a @entity34 phone call , a person will sit in front of a specially adapted camera featuring two lenses and a microphone			1
the two images the lenses create are blended to form a @entity34 version and streamed via the internet to the person who is being called			1
a hologram machine will receive the image and beam it using a laser projector on to a ‘ screen ’ of water vapour , which gives the image its third dimension			0
the hologram image will speak , move and listen in real time			0
the company also believes its invention will be on the market within five years			1
‘ our holograms will take video - phone calls to the next level , ’ said @entity55 , chief executive of @entity16			1
the firm claims people will be able to use the devise - not unlike a tablet - in their own homes in five years ‘ we are on the frontier of technology that was imagined in movies 40 years ago – it is science fiction becoming science fact			1
‘ it will be as if loved ones , friends and family are standing right in front of you while you talk with them halfway across the world			2
‘ at the moment our holograms are made using machines that are more than 6ft high but we are designing smaller versions that can be set up on a coffee table in a living room			2
ten years ago people would have been astounded at the idea of tablet devices but now they are everywhere			2
' it will be the same with holograms			0
it is still early days but we hope to sell hologram telephone devices within the next five years			0
’ @entity4 was famed for scenes like this where @entity91 appears virtually for a @entity93 meeting mr @entity55 said the possibilities for the technology range from relatives virtually attending family occasions to specialist surgeons overseeing hospital operations while located on the other side of the world			0
he said the company was inspired after noticing the 3d effect created when a nightclub laser is beamed on to dry ice			1
he added that the first systems will cost thousands of pounds but , as with any technology breakthrough , the price will come down once they become more commonplace			0
mr @entity55 also claimed that within ten years we will see the creation of a @entity112 - style fully holographic room , in which 3d objects can be viewed and manipulated from every angle			2
he added : ‘ it is not impossible , and with the technology moving so fast , it is only a matter of time			0
‘ within the next decade we will also be able to watch hologram football matches and have fully interactive walk - in hologram rooms			0
