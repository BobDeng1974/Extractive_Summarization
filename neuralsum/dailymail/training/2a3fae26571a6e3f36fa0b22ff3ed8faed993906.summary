by @entity0 victim : @entity2 , 31 , was stung 40 times last tuesday and died three days later in a @entity5 hospital an amateur beekeeper with a 6 - year - old son has died after what appears to be a fatal allergic reaction to 40 stings			1
april @entity2 was wearing gloves and a beekeeping veil when she was stung by some of the bees that she kept in her family 's back yard in @entity17 , @entity5			1
those precautions did not cover her entirely , however , as many beekeepers regularly wear full suits and high boots to insure that they are entirely covered when they interact with the insects			0
mrs @entity2 , 31 , came into her house on tuesday may 13 and showed her husband @entity24 how she had been stung 30 or 40 times			1

she was rushed to the local hospital but died three days later at @entity28			2
' we all started thinking , " well , how did this happen ? … killer bees or what ? but i guess after she had got stung , her husband called the beekeeper , and he came and figured out there was no queen bee in the hive , " ' @entity41 's uncle @entity40 told the paper			2
' he said if there 's no queen bee in the hive , they get really protective of their hive and they just swarmed her			0
' according to her @entity51 page , mrs @entity2 also suffered from multiple sclerosis			1
hobby : mrs @entity2 , seen with her husband of 11 years @entity41 , was a hairdresser by trade but kept bees in her backyard tragic : the couple has a 6 - year - old son named @entity59 ( pictured with his face blurred because of his age ) ' just a free spirit , nice girl , good mother , ' mr @entity40 said			1
' they just swarmed her , it was a freak thing			0
' agriculture officials are investigating the incident , and have not yet been able to determine if it was an official attack			1
' we 're not certain that this was an attack			0
we feel this is a stinging event , ' @entity73 from the @entity5 @entity74 told @entity76			1
the concern is whether or not the fatal stings were a result of honeybees being cross-bred with @entity82 bees which are generally more defensive and aggressive than the typically - docile bees found across the @entity84			2
' anytime someone is stung and passes away , that 's a serious event , ' mr @entity73 said			2

it ’s unlikely that it ’s africanized			0
