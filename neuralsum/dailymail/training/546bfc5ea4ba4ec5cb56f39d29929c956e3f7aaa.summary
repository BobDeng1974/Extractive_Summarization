the sea of red commemorating the fallen that now surrounds the @entity3 is proving overwhelmingly popular with visitors			2
as @entity10 approaches , the 888,246 ceramic poppies – one for each of the @entity8 soldiers who died in he @entity9 – offer a focus for reflection on the horrors and sacrifice of conflict			1
they have been progressively filling the @entity3 ’s 16 - acre dry moat over the summer , with the final one being put in place on november 11			1
he said : ‘ i read through wills of @entity9 soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed			2
‘ he wrote of “ blood swept lands and seas of red , where angels dare to tread ”			2
it read like a poem and it just seemed to fit			2
’ @entity32 , who is studying for a phd at @entity48 , added : ‘ this is the biggest thing i have done			0
‘ i am amazed that people have taken it to heart			0
’ the @entity54 ’s theatrical designer @entity53 helped realise the vision , and each poppy has been sold for £ 25 , raising millions for service charities			0
respect : @entity59 of @entity60 plants a poppy at the @entity3 in august but how were they actually created ? the @entity63 was given a guided tour of the factory specially set up to make the poppies on an industrial estate in @entity35			1
there , almost 50 workers , most of whom have relatives in the @entity72 , make the flowers by hand ... step one : sliced and squashed step one is to slice the blocks of terracotta clay with a bow saw before it is squashed into thin 4mm sheets in an electronic rolling machine			1
worker @entity84 slices clay so it can be put through a rolling machine and make it thin enough to mould into the correct shape step two : cut like pastry the shape of the petals are stamped out with cutters , almost like pastry , in two different sizes for the two layers of the flower			1
both are clover - like , with three petals			1
@entity101 stamps petal shapes using cutters at the ceramic poppy factory in @entity35 the clay petals are carefully cut out at the factory to make them look as realistic as possible step three : a hole lot of work the two petal shapes are then amalgamated to form the flowers			1
the workers use the tool above to make a hole manually in the centre of each shape , which are aligned as they connect the layers together			1
888,246 poppies - one for each @entity122 fatality - will be installed at the @entity3 memorial by november 11 next step : the two petal shapes are amalgamated and a hole in the centre of the poppy is cut out step four : the flower blossoms the most difficult part of the process is making the final flower			1
each one is different , depending on who makes it			0
the petals on the top layer are lifted up , then those behind are manipulated to subtly support them			0
finally the edges of the top petals are squidged together and shaped to make them look more realistic			0
worker @entity143 concentrates as she carefully moulds the petals into the shape of the flower starting to take shape : the flat shapes are pinched and twisted to make the recognisable flowers ms @entity143 and @entity150 make trays of the flowers before popping them on to trays ahead of a blast in a kiln step five : you 're fired ! the clay flowers are then put on racks around the room for 24 hours until they are ‘ leather hard ’			1
‘ because the kilns are on all the time , it ’s always warm in here , ’ says @entity32			0
‘ so the ambient temperature dries them very quickly			0
‘ the flowers are then put into a kiln for up to eight hours where they are fired up to @entity173			0
’ hundreds of poppies go into the kiln at once , where temperatures will reach upwards of @entity178 the fired flowers are then boxed before being sent to another facility to be glazed bright red step six : double glazing finally the flowers are dipped twice into a scarlet glaze – a base coat and a top coat – and placed back into the kiln where they are heated to @entity190			2
when they have cooled , they are sent to the @entity3 , and put into place , mounted on metal stalks that are stuck into the ground			0
after the glaze , the clay flowers are dried before being sent to the @entity3 to be planted the finished works of art are fitted to metal stalks at the @entity3 before taking their place in the memorial @entity32 , behind @entity202 , holds up one of the finished masterpieces			0

888,246 poppies will form the full @entity208 tribute by november 11
