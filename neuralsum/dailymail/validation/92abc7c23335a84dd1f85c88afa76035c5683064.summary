in terror mr @entity1 was crying which he was mocked for by mr @entity93			2
' mr @entity0 then managed to get hold of knife			2
that caused the top part of his thumb to be sliced			0
' thereafter he described how he was punched a number of times , but when ambulance staff arrived it became clear they were actually stab wounds to his left shoulder and the left side of his head			0
' at that stage they did n't know whether or not mr @entity1 was alive simply because of the amount of blood			1
' in a police interview he told officers it had felt like a dream and he had woken up remorseful for what had happened			0

' but mentally the affect this has had on me has been far harder to come to terms with			0
' in the first four weeks i was bursting into tears very often and my emotions were up and down			0
' i found myself waking in the middle of the night thinking about what had happened - i struggled to sleep			0
' it seemed incomprehensible that this could happened to me			0
' i feel no malice towards him			0
i feel more anger to the @entity149 for putting me in the situation where my safety was at risk			0
' due to this attack i feel no desire towards returning to work			0
i 'm not sure i could sit there and try to help patients again in case i am in a similar situation			0

this is probably a career ending event for me			0
