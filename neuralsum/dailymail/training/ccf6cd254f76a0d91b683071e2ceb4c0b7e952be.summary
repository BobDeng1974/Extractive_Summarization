a @entity2 people - smuggler picks up illegal migrants in @entity4 , hides them in his @entity6 van and takes them to the @entity2 and other countries - for free			1
@entity8 believes it 's the moral thing to do - even though admitting to the illegal smuggling of migrants could get him arrested			1
' i bring them in because the other alternative is them grabbing hold of the bottom of a lorry and they 're going to come in anyway , ' says mr @entity8			2
a @entity2 man , @entity8 , told @entity21 that he picks up illegal migrants in @entity4 , hides them in his @entity6 van and takes them to the @entity2 and other countries without charge mr @entity8 was interviewed as part of @entity21 's dispatches investigation into gangs of people smugglers in @entity4 , who are offering migrants a menu of prices to be transported to @entity2 - ranging from £ 700 ' economy class ' to £ 6,500 to secure a place in a lorry			1
the documentary discovered that the gangs tout for business at the camps referred to as the @entity39 - which have sprung up near the @entity41 port town			1
more than 2,500 migrants from countries including @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 are camped there and are willing to risk their lives attempting to come to @entity2			1
mr @entity8 says he simply wants to fight injustice - at least eight migrants have been killed in @entity4 this year after falling from moving vehicles and two more bound for the @entity2 burnt to death last week in the back of a lorry in @entity54 after an explosion			1
' i understand that it 's called a crime , but i do n't feel as though it is by helping somebody			0
' i 'm trying to make a difference … i do n't fear prison			0
' investigation : @entity21 reporter @entity64 meets an @entity44 woman in @entity4 during filming of @entity68 programme how to break into @entity2 reporter @entity64 , who uncovered these people - smuggling packages for @entity21 , reports that gangs lay claim to certain lorry parks at @entity4 where drivers park up overnight before boarding a ferry			1
while drivers sleep , gangs offer illegal immigrants access to their lorries - for a price			0
@entity80 , an @entity81 reporter working undercover , was offered access to a lorry park for £ 700 , but was told he would have to board a lorry without help			2
he was also offered a £ 1,500 ' business class ' service by a @entity89 gang in nearby @entity54 - for that money they 'd place him securely in a refrigerated lorry			2
' they told me that there are two types of smugglers … each operating different lorry car parks , ' explains mr @entity80			2
' and one is known to be the best , i.e. , controlling a better lorry car park with an easy access and charging more , and the other one , who 's kind of seen as a second layer and slightly cheaper			2
' an image from the @entity21 programme shows tents where migrants hoping to come to the @entity2 live there is no evidence that the lorry drivers themselves are involved in the illegal economy or business class travel packages			1
a ' first class ' service is also offered to migrants , according to the documentary			2
mr @entity80 was told by a middleman in @entity4 that for £ 6,500 a man of @entity81 origin , who appeared to be operating from @entity121 , would provide a designated driver and van to smuggle him into @entity2			2
this first class service differs from the other options in that the driver is aware that he will be smuggling someone in			0
' the man [ offering the service ] was wary , ' explains reporter mr @entity64			0
' he did n't reveal his name or the location of his business in @entity121			0
' for £ 1,500 this @entity89 smuggler , called @entity133 , offered a ' business class ' service - for that money they 'd place him securely in a refrigerated lorry these people - smugglers compete with each other , some even offering money back guarantees			0
of course , most of the estimated 2,500 immigrants in @entity4 ' makeshift camps ca n't afford to pay the smugglers and therefore ca n't access the lorry parks			1
as a result they are more likely to try to jump on moving lorries and get badly injured or in some cases killed – at least eight immigrants have been killed this year falling off of lorries			1
@entity2 lorry driver @entity156 says the number of immigrants trying to board his lorry illegally is growing			2
' it 's changed a lot this last five or six years , ' he says			0
' there 's a lot more of them			0
it 's probably trebled to what it used to be			0
' with fines of £ 2000 per stowaway , however , it would be an expensive disaster for @entity156 if any immigrants were to hop aboard			0
mr @entity64 says : ' the only winners here are the smugglers and the smugglers have blood on their hands			0
' another smuggler called @entity179 offered @entity21 's undercover reporter transport to get to @entity2 migrants break into a lorry as it fills up with fuel in a road close to the port of @entity4 in may one @entity81 migrant , who hopes to get a job in the @entity2 after failing to find work in @entity190 , told the @entity191 : ' there are 15 of us and if just two of us get through in three weeks , it 's a good result			1
' he claimed that some of his friends have been attempting to cross the @entity21 for a month now			0
in response to the vast smuggling operations , local police have increased patrols in the area and @entity2 recently offered £ 12million to the @entity41 authorities to improve security at the port			1
@entity41 police stop a truck carrying @entity210 migrants hoping to be smuggled into @entity2 earlier this year home secretary @entity211 and her @entity41 counterpart @entity212 reached a deal which will also see increased co-operation between the two countries ' law enforcement agencies			1
some of the money will be used to construct robust fences and increase security in the parking area at the port			0
the @entity223 will also second a full - time officer to @entity224 , the @entity41 agency responsible for tackling illegal immigration , while the @entity41 border police will send two officers each month to work with the joint border intelligence unit in @entity230			0
last month a gang of eight @entity232 and a @entity233 were given jail terms by a court in @entity236 after smuggling as many as 2,500 migrants into the @entity2 from @entity4 during an eight - month period .			1
