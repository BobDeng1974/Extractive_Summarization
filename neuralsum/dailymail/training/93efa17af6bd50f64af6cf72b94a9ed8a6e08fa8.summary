by @entity0 now that @entity1 in @entity2 has successfully coerced husband @entity3 into funding a new kitchen for @entity5 - by refusing to cook for him until he did - she is splurging on all manner of trendy appliances and materials			1
the crucial question is , how far should @entity1 go ? does she really need a boiling / sparkling / still water tap and a steam oven ? does an uber - modern kitchen sit well in an 18th century farmhouse ? would it add to the property 's value should they have to sell ? if she were in @entity20 , she should have little fear in splashing out on the kitchen , argues @entity23 , head of @entity24 , @entity25			1
@entity26 : @entity27 relaxes in her elegantly subdued new kitchen ' in today 's world , the kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house - the most important , if it 's a combined kitchen / dining / living room			1
' that holds true , he says , even in the poshest areas			2
' i went to a six - storey house in @entity42 recently where they had moved the kitchen from the basement up to the more formal floor to make it into a family room because , as the owners said , " we live in the kitchen			1
" ' very formal houses will have catering kitchens but in a £ 1 million family home , it 's worth spending £ 15,000 to £ 30,000 on the kitchen , and , say , £ 50,000 on a £ 2 million property			1
' while cautioning against over-specifying everything , @entity23 says : ' do n't be shy in spending good money			1
if it 's suitably exquisite relative to the overall value of the house , it 's worth it			1
' but the story is different in the country			2
@entity68 manages the @entity70 office of estate agents @entity72 covering the entire county			2
' kitchens have saleability , ' he says			2
' but while ultra-modern and trendy retro kitchens are mushrooming in the city , the " @entity20 effect " has yet to reach the countryside			0
some see them as out of character in a period country house			0
check mate : a retro 1950s style kitchen complete with monochrome tiles ' the key to a new kitchen is purpose			1
if you are " turning " the property - doing it up to sell on - you want one that will be desirable , but you need prudence			0
keep it proportionate and bear cost margins in mind			0
if the property is for you to live in , do what you want			0
but refurbishing the kitchen alone will not add value : that has to be reflected in the whole house			1
' @entity68 's motto is ' style and functionality ' - and he points out that he 's seen ' solid , 25 - year - old kitchens that still look immaculate '			1
@entity27 's kitchen in her last house was a case in point			1
fifteen years ago , she installed a traditional , hand - painted kitchen in her 350 - year - old thatched country cottage in @entity116 - and when she sold the property last year , it was still as good as new			1
the formula worked so well for her that she employed the same company , @entity120 of @entity121 , to build a kitchen for her new house , which is ' probably tudor '			1
the property , also in @entity116 , needed a year 's renovation when @entity27 bought it			1
' the kitchen itself was tiny , ' she recalls			1
' it was a wonderful opportunity to start afresh and build an entirely new room			0
' the result is an elegant 540 sq ft kitchen / dining room that , while looking contemporary , is sympathetic to @entity27 's antique furniture			1
at the working end is a black electric @entity134 with a large rectangular island with a walnut top opposite , while the muted tones of the cupboards and drawers make the rest of the kitchen recede into the background			1
the kitchen cost about £ 25,000 , not including building work on the extension			1
@entity147 it for the city : a glossy modern kitchen from the @entity120 of @entity121 range although @entity120 of @entity121 make a range of kitchens , manager @entity151 believes classical ones last longer than hard - edged , modish ones			2
' they out - perform in looks and durability , ' he says			0
his company has been making the same ' artisan ' kitchen for more than 20 years			2
all external panels and doors are factory - painted @entity163 ' which has the toughest wear - rating of any surface '			0
customised colours and work surfaces make each kitchen individual			2
' choose appliances that do what you want , not because they have 300 different programmes , ' he says			0
' remember , wood surfaces can dent and get scratched and will always need oiling			0
@entity177 is unsuitable for kitchen flooring as it is an alkali stone			2
even when sealed it is not impervious to acids such as vinegar , red wine or citrus			0
' @entity185 discovered this , to her cost , in her brand - new , five - bedroom house in @entity70			0
her high - end @entity190 kitchen with two double ovens and integrated everything had a marble floor			2
' my daughter spilt some lemon juice			0
it immediately took the surface off , and got greyer by the day			0
' @entity151 says porcelain tiled floors , indistinguishable from real polished stone , are a better option			0
' real limestone , for example , is both porous and pitted			0
it will stain easily and grind in any dirt			0
' this is not good news for @entity1 on @entity2 , since she has chosen @entity209 limestone tiles			0
if @entity211 spills blackcurrant juice all over it , her wail will be heard all the way to @entity215 .			0

@entity23 of @entity25 says kitchen is most important
*advises* in a £ 1 million family home , it 's worth spending £ 15,000 to £ 30,000
