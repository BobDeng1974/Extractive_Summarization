many unlucky dog owners know just how hard a task it can be to get their pets settled into the back of the car for a peaceful ride			1
getting them out at the end , on the other hand , is the easy part			0
this was not the case for one @entity14 woman , whose hard - headed drive - loving dog refused to budge once she parked her vehicle			1
however , @entity28 proved just how far he was willing to go to press her buttons			1
in the video , the furry monster can be seen jumping across the seats in a bid to stay put while @entity18 grows increasingly frustrated			2
at first she is amused by his cunning plan and instructs him gently : ' tank let 's go			2
come on , we already went bye bye			0
' but as the naughty boy sits wagging his tail playfully and ignores her pleas entirely , her tone takes a different turn			2
barking mad : tank the dog drives his owner @entity50 crazy by refusing to get out of the car in @entity14 ' come on get out			1
tank , out of the car			2
come on , let 's go			0
let 's go , come on			0
' he then decides to provoke her even further by jumping back and forth from seat to seat like a kangaroo , making it even harder for @entity18 to exert her authority			0
' get out of the car ! oh you 're a funny guy , ' she exclaims sarcastically before slamming the door and continuing to shout at him through the open window			1
really ? really ? you 're not funny			0
it was funny for a minute now it 's not			0
get out of the car ! ' @entity73 contacted @entity18 - who adopted @entity28 for $ 45 when he was one year old - to find out what life is like dealing with such a mischievous pet			1
' he understands what i 'm saying ! ' @entity28 is clever than he looks and shows off his mischievous nature by pouncing from the back seat to the front of the car to stop @entity18 from getting him out ' tank does this type of stuff a lot , ' she admits			1
' i really do think he understands what i 'm saying sometimes			0
' i 'll ask him questions and he will respond by putting his paw on me or giving me kisses , or completely running away and trying to hide when i tell him it 's time for a bath			0
' ironically , @entity18 recalls that on the day she and her 12 - year - old son @entity96 adopted the puppy they spent a good half an hour trying to get him into the car to bring him home			1
he was too afraid and even hid under the bucket seats			0
she says : ' now , it 's almost impossible to get him out of the car			2
' however , despite @entity18 's daily struggle , she confirms that @entity28 is ' an amazing dog and the canine love of my life			1
i ca n't imagine my life without him , we really lucked out '			0
car lover : the 3 - year - old dog used to have a phobia of cars , now he wishes he could live inside one			1

tank , a 3 - year - old dog from @entity14 , defies his owner 's authority by refusing to get out of the car
woman 's pleas go ignored *...* then she watches in *disbelief* as the dog *lunges* across the seats
she ends up slamming the vehicle door in frustration while @entity28 stays put
