a popular restaurant has made the controversial decision to add a section to its credit card receipts that gives diners the option to leave a second tip for kitchen staff			1
@entity8 , owner / chef at @entity10 , a popular @entity11 eatery in @entity12 , said he added the second gratuity after two of his cooks left for higher paying jobs			1
' they could n't make it work on their end , and i could n't make it work on mine - this is a small restaurant , ' he told @entity25			1
' but at the same time , the servers are walking away with a lot of money			2
that 's great , but it put an issue in the spotlight that i 've been aware of for a while			0
' would you leave a second tip ? @entity36 , an @entity11 restaurant in @entity12 , has added a second line on its credit card receipts in hopes of retaining its kitchen staff the kitchen gratuity will be divided evenly between @entity10 's line cooks , prep cooks and dishwashers			1
the sous chefs and @entity8 himself will not get a cut			0
traditionally , kitchen staff make a higher hourly wage than front - of - house staff - like bartenders and waitresses - to compensate for the fact they are n't making tips			1
still , the take - home pay does n't even out : according to a study cited by @entity61 , back - of - house workers make an average of $ 18,720 per year while the people in front make $ 24,123			0
mr @entity8 says he hopes other eateries adopt his policy so that ultimately ' the best restaurants would be able to sustain better cooks , rather than losing them to hotels , country clubs , or lounge restaurants that are able to subsidize kitchen labor with extra income			2
' ready for dinner ! @entity10 is located in @entity12 's trendy @entity75 neighborhood restaurant employees are divided about @entity8 's plan			1
@entity78 , a chef at @entity11 restaurant @entity79 in @entity81 , told @entity82 he thinks the kitchen gratuity is ' a little tacky ' and ' overly forward			1
' ' it also pits the servers against the kitchen team , and restaurants tend to work better if the whole joint is pulling together , ' he said			1
@entity79 's manager @entity89 , who is a former waiter , offered another scenario : ' i 've had bad tips before as a direct result of the kitchen screwing up			2
conversely , great food can go unrewarded if the service is bad			0
so in my utopic restaurant scenario , i 'd like to see tips split down the middle between servers and kitchen staff			1
' @entity102 , who worked as a cook in high - end restaurants in @entity105 , @entity106 , for more than 15 years , said @entity8 's plan is something he always wished for			2
' there was nothing worse than working a 500 plate service and then hearing the servers brag about the money that they had made , ' mr @entity102 said			2
' working a friday night dinner rush is probably one of the most stressful things i have ever done			0
having a few bucks tossed my way at the end of a shift like that would certainly make my day			0
' kitchen workers are the unsung heroes of the food industry , and they can make or break a restaurant 's reputation			1
i do n't think there needs to be an industry standard for what to tip the kitchen , but what is it to throw an extra dollar to the cooks ? those dollars would add up			1
' although the industry may be divided , none of the potential patrons the @entity138 interviewed seemed perturbed by the suggestion to leave a second tip for kitchen staff			1
' when a meal is really great , why would i not want to reward the kitchen ? ' said @entity145 , a resident of @entity146 , @entity147			2
. ' i 'm in law school , so it 's not like i 'm exactly rolling in dough at the moment , but a few extra dollars for an awesome meal is n't going to keep me from paying rent			2
' @entity156 resident @entity155 agrees : ' if the restaurant is tiny - which it sounds like this place is - the owner probably ca n't afford to raise the hourly wage by much			2
if this is what i can do to support small businesses that i love , i 'm happy to do it			0
plus , having a second tip section gives you the option to distinguish great food from great service			0
i wo n't punish the server for bad food , and i wo n't punish the kitchen for bad service			2
' mr @entity8 insists that the kitchen tip is completely optional - and he 's reminding @entity10 's diners of this by sending a tiny card out with the bill			1
' at @entity10 , we believe a great meal comes together not from the effort of any single person , but from the successful cooperation of a team of people , from servers and hosts , to cooks and bussers			1
nevertheless , traditional tipping has created a very sizeable gap between the earnings of cooks and servers , and current state law prohibits restaurants from sharing servers ' tips with kitchen staff			1
rather than imposing a mandatory ' service fee ' or ' kitchen surcharge ' as many are doing , we 'd like to leave the choice in your , the diner 's , hands			0
if you 're perfectly happy with tipping as usual , there 's no need for you to do anything differently			0
but , if you 'd like to send a little love to the lads and ladies hustling in the back , we 'd be honored to provide you the means to do so			0
all such tips will go to line cooks and other kitchen staff ; no one in management will @entity220 has many great restaurants , and we 're thrilled you 've chosen to dine with us today			1
we will continue to work hard to bring you the best dining experience we possibly can.thanks for your ongoing support ! ' this is not the first restaurant that has experimented with a different model for paying its employees			1
@entity12 restaurants @entity230 , @entity232 , @entity233 and others have added a 3per cent surcharge to bills to pay for employees ' health insurance , according to the @entity239			1
and @entity241 - star chef @entity240 , who owns @entity242 in @entity243 , recently announced plans to do away with tips and service charges altogether at his new restaurant @entity248			0
instead , he will raise menu prices by 15per cent and pay all employees hourly			0
' this way , price is all inclusive , ' he told @entity253			0
' there 's no healthy @entity243 surcharge			0
there 's no tip , there 's no service charge			0
there 's just one price			0
' i really do think in five years that 's how every restaurant will run			0

@entity12 restaurant @entity10 *implemented* the idea in an effort to keep *talent* from leaving for higher paying jobs
the industry is divided on the plan , saying it could pit servers against kitchen staff
