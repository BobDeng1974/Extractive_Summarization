former @entity1 @entity0 has gone head - to - head with author @entity3 after the writer called footballer wives and girlfriends ' bad role models ' who are nothing more than ' life support systems to a pair of breasts '			1
@entity3 said such women ' live vicariously ' through their partners , while @entity0 - who used to be married to footballer @entity15 - maintained that supporting one 's footballing husband or boyfriend is an arduous and admirable way to live , and should be applauded accordingly			1
the two appeared today on @entity22 's @entity21 to debate the question of whether or not young girls should aspire to be @entity1 , and the audience voted overwhelmingly with @entity3 , who called such women ' sabre - toothed husband hunters whose only skills are sports car alighting with minimum knicker flashing '			1
not doctors or lawyers , just famous			0
wags are just life support systems to a pair of breasts			2
' why do people aspire to be with footballers ? they all treat women like footballs			0
they drop them as soon as they 've scored			0
' @entity0 admonished @entity3 for her cliched , stereotypical view of footballer partners , saying : ' who do you know in the footballing world , @entity61 ? the majority of the girls i know all have jobs , all work , do so much for charity and do great things , and what you are saying is absolutely appalling			1
i have a column in @entity71 and the @entity72 and i do red carpet work			0
and i 'm in a musical about wags			2
you should come and see it , @entity61			0
' @entity3 and @entity0 agreed to disagree on this morning @entity61 said : ' i think wags the acronym stands for worst acronym for girls , ever			1
100 years since @entity82 tied herself to the railings , at the 2006 @entity85 cup we had women aspiring to little more than being a human handbag , draped decoratively over the arm of some knight in shining @entity92 football player			0
' @entity0 fought back , saying : ' i was at both world cups when the media yourselves put them up there as wags , they named us wags they put them on the front of the papers because they were selling the papers			1
people were interested in them , the girls were there to support their husband and i think that is admirable			0
' @entity3 added that her father was a famous footballer so her mother was a @entity1 : ' but she always had a career and independent identity			2
what i disagree with is women living vicariously through men and being seen as subservient and decorative			0
' in the @entity21 worm poll , 76 per cent of viewers agreed with @entity3 that wags are not good role models .			1

@entity3 said wags are bad role models for young girls
@entity0 , *ex-wife* of footballer @entity15 , said wags mostly have jobs
the pair debated the topic on @entity22 's @entity21
