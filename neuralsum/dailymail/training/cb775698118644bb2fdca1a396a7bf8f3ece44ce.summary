@entity0 laid a strong marker with a confident five - try defeat of @entity4 side @entity3 that clinched a double winning start to the new @entity7 competitions for @entity9 clubs			1
after @entity12 's win at @entity13 in the new @entity7 rugby @entity14 the night before , the @entity10 launched their @entity16 with a comprehensive demolition of one of @entity20 's form sides of the season			0
three tries in the first half was the response to a fortunate early @entity3 score and , after soaking up some pressure in the third quarter with a solid defence , the @entity10 added to their lead with a flurry of late points			1
@entity0 had beaten @entity3 at home before , but for the first time in 18 years of @entity7 rugby , the @entity9 team headed into the main tournament with genuine belief of competing with @entity7 's form sides as opposed to mere hope			2
@entity0 fullback @entity40 beats @entity3 centre @entity41 to a high ball in a pool featuring @entity46 and @entity47 , the quarter - finals remain some distance away , but this was as convincing a start as coach @entity50 could have hoped for			1
@entity3 had won four of their first six @entity4 matches , while @entity0 came into the game on the back of a first defeat in six @entity57 games			0
the visitors came shorn of several backrowers , notably @entity61 @entity60 , while @entity0 were also without tal ismanic @entity63 @entity62 , and the @entity10 took advantage by dominating the breakdown and set - piece			0
@entity3 's @entity67 is well tackled by the @entity0 duo of @entity69 ( right ) and @entity70 that ensured that the @entity3 danger - men , fly - half @entity73 and centres @entity75 and @entity41 , had precious little ball and territory in which to cause the kind of havoc in which they have revelled this season			1
@entity83 did put the first points on the board , with a penalty from the @entity10 ' 10 - metre line after just three minutes , awarded for a scrum collapse blamed on home loosehead @entity89 , and @entity20 's ' new @entity91 ' was at the heart of @entity3 's astute kicking game			1
only stern defence , prop @entity95 stopping @entity96 / @entity20 a wing @entity98 and @entity99 getting fingers to a @entity73 pass 15 metres from the line , kept them at bay early on			0
it did not take long for @entity0 to respond once they grasped the ball			0
@entity106 made the first crucial break , rolling @entity108 backwards , and play was taken on into the @entity3 wi th composure and momentum before @entity114 t showed hi s dancing feet to step two defenders and go in under the posts			1
@entity3 fly - half @entity73 gets into a tangle with @entity120 during the clash at the @entity122 however , the capacity @entity122 crowd was still celebrating when @entity3 hit back , @entity83 's high up - and - under being lost by @entity40 's fingertips and @entity41 pouncing to sprint in behind the home posts for a simple try			1
that handed @entity3 a 10 - 7 lead after just 12 minutes , but home fly - half @entity120 shifted momentum back @entity0 's way with two penalties either side of the 20 - minute mark			2
the @entity10 provided the perfect riposte , however			0
the defence was solid , the forwards produced superb work at the breakdown to turn over @entity3 and from a @entity143 high ball , @entity141 regained possession on the visitors ' 22 to launch an attack that ended with @entity147 crashing over on the right - hand side with 29 minutes on the clock			1
@entity75 was then crunched in a tackle that left the centre in obvious rib pain , and while he opted to continue - for a few more minutes - the @entity10 were soon back at the @entity3 line			2
from a free - kick @entity154 fed @entity40 and he found @entity141 who dived into the lefthand corner			0
the @entity159 winger required treatment , having taken a heavy knock to the leg in scoring , but he hobbled back into position to an ovation from the stands and duly claimed the restart			0
@entity0 scrum - half @entity168 dives over to clinch his side 's fourth try and a precious bonus point @entity0 went inside 23 - 10 up , and it could have been more had @entity120 been successful with the conversion and a penalty just before half - time			2
@entity106 was replaced by @entity176 at half - time and @entity3 strived to regain parity in the forward exchanges , sending on experienced front rows @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 and also replacing backs @entity184 and @entity186 with @entity187 and @entity188			1
it stemmed the @entity0 momentum but failed to change the outcome			0
@entity0 's defence was opened up twice by @entity98 and @entity83 , and only a last - ditch tackle by @entity194 and @entity95 denied @entity3 skipper @entity195 from scoring , but the @entity10 soaked up that period of @entity3 pressure and lifted the tempo again in a pulsating final quarter			2
a huge cheer greeted the introduction on the hour of @entity202 , for skipper @entity154 who was voted @entity203 , and within minutes he showed why			0
@entity120 and substitute @entity204 ( right ) celebrate a job well done at full - time the @entity96 magician had seized on a turnover , chipped the ball through the @entity3 defence and reacted first to @entity212 's hack forward to snatch up the ball and score in the right - hand corner - even throwing in a cheeky dummy to @entity216 before doing so			1
@entity120 converted from the touchline for a 30 - 10 lead , but that only fired the @entity10 further and superb inter-play by @entity212 and van der @entity176 ended with another chip ahead and @entity212 touching down with 10 minutes to go			2
@entity3 's spirited attempts to finish with a flourish foundered on the @entity0 rocks , too , which left the home support toasting their team 's most impressive home win in @entity7 .			0

tries from @entity212 ( two ) , @entity147 , @entity106 and @entity168 ensure *stunning* triumph over in - form @entity3
@entity3 could only *muster* sole @entity41 try and five points from the boot of @entity73 in reply
deal to bring @entity236 to @entity3 fell through during the week
