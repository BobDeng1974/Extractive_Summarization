i would n't have missed a drug test like @entity2 how i headbutted @entity3 and gave him a black eye i do n't regret the tackle on @entity7 he did n't even own the bloody thing - @entity9 on the @entity12 dispute i knew @entity13 would rule the world @entity9 has hit out at @entity16 's famous ' class of ' 92 ' by saying their importance to the club 's dominance of @entity22 football has been overstated			1
@entity16 's legendary youth side that won the @entity24 in 1992 contained the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 ; all became vital to later success at @entity34			1
the group of players took their story to the silver screen , releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom			1
but @entity9 , in his new @entity42 , airs his distaste for the ' brand ' of the group			1
he also uncovered a different side to @entity28 , who has always been revered for his squeaky - clean image off the field			1
' @entity28 was a top top player but i still do n’t fall for the boy next door image , ' @entity9 said			1
' or that he ’s dead humble			0
he has more of an edge to him			2
everyone thinks he lives in a council flat			0
' ( left to right ) @entity26 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity27 as the class of ' 92 , which @entity9 says has ' become a brand ' according to @entity9 's new autobiography , @entity58 , @entity28 ( left ) had ' more of an edge to him ' than people thought @entity9 celebrates with one half of the class of ' 92 as @entity26 gives united a 1 - 0 lead against @entity64 in the @entity65 in 2003 with almost 4,000 senior matches for @entity16 and close to 100 major trophies between them , @entity67 clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of @entity73 players since the @entity74 in the 1950s , but @entity9 believes the class of ' 92 ' brand ' has slightly overtaken the team 's own success in that period			1
@entity9 adds : ' the class of ’ 92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated			1
' the class of ’ 92 seems to have grown its own legs			1
it has become a brand			2
it ’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it			0
however , the @entity89 clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful @entity16 youth graduates to date , ' but we all had the same aims			1
we all had the same hunger			0
' ' i wonder about the current @entity16 dressing room			1
when a manager like sir @entity100 is replaced the new man needs a helping hand			0
does that mean every player should like him ? no. ' but i look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better			2
not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best			0
' looking at what happened to @entity110 , i can only conclude that he did n’t have a strong dressing room			2
he had a weak dressing room			0
