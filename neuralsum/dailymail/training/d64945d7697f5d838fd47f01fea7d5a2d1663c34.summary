by @entity0 published : 06:12 est , 20 march 2013 updated : 10:43 est , 20 march 2013 a massive elephant seal held up traffic for more than an hour after going on a walkabout in @entity4			2
but at least the sea animal politely used the pedestrian crossing when it waddled out of the @entity7 on saturday afternoon the surprising sight attracted a large crowd in the coastal city of @entity11 in the southern state of @entity13			1
it initially moved quickly across the road before slumping down in front of a waiting car			0
the confused animal , estimated to weigh over half a tonne , finally sloped off back to the water after nearly 90 minutes in the sun. it is unknown why this giant beast decided to leave the ocean - elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea and only return to land to mate			1
impromptu stroll : it left the beach and waddled along to the busy @entity29 - but of course it politely used the pedestrian crossing rescue : in an effort to keep it hydrated police officers and firefighters splashed water on the 10ft beast back home : an amused crowd gathered around the beast , although it finally sloped off and back to the water after nearly 90 minutes in the sun there are two types of elephant seal , southern elephant seal and the smaller northern version			1
it is named after the males ' snout which resembles the trunk of an elephant			0
the males can grow to be 16ft long and weigh over 6,000lbs their harems can contain several dozen females , which are somewhat lighter on their feet being a fifth of the males ’ size - they are normally about 10ft long and weighing in at around 2,000lbs they can hold their breath longer than any other cetacean animal – they can stay under water without air for up to two hours			0
they were almost hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries but since then the population is estimated to have recovered to about 700,000 members			0
an elephant seal up close : the big beasts can grow to be 16ft long and weigh over 6,000lbs , the smaller females are normally about 10ft long and weighing in at around 2,000lbs			2
