by @entity0 published : 09:32 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 12:38 est , 24 november 2013 @entity2 adores them , @entity1 seems to have a wardrobe full of them and @entity6 never seems to take hers off			1
but it 's not the latest @entity8 must - have that has send the a-list scurrying to the shops			2
instead , it 's the retro scrunchie that has become the talk of @entity14			1
despite being as dated as the shoulder pad and the leg warmer , the 80s classic , as the @entity18 points out , has been enthusiastically embraced by stars hoping to show off their edgy side			2
retro : @entity1 and @entity22 have both been spotted out and about with their hair in a scrunchie favourite : prince @entity27 's girl @entity6 is rarely seen without a scrunchie perched atop her blonde locks what 's more , it 's not just the starry set who have declared a penchant for the scrunchie - the frilly hairpiece has been spotted all over the catwalk too			1
in september , it appeared repeatedly on the runway , with @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 all among those embracing the look			1
so what 's behind the scrunchie revival ? opinion is split , with some pinning it on the @entity48 effect while others cite the 1980s redux that has dominated the high street in recent years			2
' the scrunchie is super 1980s and slightly trashy , and bordered on the naff in the early 1990s , ' hairdresser @entity52 told the @entity18			0
' but the long ones with wire and velvet that you can make bows out of are great			0
' original : @entity61 shows how to work a scrunchie in her 1985 film , @entity63 avoiding the trend : former scrunchie fan @entity61 was last seen in one in 2009 - unlike @entity65 another fan is milliner @entity67 who counts @entity70 among devotees of his sculptural creations			0
' i like the scrunchie look , but it 's better for older women , or underground drag queens , ' he explains			0
he adds : ' i like them if there are lots of them , used to create modern forms , not just something to tie your hair back			0
' but despite approval from @entity67 and @entity52 , one group who wo n't be embracing the look is the team at fashion glossy , @entity92			1
last month , the title included an article that listed five reasons to hate the scrunchie , while calling it an ' unsophisticated accessory ' and declaring that it was a fad they would be sitting out			1
even @entity61 , the woman who elevated scrunchie - sporting to a fine art during her @entity63 days does n't appear thrilled about the renaissance of the frilly hairband , and is now rarely seen in them			0
so will you dare to brave the scrunchie ? it seems that this is one hair trend that could prove just as divisive as it did the first time round .			0
