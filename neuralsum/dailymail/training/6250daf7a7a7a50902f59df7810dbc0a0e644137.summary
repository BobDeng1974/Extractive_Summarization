a fourth man , a former hospital police chief , pleaded guilty in january			2
together , the cases plumbed an online underground where people share macabre fetishes , and the prosecutions hinged on the boundaries between imagining and actually intending to bring fantasies to life			0
guilty : @entity12 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) were both found guilty friday lawyers for both said they would appeal			1
no sentencing date was set			0
' today , a unanimous jury found that the twisted conspiracies of @entity14 and @entity34 were not mere fantasy , but steps within very real plans to kidnap real victims , ' @entity38 @entity37 attorney @entity36 said in a statement , using @entity12 's full name ; he goes by @entity12			1
but defense lawyers said the men 's alleged plans were no more real than the plots of horror movies or violent pornography			0
' we knew , from the outset , that it was going to be difficult to overcome the graphic nature of this case , even though we thought it was pure fantasy , ' said @entity12 's attorney , @entity56			1
@entity12 and @entity14 showed little reaction as jurors delivered a verdict that could put them in prison for life			1
but @entity56 called @entity12 " crushed , " and one of @entity14 's attorneys , @entity64 , said he seemed shocked			1
@entity12 , a former librarian at @entity38 's prestigious @entity66 , and @entity14 , a mechanic from @entity67 , @entity5 , were accused of planning to victimize members of @entity14 's family , including girls under 10			1
@entity12 also was convicted of targeting another woman , who turned out to be an undercover @entity73 agent			1
prosecutors said @entity14 and @entity12 took concrete steps across the line between pretending and plotting			1
they met once in @entity67 and drove around talking about places to dispose of bodies , @entity12 searched online for tips on knockout drugs to overpower potential victims , and @entity14 emailed @entity85 pictures of his possible - target relatives - who included his wife , step - daughter , sister - in - law and nieces , prosecutors noted			2
horrible : @entity12 was part of a plot to kidnap and eat people he 's supposed to protect : @entity95 cop @entity94 is said to have organized the scheme , and reportedly wanted to kill and eat 100 people in the other alleged plot , @entity12 covertly watched the undercover agent and amassed a stock of torture tools , including a 20 - million - volt stun gun , a whip , clamps , skewers and gynecological implements , according to evidence at the trial			1
' none of this was fake , ' assistant u.s. attorney @entity108 said in a closing argument			0
' they were absolutely serious			0
' defense lawyers said @entity12 , 24 , and @entity14 , 61 , were only role - playing and would never have actually hurt anyone			2
@entity14 's supposed schemes were riddled with impossibilities , like kidnapping his sister - in - law from work when she did n't have a job , and he was so far from acting on his desires that he told his wife about them , @entity64 said			0
she suggested jurors ' voted out of fear ' of what might have been if the men were serious			0
@entity12 's lawyer said his client 's discussions and preparations did n't amount to truly planning to do anything violent			2
