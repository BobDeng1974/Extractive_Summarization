by @entity0 with their pristine white sheets , carefully - arranged tea cups and attentive teams of young nurses , the ambulance trains which brought injured @entity2 back from the front could not have been further from the horrors of war the men had lived through			1
the insides of the specially - adapted train coaches were often the first taste of home the wounded soldiers experienced as they made their way back to @entity17 after months spent fighting in the trenches			1
these remarkable images of the @entity21 ambulance trains are now to form part of a new exhibition at @entity25 's @entity24 in november			1
the photos show the trains which brought soldiers back from the battlefield to the @entity31 ports of @entity32 and @entity33 , where they were transferred onto boats before being taken , again by train , to hospitals throughout @entity17			1
but , as the exhibition will reveal , the images contrast with some reports from the time			0
war poet @entity41 described his journey in one of the carriages as a ' nightmare ' in his war memoir , @entity45 , and a nurse documented their ' frightful smells and dirt '			0
as the numbers of those injured in battle rose , so the trains became more important and were upgraded and expanded during the conflict , leading the same nurse to later comment they had become ' a joy after the tragedy ' for those unfortunate enough to need them			1
the exhibition , marking the centenary of the @entity21 this year , will feature a series of images , sketches and personal accounts of the vital role of the railways during it and other conflicts			0
each coach of the train was designated as a ' ward ' and contained thirty - six beds in tiers of three			1
the middle bed folded back to enable sitting patients to use the lower bunk dedicated teams of nurses tended the soldiers			1
one described in her diary how a group of soldiers had been ' picked up without a spot of dressing on any of their wounds '			0
she added : ' the matron , a medical officer , and some of them got hold of some dressings and went round doing what they could in the tie , and others fed them ' trains transported troops through northern @entity31 before others brought them to hospitals from ports in @entity107 and @entity108			1
this photo shows members of the public waiting to view a touring ambulance train at an exhibition at @entity115 station in 1916 a ' standard ' ambulance train consisted of sixteen cars , including a pharmacy car , two kitchens , a personnel car and a brake and stores van a queue of people waiting to see an ambulance train which was on display at @entity128 in november 1917			0
the train was one of those later shipped to @entity31 to bring casualties from @entity133 to the @entity31 ports a train in 1915 being loaded at @entity136 , on its way to the front			1
about 30 trains were sent overseas during the conflict a newly built train on its way to @entity136 docks in @entity144 in 1916 soldiers and medical teams wait for one of the trains to arrive at an unknown station , with stretchers waiting to take the injured on to a hospital the first ever hospital train , the @entity152 , was built and transported to @entity153 to be used during the @entity154 during 1899 - 1902			1
the train supplied the wounded with clothing and toiletries and transported more than 7,000 seriously injured to @entity159			2
in the @entity21 , the @entity17 @entity160 presented the @entity161 with two ambulance trains , specially built and equipped , constructed by @entity163 and @entity164			0
the trains were working in @entity31 during 1915 , with another train , converted from ordinary @entity31 rolling stock , and carried 461,844 patients			2
it was then decided that a number of ' standard ' trains should be built by various @entity17 railway companies to @entity174 specifications , and altogether thirty were eventually sent to the military forces overseas , mostly in @entity31 and @entity133			0
@entity176 , @entity31 , was the principle port for embarkation for the wounded and on one occasion it took only nineteen minutes to unload 123 casualties from a train			2
the main disembarkation points in the @entity17 were @entity107 and @entity108			0
during the war years , @entity107 dealt with 1,260,506 casualties , unloaded 4076 boats and loaded 7781 ambulance trains			1
the patients were then sent by one of the twenty ' home standard ' ambulance trains , or by an emergency ambulance train , to a receiving station , where they were transferred to road vehicles , usually by volunteer first aiders , which took them to their destination hospital			1
there were 196 receiving stations in the @entity17 including @entity25 , where the @entity24 , which is hosting the exhibition , is based			2
ambulance trains were also used during the @entity202 in @entity203 and @entity204 to transfer the wounded to the many temporary and permanent @entity206 for further recuperation and treatment			2
the main train line companies actively helped the @entity210 , @entity211 , and @entity212 with supply and conversion of the ambulance trains and during the @entity202 this was sanctioned by the @entity217			2
by the time of the @entity202 there were about 30 ambulance trains in operation			2
each carriage was painted with a red cross on white background on the roof and side so that enemy planes would identify them as hospital trains and not troop or supply trains			0
under the @entity233 this prevented them becoming a legitimate target			0
the trains could accommodate about 400 lying and sitting patients , in addition to the medical personnel and train crew a cup of tea from a nurse was often the first treatment a soldier got as he headed back to @entity17 picture taken in 1918			1
by the end of the war the trains were a huge part of the war effort and similar trains were employed in the @entity202 the trains often generated their own electricity for lighting and driving overhead fans and all cars were steam heated the mayor of @entity259 and nurses next to an ambulance train during an exhibition at @entity128 , on november 17 , 1917 in a book from the museum 's archive , a nurse describes one experience in ' an anonymous diary of nursing sister on western front ' , as pretty horrendous			0
she wrote : ' they got their @entity272 wounded into cattle trucks on mattresses with convent pillows , and have a twenty hours ' journey with them in frightful smells and dirt			0
they 'd been traveling already for two days ' the same nurse ( not pictured ) went on to describe a completely different experience when the trains were fully converted			0
she said : ' ( the soldiers ) sit up talking and smoking till late , because they are so surprised and pleased to be alive ' it 's hard to know if you 're alive or @entity289 steel and fire go roaring through your head.one moment you 'll be crouching at your @entity292 , mowing heaps down half in fun : the next , you choke and clutch at your right breast - no time to think - leave all - and off you go ... to @entity298 where the @entity300 winds blow , to lovely groves of mango , quince and lime - breathe no good - bye , but ho , for the @entity305 ! it 's a queer @entity307 're charging madly at them yelling " @entity309 ! " when somehow something gives and your feet @entity311 fall and strike your head ; yet feel no @entity313 find ... you 're digging tunnels through the @entity315 the @entity316 , ' cause it 's a rainy @entity318 , springy hay , and lovely beams to climb ! you 're back in the old sailor suit @entity322 's a queer time			0
or you 'll be dozing safe in your dug - out - a great roar - the trench shakes and falls @entity325 're struggling , gasping , struggling , then ... hullo ! @entity326 comes tripping gaily down the trench , @entity328 to nose - that lyddite makes a stench - getting her pinafore all over @entity332 ! because she died ten years ago ! it 's a queer time.the trouble is , things happen much too quick ; up jump the @entity337 , rifles thump and click , you stagger , and the whole scene fades away : even good @entity339 do n't like passing @entity340 or their @entity341 - chanting , and the @entity343 golden harps ... and ... i 'm not well today ... it 's a queer time			0
soldiers standing beside an ambulance train , which were painted with a red cross to prevent them becoming target @entity350 , assistant archivist at the @entity24 , said : ' with the 2014 centenary approaching , our archive and library collections delve even deeper into the story of the @entity21 ambulance train to reveal what it would have really been like for patients , doctors and nurses to travel this way during wartime ' miss @entity350 added : ' our archives contain drawings of fittings , fixtures and layouts providing an insight into what it would really be like for those who lived on the train day - in , day - out , which is a useful tool when wading through wartime morale - boosting propaganda '			1

photos of trains which brought thousands of injured troops back home to go on show at the @entity24
they show the *spotless* bunk beds and crisp bed sheets of coaches later filled with troops wounded in the trenches
the operation of bringing the injured home was carefully planned and involved trains on either side of the channel
dover alone dealt with 1,260,506 casualties and loaded 7,781 train - loads of patients during the conflict
