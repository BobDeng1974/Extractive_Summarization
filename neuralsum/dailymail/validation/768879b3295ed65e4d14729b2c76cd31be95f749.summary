spurs claim him as one of their own			0
@entity4 fans beg to differ			0
but it is starting to get to the point now where , for the rest of football , it does n’t really matter			0
match by match , week by week , @entity9 is announcing himself as the kind of talent who will soon belong to all of us			2
@entity9 did not just score the two clinically taken goals that took @entity0 to victory over @entity18 at @entity19 on saturday and lifted them into the scrap for the @entity22 places			1
he led the line with authority and verve			0
he was not only the best finisher ; he was a constant source of creativity , too			0
the @entity30 manager , @entity29 , watched from the directors ’ box and it must surely have reached the stage now where naming @entity9 in his squad for the forthcoming matches against @entity37 and @entity38 later this month is a formality			1

he has smashed straight through it			0
the sub-plot in west @entity64 was that the @entity0 striker won his personal goalscoring duel with @entity67			1
@entity9 has now scored in six consecutive away games for @entity0 , whose victory took them to within three points of @entity71 , the side sitting uneasily in fourth place			1
@entity9 ’s 15th and 16th league goals of the season also lifted him above @entity60 in the goalscoring charts			2
only @entity79 ’s @entity76 and @entity77 , of @entity78 , have scored more			0
@entity67 did not do his own reputation any harm with another full - blooded performance brimming with threat and endeavour , but he could not prevent his team from being dragged deeper into the mire at the foot of the table			2
@entity67 crashed one left - footed shot off the underside of the bar , leaving @entity92 ruing his side ’s bad luck and complaining about two penalty decisions that did not go his way			2

defender @entity99 was singled out for particular criticism from disgruntled home supporters , but it was a collective failure at the back that undid @entity92 ’s team			0
‘ we need to go away and regroup , ’ the @entity18 head coach said			0
@entity173 had started the match well			0
striker @entity59 forced a flying save out of @entity115 inside 60 seconds but referee @entity137 got his own afternoon off to a poor beginning by awarding a goal - kick			0
spurs soon shook off their uncertainty , though , and five minutes later @entity9 met a cross from @entity116 at the near post with a glancing header and brought a brilliant point - blank save out of @entity184			1
this time , even mr @entity137 realised it was a corner			0
the half sank into a stalemate until a defensive error by @entity116 almost allowed @entity18 to snatch the lead			1
the @entity30 full - back attempted a headed backpass but @entity60 saw it coming and intercepted it , turning it goalwards			1
@entity115 got his hand to the ball and scrambled it clear			0
even though @entity0 were dominating possession and @entity123 was orchestrating play beautifully , the best chance of the half fell to @entity18 after half an hour			1
@entity103 celebrates his goal with @entity18 team - mate @entity201 @entity103 scores from the edge of the area to pull a goal back for @entity18 but they are unable to draw level @entity103 's shot beats @entity115 and goes into the bottom corner of the goal to bring @entity18 back into the game @entity67 has an attempt on goal after beating the offside trap @entity67 watches his shot beat @entity115 but come back off the cross bar and away to safety @entity67 reacts after missing a chance to score for @entity18 during the game with @entity0 @entity219 played the ball into the box and when it ran on to @entity60 , his left - footed rising drive beat @entity115 but smashed against the underside of the bar and away to safety			1
on the @entity18 bench , @entity92 held his head in his hands			0
all of @entity18 ’s efforts were undone 10 minutes before half time when @entity125 floated a free kick into their box			2
none of the @entity18 defenders attacked the ball , @entity97 ducked under it and @entity9 beat @entity43 to the ball to head it past the onrushing keeper and into the empty net			1
luck ran against the home team before the interval when @entity101 ran on to a clever through ball from @entity98 and appeared to be brought down by @entity115			0
to bitter protests from @entity18 , referee @entity137 waved play on			0
@entity9 showed in stoppage time at the end of the half what a fine all - round player he is becoming with a fine pass out to @entity125			1
@entity125 ’s shot took an awkward deflection and @entity43 scrambled to his right to push it out			0
and @entity0 began the second half in the same vein when a ferocious , whipped shot from @entity123 beat the despairing dive of @entity43 only to rebound off the inside of a post			1
@entity0 keeper @entity115 is left standed as @entity18 's @entity101 has an attempt on goal @entity18 striker @entity60 beats @entity264 to the ball and gets his shot away on goal @entity103 looks to win the ball while surrounded by @entity0 duo @entity120 and @entity125 both @entity92 and @entity134 do their best to get their message across to their players @entity18 were desperately trying to stay in touch now and it took some desperate defending to stop @entity0 extending their lead			1
@entity9 showed great vision again to play in @entity116 on the right and when @entity43 smothered his attempted cross , @entity123 followed up with a crisp volley that was blocked on the line by @entity60			2
@entity18 could n’t hold @entity0 at bay any longer , though , and midway through the half , @entity9 put the match out of their reach			1
he beat the offside trap and ran on to a ball from @entity120 , whose energy and ability will also have caught @entity29 ’s eye , before taking the ball round @entity43 and sliding it into an empty net			1
that goal sparked a frantic @entity18 fightback			2
fifteen minutes from the end , @entity67 , who had worked himself into the ground , crossed for @entity59			0
he laid the ball back into the path of the @entity300 , @entity103 , whose neat side - foot beat @entity115 low to his left			2
@entity173 then laid siege to the @entity0 goal in the dying minutes but @entity0 defended stoutly and @entity92 ’s team were left to rue their shortcomings at the back and contemplate an increasingly forlorn fight for @entity310 survival			1
@entity92 , whose side have lost their last three games , was asked after the match whether he would pick @entity9 for @entity30			2
‘ me ? ’ he said , smiling			0
‘ yes , i would			0
but the way i ’m going , i ’m not likely to be in that position any time soon			0
’ @entity219 wins the ball from @entity0 midfielder @entity120 as @entity103 watches on @entity0 defender @entity117 chases the ball under pressure from @entity18 striker @entity60 @entity0 's @entity320 ( left ) looks to win the ball ahead of @entity18 's @entity104 @entity18 's @entity99 gives orders to his team - mates during the game at @entity19 @entity134 and @entity92 shake hands before kick off and share a joke @entity29 was in the stands at @entity19 with a number of potential @entity30 players on display - including @entity60 and @entity9			1

@entity9 gave @entity0 the lead in the first half with a header past @entity43
@entity9 added his and @entity0 's second goal in the second half when he took the ball round @entity43
@entity30 manager @entity29 was in the stands to cast his eye over @entity9 and @entity67

the result leaves @entity18 in the @entity310 *relegation* *zone* while @entity0 climb up to sixth
