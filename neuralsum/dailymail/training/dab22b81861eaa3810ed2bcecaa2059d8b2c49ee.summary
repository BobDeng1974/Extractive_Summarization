victim : three - year - old @entity1 died of tonsillitis after a ' gross failure ' by an out - of - hours gp service with his thick , dark hair and big brown eyes @entity1 was the most angelic - looking little boy			1
the energetic three - year - old loved nothing more than giggling his way through his favourite film , @entity10 — a cartoon tale about a gang of zoo animals who escape captivity			1
but today , his ability to deliver a convincing — ‘ almost scary ’ — impression of a lion can only be a cherished memory for his parents @entity24 and @entity23			2
because at the age of three years , one month and 19 days , @entity1 died of tonsillitis : a death that could , and should , have been avoidable if not for a terrible failure by a @entity30 - born and trained out - of - hours gp			1
‘ if we had been able to see our own gp , who knew us , he would have known whether we were over-anxious parents or whether we had a legitimate concern , ’ says church minister @entity24 , 37 , of @entity31 , near @entity32			2
‘ if we had been able to speak to our family gp that weekend , i believe @entity1 would still be alive			1
’ the family ’s story is a damning indictment of failings in the out - of - hours system — raising particular concerns about the reliance of private providers on foreign doctors , who may have language difficulties and who may not have trained in the @entity49			1
it was in january 2008 that @entity1 began to suffer with the symptoms of a cold			2
the family visited their gp and @entity1 was treated for conjunctivitis , but a couple of days later , he was still very unwell			1
‘ he had foul breath and when i looked on the internet i saw it could be a symptom of tonsillitis , ’ says @entity24			2
‘ when i looked in his mouth there were white spots on his throat , another symptom , so i called the @entity54 , but there was a message saying that because it was out - of - hours — it was a saturday — to call @entity68			1
’ @entity24 duly phoned the service , part of @entity71 , which was formed in 2006 following the merger of two smaller out - of - hours providers			1
after speaking to a nurse and later a doctor , the worried parents took @entity1 to an out - of - hours medical clinic at @entity78 , also run by @entity68			1
they did so , and he was diagnosed with tonsillitis and prescribed antibiotics			2
hospital : @entity1 's parents took him to an out - of - hours clinic at @entity78 where he was given antibiotics the couple took their son home , but the next day he began vomiting and suffering with diarrhoea , symptoms they now know can be an indication of blood poisoning , a rare complication of severe tonsillitis			1
concerned , they rang brightdoc that evening			0
@entity24 relayed @entity1 ’s symptoms and was told a doctor would call back			1
it was 11pm when dr @entity98 phoned			0
@entity24 told the doctor — who trained in @entity30 — he was concerned his son was dehydrated and unable to retain the drugs			1
he asked if he should take him back to hospital			0
but dr @entity98 — who , @entity24 says , seemed to struggle to understand some of what he was saying — insisted there was no need to panic			0
' i knew something terrible had happened			0
@entity1 ’s eyes were open , but he was n’t responding to anything ... it was the worst moment of my life			2
' - @entity1 's father @entity113 @entity24 will never know for sure whether language difficulties had an impact on the doctor ’s decision to tell him not to worry , that it was n’t necessary to take @entity1 for further medical treatment			1
but privately he suspects there was an issue			0
‘ whether or not he fully understood me , i ’m not sure , ’ he recalls			0
‘ i do know that i struggled to get my point across about @entity1 ’s condition , whether that was because of difficulties understanding the language or because he was at the end of a shift , probably a long one , i do n’t know			2
but i do know that at the coroner ’s inquest questions had to be re-asked and rephrased several times for him to fully grasp what was being asked			2
‘ if there is an issue with language , then that person should not be taking calls from patients where they have nothing to rely on other than what is being communicated verbally to them			0
’ but then , the couple had no reason not to put their faith in the doctor			0
‘ he was a professional , ’ @entity24 says			0
‘ we assumed he knew what he was doing			0
’ reassured , they settled @entity1 in a travel cot in their bedroom and hoped that his condition would improve by morning			2
‘ we moved him into our room because we wanted him close at hand , ’ says @entity24			0
‘ the last time i saw him alive was at 3.30am			0
i gave him a bath because of his diarrhoea , and then put him in his cot			0
’ @entity24 woke to the piercing sound of his wife ’s screams at 7.30am			0
out - of - hours : there are concerns language barriers may be a problem when providers source doctors from overseas ( file photo ) ‘ she was frantic , ’ he says			1
‘ i knew something terrible had happened			0
@entity1 ’s eyes were open , but he was n’t responding to anything she did			2
it was the worst moment of my life			0
’ at an inquest into their son ’s death , a coroner said @entity1 had died because of a ‘ gross failure ’ by the out - of - hours gp to provide basic medical attention			1
she criticised him for failing to take proper notes , and for , fatefully , flouting guidelines that state a patient who has contacted the service three times and is continuing to deteriorate should be assessed in person			0
the inquest was told that had @entity1 been taken to hospital , the septicaemia that claimed his life could have been treated			1
for @entity24 and @entity23 , who have three daughters and a baby son , the ordeal of @entity1 ’s death continues with the knowledge that dr @entity198 , who left the @entity49 after their little boy ’s death , returned in 2010 and has been able to continue working here , despite the coroner ’s coruscating remarks			1
‘ there are clearly still holes in the out - of - hours system , ’ says @entity24			1
‘ i sincerely hope lessons can be learned so no other family has to go through such a devastating experience			0
