@entity0 may have been murdered , according to a gunshot wounds expert who has analysed vital forensic evidence @entity0 may have been murdered , a leading forensics expert has claimed			1
the long - held theory that the troubled artist shot himself in a wheat field near @entity8 in 1890 may have to be reconsidered after the shocking claim			1
dr @entity10 , an expert on gunshot wounds , reassessed vital evidence from @entity0 's shooting and believes the painter could not have shot himself in the chest			1
dr @entity10 , a key witness in the trial of @entity18 - the man who was accused of shooting @entity20 teenager @entity19 , used evidence and testimony from the time to come to his conclusion			1
according to @entity25 , the forensics expert told @entity26 and @entity27 - who have long believed that @entity0 did not commit suicide - that the painter 's fatal wounds did not look as if they were self - inflicted			1
according to the son of @entity0 's physician @entity33 , @entity34 , the wound had a ' brown and purple halo around [ it ] '			2
previously historians thought that the purple area was caused by the proximity of the gun to @entity0 's chest and that the brown colouring was caused by gunpowder burns			2
speaking of the ' purple halo ' , dr @entity10 said : ' in fact , this is subcutaneous bleeding from vessels cut by the bullet and is usually seen in individuals who live awhile			2
its presence or absence means nothing			0
' he added that the brown ring was simply ' an abrasion ring and seen around virtually all entrance wounds			0
it just indicates an entrance '			0
dr @entity10 also called into question how @entity0 would have been able to shoot himself in the left side of his chest with the revolver he is alleged to have used			1
' it would be extremely difficult to shoot oneself in this location [ i.e. , on the left side ] with the left hand			0
the easiest way would involve putting one ’s fingers around the back of the grip and using the thumb to fire the gun , ' he said			0
@entity78 , who painted @entity79 a year before his death , was thought to have committed suicide the troubled painter was believed to have shot himself with a revolver in a field outside @entity8 - until now ( pictured : @entity85 , by @entity0 ) ' using one ’s right hand is even more absurd			1
you would have to put the right arm across the chest and again place one ’s fingers on the back of the grip and use the thumb to fire the gun			0
' the forensics expert added that the painter would have had scorch marks on his hand if he had shot himself at such close range , which no testimony from the time suggests was the case			1
@entity26 and @entity27 previously claimed in a biography of the painter that he did not kill himself dr @entity10 's final conclusion read : ' it is my opinion that , in all medical probability , the wound incurred by @entity78 was not self - inflicted			1
in other words , he did not shoot himself			0
' mystery remains over who , if not himself , @entity0 's shooter was			1
it took 29 agonising hours for the artist to die , just days after he had ordered more paints - suggesting he had no intention on taking his own life			0
police are believed to have investigated the shooting briefly but no records remain of what they found			0
whispers around the village of @entity126 , where @entity0 lived and died , at the time of the painter 's death suggested that he was killed by ' young boys '			2
in the 1930s , scholar @entity131 travelled to @entity126 to ask residents who lived in the village at the time of the death what they knew			0
some said @entity0 was shot accidentally by a group of boys and that the painter chose to protect their identity by saying he had tried to commit suicide			1
mr @entity26 and mr @entity27 put their theory to a curator at the @entity145 , in @entity146 , who told them : ' i think it would be like @entity10 to protect the boys and take the " accident " as an unexpected way out of his burdened life			2
' but i think the biggest problem you ’ll find after publishing your theory is that the suicide is more or less printed in the brains of past and present generations and has become a sort of self - evident truth			0
' @entity10 ’s suicide has become the grand finale of the story of the martyr for art , it ’s his crown of thorns			0

forensics expert says @entity78 could not have shot himself
dr @entity10 said evidence suggests he was killed by someone else
historians believe @entity0 shot himself in a wheat field outside @entity8
but the painter could not have held the gun at such close range to his body
even if he could , there would have been scorch marks on his hands
mystery remains over who fired revolver which killed the troubled painter
some say a group of boys killed @entity0 by accident and he took blame
