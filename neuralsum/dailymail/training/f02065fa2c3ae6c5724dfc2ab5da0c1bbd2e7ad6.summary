by @entity0 @entity2 staff are being told not to say sorry when asking grieving relatives if they will donate loved ones ’ organs			1
guidelines instruct them not to use ‘ negative or apologetic language ’ but instead stress the benefits the organs could bring to critically ill patients			1
they have been issued by the @entity2 in the hope of boosting the number of donors , saving hundreds of lives			1
guidance : the advice instructs staff not to be ' negative or apologetic ' when asking about organ donation there are 10,000 patients who need new organs – most commonly livers , kidneys and hearts – and three die every day while on waiting lists			1
but although more people are signing up to be donors , most die at an age when their organs are no longer fit to be given to someone else			0
there are concerns that relatives occasionally override a dead patient ’s wishes by refusing to allow organ donation			0
the @entity2 ’s @entity40 is hoping to change attitudes to the issue			2
@entity43 , the organisation ’s national clinical lead , said the highly sensitive discussions would not take place until families had come to terms with the death			0
he said : ‘ their death is sudden , it is unexpected , it is untimely , it is occasionally violent – a road traffic accident , an assault			2
‘ this is someone you have kissed goodbye on the way to work this morning and now you have been told they are dead			2
‘ decision - making for families in these circumstances is desperately difficult and desperately unstable			0
‘ this is not ( about obtaining ) a “ yes ” at any cost			0
it is about getting the right person there to give the family the best possible support , even if they say no. ’ the guidelines , published this year , tell staff to avoid phrases such as ‘ i am asking you because it is policy ’ or ‘ i am sorry to have to ask you ’			1
support : staff are being encouraged to tell grieving families that , by becoming a donor their relative has a chance to save lives ( picture posed by model ) they should use positive language , such as ‘ by becoming a donor your relative has a chance to save and transform the lives of many others ’			1
the guidance adds that relatives are less likely to refuse if the topic is breeched sensitively			0
‘ the consistent message from the available evidence is that approaching families in certain ways arbitrarily prompts a premature refusal , and that avoiding such pitfalls can result – quite legitimately – in improved rates of family consent , ’ it adds			2
it tells staff to question relatives if they do initially refuse			1
they are encouraged to ask them : ‘ how do you think your husband would feel about organ donation ? ’ the @entity109 says relatives normally only override patients ’ wishes when they had no idea that they were on the donor register			1
this summer the organisation announced that it was considering giving registered donors priority on waiting lists for transplants			0
but critics warn this could unfairly discriminate against those who do n’t want to sign up because of strong religious or ethical views			0
in july , the @entity120 passed a law meaning that from 2015 everyone will be on the organ donor register unless they opt - out .			0

guidelines say not to be ‘ negative or apologetic ’ about the subject
they were issued by the @entity2 in the hope of boosting donor numbers
policy tells staff to avoid phrases such as ' i *'m* sorry to have to ask you '
