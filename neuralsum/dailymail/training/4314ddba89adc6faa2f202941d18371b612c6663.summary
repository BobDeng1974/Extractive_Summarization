@entity0 : @entity1 survived two inquiries @entity3 director of football @entity1 has survived inquiries by both his club and the @entity7 over an alleged racist comment about a member of staff			1
it is claimed @entity1 , a former @entity7 international committee member and @entity13 chairman , described a @entity3 employee as a ‘ darkie ’ while in a group conversation at the training ground			1
there was enough concern around the club , including among some of the players when they found out about it , for the @entity7 to be informed by a third party			1
the @entity7 took the claim seriously enough to conduct a thorough inquiry			2
however , it was found there was no case to answer because none of those involved had made a complaint			0
@entity3 conducted their own probe following the @entity7 ’s verdict and came to the same conclusion			2
a club spokesman said : ‘ this matter was looked into in the correct way and there is nothing further to say			0
’ @entity1 declined to comment on tuesday ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
@entity43 ’s decision not to stand for the @entity45 vice-presidency on @entity47 ’s executive committee gives the @entity7 a golden opportunity to put forward a distinguished former player , rather than one of the suits on the @entity52			1
and with all 54 @entity56 countries voting on the home nations ’ position for the first time — and @entity60 keen to promote ex-players — a popular @entity54 footballer would be a strong favourite to beat the time - servers due to be put forward by @entity64 and @entity65			1
@entity60 was responsible for the choice of former @entity68 goalkeeper @entity67 , who was the most wooden presenter at the @entity71 draw			0
ironically broadcast journalist @entity72 , who had smoothly hosted the previous eight draws when at @entity73 , is now @entity60 ’s media adviser			0
opportunity : @entity43 's not to stand for the @entity45 vice-presidency at @entity47 has opened a spot for an ex-player @entity79 expect sir @entity80 , who is a much better speech maker than his @entity83 commentaries suggest , to be worth hearing when he delivers the 2014 @entity85 at @entity86 on wednesday			1
the talk is being relayed live for the first time on @entity79 ’s @entity90 platform			0
one of the biggest mysteries of transfer deadline day was a certain @entity93 acting as spokesman on the progress of @entity97 ’s move from @entity68 to @entity98			1
it certainly surprised both clubs and the @entity97 family , who represent @entity97 , as none of them had heard of him			0
the unlicensed @entity105 , a self - styled football broker working as a consultant for @entity107 in @entity108 , says he has no involvement with @entity97 but had put his name forward to @entity112 and @entity113 trying to engineer a deal			1
watch this space : @entity79 expect sir @entity80 to be worth hearing when he reads a @entity85 at @entity117 ’s got your number : @entity97 shows off his new no 23 shirt ... but his family deny knowing @entity93 @entity83 deadline disaster @entity124 are having to rethink their transfer deadline - day strategy after monday ’s chaotic coverage			1
this included numerous obscene comments from fans positioned behind @entity83 reporters around the clubs , sex toys being brandished on air at @entity135 and @entity136 and a full - scale @entity138 protest at @entity139			0
the fall - out saw @entity124 boss @entity141 having to account to regulators @entity142 , who received eight complaints about foul language			2
the clubs are also increasingly concerned by @entity83 ’s over-the - top grandstanding on the day			2
a @entity83 spokesman said : ‘ we apologise to those whose enjoyment was spoiled by a small number of incidents and we ’re looking into ways to avoid this happening again			0
’ uninvited guest : a blow - up doll put in an appearance as the clock ticked towards the transfer deadline there 's a buzz about the place : @entity161 had his broadcast interrupted by a fan with a sex toy at @entity136 @entity165 , the former @entity166 managing director imprisoned in @entity167 without charge for nearly four months , has brought in handwriting experts to help show that the signature on documents which former @entity166 owners @entity173 allege involve fraudulent activity is not his			1
@entity175 have paid what looks a high price for their computer problems before @entity179			0
@entity181 rivals @entity180 have won the contract for @entity183 after three summer olympics with @entity175 .			0
