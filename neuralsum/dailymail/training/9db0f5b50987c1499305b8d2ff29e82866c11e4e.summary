a mini-skimmer designed to slip inside of an @entity23 's card acceptance slot : experts warn they are becoming more advanced and commonplace across the world the miniaturized insert skimmer above was used in tandem with a tiny spy camera to record each customer @entity30			1
the image on the left shows the hidden camera situated just to the left of the large square battery ; the photo on the right shows the false @entity23 fascia that obscures the hidden camera as it was found attached to the compromised @entity23 ( notice the tiny pinhole at the top left edge of the device )			0
