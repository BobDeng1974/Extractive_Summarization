for millions of years , asteroid @entity0 has been assaulted by the gravity of planets as it hurtles through space			1
now a new animation , dubbed ' @entity6 ' , follows the rough life of the asteroid and how it could reveal the origin of the solar system			1
it also depicts the @entity13 mission , which will be launched in late 2016 , arrive at the asteroid @entity0 in 2018 , and return a sample of @entity0 's surface to @entity17 five years later			1
scientists think @entity0 formed when some of the rubble from a collision like this coalesced under its own gravity the @entity30 video follows the success of @entity34 's @entity33 mission , which last week captured the imagination of the public after it made a successful landing on a comet			1
unlike comets , which are made up of ice , dust and rocky material , asteroids contain metals from when the solar system first formed			2
' we are going to @entity0 because we want to know what it has witnessed over the course of its evolution , ' said @entity52 of the @entity53			0
' @entity0 's experiences will tell us more about where our solar system came from and how it evolved , ' said professor @entity52			1
an artist 's concept of the young @entity17 being bombarded by asteroids			2
scientists think these impacts could have delivered significant amounts of organic matter and water to @entity17 ' like the detectives in a crime show episode , we 'll examine bits of evidence from @entity0 to understand more completely the story of the solar system , which is ultimately the story of our origin			1
' this mission is a precursor to a bigger mission , where @entity30 will attempt to capture an asteroid and bring it into the moon 's orbit			1
the video opens with an establishing shot of the galaxy and moves in to a nebula - a vast cloud of gas and dust ejected from the explosions of dying stars			0
from observations of other star - forming regions in our galaxy , scientists have a good idea of the basic outlines of how our solar system came to be , according to professor @entity52			1
the animation shows a star disrupting material in the nebula , causing part of it to collapse under its own gravity and form a disk of material surrounding the infant sun. ' we are going to @entity0 because we want to know what it has witnessed over the course of its evolution , ' said @entity52 of the @entity53			2
pictured is a concept image of asteroids being pulled in by the gravity of a planet this is a conceptual image of a nebula			0
nebulas are vast clouds of gas and dust ejected from the explosions of dying stars			0
scientists think the solar system formed when a nearby exploding star disrupted material in a nebula , causing part of it to collapse under its own gravity within this disc , bits of dust are flash heated to molten rock and solidify to become chondrules - some of the building blocks of the solar system			1
how did water come to exist on our planet ? most scientists are of the opinion that it did n't begin here on @entity17 , instead being transported from elsewhere in the solar system , but whether it came from an asteroid or a comet was a mystery			1
that was one of the key questions @entity34 was hoping the @entity33 mission would solve when it arrived at comet @entity154 in august and it may now have an answer that could be verified by the @entity159 lander on the surface			0
using the @entity162 for @entity163 and @entity164 - or @entity165 - the spacecraft ' sniffed ' the comet 's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition			0
it found that water in the comet 's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium - to - hydrogen than water on @entity17			2
this may be the final nail in the coffin for the theory that comets brought water to @entity17 - and it may have finally proven that we have asteroids to thank for allowing life on our planet to thrive			2
chondrules are shown in the animation as they clump together via electrostatic and gravitational forces to become asteroids and planets			0
they also may make up a large part of the material in @entity0			0
' on planets like @entity17 , the original materials have been profoundly altered by geologic activity and chemical reactions with our atmosphere and water , ' said professor @entity52			0
' we think @entity0 may be relatively unchanged , so this asteroid is like a time capsule for us to examine '			0
by studying the sample collected from @entity0 , the @entity30 team will be able to examine some of the most pristine material to be found in the solar system			1
@entity0 may also harbour organic material , which could give scientists an inventory of the materials present at the beginning of the solar system			1
unlike @entity34 's @entity159 probe , which can only study comet material onsite , the @entity13 will bring the material back to @entity17			1
' by bringing this material back to @entity17 , we can do a far more thorough analysis than we can with instruments on a spacecraft , because of practical limits on the size , mass , and energy consumption of what can be flown , ' said professor @entity52			0
' we will also set aside returned materials for future generations to study with instruments and capabilities we ca n't even imagine now			0
' the early solar system is thought to have been chaotic			2
giant impact craters throughout the inner solar system indicate there may have been a ' late heavy bombardment ' by asteroids around 4.1 billion to 3.8 billion years ago , right around the origin of life on @entity17			1
the video shows one theory for this			0
the massive ' gas giant ' planet @entity242 began to migrate inward closer to the sun due to gravitational interactions with the outer gas giant planets			0
@entity242 's gravity disrupted the asteroid belt , tossing many asteroids closer to the sun , where some collided with the terrestrial planets , including @entity17			2
this asteroid bombardment may have been a significant source of organic matter and water for the early @entity17			0
by studying the sample collected from @entity0 , the @entity30 team will be able to examine some of the most pristine material to be found in the solar system			1
pictured is an artist 's impression of an impact on @entity242 's moon , @entity263 measurements reveal that @entity0 's density is less than that of rock , so scientists think the asteroid may have voids in its interior			1
an asteroid like this is called a ' rubble pile ' -- a loosely bound collection of boulders , rock , and dust after this bombardment , things calmed down a little , but massive collisions still happened occasionally , like the one the video shows happening between an asteroid and a planet about one billion years ago			0
the @entity13 ( origins , @entity286 , @entity288 ) mission aims to address basic questions about the composition of the very early solar system			1
the probe will spend more than two years at the 1,760 ft ( 500 metre ) - wide asteroid , named @entity0			2
it plans to return an asteroid sample to @entity17 to reveal the origins of volatiles and organics that may be the seeds of life			1
scientists also hope the mission will accelerate technology that will soon enable humans to mine asteroids for precious metals			0
the spacecraft , scheduled for launch in september 2016 , will arrive at the asteroid in october 2018			1
it will travel 406,618,624 miles ( 654,389,243 km ) to reach the asteroid			0
scientists think a collision like this may have resulted in the birth of @entity0 and the video illustrates the asteroid forming as some of the rubble from the collision slowly coalesces under its own weak gravity			2
measurements reveal that @entity0 's density is less than that of rock , so scientists think the asteroid may have voids in its interior , according to @entity52			2
an asteroid like this is called a ' rubble pile ' -- a loosely bound collection of boulders , rock , and dust			0
@entity0 is also quite dark			0
like an asphalt road on a hot day , it absorbs most of the sunlight that hits it and later radiates this energy away as heat			0
this radiation gives @entity0 a tiny push , called the @entity345 , which gradually changes its orbit over time			0
the animation shows how the yarkovsky effect causes @entity0 to migrate until it encounters a so - called gravitational resonance with the planet @entity351			0
regular tugs by this resonance eventually push @entity0 into the inner solar system , where it has repeated close encounters with @entity357 and @entity17			1
these encounters pull apart the rubble pile that is @entity0 , turning it inside out and reshaping the asteroid			0
because @entity0 comes close to @entity17 , there is a tiny chance – about 1 in 2,500 – that it could hit @entity17 late in the 22nd century , according to professor @entity52			1
' we 'll get accurate measurements of the @entity345 on @entity0 by precisely tracking @entity13 as it orbits the asteroid , ' he added			2

because @entity0 comes close to @entity17 , there is a tiny chance – about 1 in 2,500 – that it could hit @entity17 late in the 22nd century , according to professor @entity52			1

animation , dubbed ' @entity6 ' , follows the *mysterious* life of the asteroid from birth to current position
@entity13 mission will launch in 2016 , arrive at the asteroid @entity0 in 2018 , and return samples 5 years later
the samples could provide scientists with an inventory of the materials present at the start of the solar system
because @entity0 comes close to @entity17 , there is a 1 in 2,500 that the asteroid could hit @entity17 late in 22nd century
it is a precursor to a bigger mission where @entity30 will attempt to capture an asteroid and bring it into moon 's orbit
