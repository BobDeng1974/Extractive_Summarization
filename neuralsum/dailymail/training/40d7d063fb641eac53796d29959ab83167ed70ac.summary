by @entity1 reporter published : 15:08 est , 28 november 2013 @entity3 : 16:47 est , 28 november 2013 a fractured aristocratic family is caught up in a venomous court dispute over the estranged oldest son ’s claims that his grandfather denied him 25 years of income from a 1,000 - acre @entity11 estate			1
@entity12 , @entity13 , 50 , claims the family patriarch deprived him of his due until the day he died , although a 25 per cent stake in the family ’s rolling land - holdings , had been gifted to him in 1983			1
as a result , he lost out on rent , farm yields and income from shooting rights on the estate , in @entity26 in the heart of @entity11 ’s tranquil @entity28 , @entity19 ’s @entity18 has heard			1
@entity29 in @entity11 on 1,000 - acre estate at the centre of the row between the aristocratic @entity13 family however , @entity34 , representing his father , @entity35 , told the court that @entity13 has ' gradually cut himself off from his family ' over the past 18 years , believing his parents were ' responsible for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his nannies '			1
the estate was established by @entity13 ’s grandfather - @entity45 - in 1968 ' in the fervent wish ' that @entity35 and his heirs ' would continue to own and look after the estate for future generations ' , the court heard			1
mr @entity13 , who died aged 95 in 2008 , was the youngest son of the sixth baronet of @entity51 , who ' rescued the family fortunes ' after the @entity53 were threatened by crippling death duties following @entity55			2
@entity35 , now 74 , followed his father into bank notes manufacturing business , portals , where he later became chairman , and is now facing his own son across a tense courtroom			0
during an enormously costly 10 - day trial mr @entity63 insisted that @entity35 and his father had acted in good faith throughout and that @entity13 had always understood that his share in the family trust that holds the estate was given to him by his grandfather in 1983 ' as part of succession and tax planning '			1
' the ( family ) understood @entity13 and his grandfather had reached an understanding at the time of the gift that @entity13 would allow his grandfather to receive all the income from the estate while he was alive , ' said the @entity81			1
' they understood that his grandfather and his wife would continue to occupy their home at @entity87 , on the estate , and generally he would be treated during his lifetime as if he was still the owner '			2
' @entity13 says nobody told him his rights , ' said mr @entity63 , but the barrister argued that the astute economics graduate ' was party to the gift and knew and understood what he was signing '			0
there was , in any case , ' no dispute ' that the estate ’s trustees are ' bound to account ' to @entity13 in respect of his 25 percent share from may 2008 - the date of his grandfather ’s death , said mr @entity63			1
@entity35 insisted in court that his son had been well aware of the true position , adding that he was in line to receive ' a huge benefit - because he would ultimately own 25 per cent of a valuable estate '			2
father and son sat in court just yards apart - separated by a document - strewn desk			0
two of @entity13 ’s siblings - @entity119 and @entity120 - also stepped into the witness box to back their father ’s account			0
mrs @entity120 , 40 , recounted a conversation with her grandfather , when she was aged 16 , in which he ' told me he was passing on his interest in the estate to @entity13 but that he was to keep all the income until he died '			1
' i remember thinking how lovely it was that @entity13 - who at the time was a lovely person and full of life and a great older brother - that the estate would be passed onto the next generation through him , ' she told the court			2
mrs @entity120 , who described her grandfather as a ' wonderful man ' , said he had told her his plan because he ' wanted to share it with me '			0
@entity13 had for years accepted the status quo without demur , claimed mr @entity63 , and his father had described him as ' everything we could have wished for in an eldest son '			0
however , by the end of the 1990s , family relations were becomingly increasingly strained , the court heard , prompting group therapy sessions ' in an attempt to reconcile the family ’ relationship with @entity13 '			0
the family had also made ' strenuous efforts ' to mediate the dispute before reaching court , but without success , said mr @entity63			0
the dispute has its origins in 2005 when @entity13 first challenged his father and grandfather about his entitlement to a quarter share of the estate ’s income			2
@entity13 ’s @entity81 , @entity166 , said it was never spelt out in 1983 that his grandfather was retaining his right to income from the estate			1
' the point of the trust is to effect a gift			0
there was no word about reserving for @entity13 ’s grandfather a life interest in the income of that trust , ' he said			2
' although they knew that the gift was made and , indeed , intended the gift to be made , they did n’t follow it through and give effect to the rights that the gift gave to @entity13			0
' the barrister said that , having gifted @entity13 his 25 percent share , but with his grandfather still needing income from the estate , the trustees were left having to ' square the circle '			1
he added : ' what they actually did was ignore @entity13 from thenceforth			0
' judge @entity196 has now reserved his ruling on the case			0

the @entity201 family own a 1,000 - acre estate in @entity26 , @entity11
grandson @entity13 claims he has been deprived of his rightful dues
he had been gifted a 25 *%* stake in the estate by his grandfather in 1983
family claims there was an ' understanding ' that the grandfather would continue to receive all the income while he was alive
