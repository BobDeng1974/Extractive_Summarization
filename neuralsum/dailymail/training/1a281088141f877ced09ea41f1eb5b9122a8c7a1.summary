there 's plenty of fish in the sea , but this one has come a very long way			0
sustainable fishing campaigners have described the extensive international journey of a @entity8 crumbed dory fillet from the ocean to the supermarket shelf as ' ridiculous '			1
according to the packaging , these dory fillets were caught in @entity14 , then crumbed in @entity15 and then shipped back to the @entity16 , where they were packaged in @entity18			1
at a rough estimate , the fish would have travelled at least 17000km - possibly more - before it finally arrived on @entity18 supermarket shelves			1
' ' we try to source our seafood from @entity18 wherever and whenever possible , however , in order to ensure that we give customers choice , we source seafood from overseas when it is not available locally , ' the spokesman said			1
the fish 's extravagant travel provoked intense commentary on the social media site @entity45 , with some commentators asking ' wtf ' and quipping : ' fresh to you daily ! ' , while others defended it as a common practice			0
more than 70 per cent of fish on @entity18 plates is imported from overseas , according to former chef @entity53			0
he told @entity28 on thursday that the flathead , barramundi , @entity16 dory and prawns sold to @entity18 are often sourced from @entity58 or @entity59			2
@entity61 campaigner @entity60 praised @entity8 for providing more information than is necessary on the packaging , but noted it had travelled absurdly far			0
rough estimate : this is how far the fish would have travelled if it began its journey in @entity69 and ended in @entity70 former chef and food critic @entity53 says much of @entity18 's fish is imported from overseas			2
@entity73 often comes from @entity58 fish often labelled ' pacific diary ' often comes from @entity14 ' the ridiculous distance this fish has travelled , and the carbon miles involved in its transportation , is another good reason to choose locally caught fish , ' mr @entity60 said			1
mr @entity53 said it was evidence of a strange and unsustainable food system			0
' it 's quite a bizarre food system we have where it 's cheaper to ship things across the world and back rather than pay someone to do the work locally , ' he said .			0
