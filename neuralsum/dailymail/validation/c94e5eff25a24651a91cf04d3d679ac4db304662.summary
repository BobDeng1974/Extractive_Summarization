she 's the daughter of the former @entity2 champion @entity1 so it 's little wonder that @entity5 , @entity6 , is a keen fitness fanatic			1
in fact , after starting out with a career in musical theater the pretty 27 - year - old is now a fitness instructor who runs her own training business , @entity15			1
now @entity5 , from @entity16 , has decided to share her story of how she got back into shape in just eight weeks after giving birth to her baby boy , @entity21 , in a bid to inspire other new mothers			1
she said : ' it was amazing and it shocked me that everyone was saying to me , " you 're never going to get your figure back			1
" ' even a midwife - not my own - said to me , " there 's nothing you can do , your boobs will be saggy , you 'll never get your stomach back			1
" ' and i just thought it was very demoralising for me and for that to be the message going out to other women			2
' @entity5 says that having being made to feel like there was no hope she made it her mission to prove people wrong			1
she said : ' in the end it was the best thing they could have said to me			2
i made it my mission to get back into shape and i even posted about it on my social media , i said to people , you can follow me as i do this			2
@entity5 poses with her adorable son @entity63 , who was born at the beginning of january @entity5 , who works as a fitness instructor , put on weight as her bump grew during pregnancy @entity5 shared a photograph of herself on her first day back at the gym , she has since regained her impressive abs ' some people commented saying , " i ca n't believe you 're so self obsessed " , but it 's not about that , it 's about being happy and healthy and for me that means being in good shape			1
it 's important to feel good about yourself			0
' @entity5 says she carried on teaching her exercises until just five weeks before @entity21 's birth , but that did n't stop her putting on weight when she was pregnant			1
the usually slim and toned @entity86 said she put on over two and a half stone			0
' i was still teaching my classes up until about five or six weeks before he was born , ' she said			2
' i obviously was n't lifting any heavy weights any more but i was keeping active and i have a chocolate labrador so he always needs walking			0
she continued : ' they say you put on about two and a half stone during the pregnancy but i had put that on by six months and you could really see it in my face			0
' i would be lying if i said it never bothered me , there was one time i wanted to buy a dress and it was the kind of thing i would have always loved to wear but i just could n't			0
' but i made the choice to become a mother and i think pregnant women look beautiful			2
' @entity5 's first run came 15 days after she gave birth , she jogged for 15 minutes and says it 's important to build up your exercise regime slowly @entity5 says one of her favourite things to do is to put on her music and dance around her house @entity5 regularly shares photographs of herself enjoying her work outs on @entity29 @entity5 has been showing off pictures of how her body has been changing , these pictures were taken 15 days after she gave birth to @entity21 @entity5 , who has worked with the pop singer @entity125 , revealed that when it came to getting back into shape , she found it was important to take things one step at a time			1
she said : ' i had to accept , you know , i 'm not going to have two hours to go to the gym			0
but you just have to fit it in where you can			0
' i do my exercise in short sharp bursts so if that baby is sleeping for an hour i might do half an hour of exercise			1
' i 'm lucky enough to have a garden so i 'll pop outside where i will do some high knees , jumping jacks , burpees , press ups then some tricep drips and sit ups			0
' and she 'll even dance around her house in a bid to get fit : ' one of my favourite things to do is to put some music on my headphones and just dance around my bedroom			0
' i must look completely crazy to anyone if they looked in but i love dancing - i used to do musical theatre and also one of the things i missed the most when i was pregnant and having a baby was being able to go out to a club and dance			2
' @entity5 , pictured here on her wedding day with her father , is the daughter of former @entity2 athlete @entity1 @entity5 's @entity167 gives her away at her wedding to her husband @entity169 , they now have a son together named @entity21 @entity5 says she started exercising again almost as soon as @entity21 was born : ' i started on day two , i started walking and i went for my first jog after two weeks - it was just 15 minutes but you can build up from there			1
' when my husband is home at the weekend , i 'll have breakfast and sometimes go to the gym for an hour			0
' i 'm breastfeeding which also burns a lot of calories and i 'm lucky that i can express my milk and leave it with @entity31 while i pop out			0
for me it is a priority to be healthy and i want to be an inspiration for other women			1
' i do n't want to be a size zero , i enjoy the feeling of exercise and doing good for my body			2
' @entity5 says she did put on weight while she was pregnant but that it did n't bother her too much because she feels pregnant women are beautiful @entity5 gives her little boy @entity21 a kiss as they pose for an adorable family photograph @entity5 says she eats healthily , but unlike a lot of dieters she does n't cut out carbs			1
' i ca n't have white bread but i have wholemeal bread and lots of eggs and lean meat like chicken and fish			0
' people always say you should avoid carbs but for me if i want to keep my muscle and burn fat i have to eat carbs so i will have rice and pasta			0
she adds : ' one of my tricks is to carry dry cereal around in my bag , people always laugh but i hate the feeling of being hungry and that 's far better than eating a packet of crisps			0
' as a new mother you know you sometimes do n't have time to prepare extravagant meals so i eat a lot of fruit and veg and toast			0
' @entity5 says she tries to do four things a week whether they be a jog or dancing around her room , fitting in her exercise when baby @entity21 is sleeping			1
and her hard work has been praised by her friends			0
