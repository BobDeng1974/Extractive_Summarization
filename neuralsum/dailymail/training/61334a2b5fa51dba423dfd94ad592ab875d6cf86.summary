by @entity0 published : 18:51 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 16 january 2013 a jury heard today that @entity2 called her ex-boyfriend 's cell phone four times after she stabbed him to death in his shower			1
prosecutors say the latest evidence in the ongoing trial about the murder of @entity2 shows that @entity15 was trying to cover up her tracks by listening to - and potentially deleting messages on his phone - after she killed him , which @entity15 admits to committing but says that she stabbed him 27 times in self defense			1
an expert from phone company @entity25 took the stand in @entity27 , @entity28 , saying that @entity15 placed a call at 11.37pm - just six hours after @entity30 was killed			1
prosecutors argue that she left the voicemail messages in an effort to cover her tracks			0
the phone expert said that one call shows that @entity15 dialed into @entity30 's voicemail system after his death and stayed on the line for 16 minutes			1
because she did not leave any message , prosecutors argue that she was listening to and potentially deleting messages from the dead man 's cell phone			0
on the opposite end , the defense attorneys suggested that she did n't actually delete messages but she was simply recording and deleting her own message that she was going to leave for her dead ex before finally giving up and not leaving one in the end			2
' on @entity25 , is it possible to change your voice mail , to erase it and do it over again ? could someone have been doing that for a 16 minute phone call ? ' defense attorney @entity72 said			2
' yes , ' @entity77 records expert @entity76 testified in court			0
different versions : @entity15 has changed her story a number of times , and is now pleading not guilty saying that she killed @entity30 in self defense even though she initially said she was never in his apartment on the day of his death throughout the day on tuesday , the jury was shown hours of footage of @entity15 in the interrogation room with the lead detective over the course of multiple interview sessions in 2008			1
at one point - clearly before she admitted that she killed @entity30 - she pleads with the detective , saying : ' if i killed @entity98 i would beg for the death penalty			2
' ' i have to maintain my innocence but i ca n't admit to something i have n't done , ' she said at another point			0
during one of the earliest questionings , she asked the detective how many times @entity30 was stabbed , and detective @entity106 said ' more than i want to remember '			0
in the courtroom , @entity15 was visibly moved by the footage and had to cover her face at points as she cried			1
' obsessed ' : @entity15 , 32 , allegedly stabbed @entity2 , pictured , 27 times and shot him in the head happier times : she met @entity2 , a @entity117 and motivational speaker , at a @entity119 conference the footage showed the vast series of different stories that @entity15 told in the months following @entity30 's brutal june 2008 murder , including one where a male and female attacker were the ones who killed @entity30 while they were together in the shower			1
at another point , she explained her reticence of telling the detective any details came because she ' has seen the @entity133 ' and feared that @entity30 's supposed killers would come after her mother and younger brother as retribution if she talked			0
the review of the interrogation footage signals that the prosecution is winding down in terms of their evidence before the defense takes their turn			2
@entity15 is expected to testify , if nothing else than to simply clarify why she would need to make up so many stories her claims of self defense are true			1
she faces the death penalty if found guilty			0
@entity2 hid her face and wept in on monday as the court was shown sexually explicit photos of her with ex-boyfriend @entity2 just hours before he was brutally murdered			1
detective @entity156 told the @entity27 court on monday that he had recovered the deleted pictures from the victim 's camera			0
@entity15 shielded her face with her hair and touched her eyes with a tissue as the prosecution showed jurors naked photographs of the pair taken around 1.45pm on june 4 , 2008			2
' last photo ' : among the images on the camera was this one showing @entity98 in the shower before his death seedy : the images from the camera were time - stamped as june 4 , 2008 several hours later , at 5.30pm , a series of photographs show 30 - year - old @entity30 in the shower with the water running			0
the images appeared to have been taken by someone else			0
around 45 seconds later , according to the picture 's time stamp , jurors were shown a photograph of the bathroom ceiling that appeared to have been taken unintentionally when the camera dropped			0
less than a minute later , a grisly photograph was taken which apparently depicts the back of @entity30 's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck			1
it is alleged that it was mistakenly taken as @entity15 dragged her ex-lover 's body through his @entity196 home after stabbing him 27 times			1
