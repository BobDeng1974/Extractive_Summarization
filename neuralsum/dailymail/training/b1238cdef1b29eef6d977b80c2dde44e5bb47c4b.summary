gentrification is out as a new phenomenon sweeps the cities of @entity3			2
instead of neighborhoods gradually increasing in social status , some are now being ' youthified ' , according to new research			0
the trend of youthification describes the growing influx of young adults , those aged between 25 - 34 , into higher density cities			1
the cities with the lowest proportion of residents aged 25 - 34 are clustered in the northeastern rustbelt			1
apart from @entity19 those with the highest are all further west , as this map of @entity3 shows @entity22 , those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s , are ' youthifying ' cities across @entity3 the phrase has been coined by @entity25 , a geographer and urban planner at the @entity27 in @entity28			1
as reported by @entity30 , @entity29 describes youthification as different from gentrification - ' a series of stages involving ever slightly wealthier but more risk averse in - movers ' - because ' the former is not explicitly a class - based process , although the two are not mutually exclusive			2
' @entity25 explains youthification as a process that occurs in discrete stages			2
it begins as younger people move into relatively inexpensive neighborhoods , such as those with spaces leftover from de-industrialized manufacturing districts			0
as youthification continues , newer rental housing and smaller one - bedroom apartments are built and amenities flood the neighborhood , drawing greater numbers of young people even as living costs rise			2
some of these areas remain ' forever young ' , with new cohorts of young people continuing to move in as families and children head towards the suburbs in search of more space			2
@entity63 ' online project @entity64 charts the most youthified cities in the @entity66 and @entity28 , according to the proportion of 25 - 34 year - old residents living there			1
@entity70 tops the list with 16.93 per cent of its population falling into that age category , ahead of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity19 and @entity77			1
@entity78 and @entity79 also rank highly			0
@entity81 and @entity82 , two rapidly growing cities in western @entity28 , rank third and fourth while @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 lag behind in 24th , 31st and 33rd place out of the 57 largest metropolitan areas in the @entity66 and @entity28			1
unsurprisingly the rustbelt cities of @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 come at the bottom of the list			1
to answer the question of what causes youthification , @entity63 conducted a detailed statistical analysis of factors that might be associated with the movements of young people - such as household income , household size , the share of potential gentrifiers and the share of immigrants - across @entity28 's three largest cities between 1981 and 2011			1
while @entity63 finds several factors - including household income , household size and immigration - to be associated with higher density , he found the connection between density and age of residents has increased substantially over time			1
this is true in @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity84			0
in the former the correlation between young people ( aged 25 to 34 ) and density - where -1 indicates a total negative correlation , 0 no correlation at all and +1 a total positive correlation - grew from .22 in 1981 to .66 by 2011			1
in @entity86 , it went from .36 to .62 and in @entity84 it increased from .49 to .68			0
the associations between density and older age groups ( 44 - 54 and 55 - 64 years old ) have generally moved in the other direction , indicating these individuals are moving toward the lower - density suburbs			2
in @entity86 and @entity85 , there is a negative correlation between people aged 65 and older and density			0
@entity70 in @entity139 has the highest proportion of young adults than any other @entity3 city this points to growing geographic segregation of age groups in the city			1
in the case of @entity63 suggests this divide has become a ' generational bifurcation , ' where older and young people live in the inner cities and those in middle age live in the less dense suburbs			0
he suggests these changes grow out of a number of socio - economic shifts			0
young people in the @entity66 and @entity28 are experiencing less job security , more chinks in the social safety net , high housing prices , delayed childbearing and a growing enthusiasm for urban living			1
for these reasons , renting closer to the city centre , where increasing stocks of terraced housing and apartments are readily available , becomes a more attractive option			0
it remains to be seen whether this pattern will last and whether those who move to city centres in their 20s and 30s remain there to raise their children or move out like their predecessors			0
as @entity63 notes , the generational divide he observes is not nearly as stark as that of ethnic or class segregation			0
but , he adds , ' there are clear signs of a process of youthification underway that is indeed creating generationed spaces in our cities that if intensified in the future could lead to further inter-generational conflict			0

new study of ' youthification ' shows young adults aged between 25 - 34 are flooding into higher density cities across @entity28 and the @entity66
phrase has been coined by @entity25 , a geographer and urban planner
it is becoming more noticeable than gentrification in some neighbourhoods
@entity70 , @entity75 and @entity81 are the most ' youthified ' urban areas
@entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 have lowest proportion of young adults
