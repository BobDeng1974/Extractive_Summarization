by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 10:55 est , 8 july 2013 @entity1 sat shoulder to shoulder with political leaders , sporting stars and a certain @entity5 turned fashion mogul in a @entity7 heaving with household names as @entity9 battled his way to victory at a sweltering @entity12 yesterday			2
as the @entity14 beat the world number one @entity15 to become @entity18 champion in a gripping straight sets victory , he was roared on by everyone from @entity20 to hangover - star @entity21 , and @entity22 to @entity23			2
@entity18 legend @entity24 , who claimed victory at the @entity25 no less than four times during his career , sat next to labour leader @entity28 , while @entity29 and actress and model @entity30 added to the glamorous female contingent absorbing all the action on @entity34			2
household names : film stars @entity21 and @entity37 took their seats alongside @entity20 and prime minister @entity23 to watch from the @entity7 as @entity9 stormed to victory at @entity18 as the eyes of the country focused on this small corner of @entity12 yesterday afternoon , the best seats in the house were reserved for an eclectic mixture of high - profile fans			1
many of those taking their seats in the @entity7 were former players who once reigned supreme on @entity18 's grass courts themselves ; from @entity50 @entity49 - who held the trophy aloft in 1972 - to @entity53 @entity52 , who was crowned champion in 1966			0
former @entity57 number one @entity55 also brought along wife @entity58 to enjoy all the action courtside			0
@entity60 : upping the glamour stakes in the @entity7 were @entity20 , who kept her cool in a black dress as she took her seat next to @entity66 's wife @entity65 , and @entity29 , who wore a white dress to watch the action on @entity34 alongside her husband @entity69 girls ' day out : fast friends @entity20 and @entity65 sat side by side to watch @entity9 storm to victory at @entity18 yesterday and it was n't just champions from the tennis world taking their seats in the exclusive section - footballer @entity22 watched alongside wife @entity29 , while golfing star @entity80 , there to take in the match with his wife @entity82 , was spotted laughing with actor @entity37			1
@entity37 , the star of @entity84 blockbusters including 300 and @entity85 , attracted almost as much attention as his fellow countryman @entity9 's efforts on court yesterday , as he and fellow film star @entity21 brought a dash of a-list glamour to the box in co-ordinating summery blue suits and shades			2
star power : actors @entity21 and @entity37 caused a stir as they arrived in the @entity7 in co-ordinating blue suits to watch @entity37 's fellow countryman @entity9 take on @entity15 bromance : @entity98 star @entity21 spent as much time chatting to fellow actor @entity37 ( left ) as he did his girlfriend ( right ) , @entity57 model @entity30 seating arrangements : while her boyfriend @entity21 had his friend @entity37 sitting on his other side , model @entity30 was flanked by the former @entity108 governor sir @entity107 on her right @entity21 was also accompanied by his girlfriend , @entity57 model and actress @entity30 , but seemed to pay more attention to @entity114 as the pair played up to the cameras capturing their every reaction to the increasingly tense match			1
ms @entity30 meanwhile was left to chat to the @entity108 governor sir @entity107 , who was sitting to her right			0
the world of politics was also well represented , with prime minister @entity23 applauding @entity9 's every winning shot from the front row , accompanied by his mother @entity122			1
behind him was @entity124 's first minister @entity123 , who was branded a ' grade one wally ' for gleefully unfurling a giant @entity128 flag behind mr @entity23 as @entity9 was crowned victor - in what many saw as a political ploy to gain support for @entity124 independence			1
also looking on were @entity134 , @entity135 , and her husband @entity136 , and @entity138 general sir @entity137 , while acclaimed classical pianist @entity141 , wearing a quirky pair of glasses , appeared deep in conversation with the @entity143 in the front row			0
there were jubilant scenes in the @entity7 as @entity9 sealed his much longed - for victory to take the title , but not everybody in the section was entirely thrilled with the result			2
sitting alongside @entity28 's wife @entity152 was @entity153 , the @entity154 president , who was no doubt disappointed to see @entity15 dispatched in straight sets by the @entity14			1
political heavyweights : @entity124 's first minister @entity123 sat behind prime minister @entity23 , left , while @entity159 leader @entity28 sat behind the @entity143 - who is president of the @entity25 royalty : the @entity143 ( front ) chatted with acclaimed classical musician @entity163 , while @entity28 and his wife @entity152 watched the match from the row behind former stars : @entity168 , the former @entity57 number one , watched the @entity14 and the @entity154 battle it out alongside his wife @entity58 in soaring temperatures on @entity34 eclectic mixture : @entity28 shared a joke with four - time @entity18 champion @entity24 in the @entity7 , as @entity29 and @entity22 , and @entity20 and @entity65 watched from the rows behind sporting champions : the @entity7 was awash with sporting talent yesterday , and not just from the world of tennis ; footballer @entity22 was there , left , as was @entity181 born @entity180 golfer @entity80 , right the @entity7 has been reserved for the entertainment of friends and guests of @entity18 since 1922			1
the guest list is made up of members of the @entity57 and foreign royal families , heads of government , big names from the tennis world , the tournament 's commercial partners and the @entity193			0
representatives of prominent media organisations , supporters of @entity57 tennis are also among those lucky enough to make the cut			0
invitations come from the chairman of the @entity202 , and take into account suggestions from members of @entity205 and the @entity206 along with other relevant partners			0
the jovial atmosphere evident in the @entity7 yesterday will have continued after @entity9 raised the trophy , as guests are invited to the @entity211 for lunch , tea and drinks at the end of the day			0
prime minister @entity23 's suit and tie provoked a lot of reaction on @entity220 given the soaring temperatures , but he was merely following protocol , as male guests in the @entity7 are asked to wear smart dress such as a suit or jacket and tie			1
ladies are asked not to wear hats to prevent obscuring the view of those sitting behind them .			0

@entity21 and @entity37 *rubbed* shoulders with golfer @entity80 and former tennis *greats*
@entity20 watched alongside @entity65 as @entity9 stormed to victory over @entity15
