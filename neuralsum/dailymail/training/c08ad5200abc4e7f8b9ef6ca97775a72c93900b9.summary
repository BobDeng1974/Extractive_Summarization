in the last few years , the beard has had a renaissance			2
no longer just the preserve of tramps and lumberjacks , it is now seen on lawyers , bar staff and artists across the western world who have wanted to add a bit of edge to their look			2
the move has not gone unnoticed by the fairer sex , many of whom are delighted at the new facial hair trend			1
so it can only be good news that a new dating website has emerged , specifically linking up beard lovers with men who have beards			1
the site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users @entity31 from @entity32 launched @entity33 six weeks ago and already tens of thousands of people have signed up			1
he started the project as a bit of a joke after suggesting the idea on @entity39 and seeing a positive response from his friends			2
the ( bearded ) 28 - year - old software developer said : ' when i posted the question on my @entity39 page , my friends said they thought it was a really good idea			2
' so i made this fake landing site where people could sign up to this app that did n't really exist , just because i was curious to see how far people would go with it			1
' in the last week alone , more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site he continued : ' i wanted to see who was willing to go through the hassle of signing up , giving their email address , etc. ' after 100 people signed up in four days , i thought there must be some scope , so i made a proper website and launched it four weeks ago			1
' it has kind of got a little bit out of hand at this moment , so i 'm just kind of going with it , which is great fun			0
' @entity31 from @entity32 launched bristlr six weeks ago in the last week alone , more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site and when the @entity73 and @entity74 apps are launched in a couple of weeks , those numbers are likely to grow even faster			1
@entity31 admits he ca n't believe how successful it has been so far , especially as it started out as a bit of a joke			0
he said : ' we are comfortably in the five figures now			0
it does surprise me because i 'm very cynical and i think it is such a stupid idea that no one is going to want to do it			0
' but it turns out that actually , people think it 's kind of cool			1
i 've started to talk to the people using it , and some say that it is the best dating site they 've ever used			2
' i think it 's the fact that instead of it being this serious business like “ hey , if you click this button we 're going to do this serious thing , ” it 's more like “ hey , i like your beard			0
” ' it ’s light - hearted - you ca n't take it too seriously , which i think is really appealing to people			2
i did build a block button just in case though , because inevitably there are going to be creepy dudes			0
' i ’m sure there will also be guys who go on there without beards to try and pick up women , but they 're not going to have much luck			2
' the site uses a minimal amount of information from users , so as not to be too invasive			2
but it does keep a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50			1
@entity31 said : ' i 've been quite surprised by the ratio of beards to people looking for beards			1
' the site keeps a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50 ' we do n't track whether people are male or female , just whether or not they have a beard or they are looking for someone with a beard - we track the import stuff			1
' it 's just under half of people who have beards on @entity33			1
' i think i was expecting it to be 90 per cent people with beards			1
' that is n't the only surprise , @entity31 is also amazed by the different countries around the world where the site has already become a hit			0
he said : ' it 's only international by chance - because i was too lazy to limit it when i was building the site			0
' the site is already in the @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and the @entity162 he continued : '' it 's really big in @entity160 and i had someone from @entity166 today tell me it is now getting quite big over there , which is ridiculous			1
' @entity170 was one of the first cities to embrace it			0
' it 's catching on slowly in @entity175 , but i feel like they 're slightly more cynical about it			0
' @entity31 admits that it may just be a craze while the beard trend lasts , but he is enjoying it while it does			0
he said : ' i know beards are definitely in , people have realised they are kind of lovely			1
invest in some nice beard oil , get a good pair of trimmers and just experiment			0
if you feel good in your beard then that comes across as confidence			0
a good beard does n’t replace your personality but it does compliment it			0
' i get that it is personal preference , just like some people like short hair and some like it long			1
' i know some people who are repulsed by beards and some people just love them			1
' you can tell a lot about a man by his beard , not that they just have one , because they may have just forgotten to shave			0
' but just like seeing someone with a really nice suit or haircut , a nice well - kept beard shows some pride in appearance			0
