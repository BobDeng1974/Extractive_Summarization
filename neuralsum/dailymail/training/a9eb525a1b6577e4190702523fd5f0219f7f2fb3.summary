by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 13:04 est , 3 december 2012 thousands of thrill - seekers kicked up a storm in dune buggies on the @entity4 to celebrate @entity5			1
also known as the @entity4 , the @entity7 desert scene plays host to an annual , yet free - form celebration where people let loose in an array of colourful vehicles			1
visitors flocked to the mounds of golden sand which have accumulated in the far corner of the south east of the state - around 150,000 people attended in 2011 and this year is estimated to have a similar turn - out			1
the dunes stretch for eight miles by 40 , holding no vegetation and tends to appear as a block colour scene - clear blue sky above , bright gold sand below			2
there were no officially planned races or events and there are no titles to be won ; everybody turns up simply to tear up the desert			0
the smell of burning petrol accompanies the buggies which travel at break - neck speed around the dunes			0
turn up : around 150,000 people tend to make their way to the dunes for @entity5 and this year 's turn - out appeared to be similar chicken : a man sprints across the sandy floor in a fancy dress costume as he gets in the carnival atmosphere of the gathering catch me if you can : the man in the chicken suit ploughs on across the tricky terrain while a dune buggy comes storming down a mound of sand illumination : buggies have light - sticks attached to them as they continue the fun at night @entity99 colours : the blue , cloudless sky above and the golden sand below is the typical way the @entity7 desert looks , before the riders fill it with colour zoom : a trail of sand is dislodged by one rider while several other buggies shoot off in the opposite direction unorthodox : this rider rears up the beast of a vehicle he has brought to the @entity7 desert to go wild in when the night comes the riders strap lights to their vehicles and continue , illuminating the desert in different shades of neon			1
officials encourage riders of the off - highway vehicles to buckle up - it is not uncommon for deaths to occur during the exciting celebration			2
' each year , serious injury and death could have been prevented with the use of these safety restraints , ' said the @entity135 's field manager @entity134			0
' a safety campaign urging visitors to " @entity138 " has been ongoing since the start of the season			0
' from january 1 , 2013 , new health and safety laws will require all riders to wear a safety harness or seat belt and be 16 or over , unless directly supervised			0
spread out : the area is eight by 40 miles and the buggies and bikes line up as far as the eye can see stars and stripes : this buggy carries the flag of the @entity155 as it goes about its business in the sand lined up : sand duners relaxing before the party really kicks off on the @entity4 glowing tracks : riders create bright paths of light amid the sand which spans the floor of the desert region good health : there has , at the time of writing , been no deaths reported at the 2012 @entity5 meet at the @entity4 party time : the gathered crowd watches as a rider whizzes by on his small quad - bike style vehicle big boy : this mini bus was one of the larger vehicles to dare to enter the desert lightsabers : riders have a campfire in front of an array of glowing vehicles @entity189 orange : one rider pulls up the front of his buggy as he whizzes across the sand to create a gritty orange trail in his wake holiday tradition : some riders like to cook a turkey at the dunes and there are instructions on how to at @entity202			2

the traditional celebration sees around 150,000 people make their way to the @entity4 to wreak sandy havoc
