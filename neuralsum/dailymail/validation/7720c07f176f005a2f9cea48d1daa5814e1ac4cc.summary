we knew from that moment we needed to act fast			0
' our wedding day was the best day of our lives , it was perfect in every way - i just wish i could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks			0
' it was mine and @entity3 ’s dream to get married and thanks to our family , friends @entity70 and @entity72 , and local businesses , we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late			2

fibrosing alveolitis is a relatively rare lung condition which causes scarring and thickening of the alveoli - tiny air sacs - leading to shortness of breath			1
developing over a number of months or years , the condition is difficult to treat and is usually long term			0
in some cases , fibrosing alveolitis is the result of an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the body ’s own healthy tissues			2
however , about half of all cases are idiopathic , which means no cause can be identified			0
' it was the most magical day and we will never forget it			0
' @entity3 ’s wedding day was provided free of charge by @entity111 , manager at @entity112 , @entity4 , who arranged for the registrar and 100 guests to attend the ceremony			2
' i ca n’t believe how amazing our local community has been , they ’ve made mine and @entity3 ’s dream come true and it ’s a day we ’ll never forget , ' added @entity12			1
' she looked beautiful on our wedding day and our boys @entity10 and @entity23 really enjoyed themselves too			2
' before the wedding we sat down with the boys and the @entity126 to tell them that their mummy is going to die			0
cuddle time : @entity3 gives her young niece @entity128 a hug the happy couple smile during the civil ceremony with their young sons acting as ring bearers ' that was the most difficult and heartbreaking thing we have ever had to do			0
' family friend , @entity70 , decided to help raise funds to pay for specialised treatment for @entity3 in @entity139 by taking part in the 10km @entity142 @entity141 in may and so far has pledges amounting to £ 5,000 via her @entity145 page			2
' i 've known @entity3 for years as our mums were best friends , ' she said			2
' i decided to raise funds for her to go to @entity149 for a life - saving transplant but @entity3 ’s health deteriorated so rapidly and after being given just weeks to live , that was no longer an option			1
sealed with a kiss : @entity12 kisses his bride who is having the wedding day she dreamed @entity12 and @entity3 relax with their sons @entity23 and @entity10 at their home in @entity4 ' the money raised is now going towards sending her boys to @entity45 as we managed to tick off her dream wedding without dipping into it			1
' i ’m over the moon that her big wedding day was organised so quickly and that her boys will hopefully get the chance to go on holiday as well			0
' ' @entity3 has been through so much in her short life , ' said @entity12			1
@entity3 is pictured here on the left with her sister @entity172 two years ago , before her lung condition worsened ' her mother , @entity174 , died of lung cancer at just 39 , when @entity3 was pregnant with our eldest son , @entity23 , so she never got to meet him			1
' then in 2006 , @entity10 was born and at four months old he was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung			2
@entity10 spent seven months in hospital and was later diagnosed with the same disease as @entity3			1
' we now have the worry that he too will end up like his mum , although he is a normal healthy boy at the moment			0
' the wedding helped us to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute			0
