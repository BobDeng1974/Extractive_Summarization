by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 27 november 2013 taxpayer - funded electric - car subsidies worth £ 5,000 per vehicle are still failing to spark real interest from drivers in ‘ green ’ motoring , a new report says today			1
only 1 per cent of @entity9 drivers currently own an alternative fuel vehicle ( @entity11 ) , it says			1
and ‘ green ’ concerns such as low co2 emissions are at the bottom of the checklist when @entity9 are shopping for a new car , says the poll of more than 3,000 motorists by @entity19			2
unpopular alternative : only 1 per cent of @entity9 drivers has an alternative fuel vehicle such as the electric @entity22 subsidy : more than a third of drivers were unaware of the £ 5,000 government subsidy for new electric cars since january 2011 , motorists have been eligible for a £ 5,000 @entity30 - backed subsidy on the full purchase price of a new electric vehicle , such as a @entity22 , a @entity34 i3 or a @entity35			1
but the @entity19 survey showed that 35 per cent of drivers were unaware of this grant			2
while 32 per cent of 17 to 24 - year - olds said they were likely to buy an @entity11 , only 18 per cent of those aged 65 or over were likely to			0
the survey also showed that while 62 per cent of women said they cared deeply about the impact their cars had on the environment , only 39 per cent of men did			0
the poll also found that 79 per cent of motorists believe the government should be doing more to make ‘ green ’ cars more affordable none near me : 80 per cent of drivers surveyed said there was not a charging point near them , such as the one being used by this @entity34 i3 some 89 per cent would like their vehicle to be more environmentally friendly - but only if it did not cost any extra			1
when it comes to powering electric cars , 80 per cent say they have not seen a charging point within five miles of their home and 73 per cent want more charging points			1
and 73 per cent said national tv campaigns would help spread the word about alternative - power vehicles , while 52 per cent said they should be a compulsory section in the driving theory test			0
auto trader group marketing director @entity74 said : ' the good news for car manufacturers is @entity9 motorists are taking an interest in electric vehicles - when made aware of the benefits and cost savings			1
however , we 're still a long way from convincing motorists to make the switch			0
' put simply , going green is not currently an attractive package			0
@entity9 motorists are being asked to make huge compromises on aesthetics and the investment of their time finding and charging their vehicle			2
' it 's no wonder why , on top of all of these factors , a higher upfront purchase price is too much of an ask			0
’ despite a £ 400million investment and a further £ 500million on its way in 2015 from the government , motorists are still lacking information on costs , efficiency and effectiveness of owning electric vehicles - and , simply , choice			2
' clearly not enough is being done to incentivise both manufacturers and consumers			0
