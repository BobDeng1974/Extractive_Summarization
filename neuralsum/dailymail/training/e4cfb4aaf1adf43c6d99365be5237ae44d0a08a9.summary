@entity0 was chief of the @entity2 bridal schools and trained women to become ' perfect ' wives to @entity6 men a sinister set of rules for would - be wives of @entity10 in the @entity2 has been discovered three quarters of a century later			1
several ‘ bride schools ’ were set up with the aim of providing the perfect partners for @entity15 ’s henchmen			1
regulations dictated that young women would be taught ‘ washing , cooking , childcare and home design ’ before they could walk up the aisle with the men who would staff death camps and rule conquered lands with an iron fist			1
they were also instructed in social niceties – such as how to hold conversations at cocktail parties – and how to bring up their children worshipping not @entity33 or @entity34 , but @entity15			0
‘ this is participation in the resurrection path of our people , ’ said @entity0 , chief of the @entity2 bride schools which began 75 years ago when the first was established on the island of @entity39 in the @entity41 lake outside of @entity42			1
along with the rulebook found in the @entity48 were certificates adorned with the @entity50 ’ which were presented to young girls who passed the six - week course to marry their sweethearts in the @entity6 , @entity15 ’s paramilitary defence force			1

women must be the spiritual caregivers and the secret queens of our people , called upon by fate for this special task ! ’ but the doctrine of the bridal schools began to falter the bigger the toll the war took on the home front			2
with slave labour imports still not enough to plug the manpower gap left by men sent to fight hitler ’s war , @entity56 had to dream up a new ideal of womanhood – one less involved with babies and more about turning lathes and operating steel furnaces to turn out the material needed for the fighting man			0
role model : @entity15 's depute @entity123 , with his wife @entity124 and child @entity56 was the highest ranking female nazi in the history of the @entity2			2
