by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 03:40 est , 12 march 2013 ten years of lies and betrayal came to a dramatic conclusion last night when @entity4 was finally put behind bars			2
the former cabinet minister ’s spectacular fall was complete when a prison guard led him in handcuffs to start an eight - month sentence			1
the prosecution said the 58 - year - old millionaire had tried to cheat justice with a ‘ scandalous ’ legal defence			1
@entity15 , who @entity4 persuaded to take his speeding points and later divorced , was also given eight months for the same offence of perverting the course of justice			1
last taste of freedom : @entity4 leaves his @entity23 home and heads to court yesterday with his lover @entity26			2
he was given eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice describing her as ‘ controlling , manipulative and devious ’ , mr @entity29 highlighted her revenge campaign that ruined her cheating husband ’s career			1
he told the pair : ‘ any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault			2
’ addressing @entity4 , he said : ‘ you have fallen from a great height albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place			0
’ the former @entity48 mp , who once harboured hopes of taking deputy prime minister @entity51 ’s job , had lied ‘ again and again ’ in what was a ‘ flagrant offence ’ of its type , he @entity47 ’s barrister said the catastrophe had torn his family apart			0
‘ he is a man laid bare , ’ said @entity57			0
‘ he has two things left to which he can sensibly hope to cling			0
the support of his partner and loyal friends and the hope of a reconciliation with his children			0
’ the end : former energy secretary @entity4 arrives at @entity67 yesterday to be sentenced for perverting the course of justice he insisted however the politician was no bully and had not tried to impose his will on his family			1
once a powerhouse couple – a senior politician and a leading economist – @entity4 and @entity15 looked more like strangers on a bus when in the dock yesterday			1
their eyes failed to meet and they did not exchange a word			0
they sat 4ft from each other			0
the case was conducted at huge public expense and @entity4 is estimated to have spent up to £ 500,000 on his defence			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity87 is trying to recoup £ 117,558 in prosecution costs , £ 79,015 for @entity4 and £ 38,544 for @entity15 , plus an extra £ 31,000 from @entity4 for a previous attempt to get the case thrown out			1
he is fighting the costs order			0
mr @entity92 said @entity4 will pay costs that are ‘ just and reasonable ’ but questioned the prosecutions version of how events unfolded			0
‘ mr @entity4 would not for a moment cave at paying just and reasonable costs attributed to him for this case , ’ he said			0
‘ he would not want to be in any sense a burden on the public purse , bearing in mind his defence			1
’ despite the dubious record of becoming the first former cabinet minister since @entity107 to be jailed , @entity4 has already launched a pr initiative apparently aimed at limiting damage to his image			2
in interviews hours before he was sentenced at @entity23 ’s @entity67 he said he regretted not owning up earlier and accepted the judge ’s conclusion that he ‘ lied and lied again ’			2
he agreed his political career was ‘ very clearly over ’			0
in another interview , he maintained that jail was ‘ a fairly small bit of the total penalty ’ but admitted ‘ lawmakers can be many things , but they can not be lawbreakers ’			0
dubious honour : @entity4 becomes the first former cabinet minister since @entity107 to be jailed remarkably , he said he had hoped @entity15 – described in court as fragile and a broken woman – would be acquitted instead of convicted at her jury trial			1
‘ i did n’t want her to go to jail , ’ he said			0
‘ i told the kids and everybody else that			0
it does worse things to you than to the person you are attempting to attack			0
’ the case came to a close just one day short of ten years from the moment a speed camera caught @entity4 ’s @entity136 doing 19mph above a 50mph limit on the @entity138 between @entity23 and @entity139			0
it might have begun with a simple motoring offence but it led to a desperately risky and ill - founded attempt to weasel out of a driving ban , compounded by lies , complex legal wrangling and an arrogant belief by both @entity4 and @entity15 that they would get away with it			1
@entity4 comes into contact with a photographer 's lens as he arrives at court			0
he tried to avoid a driving ban by falsely claiming his ex-wife was driving his car more than a decade ago what @entity4 might not have bargained for was the vengeful determination of a woman scorned – @entity15 ’s repeated attempts to expose her philandering husband by spilling details to the press of his criminal secret over the speeding fine			1
nor , perhaps , did he imagine he would be ‘ laid bare ’ in a case that went ahead against his spurned wife for her part in the deception after he finally pleaded guilty , and she did n’t			2
yesterday he made a public apology in court claiming he ‘ felt awful ’ about dragging people he loved into what he described as ‘ this gruelling experience ’			0
in legal mitigation it was clear that @entity4 did not want to say anything derogatory about his ex-wife			2
perhaps significantly , the sole allegation he did reject was a claim from her that he forced her to abort one of their children , part of the evidence she gave from the witness stand			0
court artist sketch of @entity4 and @entity15 being sentenced at @entity67 in @entity23 yesterday both defendants wore black as they stepped separately into the dock			1
@entity15 had a red rose in her bag from an admirer outside court , plus a double pack of tissues			1
@entity4 read from papers given to him by his legal team			2
their 26 - year marriage ended more than two years ago after the exposure of his affair with @entity26 , his 47 - year - old pr adviser			2
the tall brunette sat a few feet from the dock alongside @entity4 ’s father @entity202 , visible to her lover but out of sight of @entity15			1
sentencing the pair , mr @entity29 said : ‘ to the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process , it is that now , finally , you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence			0
rose for a prisoner : @entity15 gets a rose from an elderly well - wisher on her way into court for sentence yesterday ‘ any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault			1
’ the judge said @entity4 had lied to avoid prosecution for the offence – then compounded those lies by insisting @entity15 had not taken the points for him , pleading not guilty , and by trying to get the case thrown out under abuse of process			1
‘ whereas the truth , as you well knew throughout , was that @entity15 had taken the points for you and you were guilty , ’ the judge said			1
both @entity15 and @entity4 are expected to be released from prison after only two months with a tag and a strict curfew .			1

decade - long saga ends as *disgraced* politician is jailed for eight months
his former wife @entity15 gets the same sentence
judge says legal defence was ' scandalous '
