by @entity0 the first planets outside the solar system were confirmed in 1992 , uninhabitable worlds around a pulsar 1,000 light years away			1
over the next 17 years the discoveries of more and more planets started to trickle in			0
but in 2009 , with the launch of @entity12 ’s @entity11 telescope , the number of confirmed planets shot up from several hundred to over a thousand – and with it our chances of finding a new @entity16 have dramatically increased			1
this @entity12 graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically increased since the launch of @entity11 in 2009 and its subsequent studies of distant stars to date @entity22 has found 3,845 planetary candidates , 962 of which have been confirmed as planets			1
it was not until last week , however , that astronomers finally found a world they had been trying to find for so long			2
just last week , @entity29 reported that a planet the size of @entity16 had finally been found orbiting in the so - called habitable zone of a star – the holy grail of planet hunting			1
as shown in the graphics on this page , the remarkable amount of planets that are known of is thanks to the @entity11 telescope			1
it was announced last week that the first @entity16 - sized planet in a habitable zone of a distant star had been found			1
with the discovery of this planet , called @entity50 , astronomers are now closer than ever to finding a true @entity16 2.0			1
‘ there could be many of these planets closer by , ’ @entity11 scientist dr @entity51 told @entity29			1
‘ if we can find those and subject them to study , we could see if they have biosignatures in the atmosphere			0
‘ in the next 20 years i ’d say there ’s an 80 per cent chance we ’ll find a definite habitable planet in our vicinity			2
‘ if we look at all those planets we wo n’t see cities or coastlines or green fields , but i think we ’ll have a good shot of seeing water vapour and things that make us believe they ’re more like @entity16			1
’ it found planets by observing 100,000 stars simultaneously and measuring dips in light if a planet passed in front			2
known as the transit method , this has proved wildly successful and revealed a host of planets			0
for a planet to be confirmed , however , three transits must be observed			0
this has meant that most of the planets discovered so far are on much tighter orbits than @entity16 as they complete transits more quickly			2
these worlds are inhospitable to life as we know it , but their discoveries has given us a glimpse into the broad range of planets in the universe			0
for planets more akin to @entity16 , that are in more habitable orbits , it takes longer to observe three transits			2
this is why it has taken until now to confirm planets the size of @entity16 in habitable zones , as these planets could not be confirmed until the third transit had been confirmed			2
as data of repeated transits is studied , more planets in more ' habitable ' orbits will be found			0
the kepler space telescope finds planets using the transit method , which measures the dip in light from stars when a planet passes in front , from which the world 's size and orbit can be deduced @entity22 has found many siginificant planet including @entity127 ( pictured ) , a so - called ' super earth ' twice the size of our planet but in the habitable zone of its star , meaning it could have liquid water on its surface the @entity11 telescope is currently ‘ dead in the water ’ as it has now lost functionality in two of its four reaction wheels			1
these were used to point the telescope accurately at distant stars			0
however , a bold new plan to save the telescope known as the @entity149 mission is currently in the works , @entity12 ’s @entity51 tells @entity29			1
‘ as of may of 2013 , @entity11 lost its second reaction wheel and that left it with only two , ’ he says			0
‘ the way you point the spacecraft very tightly is using reaction wheels in a 3 - axis system			0
‘ once you have only two in particular , most people believe your spacecraft ca n’t be used to point precisely			0
’ ‘ so working with engineers at @entity164 we devised this unique plan where we would point the telescope in its orbital plane			0
‘ laying flat in that direction , we use the @entity171 ’s light shining on the solar panels to provide a balancing force like a third reaction wheel			0
’ @entity12 's kepler space telescope , pictured , has been the most successful planet - hunting observatory to date the discovery of @entity50 , artist 's rendering pictured , was announced last week			1
it is the first @entity16 - sized planet found in the habitable zone of a star , and could signal that there are @entity16 2.0s waiting to be found in @entity11 's data the team have spent the fall trying the new mission proposal out and the spring testing the data acquisition			1
now they know that it works ‘ incredibly well ’ and they have given their proposal to repurpose the telescope to @entity12			2
they are hoping for funding to continue operating the mission for the next two or three years			0
via this method they will be limited to planets in orbits of 40 days or so			0
but they will be observing planets in orbits around stars different to those that were observed in the initial mission			0
namely , the stars will be more like our own sun than those in the original ‘ @entity11 field , ’ which was mainly stars dimmer than our sun known as m - type stars such as red dwarfs			2
this new mission will give astronomers further information on how common planets are around stars like our sun. and ultimately , considering the huge numbers of planets found by the observatory so far , it could be yet another feather in the cap of this famous planet hunting telescope .			1

@entity12 's planet - hunting kepler space telescope was launched in 2009
to date it has found nearly *4,000* *potential* planets outside the solar system
its primary goal has been to find a true @entity16 2.0 , and it is getting closer
before @entity11 we knew of only a *handful* of so - called *exoplanets*
now the telescope is ' dead in the water ' as its positioning system has failed
but a @entity12 scientist has revealed a bold new plan to save the mission
