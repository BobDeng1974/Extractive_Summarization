@entity0 looks more ' mr @entity1 ' than ex-government head as he channels his inner @entity3 in @entity4 yesterday			2
the former @entity6 prime minister went for an afternoon stroll through @entity8 flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film @entity11			1
wearing a dark suit and white shirt , he strode the sidewalk with purpose , protected on all sides by a detail of hired muscle			0
but the casual observer could have been forgiven for assuming it was a bizarre re-enactment of the opening credits of @entity3 's acclaimed 1992 crime caper - starring @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity25 - where the protagonists walk towards the camera each wearing black suits			1
mr @entity1 , i presume ? the former @entity6 prime minister went for an afternoon stroll through @entity8 flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film @entity11 likeness ? but the casual observer could have been forgiven for assuming it was a bizarre re-enactment of the opening credits of @entity3 's acclaimed 1992 crime caper starring @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity25 muscle : wearing a dark suit and white shirt , he strode the sidewalk with purpose , protected on all sides by a detail of hired muscle he was in @entity8 to receive an honour from humanitarian charity @entity50 at a star - studded ceremony in the city			1
mr @entity0 , who set @entity6 on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of its national income on overseas aid , was given the @entity57 in recognition of his leadership in international development			1
award : he was in @entity8 to receive an honour from humanitarian charity @entity50 at a star - studded ceremony in the city ( left )			1
pictured right : ‘ mr @entity1 ’ in a past life with mr @entity68 there , mr @entity0 hobnobbed with @entity71 stars as guest of honour at the ceremony			0
even the latest incarnation of @entity76 the dog was among the guests , along with actor and director @entity80 , his wife @entity81 and actress @entity81			0
as prime minister , mr @entity0 set up the @entity84 and hosted a series of aid summits			2
critics say @entity6 ’s foreign aid budget – which hit £ 11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes , including spending millions in countries such as @entity92 which can afford its own space programme			2
looking sharp : mr @entity0 rubbed shoulders with @entity71 royalty including @entity80 and @entity81 as guest of honour at the star - studded event hero dog : @entity76 , or rather her latest incarnation , was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event accepting his award last night , mr @entity0 said : ‘ from the beginning of humankind there has been brutality , conflict , intrigue , the destructive obsession with a narrow self - interest			2
but throughout all human history , never has been extinguished that relentless , unquenchable desire to do good			0
to act not only in self - interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it			0
’ a spokesman for @entity57 said : ‘ the @entity6 ’s achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [ mr @entity0 ’s ] leadership			1
’ but @entity123 , conservative mp for @entity124 , said : ‘ i am not sure that giving overseas aid to @entity126 and @entity92 and setting us on the path to the biggest crash in a century is anything to celebrate			0
’ @entity132 , @entity133 mp for @entity134 , said : ‘ this award is undeserved and frankly i think most @entity6 people will find it totally inappropriate that someone who has left the country bankrupt is honoured in this way			0

@entity0 was in @entity8 to receive humanitarian award at *glitzy* bash
but he looked more like a cast *member* of 1992 crime film @entity11
@entity0 's work on debt relief and foreign aid was hailed by @entity57
