of all the players @entity2 wanted to avoid losing at this critical point in the season , @entity0 was perhaps top of his list			1
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 would all be missed , of course , but @entity0 dictates how @entity12 plays			1
his prowling presence , tackling strength and defensive acumen in midfield offers more freedom to the creative players , especially @entity19 in his deeper role			0
this studs - up tackle from @entity22 infuriated @entity0 and @entity2 backed up his player @entity0 's reaction to @entity22 's tackle earned the @entity25 a red card - he 'll now miss the @entity28 final ' two points dropped at home to relegation threatened @entity32 and midfield keystone @entity0 banned for three games and , surprise , surprise , it is all down to the decisions which went against @entity12 ' click here to read @entity40 's match report from @entity41 of 37 games featuring @entity0 this season @entity12 have lost only one - at @entity43			1
of the three he missed they have lost two - against @entity45 and @entity46			2
the flashpoint between him and @entity32 's @entity22 â€“ the bad tackle missed by officials , the reaction and the red card for violent conduct - may yet prove to be a moment of title race significance to match the meltdown at @entity55 last march			1
' the man is a giant , not for his size but the way he plays , ' said @entity2 of @entity0 , after winning at @entity60 in november			1
@entity12 were undecided about whether to appeal the red card on sunday night			2
they have the right to , in which case it will go before an independent commission to decide if @entity65 made the right call			0
referee @entity65 shows @entity0 a straight red card after his altercation with @entity22 in the second half @entity0 is sent off by @entity65 after reacting angrily to a horrid tackle on saturday at @entity41 it is hard to imagine the commission overturning it as @entity0 's reaction fell firmly into the category of violent conduct regardless of the provocation and precisely where he put his hands - but they have been known to make some strange decisions and @entity2 might consider it worth a try			1
without him , @entity12 have to adjust the balance			2
making it worse , @entity83 is out with a knee injury and not close to a return			2
' no chance , ' said @entity2 was asked if @entity0 's most obvious replacement might be rushed back for the @entity28 final against @entity43 at @entity90 , on sunday			1
asked who might play , he replied : ' somebody will			0
' with @entity83 sitting as he does in front of the centre - halves , @entity12 could flank him with @entity96 and @entity8 and switch to a 4 - 3 - 3 shape			1
@entity0 ( left ) , pictured alongside @entity98 , will be a big miss when @entity12 face @entity43 on sunday @entity83 would have been a potential replacement for @entity0 , but is sidelined with a knee injury without him , @entity2 's options revolve around @entity103 , a 20 - year - old defensive midfielder who has started only twice this season , and @entity96 , who is clearly at his best when galloping freely rather than sitting and reading the game			1
neither can boast the height of @entity0 or @entity83			1
@entity96 was easily beaten in the air at a corner by @entity111 for @entity32 's late equaliser at @entity41 on saturday			1
the corner came when @entity114 pushed a shot wide from @entity22 , who was allowed to twist and aim at goal from that edge - of - the - box area usually patrolled by @entity0			1
it is in these pockets of space between the holding midfielders and the centre - halves that @entity43 's best players @entity98 and @entity124 seek to do their damage			2
on @entity2 's side , is the fact he has time to plan			2
@entity111 rises above @entity96 to equalise for @entity32 on saturday , making the score 1 - 1 @entity12 goalkeeper @entity114 can only watch in vain as @entity131 's header beats the @entity133 international @entity12 have the entire week free while @entity43 are flying to @entity134 to play @entity135 on thursday in the second leg of the @entity138 last - 32 tie which is poised at 1 - 1			1
@entity2 likes to plot as he did when he won with a weakened team at @entity60 in april , although both @entity0 and @entity83 played that day and he had given up on winning the @entity140			1
this season , he is determined to win it and these next three games are vital			2
first , the @entity28 final , with @entity2 searching for the first trophy since his return , but lose at @entity90 and the worm of doubt will eat away on a day when @entity149 will cut the gap at the top to two points if they win at @entity60			1
after that , @entity12 travel across the capital for a @entity156 derby with @entity157 and a home fixture against gravity - defying @entity159 , two games which promise intense and physical midfield contests			2
@entity114 , pictured smashing the bar in frustration after @entity32 's equaliser , admits @entity0 will be missed @entity165 was honest in his assessment of the game , claiming that @entity12 should have won the match ' @entity0 will be missed , ' admitted goalkeeper @entity114			1
' he has been very good for us this season			2
it is a pity but heads - up we must continue			0
we have other players who can do the job also and they are strong players			0
' @entity114 thought the sending off changed the game on saturday but , unlike their manager , the @entity12 players did not try to avoid blame for dropping points at home for only the second time this season			2
' we should have won the game , ' said full - back @entity165			0
' i do n't believe in luck and do n't want to talk about the referee			0
we can not allow these things to happen			0
we can not lose points at home			0
' we played really well			0
we had a lot of chances			0
we were solid in defence and everyone was running in attack			0
but it is not easy			0
we are top of the league and everyone is trying to steal points from us			0
@entity65 , the referee for @entity12 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity32 , was criticised by @entity2 for his decisions @entity202 of @entity32 ( right ) said that it was a massive point for his side against @entity12 on saturday ' we have to say @entity32 did a good job			1
they have won points against @entity149 and @entity208			0
they are a good team			0
' @entity210 said @entity165 , because this point was in danger of being lost amid @entity2 's storm of numbers and silent accusations about @entity22 and referee @entity65			1
@entity32 did play well , even before the sending off			0
they have only won four this season but are eking out points and fighting for survival			0
' it was a massive point after going down against one of the best teams in the world , ' said defender @entity223 .			0
