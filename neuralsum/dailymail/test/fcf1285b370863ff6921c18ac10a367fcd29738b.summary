given the choice between ' average ' and ' beautiful ' , which description would you choose for yourself ? that is the question that has been posed to women by @entity5 in a new survey , and the results are shocking			1
in @entity9 , 83 per cent of women rate themselves as average looking , the study found , while around the world just four per cent think they 're worthy of the glowing epithet			1
while the statistics speak volumes about @entity9 women 's perceptions of themselves , they appear more confident than the global average			1
a staggering 96 per cent of women around the world describe themselves as average , leaving just four per cent to admit they consider themselves beautiful			1
the beauty brand highlighted the survey results with a new video , released this week , that shows women being faced with the choice of telling the world they see themselves as beautiful or average			1
@entity5 erected signs above doors to public buildings in five cities - @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 - and filmed women 's actions when faced with having to walk through one or the other			1
the vast majority of participants chose to walk through the ' average ' door , corresponding closely with the survey results			1
on film : the statistics are highlighted in a new video by @entity5 which shows women having to walk through doors , either marked beautiful or average worldwide : the film was shot in five cities , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 @entity5 says that feeling beautiful is a personal choice that women should feel empowered to make for themselves every day			1
however , many found that when they had to behave in a way that revealed their image of themselves to the world - they balked			0
many said afterwards that they regretted their decision , and that it had affected how they felt about themselves			0
one woman confessed : ' it was confronting to see these signs , and to have to choose , and be self - conscious of how you perceive yourself and if it lines up with how the rest of the world perceives you			2
are you beautiful ? the global statistic was higher , with a staggering 96 per cent of worldwide respondents answering ' average ' choices : like the survey results , the overwhelming majority of women chose to walk through the doors marked ' average ' @entity92 : ' beautiful , to me , is too far out of reach , ' said one participant who chose the average door another said : ' it was my choice , and now i will question myself for the next few weeks , maybe months			1
' a @entity101 woman , laughing modestly , said : ' i went through the average door			2
i did n't even hesitate			0
' while a @entity104 participant , who chose ' average ' admitted : ' i regretted my choice because it was different to what i live for and what i live			2
' a woman in @entity111 also said she wished she 'd chosen differently , saying : ' i had rated myself as average and nobody else			2
' an @entity115 participant added : ' am i choosing because of what is constantly bombarded at me and what i 'm being told that i should accept ? or am i choosing because that 's what i really believe ? ' in @entity47 , a woman picked the average door , saying : ' beautiful , to me , is too far out of reach			2
' the video is part of @entity5 's # @entity126 campaign , which aims to ' encourage women worldwide to reconsider the choices they make about their beauty and how those choices make them feel			1
' these women are confident about their looks , but many women who chose ' average ' said they regretted it these schoolgirls take part in @entity5 's experiment and appear to be leaning towards the ' beautiful ' door choose beautiful : the campaign aims to ' encourage women worldwide to reconsider the choices they make about their beauty and how those choices make them feel ' the company 's marketing director @entity145 said : ' @entity147 urges women to embrace this personal choice , because when we do , it unlocks happiness and confidence that impacts women 's self - esteem			1
women watching the campaign took to social media to express sadness that so many people felt the need to put themselves down			2
@entity162 , from @entity49 , tweeted : ' women we need to value ourselves more			0
2 doors - average & beautiful			1
' women took to @entity168 to lament females ' lack of confidence in their appearance around the world @entity162 from @entity49 exhorted women to value themselves more @entity175 was here said that feeling beautiful is a decision every woman should make for herself @entity178 , from @entity49 , posted on @entity168 : ' i decided to # choosebeautiful because if i do n't think it myself , no one else will			1
' a user called @ @entity183 , in @entity184 , tweeted : ' knowing that it 's your decision to feel beautiful is so powerful			0
once you realize that , no one can make you feel otherwise # @entity126			1
' the latest video comes close on the heels of another ad created in @entity192 as part of its # @entity195 campaign			1
the clip was designed to highlight how many women put themselves down or fall prey to a critical inner voice			0
skincare and beauty line dove has long championed ' real ' beauty , photographing everyday women rather than professional models for its advertisements			2
@entity5 asked a group of women in @entity192 - all beautiful and impeccably chic - to write down every thought they had about themselves in a notebook			1
the beauty brand then took the notes away with them and unbeknownst to the women , those criticisms , negative remarks and tirades of self body - shaming were turned into a script			0
then two actresses , read the script out loud as dialogue in a cafe , where the women themselves had been invited for coffee			0
in the experiment the women had to hear the actresses repeat their own thoughts to each other , out loud			0
one woman hears her judgment on herself that her belly has the potential to look too big in the @entity5 ad the comments were so cutting that a customer at a nearby table , who was n't involved in the experiment , even intervened			2
an actress read out a remark written by one woman who appears very slim : ' your arms are too big , your silhouette is all squashed			0
' she continues : ' sit up straight otherwise your belly looks big			0
' several of the women 's messages to themselves echoed bullying , that if came from someone else , would be immediately frowned upon			0
' with your little baby teeth you look like a mouse , ' said one			0
while another read , ' your face looks like a bulldog			0
' when said out loud , the comments underline the way many women effectively bully themselves every single day			0
visibly shocked by the comments , the women recognised the dialogue as their own notes			0
' i hope my daughter never speaks to herself like that , ' says one			0
while another concedes , ' yes that 's what i say to myself all day long			0
now , i get how violent it is ! ' @entity273 campaign is another of @entity5 's efforts to champion ' real ' beauty .			1
