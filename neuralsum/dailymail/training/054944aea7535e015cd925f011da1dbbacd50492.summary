appropriately it was a man called @entity2 who put a little distance between @entity4 and the relegation zone here			1
whether he should have had the chance to save their day is a question that no doubt ran laps in @entity14 ’s mind			2
once again , a game featuring @entity16 came down to a couple of contentious refereeing calls , including one to award a penalty against @entity20 for a challenge on @entity22 and a later decision to let the striker stay on the pitch			1
scorer : @entity32 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity39 6 ; @entity60 , @entity61 6 , hangeland 5.5 , @entity62 5 ; @entity63 6 ( @entity64 81 ) , @entity65 7 , @entity66 6.5 , @entity67 6 ; @entity22 5 ( @entity68 65 , 6 ) , @entity69 6 ( @entity70 21 , 6.5 )			1
subs not used : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			2
scorer : jedinak 25 ( pen ) booked : @entity22 , @entity70 @entity78 : @entity36 referee : @entity80 - 5 att : 20,240 the penalty certainly looked soft , but @entity80 pointed to the spot and @entity65 converted for a 25th - minute equaliser which , until that stage , had been nowhere in sight			1
credit to @entity4 for finding a way back without the use of satellite navigation , but @entity90 would have had cause to debate the central decision , even if he did tread more cautiously after the furore around his recent complaints about referees			1
‘ it is difficult because the footage i have seen is pretty inconclusive , ’ @entity14 said			2
‘ the referee gave the action that his legs have been taken away from him			2
' the footage i have seen ( shows ) there is no leg contact between the two players			0
it is more of an upper body			0
‘ i ’m not too sure but it is inconclusive			0
he has given it and we have to deal with it			0
’ perhaps more contentious were the calls that let @entity22 stay on the pitch			1
he was booked for a foul on @entity47 and followed it by shouting at @entity80			1
there was also a handball on the edge of his area and a petulant early throw of the ball after a decision			0
asked if he was lucky to stay on , @entity14 said : ‘ possibly , but that is not my focus			0
i do n’t focus on the other team			0
i focus on my team			0
’ in which case , he has some work to do when it comes to holding on to leads in games			0
@entity51 ( right ) continued his impressive form and gave @entity137 a tough game @entity4 appeal for a penalty after @entity20 ( centre ) challenged @entity22 ( left ) for the ball in the penalty area palace captain @entity65 levelled 10 minutes after @entity27 's goal from the penalty spot @entity65 ( second right ) celebrates scoring a penalty alongside his team - mates in the game on saturday at the @entity149 @entity150 miles @entity16 105.9 65.8 @entity36 90 11.5 7.2 @entity44 90 11.2 7.0 @entity151 90 11.2 6.9 @entity4 109.2 67.9 @entity66 90 10.8 6.7 @entity41 90 10.7 6.6 @entity65 90 10.6 6.6 having led through @entity27 ’s goal after 15 minutes , by which point @entity16 had already missed two good chances in a dominant opening , the home side made it 13 points dropped from winning positions this season			1
but it would be unfair to draw too much attention away from @entity164 ’s side			0
whatever the merits of the penalty decision — @entity164 thought it was a good call — they bounced back remarkably well from a terrible start and should have led after @entity65 ’s equaliser , when @entity22 went clean through and shot straight at @entity171			1
@entity164 said : ‘ the first 20 minutes were as bad as i ’ve seen us play since i ’ve been at the club			1
' we could n’t pass water			0
i thought it would be double figures after 15 minutes			2
‘ i saw @entity16 batter @entity179 a couple of weeks ago so i knew how difficult it was going to be			1
' @entity16 always control the game			1
that ’s how they are			0
but you have to give us credit as a lot of teams could have laid down			0
‘ we had a great chance at 1 - 1 with @entity22 ’s chance and i went positive at the end and i thought we could pinch it			2
' we might be limited in certain areas but we are an honest group			0
’ @entity49 ( left ) tries to get past @entity62 ( right ) as @entity16 were held to a 1 - 1 draw at home by @entity4 jedinak shoots but was unable to give @entity164 's side all three points against @entity16 palace manager @entity164 ( right ) looks on as @entity22 ( second left ) is booked by referee @entity80 ( left ) @entity67 ( left ) of @entity4 takes on @entity45 ( right ) of @entity16 in the 1 - 1 draw in the @entity35 on saturday @entity45 ( left ) helps @entity67 ( right ) back to his feet after the two tumbled over in the match at the @entity149 @entity16 manager @entity14 ( left ) talks to his opposite number @entity164 ( right ) during the match between their two teams			1

@entity27 fired @entity16 into the lead with a tremendous strike in the 15th minute
@entity65 *hauled* @entity4 level against the run of play with a penalty ten minutes later
the penalty , awarded by @entity80 for a challenge by @entity20 on @entity22 , seemed soft
@entity16 pushed for a winner in the second half but were unable to seize all three points
