by @entity0 published : 10:10 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 10:10 est , 23 june 2013 her videos about sex , relationships , love , gender , life see viewers flock to her @entity10 channel in their thousands			0
as well as having enjoying @entity13 's tongue - in - cheek views fans get to relish a new ' pretend boyfriend ' each week			1
so as this week 's offering about why men love women sees ex-athlete and tv presenter @entity19 , 28 , take the form of boyfriend , the video has unsurprisingly spurred almost 20,000 views			1
' @entity19 is also a presenter and a really good actor so was a perfect pretend boyfriend			1
also he 's good looking which always helps , ' said @entity13			1
to illustrate her point with a sketch , she comes home from work and dismisses @entity19 's greeting instead opting to cuddle up to his crotch			1
' i 've missed you , ' she says			0
her second reason is , bizarrely , that you ca n't get angry at men when they borrow your clothes			0
viewers are treated to a scene in which @entity13 walks in on @entity19 wears a pretty blue dress while watching the television			1
her surreal scenes are intended for some ' much needed light entertainment ' , as her disclaimer reads			0
' you might not agree with everything i say and that 's fine , ' she says			2
reason three is when a man smells good ' it is so intoxicating '			0
' sometimes if i walk past a guy on the street , who does n't even have to be that attractive , if he smells good - that is me turned on , ' she says			0
' i call myself fairly independent , and i 'm not the kind of girl to to rely on a man , ' she says , but adds that she finds it sweet when a man tries to protect her and her out of harm 's way			0
you ca n't get angry when they borrow clothes : a bulky @entity19 sits open legged with a beer in hand they want to protect you : any leaps to @entity13 's rescue from a spider , even though she is independent men are laid back : unlike highly strung @entity13 who shouts at @entity19 when he offers her a cup of tea @entity19 is seen shouting at her to get down and leaping to her rescue when she asks him to ' get that spider '			1
@entity13 next points to men ' take it or leave it approach to life			2
' women can sometimes be highly strung and overreact , ' says @entity13			2
she also loves it when ' you talk about how much you love your sisters or you mum in front of us - it really works , ' she says			0
reason seven is that ' men remind us of our dads , ' says @entity13			2
she quickly backtracks , looking around and saying , ' who said that ? ' ' there 's something endearing about men having the ability to solve any problem just by throwing a ball , ' she says			0
this is illustrated with a sketch of @entity13 complaining about their being nothing on tv and a ball being thrown at her			1
next we see @entity13 walking down the street in a modest buttoned - up shirt when @entity19 approaches her to compliment her on her ' great rack '			1
she appreciates his comment and states reason nine that women love men being that they are ' enthusiastic about bodies , even if we sometimes are not '			0
finally , her tenth reason is that women love it when men show their emotions			0
' if a guy cries in front of you , as a woman you have just won the emotional lottery , ' she says , as we see her initiate sex inappropriately as @entity19 cries over a deceased loved one			2
watch the full length video on @entity13 's @entity10 channel			1
she recently did a blind date for ok ! magazine and presents @entity145 for @entity146			0
men solve problems by throwing balls at them : @entity13 finds this quality endearing men appreciate our bodies : on a day when @entity13 is n't feeling great about her ' rack ' @entity19 compliments her when they show their emotional side : @entity13 gets overexcited and initiates sex as @entity19 mourns a loved one			1
