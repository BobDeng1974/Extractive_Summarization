@entity0 faces @entity1 for the first time since leaving the @entity3 this weekend as @entity4 host the @entity5 at @entity6			1
we asked @entity1 fan site @entity8 just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them , especially since he 's been playing so well			1
if you wanted a symbol of the divide among @entity1 supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than @entity0			1
there is an on - going debate , both within the @entity3 and on the numerous websites devoted to the club , about @entity25 and his continued tenure and @entity28 ’s sale of @entity0 to @entity4 has rubbed salt into those wounds			1
for many of us , @entity0 epitomised the great things @entity25 achieved over so many years			2
he was the lingering ember , still smouldering in @entity28 , that so many @entity1 fans believed could re-ignite @entity25 's reign and breathe quality back into a central midfield that had become dull			1
@entity0 ( right ) will line up for @entity39 's high - flying @entity4 against @entity1 this weekend @entity0 has been the driving force behind @entity4 's improved creativity and goal scoring this season he never spoke badly of the club , even after forcing the move that hurt so many of us			1
i could see why he wanted to go at the time , though			0
@entity28 had exerted a strong pull under @entity48 and it was @entity0 's homeland			0
all the rumours about him refusing to play for us in pre-season and feigning injury were disturbing for sure but fans ’ forgiveness tends to be in proportion to the player 's quality and nobody could dispute @entity0 had that in abundance			0
after the @entity64 success the word was that @entity25 would push the boat out in the summer and sign the players that just about everybody in football knew we needed			0
so , when it became clear that the golden boy was available and @entity1 had a clause in his contract of sale that gave the club the right of first refusal , at a discount price , then what was the problem ? sign him , @entity25			2
the problem was that our manager did n't see it that way at all			0
@entity25 played a key role in shaping @entity0 at @entity1 into the talented player you see today @entity0 became club captain at @entity1 and is pictured here celebrating a goal with @entity92 after several attempts @entity0 finally left @entity1 to return his boyhood club @entity28 in summer 2011 now , whether this was for purely footballing reasons in that he did n't want to inhibit the growth of @entity99 and @entity100 or , as @entity0 has said , because of the presence of @entity102			1
or was it a bit of rather ill - judged payback for some shoddy behaviour against the man who had made him the great player he undoubtedly is ? but the awful fact of the matter is that @entity1 said no and took a percentage of the transfer fee to , of all clubs , @entity4			2
@entity0 is showing the midfield creativity at @entity4 that @entity1 would have benefited from this season will @entity25 's decision not to resign @entity115 come back to haunt @entity1 at @entity6 this weekend ? those of us who have watched @entity39 's team through gritted teeth this season could n't have failed to have noticed that he is doing rather well for them			1
in fact , he puts the opposition under pressure just about every time he gets the ball in their half			0
unfortunately for us and in my opinion , @entity0 was exactly the player we needed and as @entity25 seems to see @entity102 as a left - winger i really ca n't see the sense in not signing him			2
the sudden drop in @entity100 's form and his subsequent two - month injury , plus the inconsistent nature of @entity99 's game has made the decision look worse and worse with each passing day			0
but , not to sign him and at the same time strengthening @entity139 opponents , @entity4 ? crazy and for some of us , painful too			0
@entity142 on @entity143 @ @entity144			0

@entity0 faces @entity1 for the first time since leaving the @entity3
the @entity148 signed for @entity4 in a *£* *30m* deal in the summer
@entity25 decided against taking up *option* to bring @entity0 back
@entity0 has started the season in top form for @entity39
@entity1 fan site @entity8 believes @entity25 was *wrong* to pass up chance to resign @entity0 and that seeing him star for @entity4 is painful
