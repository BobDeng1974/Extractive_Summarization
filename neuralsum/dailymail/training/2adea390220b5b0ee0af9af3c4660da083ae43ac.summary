the 3,500 - year - old limestone figurine of ' a daughter of the @entity10 ' , has not been found since @entity11 in central @entity1 was completely ransacked and 1,000 precious goods were stolen in august just days after protests were held against president @entity14 in @entity15			1
the ' masterpiece ' was due to be transferred to a new museum but experts believe the riots were used as cover to steal it and now fear the precious piece could be sold on the black market			1
stolen : a statue of @entity6 's sister went missing when the @entity24 was looted in the aftermath of the uprising in @entity15 this summer destroyed : looters ransacked the museum leaving exhibits empty and ruining precious goods looters walked off with everything that could be carried from the museum with only 46 out of 1,089 exhibits remaining when the clashes died down			1
items which were too heavy to carry off were smashed and burned while some wooden sarcophagi simply split open			0
more than 600 pieces have since been returned or seized by police , but hundreds , including a collection of @entity42 gold coins have still not been recovered			2
relics of the @entity10 era , source of the most celebrated finds of ancient @entity1 , fetch the highest prices on the international black market and families of antiquities smugglers are known to operate in the area , the @entity43 reported			1
emptied : around 1,000 precious items were stolen during the riots which lasted for three days @entity55 , an @entity1 archaeologist who has campaigned to protect the country 's heritage , said the looters knew they were taking the ' highlight of the museum '			1
@entity61 , a curator at @entity24 , said : ' we heard what had happened in @entity15 and started to see the gangs gather , ' said			2
then there were big crowds , and they started firing into the air			0
' the staff eventually closed the museum and brought in the tourist police to protect it , but they were attacked and driven off allowing the looting to continue for another three days			0
eventually , the provincial chief of tourist police , col @entity73 , called members of his own family to stand guard while she and colleagues inspected the damage and took what could be salvaged to safe storage			0
she said she asked two teenagers what they were doing			0
' they said , " the government is destroying their people , so we are destroying this because it belongs to the government " , ' she said			0
ancient : some of the items that were stolen are more than 3,500 years old col @entity73 agreed that the looting was organised under the cover of the protests by local criminal gangs			2
he has now alerted @entity99 , the @entity101 cultural organisation , and @entity102 fearing that the remainder of the pieces , including the statuette of @entity10 's daughter , would be taken abroad and sold on the black market			1
@entity10 is celebrated for the unusual style of the many images of him and his wife , @entity110 , and for having founded a new , monotheistic religion worshipping the sun. the pharaoh also founded a new capital at @entity117 , near @entity118 , the finds from which are due to be concentrated on a new museum being built at the provincial capital , @entity121			0
@entity1 's museum service is self - funded from tourist receipts and international collaborations , both of which have collapsed since the 2011 uprising			2
a spokesman for @entity99 said the damaged caused by the looters was ' catastrophic ' and said it was ' working closely ' with the authorities such as @entity102 and the @entity132 to fight the ' illicit traffic of these stolen objects ' .			0
