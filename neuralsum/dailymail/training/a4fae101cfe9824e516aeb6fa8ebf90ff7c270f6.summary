with shoppers queueing from the early hours and millions logging onto the internet to snaffle the best bargains , you could be forgiven for thinking the @entity5 sales have come early			1

and you do n't have to brave the @entity18 — most retailers are offering the same discounts online as in store			1
better still , many discounts will be available over the whole weekend			2
inside this exclusive guide we will tell you how to get incredible bargains , teach you how shop safely online , and reveal the celebrities ' best sale buys			1
@entity10 sales began as an @entity30 tradition , in which shoppers would race to snap up bargains on the first friday after the @entity34 holiday			1
the name was coined by @entity37 police in the @entity38 after hordes of rampant shoppers caused havoc			0
and then in 2010 online store @entity48 introduced @entity7 @entity10 sales			1
@entity18 retailers quickly followed suit , and over the past two years sales have soared			1
indeed , credit card company @entity52 predicts spending in the @entity7 will be up 22 per cent on last year , with £ 1 million spent on its cards every three minutes today			1
shoppers will be thinking about @entity58 presents , and there should be plenty to choose from			0
@entity61 , which opens its flagship @entity64 store an hour early , has pledged to price - match discounts from competitors , as will @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
supermarkets are also offering lots of bargains , but you 'll have to be quick to snap up the best ones — @entity77 's will start its sale at 1am in its 24 - hour stores , while many @entity67 branches will open at one minute past midnight			1
@entity81 , whose sales are due to start at 8am , has 700,000 @entity10 products on offer in 441 stores			1
there were fights among customers last year when @entity81 led the adoption of the @entity30 tradition and the firm is extending its sale to two days this year			0
retailers including @entity61 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are promising deals of up to 70 per cent off			2
some 700,000 products are being offered at knock down prices , including a 40 - inch tv for £ 139 and an @entity103 tablet for just £ 29			1
@entity61 is offering a @entity105 coffee machine for half price at £ 595 , while @entity95 is launching a four - day sale with savings of up to 30 per cent			1
@entity97 is selling women ’s designer dresses at half price			2
while @entity67 – which is slashing prices by up to 70 per cent – opened its branches at a minute past midnight to catch early bird shoppers			2
but even if you miss deals this weekend , do n't worry — on monday retailers launch more online discounts for ' cyber monday ' , traditionally the year 's biggest internet shopping day			1
we 've got plenty of ideas in this pull - out for that day , too			1
for many retailers this weekend signals the start of a sale season which will go on through to january			2
all you need to do to take advantage of the next few days of deals is dust off your credit card , turn the page and get started			0
happy shopping ! bag a @entity10 bargain : supermarkets look what you can buy on @entity136 1			1
is the @entity137 ? it should include the retailer ’s name , address and email address			0
check for a tiny padlock or unbroken key symbol before the web address , and be sure the address begins with https : / / ( the ‘ s ’ is for ‘ secure ’ )			0
genuine firms wo n’t feature the names of popular items or cheap prices in their web address			2
@entity154 if you ’ve spotted a gift from a relatively unknown company , @entity158 it and see what comes up			0
when browsing for goods , do n’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results			0
@entity164 for goods costing £ 100 - plus , a credit card gives more protection than a debit card , prepaid card or @entity170			2
if an order goes astray , the goods break or the firm goes bust , you can claim from the card provider			0
never pay by cash transfer			0
@entity178 £ 50 on anti-virus protection from ‘ phishing ’ emails to spyware , fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts , so get an up - to - date firewall from the likes of @entity187 or @entity188 for £ 20 to £ 50			1
@entity189 should not be too personal avoid obvious names or dates , and try not to use the same password for all sites			0
to create a complex password , use a mnemonic : for example , pick a song , the year it came out , and stick a £ sign at the end			0
you can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you ’re visiting			0
@entity207 @entity206 turn off a pc if you ’re not using it , especially after a browsing session ( a favourite time for hackers )			0
if a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one - off purchase , go for the latter			0
@entity220 ’s @entity219 if you ’re buying gifts and using your smartphone , do it on the retailer ’s app rather than using the main website			0
a dedicated app , if available , offers greater software protection than a web browser , especially if you ’re in a public place			0
if you ’re still nervous choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person			0
@entity18 names including @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 now offer this .			2

retailers across @entity7 will slash their prices in ' @entity10 ' sales offering everything from televisions to dresses
and you do n't have to brave the @entity18 - most retailers are offering the same discounts online as in store
