by @entity0 - parkinson published : 03:57 est , 17 april 2012 updated : 04:31 est , 18 april 2012 millions of commuters face fresh misery next week as @entity4 workers plan a 72 - hour walkout			1
the strikes , which come a week ahead of the mayoral election , stretch over four days and will involve the people who maintain and upgrade the tracks who are unhappy with negotiations over pensions and benefits			1
the @entity16 union , which represents around 1,000 staff on the @entity19 contracts , said its members will walk out at 4pm on tuesday until the same time on friday			1
maintenance workers on @entity4 are set to take part in a walkout stretching over four days in a row over pensions and benefits @entity16 general secretary @entity26 said : ' @entity16 members have delivered a massive mandate for action following a straightforward demand for parity with other @entity19 staff			1
' this dispute is about justice and about ensuring that all groups of staff under the umbrella of @entity4 receive the same rights and benefits , and our members have no choice but to strike to secure those basic rights			2
the staff work on the @entity45 , @entity46 and jubilee lines and provide a number of services , including emergency repairs , across the entire network			2
militant : @entity26 says the strike is a bid to get parity with other @entity19 staff the row is over union demands for all @entity19 staff to be allowed to join the @entity59 pension scheme and receive the same travel concessions as those who work for @entity4			1
@entity16 officials said the strike will have a ' widespread ” impact on tube services across the network			0
the announcement follows a 4 - 1 vote in favour of industrial action in a ballot of union members			0
@entity73 , chief executive of @entity74 , said : ' the last thing @entity77 businesses need at the minute is another @entity4 strike costing millions in lost business and damaging the city 's reputation especially with just 100 days to go to the @entity82			1
' the @entity16 should call off this needless strike and work to find a settlement before any damage is done			0
' mr @entity26 continued : ' we have gone through all the negotiating channels but @entity19 has refused to budge and have refused to engage in meaningful talks and that pig - headed approach has raised the temperature on the shop floor and has resulted in this strike action being called			1
' @entity94 employees have been allowed back into the @entity59 pension fund and now also have the same travel facilities as other @entity4 employees			2
' @entity19 is now a wholly owned subsidiary of @entity59 and there is simply no excuse for refusing to give equal pension and pass rights			2
' the union remains ready to talk , and the strong mandate for this industrial action shows @entity19 and @entity59 the depth of anger there is over this blatant lack of fairness and justice			1
' @entity19 operations director @entity111 said : ' a strike on this issue is completely unnecessary and will not achieve anything			1
' we urge the @entity16 leadership to end their strike threat and return to talks , as it will only be resolved through constructive discussion			0
' the @entity16 's ballot showed that less than 44 per cent of its members voted in favour of strike action			1
any action would be by maintenance staff , not tube drivers and station staff			0
the lines affected include the @entity129 , @entity45 and @entity46 lines tens of thousands of @entity133 workers will take industrial action and other forms of protest next month in the continuing bitter row over pensions			1
@entity139 said its 100,000 health service members will walk out on may 10 , a day after the @entity142 , which is expected to include a @entity143 on the government ’s controversial reforms			0
other workers are expected to join the strike and there could be further industrial action in june			1
@entity139 said its @entity133 members , including health visitors , pharmacists and paramedics , face paying an average of £ 30 a month more for their pensions			0
the dispute has been raging for well over a year and sparked a strike by more than 1.5 million public sector workers last november			2
@entity139 said it expected other public sector unions to join the may 10 action as part of the continuing campaign of opposition to the government ’s changes			0
officials pointed out that the pension reforms came against a backdrop of pay freezes and cuts in the public sector , and the prospect of regional pay being introduced			0
national officer @entity174 said : ' the government is picking the pockets of health workers by an average of £ 30 a month in order to pay for pension changes which will see people having to work longer to get less			0
' this disgraceful attack comes against a backdrop of pay freezes and the threat of regional pay in the public sector			0
in the face of continued attacks , health workers will be stepping up their campaign and looking to join other public sector workers in taking action on may 10			2
' @entity139 ’s health members voted by more than 9 - 1 to reject the pension changes			0
' should a strike go ahead , we have plans in place which will enable @entity4 to operate tube services on all three lines and to minimise any disruption			2
' earlier this month it was revealed that @entity4 drivers could earn an extra £ 6,000 in bonus payments for working during the @entity82 this summer			0
drivers are also in line for overtime payments , and enhanced pay packets for shifts which extend beyond 1.30am			0
previously , mps have condemned payments to drivers as a ' bribe ' and accused the unions of holding the public to ransom			0
underground drivers have been offered the latest terms by transport chiefs for a period covering nine weeks to the end of the @entity221 , according to a document seen by the @entity223			0
a spokesman for @entity77 mayor @entity225 said : ' it will come as no surprise to @entity228 that , a week before the mayoral election , @entity229 's @entity16 friend @entity26 is trying to hit hard - working @entity228 and businesses			1
' mr @entity229 's deputy mayoral running mate , @entity232 , said : ' the failure of @entity225 and the @entity16 to resolve their differences comes at a huge cost to @entity228			1
now millions of @entity19 users are facing the huge inconvenience and disruption that comes with a @entity19 strike			2
' it has been 1,444 days since @entity225 was elected and he has still not bothered to meet representatives of the tube unions to discuss his manifesto promise to implement a no - strike deal			1
' @entity225 's failure to get a grip of the @entity19 has led to more tube strikes in the last four years than in the previous eight years			1
' @entity247 , @entity247 chairman of @entity249 's @entity248 , said : ' this is a dispute between @entity19 and the @entity16			0
' for the @entity16 to try and involve innocent tube users in an internal disagreement is totally out of order , especially given the damage it will do to @entity77 's economy			1
' both sides should get back round a table , hammer out a solution and the @entity16 should stop posturing			0
