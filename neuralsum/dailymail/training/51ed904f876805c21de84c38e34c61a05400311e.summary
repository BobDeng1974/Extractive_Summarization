when it comes to having a sense of adventure , there are few cats that can match @entity5			1
not even wild mountain cats			0
for @entity5 is a domestic feline who just loves scrambling up mountains and boulders in her native @entity11 with owner @entity12 , who originally wrote about his relationship with @entity5 on @entity14			1
the adorable feline was abandoned by her owners when she was just a few days old – but luckily climbing - mad mr @entity12 adopted her			1
@entity17 n't no meow - tain high enough : @entity5 scaling @entity19 slabs with owner @entity12 rock on : @entity21 soloing at @entity22 rock on : @entity21 soloing at @entity22 @entity5 soon came to love accompanying him on his hilly adventures and he even bought her a miniature harness			1
now they hit the trails at weekends and camp overnight together , while mr @entity12 's other cat keeps his girlfriend company at home			1
mr @entity12 , 37 , said : ‘ i just knew one day i would get a pet and when i did i would take it everywhere with me			2
to boulder - ly go : @entity5 takes a leap at @entity34 new beginning : the adorable feline was abandoned by her owners when she was just a few days old - but @entity12 gave her a loving home all - conquering : @entity5 and mr @entity12 on the top of devils golf ball in @entity41 ‘ @entity5 is perfect - she 's a natural in the mountains			1
i make sure she is kept on the best quality cat food			0
‘ @entity5 is an athlete , she trains hard , and diet is an important part of any athlete 's complete routine			2
’ @entity5 was taken into a shelter as part of a litter without its mother in 2013 and was moments from being put down as the shelter did n't have the resources to bottle feed them			2
but emergency shelter @entity57 took her on and housed her at their ranch where mr @entity12 went to find an animal companion			2
paw - some : @entity5 in little wild horse slot , @entity11 after just four seconds together he knew that @entity5 was the kitten he wanted to bring home when she climbed on him and curled up round his shoulders			1
as soon as she was grown mr @entity12 took her out to @entity68 - a vast expanse of hills with no vegetation so she could get over her fear of being in the open and learn to walk alongside him			2
since she completed her training , @entity5 has been to some of the biggest climbing landmarks in @entity11 , including @entity75 , @entity76 and the @entity22			1
feeling peaky : @entity5 1,000 feet up in a day @entity5 and mr @entity12 can do a six - mile round trip			1
they go on trips so often that mr @entity12 adopted another cat , @entity81 , for his girlfriend @entity82 to make up for his absence on the sofa			1
when they are roaming through valleys or across plains @entity5 wanders harness @entity88 they are heading for a steep peak the plucky cat gets her own harness and is attached to @entity12 with carabiners and ropes			1
her highest summit so far has been the ' thousands of @entity97 ' climb - five stages of climbing totalling 1000 feet			0
while she normally follows mr @entity12 wherever he goes without a problem , on the way down from the thousand foot climb , her tail got caught in some of @entity12 's abseiling equipment and she lost a tuft of hair trying to get out			2
and though @entity12 sometimes has to scramble into caves or onto ledges to bring her down when she gets stuck , @entity5 is still the best climbing partner @entity12 's ever had			1
mr @entity12 added : ‘ i just start hiking in the morning and she 'll run and follow me now			2
‘ i do free climbing without ropes and then for the really high or steep ascents i harness her up			0
‘ cats are idiots sometimes and they will wander away and get lost if you 're not careful			0
‘ sometimes she gets stuck on a ledge and i have to save her			0
‘ there have been times when she 's fallen and i 've had to catch her but now she just loves climbing so much i ca n't stop her			0
‘ she has all the qualities a good climbing partner should have			0
she never complains , no matter how bad it gets ! ‘ and she always wants to go higher , and she pushes herself hard			0
‘ but she also knows when to stop			0
when she 's done , she 's done			0
she 'll find a cave or climb a tree and wo n't move until she 's rested			0
‘ and she cuddles me at night inside my sleeping bag and keeps me warm			0
