@entity0 says that the fact his gym has ' woman only ' hours is sexist against men when i became a member of my local gym , it was to exercise my body - not my human rights			1
but that 's exactly what i 'm doing with the @entity13 in north @entity14			1
the venue , owned by fitness company @entity16 in association with @entity19 , attracts hundreds of people from all sections of society : religious , atheist , male , female , young and old			0
there is no dominant demographic			0
everybody is welcome and everybody gets on			0
but not everybody is equal			0
because , in an age of political over-correctness , they ban all men and boys for 442 hours every year - simply because they are male			1
adding insult to injury , they still charge them the same full - price membership fee as women , but refuse to offer the equivalent option of male - only sessions			1
not only is this an outrageous business model , but it 's also sexist			0
especially given that council officials base it almost solely on women 's needs			1
fair ? i think not			0
but , because we live in an age of acceptable misandry , most people are too polite to say anything			0
several weeks ago , i formally complained to the general manager , asking him to change the policy with one of three alternatives : a ) maintain a women ’s hour but introduce a men 's alternative for fairness , @entity59 ) keep women ’s hour ( and only women ’s hour ) but annually charge men less , or @entity67 ) scrap single - gender sessions altogether			1
after all , if demand for women - only sessions is so great then the gym should put their money where their mouth is and fund it themselves			1
' a report by the @entity78 and @entity79 showed that a significant proportion of women ( 26 per cent ) “ hate the way they look when they exercise ”			1
' they replied in an email			0
' this takes on an even greater significance when you consider that women feel even more self - conscious when taking part in sport and physical activity when men are present			1
if you are wondering who or what [ we are ] it 's a charity that specialises in increasing women ’s physical activity levels			1
' translated into plain @entity103 , this means that a group of agenda - driven feminists say a minority of women ' feel ' bad about their bodies			2
and because heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women , their very existence makes it worse , so they should be banned			1
that 's like trying to clean a dirty face by rubbing a mirror			0
a report by the @entity78 and @entity79 showed that a significant proportion of women ' hate the way they look when they exercise ' it also assumes that all men in the gym are straight , when many of them are gay and have no interest in the female aesthetic			1
in fact , if they really wanted to , these men could be voyeuristic in the showers			2
so what next - gay and straight hours ? and what about lesbians - can they attend women - only sessions , or would it make their straight sisters uncomfortable ? gim me a break			1
if these women have issues with their bodies , i truly sympathise - but it 's their problem , not mine			2
nor is it any other man 's			0
and who 's to say we do n't have our own body hang - ups ? we know for a fact that increasing numbers of men suffer from anorexia and bulimia as well as ' bigorexia ' - the need to be as muscular as possible			2
rates of men having cosmetic surgery are also increasing year - on - year , so the facts speak for themselves			1
interestingly , women 's hour also has little to do with religion			2
the gym have scarcely used faith to justify their policy , but - even if they did - it still would n't excuse their unequal price structure			1
want women - only sessions for religious reasons ? fine - more power to you			2
but do n't ask men to pay for 442 hours they ca n't possibly use			1
no @entity176 would approve of that			0
' a group of agenda - driven feminists say a minority of women ' feel ' bad about their bodies			2
and because heterosexual men are naturally attracted to women , their very existence makes it worse , so they say we should be banned			1
' furthermore , when i explained that men typically die before women , thus have a greater need to access fitness services – something based on cold , hard fact rather than feelings – they had no convincing answer			1
tellingly , the gym 's policy also assumes that only men can objectify the opposite sex			1
but if tv shows like @entity205 taught us anything , it 's that women can be just as forthright			2
in fact , only two weeks later , i was forced to complain when four teenage girls were wolf - whistling at boys in the weights area – jeering and laughing , while ranking them by size			2
this would n't be acceptable if the sexes were reversed , so why is it tolerated here ? this is precisely why i ’m suing them for gender bias			1
not simply because their policy is unfair , but because it pathologises masculinity while simultaneously repressing it			1
as far as i 'm concerned it also breaks the law			2
so far , the legal team at @entity226 have simply made me laugh			2
they 've spent hours quoting @entity229 's @entity228 , but continue to miss the point			2
no customer , male or female , should pay for gym time they 're not allowed to use			2
ultimately , however , it has nothing to do with money			0
at best , i want a 10 per cent refund ; something i would donate to men 's charity @entity240 ( @entity242 ) , but , like the test case of mis - sold @entity244 , it would empower other men to demand the same compensation - hitting the gym where it hurts			1
' if these women have issues with their bodies , i truly sympathise - but it 's their problem , not mine			2
nor is it any other man 's ' but , finances aside , the @entity13 has a social responsibility to encourage equality as well as physical health			0
forcing men - whether 70 year - old pensioners or 13 year - old boys who attend with their mothers - to leave a room because of their gender , rather than their behaviour , is degrading			1
it 's also eerily reminiscent of when @entity267 were separated from their caucasian peers in 1940s @entity269			0
not least because the underlying maxim is the same			0
in this instance , that all men are inherently bad			2
this is a toxic message to send out , especially when those affected are frequently young boys in crucial stages of puberty and self - development			0
they criminalise men for being male , while telling women that they have less responsibility to contribute to functional gender relations			1
interestingly , it 's not just patrons who are angered			0
last week i spoke with two of the gym 's male fitness instructors who expressed their frustration with the ban - not least because , in the middle of a double - dip recession , neither can work during female - only sessions			0
' i ’m suing the gym for gender bias			1
not simply because their policy is unfair , but because it pathologises masculinity while simultaneously repressing it			1
' fortunately , i have other helpful supporters who want to liberate them			0
@entity303 , the woman who established the world 's first - ever domestic violence shelter in 1972 before becoming a men 's rights activist , has offered her backing			0
' this discrimination has no place in modern society ' , she said			0
meanwhile , equality charity parity and human rights campaigner @entity312 have described my fight as ' sensible and fair '			0
stateside , @entity269 website @entity315 have recently added their weight to my case			0
now , i ask common sense and @entity320 law to do the same			0
being a test case , my claim has sparked global interest because of its potential impact			0
if i win , gyms all over the country could be forced to update their policies			0
not only would this be physically healthy for people who want to exercise without restriction , but it would also be socially healthy for those who understand the toxicity of sexism , whether directed at men or women			1
for some , this might be a revelation in itself , but trust me : it comes from a place of genuine fairness			0
yes , my case may raise some eyebrows , but hopefully it will also raise some consciousness			0
because , currently , the staff at my gym are telling our young men they 're dangerous by default			1
and that 's a weight no man should learn to carry .			0

@entity0 is suing his gym over banning men at certain times
