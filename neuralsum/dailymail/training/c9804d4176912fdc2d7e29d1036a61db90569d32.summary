by @entity1 reporter published : 10:57 est , 9 june 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 9 june 2012 thousands of @entity3 bus workers have voted to go on strike in a row over extra payments for working during the @entity7			2
members of the unite union backed industrial action by more than nine to one , raising the prospect of crippling walkouts during the @entity7 , which start in the capital next month			1
the union wants a payment of £ 500 for each of the 20,000 bus workers it represents in @entity3 , pointing out that other transport employees are being paid a premium for being on duty during the event			2
protest : @entity3 bus drivers demonstrate outside the offices of @entity25 last month			1
they have now voted in favour of strike action the union will decide in the coming days whether to name strike dates following the ballot result			1
@entity31 has previously warned that ' strike action could take place up to and during the @entity7 ' , which last from july 27 to august 12			1
any strike action during the @entity7 threatens travel disruption on an unprecedented scale , with @entity3 's public transport network expected to face an extra three million daily journeys			1
as 10,500 athletes , 9,000 officials , 20,000 journalists and millions of spectators descend on 13 sporting sites - as well as normal @entity44 continuing to go about their daily business - the whole of the @entity3 's transport infrastructure will be needed to keep the capital moving			2
@entity25 ( @entity25 ) said the union was demanding a £ 500 ' bonus ' for each of the 24,000 bus drivers in @entity3 for working during the @entity53			1
but @entity25 maintains bus drivers are employed by private companies and that their pay and conditions are a matter for those private companies			1
' reprehensible ' : bus drivers want an extra £ 500 pounds each for working during the games - arguing they will have to cope with an extra 800,000 passengers @entity63 , @entity25 's managing director of surface transport , said : ' i am not surprised that 70 per cent of @entity3 's bus drivers did not vote for strike action			1
that is because about 70 per cent of @entity3 's local bus services are not affected by the @entity7			0
' the whole country is really entering into the spirit of the @entity7 and the overwhelming responsible majority are pulling out all the stops to make it a huge success			0
' only @entity31 appears to want to exploit it by adding a further multi-million pound burden to the hard - pressed farepayers and taxpayers of @entity3			0
' we are really disappointed that the @entity31 leadership is encouraging its members to take this unnecessary strike action			1
' @entity31 has already negotiated binding deals for pay and conditions with each of the @entity3 bus companies for this year and those companies are keeping their end of the deal			0
' attempting to tear up those agreements and get a new one with less than 50 days to go before the @entity7 is completely reprehensible and out - of - step with every other provider of services in this city this summer			2
' loggerheads : but @entity25 says it is up to the 21 private companies that run bus services across @entity3 as they set staff pay @entity31 said it was giving the bus companies a final opportunity to consider the ' landslide ' ballot result before announcing possible strike dates early next week			1
the union said bus workers were the only @entity3 transport employees not receiving an award for their extra effort during the @entity7			0
at least 800,000 extra passengers are predicted to use @entity3 's buses during the @entity7 , said @entity31			0
regional officer @entity111 , said : ' there are only seven weeks until the @entity7 and the whole world is watching @entity3			0
' it 's a disgrace that @entity3 's mayor , @entity116 , and the bus companies have allowed this dispute to get this far			0
' our members are only asking for an extra £ 17 a day which will just about buy you a pint of beer and a portion of fish and chips at the @entity7			0
' our members want the @entity7 to be a success but their patience has run out			0
' we have given @entity25 and the bus operators almost a year to resolve this issue			2
every single @entity3 transport worker in @entity3 will receive a reward to recognise their major contribution to this historic occasion except for @entity3 's bus workers			0
' it is time for @entity25 and the bus companies to consider this landslide vote in favour of strike action and resolve this dispute			1
' this dispute could be brought to an end now if the bus companies and @entity25 have the will to provide the relatively small amount of money compared to the billions being spent on the @entity7			2
' salaries for @entity3 bus drivers range from around £ 11,000 to £ 23,500 a year , but they can earn more with overtime .			0

strike action could take place during the games
@entity25 calls the *decision* to stage walkouts ' reprehensible '
