@entity1 's dream of turning @entity2 into their very own version of @entity4 is currently in ruins with the @entity8 legend 's team rooted to the foot of @entity11 's third division @entity10 the sight of the immaculately suited - and - booted midfield legend sat in the dug - out next to @entity14 last season or pacing the touchline with the @entity1 b team this campaign have raised expectations that he could follow the same kind of route as the former @entity24 boss			1
like @entity4 , @entity2 had been a playing legend for the club , and now , like @entity4 , he is starting out coaching the club 's kids but so far all has not gone according to plan			0
@entity2 is currently managing @entity28 , who are bottom of @entity30 the @entity1 legend may also be facing a 6 - month ban for working without the correct licence @entity35 , as @entity1 's second string are known , are currently on three points at the foot of the table , having lost five of their opening six fixtures			1
the poor start to the season comes at a bad time for the club 's homegrown players amid plans to streamline the youth set - up , scrapping @entity1 's c team , and the prospect that @entity2 could also be banned from coaching for six months if found guilty of managing @entity35 without the correct licence			1
@entity11 's national association of coaches , @entity54 , made a complaint about the former @entity57 winner at the start of the season and now the country 's @entity59 is studying the possibility that @entity1 have broken rule 104 of their code which could lead to a ban of between four and 16 games ( or one to six months )			2
the @entity8 spent last season working as @entity14 's assistant as they won the @entity68 many at the club had expected @entity2 to take over from @entity14 at some point , but that now looks unlikely head coaches in @entity11 need to have a level three national coaching diploma and @entity2 is still to obtain the relevant qualification			2
the president of @entity76 , who made the original complaint , said : ' @entity1 is one of the most recognisable sporting institutions in the world and a symbol of this sport but they have to follow the same rules as everyone else otherwise the competition is not fair			0
' with the prospect of a ban hanging over him , @entity2 must try to drag @entity35 away from the bottom of the table			0
the club relies on its b side to produce players for the first team but that can not happen if it is competing in the fourth tier of @entity11 football			0
like @entity98 's facebook page			0
@entity1 had been hoping that @entity2 could follow in the footsteps of @entity4 at @entity24 @entity4 managed @entity24 's youth team before taking charge of the first team with considerable success			1

@entity2 currently managing @entity28
@entity1 's second string compete in @entity11 's third @entity106
but they currently *sit* bottom of the table with just three points
@entity1 had hoped @entity2 could *emulate* @entity4 at @entity24
@entity8 could also face a six - month ban
@entity2 may be in *violation* of coaching licence rules in @entity11
