by @entity0 published : 17:11 est , 29 march 2012 updated : 17:11 est , 29 march 2012 tourists flocking to some of @entity4 ’s most famous landmarks during the @entity5 are to be treated to a new attraction – tents full of rowdy drunks			2
@entity9 is setting up shelters near @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to offer help to inebriated revellers			1
in an attempt to tackle drunken violence , policemen and nurses will be on hand to offer drunks cups of tea , medical treatment and advice on how to get home			1
sobering experience : tents like this one will be set up across central @entity4 to deal with drunken revellers during the @entity5 this summer the booze tents , which the @entity30 prefer to call ‘ departure zones ’ , will be open every thursday , friday and saturday for the next six months between 6pm and dawn			2
it is part of a crackdown on violence which will see the @entity37 flooded with up to 400 extra officers to prevent outbreaks of trouble on so - called ‘ red days ’			2
the move comes days after the prime minister unveiled plans to ban cut - price alcohol as part of a war on binge drinking			2
but critics have questioned the timing of the makeshift tents when the eyes of the world will be on the capital for the @entity5 and the @entity55			1
they fear the spectacle of drunken @entity57 staggering into all - night shelters will tarnish the image of the @entity57 abroad			1
yesterday @entity9 said @entity60 , its biggest - ever crackdown on anti-social behaviour in the @entity37 , would improve safety in the capital			0
as well as 400 extra officers in the area , six podiums will be set up to allow the police to spot troublemakers and to provide reassurance to the public			0
violent drunks who start brawls , drug dealers , pickpockets , unlicensed minicabs and dangerous rickshaw drivers are also being targeted , with the latter facing prosecution under an archaic law from 1839 that prohibits ‘ cycling furiously ’			0
on yer bike : dangerous rickshaw drivers could be prosecuted under an archaic 1839 law that prohibits ' cycling furiously ' @entity84 police chief superintendent @entity82 said that if the temporary tents proved successful , officers would consider looking for business sponsorship so the scheme could be expanded			0
he said : ‘ it ’s somewhere you can go to , or be sent to , where you can be looked after , get a cup of tea , bus advice and train advice as well as medical support			1
’ but yesterday @entity4 mayoral candidate @entity97 , who was a @entity98 member of @entity4 ’s @entity99 for 12 years , compared the unsightly tents to the occupy protest at @entity102			0
she said : ‘ it seems like occupy are having a tent for people to stay all night			1
it seems a bit overblown quite honestly			0
‘ i am a big fan of tents but erecting one for drunks in @entity11 when the eyes of the world are on @entity4 , it does not seem like a good idea to me			0

policemen and nurses will offer tea , medical treatment and advice on how to get home
critics fear spectacle of *paralytic* @entity57 staggering into all night shelters will tarnish @entity57 *'s* *reputation*
