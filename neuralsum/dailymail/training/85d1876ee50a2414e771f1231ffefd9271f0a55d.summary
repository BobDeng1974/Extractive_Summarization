by @entity0 most toddlers would face some stern words if they spewed profanities			2
but you would be hard - pressed to discipline this adorable little boy who grins cheekily as he rattles off his limited range of expletives			1
clutching a paper cup , and wearing a dinosaur t - shirt , it is slightly shocking to hear him say ' c * * p '			2
he then reels off a list of words prefaced by ' butt '			1
' @entity28 , butt hole , and butt crack , ' he blurts out , smugly smirking after each one at the prospect of breaking the rules			2
he continues : ' @entity28 nose , butt face , butt head , butt ... crack ? @entity28 ear , butt mouth , butt teeth ... butt head ... ' ' shut up ' is his next expletive , before launching into a comical list of ' butt ' words , including ' butt ear ' he stares bluntly at the camera as he unleashes ' butt head ' for the third time in his somewhat limited list his uncle , filming , starts to chuckle at the seemingly endless variations on words featuring ' butt '			1
finally , to round it all off , he lets out an unexpected : ' sh * * '			0
it takes his uncle by surprise , who bursts out laughing			0
the video has delighted @entity60 viewers - although some took to the comment section to blast it as irresponsible			1
stumped , he pauses , before saying ' butt ear , butt mouth , butt teeth ' and again : ' butt head ' he looks slightly baffled at his uncle chuckling away as the seemingly endless list goes on but he sends his uncle into fits of giggles by concluding the performance with a defiant ' sh * * ' some fawn over the adorable child , with one writing : ' this kid is amazing '			1
another wrote : ' so innocent , and then the end ! ' one wrote , ' awww so cute ! ' while another said : ' i only can hope my child will be as versed and familiar with the @entity83 language as your son			0
' but a handful of commenters have berated the video			0
one said : ' do another video and ask him about good words then i 'll watch it			0
' another wrote : ' foul - mouthed little kid			0
