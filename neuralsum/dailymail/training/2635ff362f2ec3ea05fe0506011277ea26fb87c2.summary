their numbers are likely to soar during the @entity7 as police revealed they had intelligence to suggest hordes of pickpockets and conmen from @entity2 and as far as away as @entity13 will flock to @entity14 to prey on visitors			1

( picture posed by models ) a number of suspects have been arrested recently around tourist attractions after forcing victims to march to cashpoints or hand over their bank card and pin numbers for so - called security checks			2
despite their broken @entity35 and lack of police uniform , some visitors have been taken in by fake warrant cards and have provided their name , address , bank details or even handed over their wallet on being asked to verify their identity			2
dozens of tourists have been stopped by the bogus bobbies around attractions such as @entity49 , @entity50 and areas such as @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
one favourite trick is to rifle through the pockets of the unsuspecting victim swiping valuables and cash cards , while claiming to perform a routine drugs search			0
another ruse used by the gangs is to seize bank cards and demand to know the accompanying pin numbers , saying they need the information to confirm the victim ’s identity and that they have permission to be in @entity5			2

’ he said officers had already seen a rise in pickpockets and offenders acting as bogus policemen			1
‘ tourists are being duped into giving their pin numbers over			2
‘ they are preying on people who maybe do n’t understand what a plain - clothes police officer looks like or might do			1
‘ they are preying on the vulnerability of tourists in @entity14			2
’ some people have been sucked in by the scam because of language difficulties and they hail from cultures which have a strong respect for people in authority , mr @entity75 said			0
crackdown : suspects have been arrested near tourist attractions including @entity49 ‘ it is theft ’ , he added			0

‘ they do not need to know your pin number			0
’ police also revealed that dozens of people across the world had been fleeced by online @entity7 ticket scams			1
more than 50 sports fans who spent thousands of pounds on fake tickets have been traced so far , but police believe scores more may have fallen victim to the multi-million pound black market trade ahead of the @entity74			0
mr @entity75 said 35 unauthorised and fraudulent websites offering tickets and accommodation packages had been suspended			0
but @entity71 has only managed to shut down a small number of websites suspected of selling fake @entity7 tickets , as many sites in @entity13 and @entity134 are beyond their reach			1
in a separate case , a multimillion pound international ticketing company has been summoned to appear before magistrates next month charged with 22 offences linked to the illegal sale of @entity7 tickets			0
police are also seeking a @entity143 for a @entity145 suspect who fled @entity146 after his fraudulent @entity7 ticket website was uncovered			2
yesterday a @entity142 spokesman said : ‘ criminals posing as police officers in order to dupe unsuspecting members of the public into handing over valuables , cash card details or money have been an ongoing problem in @entity14 and we have , unfortunately , seen a recent increase in this type of crime			0
