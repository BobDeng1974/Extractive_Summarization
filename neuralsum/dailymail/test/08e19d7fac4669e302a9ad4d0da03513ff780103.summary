a man who died in @entity1 of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in @entity6 , a @entity8 report has revealed			1
the unnamed man , who died from variant @entity12 ( @entity11 ) disease in may 2014 , just 18 months after he first showed symptoms , was a naturalized @entity15 citizen originally from the @entity16			1
the report concluded the man 's illness resulted from his eating tainted @entity21 beef before he moved to the @entity15 in the 1990s			1
the extreme rarity of the disease , especially in the @entity15 , led the man -- who was in his 40s -- to be misdiagnosed with psychiatric symptoms before ultimately receiving the @entity11 death sentence			1
contracted in the 1990s : a man who died in @entity1 of the human version of mad cow disease last year likely contracted it from eating beef raised in @entity6 , a @entity8 report has revealed @entity15 public health officials were concerned initially because the man had n't previously lived in either the @entity21 or @entity35 , where all three previously documented victims of @entity11 in the @entity15 had lived previously			1
however , the joint investigation between the @entity8 and @entity38 concluded the man likely contracted the disease over a decade before moving to the @entity15 he 'd lived in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- all countries where the @entity21 exported its beef , reports live science			1
the man , after doctors finally came to suspect @entity11 , had his blood , urine and spinal fluid tested for the disease , but only his urine came back positive			2
after his death , an autopsy allowed brain tissue to be tested			0
it indicated conclusively the man suffered from @entity11			0
' the potential difficulty in making the clinical diagnosis in many patients with @entity11 and the delay with which the disease is first suspected raises the concern that @entity11 can be missed , ' wrote the researchers			0
destroys the brain and spinal cord : brain tissue showing spongiotic changes in the cortex , and loss of neurons in a case of variant @entity12 disease what is @entity77 ? mad cow disease is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal form of a prion protein that destroys the brain and spinal cord			1
the disease was first identified in @entity6 in 1986 , although research suggests that the first infections may have spontaneously occurred in the 1970s			2
the disease is believed to be spread by feeding calves meat and bone meal contaminated with @entity77 or scrapie , a prion disease in sheep			2
illnesses similar to @entity77 also have been seen in elk , deer and exotic zoo animals			0
there were 36,000 diagnosed cases of mad cow disease in @entity6 in 1992 , during that height of a mad cow epidemic there			1
twenty - nine cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2011 , according to the @entity104			0
who gets variant cjd ? since variant cjd was first reported in 1996 , a total of 229 patients with this extremely rare disease from 12 countries have been identified			0
according to @entity8 , 177 of those patients were from the @entity21			0
there has never been a case of @entity11 that did not have a history of exposure within a country where the cattle disease , @entity77 , was occurring			0
it is believed that the persons who have developed @entity11 became infected through their consumption of cattle products contaminated with the agent of @entity77 or in three cases , each reported from the @entity21 , through receipt of blood from an asymptomatic , infected donor			1
there is no known treatment of @entity11 and it is invariably fatal			0
what 's the @entity11 and @entity12 this variant form of @entity11 should not be confused with the classic form of cjd that is endemic throughout the world , including the @entity15			1
the median age at death of patients with classic cjd in the @entity15 , for example , is 68 years , and very few cases occur in persons under 30 years of age			2
in contrast , the median age at death of patients with @entity11 in the @entity21 is 28 years			0
in contrast to classic @entity11 , @entity11 in the @entity21 predominantly affects younger people , has atypical clinical features , with prominent psychiatric or sensory symptoms at the time of clinical presentation and delayed onset of neurological abnormalities , including ataxia within weeks or months , dementia and myoclonus late in the illness , a duration of illness of at least 6 months , and a diffusely abnormal non-diagnostic electroencephalogram			2

a @entity15 citizen from the @entity16 who died of variant @entity12 in @entity1 in may 2014 likely ate contaminated @entity21 meat
investigators say the unnamed man , who was in his 40s , likely ate the tainted meat before moving to the @entity15 in the 1990s
variants @entity12 is a deadly neurological disease caused by abnormal proteins -- @entity6 's seen *hundreds* of cases since the 1990s
