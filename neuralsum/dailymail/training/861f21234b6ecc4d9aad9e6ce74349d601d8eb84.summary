by @entity1 reporter published : 10:05 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 11 april 2013 move over , @entity2 ... the @entity3 has been recreated by @entity4 - sew ! artist @entity5 uses hundreds of thousands of buttons to create each of his unique pieces			1
each is painted individually and then left to dry before being hung from a clear shelf at the correct height			0
the @entity3 looks as bright as a button ( right ) while the @entity16 vending machine has every detail represented since he started making the hanging sculptures , he has made a version of @entity3 , a piano , a swing and a vending machine , among others			1
each of the eye - catching sculptures takes him about a month and a half to complete			0
the process of making the pieces of art begins with making an arcylic box with thousands of holes in , from which the buttons can hang			1
he then painstakingly paints each single button and waits for them to dry before hanging them precisely in place			0
making a splash : this shower is home to a rubber duck , while this fountain looks like an ideal bird bath too pick and mix : buttons of various colours appear as bubblegum sweets and prizes @entity52 , 36 , from @entity53 , @entity54 , said : ' i like the idea of something that looks solid and heavy but is actually light and inconsistent to the touch			1
' the technique is always in development , it is always changing and it takes me some time to make each one look decent			0
' i have always loved buttons for some unknown reason , and i keep discovering so much history behind them , it is really fascinating			1
' i recently discovered a button fair , where people from @entity70 and buy really unique and expensive buttons			2
@entity72 it ! there wo n't be any music - loud or otherwise - being played on this piano @entity77 and beautiful : a jukebox and a bunch of balloons are easily recognisable roll up , roll up : this candy floss stall is made from hundreds of buttons that hang down from an acrylic shelf ' i have so many shapes and materials to choose from , which makes them a really fun , ancient and noble object to work with			1
' also , i try to see the " personality " behind the buttons , i wonder what garment the button could have been a part of and the person who used the garment			2
' the buttons are as alive as the people who wear them			2
so many people say to me , " i do n't know why , but i keep my buttons for years , i ca n't trow them away ! "			0
' the sculptor added : ' i do n't really have a favourite because i like them all - it sounds like a cliche but it 's true			0
