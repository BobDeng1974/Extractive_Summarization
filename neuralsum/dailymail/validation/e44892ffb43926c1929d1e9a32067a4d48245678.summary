a genetic condition has left @entity1 paralyzed since 2003 , but revolutionary new technology is allowing her the ability to feed herself chocolate , give high fives and even fly a fighter jet			2
last week , the @entity7 ( known as @entity7 ) , unveiled the amazing results of a two - year experiment involving the 55 - year - old quadriplegic woman , which they carried out in conjunction with the @entity14			0
@entity1 agreed to let the super-secretive agency surgically implant pea - sized probes into her brain as they sought a way to turn her thought to actions			1
in addition to moving a robotic arm , @entity1 was also able to experience piloting a plane with the same technology			1
the research team let @entity1 connect to a flight simulator , where she had amazing results flying an f - 35 jet and @entity52 airplane not with a joystick - but with her thoughts alone			2
while the results give hope to anyone who suffers from limited mobility , they also draw up questions about whether the technology could be used for destructive purposes - such as soldiers controlling surrogate versions with their minds , out of combat			1
the ability to fly : researchers also found a way to hook @entity1 up to a flight simulator , and she was able to use the device to fly a @entity71 and @entity52 with her mind ' in doing that work , we can now see the future where we can free the brain from the limitations of the human body , ' darpa director @entity73 said at the @entity81 forum in @entity82 last week			2
' we can only imagine amazing good things and amazing potentially bad things that are on the other side of that door			0
' while the research was initially aimed at helping soldiers with motor problems , @entity87 says they will continue to look into other ways it can be used in the military			0
' we do n't want to only go play in the safe places			0
that would be a violation of our mission , ' @entity87 said			0
the future : the breakthrough technology brings hope to those who suffer from limited mobility			1

@entity1 agreed to *undergo* *procedure* to implant two pea - sized lobes into her brain for @entity7 military research project
the lobes now allow her to operate a robotic arm and pilot a plane using a flight simulator
technology brings hope to others struggling with limited mobility
however , it also raises questions about whether the military will find a way to use the technology for destructive *warfare* purposes
