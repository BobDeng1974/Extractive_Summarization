by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 25 january 2013 for most people scrap wood means little more than an improvised door stop or a replacement paper weight , if not just rubbish for the bin			1
but not for artist @entity6 , who sees a miniature home , office or skyscraper in every wooden off cut that falls onto his studio floor			1
the @entity13 - based sculptor has carved thousands of pieces of scrap wood and carefully placed them together to form a vast city skyline			1
the wooden skyscrapers , made in different shapes and sizes , look remarkably like the @entity21 in @entity22			1
big @entity23 : the wooden skyscrapers , made in different shapes and sizes , look remarkably like the @entity21 in @entity22 skyline of sight : growing up in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity6 says he would stare at the city skyline from hilltops as a child ' you could see the @entity22 skyline from the hilltops the collection , totalling a staggering five thousand individual buildings also includes a huge ‘ city wheel ’ - which is almost five feet high			1
and the artist explained how the idea came about			0
the 28 - year - old said : ' i grabbed a piece of scrap wood from the bin , and without thinking , made some cuts			1
' in a few minutes the piece started to look strangely familiar , like a screwdriver or a mini skyscraper			0
@entity50 you believe it ? @entity13 - based artist @entity6 even made a table out of these unique pieces of wood big wheel : the collection , totalling a staggering five thousand individual buildings also includes a huge ' city wheel ' - which is almost five feet high ' i grabbed another piece of scrap wood , and made another object - this time , it looked like wrench , or a table leg			1
' in the next hour i made 15 more - i stayed up that night and worked until morning			0
' in 24 hours i made more than 200 , all intricately different from the next			0
scrapping the rules : @entity6 says his habit of using scrap wood is ' my reference to the idea that in order to be successful in the city , we must be willing and able to make something out of nothing ' connections : the artist , who has 10 years of woodworking experience , was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father , the owner of a wood mill ' when i stood them next to each other , i discovered i was making a small city of objects that were all distinctly different and unique			1
' and the artist , who owns his design studio in @entity13 , said his fascination with skylines started when he was a child			1
he added : ' i ’ve loved city skylines ever since i was a child , growing up in @entity27 , @entity28			1
' you could see the @entity22 skyline from the hilltops - i always liked to stare at it			2
' growing up , i experienced an outsider ’s perspective , always viewing the city from the distance			0
but from that viewpoint , its very captivating			0
' i ’ve always been inspired by @entity22 , but mostly for the culture , the fast - paced environment , and the notion that it ’s the place people go in search of freedom , fortune and fame			0
' the artist says : ' to date , i ¿ ve made roughly 5,000 skyscrapers			2
i have been cutting a handful or two every day lately - the total number is still growing ' and the artist , who has 10 years worth of woodworking experience , was able to create this collection as he gets his own supply from his father			0
he continued : ' my dad has a small wood mill in @entity28 - he has provided me with most of the wood i use to make furniture			2
' i usually gather a bunch of scrap wood and put a pile next to the band saw			2
' i put my headphones in , listen to my favourite music , and start cutting - i have worked through the night on several occasions			0
