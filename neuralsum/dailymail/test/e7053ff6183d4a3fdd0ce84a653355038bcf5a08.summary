neanderthals may have eaten recently deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals			1
this is according to marks found on the fossils of two adults and a child unearthed in the @entity11 region of @entity12			0
similar marks have been seen at other @entity15 sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives			1
neanderthals may have eaten deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals			2
this is according to cuts seen on a number of fossils dating back 57,600 years			0
pictured is cuts on a forearm bone since the @entity35 site in @entity11 was unearthed , the discovery of fossil remains of animals , humans and tools has allowed the site to be identified as a hunting area for @entity15			1
the latest study has , for the first time , studied the bones of three individuals found between 1967 and 1980 at the @entity11 site dating back some 57,600 years			2
these are an incomplete diaphysis – or the middle part of long bones - of a right forearm bone , another of a left leg bone and the majority of a right thigh bone			1
the latter belonged to a child			0
when compared to the remains of other neanderthals and modern humans , scientists found bone marks made shortly after death			1
cut marks seen on the thigh bone of the @entity15 child			1
@entity63 , professor at the @entity65 , and lead authors told @entity67 : ' some @entity15 groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments ' several years ago , @entity74 researchers came up with a dramatic new theory for the end of the @entity15 - that humans ate them			1
the researchers point out we have already contributed to the extinction of 178 large mammals			0
they are now involved in further research on the bones of neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks			2
' except in its native @entity88 , in the other continents @entity90 can be considered as an invasive alien species , ' write researchers @entity92 and @entity94 of the @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity74			0
' the only manner to test it is to find direct evidences of modern human eating marks on @entity15 remains , such cut or broken marks on bones in artifacts made by modern humans , ' he said			1
the team believe that as @entity108 spread into @entity109 and @entity110 , where homo neanderthalensis was , it was treated just another food source - and a competitor			0
@entity63 , professor at the @entity65 , and lead authors told @entity67 : ' some @entity15 groups cut and tore apart child or adult corpses shortly after death using lytic instruments			1
' the thigh bone fragment , which appears to be from a child who died at the age of 9 or 10 , shows two large cut marks half a centimetre apart			1
from its state of preservation , the researchers suggest that the bone was fractured when still fresh with the aim of separating the upper and lower extreme of the thigh bone , where the joints are located			1
the upper edge exhibits marks of a ' post-mortem ' impact with markings that do not follow natural separation of the bones			2
the lower region had a clear , oblique spiral break which seems to have occurred while the bone was fresh			0
' given the morphology of the fractures , it may be that the body of this child was manipulated shortly after death , ' professor @entity63 said			0
' the right leg received a series of blows that fractured the femur , and the cut marks identified are anthropic in nature ; in other words , there is no visible evidence of animal bites			2
' the bones of the two adults show these and other markings			0
the fragment of the radius , possibly belonging to a man , also has small , fine cut marks made with flint tools shortly after death			1
' the most significant are three striations together crossing over each other while the bone was still fresh , ' the study says			0
in the leg bone , although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen , there are also signs of damage at the lower @entity180 ' there is no evidence of cut similar marks have been seen at other @entity15 sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives as for the leg bone , although the fresh fractures of both extremes can be seen , there are also signs of damage at the lower end			1
but ' there is no evidence of cuts or traces of carnivores ' teeth , ' the researcher insists			0
the expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism , due to the large number of animal bones found on the site ' they might have been rituals – still in the 21st century these continue in certain parts of the world – or for food – gastronomic cannibalism or due to need , ' the authors claim			0
' to date we have been able to demonstrate these manipulations at several @entity15 sites in @entity109 , which are of course much more recent , including in groups of contemporary humans , but we have not been able to demonstrate the consumption of human meat by @entity15 , ' professor @entity63 said			2
the expert remains cautious regarding the of cannibalism , due to the large number of animal bones found on the site			0
the discovery was made in the @entity11 region of @entity12 in south - western @entity11			0

study looked at @entity15 forearm bone , left leg and right thigh bone
all of the bones had unnatural breakage marks possibly made by tools
scientists say @entity15 groups pulled apart bones on dead bodies
it is not yet known whether this was done for food or in a funeral ritual
