did this snake kill itself using its own venom ? it certainly looked that way when @entity4 from @entity5 found the dead snake on saturday still plunging its fangs into its own neck			1
he was called to a home at @entity11 , just south - west of @entity12 , after a woman found the 1.5 metre @entity14 on her doorstep			1
but she said it was still wriggling after half an hour so i went over to relocate it , ' mr @entity4 told @entity26			2
' i could immediately see something was n't quite right with the snake			0
when i picked it up i noticed it was still biting down firmly on its neck			0
' i thought what on earth - it looked like it had bitten its own neck and died			0
' @entity4 from @entity5 said he found the snake still biting its neck on saturday @entity4 took the snake to a vet to determine the cause of death , but only found swelling near puncture wounds mr @entity4 took the snake to a vet to see if he could shed light on how it died			1
' he checked to see if it had been run over , but the only thing he could find was swelling near the bite , ' mr @entity4 said			1
' it must have been stung by something and died			0
a business found this @entity14 keeping warm in the empty paper tray of their photocopier @entity4 opened the garage door of a @entity57 garage to find two @entity58 and an industrial vacuum cleaner mid embrace @entity61 often remove @entity63 snakes from inside homes , including this one @entity65 @entity61 rescued this @entity66 from a woman 's tv cabinet ' apparently when they do have a trauma they do try and bite around the area			1
i suspect the snake did n't end its own life on purpose , but was possibly in severe pain and ended up in this unfortunate position			0
' in his 10 years as a snake catcher , mr @entity4 said he has n't come across a dead snake still latched onto itself			2
' it 's just a really odd catch			0

@entity4 from @entity5 was trying to relocate it when he realised the snake had died still latching onto its neck
