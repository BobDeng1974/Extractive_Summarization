for the best part of two hours he cut a frustrated figure , smothered by the attention of a superb @entity5 defence and staring at the terrifying prospect of losing out on penalties			1
at 27 there might have been no way back for @entity10 , the last realistic chance of winning a @entity12 , and so the opportunity to emulate the great @entity14 , possibly gone			2
but @entity15 had said @entity10 can do for @entity16 now what @entity14 did for their country back in 1986 and for the fourth consecutive game of this astonishing tournament the magical , masterful @entity20 proved the difference between the two teams			1

that honour would go to the irrepressible @entity116			0
but @entity10 would emerge as the provider of the all - important pass , delivered to perfection , after an explosive trademark run			1
for @entity28 it was so , so cruel			0
for 118 minutes they had more than provided an answer to the best that @entity16 could throw at them			1
they were the better team for the first half , creating much the better chances , and courageous in their defiance after the break			0
@entity35 , their goalkeeper , was magnificent			0
as were @entity88 and his colleagues in the @entity5 back four			2
after the first half chances that were so wastefully missed , it made defeat all the more painful for a @entity5 team that certainly looks capable of troubling @entity136 come those @entity138 qualifiers			1
that said , @entity53 will not be in charge and @entity141 can be thankful for that			0
because a manager who has twice won the @entity144 , who yesterday even had to deal with the tragic news of his brother ’s death , proved himself a brilliant tactician here			0
his side might have conceded five to a rampant @entity150 but here , once again , was proof of the impact a top international coach can have on his team			0
while @entity53 encouraged @entity44 to terrorise @entity16 ’s defence in a manner that delighted the @entity46 whose yellow shirts broke up the sea of blue and white that dominated the @entity161 , he had his more defensive players brilliantly drilled to nullify the attacking threat of @entity16			2
@entity30 ended up conceding possession 37 times in normal time			1
@entity10 found himself surrounded by three or four red shirts every time he was on the ball			1
indeed , that burst of speed that saw @entity10 ride one challenge before knocking that pass into the path of @entity30 represented the first time he had found space between the @entity5 midfield and the back four			1
but as @entity180 acknowledged afterwards ‘ it only take one second for @entity10 to decide a match ’			2
readying : the teams waiting to come out before the start of the game observant : @entity10 looks on during the national anthem harried : @entity28 's @entity44 fights with @entity73 for the ball @entity186 & white : @entity16 fans watching on four square : @entity10 surrounded by four @entity5 defenders spacious : @entity10 was n't given any space all afternoon @entity191 : @entity10 that it does , but is also does n’t hide the fact that @entity16 remain far too reliant on their captain			1
even when he endures what was comfortably his worst performance of the tournament so far			0
for the @entity16 fans it must have been torturous , the goal coming as such a relief to one chap he jumped in the air and proceeded to tumble with quite a thud down the stairs			1
the fact that he was dressed as @entity209 served only to magnify his embarrassment , although his apparent escape from serious injury was nothing short of miraculous			0
more predictable was the evidence of an imbalance in this @entity16 team			2
@entity15 might have insisted that the defensive fragility they had shown until now would be addressed			0
but the @entity5 were doing a number on his side , soaking up the pressure and hitting them on the break			2
@entity224 : the @entity161 in @entity112 packed to the rafters watching on : @entity5 boss @entity53 ( left ) and @entity16 coach @entity15 eyeing the action tame : @entity16 goalkeeper @entity63 saves the attempt of @entity94 kept out : @entity228 making a save stopper : @entity5 goalkeeper @entity35 makes a diving save after a cagey first 25 minutes @entity232 should have tested @entity63 more than he did			1
his shot was way too tame			0
but if @entity235 was guilty of lacking conviction , it was nothing compared to @entity94 when he was sent clear by a marvellous , defence - splitting pass from @entity44			0
he had only @entity63 to beat but his left - foot chip was floated meekly into the arms of a relieved @entity16 goalkeeper and to the understandable disappointment of @entity44			1
a quick assessment of the 22 - year - old @entity44 : at times it was like watching a young @entity245 with all those step - overs but he really is a super little player			0
after the break and the @entity5 would continue to squander opportunities , with @entity249 misfiring after another pass from @entity44			2
hurting : @entity30 goes to ground battle : @entity94 of @entity28 fights for the ball with @entity67 nerves : the @entity16 replacements watch from the bench with the game still at 0 - 0 pains : @entity35 hits the ground injured effort : @entity10 has a pop on goal by now @entity16 were starting to threaten more			1
@entity35 had to stretch to parry an angled shot from @entity67 , and was more impressive still when he then diverted a close - range header from @entity72 over his crossbar			0
@entity35 would then deny @entity10 when it seemed the @entity268 superstar had finally carved out an opportunity for himself			2
the final chance in normal time would nevertheless fall to the @entity5 , with @entity88 missing with a header he too should have buried			1
in extra time , @entity35 would then thwart @entity66			0
but not in the 118th minute			0
not once @entity10 had intervened and @entity30 had produced what was a fabulous finish			1
intake : but it finished goalless after normal time huddle : hitzfeld rallying his troops during the break leap : @entity5 defender @entity88 rises for the ball doubled up : @entity69 and @entity64 take on @entity92 unexpected : @entity283 goes shoulder to shoulder with @entity108 referee @entity107 crucial : @entity16 players celebrate their dramatic winner			1

@entity30 nets dramatic winner in extra-time to give @entity16 victory
@entity10 provided the superb assist that set up the goal
@entity297 had finished goalless after normal time before the late strike
@entity5 sub @entity300 missed last - minute *sitter* to equalise
@entity16 *progress* through to the quarter - finals
