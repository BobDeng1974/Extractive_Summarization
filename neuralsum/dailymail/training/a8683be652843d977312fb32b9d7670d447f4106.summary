the clinics , run by associates in @entity12 , were shuttered last month after state regulators received a complaint about a patient receiving an abortion - inducing drug with no doctor present			1
the patient , 38 - year - old @entity19 , underwent the procedure on february 13 in @entity21 and was ' still very drowsy ' when she was allegedly left in the care of an unlicensed medical assistant			1
she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and died later at a hospital			0
regulators said her doctor , @entity27 , had failed to use a defibrillator - which was later found to be broken			1
@entity27 is one of the three suspended doctors , according to the @entity30			1
two more , drs. @entity31 and @entity32 , have also had their licenses suspended			1
scene : three doctors have had their licenses suspended after a patient died at an abortion clinic , located in this complex in @entity21 , in february after she was being watched by an untrained worker the allegations appear in documents posted online by the state office of @entity43 , which regulates the clinics - in @entity21 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 - and ordered them to close			1
the clinics are affiliated with @entity50 women 's services , a company controlled by dr. @entity52 , a beleaguered abortionist whose license has been suspended or revoked in five states			1
he was at one point charged with murder for late - term abortions , but the charges were dropped			1
@entity27 lost her license because unlicensed employees at the clinic were dispensing drugs to patients , the regulators noted , not because of the patient 's death			1
@entity31 was on duty at the @entity21 clinic on may 4 when an unlicensed clinic employee performed an ultrasound on a patient and found that the woman was carrying more than one fetus			1
the employee then gave the woman misoprostol , a drug that 's used to induce abortions , according to the @entity30			0
suspended : @entity31 , left , was on duty when an unlicensed employee gave a patient drugs			1
the clinics are affiliated with dr @entity52 , right , who has had his license suspended in five states the patient who died after visiting the @entity86 in @entity12 in @entity21 on february 13 was 38 - year old @entity19			1
@entity87 was 12.5 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion and her doctor , @entity27 told @entity3 @entity91 inspectors that @entity87 slept through her abortion			2
the doctor then left the woman in the room with an unqualified worker , according to the inspector 's report			2
the worker filled out paperwork as @entity87 lay on the table			0
she later called for a second worker to help her move @entity87 to the recovery area			0
the second worker noticed @entity87 was pale and not breathing , and they notified @entity105			0
no one at the clinic had current cpr certification , and there was no attempt to use a defibrillator , which was found to be broken			0
@entity87 's death certificate showed she died from @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115			0
it is unknown how long she went without breathing			0
inspectors found staff failed to provide proper post-anesthesia care and observation			0
after the patient took the drug , @entity31 arrived and determined that the patient needed a surgical abortion because the multiple fetuses had made her uterus larger , the board said			2
@entity31 told the patient she would have to go elsewhere for a surgical abortion , they said			2
@entity31 and other staff told regulators it was standard procedure in the clinics for patients to be given misoprostol at 11 weeks or later , regardless of whether a doctor was present , the board wrote			1
@entity141 , the medical director of the clinics , was responsible for patient care at the time of @entity87 's death			2
he previously had his license suspended by the board in 1988 for sexual contact with three patients and again in 1995 for sexual conduct with another patient			1
in 2011 , he was placed on two years of probation by the board for failing to meet appropriate standards for delivery of quality medical and surgical care			0
@entity157 , who also represents @entity158 , said the allegations related to wrongdoing at the abortion clinics do not involve his client			0
he said the previous sexual contact cases ' involved kisses '			0
@entity165 , the attorney for @entity27 , said that most of the allegations were broad and do not directly involve his client , and that the patient 's death at the @entity21 clinic was not her fault			1
he said the allegation that unlicensed workers administered drugs on her watch was false			2
' she 's a well - trained , well - qualified and well - experienced doctor , ' @entity165 said			2
' there just appears to be something that happened to that particular patient , but there was n't anything wrong with the procedure as far as we know			0
' lax procedures : the doctors and other clinic employees said it was standard procedure for patients to receive abortion - inducing drugs , like those pictured , whether a doctor was present or not a hearing on the suspensions of the doctors ' licenses is scheduled for next wednesday			1
@entity157 has requested a hearing before an administrative law judge on the closure of the clinics			0
that hearing has not yet been scheduled , he said			0
@entity157 , an attorney who represents associates in @entity12 , said dr @entity202 is not the owner of the clinics or the llc. he declined to identify the owners			2
but @entity207 , president of the @entity208 , or @entity208 , which represents abortion providers , said it was common knowledge among providers that the @entity3 clinics belong to him			0
' it 's not surprising that his four @entity3 clinics have been suspended , ' @entity207 said			0
' we have been an advocate for his substandard clinics being shut down wherever they operate in the country			0
