by @entity1 - @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 14:20 est , 24 january 2014 @entity3 has claimed @entity4 rejected a seven - figure payday to hold a rematch of the slugfest that ended so controversially last year - but prospects of a second bout appear good after the @entity10 ordered a rematch , to be fought within 90 days			1
promoter @entity12 revealed to @entity13 this week that he hopes to stage the rematch in a stadium on either may 24 or may 31 , but @entity3 revealed negotiations have hit a stumbling block			2
@entity13 understands @entity4 earned in the region of £ 500,000 for their first compelling fight , which super-middleweight world champion @entity3 won via a controversial ninth - round stoppage on november 23			1
best of enemies : @entity3 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) pictured after their controversial november bout battle - hardened : @entity3 was looking stonefaced after his victory against @entity4 in november read why @entity3 's boxing promoter @entity12 believes a rematch between the @entity26 and @entity4 must happen this year in his new fortnightly exclusive column			1
but an offer to double his money has apparently been rejected by @entity4 , with @entity3 narrowing his future options to either a @entity4 rematch or a bout in @entity33 against @entity34			1
@entity3 said : ‘ there has been plenty of speculation over the last few weeks regarding my future			0
as it stands we are looking closely at two options @entity4 and @entity34			0
‘ yesterday ( thursday ) , we made a seven - figure offer to @entity4 for a second fight that would have seen him earn around double that of the first			1
‘ disappointingly , @entity4 rejected this offer so we are continuing our talks with @entity47 and @entity48 regarding @entity34			1
‘ i understand the demand for the @entity4 fight in the @entity51 , but also the demand in the @entity53 for the @entity34 fight			0
talks are on - going and no doubt some further news will break soon			0
i ’m happy to fight anyone , as i have done throughout my entire career			0
’ @entity4 has repeatedly called out @entity10 and @entity60 champion @entity3 for a rematch of a fight he was winning before the referee , @entity63 , intervened			1
@entity64 on friday issued a statement of his own to challenge @entity3 's version of events and the @entity10 later ordered an immediate rematch			1
cut above the rest : @entity70 ( pictured ) could be the next opponent for @entity3 he said : ' i am unsure why @entity3 has released a statement implying i do not wish to take the fight , as i was under the impression we are still in negotiations			1
the @entity78 offer in question came with many stipulations and options i felt were unsatisfactory			0
' i am currently awaiting an improved offer from his promoter , as well as speaking to other promoters interested in promoting this fight			0
' @entity4 added : ' if i did n’t want to fight @entity3 then i would n’t have invested so much time and money into appealing with the @entity10 over the dubious outcome of the first fight			1
i await the outcome of that hearing in the very near future			0
' @entity12 revealed to @entity13 that other fights under consideration for @entity3 are a rematch against @entity96 , who beat him in 2011 , and @entity97 , the middleweight world champion			0
writing on @entity98 , @entity12 said on friday : ' @entity10 call for rematch for @entity101			0
does n't change much re @entity103 's options but still hopeful of agreeing terms with @entity105			0
' possible opponents : @entity96 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right ) could be potential fights for @entity3 the @entity10 , meanwhile , said : ' after a fight our rules say a boxer has 10 days to file an appeal			1
@entity4 did that , and at a hearing on january 15 in @entity115 we had a three - man panel review all of the evidence and they came back with the decision we must order a rematch			2
' the 90 day period starts from friday , january 24 and i 'm pretty sure @entity3 will have already received notification			2
' if he fails to defend the belt against @entity4 within this period it 's more than likely he will lose his title			2
the fighters and their teams have a certain amount of time to come to an agreement and if they ca n't , it will come down to purse bids			0
' if for some reason @entity3 gave up the title then we would order the two highest - rated guys to fight for the vacant belt			2
since we already ordered @entity4 to fight @entity3 , he would be likely to be one of the guys to fight for that vacant title			1
' in that event , @entity4 would likely face the @entity10 's no 3 @entity141 .			2

@entity3 claims @entity4 rejected a seven - figure sum for a rematch
the fee was double what @entity4 received for the *duo* 's last bout
@entity10 have ordered a super-middleweight title rematch within 90 days
@entity3 also considering @entity154 as an opponent in @entity33
@entity4 says they are ' still in negotiations ' over another fight
