the astonishing spending includes five - star jaunts across the globe , the use of luxury chauffeured @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , and even private golf lessons for council staff			1
one local authority used their taxpayer - funded charge cards to buy pedicures			2
austerity ? local authorities have been exposed spending taxpayer cash on luxury trips around the world for staff the spending was uncovered by @entity29 's @entity28 ' and comes despite cash - strapped local authorities imposing deep cuts to social care and services			1
the investigation found : @entity36 secretary @entity35 slammed the high spending at a time of deepening austerity			2
he said : ' i can pretty much tell you now that money spent on golf lessons by local authorities , or pedicures , is not wisely spent			0
' not money well - spent : @entity35 mp has slammed spending on frivolous trips and luxury goods the investigation found almost 200 councils currently own or lease chauffeur cars to ferry councillors and staff , with the bill for chauffeuring top brass hitting £ 30million over five years			1
it 's the equivalent of the yearly salary of more than 1,300 new teachers , or 1,500 trainee social workers information , obtained under the @entity63 , revealed 246 chauffeur - driven cars in use across the @entity3 's councils , including 52 @entity15 , 24 bmws , 17 @entity68 , three @entity14 and a @entity69			1
the biggest spender was @entity71 , which forked out £ 983,000 on chauffeuring around its council chiefs and executives between 2007/08 and 2011/12			2
they currently use three £ 50,000 luxury @entity77 saloons			2

the deprived area of @entity86 racked up a £ 644,000 bill on chauffeur - driven cars , and runs a @entity67 7 series , a @entity67 5 series and a @entity92			1
while posh @entity93 and @entity94 , in @entity95 , spent £ 602,000 on chauffeur - driven cars , which include a @entity97 and a @entity98			1
the investigation comes as town halls face fewer controls than ever before on how cash is spent			2
councils in @entity3 are responsible for £ 114billion of taxpayers ' money - more than the entire @entity107 budget , and twice the defence budget			2
but the government has axed the @entity111 , the independent body originally set up to ensure public money is spent wisely by local authorities			0
instead , councils will be allowed to appoint their own auditors and police themselves			0
@entity116 , chair of the @entity117 , said : ' we 're worried that if local authorities appoint their own auditor that we 'll no longer have a real independent audit			0
@entity122 : one council was found to be using credit cards to pay for manicures and pedicures , while another rewarded a member of staff with golf lessons ' i think we will lose confidence that we 're getting value for money for what we put in as council taxpayers			2
' local government expert professor @entity138 , from the @entity137 , warned the loss of the independent scrutiny body could lead to council waste			0
he said : ' we will see cases of misappropriation of money , and inappropriate behaviour			0
' the investigation also revealed councils lavished £ 3.7million on globe - trotting jaunts to a total of 90 different countries between 2007/08 and 2011/12			2

the lavish spending includes money for twinning - where local authorities forge a relationship with a town or area abroad in the hope of boosting business and tourism			1
@entity93 and @entity94 , in @entity95 , spent £ 602,000 on chauffeur - driven cars , which include a @entity97 the investigation found coal - mining town @entity184 spends around £ 25,000 each year to twin with @entity187 , a medieval town in the picturesque @entity190 region of western @entity191			1
it includes a £ 23,000 salary for an ' ambassador ' to @entity184 councils also spent almost half a billion pounds on taxpayer - funded charge cards , which were used to buy golf lessons for staff members , football tickets , and pedicures			1
the charge cards , sometimes known as ' purchase cards ' or ' p - cards ' aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs of purchasing equipment for council offices and schools			2
but critics say they lack controls , and have led to extravagant spending			0
investigators found @entity213 , in @entity214 , spent £ 205 on golf lessons as a gift			1

the peer , who was jailed july 2011 for nine months after being found guilty of six charges of false accounting , but was released on an electric tag after serving just nine weeks , has defended the claims , saying his work helped save the council millions			0
despite evidence of lavish spending , mr @entity35 defended the decision to axe the independent @entity111 watchdog , saying it had started to ' lose its way '			1
@entity71 - £ 983k @entity79 - £ 704k @entity81 £ 663k @entity86 - £ 644k @entity250 - £ 602k @entity224 - £ 602k @entity251 - £ 518k @entity252 - £ 506k @entity253 - £ 484k @entity254 - £ 446k * includes drivers he said : ' if boots the chemist can appoint their own auditors , then i 'm quite sure local authorities should be able to do it , provided they do not have the same auditor all the time			0
' i think if you look around local government generally people have accepted this is what needs to be done			0
' mr @entity35 said increased openness in publishing council spending data would allow the public to keep a close eye on their councils , and ensure money is properly spent			1
he added : ' we 've also been increasing the amount of transparency			0
everything [ spent ] over £ 500 has not got to be produced and appear online			0
i 'm hoping local authorities will go down to £ 250			0
' eventually i 'm hoping they will publish everything they spend online			0
' it should n't just be the district auditors taking an interest			0
the good running of local government should be a public priority			0
' and he encouraged the public to scrutinise their own local councils			0
he said : ' i suspect this programme might well be a catalyst and we will see ' mini-me ' versions of this up and down the land			0
' ultimately you 've got to trust the public			0
ultimately it 's got to be what the public find acceptable			0
