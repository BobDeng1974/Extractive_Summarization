‘ this has been a very serious matter that has been looked at in extreme detail			0
’ @entity113 , the @entity16 church ’s public affairs director for @entity115 , said : ‘ the church occasionally receives documents like this that seek to draw attention to an individual ’s personal grievance or embarrass church leaders			1
