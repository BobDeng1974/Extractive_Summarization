by @entity1 reporter published : 09:54 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 09:55 est , 22 august 2013 these extraordinary pictures capture one of @entity5 's rarest animals - an albino squirrel			2
the red - eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast @entity8 , 66 , in a park near his home almost three months ago			1
but despite regularly stalking the woodland he was never able to capture the rare animal on camera			2
spotted : the red - eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast @entity8 , 66 , in a park near his home almost three months ago but he did n't spot it again until the other day the pensioner spent days re-stocking his bird feeder only to be greeted by half a dozen of the animals ' grey cousins			1
disappointed mr @entity8 was about to give up on ever tracking down the rare animal , but last week his luck changed			1
he glanced outside to check on his bird feeder and was stunned to see the red - eyed albino squirrel staring back at him			1
the former publisher said he was delighted to have finally caught the animal on film			2
mr @entity8 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' when we saw the white squirrel a few months ago darting through the trees , we could n't believe our eyes			1
rare : mr @entity8 said the squirrel is more nervous that other squirrels so the picture was quite difficult to take ' we thought , ' that ca n't be right '			1
they jump around , but they are gone in a flash			0
' we 've seen him a few times since then , so when we put in a bird feeder we were pleasantly surprised to see him visit			0
' he is a lot more nervous than the other squirrels , so it was not easy to get the picture			0
the feeder is mainly for the birds , but i 'm a nature lover and i 'm happy to see him			0
' though relatively uncommon , the rare creatures can be seen in a few parts of the @entity54 , and the @entity56 , in @entity55 , has its own resident albino squirrel			1
@entity58 , from the @entity56 in @entity55 , @entity59 , said : ' it 's not just squirrels that can be albinos			0
' @entity62 , badgers and even white blackbirds are not unknown in this area			0
' albinos have quite a tough time in the wild , losing any natural benefits of camouflage , or they may be rejected by others of their kind			0
' but as they are tree - dwelling and very quick on their feet , squirrels have very few natural predators and albino squirrels often survive as long as the grey ones			2
' our squirrel was cared for by @entity82 , near @entity83 , and is now too tame to release , and has been given a permanent home here			0
