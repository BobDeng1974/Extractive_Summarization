@entity0 finished bottom of @entity2 in their worst @entity4 performance for two generations			1
after being beaten by @entity7 and @entity8 and stumbling to a 0 - 0 draw with @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity6 examine what the future holds for @entity14 and his team			2
did you see any hope in the game against @entity10 ? @entity6 : @entity19 did well with balls over the top but he needs to put more chances away			0
@entity23 and @entity24 looked ok in the middle and it was good to give @entity28 experience			1
@entity29 made some good saves and could put @entity31 under some much - needed pressure			2
@entity11 : it ’s difficult to judge against a team that ’s already qualified and i did n’t learn much from the game			1
but with @entity37 and @entity38 coming to the end with @entity0 , @entity24 has an open goal to become our midfield general			1
he needs to do more , though			0
plus point : @entity19 was lively against @entity10 , but he needs to put more chances away what ’s your main memory of @entity0 ’s @entity4 ? @entity48 : frustration , more so than at any other tournament			1
we have good players but why ca n’t we motivate them ? this was not a group of death			1
there were some bang average teams in there but we finished bottom of the lot			0
with the players we have , that is an absolute failure			2
@entity62 : it ’s been tough to be an @entity64 abroad			0
in @entity67 the deflation of the fans has been obvious			0
the locals find it funny how badly @entity0 did and for the media it ’s been just as bad			1
@entity0 failed to make a mark and left themselves open to ridicule			2
tough times : it has not been easy being an @entity64 in @entity67 after the nation 's failure what one thing would you do to improve the team ? @entity62 : we need a better understanding of systems so we can change tactics and not just personnel to have an impact on games			2
other teams , such as @entity88 and @entity89 , have done that in @entity67 , but are we brave enough ? @entity48 : we have to decide how we want to play			0
@entity14 is a natural 4 - 4 - 2 coach but the current system looks uncomfortable			0
we need to stop being so easy to beat and learn to see out games			1
i ’d also like us to build a team around @entity23 for @entity94			1
@entity96 figure : @entity23 is the key to @entity0 's future who do you want to win the @entity4 now ? @entity11 : i never expected @entity0 to win it but to go out now is a low for @entity64 football , no matter how you look at it			1
i do n’t mind who wins , it ’s just good to see teams having a real go			2
@entity6 : i picked @entity108 to be top scorer and @entity67 to win it , so i ’m sticking with them			0
when the home nation does well , the tournament ignites			0
it looks like the lights at the party are flickering into life			0
yellow peril : @entity108 heads the scoring charts as @entity67 gear up for a round of 16 encounter with @entity89			0

@entity23 and @entity24 looked ok in the middle and it was good to give @entity28 experience
