papers have been filed at the @entity13 on behalf of eight people whose mothers took the anti-morning sickness drug when pregnant in the late 1950s and early 1960s , law firm @entity11 said			1
they are seeking compensation from the drug 's @entity19 maker @entity21 and @entity22 , which now owns the drug 's @entity24 distributor , @entity23 ( biochemicals )			1
among those taking action is 53 - year - old @entity1 , from @entity29 in @entity30			1
he was born with severe defects of both legs , his left ends in a stump while his right leg has just two toes			1

despite being born with a number of known thalidomide symptoms at the peak of the birth - defect epidemic , mr @entity1 has never received compensation			1
the married father - of - two said : ' i ’m very angry at the way i , and others like me , have been treated over the years			0
i have never really been given any support yet my disabilities have meant my life has been very difficult			0
' i ’m not the sort of person to let life get the better of me so i have made the most of it , i go to work and i am proud that i provide for my family			0
but it has been hard			0
' i have to wear a prosthetic leg and suffer constant pain in my legs , hips and back			1
i worry that the pain will keep getting worse and stop me from doing my job			0
' mr @entity1 was told in the 1970s that because his condition only affected his legs and not his arms that he would not be recognised as a thalidomide survivor			1
he said : ' i know i am luckier than many as i still have my arms but that does not mean i should have been ignored			0
it ’s a disgrace that so many people have been denied justice in this way			0
' in my eyes it was simply the drug companies looking to save money and ignoring the duty of care they have to people whose lives they have ruined			2
' ever since i was a child i have missed out on everyday pleasures , like playing football with friends or swimming , things other people take for granted			0
' everyday i am in pain and every day is a struggle			0
i hope that now we finally get the justice that we have been demanding for so many years			0

last year @entity22 paid 89 million @entity174 dollars ( £ 49 million ) to just over 100 further @entity174 damaged by the drug , in a deal which led to a claim against @entity21 being discontinued			1
@entity11 lawyer @entity178 said : ' @entity21 and @entity23 have always claimed that the thalidomide disaster was an unavoidable tragedy and that they did everything expected of drug companies at the time			1

' yet the drug was left on the market for many months afterwards			0
' it is time those responsible are finally held to account for the mistakes of the past			0
@entity21 , in particular , has done little make good the immense damage that it has done and it has to accept responsibility for those affected in the @entity24			2
' a @entity21 spokesman said : ' @entity21 confirms that the company received an email from @entity11 today , announcing that they have been instructed to bring proceedings on behalf of eight claimants			2
' @entity21 has not seen the claims to which they refer and is , therefore , not in a position to comment further			0
