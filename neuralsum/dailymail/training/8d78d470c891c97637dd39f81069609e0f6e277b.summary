by @entity0 a lack of social participation on @entity4 leads to people feeling less meaningful , a new study suggests			1
furthermore the less reaction people get on statuses and photographs the more excluded and invisible they feel			0
social media shunning can even lead to lower self - esteem and a sense of loss of control			1
the findings come from new research into how @entity4 impacts feelings of social belonging , affecting outlook on life , loneliness and self - worth			1
passive and shunned users - who receive no comments - feel excluded , ' invisible ' and less important and the way for regular social media users to avoid such feelings is to stay active and participate			1
the study published in the journal @entity28 was led by dr @entity29 from the @entity31 's @entity30			1
researchers conducted two studies centred on ' lurking ' - or passive - @entity4 participants , and on ostracism , aiming to analyse how people would feel when deliberately ' snubbed '			2
an initial first study looked at a group who frequently posted on @entity4			2
during the study half were actively posting participants and the other half instructed to passively observe friends ' posts and statuses			0
the study revealed that not posting for two days had a negative impact on personal well - being , @entity49 report			0
for regular social media users the way to avoid feelings of exclusion is to stay active and participate in a second study , a group used anonymous bespoke accounts in a controlled space where participants were urged to post and to comment on others ' @entity4 posts			1
however half of the group were unwittingly set up to receive no feedback whatsoever			0
in both cases , participants were interviewed on their feelings of belonging , meaningful existence , self - esteem and control after the exercise			2
the passive and shunned users both reported feeling excluded , invisible , and less important than the active users			0
shunned users also experienced lower self - esteem and control			0
with 1.11 billion users per month on average , @entity4 has become a global phenomenon offering continual and direct communication with friends and family			0
