@entity2 's @entity1 population is going to overtake the white population in only two months , according to this year 's state budget report			1
the state is also getting older , with the population of over 65s predicted to hit a boom over the coming months			0
the state has been getting more diverse for a while , but now the @entity1 population will be ' the single largest race or ethnic group ' , and it 's thought to be because most latino groups are in their prime childbearing years			1
the @entity1 community have long been the minority among the large and mixed population of @entity2 , but this year 's budget predicts that they will finally overtake the non-white @entity21 population by 0.2 per cent according to the 2013 - 2014 report , by @entity22 will make up 39 per cent of @entity2 's population of 38.2 million , and non-hispanic whites will make up 38.8 per cent			1
this means that @entity1 population outstrips the white population by around only 76,400 people			1
this change was actually predicted to happen seven moths ago , but @entity1 birth rates were lower than predicted			0
the figures from last years budget show that the gap is closing between the two demographic groups			2
@entity1 population campaign for equal rights outside of @entity2 state house in the demographic report for 2011 - 2012 whites made up 40 per cent of @entity2 's population and @entity42 made up 39 per cent			1
this is dramatically different to 25 years ago , where whites made up around 57 per cent of @entity2 's population and @entity22 only made up around 26 per cent			2
the report , which in addition to detailing @entity2 's annual budget , predicts social and demographic trends , also predicted that the @entity2 has an ageing population			2
the number of residents aged 65 and older will rise by 20.7 per cent over the next five years , and 18 - 45 year - olds will suffer a 4.5 per cent decline , as over 1,000 @entity2 turn 65 every day			1
this change in the majority ethnicity and the average state age is thought to have severe impacts on the democratic changes to @entity2 over the next 15 years			2
@entity60 , director of the @entity61 said : ' demographic changes that are coming will reshape the electorate			0
the median age of the @entity1 population has reached 28 , which are said to be prime childbearing years , and is thought to be the reason for @entity1 population overtaking the non-white hispanic population ' in turn that will likely have impacts on policies and issues that decision makers focus on in the coming decades ' ' a big question mark is about what that means for policy for youth			1
' older voters often are n't as supportive of youth - specific policies			0
' in addition , @entity83 groups are predicted to rise from a current 13 per cent , but because of immigration rather than increased birthing rates			0
@entity87 , spokesman for the @entity89 institute , a group that advocates for communities of colour , said that the government and private sector both need to adapt to these predictions			0
he said : ' it 's less about one group being a couple tenths more of the population than another group , but more about a continuing trend for @entity2 being a majority - minority state ' ' everything that government does , that private industry does , needs to react to that reality			0
' overall , the state , that has had steady growth over the last economic year , is predicted to have a 300,000 population rise by july of 2014 .			0

by @entity1 population will outstrip the white population by over *70,000*
change because many @entity22 are now reaching prime childbearing years
gap is closing between the two demographic groups
@entity2 is becoming more diverse , as the @entity83 population rises
the state is getting older as around 1,000 people turn 65 every day
changes might have *significant* effects on democratic changes
