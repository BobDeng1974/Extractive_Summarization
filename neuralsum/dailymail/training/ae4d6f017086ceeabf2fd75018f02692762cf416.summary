by @entity1 reporter published : 17:31 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 17:31 est , 9 january 2013 @entity3 officials blamed the @entity5 government for a series of coordinated hacking attacks that targeted @entity3 banks			1
the hackers purposefully targeted bank databases and flooded their systems causing major disruptions and even complete shutdowns of company networks			0
no money was stolen and no individual accounts were breached as the hacks were merely meant to disrupt business for the banks , which officials say is a trademark of a government - lead attack			2
targeted : a series of cyber attacks have disrupted service to the data centers for a long list of @entity3 - based banks like @entity29 , but because they only effected the websites and did not steal money , officials believe they were government - backed ' there is no doubt within the @entity3 government that @entity5 is behind these attacks , ' former state department official @entity33 told @entity38			1
distrust : @entity3 officials believe that the hacks were approved by @entity5 government forces , headed by @entity42 mr @entity33 , who now works as a computer security expert at the @entity44 , says that the unparalleled to any prior government - backed attacks			1
though the attacks have been kept relatively quiet - largely because the lack of stolen funds caused little concern to individual bank users - a shocking amount of financial institutions have been targeted			0
so far , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 have all been disrupted			0
a hacking group named @entity64 ad - @entity62 claimed responsibility for the attacks in an online message board , but the @entity3 government says that group is simply a puppet organization run by the @entity5 government			1
government - on - government virtual attacks are not unheard of , and the @entity3 has actually perpetrated their own against @entity5 in the past			2
according to a different @entity38 story , the @entity3 teamed up with @entity76 in 2010 to target the computer facilities at a @entity5 nuclear facility			0
@entity5 government officials deny having any connection to the latest string of attacks , saying that they would not stoop to the @entity3 's level			1
excuse ? the hacking group that claimed responsibility for the attacks said that they were done because the @entity3 government refuses to completely remove the offensive @entity88 film made by @entity89 ( center ) ' unlike the @entity3 , which has per reports in the media given itself the license to engage in illegal cyber-warfare against @entity5 , @entity5 respects the international law and refrains from targeting other nations â€™ economic or financial institutions , ' @entity91 , an @entity5 - @entity92 envoy , told @entity38			1
in the online post which boasts of plotting the attacks , @entity64 ad - @entity62 say that the attacks are due to the @entity3 government 's refusal to remove an @entity107 film from the internet			2
' but the american profiteer rulers ' insistence and persistence in disregarding this reasonable demand of all @entity114 of the world and not taking an action to remove this offensive film shows these tyrants insist that continue to insult @entity121 saints , ' the group wrote in a document on hacker - friendly site @entity123			0
@entity3 officials differ , however , saying that it simply a ruse and the true reason is the continued implementation of economic and political sanctions against @entity5 .			0

@entity3 banks targeted in string of disruptive hacking attacks
because no money was stolen , officials believe it was a coordinated attack approved by the @entity5 government , though they deny any connection
