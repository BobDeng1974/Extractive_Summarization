a public - spirited father was fined for his kindness as he reunited a lost terrier with its owner - because he unknowingly waited on playing fields from which dogs were banned			1
@entity6 spotted the missing pet , called @entity8 , wandering the streets of @entity10 , @entity11 and found a number for the owner on its collar			1
but after arranging to meet the owner in a nearby playing field , mr @entity6 was approached by dog wardens who quickly handed him an £ 85 penalty fine			1
@entity6 was left furious after he was handed a fine by ' horrible ' dog wardens as he waited to return a lost terrier to its rightful owner mr @entity6 said : ' i feel penalised for doing the right thing			1
i was worried it might get knocked over			0
i called the phone number on the collar but could n't get an answer at first			2
' i was only there two or three minutes and i 'd just got through to the owner when the dog wardens came on and said " you ca n't walk your dog there "			1
' they were quite horrible about it			0
i was never given the opportunity to explain myself			0
now i 've got to pay £ 85 and i feel like i did the dog wardens ' jobs for them			1
' mr @entity6 had been walking with partner @entity43 , nine - month - old son @entity44 , and his own dog @entity45 when he saw the lost animal running free			1
his partner took @entity44 and @entity45 to their car , while mr @entity6 called the number on the dog 's collar			1
he said he did not realise dogs were banned from the site because he was not local to the area and so waited there for the owner to turn up and retrieve their pet			1
he said : ' i do n't live down there so i did n't know it was restricted walking			0
i did n't want to put the dog in the car with @entity44 so i walked over to a nearby field			2
' i said " this is ridiculous "			0
i had the baby in my arms so i left the dog with them and walked off			0
' owner @entity71 has backed mr @entity6 's explanation and called on @entity73 to overturn the fine			2
the terrier , @entity8 , had run away from its disabled owner 's house when a visitor arrived at the front door mr @entity71 , who is disabled , said his dog @entity8 had run out of the house into the road as his carer came through the door			1
he said : ' i 'd like to thank mr @entity6 and why they have charged him i do n't know			0
' i did n't know that he had been fined			0
the dog wardens know me , they told me everything was all right			1
' he was only in that field because it was the easiest place for me to pick @entity8 up			0
i 'd go to court and vouch for him if need be			0
' @entity73 said : ' the council is unable to comment on the specifics of individual cases			0
' @entity95 is leased by a youth football club , who have previously experienced a persistent problem with dog fouling that was severely affecting their use of the field			2
' the field has been recently fenced off , which has resulted in it becoming a dog exclusion area			2
' mr @entity6 said he was unaware of the rules as he is not from the area and was concerned with looking after his son , @entity44 , and the dog he was helping to retrieve at the time			0

@entity110 found missing terrier running free in @entity10 , @entity11
he kept hold of it and phoned the owner , whose number was on the collar
but while he waited for owner to arrive , dog wardens *swooped* on him
