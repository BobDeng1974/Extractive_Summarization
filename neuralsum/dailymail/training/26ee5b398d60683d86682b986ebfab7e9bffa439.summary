still smiling : @entity6 was diagnosed with infantile fibrosarcoma when she was just seven weeks old delighted : mother @entity18 , 30 , puts @entity6 's amazing recovery down to her ability to be endlessly cheerful terrifying operation : the little girl had an operation in august to remove the tumour from her back , along with three ribs and part of her lung her relieved parents @entity18 , 30 , and @entity30 , 32 , today put their cheerful daughter 's remarkable recovery down to her naturally sunny disposition			1
they are now looking forward to celebrating her first birthday free from the fear that has affected @entity6 's entire childhood so far			1
the little girl seemed perfectly healthy when she was born , weighing 8lbs 2oz , on january 7 , but her mother soon noticed she was not feeding properly			0
when @entity6 was just three weeks old , mrs @entity6 felt a lump on her back and immediately took her to the gp			1
she was referred to the @entity40 in @entity8 , where doctors discovered a 7.5cm - long tumour growing from the tenth rib on the right - hand side of the baby 's back			0
shocking discovery : the tumour in the little girl 's back was 7.5cm long when her mother found it three weeks into her life , before doctors spotted six more lumps in her lungs an ultrasound showed the tumour had blood vessels and @entity58 and mrs @entity6 were told it was cancerous			1
they also found a staggering six tumours in @entity6 ’s lungs			1
fortunately , seven gruelling months of chemotherapy killed them and shrank the tumour in her back to 2cm so that doctors could remove it			1
in august , she had drastic surgery at @entity66 in @entity67 to remove the tumour along with three ribs and part of her right lung			1
cheerful @entity6 beamed happily throughout the painful cancer - killing treatment , despite coming frighteningly close to death in may			1
mother - of - four mrs @entity6 said : ' @entity6 has been absolutely amazing throughout her whole illness			1
' people in the hospital would often comment that she hardly ever cried and she was always smiling			0
' it was a real comfort for @entity30 and i to see her smiling - it kept us going			0
@entity6 is such a happy little girl			2
absolute trooper : in may , @entity6 began bleeding from the nose after having an adverse reaction to the chemotherapy and nearly dying ' i can not put in to words how happy i am that @entity6 has been given the all clear			1
only now have i started to feel hopeful			0
' now we can hopefully have a normal family life and look forward to @entity6 ’s first birthday			2
' @entity6 ’s illness has been really hard for the whole family			2
she has missed out on family events as we had to make sure she did not catch anything as her immune system was low			0
' my sister even had to miss my 30th birthday as she had a cold sore and could not be near @entity6			2
' @entity6 needed nine cycles of chemotherapy starting on march 13 and had to have blood transfusions to help with her anaemia			1
in may , she started bleeding from her nose and was transferred to @entity66			0
specialist found she was having an adverse reaction to the chemotherapy which had poisoned her liver and she nearly died from hepatic veno - occlusive disease			0
but @entity6 pulled through - her last chemotherapy session was on october 18 and her latest tests have all come back clear			1
the worry is over : giggling @entity6 has now pulled through and been given the all - clear at nine months she has now tentatively been given the all - clear by medics , although she will still have to be monitored with three - monthly check - ups			1
@entity114 is looking forward to playing with her older brothers ten - year - old @entity116 , @entity117 , six , and @entity118 , three			0
mrs @entity6 added : ' as soon as i felt the lump i knew it was not right			2
@entity6 was as white a chalk			2
' when you hear the word cancer you think death			0
i thought " what have i done to deserve this ? " ' if i could have died in that room i would have			0
i wanted a little girl so much after having three boys so i was devastated when i found out something was wrong with @entity6			2
' i knew it was serious			0
after we found out we put @entity6 in the car and @entity30 and i stood outside while i cried and cried			1
' i pleaded with the doctors to save my little girl			0
the consultant oncologist dr @entity136 was brilliant and said " my aim is to save her " , and she has worked a miracle			0
' during @entity6 ’s treatment i planned her funeral in my head			2
i knew which songs she was going to have and i started planning what i would say			0
' that is all i could do			0
i did not think there would be an end			0
' now we have her back			0
