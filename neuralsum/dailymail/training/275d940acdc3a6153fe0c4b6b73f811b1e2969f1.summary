@entity0 is bringing back its famous interracial family for a @entity3 ad in the cereal 's first spot during the game in eight years			2
the @entity8 cereal company stirred controversy when they released the ad last year featuring bi-racial actress @entity11 , prompting the company to permanently disable comments on the video 's @entity15 page after several racist reactions			1
but overall the ad was extremely successful and most came out to defend @entity0 ' depiction of a diverse @entity21 family			2
as of wednesday the original ad had garnered over 74,000 likes on @entity15 compared to less than 3,000 dislikes			1
this latest ad has her talking to her dad about getting a new baby brother precocious : after learning that she 's getting a new baby brother , @entity11 gets her dad to agree to getting her a dog the first ad shows little @entity11 going up to her white mom seated at the kitchen table , asking her if @entity0 are really good for your heart			1
her mom says the whole grains can help lower cholesterol and @entity11 shuffles away mischievously			1
the next shot shows her black dad waking up from a nap on the couch with a mound of cereal on his chest			0
in the new ad released tuesday , @entity11 is at the table with @entity51 this time as he explains ( using @entity0 of course ) how she will soon be getting a baby brother			1
the precocious little girl uses the @entity0 like chips and raises her father 's one baby to a dog as well and he agrees			0
curious : the original @entity0 ad showed @entity11 asking her mom about the heart health benefits of the cereal heart healthy : the girl 's while mother tells her about the benefits of @entity0 before @entity11 scurries off mysteriously surprise ! the next shot shows @entity11 's dad waking up from a couch with a mound of @entity0 on his chest ' @entity73 is about families and love and connections and breakfast , ' said @entity78 , vp of marketing for @entity81 cereals , on the @entity8 corporate blog			1
' our new @entity0 ad celebrates one of those special moments in a family that @entity21 fell in love with			0
the ad quietly celebrates the emotional sharing and simple joys we find when spending just a few simple moments together every day			0
' some criticized the ad and it 's sequel because they believe @entity8 is exploiting race to sell cereal			0
but @entity97 , the executive creative director at @entity98 , the ad agency that produced the commercial , does n't agree			0
' if we ’re milking anything , ' he told the @entity104 , ' it ’s this delightful little actress ... a little girl ’s special relationship with her dad			2

the company permanently disabled comments on the video *streaming* site , but the ad was overall beloved
in the new ad , @entity11 *propositions* her dad to get a dog
