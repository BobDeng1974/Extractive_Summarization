a task force which includes the combined resources of the @entity2 , @entity4 , @entity5 and territory police has seized crystal meth with a street value of close to $ 1 billion in less than two years - and yet it 's barely put a dent in the ' ice pandemic ' at least 25 organised crime gangs have been broken up , three major commercial drug laboratories shut down and members of a @entity15 cartel were recently arrested			1
but new figures revealed by the @entity3 to @entity17 show that in the past few months , the production , importation and use of ' ice ' has gone to another level			2
and the criminal involvement is not restricted to local manufacturers and distributors			0
' the fact that @entity27 illicit drug users pay a premium price for most illicit drugs compared to prices in key foreign markets , makes @entity27 an attractive market for manufacture and importation of methylamphetamine , ' mr @entity35 said			1
to illustrate how bad the problem has become , the @entity3 produced figures comparing the first year of the national task force against the latest available for the first quarter of this financial year			1
the disturbing increase of ' ice ' production and use in @entity27			1
the @entity2 reports that the national task force focusing on illicit drugs and money laundering has found crystal meth is now at ' pandemic ' proportions from the year january 2013 to the following january in 2014 , more than 530 kilograms , worth more than half a billion dollars was intercepted by the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
but in the past two months alone , the same union of @entity27 agencies has closed the net on several syndicates attempting to get up to 350 kilograms of the illicit substance on the streets			1
across the last week of july , a joint operation across @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity34 and @entity82 resulted in the seizure of more than 220 kilograms of illicit drugs , the majority of that haul was ' ice '			1
it means law enforcement agencies are getting results but they 're having to come up with different strategies			0
and while authorities would not be drawn , there are suggestions that officers are being more regularly embedded as operatives within gangs			0
' with its relative accessibility , affordability and destructive side - effects , crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the @entity103 ' says @entity35 the @entity3 's list of side - effects of ' ice ' include ; psychosis , paranoia , anxiety , depression , decreased memory , violent streaks , risk of heart failure and stroke a task force which includes the combined resources of the @entity2 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity118 police has seized crystal meth with a street value of close to $ 1 billion in less than two years mr @entity35 said only that ' non-traditional law enforcement measures aimed at disrupting and deterring organised crime groups have been used '			1
' we 've been better able to unearth an elaborate network			0
' the main detections at the @entity27 border have originated from @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 in numbers but @entity15 and @entity131 by weight			1
@entity133 produced meth have begun making its way in and increasing numbers are being tracked from @entity138 crime groups			2
in a submission to @entity140 the @entity3 stated that ' organised crime groups which may have traditionally focused on importing particular illicit drugs , for example heroin or cocaine , have commenced importing multiple illicit commodities , particularly methylamphetamine '			2
the @entity3 boss labelled this ' an emerging pandemic '			0
' with its relative accessibility , affordability and destructive side - effects , crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the @entity156			2
' more than 100,000 people were arrested on drug - related charges in @entity27 in the year 2012 - 13 mr @entity35 also warned that international crime syndicates are now competing with traditional producers ( in some cases they have joined forces ) for a piece of the local ' ice ' market			1
' no one criminal syndicate , crime group or ethnicity - based group is dominant in the methylamphetamine market , ' he said			0
' the methylamphetamine market is sufficiently diverse and profitable to support a large number of competing and sometimes collaborating suppliers , at different levels of sophistication			0
' there is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market			2
' the @entity3 say ' there is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market ' tougher still for authorities , because of the lucrative nature of the ' ice ' trade , criminals are now joining forces ' at different stages of the methylamphetamine supply chain , or to collaborate on an importation or local supply '			1
@entity196 comes in four forms normally being tablet , crystal , base ( or paste ) and powder			0
' the increase in imports ( of the drug ) does not appear to have coincided with a decrease in local production			0
' according to the @entity208 , methylamphetamine accounts for more than 70 per cent of global amphetamine - type stimulants ( @entity212 ) seizures			0
the @entity3 warning that ' border detections and domestic seizures are at record levels			0
the @entity27 market remains robust and is likely expanding ' .			0

the first quarter of this financial year has produced record numbers of seizures and arrests across @entity27
the @entity24 has captured more than $ 350 million worth of ' ice ' in less than three months
one of the largest single seizures was 135 kilograms of methylamphetamine in @entity228 occurred in late july
more than 100 kilograms of drugs was found in a *shipment* of fish in @entity233
@entity15 , @entity128 and @entity127 cartels now firmly established in @entity27 drug trade
one point of crystal meth ( 100 *milligrams* ) can cost users about $ 100
it 's estimated at least half a million @entity27 are ice users or have used the drug
