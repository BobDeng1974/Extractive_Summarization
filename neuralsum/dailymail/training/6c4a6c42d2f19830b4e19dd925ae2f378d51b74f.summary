@entity1 lawyers have been given tablet computers riddled with problems in a £ 5 million deal branded ‘ a shambles ’			1
the @entity1 bought 4,700 of the tablets at £ 865 each to allow prosecutors to do away with bundles of paper in court			1
but the devices could not show video evidence , so another £ 102,000 had to be spent on dvd players			2
controversy : the @entity1 has spent £ 5million on tablet computers ( file photo ) @entity1 staff complain that the computers are too heavy to hold through long hearings			1
prosecutors also say it is harder to flick through documents on the gadgets than in physical folders and that batteries can run out at crucial moments in trials			0
another £ 1.5 million has been spent on software support and maintenance over the past two years , taking the total bill to more than £ 5.5 million			2
shadow attorney general @entity30 , who uncovered the spending spree in a series of parliamentary questions , told @entity34 : ‘ ministers have inflicted unprecedented cuts and upheaval on the @entity1 in recent years , and the result appears to be poor decision - making and false economies			1
‘ if these tablets are n’t even fit for purpose , then that is a shambles			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ digital working will eliminate the vast majority of paperwork and the wasted time and expense that comes with it			2
' electronic case files can now be transferred instantly between police , prosecutors and many magistrates ’ courts , saving the cost of printing this information and the inconvenience of carrying heavy case files to court			0
‘ our tablets enable prosecutors to efficiently present these cases in court			0
inevitably some initial investment is needed to modernise the criminal justice system , but the long - term benefits and savings will outweigh this initial cost			0
