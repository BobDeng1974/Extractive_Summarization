@entity1 manager @entity0 joked @entity2 looks more natural with a ball at his feet than without it after the 20 - year - old made an inspirational comeback at @entity8			1
the @entity10 midfielder is not just a huge talent , conservatively valued at £ 40million , he is also a talisman and leader for his club			0
having suffered knee ligament damage in pre-season , he showed remarkable fizz and energy in his first outing of the season to lift senior colleagues who had started the weekend on the fringes of the relegation zone			1
@entity0 ’s smile was only matched by that of @entity83 ’s assistant @entity82 , who will surely tell the @entity10 boss to pencil in @entity2 ’s name for the next @entity88 qualifier , against @entity89			1
‘ i did n’t think there was any way eight days ago @entity2 could have started this game			2
but he ’s been phenomenal in the last week and when he curled one in the top corner in training , it was a message to me , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ it was like he ’d been involved in every game this season			0
you ask yourself if he was born to play football			0
he looks more natural with a ball than without it			0
as humans , that ’s not right ! ’ @entity1 had not won in their previous three @entity106 games but @entity2 brought the feel - good factor rushing back with an audacious shot that was tipped around the post by @entity54			1
from the following short corner , @entity76 turned @entity60 inside - out and delivered the perfect cross , right - footed for once , for @entity38 to head in			2
the 32 - year - old skipper did not score at all for @entity1 last season but now has three in six games for club and country , including a @entity118 derby classic and a @entity120 goal against @entity121			2
@entity23 boss @entity122 , who gave @entity66 his first start since march , accepted his side were second - best			1
‘ we did n’t deserve anything out of the game , ’ he conceded			0
the only surprise was it took @entity1 until the 48th minute to extend their lead			2
@entity2 played in @entity46 with the outside of his boot and @entity54 let his shot squeeze through his hands			1
with the game won , @entity0 hooked the ‘ sensational ’ @entity2 , though he admitted the player looked fresh and would have carried on if asked			1
@entity1 did not need him by that stage			2
@entity26 ran across @entity59 to hook in another @entity76 cross for 3 - 0 after 76 minutes			2
‘ a ridiculous goal to give away , ’ said @entity122			0
@entity1 were given a boost before kick - off with star midfielder @entity2 returning to the starting line - up after a knee injury @entity23 manager @entity122 ( left ) and his assistant @entity144 were hoping to end a run of three consecutive defeats @entity23 striker @entity65 takes a tumble under pressure from @entity41 ( left ) and @entity26 @entity38 gets on the end of a @entity76 cross to put the @entity1 1 - 0 ahead after 17 minutes @entity1 centre back @entity38 is congratulated by @entity2 and @entity76 ( left ) after scoring the opener at @entity8 @entity1 keeper @entity36 barks some orders to his defence as @entity1 look to defend their early 1 - 0 lead @entity156 on striker @entity42 ( right ) vies for possession with @entity23 's @entity56 @entity1 substitute @entity43 makes a run as @entity23 midfielder @entity63 watches on @entity61 tries to controle possession but is put under pressure from @entity1 left back @entity76 @entity0 seemed as pleased with the clean sheet as anything else			1
‘ we have n’t been solid enough in defence this season but today we had that right intensity			0
we stopped @entity23 being a threat and that is an incredible achievement against a team with @entity66 and @entity65 , ’ he said			1
he knows he has a special talent on his hands in @entity2			0
‘ normally players either have good technical ability or good physical ability			0
he has both , ’ said the @entity172			0
for @entity23 , it is back to the drawing board			0
‘ @entity63 and @entity55 were good but you ca n’t win games with only two of them , ’ added @entity122			0
@entity46 doubles @entity1 's advantage in the 48th - minute with his left footed shot from the left side of the box @entity187 international @entity46 celebrates with @entity2 in front of the @entity8 faithful @entity23 keeper @entity54 retrieves the ball from the back of his net after @entity46 's second - half strike @entity194 miles @entity1 108.6 67.5 @entity40 90 11.6 7.2 @entity45 90 11.6 7.2 @entity41 90 10.7 6.6 @entity23 108.4 67.3 @entity60 90 12.2 7.6 @entity63 90 11.6 7.2 @entity64 90 10.9 6.8			1
