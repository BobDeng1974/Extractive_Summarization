from the endless chocolate blocks passed around the office , to the glaring supermarket aisles and the family relatives who miraculously appear with baskets of eggs , @entity0 can be a minefield to navigate if you 're trying to watch your waistline			0
but according to new research , there 's no need to go easy on the eggs this week , with a @entity15 study revealing there is no direct connection between chocolate consumption and an increasing @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
this should come as sweet relief for chocoholics when according to @entity15 , two thirds of @entity21 admit to munching on chocolate at least once a month			1
the research lead by @entity15 discovered while 67 per cent of @entity21 adults agree that they restrict how much fattening food they eat , they still will sneak some kind of chocolate into their diet over a four week period and 74 per cent will consume it at least once in a month			1
interestingly , 68 per cent of those who ticked the ‘ i ’m constantly watching my weight ’ statement and the ‘ prefer to eat healthy snacks ’ still meet the once a month quota			0
the results also indicated there is n't one demographic in @entity21 who eat the most chocolate - there are a variety of groups with chocoholic tendencies			2
firstly , those who ‘ tend to snack throughout the day ’ were considered by far the most susceptible chocolate consumers			0
also those considered underweight were just as likely to eat chocolate in four weeks as those who were overweight ( with overweight scoring slightly higher )			2
munch for mood : chocolate has also been proven to boost your mood and reduce stress levels this research only adds to the reputation amongst medical studies that now suggest chocolate is good for you in a myriad of ways			1
it 's been found to help your heart by reducing the risk of atherosclerosis ( thickening and hardening of the arteries ) , boost your brain power by enhancing blood flow to the brain ( associated with enhancing memory ) and also reduces stress levels by correcting chemical imbalances related with stress			1
so as for those @entity96 bunnies ? eat away , your body will thank you			0
a previous version of this article made reference to a @entity102 study which claimed a link between cocoa diets and weight loss			0
we have removed this reference as the study was subsequently revealed to be incorrect .			0

new research from @entity15 reveals there 's no proof that chocolate consumption affects @entity19
currently two thirds of @entity21 eat chocolate at least once a month
chocolate also found to *benefit* brain , heart and stress levels
