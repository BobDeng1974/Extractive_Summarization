by @entity0 prince @entity1 in uniform : the @entity1 has spoken publicly for the first time of how he saved a @entity6 ship from a @entity8 bomber in 1943 his comrades saw it as a courageous act that saved dozens of lives			1
to prince @entity1 , however , it was nothing more than a ‘ frightfully good wheeze ’			1
the @entity1 has spoken publicly for the first time of how he saved a @entity6 ship from a @entity8 bomber in 1943			1
and the 93 - year - old was typically phlegmatic about his exploits			2
he told how the destroyer he was serving on during the @entity24 invasion of @entity25 was spotted by a @entity27 plane that looked certain to sink it			2
the @entity1 , who was second in command of @entity31 , foiled the attack by launching a burning life - raft from the ship			1
the @entity8 pilot attacked the raft , allowing the destroyer to escape			2
prince @entity1 told @entity38 : ‘ we did some patrolling along the coast of @entity25 and one night for some reason or another some @entity8 bomber decided they could see us , and so they thought they would have a go			1
‘ i thought it was a frightfully good wheeze			2
i got a @entity49 float , filled it with rubbish and set fire to it and launched it hoping that the aeroplane would think we were burning			2
it went and had a go at it			2
we got away with it			2
’ in 2003 , one of the @entity1 ’s comrades – former yeoman @entity57 – remembered the same attack , and described the crew ’s fear and certainty they would be killed			1
he said : ‘ prince @entity1 saved our lives that night			1
i suppose there might have been a few survivors , but certainly the ship would have been sunk			0
he was always very courageous and resourceful and thought very quickly			0
‘ you would say to yourself “ what the hell are we going to do now ? ” and @entity1 would come up with something			1
’ in his interview this week , prince @entity1 also spoke about his involvement in the @entity73 , where @entity6 warships destroyed @entity76 cruisers off the @entity78 coast in 1941			1
then aged 19 , he was a humble midshipman in charge of picking out enemy ships in the darkness using the spotlight aboard @entity83			0
describing the moment they crept up on the @entity76 fleet , he said : ‘ i could see them because @entity89 the destroyer switched on her searchlight before we did , and so i could actually see the outline of these ships before somebody said “ open shutters ”			0
fortunately it was pointing in the right direction at the time			0
‘ the interesting thing that struck me was that it was so close – you know those big searchlights , colossal great things – it only lit up half one of the @entity76 cruisers			0
they said “ train left ”			0
‘ i found the other one and it lit up the middle part of it , whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15inch shells at point blank range			0
’ an informal shot of the @entity1 whilst in the @entity6 : the @entity1 , who was second in command of @entity31 , foiled the attack by launching a burning life - raft from the which the @entity8 pilot attacked instead @entity31 : ' i got a @entity49 float , filled it with rubbish and set fire to it and launched it hoping that the aeroplane would think we were burning			1
it went and had a go at it			0
we got away with it , ' he said prince @entity1 was mentioned in despatches after the battle by the fleet ’s commander - in - chief , admiral sir @entity131			1
he was later awarded the @entity133			0
the @entity1 may now be accustomed to all the luxury of life in @entity136			1
but his account of his war years reveals he was once used to much more menial tasks			0
he recalled : ‘ on the way to the invasion of @entity25 , we were pulled off the east coast convoys and sent out and went into @entity144 , and i optimistically thought i could get some spuds for the ship , and i went ashore			0
‘ people said “ do n’t you realise there ’s been a siege ? ” i managed to get a couple of bags of spuds but it was the only fresh stuff we could get			0
’ after the war prince @entity1 was promoted to lieutenant - commander and was given command of frigate @entity159 , where he was nicknamed ‘ @entity162 ’ by his men			1
he married the then princess @entity163 in 1947 and his @entity6 career came to an end a few years later when she became @entity163 .			0
