by @entity0 @entity1 was not known as a gourmet - but she may have helped @entity3 become the culinary capital of @entity5 , according to a leading chef			2
@entity8 - starred restaurateur @entity7 claims that his home country of @entity10 is falling behind the @entity3 thanks to its use of pre-packaged ingredients and microwaved meals			1
he blames the decline on @entity17 regulations which limit the number of hours chefs can work - and credits @entity1 with stopping @entity3 going the same way			1
warning : @entity7 says that @entity10 's culinary scene is in decline thanks to employment laws mr @entity7 , 73 , moved to @entity3 nearly half a century ago , and along with his brother @entity24 set up two of the country 's best restaurants , @entity28 in @entity29 and the @entity30 in @entity31			1
he is therefore well placed to compare the culinary tradition of @entity10 with that of the @entity3 - and his firm opinion is that the @entity10 are set to lose their world domination			0
a combination of @entity10 working time laws and @entity5 regulations mean that most workers in @entity10 are restricted to working 35 hours a week , which is a far cry from the exhausting hours traditionally worked by chefs			1
according to mr @entity7 , this means that @entity10 restaurants are forced to take shortcuts to get round the problem of shorter working hours			2
saviour : mr @entity7 says that @entity1 's refusal to introduce legislation rescued @entity3 restaurants ' when the food comes in the morning , you have to unwrap it , clean it , store it , prepare it properly , ' he told the @entity58			1
' in those hours , you ca n't do that			0
' so restaurants are buying food which is either pre-cooked , vacuum - packed or frozen			0
instead of having three or four chefs in a bistro , they have one who can open a baguette and put food in the microwave			0
' he added : ' chefs work long hours , some up to 50 hours in five days			0
does it hurt them ? do they feel worse ? they are proud of their job and what they 're doing			0
' in @entity10 , they 've lost it			0
how can you be proud of doing your job reheating food out of packets ? ' achievement : mr @entity7 founded the @entity30 , one of the best restaurants in the @entity3 @entity3 has repeatedly sought to opt out of @entity17 employment legislation under leaders including @entity1 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
asked whether he thought @entity1 was responsible for @entity3 's culinary rise , mr @entity7 replied : ' my @entity94 , she saved the country ! ' although he still visits @entity10 every month , he told the @entity58 he now avoids bistros and brasseries because the average standard has fallen so far			1
despite mr @entity7 's outburst , there are still far more restaurants in @entity10 which are considered world - class than there are in @entity3			2
just four @entity3 restaurants - including the @entity30 - hold three @entity8 stars , compared to 26 in @entity10 .			0

founder of @entity28 and @entity30 says his home country is now *dependent* on pre-packaged ingredients
he blames the shift on rules which block chefs working more than 35 hours
@entity1 refused to introduce *similar* legislation in @entity3
' my @entity94 , she saved the country ' says mr @entity7 , 73
