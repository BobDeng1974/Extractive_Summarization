@entity0 has ruled out returning to @entity1 , becoming the final presenter to leave the motoring show as he vowed : ' i wo n't quit my mates '			1
in yet another major blow to the @entity8 , the presenter took to @entity9 to reveal he would not be returning to the hugely - popular series			1
the announcement came as the show 's former executive producer @entity12 launched a scathing attack on ' meddling @entity8 executives ' in a @entity17 editorial , published today			1
yesterday , mr @entity12 , who is a childhood friend of @entity18 , sensationally quit @entity20 - fuelling speculation that the team is gearing up to launch a similar show with a rival broadcaster			1
the men were also seen holding talks at @entity18 's west @entity27 home , in their first public appearance since the presenter was axed from the show over a ' fracas ' with a producer			1
not about to quit my mates anyway			0
' @entity17 , which is owned by @entity64 , today published an editorial by mr @entity12 , in which the producer branded the decision to sack @entity18 a ' tragedy '			1
he said : ‘ [ the @entity8 ] has n’t just lost a man who can hold viewers ’ attention in front of a camera , it ’s lost a journalist who could use the discipline of print training to focus on what mattered and what did n’t , it ’s lost an editorial genius who could look at an existing structure and then smash it up and reshape it in a blaze of light bulb moments ’			2
he said chiefs at the corporation also originally vetoed hiring may , claiming the three were all ‘ middle - class public - schoolish blokes of a similar age ’			0
the astonishing feature ends speculation as to the reasons behind mr @entity12 's decision to quit the @entity8 - which was announced by corporation bosses yesterday evening			1
mr @entity12 also criticised attempts by the @entity8 to second - guess decisions about @entity1 's return in 2002 despite not being interested in the show ’s subject matter			1
he said : ‘ the @entity8 grown - ups were adamant a woman should be in the line - up			2
' now , i 'm a big , big fan of the @entity8 , but , my @entity104 , do they stretch your patience when they start “ applying their marketing logic ” , or to use another word , meddling			1
@entity18 - who is a childhood friend of mr @entity12 - and his friends appeared to be reading something in the pub night out : @entity18 ( pictured at the pub last night ) was sacked from the @entity8 after his ' fracas ' with @entity1 producer @entity117 mr @entity12 , who is a childhood friend of @entity18 ( pictured with @entity0 and may yesterday ) , also branded the @entity8 ’s decision to sack the presenter a ‘ tragedy ’ mr @entity12 said the @entity8 originally vetoed having @entity18 , @entity0 ( pictured shaking hands yesterday ) and may as the @entity1 line - up ‘ their theory behind a female presenter was that if you want women to watch something , you need women presenting it			1
' the problem was that most of the grown - ups in the @entity8 management did n't care about the car world , and basically there 's this weird logic whereby the less their interest is in the subject , the greater their compulsion becomes to meddle			2
’ mr @entity12 sensationally resigned from the @entity8 yesterday , following a meeting with the three former presenters at @entity18 's flat in west @entity27			1
it means he is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel , in what would be a nightmare scenario for the corporation			0
@entity18 , who presented the original @entity1 series up until 2001 , and mr @entity12 auditioned a series of women for the role but eventually refused to compromise on their vision of their programme			1
the producer said : ‘ [ we ] had already started to realise that bloke banter was going to become an important part of the show ’			2
they pitched the new - look programme to @entity163 , then head of @entity164 , as a ‘ journey into that massive black hole that is the male brain ’ , complete with all - male presenting line up			0
@entity163 , who now runs an independent production company , said she had no problem with the lack of a woman , which mr @entity12 said displays ‘ a classic case of @entity8 management playing their favourite game of @entity175			1
’ even after winning this battle , the pair faced further problems trying to hire the team they wanted			0
the @entity8 said the @entity18 , 55 , @entity0 , 45 , and may , 52 , were ‘ a bit cheese and cheese ’ , meaning they were too similar in age and background			1
bosses blocked may ’s appointment , instead opting for @entity188 , who mr @entity12 points out ‘ was fairly middle - class and of a similar age ’			2
he was replaced by may the following series			0
mr @entity12 , a childhood friend of @entity18 ( pictured meeting yesterday ) , said the @entity8 pressured the pair to hire a female presenter @entity18 , @entity0 and may could reunite with @entity12 to start a new motoring show on a different channel the producer ( left ) said there was also a dispute over whether @entity200 ( right ) should be named @entity201 , but this was with with racing driver @entity203 the original idea was to call him ‘ @entity201 ’ after the sex slave character in film @entity208 but mr @entity12 revealed that @entity203 , who was the first person to take on the mantle of @entity200 , insisted on this being changed			1
yesterday , may ruled out returning to @entity1 without @entity18 , insisting it would be ' lame ' with a new presenter in place of his sacked co-host			1
the 52 - year - old said the @entity8 would be ‘ stupid ’ to try a version of the programme with ' a surrogate @entity216 ' , @entity0 and himself - adding that the idea was a ‘ non-starter ’			1
his comments mean that if the show does return next year , it will likely be with an entirely new presenting team			0
both may and @entity0 saw their contracts finish last month			2
may told @entity223 : ‘ me and @entity224 with a surrogate @entity216 is a non-starter , it just would n’t work			0
that would be lame , or “ awks ” as young people say			0
‘ it has to be the three of us			0
you ca n’t just put a surrogate @entity216 in and expect it to carry on			0
i do n’t believe they would be stupid enough to try that			0
‘ it does n’t mean i wo n’t go back - we may all go back in the future			0
it might just be we have a break from it			0
it would be a bloody tough call to do @entity1 without @entity216			2
’ former x factor host @entity244 , model @entity246 and @entity247 host @entity248 have all been named as possible replacements for @entity18			2
speaking after the meeting yesterday , may said he had just been ' having a pint ' with his co-stars and mr @entity12 , adding that he still did n't know what he would do in the future			2
while the three presenters have all now left @entity1 , they will still reunite for their live stadium tour later this year - now called @entity258			2
a @entity8 spokeswoman said : ' these comments from @entity12 were made in an article published last week before his resignation			1
furthermore , the comments refer to events more than a decade ago			0

@entity248 ( 10/1 ) @entity247 host @entity248 , 45 , was named as the favourite a fortnight ago , but this prompted a barrage of abusive tweets from ‘ blokes wishing me dead ’ , which saw her quit @entity9			0

@entity314 ( 14/1 ) a tongue - in - cheek petition signed by more than 34,000 people is calling on the @entity8 to hire fictional broadcaster @entity317 - played by 49 - year - old @entity314 - as the new presenter			2
