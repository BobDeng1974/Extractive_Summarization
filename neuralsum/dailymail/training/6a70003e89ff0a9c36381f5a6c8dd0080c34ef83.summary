according to @entity2 , @entity1 ’s stars will live in fear if they fail to make the grade in the @entity5			1
ahead of the clash with @entity8 , the midfielder spoke of new faces coming in at the end of the season as part of a dressing room purge			2
‘ let ’s be honest , we need to do something or otherwise next year it ’s going to be new players , ’ he claimed in the hours before they played @entity16 ’s team			0
judging by @entity1 ’s commitment to their current squad of players he can rest easy at night , whatever their results between now and the end of the season			1
this is not @entity43 and sir @entity44 , where he developed a habit of jettisoning players who were still at the top of their game			1
that policy at @entity50 kept the dressing room on their toes , establishing a relentless drive and hunger for success			0
@entity57 was @entity1 's saviour again on tuesday night with a sensational hat - trick nobody was safe and it is part of the reason they won 13 @entity64 titles , five @entity65 and two @entity66 during @entity44 ’s reign			1
he liked to keep the dressing room fresh			0
at @entity1 , where life is good and the money is even better , they have 17 players in the first team squad who are contracted to the club until 2017 at the very least			1
@entity76 ( suspended against @entity8 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , on loan at @entity86 , have contracts until 2017			2
there is a bigger commitment to @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , who are all tethered to the @entity64 champions until 2018			0
city manager @entity31 ( right ) is unlikely to jettison players if his side flop in @entity27 again bigger still are the contracts recently signed by five players - @entity57 , captain @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity2 - to keep them at the @entity101 until 2019			1
in short , they are going nowhere			0
successful contract negotiations are usually good news for supporters			0
after last season ’s success , stability seemed important			0
they have a different way of doing things at @entity1 and recent history suggests these players will be safe as houses at the end of the season			2
the big clear - out of star names has never actually occurred			0
since the big money came to the blue half of @entity121 , @entity122 ( who left for @entity123 in 2013 ) , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 have exited the club			0
@entity57 ( left ) and @entity99 have both signed deals with will keep them at @entity1 until 2019 when @entity43 were kings of @entity121 , they did things a lot differently under @entity44			1
last week , after the former @entity43 midfielder @entity135 helped @entity137 ’s press team to a 7 - 1 victory over @entity140 ’s media side , he gave a fascinating insight into @entity44 ’s methods			1
@entity135 only made a handful of appearances for the club after graduating from @entity147 ’s academy side , but he witnessed the manager 's ruthless streak on many occasions			0
for the top players the threat of leaving @entity43 was real and that power strengthened the manager ’s position within the dressing room			2
sir @entity44 ruled @entity50 with an iron fist when he was @entity43 manager @entity159 was sold by @entity44 because the boss thought the midfielder was trying to undermine him the most successful manager in @entity43 history occasionally got it wrong and he has apologised countless times for his ‘ senior moment ’ when he sold @entity167 to @entity168 in 2002			1
in his most recent book - @entity169 - he makes no apology for allowing some of the biggest players in @entity43 ’s history to leave at a time when they believed they were at the top of their game			1
despite the success of the title - winning teams in the @entity182 he sold @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 at various times			2
in 2003 he sold @entity159 to @entity189 for £ 25million all in after claiming that the midfielder had deliberately attempted to undermine him in front of the supporters			0
@entity183 ( left ) was sold in 1995 despite being a driving force in @entity44 's first two title triumphs @entity195 was moved on because @entity44 ‘ could n’t find a position for him ’ and @entity198 was sold to @entity189 : ‘ he became a really difficult boy			2
i do n’t think he was popular by the end ’			0
@entity201 , who had issues with his weight according to @entity44 , was sold to @entity204 after calling to order a @entity206 takeaway in front of the @entity43 manager			1
@entity209 , signed from @entity8 in 2007 , was ‘ a disaster ’			2
and there was no room for sentimentality - captains and iconic figures @entity215 and @entity216 were moved on in the mid-nineties			0
@entity198 was flogged to @entity189 when he ' became a really difficult boy ' @entity195 ( right ) was moved on because @entity44 ' could n't find a position for him ' @entity44 liked to keep that dressing room living in fear of change , to remind players that @entity43 always had a replacement in mind			1
city have been busy accumulating players , some very good ones at that , but they operate under a different set of criteria at the @entity101			0
they have kept all their big names sweet by tying them to lucrative , long - term contracts as part of a strategy to keep the club at the top of @entity241 football			1
beyond the money , they need to find a different way to motivate them			0
the sale of @entity167 ( left ) is @entity44 's main regret and something he puts down to a ' senior moment ' @entity250 proud of @entity1 fightback			1

@entity2 said earlier this week @entity1 players would be sold if they did not improve their *performances*
but have handed long - term contracts to most of their squad
sir @entity44 used to *regularly* sell key players at @entity43
but @entity1 are too *reliant* on their core to do that yet
@entity1 beat @entity8 3 - 2 after two late goals from @entity57
