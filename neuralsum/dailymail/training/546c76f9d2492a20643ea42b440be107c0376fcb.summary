by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 29 november 2013 @entity2 : 12:13 est , 29 november 2013 anyone who ’s travelled on @entity5 ’s @entity4 will know that it ’s often cramped – and very hot			2
but now engineers have found an ingenious use for the excess subterranean heat that it generates			0
it ’ll be captured and used to warm - up over 500 homes in the @entity14 area of the capital			1
the network has 1.4 miles of pipes which carry the heat to local housing estates and a leisure centre			0
heat from the @entity37 will be captured and added to this network			0
the heat network is currently fed by a @entity41 energy centre which produces both electricity and heat			0
in the same way that we use heat from a car engine to keep us warm when driving , the energy centre uses the heat created from producing electricity to help heat buildings and provide hot water			0
a mayor of @entity5 source said the scheme will reduce their heating bills by 10 per cent			1
the @entity37 project - the first of its kind in @entity60 - is a partnership between @entity28 , the mayor of london @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			1
mr @entity63 hopes it will help him achieve his pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent and produce 25 per cent of @entity5 ’s energy from local sources by by 2025			1
@entity71 , the mayor of @entity5 ’s senior advisor on @entity73 , said : ‘ we need to do everything possible to create a more secure , cost - effective and sustainable heat and power supply for @entity5			1
‘ by supporting locally sourced energy and heat networks which can reduce bills and lower carbon emissions , we can not only save money but also drive innovation , jobs and growth in this burgeoning sector			1
’ pioneering : the project - the first of its kind in @entity60 - is a partnership between @entity28 , the mayor of london @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 waste heat is on : this map shows the areas of @entity5 that produce the most excess warmth cllr @entity94 , @entity95 , said : ‘ the expanded @entity96 will cut energy bills for hundreds more local people			1
with energy prices going up and up , it 's vital we do what we can to cut bills			2
‘ it 's all part of the @entity28 's work to help people manage the rising cost of living			0
last winter was one of the coldest for decades and record energy prices meant many families on fixed incomes spent it in misery , unsure whether to heat or eat			0
’ @entity114 , head of future networks at @entity64 , said : ‘ we are carrying out a feasibility project exploring the potential to capture waste heat from one of our high voltage electricity substations and use it to warm local homes for the first time			0
‘ if it is successful there could be potential to replicate this and increase access to low carbon , low cost energy in other parts of the capital because we have electricity substations dotted throughout @entity5 which keep the lights on for millions of homes and businesses			2

the heat will be piped into around 500 houses in the @entity14 area
the scheme will knock around 10 per cent off heating bills
the project is the first of its kind in @entity60 and is part of the mayor of @entity5 's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2025
