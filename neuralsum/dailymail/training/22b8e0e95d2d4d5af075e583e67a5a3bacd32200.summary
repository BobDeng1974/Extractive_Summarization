passenger records held in the e-borders database , which covers details of all flights outside @entity32 to and from @entity3 , will be checked and there will be careful monitoring of the 100 immigrants whose visas expire daily			1
it comes after it was revealed last month that 40 per cent of immigrants who have been refused leave to stay in the country have not been sent the forms demanding they leave			1
reduce backlog : immigration minister @entity43 said warning sent to immigrants when their visa expires will reduce numbers who decide to overstay tens of thousands of these lapsed visa cases date back more than five years and are a legacy of @entity52 's catastrophic mismanagement of @entity3 's immigration system			1
immigration minister @entity43 said he hoped the new scheme would allow @entity56 staff more time to carry out enforcement operations and reduce the backlog			1
he said : ' we 're concentrating much more on enforcement			0
from debrief interviews we 've found that a third of people decide to overstay at the point their visa expires			1
' if we can send these people letters warning of the consequences of illegally overstaying then i 'm sure we can reduce the total number deciding to remain			0
' the move follows a @entity72 summer - long drive to remove visa ' overstayers ' that has led to thousands being removed , with 2,000 of those being in @entity22 alone			2
the majority of those targeted entered the country on student visas which have now expired			1
mr @entity43 said they mainly came from @entity81 , @entity19 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 and were now working illegally			0

working illegally : this @entity19 man was arrested by border police from the @entity103 in @entity92 , @entity22 where he was allegedly working illegally the chief inspector of immigration , @entity104 , criticised the @entity72 for not having a strategy for reducing the pool of overstayers last month			1
the only guidance staff were given for dealing with cases in this 150,000 - strong group was that the total size of the pool should not be allowed to increase			2
@entity104 said his greatest concern during his inspection of the @entity116 and @entity118 immigration team was over the ' 150,000 - plus cases nationally that are sitting in a migration refusal pool '			2

' in addition , around 21,000 new asylum cases have built up because officials were able to process only 63 per cent of last year 's applications			0
