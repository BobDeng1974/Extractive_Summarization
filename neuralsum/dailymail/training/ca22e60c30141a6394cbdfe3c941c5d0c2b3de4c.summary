calling to book a table , make a doctor 's appointment or phoning for help when stranded at the side of the road are tasks many people take for granted			1
but for the deaf , simple tasks like these typically require expensive equipment or a mediator - until now			2
the @entity12 app was created to help deaf people speak to friends , family and businesses on the phone using voice recognition and real - time speech translation			1
when a call is made using the app the user types a message on the screen			1
this is translated to speech in real time , so the recipient can ' hear ' them			1
the recipient 's spoken response is then immediately translated into text when a call is made using the free @entity40 or @entity42 app , the user types a message on the screen			1
this is translated to speech in real time , so the recipient can hear the request or @entity49 spoken response is then immediately translated into text			1
@entity21 was developed by @entity53 entrepreneur @entity52 after he heard a story about a deaf man whose car had broken down			1
the driver was unable to communicate by phone and was left waiting for hours hoping someone would notice and help him			2
last year a visually impaired developer from @entity62 launched an app designed to help blind people ' see '			1
the free @entity66 app connects blind people to a sighted volunteer using a live video chat			1
the volunteer can then answer questions and see the blind person 's surroundings using a phone 's camera			1
be my eyes takes advantage of an @entity78 feature called @entity79			0
this lets people who are completely blind use the device using synthetic speech and a touch - based interface			1
@entity21 does not require both users to have specific hardware , and all communications and interactions are private			2
if the voice transcription is not accurate enough , @entity21 automatically shows alternatives , and if it 's still not enough , a user can ask the recipient to repeat themselves using the ' r ' button			1
users can additionally record messages using their own voice by pressing the microphone button			0
although the app is free , calls cost 15p per minute when made in the @entity103 , @entity53 and @entity104 and users need to add credit to the account to make these calls			1
a typical top - up starts at £ 3.99 , but credit packages are also available in £ 5 , £ 10 , £ 20 and £ 50 bundles			0
from next month , users will also be given 20 free minutes every month			0
@entity21 launched in @entity53 in 2013 and is now available in the @entity103 , @entity113 and @entity114			2
the firm plans to expand further into @entity116 later this year			0
' being able to make a simple phone call is something we often take for granted , ' said mr @entity52			1
' there are over 70 million people in the world who have profound to severe hearing loss and are unable to use phones			0
if the voice transcription is not accurate enough @entity21 automatically shows alternatives , and if it 's still not enough , a user can ask the recipient to repeat themselves using the ' @entity132 ' button			1
users can record messages by pressing the microphone button ( left ) and use contact lists by connecting existing accounts ( right ) earlier this year @entity138 released an audio translation function for its translate app. transcription experts at @entity142 recently tested the tool 's accuracy when compared to human translators			2
for the first test , @entity146 and a translator called @entity148 were asked to translate a promotional document about @entity152 ’s @entity151 from @entity153 into @entity154			0
for the second test , both had to translate a minute of @entity153 audio into @entity154			0
for both document and audio translation , @entity138 was able to capture the ' overall gist ' of the content and @entity142 said it would be useful for quick , general understanding			0
transcription experts at @entity142 recently tested @entity146 's accuracy when compared to human translators ( pictured )			0
@entity138 ’s translations ' were too raw to be used for any professional purpose , and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar ' , explained the firm but @entity142 added that @entity138 ’s translations ' were too raw to be used for any professional purpose , and readability was often compromised by poor word choices and questionable grammar '			0
in the second test , for example , @entity138 failed to translate the word ' ya ya '			0
@entity148 had a higher degree of overall accuracy and a greater ability to capture the tone and style of the original documents			0
by being able to consider the subject matter , context , and target audience , @entity148 's translations sounded more natural			2
' of course , a human translator wo n’t fit in your pocket , and they may not always be able to accompany you to that very authentic @entity190 restaurant or overseas vacation , ' explained @entity192			0
' when you need immediate results , and they do n’t have to be perfect , it ’s ok to use @entity146			0
' [ but ] for any sort of business or commercial documents , or anything that has to be precise , it ’s best to stick with human translators			0
' ' a smartphone is something most people have , so @entity21 is designed to help make everyday life easier by offering a more accessible way to communicate whenever they like over the phone			1
' last year a visually impaired developer from @entity62 launched a similar app designed to help blind people ' see '			2

the app is currently only available for people using an @entity232 or above , running @entity42			1
a similar app called be my eyes takes advantage of an @entity78 feature called @entity79 , to help blind people use the device with synthetic speech			1

this can be anything from knowing the expiry date on the milk ( pictured ) , to navigating new surroundings			0
