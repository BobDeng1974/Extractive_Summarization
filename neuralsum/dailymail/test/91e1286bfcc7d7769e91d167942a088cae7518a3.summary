a giant lamb born weighing the same as a toddler is thought to be the biggest ever birthed in the @entity3			1
the animal , aptly named @entity5 after the fictional giant in @entity7 , was born on tuesday at three times the size of its peers			1
dwarfing other newborns on the farm in @entity15 near @entity16 in @entity17 where he was born , @entity5 's owners believe he may be the biggest ever lamb born in the @entity3 at 25lbs			1
despite his remarkable size the lamb was born naturally and his mother is making a good recovery			2
' i could n't believe my eyes - he was enormous			0
' it presented all correctly with two feet and his head and i just needed to help him out			0
