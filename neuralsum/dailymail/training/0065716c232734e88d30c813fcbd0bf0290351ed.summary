by @entity0 published : 07:41 est , 8 august 2012 updated : 08:12 est , 9 august 2012 they say in the @entity3 it 's not the winning that counts , but the taking part			1
and that was certainly the case this morning as @entity8 , the first female track athlete to compete for @entity9 in the @entity3 , was cheered every step of the way in her 800m heat			1
in the end , she completed the two laps of the track nearly 45 seconds behind the winner , but her participation alone represented an historic moment			1
she wore a white hijab , green long - sleeved top and jogging bottoms to comply with her country 's rules on female modesty dressed in a long - sleeved green training top , long jogging bottoms and a white hijab , she certainly stood out on the start line in sweltering heat in the @entity23			0
and it was quickly obvious that @entity8 was n't going to be able to keep pace with the rest of the field as she fell a long way behind			0
but whatever the sport , @entity3 crowds love a plucky trier and @entity8 was given a standing ovation as she crossed the finish line , almost a full lap behind the others			1
her time of two minutes 44.95 seconds was a long way behind that recorded by the winner , @entity61 's @entity60 , who ran two minutes 01.04 seconds			2
@entity8 started in lane eight in heat six of the 800m in the @entity23 @entity8 , 19 , studies art at the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			1
she has dual @entity9 and @entity70 nationality but chose to compete for the homeland of her father it does n't matter though , because @entity8 is making history as one half of the first ever women 's team to represent @entity9			1
speaking after the race , she said : ' it is such an honour to be representing @entity9			0
hopefully this can make such a huge difference			0
' it was such a unique opportunity [ to represent @entity9 ] , they invited me and welcomed me and to make that first step for women is just the most amazing feeling ever			2
' her run today was four seconds slower than her personal best time			0
but the 800m is n't @entity8 's strongest race as she 's more comfortable at 1500m distance the other competitors had long since crossed the line - second from last @entity94 of the @entity95 was 32 second quicker @entity8 is the first female @entity9 track athlete to participate in the @entity3 after the nation 's @entity98 overturned a ban on women			1
she was given a standing ovation as she crossed the finish line she was all smiles after the race , despite being the slowest competitor members of the press scrambled to grab a few words from @entity8 after the race her teammate , the judoka @entity110 , wrote her name into @entity3 history on friday when she was defeated by @entity114 @entity113 in a first round bout			1
the fight only lasted a minute but @entity110 will forever have the distinction of being the first @entity9 female olympian			0
the pair were forced to walk behind the male @entity9 athletes in the @entity126 parade of nations , a symbol of an ultra-conservative country in which women are actively discouraged from participating in sport			2
the judoka @entity110 ( left ) , getting to grips with @entity114 @entity113 in a first round bout , is the other woman in the @entity9 squad both were given rapturous receptions by the @entity137 crowds as they took part in their events and their presence in @entity141 represents a giant stride forward for gender equality in their country			2
@entity8 , 19 , was born and raised in @entity68 and trains at @entity66 in @entity67 , where she is studying art. she has dual nationality because of her @entity9 father @entity148 and chose to represent the @entity150 country			1
the @entity9 @entity98 overturned a ban on women athletes in june despite strong opposition from many quarters of society			1
but officials demanded that all female competitors would be dressed ' to preserve their dignity ' - hence the modest , long - sleeved garments and hijab covering the hair			0
it was reported before the @entity163 that @entity66 had been asked to remove photographs from an online biography of @entity8 because they showed her in a tank top and shorts with no hijab			0
@entity169 of @entity170 pulled up injured during her 100m heat @entity173 's @entity172 crosses the line in her 100m heat on friday in @entity9 , most women cover their heads and faces in public and wear a black cloak called an abaya			2
she is one of a number of @entity150 track athletes who have competed in hijabs at the @entity163 , including @entity169 of @entity170 and @entity183 of @entity173			0
there were similar scenes in the @entity23 when the @entity187 400m runner @entity186 finished nearly half a minute after the winner in her heat on friday			0
wearing a blue hijab and ' modest ' clothing , @entity186 was applauded by the crowd as she crossed the line			0
