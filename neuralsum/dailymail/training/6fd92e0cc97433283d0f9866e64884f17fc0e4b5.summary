by @entity0 @entity2 forgotten man @entity1 was all smiles as the west @entity5 side went through pre-season testing on thursday			0
the 25 - year - old - who impressed on loan at @entity9 in the second half of last season - looked set to leave the club earlier this summer but with a move so far failing to materialise , the maverick playmaker could yet remain in @entity14 for the upcoming @entity16 campaign			1
happy : @entity1 looks quite content to be back training at @entity2 @entity18 sent @entity1 home from the club 's pre-season tour of @entity22 last summer , but with the former @entity25 manager yet to bolster his side in the close season , the @entity23 could well add a different dimension to his squad			1
despite not being active in the market so far , moves for @entity31 and @entity32 are reportedly close to being completed , with @entity18 also keen to add at least one striker to his ranks ahead of the new campaign graft : @entity38 puts himself through his paces during pre-season training today aiming high : @entity41 is raring to go ahead of the new @entity16 campaign prepared : @entity41 is aiming high ahead of the new season while @entity44 will look to continue his goalscoring exploits from last summer			2
@entity38 , @entity41 and @entity44 were all pictured at @entity2 's training base in @entity47 on thursday morning , with the club 's eyes now firmly focused on their opening fixture at home to @entity52 next month			0
