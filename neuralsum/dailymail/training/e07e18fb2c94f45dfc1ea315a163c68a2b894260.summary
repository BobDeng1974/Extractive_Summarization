' aerial photography is one of a range of tactics we ’re using to crack down on this problem and we hope evidence of heat in outbuildings will help us build a true picture of how many sheds are being lived in and where they are			0
' some of these buildings are perfectly habitable but others are not compliant and we will take action to amend their use or have them removed			0
' cllr @entity116 ' we will be able to cross-check and see whether they have valid @entity119 which are required by law for places where people live			0

' one option is to repeatedly fine a landlord for not having an @entity119			0
the fine is £ 200 a day , making it very expensive for people to continue using the outbuilding			2
