by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 11 november 2013 a fire at a @entity3 factory billed the world 's biggest maker of knishes has created a nationwide shortage of the @entity9 treats anywhere			1
a fire on september 24 at the @entity12 's plant in @entity13 , @entity14 , damaged the machinery that makes the company 's biggest seller - the original @entity17 @entity16 , which also come filled with kasha or spinach			1
@entity24 , diners , food carts and grocery stores have been short on the snack since the six - week - long shortage began , but lovers of the square , fried , doughy pillows of pureed potatoes may not have to go without much longer			2
this photo shows @entity33 's @entity17 square knishs the factory promises an end to the knish crunch by @entity37 , which coincides with the start of @entity39			1
' our customers ... are calling us saying they are literally searching supermarkets and stores and they 're all asking when we 'll be back , ' @entity44 , one of the owners of the 92 - year - old @entity46 , which sells about 15 million knishes a year			1
@entity12 's , which also makes matzoh balls , blintzes and latkas , sells the knishes both online and at retail outlets around the country , with @entity3 , @entity55 and @entity56 leading the sales			1
' for the last month i have n't had any knishes â€” my heart is broken , ' said @entity61 , a @entity62 who has been without a knish to nosh since the @entity66 's wholesale store near her @entity68 home suddenly stopped stocking them			1
but @entity61 did n't learn of the shortage until she visited her sister for lunch at the @entity74 restaurant in @entity75 , @entity14 , and found that it was out of stock , too			1
a food cart in @entity79 in @entity3 sports signs offering square potato - filled @entity9 snacks @entity74 owner @entity83 said he normally sells about 2,000 knishes a month			0
' it brings you back to your childhood and they 're just so delicious , ' @entity83 said			1
' @entity12 is square and fried			0
you bite into it and the potato oozes out			0
' @entity92 , the 125 - year - old landmark on @entity79 's @entity94 , ordinarily sells about 6,000 knishes a month			2
' i usually get four to take home , ' grumbled @entity99 native @entity98			0
' their crunchiness , their hard corners , the mustard and sauerkraut you put on them			0
you ca n't beat a knish			2
' like most places , the round , baked version is still available			0
but @entity98 harrumphed a familiar sentiment of knish devotees : ' who gets round knishes ? ' @entity115 , a retired it employee , did n't know there was a shortage until he got to the @entity119 's counter			1
' i miss them , ' he said			0
' it 's something i grew up with			2
i like the taste , sliced with mustard			0
... i always look for them , and i have n't seen them recently			0
' @entity119 's chef @entity127 has grown weary of explaining the shortage to customers			2
along with the pastrami sandwiches , he serves up a typical @entity3 attitude to the ongoing complaints			0
' get over it ! get a life ! it 's just a knish			1

@entity138 's plant in @entity13 , @entity14 , was damaged by fire on september 4
