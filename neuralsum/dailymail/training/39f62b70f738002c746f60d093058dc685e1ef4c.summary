@entity1 supporters booed coach @entity2 and goalkeeper @entity3 but saw their team win 2 - 0 against @entity5 to stay clear at the top of @entity7			1
there were even a few jeers for an out - of - sorts for @entity11 when he blasted a second half free - kick over but the @entity13 set up the second for @entity15 after @entity16 had scored the first			1
the worst whistles were reserved for @entity2 and @entity3 and were audible when the team and managers ’ names were announced before kick - off			1
@entity3 ’ error had cost @entity1 the opening goal seven days earlier in the 4 - 0 derby day defeat to @entity26 and @entity2 was criticised for his team selection but as with most of the abuse levelled at @entity1 players from their own fans – most recently to @entity31 – it was incomprehensible especially as it came at the start of the game and seemed to help ensure @entity1 made a nervous start			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity16 ( left ) opened the scoring with a curled finish from @entity39 's pass in the first - half @entity15 follows the ball into the net after doubling @entity1 's lead to complete a 2 - 0 victory @entity1 superstars celebrate as they move four points clear of arch rivals @entity47 at the top of @entity7 @entity1 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity3 ; @entity39 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) ; @entity31 , @entity15 ( @entity57 ) , @entity11			1
substitutes : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62			0
booked : @entity50 , @entity39 scorers : @entity55 22 ' , @entity64 ' @entity5 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity65 ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity72 ) ; @entity73 , @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , @entity76 ; @entity77 ( @entity78 )			1
substitutes : @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83			0
booked : @entity71 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity66 @entity3 at least wasted no time in responding to the boo - boys with a fine save at his near - post from @entity86			0
the former @entity47 winger tested the home defence on several occasions in the first 15 minutes			0
for @entity1 , @entity11 hit the bar and @entity31 then charged through to the edge of the area and did likewise with a ferocious shot			2
the @entity94 turned provider next with a cross that @entity15 should have done better with but allowed @entity65 to push away for a corner			0
when @entity1 finally took the lead on 23 minutes it was from @entity55 just inside the area immediately after @entity11 had missed from much closer in			1
he failed to finish from a yard out from @entity15 ’s cross and @entity16 saved the day with a curling shot into the far corner when it looked as if @entity5 had cleared the danger			1
it was a boost for the team but @entity11 's miss did nothing to improve his state of mind			2
he had made an uncharacteristically quiet start to the game after a tumultuous week when the celebration of his 30th birthday party had made almost as much news as @entity1 ’s derby - day defeat that came just hours before it			0
@entity31 was comfortably @entity1 ’s best performer in the first half and his run and cross gave @entity11 the chance to make it two but he headed over			2
there was one moment of brilliant skill from @entity11 who turned @entity5 ’s 39 - year - old full - back @entity67 inside out but it was @entity31 who finished the half strongly crossing from the right only for team - mates to again fail to capitalise			1
@entity1 head coach @entity2 was roundly jeered ahead of the game following their previous defeat to @entity26 @entity5 midfielder @entity135 reacts after missing a superb opportunity to give the visitors an early lead @entity11 was uncharacteristically subdued after being criticised for celebrating his birthday after defeat to @entity26 @entity1 winger @entity31 ( left ) was denied a first - half goal after his long - range strike hit the woodwork @entity145 superstar ronaldo attempts an ambitious overhead kick as the hosts strive to break the deadlock @entity55 's curled effort opens the scoring for @entity1 after both @entity11 and @entity15 had contrived to miss @entity151 international @entity55 celebrates after giving @entity1 the lead after being set up by @entity39 @entity16 kisses his tattooed arm as @entity1 take control after a lively start from the visitors if @entity1 had started to look more convincing at the end of the first half that was all forgotten at the start of the second with @entity5 hitting the post from @entity71 and @entity3 making a fine save down to his left from @entity163 loanee @entity77			1
the jeers for the keeper at the start of the game were now replaced with applause			0
he was keeping @entity1 in the game			0
@entity55 had to intervene at the back post to break down another visitors ’ attack			0
and @entity11 ’s afternoon was getting no better as he blasted a free - kick over the bar from the edge of the area and there were even a few jeers for the three - times @entity13 winner			0
@entity1 brought on winter window signing @entity54 for @entity53 with 20 minutes left and immediately got the second goal			0
@entity11 played @entity15 in and he scored with a first - time shot over the advancing @entity65			2
@entity57 came on for @entity15 and set - up @entity11 now playing at centre - forward			2
the @entity145 sent the chance wide smashing the turf in frustration at the miss. @entity1 stay top with the win and remain @entity190 favourites ahead of this week ’s trip to @entity188 to play @entity193 but the mood has changed considerably since the group stages when they and their talisman @entity11 looked invincible			0
@entity1 no 1 @entity3 was also targeted by the boo boys before pulling off a succession of fine saves the world 's most expensive player @entity31 was arguably @entity1 's best player despite recent criticism from fans @entity205 winner @entity52 evades the attention of a group of @entity5 defenders new signing , and former @entity211 target , @entity54 was introduced to the @entity212 in the second half @entity15 stretches over @entity5 keeper @entity214 as @entity1 double their lead on 73minutes the @entity221 international pumps the air with his fist after ading to his impressive goals tally this season @entity1 team - mates race to congratulate @entity15 as they open up a four - point lead at the top of @entity7 @entity31 takes down the ball on his chest as @entity1 see out the closing minutes of the game even @entity1 talisman ronaldo was booed after missing several chances to score during the victory			1
