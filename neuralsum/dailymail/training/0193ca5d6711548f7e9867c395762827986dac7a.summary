new mother @entity5 lost almost four stone after hearing workmates gossiping about her size @entity5 lost four stone after hearing colleagues talking about her weight gain when she was in a toilet cubicle despite the new mother making several attempts to shed her baby weight , it was n’t until she heard colleagues laughing about her looks that she was spurred into starting a serious diet			1
and after just over three months on a strict diet plan normally recommended only to obese people , @entity5 dropped three dresses sizes			1
@entity5 , who works as a window dresser for a department store , said : ' i knew i ’d put on weight after i had @entity14 , and i wanted to lose it , but it just never seemed to be a priority			1
' i was n’t happy with how i looked , but it was only when i heard other people talking about me that i got the kick up the backside i needed to do something about it			2
' i was in a toilet cubicle at work when i heard two other girls that i work with talking about me			0
@entity5 shrank from a size 14 to a slinky size 8 after ditching the comfort food and said picturing herself in a bikini helped to keep her on track ' they were saying that i ’d really let myself go since i ’d had my little girl			1
i heard one of them say : ‘ maybe she just does n’t realise how fat she is now ? ’ ' i was devastated			1
i had always been very slim and really taken pride in my appearance			0
' that was the motivation i needed to lose the baby weight			1
that night , i logged onto mumsnet and asked people how they ’d lost the baby weight - and loads of people recommended the @entity67 plan			1
@entity5 says that having the same colleagues who she had overheard gossiping about her weight gain tell her how good she looked made her feel good ' it ’s a very strict diet which is just what i needed			1
i ’m all or nothing , so as soon as i committed to a diet where i was only allowed to eat shakes and soups , i was really committed			2

the @entity77 is a diet based on meal replacement products			0
using the brand bars , soups and shakes , people following the diet eat a meal plan consisting of between 440kcal to 1500 + kcal per day			2
the meal replacements can also be combined with normal foods on the diet for a slower weight loss			2
the diet programe is generally only suggest for those with an ' over-weight ' @entity92 ( over 25 )			0

' my partner always told me that i was beautiful , but i worried that one day he would be thinking the same as they had done			0
' i wanted the old me back , and as soon as the pounds started melting away , it was easy to keep going			0
' it was so easy for the pounds to creep on when i was a new mum			0
i was putting all my energy into looking after @entity14 , and i just stopped caring about how i looked			0
' but now i realise that i can do both			0
' every time i wanted to cave in and have a bar of chocolate , i ’d just picture myself in my bikini , and i ’d keep going			0
' i started going swimming twice a week too , to tone my muscles , which was a huge help			2
' people at work started to notice once a stone or so had come off , and i got loads of compliments			2
