mr @entity2 is making his new year address while his administration attempts to revive his hated tax plan after the constitutional council ruled that the way the highly contentious tax was designed was unconstitutional			0

embattled : @entity3 president @entity2 suffered a fresh setback yesterday when @entity3 's highest court threw out a plan to tax the ultra-wealthy at a 75 per cent rate and said it was unfair it was an insignificant amount in the context of @entity3 's roughly € 85billion ( £ 70billion ) deficit			1
au revoir : actor @entity33 recently announced his intention to turn in his @entity3 passport and move to a village in a tax - friendly @entity37 prime minister @entity38 was quick to respond , saying in a statement following the decision that the government would resubmit the measure to take the court 's concerns into account			2

a household with two earners each making under € 1million ( £ 820,000 ) would be exempt from the tax , while one with one earner making € 1.2million ( £ 980,000 ) would have to pay			2
the @entity3 government approved the tax in its most recent budget , amid criticism that it would do little to stem the country 's mounting fiscal problems and would drive away the wealthiest citizens			0
meanwhile president @entity2 's popularity has been tanking as the country 's unemployment continued its rise for the 19th straight month			0
