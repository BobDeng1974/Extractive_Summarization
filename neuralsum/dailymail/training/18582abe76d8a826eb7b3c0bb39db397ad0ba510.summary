but a better economic environment , a stronger dollar and lower gas prices will likely boost outbound travel from the @entity85			0

the @entity108 rises above a beach in @entity53 's @entity52 , which is hugely popular with @entity61 ' @entity111 cities will likely benefit too , thanks to strong cultural positioning and historical ties to the @entity85			0
