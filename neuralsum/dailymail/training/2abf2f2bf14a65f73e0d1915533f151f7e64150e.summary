@entity0 has confirmed that goalkeeper @entity1 will miss the next ‘ six to eight games ’ and has challenged rookie @entity3 to win a new contract in that time			1
@entity5 - who are without first choice @entity7 until the end of january - can not bring in a replacement stopper on an emergency loan deal and will instead hand 21 - year - old @entity3 his full @entity13 debut at @entity14 on saturday			2
and @entity0 , who lost @entity1 to a torn thigh muscle during last weekend ’s 2 - 1 victory over @entity17 , explained : ‘ @entity18 will be out for six to eight games , so it 's a great opportunity for @entity3 and he 's very keen to take it			1
rookie @entity3 is set for a sustained run in the @entity5 side after an injury to goalkeeper @entity1 @entity1 was forced to leave @entity5 's win against @entity17 at the weekend with a thigh injury @entity3 cut an impressive presence as he thwarted the @entity13 regularly at @entity28 ‘ he 's had a great start and has fitted in very well			1
he has worked very hard in the background but never had an opportunity			0
‘ i have great faith in him but he will need a lot of luck as well , particularly in that crucial position			0
‘ he deserves a bit of luck because he is a cracking lad and i ’m very proud of him			0
‘ his contract is up at end of season and this puts him in a great position if he plays really well in the next seven game , and makes it more difficult for us when it comes to contract negotiations			0
that is definitely in @entity3 's court			2

@entity1 left the win against @entity17 because of a thigh injury
it means rookie @entity3 will get a sustained run in the side
first choice goalkeeper @entity7 is out until @entity61
