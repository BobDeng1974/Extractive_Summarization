both were provided with @entity93 credit cards in their own names on mr @entity3 ’s @entity96 company account			0
it was made clear , the prosecutor said , that these were not for personal purchases unless agreed by @entity82 or mr @entity3			0
but the court heard how in june 2012 , mr @entity3 ’s company accountant @entity101 investigated spending on both cards and found the bills had risen from ‘ £ 10,000 - £ 20,000 a month to £ 50,000 a month ’			1
