he is pictured with his father when he was in a coma he said : ‘ it was an extremely emotional moment when i saw the picture of @entity7 standing unaided - it was a special moment			1
‘ i was in tears , he is such a fighter , i would not have dreamed he would have come this far in such a small amount of time			2
‘ he has had quite a remarkable progression , although there is obviously a very long way to go and the movement on his left side is limited , but he is n’t giving up and we are all behind him supporting him			0
@entity7 's father , @entity32 , said : ' it was an extremely emotional moment when i saw the picture of @entity7 standing unaided - it was a special moment ' @entity7 ( pictured with his father , @entity32 , in hospital ) was not wearing a helmet when the accident happened because he was worried about messing up his hairstyle ‘ i do n’t use the term miracle a lot in my profession but he is becoming somewhat of a miracle			1
‘ we are still going round to schools and teaching people about how safe it is to wear a cycle helmet and the affects it can have on people who do n’t and their families			1
a coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and can not be woken			0
people who are in a coma are alive but have very little brain activity			0
every case is different - some are unable to hear voices while others have some awareness of their environment			0
comas are most often causes by events such as a severe head injury or a stroke			0
they can last for hours , days or months			0
some people remain in a coma for years , but this is unusual			0
the chances of recovery depend upon how much of the brain has been damaged			0
generally , the longer a person has been in a coma , the poorer the outlook			0
people do n't usually suddenly wake up from a coma - they come round gradually			2
some will make a full recovery while others will have severe long - term health problems			0
‘ it is hard to get it debated in parliament , but we will not stop trying to get people to wear them			0
‘ right now , we are preparing everything at home , we have a lot of work to do there as @entity7 will be leaving @entity45 in two months to come home			1
‘ we are literally counting down the days till we can see him back at home , but we are under no illusions that it will be hard work for us and for @entity7			2
’ the @entity143 are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear helmets after @entity7 chose not to wear one due to his fashionable hair style			1
cycle helmets are not compulsory in @entity149			0
@entity151 champion and @entity153 winner sir @entity150 has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads			1
former @entity158 international footballer @entity157 , 38 , who beat testicular cancer in 2009 , visited @entity7 on his birthday on march 31			2
since seeing @entity7 ’s story , @entity157 has taken @entity7 on as his ‘ adopted son ’ according to mr @entity7 , and even changed his @entity164 picture to the pair of them together and asked his 205,000 followers to support the teen			2
mr @entity7 added : ‘ @entity157 has been magnificent with @entity7 and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him			2
@entity7 was in a coma for four months before he finally woke up in november			1
he is now going through intensive rehabilitation before he goes home in two months @entity7 is being supported by former footballer @entity157 who has taken him on as an ' adopted son ' ‘ he has been tweeting and supporting online , he has literally taken on @entity176 as his “ adopted son ” it has been great			1

‘ by him doing all of this for us , which he did n’t have to , he wanted to , it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant			0
