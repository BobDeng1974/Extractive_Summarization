@entity1 is a ' @entity2 in stilts ' whose remarks about immigrants and ethnic minorities reveal the ' truly odious nature of his views ' , @entity0 claimed today in an extraordinary attack on the @entity10 leader			1
in an interview with @entity12 , mr @entity0 said mr @entity1 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines			1
the @entity19 leader condemned @entity21 's appeal to @entity10 supporters to ' come home ' , warning the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' which is losing all grip on the party			1
@entity19 leader @entity0 claimed @entity1 's ' mask is slipping ' to reveal a man uncomfortable talking about people who are not white ' lashing out ' in a scrabble for headlines mr @entity21 issued an appeal to people planning to vote @entity10 to instead support the @entity35 in an attempt to block a ' toxic tie - up ' between @entity38 and the @entity39			1
but mr @entity0 condemned the ' worrying ' suggestion that his former coalition partners should seek to build a majority by appealing to people on the ' far right '			2
speaking in his bright yellow campaign bus as he headed to the @entity45 , mr @entity0 : mr @entity1 has courted controversy throughout the election campaign , in an apparent attempt to generate headlines and shore up @entity10 's core vote			1
he was condemned in the first tv leaders ' debate for saying people with @entity54 should not be allowed into @entity55 and in the second for attacking the audience for being too left - wing			0
after criticism that the @entity10 manifesto featured almost all white faces , he insisted yesterday that there was a ' half black ' party spokesman featured prominently - and ' one fully black person '			1
the @entity19 leader told @entity12 's political editor @entity65 that the ' bandwagons of the far right ' are encircling an ' increasingly hapless conservative leadership ' @entity69 been writing a food blog @entity0 is such a bad cook his wife @entity71 only lets him do the washing up			1
the @entity19 leader admitted his ' rubbishness ' in the kitchen after it emerged his wife and sons had been secretly running a food blog - @entity78 - posting recipes and photographs online			1
mr @entity0 said he had played no part in the culinary operation , but had helped with taking pictures for the blog : ' i 'm sure you can see my hand in a couple of them			2
' but his own cooking abilities do not stretch to more than peanut butter on toast			0
' i 'm a sort of sous chef , mr @entity0 told @entity12			0
' i provide helpful moral backing and assistance			0
i 'll do the washing up , and tasting and preparatory tasks			0
' asked if there was nothing he could cook , mr @entity0 replied : ' i 'm sure i could but i 'm great eater , i 'm just really not a very good cook			2
' if i had to , if i was starving ... peanut butter on white toast obviously , with jam on top			0
i 'm seriously into jam on top			0
' ms @entity109 said she had run a cooking blog with her children for three years mr @entity0 said the comments revealed mr @entity1 's true nature : ' the mask is slipping			1
i think the more he thrashes around to get attention the more the mask slips and the truly odious nature of his views become more and more obvious			0
' this is someone who is clearly uncomfortable talking about people from different ethnic backgrounds , calls them ' half ' and ' fully ' black , but is also someone who advocates basically turning our backs on people who are very sick and kind of indulging in a language that is so divisive , so odious			1
' mr @entity0 , who boasts that the @entity19 will win many , many more seats than @entity10 on may 7 , accused mr @entity1 of ' running a truly incompetent campaign '			1
' he is just lashing around , thrashing around , lurching from one odious gaffe or assertion to the next			0
' one moment he claims he wants to take his manifesto seriously and the next he is talking about fully and half black candidates			1
' you are either serious or a kind of @entity2 on stilts			0
which one are you ? ' it just beggars belief that it is that kind of person that the conservative party thinks they need to bring back into the fold			2
' he said mr @entity21 's appeal to @entity10 voters ' could not have been more explicit - people like @entity1 , please come back home '			1
' i do n't think the @entity151 should have a home for those kind of views , ' he added			0
mr @entity0 , who visited the @entity155 in @entity156 , @entity157 before travelling to @entity158 , said he would use the final 15 days of the campaign to tell voters of the ' danger of these kind of really odious views basically taking over or encroaching upon how a mainstream party like the conservative party thinks and acts '			2
he warned that without the @entity19 back in coalition , the @entity35 would be dragged to the ' extremes ' by right wing backbenchers , @entity10 and the @entity169			1
he said that it is a ' tragedy ' that a centrist politician like mr @entity21 had lost control of his party			1
' what 's happening is you are seeing the bandwagons of the far right encircling an increasingly hapless @entity151 leadership			2
' and the @entity151 leadership will become just victim to and puppets of an array of hardline right wing voices from @entity10 , from @entity169 , from their own backbenches , which will do huge damage to our country			1
mr @entity0 , who visited the @entity155 factory in @entity156 , @entity157 today , said the @entity19 would act as a ' bulwark ' against the @entity35 lurching to the right mr @entity0 claimed right wing @entity35 want to ' enter into coalition with @entity10 , some of them want to bring back the death penalty , they want to ban the burka ' mr @entity1 - appearing on @entity198 's @entity197 this morning - has courted controversy throughout the election campaign , sparking accusations from mr @entity0 today that he was an ' odious @entity2 ' ( pictured right ) mr @entity0 claimed right wing @entity35 want to ' enter into coalition with @entity10 , some of them want to bring back the death penalty , they want to ban the burka '			1
' they have got very hardline views on people who need help from the state because they have fallen on hard times , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' and they take this very ideological view that basically the state and support for public services should be remorselessly cut back and cut back and cut back and cut back for no reason other than some kind of hardline ideological preference for it			2
' mr @entity0 went head to head with mr @entity1 in two tv debates last year , ahead of the @entity224 elections , which @entity10 went on to win while the @entity19 lost all but one seat in @entity228			1
mr @entity0 insisted most people in @entity55 are ' decent and pragmatic ' , and that the @entity19 are most ' in tune ' with public opinion			1
but he admitted he faces a ' challenge ' to turn that into votes after a devastating collapse in popularity since entering coalition five years ago			2
we 're the guarantee that will not let the swivel - eyed brigade take over			0
he added : ' we are the only bulwark , we are the only barrier , we are the only dam against this increasing pressure from people with some very , very nasty views which would lead to ideologically imposed cuts on nurseries , on schools on colleges			0
' @entity21 came under fire from mr @entity0 as he visited @entity254 children 's daycare nursery in @entity255 with @entity257 mayor @entity256 mr @entity0 said he defended mr @entity1 's right to say controversial things in an open democracy , but hoped they would be defeated on @entity262			1
' i really really abhor what @entity1 stands for but i do n't begrudge the right to say what he says and seek to represent those views in @entity224			0
' what worries me much more is not whether he gets a number of @entity270 in the @entity271 , those seats then become the tail that wags the @entity151 dog			0
' democracy should be able to encompass views that i would find absolutely beyond the pale , that 's what being a free country is about			0
' it 's about disagreeing with those views , taking them on , arguing against them and defeating them in an argument			0
' it 's not about saying they should n't be expressed			0
that would be very illiberal			0
' a @entity10 spokesman said : ' this smacks of desperation from a @entity0 , horrified by his disastrous polls , trying to punch above his weight			2
if only he 'd do it with policy , rather than these venting , personal attacks			0
a trick he has obviously learned from mr @entity21			0
