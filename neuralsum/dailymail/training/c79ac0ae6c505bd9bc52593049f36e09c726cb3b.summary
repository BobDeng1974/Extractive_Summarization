by @entity0 when @entity9 and @entity10 appeared on @entity11 ’ den seeking investment for @entity4 , the company they ran from their 17th century manor house in the @entity8 countryside , the business took off			1
with the profits from selling their computer mice in the shape of classic cars , they were able to transform the four - bedroom house and complete a renovation they started in 2002			1
the money enabled them to add a steam room , hot tub , one - bedroom apartment over the triple garage , a vast conservatory and a helipad that doubles as a putting green and croquet lawn			1
the four - bedroom 17th century @entity29 in @entity8 , also comes with a one - bedroom flat above the triple garage ‘ it had originally been three farmworkers ’ cottages , apparently housing 28 people , but in the 19th century the @entity38 of @entity39 claimed it , kicked them out , turned it into a single home and called it the @entity29 , ’ says @entity9 , 56 , who runs her own business as a consultant to the building industry			1
‘ on the night @entity11 ’ @entity2 went out , our website received 3,500 hits per second , and the company that hosted the site thought we were under cyber attack and shut it down – until they realised they were real customers , ’ says @entity10 , 57			1
the firm was born after a party for which @entity9 baked a cake topped with a @entity56 model of a @entity57 – @entity10 ’s dream car			2
‘ a couple of days later i was sitting at my desk rolling the car up and down and it struck me that it was just like moving a mouse , ’ said @entity10			2
he tried to find a firm that made car - shaped mice , but when he could n’t , he started @entity4			1
spacious : the £ 1.25million property 's summer house overlooks the garden lake modern interior : the current owners , entrepreneurial couple @entity9 and @entity72 , have made sure the house is in shipshape paying off : since their success with @entity4 , the @entity74 have been able to add a hot tub , one - bedroom apartment over the triple garage , a vast conservatory and a helipad / putting green that was five years ago			1
the business quickly outgrew the @entity29 in @entity83 , near @entity84 , in the middle of the 3,000 - acre @entity87 close to the @entity89 border			1
now the house has outgrown @entity9 and @entity10 , and they want to move			0
‘ we want to downsize , ’ says @entity10 , who is not a man to sit still for long , and did much of the work on the house himself			0
‘ we ’ve always bought and renovated houses , and now i ’d like to build one from scratch and project manage it myself			0
’ moving on : @entity10 and @entity101 are selling to downsize selling the house , which is on the market with @entity104 for £ 1.25 million , should not be too difficult			2
as well as the immaculate accommodation , it has delightful gardens and spectacular views			0
its two acres of land include a summer house in the style of a @entity113 rum shack and a vast lake , which is home to the couple ’s pets – two ducks and two geese – and is stocked with fish			2
@entity121 , of @entity104 , says the local market has performed steadily and he is confident of finding a buyer			0
‘ @entity29 prices have gone up 4.8 per cent in @entity8 in the past 12 months , ’ he adds			1
he adds that there is interest from people in @entity128 , which is 12 miles away , who want to be further out ‘ in the sticks ’ , as well as people moving from @entity133 who want to hide away in the country but still need good commuter access to @entity136 ( 20 minutes by car ) and to airports			0
while the house is for sale , so is the business , and the couple are in talks with several buyers			0
‘ we only ever intended to run it for five years and i now have another idea that i ’m discussing with big retailers , ’ says @entity10			0
the couple say for the past five years they have been helping former dragon @entity151 sift through hundreds of entrepreneurs who approach him every week			0
‘ we became mini dragons , ’ says @entity9			0
