by @entity1 reporter published : 21:29 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 04:57 est , 19 september 2013 three men have been charged with murdering a bright teenager just days before he was due to receive his gcse results			2
@entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are accused of killing 16 - year - old @entity8 , in east @entity9 , on august 12			1
they are also charged with the attempted murder of another 16 - year - old , @entity8 's friend , on the same night			1
@entity5 , 20 , and @entity7 , 22 , will appear at @entity14 later today			1
@entity8 , who was murdered in an apparently unprovoked attack , achieved eight grade as and three grade bs in his gcses @entity6 , 21 , will appear at the @entity19 on friday			1
a fourth man , 19 - year - old @entity20 , had already been charged by police over the attack and will appear before a court at a future date			1
@entity8 , described as a star pupil with ' a very bright future ' ahead of him , was stabbed after he and his friends were confronted by a gang in @entity28 , @entity29 , at 9.50pm on august 12			1
@entity8 was badly wounded , while a friend of the same age was also stabbed			1
both were taken to an east @entity9 hospital , where the keen boxer died			1
it was confirmed last month that @entity8 , who was described by his headteacher at @entity37 in @entity29 as ' one of our brightest pupils ' , achieved top grades in his gcses			1
the teenager achieved eight grade as in subjects including maths , science , @entity48 literature , geography , religious studies and citizenship ; and three b grades in @entity48 language , humanities and physical education			2
@entity8 was described as ' one of our brightest prospects ' by his headmaster at @entity37 in @entity29 shortly after his death his headteacher at @entity37 in @entity29 revealed he had been considering a career in medicine			1
speaking after the teenager 's gcse results were revealed , headteacher @entity63 said : ' one of the careers he was considering was in medicine , and these results would have made that a very real possibility in terms of university entrance			0
' all the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of his murder wanted to know how " good " he was as a student			0
' i was able to say without hesitation that he was very able , looking forward to @entity81 results at a very high level and very capable of going on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at any one of our best universities			0
' he said that he had interviewed @entity89 for a place in the school ’s new sixth form a few weeks ago , and that he would remember most ' how hardworking he was as a student , and how very decent he was as a person '			0
@entity8 's headteacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in @entity100 mr @entity63 went on : ' some youngsters as able as @entity8 do n’t ever realise their full potential because they are n’t prepared to do what ’s necessary to ensure success			2
some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness at the expense of other , less able students			0
@entity8 ’s approach was the opposite			2
' he would always have been the last person to boast of his ability			0
he regularly attended the extra classes and revision sessions run by his teachers , even when he probably did n’t need their help any longer			0
his friends could rely on him for help if they needed it , not for arrogance or scorn			0
' the teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in @entity100			0
mr @entity63 went on : ' we are constantly bombarded with negative stories about young people , about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour			0
working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years i have learned the opposite , that the vast majority of young people are in fact very decent , and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults			0
' our school , our community , our country has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly shocked and depressed by it			0
the best comfort we can take from it is that , for however a short a time , those of us that knew @entity8 knew a very splendid young man and a fine citizen			2
' police officers guard the scene where 16 - year - old @entity8 was allegedly stabbed sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1

@entity8 died after he was stabbed in the thigh in @entity29 , east @entity9
