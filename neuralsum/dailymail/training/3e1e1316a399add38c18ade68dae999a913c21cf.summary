a couple who have been holding hands for 700 years have been uncovered at a ' lost ' chapel in @entity4			0
the centuries - old skeletons were unearthed at the @entity6 , a site of pilgrimage in @entity8 during the 14th century			1
local volunteers had been digging the site , believed to be built on top of a @entity13 building , two weeks a year for four years			0
' the main thing is why were they buried out up there ? there is a perfectly good church in @entity8			1
was it a special place ? ' the chapel may have been an area of pilgrimage			1
alternatively , the bodies might have been refused burial in the main church , perhaps because they were criminals , foreigners or sick			2
the skeletons are both believed to be of a similar age , but ms @entity19 said further analysis is needed to know how old they were at the time of death			0

a number of silver pennies dating from between the 11th - 15th centuries have also been found on the site indicating when the chapel was in use			2
why people were buried at the @entity6 rather than in the main church in the village is unknown but it is possible that this was a special place of burial perhaps for pilgrims			1

one older male was killed by a sharp implement such as a pole axe to the head , presumably in battle			0
another young male was buried in a pit with his legs raised to his chest – possibly the result of a disease			0

a number of silver pennies dating from between the 11th - 15th centuries have also been found on the site indicating when the chapel was in use			2
