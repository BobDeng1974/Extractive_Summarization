by @entity0 published : 12:21 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 13:29 est , 28 january 2014 with just two months to go before the birth of her seventh child , @entity3 , 38 , from @entity5 in @entity6 , was looking forward to welcoming her new baby into the world			1
but tragically , the moment would never arrive			2
instead , after a harrowing two day ordeal which saw her repeatedly beaten and raped with an iron bar , @entity3 's baby was dead			1
why ? because her family and neighbours believed - wrongly - that she was a witch			1
endemic : a woman suspected of being a witch is burned alive after being gang raped in @entity5 @entity3 's @entity5 homeland is the capital of @entity6 's @entity24 , a place notorious for tribal violence , a ruthlessly applied system of ' payback ' and dangerously high levels of drink and drugs			1
it is also one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman , with a shocking 99 per cent of women thought to have suffered violence of some sort at some point in their lives			1
women are , according to locals , worth less than pigs , while many more fall victim to the same sort of superstitious belief as @entity3			1
in @entity5 , women suspected of being witches can be stoned , burned alive or even burned at the stake			1
@entity3 was at a family funeral when the phone call that would change her life forever was patched through			1
upsetting : @entity3 's story is all too common in @entity6 where violence against women is endemic prisoners : @entity57 talks to some of the men incarcerated in @entity60			1
many of the men are rapists @entity62 , @entity63 the war - torn @entity63 capital was deemed the world 's worst place to live by the economist 's @entity68			1
@entity70 , @entity71 extreme poverty combined with rickety infrastructure make the @entity71 capital a poor choice for a des res. @entity60 , @entity6 endemic violence of every sort imaginable plus terrible poverty			1
@entity79 , @entity80 the @entity82 metropolis was given the lowest stability score by the brains at the economist			2
@entity86 , @entity87 thanks to continuing economic and political crises , @entity86 is considered the fifth worst place to live			2
@entity91 , @entity92 terrorist groups prowl the streets while much of the beautiful old town has been destroyed by war and natural disasters			2
@entity98 , @entity99 frequent terrorist attacks combined with a sky high murder rate make @entity99 's second city a dangerous place to be			2
@entity104 , @entity105 the last two years have seen the @entity105 capital face regular outbreaks of violence and near - permanent protests			1
@entity110 , @entity111 @entity114 's wealthiest city it might be but health provision is terrible and crime just as bad			2
@entity117 , @entity118 although the @entity118 capital got high scores for health and education , its rickety infrastructure let the side down			2
source : economist @entity68 ' there was a phone call and the person on the phone said : " this dead person , whose funeral you 've just had , she 's the one who ate his heart " , ' she remembers			2
' that 's why they took me and tied my hands up with barbed wire			2
' at the time , she was seven months pregnant but even that was n't enough to save her from what followed			2
' i was strapped up with barbed wire , ' she recalls			0
' then they dragged me to the house and locked me inside			0
' they took my blouse , put a bush knife through my blouse , my skirt and my tights , took them off and threw them aside			0
one of them pulled my leg , one of them pulled the other and one man pushed my head back , and i stayed like that			0
i did n't do anything and i did n't move			0
' already bleeding from the cruel barbed wire and in terror for her life , @entity3 hoped that by doing nothing , the men might be persuaded to leave her alone			1
but worse was to come			0
' one of them split some firewood and made a fire outside , ' she says			0
' they heated up iron rods , spades and bush knives and when they were really hot , they came in and put them on my skin			0
' they damaged all my skin			0
they pushed an iron into my vagina			0
they tortured me for two days , ' she continues			1
' five times they pushed the rod into my vagina			0
the things they did to me ... they destroyed me			0
my vagina is still very sore			0
they shoved iron rods inside me			0
it 's totally destroyed my rectum and my vagina			0
' and @entity3 's story is by no means unique , as @entity57 , points out in the newest series of @entity196			1
@entity6 is home to endemic violence , fuelled by the tribal ' payback ' system and made worse by illegal moonshine , drugs and poverty			1
it 's capital , @entity60 , was recently declared one of the worst cities to live in on the planet by the @entity206 , with only @entity63 's war - torn capital @entity62 and @entity71 capital @entity70 deemed worse			1
one of the woman to brave the city is @entity211 of @entity212 , who in an interview with @entity57 , declared that violence has gone ' beyond epidemic levels			2
' ' every day there is a death , there is a rape , there is a killing , there is a murder , there is some sort of violence , ' she explained			1
' it 's like the whole system , the social structure is breaking down			0
' history : @entity6 gained independence from @entity235 in the 1970s and is part of the @entity237 tribes : the country has more than hundreds of different groups while 800 different languages are spoken for many , @entity3 among them , the damage is already beyond repair			1
her baby , just months from being born , was killed during the brutal attack while @entity3 herself is scarred for life and lives in fear of the men who beat her			1
' i was crying and i could n't stop , ' she says of the experience			0
' the pain was so severe , my baby died and i wanted to die			0
' i said : " do n't damage me anymore " but they would n't listen			0
so i asked them to cut my head off so i could go to @entity258 and not feel the pain anymore			0
' @entity57 : @entity196 , tonight at 9pm on @entity260			0

@entity3 , 38 , from @entity5 in @entity6 was tortured
two days of beatings and burnings killed her *unborn* child
*mother* - of - six now lives in fear of her attackers who are still at large
99 per cent of @entity5 women have suffered violence of some sort
according to locals , women there are worth less than pigs
