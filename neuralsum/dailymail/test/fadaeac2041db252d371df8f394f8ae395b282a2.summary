by friday afternoon that exchange had been upgraded by the @entity0 to a ' discussion ' secretary of state @entity54 and @entity4 foreign minister @entity113 - held talks at a @entity41 hotel on thursday night , the first meeting between the countries ' diplomats since 1958 president @entity1 , @entity54 and @entity146 president @entity145 participate in a multi-lateral meeting with @entity148 ( @entity148 ) presidents this afternoon @entity1 appears to be close to removing @entity4 from the @entity2 list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism			1
