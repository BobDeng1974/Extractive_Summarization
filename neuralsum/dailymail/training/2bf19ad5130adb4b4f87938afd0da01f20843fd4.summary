by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 20:39 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 16 november 2012 high street stores have slammed @entity3 over decision to impose a ' @entity5 ' on cheap cups , plates and bowls imported from @entity9			0
a new duty will come into force within 24 hours and add between 17.6per cent and 58.8per cent to the wholesale dockside price of the cheap imports			1
this could feed through to a 20 per cent increase in the price of a basic set of dinner plates , side plates and bowls in the shops			0
some 80 per cent of all @entity23 and @entity24 imports of crockery come from @entity9 , which benefits from low wages and production costs			1
the tax is expected to add £ 230million to importers ' costs the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) warned that the increase will inevitably drive up shop prices , particularly for value crockery which appeals to households on a tight budget			1
the move by the @entity38 is the latest in a number of trade measures designed to protect manufacturers in @entity24 against competition from cheap @entity9 imports			2
other targets have included shoes , bicycles , candles and even ironing boards			0
however , the net effect is to add to the cost of living for families hit by big increases in the cost of essentials from heat and light to food and petrol			2
it will also further drive up inflation in the @entity23 , which is already rising more quickly than the incomes of many households			2
anger at the move has been exacerbated because the @entity38 has given importers just 24 hours ' notice of the new taxes			1
the duties are the result of a nine - month investigation by the @entity38 into claims by an anonymous @entity24 manufacturer that @entity9 producers are selling these into the @entity74 at artificially low prices			1
the @entity74 market for ceramic tableware and kitchenware is worth £ 1.2billion with around half of that made up of products imported from @entity9			1
it is estimated that the duties will add £ 230million to importers ' costs which will be passed on to customers			1
the new is supposed to protect @entity74 producers but will negatively impact high street retailers director general of the @entity31 , @entity90 , said : ' this is the wrong decision badly handled			1
the principle here is that free trade is good for the customer			0
' let 's be clear – these new duties will feed through to higher prices in stores			1
and , because @entity9 mainly supplies the value end of the market , they will deny less well - off customers access to affordable crockery			2
' he added : ' the irony is ; making hard - pressed customers pay more will do nothing to support @entity24 producers who do n't have the capacity to produce enough at low enough prices			2
' our members tell us that the only alternative for them , if they 're forced to look elsewhere , will be to source from other low - cost asian countries			0
' what is particularly galling is that the @entity38 – unelected @entity117 – pressed ahead with this tax despite the majority of member states , including the @entity23 , voting against			0
' the way officials are treating businesses engaged in nearly three quarter of a billion euros of trade is utterly unacceptable			0
' how can companies be expected to plan millions of pounds worth of buying with no certainty about whether their costs will rocket overnight ? ' the @entity130 , which speaks for @entity23 manufacturers , said the decision by the @entity38 could help boost @entity23 production and jobs			1
its chief executive , dr @entity135 , said : ' a lot of manufacturing was outsourced to @entity9 about eight to ten years ago			0
the ceramic manufacturing industry in this country declined , but that has stabilised and the industry has fought back in recent years			0
' she gave the example of the famous @entity145 brand , which has brought the manufacture of some of its ranges back to @entity23 from @entity9			0
' this decision to apply duty on @entity9 imports may well result in more manufacturing coming back to the @entity23 , ' she said .			0

the @entity31 warned that the move will drive up shop prices
the @entity74 market for ceramic tableware and kitchenware is worth £ 1.2billion
it is estimated that the duties will add £ 230million to importers ' costs
