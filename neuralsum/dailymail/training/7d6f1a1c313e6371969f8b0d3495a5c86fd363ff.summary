a firm which supplied ducks for @entity3 's foie gras dishes appeared in court in @entity6 today accused of ' serious animal cruelty '			1
@entity8 , which is based in @entity10 , in the west of the country , is said to have kept birds in appalling conditions as it created the delicacy			2
if they become the first ever foie gras producer to be found guilty of animal cruelty , senior executives face prison sentences and fines of up to Â£ 25,000			1
@entity8 , based in @entity10 , west @entity6 , supplied foie gras to @entity3 and the @entity22 , is said to have kept birds in appalling conditions as it created the delicacy ( stock image ) videos offered as evidence in the high profile trial in @entity32 , in the @entity28 region , show ducks lying dead and dying in the same cage			1
many have chronic eye injuries and abscesses , and all are force - fed grain through a tube to make their livers 10 times the normal size			0
this happened during a two - week ordeal in a windowless shed before they were slaughtered , and used to make foie gras			1
on hearing of prosecution in 2013 , @entity3 cancelled all purchases from @entity8 , pending ' further investigations '			2
@entity8 also sold ducks to some of the best restaurants and hotels in @entity56 , including @entity58 's @entity57 , on the @entity22 , @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 's , on the @entity62			1
videos from insiede @entity8 's farm show ducks lying dead and dying in the same cage in one particularly disturbing scene in the video , an exhausted and clearly distressed duck can be seen lying on its back with its tongue hanging from its beak			1

an organisation called @entity81 initiated the case - the first in which a major foie gras producer has gone of trial for cruelty			2
ducked out : @entity8 supplied foie gras to @entity3 's restaurants ' it 's the first time gavage has gone on trial , ' said @entity81 in a statement , adding that the case would allow ' a wide - ranging discussion ' about gavage and ' the consequences it can have on the animal			1
' ' if the company is convicted , it will obviously affect the practice of gavage which is banned in numerous countries , " @entity97 , lawyer for @entity81 told the @entity99 news agency			0
but @entity103 , director general of @entity8 , insisted that the video was a fake			0
he added : ' @entity106 is not on trial			0
the question is was there cruelty or not ? we will show step by step , minute by minute that this is not the case			0
' we have factual evidence to show that the video is a montage , and not all of it was filmed at our plant			0
' the foie gras producer is counter suing @entity81 for trespass and damage to its property			2
mr @entity103 added : ' we are not barbarians - the video has damaged producers and created a climate of suspicion			0
' the @entity129 banned individual cages for birds in 2011 , but gave producers until the end of 2015 to install larger collective cages for the gavage			0
@entity6 produces almost three quarters of the world 's foie gras and has around 8,000 producers			1
