@entity0 ’s £ 59.7million signing @entity1 is set to break the @entity3 transfer record			1
it ’s a switch far removed from the one which took @entity7 south from @entity8 to @entity9 in 1905 , for the then princely sum of £ 1,000			0
@entity7 was @entity3 football ’s first grand star and he was the country ’s most expensive player for six years			2
the magic £ 100,000 barrier was n’t broken until the early 1960s , when @entity33 returned to @entity34 from @entity35 , with @entity0 paying £ 115,000 for the striker			0
@entity37 became football ’s first million pound player in 1979 as he joined @entity40 from @entity41			1
however , despite scoring a @entity43 final winner he never quite settled at the @entity44 and was later shipped off to @entity45 for another hefty fee			0
thanks a million : @entity37 ( left ) was the first £ 1m @entity3 player and scored a @entity43 - winning goal midfielders such as @entity49 and @entity50 have been the subjects of the record transfer fee but it is generally strikers for whom the big bucks are paid			1
but that was blown out of the water in 1996 when @entity57 joined his boyhood club @entity58 from @entity60 for a staggering £ 15m			1
just five years later , this record was nearly doubled as @entity63 midfielder @entity62 signed for @entity0 from @entity64			2
he was one of the stars of the world game but , after a lively start at @entity68 , flopped spectacularly			0
talk of the @entity70 : @entity57 broke the record in 1996 when @entity58 paid £ 15m for him record : when @entity73 paid £ 50m for @entity74 he beat the old record by more than £ 10m in 2002 , sir @entity76 broke the record once more at @entity0 and this signing was a big shock in terms of positioning as centre half @entity82 was bought from @entity84 for just over £ 29million			1
@entity85 became @entity3 football ’s first £ 30m signing in 2006 but possibly the most surprising fee paid for any player was the £ 35m forked out by @entity90 for @entity91 in 2011			1
his record at @entity93 never came close to justifying the fee			0
it may be a blessing for @entity91 that he held the record for a matter of hours as later on that same january day , @entity74 joined @entity73 for £ 50m			2
it has become a symbol of the folly of spending big towards the end of a transfer window			0
@entity0 must be hoping @entity104 ends up more like a @entity105 or a @entity57 than a @entity91 or a @entity74			2
disappointment : @entity62 was below par for @entity0 , despite being a record transfer signing			0

@entity1 on verge of @entity72 transfer from @entity21
@entity0 will pay £ 59.7m for the midfielder
@entity74 broke record when he moved from @entity90 to @entity73
@entity57 was the record *holder* when @entity58 paid £ 15m for him
@entity37 was @entity3 football 's first million - pound player
