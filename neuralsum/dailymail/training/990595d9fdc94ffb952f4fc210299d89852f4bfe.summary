by @entity0 published : 18:32 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 10 october 2013 new research claims that vitamin d supplements have no effect if you are taking them to prevent against osteoporosis taking vitamin d supplements does not improve bone strength and is a waste of time for women trying to stave off osteoporosis , claim researchers			1
a new review of studies involving more than 4,000 healthy adults concludes that supplements fail to increase the density of bone at the hip , spine , forearm , or in the body as a whole			1
taking steps to increase bone mineral density is widely thought to be essential in preventing fractures in later life			1
hundreds of thousands of women take supplements in the @entity30 either prescribed by their doctor for osteoporosis - thinning bones - or bought over the counter as ‘ bone insurance ’			1
professor @entity35 from the @entity36 in @entity37 , who led the study published in @entity40 medical journal , said close to half of adults aged 50 and older use vitamin d supplements , but for many people it will not make any difference			1
he said ‘ most healthy adults do not need vitamin d supplements			1
‘ our data suggest that the targeting of low - dose vitamin d supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare			2
’ prof @entity35 and colleagues carried out a systematic review of 23 randomised trials examining the effects of using vitamin d supplements to boost bone mineral density in 4,082 healthy adults aged 59 on average up to july 2012			1
the results did not show any effects for people who took vitamin d for an average period of two years , apart from a small increase in bone density at the femoral neck ( forming part of the hip joint )			1
but this change would be unlikely to provide any real medical benefits to the individual , says the report			0
according to the research the supplements do not improve bone strength it said ‘ this systematic review provides very little evidence of an overall benefit of vitamin d supplementation on bone density			1
‘ continuing widespread use of vitamin d for osteoporosis prevention in community - dwelling adults without specific risk factors for vitamin d deficiency seems to be inappropriate			0
’ @entity89 is essential for the immune system , strong healthy bones and teeth , and the absorption of calcium , and there is growing evidence that vitamin d deficiency may be responsible for triggering a range of diseases , including several cancers			2
the body makes most of its vitamin d from sunlight , although oily fish is a good dietary source			0
older women are more at risk of osteoporosis because the rate of bone loss is accelerated by the menopause			2
one in two women and one in five men over the age of 50 will break a bone mainly because of the disease			0
dr @entity118 , medical policy manager of the @entity119 said ‘ @entity89 is essential for good bone health			0
this latest study supports what the @entity119 has been saying for years : the best source for most people is safe summer sunlight exposure , and that only people at risk of vitamin d deficiency should take a supplement			2
‘ the @entity130 identifies the following groups pregnant and breastfeeding women , under 5s , people with darker skin , older people aged 65 and over and those with low or no exposure to the sun as being at risk of vitamin d deficiency			2
’ dr @entity141 , from the @entity142 , said ‘ @entity89 deficiency continues to be a major problem in the @entity30 where up to a quarter of adults have inadequate blood vitamin d levels , according to @entity149 data			0
‘ this is due to our turbulent weather and dark winters , which restrict how much vitamin d our bodies can make , as well as low intakes of oily fish which is the best natural source of vitamin @entity89 ‘ in terms of bone health , vitamin d promotes calcium absorption and its utilisation by bone , having the strongest impact on bone density when taken alongside dietary calcium			1
‘ therefore , it is unsurprising that the meta - analysis found no significant impact of vitamin d when taken alone			0
it is also worth remembering that vitamin d is needed for more than bone health			0
‘ emerging evidence suggests a role in immune function , maintenance of heart health and even prevention of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis			0
‘ this is why i disagree with the findings of the @entity40 study and would actually recommend that more people consider a daily vitamin d supplement , particularly with winter approaching			1
’ in the @entity30 , the @entity190 does not recommend a specific daily dose of vitamin d unless you are elderly , pregnant , @entity194 , get little sun exposure and eat no meat or oily fish when 10mcg is advised			0
it says daily supplements of 25mcg are unlikely to cause harm			0
the danger with taking excessive doses for long periods is that the body absorbs too much calcium , which could weaken bones and possibly damage liver and kidneys .			0

no increase in bone density according to study published in @entity40
hundreds of thousands of women take the supplements every *day*
according to expert most healthy people do not need to take vitamin d
