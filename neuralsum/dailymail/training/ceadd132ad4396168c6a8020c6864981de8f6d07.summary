by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 05:45 est , 4 june 2013 eight amazingly preserved log boats have been hailed as ‘ more important than the @entity2 ’ after being dug up from a silted - up river			1
the boats , the largest of them 28 feet ( 8.5m ) long , are thought to have been used for ferrying cargo and passengers in the @entity8 some 3,500 years ago			1
they are now being preserved for future study and as a tourist attraction using the same conservation techniques that saved the @entity2 from falling apart when raised from the @entity13			1
@entity14 , of the @entity15 and the log project 's conservationist , inspects one of the eight @entity20 log boats dug out of the ground at a quarry near @entity23			1
the vessels , thought to be up to 3,500 - years - old would most likely have been used to transport people and cargo the boats resemble those used during the annual @entity29 between @entity30 and @entity32 universities			1
although , the current international class eights race boats are more than twice the length of those found in @entity23 - at 19.9m long			1
log boats from the @entity20 have been found before but never have so many been found in the same place			1
‘ this is amazingly significant , ’ @entity14 , of the @entity39 and the log project ’s conservationist , told @entity42			2
‘ you normally get just the one boat			0
eight in one spot is phenomenal			0
‘ what ’s more , they were excavated under controlled archaeological conditions			0
normally you get them when there ’s pipe - laying going on , but we have been able give them the full works			0
‘ in terms of significance it ’s probably even bigger than the @entity2			0
’ one of the recovered log boats was decorated with a criss - cross pattern on both the inside and the outside of the vessel			1
it is uncertain whether there was any particular significance to the decoration or if the owner simply wanted to personalise it archaeologists said they provide an extraordinary window not just into boat - building and woodwork techniques of the @entity20 , but how human ingenuity overcame a changing environment			1
about 4,000 years ago rising sea levels caused wide areas of previously dry the land near @entity23 and further east to be flooded and turn into wetland			1
people living in the region faced a transformed landscape but , archaeologists said , the boats and other artifacts found at @entity86 and the surrounding area demonstrate they quickly adapted			1
the log boats discovered in @entity23 were a similar elegant shape to those used during the annual @entity30 and @entity91			1
the log boats are around 8.5m long whereas the international class eights boats are more than double this length , at 19.9m			1
this gives archaeologists clues as to how many people could sit in the log boat compared to modern - day vessels each of the boats was hewn from a single tree trunk , six of them oaks , one alder and one lime			1
and it is clear from the repair work and patches that have been found on each of the vessels that they were greatly valued by their owners			1
‘ they have all been used for a long time , ’ said mr @entity14			2
one has a clay lining which was added to make it watertight			0
one or two have had plugs of wood put in			0
’ the timbers were kept wet before archaeologists moved the boats from the mud to a purpose - built facility			2
techniques pioneered on the @entity127 warship are being employed to preserve the eight log boats			1
one of them was decorated with a pattern of crosses on the inside and outside of the log , but the significance is unclear			2
quite why each of them ended up at the bottom of an old course and now silted up course of the @entity140 remains a mystery			0
it appears that they were all , separately , sunk deliberately over a period of about 600 years when the transom board from the stern was removed			2
because of the way the boats were made , they had to have a transom fitted at one end to replace wood that would have rotted			2
all eight have been found with a slot for the transom board			2
‘ all the transom boards have been removed and we did n’t find them			0
that suggests they have been sunk intentionally , ’ said mr @entity14			0
it is the first time so many @entity20 log boats have been found so close together			1
usually log boats are found singly but at @entity163 there were eight , and they were all painstakingly excavated by archaeologists ‘ they have all been found at different depths within the channel			1
each one has been sunk at a different time – it was n’t a single episode			2
’ they could have been sunk as votive offerings to the gods or spirits , just as metal objects including swords and spears were in the same river			0
another theory is that they were sunk for the winter season to prevent them drying out and splitting , before being somehow forgotten or lost			0
or it could simply have been that the owner obtained a new vessel and decided it was time to get rid of the old one			0
the smallest of the eight boats is about 11.5 feet ( 3.5m ) long and little more than a foot wide ( 30 - 40cm ) , while the largest is 28 feet long and about 2.5 feet ( 75cm ) wide			1
the eight @entity20 boats have been moved to a purpose - built facility where they will be conserved			1
over the two - year project they will be sprayed with a special wax that will preserve the timbers mr @entity14 said all were likely to have been used to ferry passengers and cargo , with the largest able to transport about 15 people in one go			1
there are even indications that the 28 - foot vessel was cut down from an even bigger boat			2
it remains unclear how they were propelled but it is most likely that paddles were used , though none have been found			2
last week it was reported that @entity212 has recreated a 2,300 - year - old @entity214 log boat hand - carved from a tree trunk			1
more than 200 people helped fashion the one - tonne log boat over a three - week period from a section of fallen 80ft oak tree			2
@entity220 , a conservation technician , inspects one of the boats in cold storage			0
the boats , which can be viewed through glass panels by the public , has slots for transom boards and some of them had carrying handles the 15ft vessel is a scaled down copy of a 35ft @entity214 log boat discovered at the bottom of @entity236 almost 50 years ago			1
the original boat , discovered in 1964 , was discovered after routine dredging work but it is now only display at @entity241			0
visitors to @entity243 , the largest of eight islands in @entity236 , helped shape the flat - fronted boat using an adze , an ancient axe - like tool used for wood carving			0
the team restoring the @entity20 log boat believe the settlement was located about a third of a mile from where the eight log boats were found and other artifacts in the area include ceramics , tools , glass beads and eel traps were also located			1
last week it was reported that the @entity212 has constructed a 2,300 - year - old @entity262 log boat over the course of three weeks in tribute to the one discovered in @entity236 in 1964 ‘ it ’s telling us quite a lot about woodworking in the @entity20 , ' said mr @entity14			1
‘ i think we are looking at something which certainly from the construction of the vessels and the way they have been maintained , it was quite an advanced technology			0
the eight log boats are just some of the relics that are associated with the @entity276 landscape in the @entity20			1
about 4000 - years - ago sea level rises created a wetland and the people living there had to adapt to a new way of life			2
among the artefacts are the remains of a wooden causeway about 3,350 - years old that is considered to be as significant as @entity286			0
the causeway is about the size of @entity288 and was constructed over 400 years			0
on a neighbouring site was discovered the oldest knwon wheel in @entity291 and one of the most important collections of @entity20 swords and dirks			2
‘ they did n’t just stand in the water trying to fish			0
they knew how to trap them and were making ceramics and glass			0
’ the boats were discovered in 2011 at @entity86 clay quarry which supplies the brick - making industry			0
they have now been moved to a refrigerated unit at @entity276 , near @entity23 , where they are being sprayed with a specialised wax , polyethylene glycol , to protect the timber and where they can be viewed by the public			0
mr @entity14 added : ' to under take the conservation with the public able to view it and watch the process develop over the next few years is a great opportunity			0
' we 're keeping the boats wet and cold to help keep everything as it is - so there 's no biological activity to digest through the timber - to reduce decay of the wood			0
' @entity325 from @entity326 , one of @entity329 ’s leading prehistoric and wetland field archaeologists , said : ‘ it is tremendously important that the @entity86 boats were brought to @entity276 , because they are part of the same story			0
‘ the boats ’ arrival at @entity276 represents a kind of ‘ coming home ’ because both the boats and the causeway discovered at @entity276 in the 1980s and now on display to the public , represent novel kinds of conveyances in a landscape fast disappearing beneath rising waters			0

the boats , the largest of them 28 feet long , are thought to have been used for ferrying cargo and passengers in the @entity8 some 3,500 years ago
now being preserved for future study and as a tourist attraction
log boats from the @entity20 have been found before , but never have so many been found in the same place
each of the boats was hewn from a single tree trunk , six of them oaks , one alder and one lime
the log boats resemble the elegant vessels used in the annual @entity29 between @entity30 and @entity32 universities
