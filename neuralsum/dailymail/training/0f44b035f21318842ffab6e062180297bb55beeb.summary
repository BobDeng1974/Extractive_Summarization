succulent lobster , whether served with cream and brandy as a lavish thermidor or simply with butter , is the ultimate luxury dish , writes @entity6			1
yet this gourmet treat is suddenly cheap as chips - with supermarkets competing to sell it for the lowest price			1
budget chain @entity11 is offering entire frozen lobsters for £ 5.99 each , while @entity13 - which has started stocking the delicacy for the first time this week - is selling them at just £ 5			1
so why the sudden drop ? the reason appears to lie with climate change			2
as the sea temperatures rise , lobsters are hatching earlier and they are growing faster			1
also , the over-fishing of cod in the @entity32 means that fewer of these predatory fish are gobbling up baby lobsters			1
the result is that this ocean is now teeming with the tasty crustaceans			2
and it is these lobsters from @entity41 and @entity42 waters that are now being sold at rock - bottom prices in @entity45 stores			1
by contrast , lobsters from @entity49 waters still have a pricier tag : one from the @entity52 , for example , is likely to set you back upwards of £ 20			1
but are the cut - price varieties reduced in taste , too ? here , i test a range of supermarket lobsters and lobster tails and give my verdict , as a chef and seafood expert			1
all of the lobsters come from the freezer aisles , and while some are pre-cooked and others raw , i ’ve prepared them in the same way : by sautéing in a little butter			1
as sea temperatures rise , lobsters are hatching earlier and they are growing faster @entity13 @entity72 , 350g , £ 5			1
the lovely , coral - red shell makes for a fantastic centrepiece			2
the tail meat is mushy when it should be firm			2
i suspect the lobster was left out of the water too long before it was killed			1
the claw meat is usually my favourite because it ’s even sweeter and more tender than the tail , but this contains just a few strings of flesh reminiscent of tinned salmon			2
this lobster is not tasty enough as a stand - alone dish			1
but at a bargain price of £ 5 it ’s definitely not a disaster : i would happily use it for my favourite lobster spaghetti recipe			1
remove all the meat from the lobster and chop up the tail meat , but leave the claw intact			1
fry a small red onion and a sliced garlic clove in olive oil			2
after two minutes pour over 50ml of brandy , and flambé			2
once the flames die down , add two chopped beef tomatoes , four tablespoons of chopped parsley , four chopped basil leaves and another garlic clove			0
pop in the lobster meat and 150ml of dry white wine			1
simmer for 5 - 8 minutes until the juices reduce slightly			0
serve with 175g of cooked spaghetti			0
that ’s enough for two people			0
@entity118 ! 3/5 @entity11 @entity119 , 350g , £ 5.99			1
this lobster is crammed with meat and it ’s deliciously sweet			1
the shell cracks well when i bend it with my fingers and the flesh comes away easily from the tail , which shows it ’s really fresh			0
if the lobster ’s out of the water for too long before it ’s killed , the flesh shrinks away			1
budget chain @entity11 is offering its frozen ' @entity119 ' for just £ 5.99 each the claws are full of delicious , tender flesh			1
it ’s so good , you do n’t need to do a thing to it			0
it reminds me of a lovely lobster supper i recently enjoyed in @entity143 under the stars			1
i just poured myself a glass of @entity146 and got stuck in			0
5/5 @entity147 @entity148 & @entity149 cooked @entity42 lobster , 425g , £ 9.99			1
this is the biggest lobster by far , so i was expecting a feast			1
the claws are virtually empty — i have to dig around to get even a sliver of meat			0
and the meat in the tail is unpleasantly chewy			0
it ’s like gnawing on a skipping rope			0
sadly the best thing to do with this lobster is use it for stock			1
put the head and shell into a pan , cover with water , add a tablespoonful of brandy , splash of tomato puree and handful of dried herbs then cook very gently for two hours			0
but what a waste when for the same money you can buy two juicy lobster tails ( see @entity179 below )			1
1/5 @entity180 @entity181 , 350g , £ 8			1
this is so mushy , it ’s like chewing a wodge of cotton wool — and just as flavourless			0
the packaging says the lobster has been blanched for 1 - 2 minutes ‘ just long enough for the meat to separate from the shell — the secret of perfect texture and tasty meat ’			1
well something ’s gone wrong			0
i have to prise the meat out			0
it ’s not tasty and the texture is terrible			0
it ’s also watery — a sign the lobster was left out of salt water for too long before cooking because the fishermen simply did n’t take enough care			1
1/5 twist the claws of a cooked lobster to remove them from the body			1
insert a sharp knife into the back of the head and slice down to the tail to cut in half			0
remove and dispose of the pale sac , gills in head area and dark intestinal thread that runs the length of the body			0
remove any green meat - this is ‘ tomalley ’ , the lobster ’s digestive system and perfectly edible			1
retailers have drp [ [ ed the price of lobster because the wholesale costs have plunged by an astonishing 70 per cent in recent years remove any red meat , too - these are immature eggs and are a delicacy , a sort of lobster caviar			1
put both in a bowl			0
combine an egg yolk with a dash of double cream , a teaspoon of brandy and teaspoon of @entity240 mustard			0
whisk until you have a foamy consistency			0
add the meat and season			0
then pour the foam over the pre-cooked lobster , shell side down			2
pop under a hot grill until golden brown — about three minutes			0
enjoy ! @entity250 ’s taste the @entity251 , 380g , £ 10			2
this lobster may have been freighted in frozen from @entity42 but it looks so fresh it could have come straight from @entity253 in @entity254			1
this is exactly how good lobster should be — packed with meaty flavour			2
being raw , it ’s easier to prepare than a cooked lobster , which can end up overcooked unless you ’re happy to serve it totally cold			2
i ’d cut this in half and fry in butter with a couple of crushed garlic cloves for around five minutes			0
it ’s ready the second the meat starts to shy away from the shell			0
4/5 @entity179 specially selected @entity272 with @entity273 ( available from december 21 ) , £ 9.99 for a 260g pack of two			2
these are really yummy — sweet and tasty and exactly what you expect from really good lobster tails			2
the garlic butter is excellent , and they pan-fry in under five minutes			0
with double the number of tails , you get a serious amount of top - quality meat for your money — at least enough for two hungry people			0
a pot of mayo , a platter of chips and a bottle of chilled dry white , and you have the perfect ‘ date night ’ feast			0
on the downside , you lose the wow factor of a whole lobster			2
3/5 @entity13 @entity298 , £ 7 for a 200g pack of two			2
there are barely a couple of mouthfuls in each tail , and the meat is so rubbery i could be chewing on my bathtime rubber duck			0
the instructions say to fry in the butter supplied			0
the butter has a horrid salty aftertaste and i need a pitcher of water to wash it away			0
you ’d be better using your own butter			0
for extra flavour , add a chopped garlic clove			0
