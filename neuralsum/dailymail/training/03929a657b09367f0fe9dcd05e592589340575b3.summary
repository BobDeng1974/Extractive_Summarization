by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 20:08 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 20:10 est , 28 december 2012 generous : @entity1 argued @entity2 has a ' moral obligation ' to help the world 's poorest just one in four people support @entity2 spending billions of pounds on ­ foreign aid every @entity7 more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted , according to a poll			1
the finding is a major blow to @entity1 , who is committed to protecting international development from budget cuts			1
it follows a spate of stories linking @entity2 's aid spending to corruption or waste			1
spending on development by the @entity21 is set to rise to £ 11.3billion next year			1
only 6 per cent of people in the @entity24 poll strongly disagreed with the idea that foreign aid is wasted			1
a further 20 per cent tended to disagree with the statement			0
together the total of 26 per cent is little more than a quarter of the public			0
but 61 per cent said that development money is being wasted			2
despite the lack of support , mr @entity1 made a passionate defence of his target of spending 0.7 per cent of the @entity2 's income on foreign aid			1
the decision will require an increase of 30 per cent in 2013 from £ 8.65billion this year			2
mr @entity1 acknowledged it was ' difficult ' to persuade the public that increasing aid was the right thing to do at a time of cutbacks at home			0
but he insisted that the rise was in @entity2 's wider interests , as well as being morally right			1
he said : ' it can sometimes be a difficult argument , because we 're having tough times here at home , we 're having to make difficult decisions , but @entity2 is an incredibly generous country			2
' in @entity54 , a senior source said there was growing alarm among officials about the ability of the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) to manage next year 's aid budget increase			2
there are fears the result will be a rise in waste and corruption			0
' it 's not so much the scale of the spending , but the pace it is being pushed through at , ' the source said			2
' there are real questions whether any department can safely handle such a rapid increase in spending			0
' but mr @entity1 said @entity2 had a ' moral obligation ' to assist the poorest parts of the world and that specific programmes , such as those directed at tackling disease or child malnutrition , had tangible benefits			1
the prime minister added that it is in @entity2 's self - ­ interest to invest in nations such as @entity89 ' to make sure countries do n't break down and we do n't suffer from problems of mass migration and pandemics , problems of climate change '			1
repeated instances : the @entity98 has reported on aid being wasted or used doubtfully however , mr @entity1 acknowledged that aid can involve ' difficult decisions ' as he explained the recent decision to wind down the £ 280million a year aid programme to @entity103			1
the move followed public concern over the handout to a nation now wealthy enough to have its own space programme			0
he said : ' there does come a time when you have to recognise a country like @entity103 is becoming a middle - income country			2
' while i know there are still very many very poor people in @entity103 , increasingly , the @entity103 government is investing money in poverty alleviation itself			0
' what we should be doing is offering expertise and help , rather than money			0
' self interest : the @entity126 said without aid countries like @entity89 could ' cause problems for us at home ' the @entity98 has reported on repeated instances of aid being wasted or used doubtfully , including £ 30million sent to @entity133 – the world 's second - largest economy – to plant trees , and £ 10million marked to combat poverty in @entity138 ending up in private bank accounts			1
a further £ 270million set for @entity141 came under question as criticism grew of president @entity144			0
the payments are now suspended			0
the @entity146 warned recently in a report that plans for a vast hike in aid to @entity150 – which is set to become the biggest recipient of @entity2 money – should be ' approached cautiously '			1
' we note that @entity59 has no track record of delivering programmes in @entity150 on the scale that is now contemplated , ' the report warned			0
@entity158 of @entity24 said the strength of feeling revealed by the poll of 1,002 people showed politicians should be ' realistic about how far opinion can be shifted ' on aid .			0

more than 60 per cent believe cash @entity2 gives to others is wasted
it is a major blow for the @entity126 with spending set to rise £ 11.3bn next year
the @entity172 *leader* argued @entity2 has a ' moral obligation ' to provide aid
he said it is in the country 's own self - interest to help world 's poorest
