this is the remarkable moment a man paralysed for 10 years walked with the help of a robotic skeleton			1
@entity4 broke his neck and badly damaged vertebrae in a car crash on in january 2005			1
he was left with no mobility below his chest and severely restricted arm movement			1
now , however , a robotic skeleton has given him the ability to walk			1
hope : @entity4 , who has been paralysed for a decade since a car crash , walks using a robotic skeleton to celebrate his 32nd birthday , mr @entity4 was able to try on equipment that could change his life for the better			1
the @entity19 robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position , allowing the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches			1
the futuristic bionic ' exo - skeleton ' is a prototype made by @entity29 - based company @entity28			2
the suit can be bought at a cost of £ 90,000 by individuals or from hospital trusts later this month , with the chance of users being able to have private sessions estimated at a price of £ 200			1
the @entity19 robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position			1
it allows the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches			0
@entity19 users move from their chair into @entity19 , strap themselves in and control their movements using a joystick and control pad			0
the equipment weighs 38kg ( 84lb ) and is individually made for each user			0
it is powered by a lightweight , long - life rechargeable battery			0
it is strapped tightly to the legs and around the waist uses joysticks to control the speed and direction of movement			1
because mr @entity4 is quadriplegic , he can not use other devices that require upper body strength			1
speaking about the experience , he said : ' i 'm always open to the possibility of new things , so i was happy to be the guinea pig			0
' when you 're sitting down all the time , it 's a refreshing change to be on eye level with people			0
' i was a bit unsure about how my legs would take it because i get spasms , but i was surprised how easy it was to use and the movement it gave ' i 've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good			2
' mr @entity4 , a teaching assistant , featured in a promotional video filmed at the @entity82 in @entity83			2
challenge : mr @entity4 said he he was ' happy to be the guinea pig ' and was always ' pen to the possibility of new things '			2
' i 've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good ' it is hoped the exoskeleton could offer increased independence to wheelchair users , as well as helping people do jobs that are too restrictive in a wheelchair			0
@entity99 , chief executive of @entity28 , said : ' while @entity19 will not offer the same functionality as before , for the right person , it can offer a big increase in their quality of life			0
' it lifts them gradually from their wheelchair and when they stand it 's emotional			0
' one man who had been unable to walk for 20 years brought all his friends when he used @entity19 for the first time			2
' one of them who 'd known him for years said he had n't realised how tall he was			0
