forget @entity0 , welcome to @entity1			0
@entity2 might not be at one of the world ’s biggest clubs anymore but he has moved to the one with the sixth - best youth academy in @entity7			1
he made his name at @entity9 for developing young talent and according to @entity11 ( @entity12 ) there are only five better youth systems in @entity7 than @entity16 ’s talent factory at ‘ @entity17 ’			1
here @entity18 looks at the famed academy ; at three of the players @entity2 now inherits ; and at three of its all - time greats			1
@entity2 poses with a @entity16 scarf as he was unveiled as the club 's new manager last thursday @entity2 ( right ) alongside @entity16 president @entity26 ( left ) and director general @entity27 the new @entity16 boss was in high spirits as he oversaw his first training session in @entity31 last week three from the past @entity32 the @entity35 midfielder ’s father @entity33 also came through the club ’s youth system although by the time @entity39 ’s current seven pitch facility was built in 1982 he was already in the first team helping the side win the league			1
like father like son , @entity32 and his brother @entity43 learned their trade in the youth categories of @entity16			1
@entity32 almost emulated his father ’s title win but the team finished second in 2003 and he left for @entity52 at the end of the following season			0
he went on to win the @entity55 twice as well as the @entity56 and the @entity57			0
adored by fans of @entity59 they still hope he will choose to finish his career at @entity62 when his @entity64 adventure comes to an end			0
@entity32 came through the youth system at @entity16 and made his @entity68 debut in 2001 the 32 - year - old currently plies his trade in @entity64 with @entity35 ( left ) after leaving @entity71 ( right ) the midfielder , who has featured for @entity73 ( left ) 114 times , joined @entity52 from @entity16 in 2004 @entity75 @entity77 fans will remember @entity78 best for palming @entity80 ’s cross straight into the path of @entity82 who scored to give them their greatest ever @entity56 finals result			1
that shock , in the 1982 @entity56 , was all the bigger for having come against one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the time			0
@entity78 came through the @entity39 academy and played in both of @entity16 ’s @entity55 winning campaigns in 81 and 82			1
he was the keeper who conceded fewest goals in @entity68 for three seasons running from 1980 to 1982 and won 68 caps for his country appearing in two @entity97 and two @entity98			0
he also played 551 games for @entity16			2
his son , also called @entity75 , works in the media department of the club and helped @entity2 through his first few days in @entity31 last week			1
@entity75 played in both @entity16 's league title - winning seasons in 1981 and 1982 the goalkeeper conceded thefewest goals in @entity68 for three seasons running between 1980 and 1982 @entity108 the latest gem to come from @entity39 left last summer moving to @entity110 for a record £ 23.8million fee			1
after a superb season at @entity62 and a fine @entity56 for @entity116 the young @entity114 - @entity113 winger could no longer be expected to play his football outside of the @entity55 and @entity16 cashed in			1
@entity108 was signed aged 13 after the club ’s chief scout in @entity116 @entity120 spotted him and managed to make him switch to @entity73 before @entity121 could grab him			0
he was at @entity122 for five years before he made it to @entity59 ’s b - team and then , in 2009 , he debuted in the first team			0
last season he scored 20 goals in 50 games and carried the team through what was a troubled campaign before he became the club ’s most expensive transfer ever			0
@entity108 scored 20 goals for @entity16 last season , his final one with the club following that successful season @entity108 moved to @entity137 champions @entity110 for £ 23.8m @entity2 ’s @entity138 @entity12 ranked @entity39 sixth in the world in 2014 according to the number of homegrown players at the club or currently playing at another big - 5 club			1
@entity144 came out on top with @entity146 and @entity71 in second and third			2
but after @entity121 and @entity147 , @entity16 came in alongside @entity113 cousins @entity149			1
the latter have maintained their @entity113 - only player policy so their place in the list is not unexpected but @entity154 remain in the top six despite allowing foreign players since 1989			1
@entity16 have 15 players in their own squad that are homegrown and nine who are currently plying their trade in another big club in @entity7			1
@entity2 ( far right ) addresses his new squad , that include 15 homegrown players , at a training session last week three for the future @entity165 at just 21 @entity165 is one of the gems of @entity39 and he showed what confidence he has last april when he made his first team debut and tried to lob @entity170 keeper @entity169 with practically his first touch in @entity68			1
the effort went wide but his 16 - minute cameo was enough to convince @entity16 fans that he can push on this season			2
his chances have been few and far between so far as previous manager @entity178 preferred more experienced players as he clung to his job but he did give him another chance coming off the bench against @entity183 and he responded with an 82nd minute goal only for @entity16 to then concede twice in injury time and lose the game			2
comfortable on the right of the three behind the striker or playing off the left wing and shooting off of his favoured right foot he had both @entity71 and @entity144 watching him last season and looks ready to give @entity2 the dynamism he will want from his team			2
he is also not the only flying winger @entity2 can call upon from the @entity16 b - team			1
@entity197 is also just 21 and only just behind @entity165 in terms of development			0
@entity200 ( right ) has made three appearances for @entity16 this season @entity202 no - one has excited locals watching the young talents at @entity122 in recent years as much as @entity202 who @entity71 bid £ 8m for before he had even made his first team debut			2
@entity202 won the @entity209 with @entity73 and looked set to become the lynchpin in @entity16 ’s midfield for years to come			2
aged 22 he is still yet to fulfil that enormous potential but the club showed they continue to believe in him last season when they extended his deal to 2018 and kept his £ 23.8m buy - out clause			2
he also has a special ‘ @entity220 ’ clause set at 60m preventing the neighbours from pinching the current @entity73 under - 21 international			0
he might need to toughen up to fit @entity2 ’ profile of the perfect central midfielder but thanks to years on the training pitches of @entity39 all the technical qualities are in place			0
@entity202 was the subject of an £ 8m bid from @entity71 before making his first - team appearance @entity230 the 22 - year - old right back started out as an attacking midfielder when he joined the club as a 14 - year - old			0
he still carries a threat striding forward but has turned himself into a compact and reliable right - back			0
he is another who the club have tied to a contract that takes him up to 2018 and he has started nine games this season			0
there were suggestions in the summer that when @entity16 finally made their loan deal for the former @entity248 forward @entity246 permanent , @entity245 asked after the possibility of including the young defender in the transfer			0
ultimately @entity16 resisted , seeing the full - back as integral to the future of their defence			2
@entity230 ( left ) chases down @entity144 forward @entity255 during a @entity68 clash in february			0

the @entity16 youth academy is the sixth - best in @entity7 according to @entity11
former @entity146 boss @entity2 took charge of the @entity113 club last week
