by @entity0 published : 10:15 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 01:26 est , 27 june 2012 painted black and camouflaged 15ft up in a tree , this traffic camera is likely to be spotted by only the most eagle - eyed of drivers			2
the trap , which is hidden on a bend in the road by a busy railway station , has caught 1,500 people driving in a bus lane in only one week since it was turned on			1
they now face fines of £ 30 , or £ 60 if not paid in a fortnight – so the local council is making between £ 45,000 and £ 90,000 from the camera in just a week			0
' cash cow ' : residents say the bus lane camera , marked with an arrow , is hard to see because it is hidden behind a tall tree			1
fines totalling up to £ 90,000 were issued in a single week to motorists who used the lane the bus - lane camera was put up on a stretch of road close to @entity26 railway station , where cars have been banned			1
council officials said it was needed because the road had become a dangerous ‘ rat run ’			0
but angry locals say the camera is the sneakiest in @entity33 and accuse officials of deliberately hiding it to make as much money as possible from drivers			0
resident @entity38 said the hidden camera was a ‘ scandal ’ , adding : ‘ this is n’t about road safety , it is about revenue generation			0
hidden : the camera , which is hard to distinguish from the tree , caught 1,500 motorists using the bus lane in one week ‘ this must bring glee to the genius who came up with the idea as they [ drivers ] will all be fined thanks to the hidden enforcement camera , tucked away behind a tree			1
’ @entity59 , who works in the area , added that the camera ‘ must be a real money spinner ’ , while @entity62 said : ‘ it ’s that time when budgets have to be used up and mad plans are hatched to do so			0
’ but @entity65 said the design of the camera had been approved by the @entity67 and was ‘ perfectly legal ’			0
out of view : @entity65 said it installed the camera because residents complained the road was becoming a ' rat run ' a spokesman said residents had been warned about the camera and that it was put in place for the benefit of those who live in the area			1
the first week of fines followed a four - week ‘ amnesty ’ period after the bus lane opened when drivers received warning letters , rather than fines			1
@entity85 councillor @entity84 said : ‘ we sent thousands of warning letters to drivers who encroached on the bus lane			2
that shows our intention is not to use this as a cash cow			2
‘ the camera has been put in a place where it is not unsightly			0
signs are up warning drivers about it			0
’ obscured : motorists have been warned about the camera 's position , the council said unpopular changes : the bus lane restrictions have caught out motorists driving near @entity26 railway station ( pictured )			1
