@entity0 finished off a sumptuous move in some style as @entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 1 at @entity5 on sunday			1
the @entity7 midfielder latched onto @entity9 's lofted pass , and twisted his body to volley a spectacular effort past despairing goalkeeper @entity12			0
we 're not calling it an ' overhead kick ' , but his finish was sublime			0
so , what other scissor kicks have we seen over the years ? @entity0 fires home a spectacular effort for @entity3 against @entity4 on sunday the @entity20 's goal was the second of his double and secured a 2 - 1 victory for @entity25 's side @entity26 ( @entity27 vs @entity28 , 1999 ) as casual as it was genius			1
when @entity31 lifted the ball into the box , he would not have imagined the enigmatic @entity35 forward would have executed the volley to find the corner			0
@entity26 's scissor kick flew past @entity28 goalkeeper @entity39 , and deservedly won @entity27 's player of the season award			1
his goal of the season gong for 1999/00 in the @entity44 was no surprise , either			2
@entity26 watches on after guiding home a wonderful scissor kick for @entity27 against @entity28 the @entity35 forward 's strike was named goal of the season in the 1999/00 @entity44 campaign @entity53 ( @entity54 vs @entity55 , 1999 ) @entity26 's effort was n't the only scissor kick of that particular @entity44 season			1
on the first day of the campaign , the @entity60 midfielder sprinted to meet @entity63 's lofted pass and spectacularly volleyed home			0
his goal was one of four at @entity67 against the hapless @entity55			0
and that was n't the last time @entity55 fans would lose their cool with @entity53			2
@entity73 ( @entity72 vs @entity74 , 2001 ) @entity73 's scissor kick was one that we had n't seen before , and have n't seen since			1
standing upright , similar to @entity26 and @entity53 , the @entity72 star side foots his volley into the top corner			1
the @entity83 faithful have seen several special players this century , but not many goals as unique as this ( 3minutes , 10 seconds )			0
@entity87 ( wales vs @entity88			2
1985 ) @entity89 3 - 0 @entity88			0
a day that will long live in the memories of @entity93 supporters , thrashing the @entity95 runners - up in @entity96			0
and not only was it an historic day for the team , @entity87 ' goal in his hometown will never be forgotten			2
the ball spins back to the now - @entity103 manager who acrobatically fires it home from shoulder - height , thundering into the top corner			2
@entity87 ' spectacular strike helped @entity89 to a emphatic 3 - 0 victory against @entity88 in 1985 @entity110 ( @entity109 vs @entity111 , 1993 ) @entity113 fans will have seen many special @entity110 strikes in @entity115 over the years , but this effort in @entity35 may have gone under the radar			1
in the last 32 of the @entity120 , the 24 - year - old @entity119 striker showed incredible technique from the edge of the box to divert this wayward pass into the bottom corner			0
@entity126 ( @entity127 vs @entity128 2015 ) the former @entity4 striker has now forged his legacy at @entity127 with the winner in @entity132 on sunday night , but as recently as last month , @entity126 was struggling to hit top form at the @entity134			1
this effort after @entity137 's dinked cross in a 5 - 0 victory helped things though , and he has scored seven goals since			2
@entity126 bends back to fire home a scissor kick during @entity127 's 5 - 0 victory against @entity128 last month @entity144 ( @entity4 vs @entity145 , 2012 ) @entity144 has endeared himself to @entity4 fans defensively , and is now struggling on loan at @entity55			1
so this acrobatic attempt against @entity145 certainly came out of the blue			0
his first goal for the club , the centre half jogged up for a corner and his volley flew past @entity156 in goal			0
however , his flaws at the back were later highlighted as the hosts at @entity161 came back to win 3 - 2			2
@entity144 netted his first goal for @entity4 against @entity145 in 2012 - a stunning volley past @entity156 @entity164 ( @entity165 vs @entity166 , 2014 ) down to the @entity167 now , and with runaway leaders @entity165			1
four months ago , the @entity169 took just 111 seconds to net first against @entity166			0
@entity170 target man @entity164 lashed home a magnificent scissor kick , sending the @entity174 faithful wild			1
@entity175 ( @entity4 vs @entity176 , 2006 ) the scissor kicks of all scissor kicks			1
@entity175 's semi-overhead effort defied belief			0
it was his 10th goal in eight starts for club and country , as @entity4 hung on to a 3 - 2 victory against the @entity187 side in the @entity188			1
@entity189 will take credit with the assist ... @entity175 uses his large frame to execute a perfect scissor kick against @entity176 in 2006 the @entity4 striker and team - mates could barely believe it after his stunning goal at @entity5 @entity197 ( @entity198 vs @entity199 , 1986 ) it does n't get much better than scoring at the @entity202 finals			1
after taking two touches to bring the ball down , @entity197 fed @entity205 and then met the quick return pass with a mesmeric left - foot volley which had the host nation in raptures .			0

@entity0 scored two goals as @entity3 beat @entity4 2 - 1
second strike from @entity0 at @entity5 on sunday was superb scissor kick
@entity26 , @entity53 and @entity175 have netted similar strikes
@entity87 , @entity126 and @entity110 also make the list
