a great grandmother has called in police after being plagued by anonymous letters criticising her appearance and calling her a ' council house hussy '			1
@entity5 , 76 , says the poison pen letters , one of which is typed and the others handwritten , started when she rejoined a pensioners ' club in her home village of @entity13 , near @entity14 , @entity15			1
the retired dinner lady called in police after receiving four letters taunting her about her appearance and calling on her to leave the @entity20 club which meets fortnightly at the @entity21 near her home			1
great grandmother @entity5 , 76 , called in police after receiving anonymous letters criticising her @entity26 symbol : the first letter arrived last november , when mrs @entity5 had let her club attendance lapse officers have taken fingerprints from the letters and have asked all members of the club , which mrs @entity5 has recently started attending again after lapsing for a while , for samples of their handwriting			1
the first letter , which was typed , arrived at the bungalow mrs @entity5 shares with husband @entity38 , 81 , last november , the day after she had had an operation which meant she had n't attended the club for a while			1
it read : ' we are all glad you have left the club			2
you are a mouthy , vindictive council hussy			1
you can take the hussy out of a council house but you can not take the council house woman and make her a silk purse ! ! ! ' and the letter ended with a devil symbol			1
determined not to let the anonymous bully win , mrs @entity5 , who has three children , three grandchildren , and two great - grandchildren , started going to the club again			1
there are 23 members , all of them women in their 60s and 70s , and they organise events and trips including bingo , day trips to the seaside , quizzes and guest speakers			0
this february a second letter arrived , this one handwritten			0
it read : ' some of us are not best pleased that you are back ( 55s ) , you always was bolshi [ sic ] and liked your own way even at school			0
' you are like mutton dressed as lamb in your charity shop clothes			1
' in june a third letter , also handwritten , and riddled with spelling mistakes , arrived for mrs @entity5			1
calling her a ' harridan ' , it said : ' you are cheap as chips with your cheap jewellery			0
your hair looks as though it has been cut with a knife and fork			2
' then a fourth , handwritten , letter arrived , purporting to be from someone else as it begins : ' hi , it 's my turn			2
' the @entity95 club meets fortnightly at the @entity21 not far from mrs @entity5 's bungalow the letter goes on : ' you would be surprised at what we get to know about you ' and continues by calling mrs @entity5 a ' selfish gobby b * * * * ' and telling her to ' keep away ' from the club where she has served on the committee			1
one of the letters ended with three kisses , while others included personal comments about mrs @entity5 's husband and relatives			1
mrs @entity5 said : ' some of the things in the letters are unbelievable - they are absolutely horrible and really upsetting			1
' i think there is a jealous person behind all this , but it 's caused me real heartache and sleepless nights , as well as stress			0
' when i go out of my home i am always looking over my shoulder , wondering if the perpetrator is following me like a stalker			0
' she believes the sender of the letters is not a member of the club , but someone in the village , possibly a former member of the club or someone who knows one			2
' the former dinner lady has called in police and says she has her suspicions about who the culprit may be ' they say things like no - one likes me , and talk about my buying things from charity shops			1
it is running me down			0
' when i first got the letters i said i was n't going to the club any more , but my friend said if i stopped going then this person had won			2
so i 'm still going			0
' she said other people in the area unconnected with the over- 55s club had received similar poison pen letters about four years ago			2
' one neighbour came to read my letters and he said straight away it was the same handwriting as on the letters he received all that time ago			0
' one 79 - year - old club member said : ' we just have n't a clue where these letters are coming from			1
' i ca n't believe it is a member of our club			2
we sit and chat , have a game of dominoes or bingo and wile away a couple of hours			0
we also arrange outings - they are a nice set of ladies			0
' i have seen the letters and they are quite nasty and very personal			0
it is obviously somebody that knows @entity5 well who is very vindictive			0
' mrs @entity5 said : ' it is definitely somebody who knows me and my family really well			1
i have my suspicions but i ca n't prove anything			0
if i had anything to say to someone i would say it to their face			0
i ca n't understand it			0
' a @entity189 spokesman said : ' we have received reports of a 76 - year - old woman receiving distressing letters from an unknown person			2
officers are continuing their inquiries			0
