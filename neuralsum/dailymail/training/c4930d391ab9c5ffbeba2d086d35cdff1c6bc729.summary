an @entity1 student who claims she was raped by another undergrad after playing a drinking game , says she was ' ignored ' and pressured into dropping the charges			1
writing under an assumed name , the student known as ' @entity6 ' says she was raped in her second year after passing out in her own bed due to the effects of alcohol			1
she claims that the man bragged about it at dinner the next day , but police pressured her into dropping the charges and advised her to drink less in the future			1
writing under the name ' @entity6 ' , the @entity18 university student says she was raped in her sleep the student also slammed judge @entity23 's controversial comments which suggested the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stopped drinking so heavily			1
ms @entity6 said : ' judge @entity23 's recent comments about rape convictions are outrageous , but to me they are also personal			1
' i was raped while passed out in my bed			1
yes , my unconsciousness was due to alcohol			2
' poker rapidly descended into a drinking game and i , being a fatal combination of bad at poker and intolerant of alcohol , passed out			1
i have since learnt that i was put to bed , but i do n't remember anything			2
then a guy i did n't know had sex with me in my sleep			0
' i have one very clear memory which still haunts me two years later			0
@entity45 slammed judge @entity23 's suggestion that the rape conviction rate would not improve ' until women stop getting so drunk ' ' i remember waking up during the night and seeing him on top of me , my trousers around my ankles and my shirt still on			1
i pulled away and heard him mutter ' oh no , it fell out ' to himself , at which point i blacked out again			0
i assume he continued to rape me			2
' she says that when she plucked up the courage to go to the police station , a receptionist insisted that she gave the details of the rape in front of everyone in the waiting room			1
two officers then came to her house , where she was questioned further			0
she said : ' one described rape as ' just something that happens ' , especially at university			2
the only advice i received was to drink less in future			2
' ms @entity6 then claims she was forcefully questioned by a woman who concluded that because she was drunk she would not be able to prove anything in court			1
' the woman insisted on me deciding whether or not to press charges immediately , ' she said			2
' still shaken and vulnerable , i was in no position to make such a decision on the spot , and frankly her description of the court process scared me			0
it was little wonder , then , that i dropped it			0
the president of the @entity88 , @entity87 , 21 , was cleared of rape allegations in june this year ' i was not allowed to leave the kitchen until i had made my decision			2
she did n't fail to emphasise how traumatic i would find the process or her certainty my case would not stand up in court : i would be unable to prove i was unconscious at the time or that i did n't drunkenly consent			0
' the female officer allegedly said that there was not enough evidence , even though photos and videos had been taken of her by friends which showed her unconscious on the floor and bed			1
ms @entity6 said : ' had the police cared enough they could have acquired @entity109 , but the woman told them to return the clothes , bedsheets and used condoms i had given them			1
' these all provided incontrovertible evidence that the guy had sex with me			0
in fact , given his bragging at dinner the following day , this was never really in question			0
' i lost the poker , ' he said , ' but i did pretty well if you know what i mean			0
just typing that today sickens me			0
' the @entity131 1956 lists ' evidence that by reason of drink , the complainant was unaware of what was occurring and / or incapable of giving valid consent ' as a means by which to establish rape			1
a spokeswoman from @entity140 said : ' if a person if unhappy with the service they have received then we would invite them to make an official complaint to our quality of service department			0
all the details are on the website			0
' ms @entity6 says that she was largely ' ignored ' by the welfare officers at her college at @entity1 the student says that when she spoke to the welfare staff at her @entity18 college she was largely ignored and her alleged attacker received a minor reprimand and no further repercussions			1
she said : ' my @entity18 college , when i spoke to its professional welfare staff , largely ignored me			1
' despite several friends explaining on multiple occasions that his mere presence unnerved me , he seemed to devote his life to making me feel uncomfortable			0
on nights i was working behind the college bar , he would carefully place himself between me and the exit , sitting there all night			0
' one time when i left a party as soon as he came in he followed me all the way out of college			0
i ran , and made it halfway back to my house before stopping			0
whether his behaviour was intentional is irrelevant : i spent as little time in college as i could , rarely attending events there			0
' i have contacted the welfare officers about this , but they have largely ignored me except to say that if he ’s around i should just leave			0
i have a year left at @entity18 , as does he			1
i still do n’t understand why i should be the one leaving			0
' a spokesman for @entity1 said : ' sexual harassment and violence of any kind is unacceptable at @entity18			2
when such incidents do occur , our culture is one of strong support for victims , including guidance and advice on making complaints			0
' judge @entity23 's comments sparked outrage after suggesting that women should not get drunk in order to protect themselves from being raped			1
the @entity18 - educated judge said : ' it is an inevitable fact of it being one person 's word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict			1
' i will also say , and i will be pilloried for saying so , but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk			2
' in response to this ms @entity6 said : ' @entity23 is right in that rape conviction statistics are lower than they should be			1
however , the criminal justice system is to blame , not drunk women			0
' in @entity18 , only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction , according to the latest figures			1
the president of the @entity88 , @entity87 , 21 , was cleared of rape allegations in june this year and has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of similar claims			2
he was on bail for six weeks after being arrested over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another .			1
