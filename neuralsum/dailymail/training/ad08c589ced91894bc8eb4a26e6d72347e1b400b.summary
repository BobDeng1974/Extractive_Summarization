@entity0 is backing @entity1 to go on to break @entity4 ’s @entity3 caps record as he prepares to make his 100th appearance against @entity6 a week on saturday			1
the @entity8 striker will earn his golden cap in the @entity11 qualifier , taking him to just 25 appearances short of the mark set by the goalkeeper			1
at 29 , time could be against @entity1 but @entity0 is convinced @entity4 ’s record is set to fall			1
@entity3 captain @entity1 will win his 100th cap against @entity6 next week @entity1 could go on to become @entity3 's most capped player ever according to manager @entity0 the @entity8 striker made his debut in 2003 at the age of 17 , in a friendly against @entity22 the @entity3 manager said : ‘ i think he could ( do it )			1
we play on average 10 games a year and in two years ’ time he will be 30 or 31			2
that is no age for a player today			2
‘ i would say @entity4 ’s record is in danger			1
generally the record for caps it is always held by a goalkeeper so it will be some achievement if a forward can take the record			0
it would be a great achievement and i would back him to do it			0
’ @entity1 has scored 43 times for his country in the past 11 years since his debut the forward , @entity3 captain since last summer 's @entity40 , has played in the tournament three times @entity0 has handed @entity43 his first @entity3 call for a year and did not rule out giving the @entity46 winger some playing time as he returns from a serious knee injury			1
@entity49 has also been rewarded for his excellent form at @entity51 , with @entity52 absent with a calf injury			1
@entity0 ’s relationship with @entity56 manager @entity55 has drawn much scrutiny over the @entity59 ‘ fatigue ’ affair			1
@entity0 said : ‘ @entity61 was never a realistic possibility as he is still recovering from his calf injury he picked up , which is unfortunate			2
we were hoping of course to get him back but it has n’t worked out			0
@entity4 is currently @entity3 's record cap holder , having played 125 times for his country @entity4 's international career lasted 20 years , but @entity0 believes @entity1 can pass his cap record ' our medical staff have had contact and i left a message for @entity55			1
the message was pretty obvious that he is not fit			2
@entity55 has not rung back to counter that he actually is fit			1
’ asked when he left the message , @entity0 said : ‘ only last night i left a message , basically to tell him that when i name the squad that @entity52 is unfit			1
' there was no need to call me back , just to let him know that i understood @entity52 was n’t fit for this game so if i got any questions today the answers i give would be ones he understands and be happy with			1
’ @entity52 is close to a @entity56 return , but is still not fit enough to play for @entity3 yet @entity0 defended his decision to reveal that @entity59 missed an @entity3 game because he was tired on the back of the issues surrounding @entity59 ’s absence from the qualifier in @entity95 , @entity0 insisted his relationship with the forward is good			1
@entity0 said : ‘ i speak to @entity59 all the time			2
as far as i am concerned that chapter , which was an unfortunate one , is over			0
i have nothing to say or add			0
‘ we will both probably learn from it though i do n’t understand how it is mistake to tell the truth when asked why you have not chosen a player			2
’ @entity43 has joined the @entity3 squad with @entity110 ’s blessing			0
@entity0 did not rule out using him against @entity6 or @entity112 , though his role is likely to be limited to fitness work			1
@entity43 has returned to the @entity3 squad , despite only making one substitute appearance this season @entity43 has been out since january , when he injured his knee in an @entity118 tie against @entity119 @entity0 said : ‘ @entity43 over the past two and a half years has been important			1
he is continuing with a fitness plan that we will follow while he is with us			0
‘ we have given the club that guarantee and @entity123 is happy for us to take him			0
i spoke to @entity43 on wednesday and said how pleased i was			0
i ca n’t guarantee him minutes but that is no guarantee that he wo n’t get minutes			0
if he is feeling fit and we can use him we will			0
’ @entity0 also explained that @entity49 's inclusion , for the first time at senior level , was based on his form in the @entity130 and for @entity132 's under 21 side , and suggested the @entity51 striker will get game time			2
' the reasons are quite obvious , not only because he ’s done so well for his club but for the under 21s team too			0
@entity49 has earned his first senior call - up , on the back of excellent form for the @entity142 side @entity49 has also been in good goalscoring form for his club , scoring seven @entity130 goals ' he ’s been in good form and he has been in our mind since the last get - together			0
the under 21s only have a friendly so i saw no reason not to bring him in now			0
' there is no point bringing these players in if they do n’t have a chance to play			0
he will hope to but he faces competition from the other strikers too			0
