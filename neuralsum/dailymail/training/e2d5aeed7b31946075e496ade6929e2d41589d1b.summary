this is the nail - biting moment an eight - year - old elephant manages beat off a savage attack by 14 hungry lionesses			1
the near - three minute fight - captured on film by safari - goers in the @entity6 , @entity7 - shows the feisty herbivore surrounded by predators near a watering hole			1
as the lions viciously set about the tusked mammal - who was separated from its herd - they begin taking it in turns to leap on its back and sink their teeth into its body			2
' ' we were on safari as observers , witnessing a cycle of life that is , at times , very cruel , ' he added			2
in the video , @entity51 and other bystanders - including @entity66 art professor @entity65 , @entity68 naturalist @entity67 and @entity70 travel writer @entity69 - are heard encouraging the the elephant to ' go on fight back ! ' in a bid to shrug off its attackers , the quick - thinking elephant darts into the water			2
however , the lions do n't seem too fazed by the wet and several of them bound into the shallow depths			0
after a lengthy battle , the elephant beats the odds and escapes unscathed			1
it is seen triumphantly flapping its ears , trumpeting and splashing through the water			0
the gaggle of lions apparently left the scene and found a buffalo for dinner instead			0
the carcass was found ' picked clean to the bone ' the next day			0
the group who watched the fray from the safety of a jeep were mid-tour with the @entity100 company			0

lets all go swimming : with the watering hole in sight the elephant gains speed as the lionesses make a final attempt to ground it home stretch : a stubborn lionesses refuses to let go as the elephant reaches the waters edge , and the cats are faced with a tough decision water sports : a lioness clings on for dear life on the elephants back , as other members of the pride scurry back from the waters edge come on in the water 's fine : having seen off its attackers , the elephants turns and gives chase to the scaredy cats catch me if you can : the elephant , safe at last , takes a few steps into the watering hole , while the angry lionesses watch on the hunted becomes the hunter : refreshed and reinvigorated the elephant emerges from the water and chases one of the lionesses off			1
