by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:16 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 13:03 est , 26 november 2013 many @entity2 who were held hostage during the @entity5 revolution have spoken out against the nuclear deal recently brokered with @entity5 saying that it is a mistake to trust the controversial @entity9 regime			1
a number of the hostages , including @entity12 , see the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980 , when he and others languished , facing mock executions and other torments			2
' it 's kind of like @entity19 all over again , ' said mr @entity20 , now retired and living in @entity21 , @entity22 , after a career at the @entity24 and elsewhere			2
taken outside to display to the crowds : one of the @entity26 held hostage in the @entity28 in @entity29 was walked around the compounds on november 9 , 1979 , five days after the ordeal began chaotic : a majority of the hostages were held for 444 days and it was the end of diplomatic relations with @entity5 the hostage crisis began in november 1979 when militants stormed the @entity37 in @entity29 and seized its occupants			1
in all , 66 were taken hostage			2
thirteen were released less than three weeks later in 1979 ; one was released in july 1980 ; the remaining 52 were released january 20 , 1981			2
downfall : the @entity5 hostage crisis was cited as the lowest point of then - president @entity19 's term retired air force col. @entity44 , 83 , called the deal ' foolishness			1
' ' my personal view is , i never found an @entity5 leader i can trust , ' he said			2
' i do n't think today it 's any different from when i was there			0
none of them , i think , can be trusted			0
why make an agreement with people you ca n't trust ? ' @entity44 was a military attache in @entity5 who was among those held hostage			1
he now lives in @entity62 , @entity63 , with his wife of more than 60 years , @entity64 , who also takes a dim view of the agreement			0
‘ we are probably not very @entity68 - like when it comes to all this , ' she said			0
the weekend agreement between @entity5 and six world powers — the @entity2 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 — is to temporarily halt parts of @entity29 's disputed nuclear program and allow for more intrusive international monitoring of @entity5 's facilities			1
in exchange , @entity5 gains some modest relief from stiff economic sanctions and a pledge from @entity86 that no new penalties will be levied during the six months			2
to be sure , the former hostages have varying views			0
@entity90 , 72 , a retired diplomat from @entity91 , @entity92 , sees the pact as a positive first step			0
@entity90 , who was a political counselor at the embassy in @entity29 in 1979 , had written a diplomatic cable months before the hostage crisis warning about the difficulties of negotiation with the @entity5			1
a long memory : former hostage @entity44 , 83 , thinks that time has not changed the @entity5 leadership			1
' my personal view is , i never found an @entity5 leader i can trust , ' he said still , he said in a phone interview monday that it is possible to cut a mutually beneficial deal with them			1
' the challenge is @entity5 society and politics is so fragmented that it 's difficult to reach a consensus , ' he said — a problem that is also present in the @entity2 he said he considers the deal ' in a category of an initial confidence measure			1
' @entity119 , 70 , of @entity120 , who was a political officer held hostage during the crisis and later became deputy assistant secretary of state for @entity5 in 2009 and 2010 , also supports the deal			1
he said he does not view it in terms of whether @entity5 can be trusted , but whether the regime recognizes that a deal is in their own interest			1
' i would say there is a consensus among the leadership , and the consensus is , “ we like to stay in power			0
we like our palaces , ” ’ @entity119 said			0
‘ we 've seen the alternatives in @entity141 and @entity142 , ’ he argued , citing other areas where established regimes have been toppled			0
hopeful : @entity90 , 72 , a retired diplomat from @entity92 who was part of the group held for 444 days , sees the new nuclear pact as a positive first step he said it 's a mistake to be overly pessimistic about the prospects for a deal			1
' if we and the @entity5 could never agree , then @entity90 and @entity151 and all our colleagues would still be in @entity29 , ' he said			1
' the problem has been that our reality has been for the last 34 years that anything the other side proposed , you could never accept because by definition it had to be bad for us , because otherwise why would they propose it ? ' for other hostages , though , their experience has led them to the conclusion that attempting to negotiate and expecting @entity5 to live up to its end of the bargain is a losing proposition			1
sgt. @entity170 , 56 , of @entity171 , then a @entity173 sergeant , remembers clearly being told by his captors that their goal was to use the hostages to humiliate the @entity2 government , and he suspects this interim deal is in that vein			1
@entity20 , a former hostage , sees the negotiations now as no more effective than they were in 1979 and 1980 when he and others languished , facing mock executions and other torments ' it just hurts			2
we negotiated for 444 days and not one time did they agree to anything ... and here they beg for us to negotiate and we do , ' he said			0
' it 's hard to swallow			0
we negotiate with our enemies and stab our allies in the back			0
that does n't seem good			0
' the deal may also have a direct effect on some of the hostages who have long fought to sue the @entity5 government for damages			1
the new agreement calls for $ 4.2billion in frozen @entity5 assets to be released , which could make it more difficult to collect a judgment on any successful lawsuit			2
' and what do we get out of it ? ' asked @entity20			0
' a lie saying , “ we 're not going to make plutonium			0
” it 's a win - win for them and it 's a lose - lose for us			0

secretary of state @entity216 and other international politicians have struck a deal to temporarily suspend @entity5 's nuclear operation
the move brings back bad memories for the 66 @entity2 who were held hostage inside the @entity224 in @entity29 in 1979
@entity2 broke off diplomatic relations with @entity5 following the revolution but the frosty relationship is beginning to warm
