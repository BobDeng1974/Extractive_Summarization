by @entity1 reporter on the night before the operation begins to finally raise the @entity3 , haunting underwater footage shows the doomed cruise ship lying on the seabed which is littered with shoes , mattresses and deck chairs			1
the ship has been marooned and half - sunk off the coast of @entity12 for 20 months - a reminder of the tragedy which saw 32 people lose their lives on january 13 , 2012			1
tomorrow , the luxury liner will finally be lifted upright in the largest and most expensive maritime salvage operation in history			1
while dinner plates , cutlery , shoes and sun loungers lay scattered across the seabed for fish to swim around			0
the cost of lifting the giant cruise liner , which sank off the coast of @entity12 in january 2012 , off the sea bed , has ballooned to £ 500million - a figure that could rise if there are problems , organisers admitted			1
thirty - two people died when the ship , with 4,200 passengers onboard , hit rocks and ran aground off the island of @entity47 after an ill - judged ' salute ' to inhabitants by the ship ’s captain			1
the footage shows the former deck where passengers once sunbathed turned on its side the ship has been marooned and half - sunk off the coast of @entity12 for 20 months divers carry out a search of the shipwreck which lies off the coast of @entity12 divers have pumped 18,000 tonnes of cement into bags below the ship to support it and prevent it from breaking up still looking : divers swim around the @entity3 searching for two unaccounted people whose bodies were never found it will be rolled onto the platform in a manoeuvre known as parbuckling			1
workers will look for the bodies of two people , an @entity73 and an @entity74 unaccounted for since the disaster , as machines haul the 114,000 - tonne ship upright and underwater cameras comb the seabed			2

the salvage team will go through the ship cabin by cabin and hand over items found on board to the @entity73 state prosecutor , and the vessel will be towed away to be dismantled			2
the greatest fear for environmentalists is that the ship will break up under the massive force needed to haul it upright			0
uncharted territory : the international team of engineers will use a never - before attempted strategy to set upright the luxury liner huge task : the @entity3 cruise ship could be upright again next week , nearly two years after the liner capsized and killed at least 30 people tension : observers will hold their breath during the difficult and never - before - tried operation to salvage the @entity3 is attempted the @entity131 for the @entity132 have also highlighted the danger of pollution as thousands of tonnes of water inside the ship pours out			1
the ship ’s fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day , but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain			0
@entity146 , the @entity147 of @entity12 , said it ‘ will provide a sampling of the water in the affected area both during the rotation and in the days to follow , in order to identify the extent , the extension and duration of pollution			0
’ @entity157 : an aerial view shows the huge scale of @entity3 - equivalent to a floating city - set against the backdrop of the houses on @entity47 heaving work : an underwater platform has been built on which the 114,00 - tonne ship will come to rest as jacks and underwater cables haul it upright unprecedented : the cost of refloating the @entity3 has risen to £ 500million and has involved 500 engineers eventually , in a secondary operation , the cruise liner will be refloated and towed away to be broken up for scrap metal			1
four @entity3 crew members and a @entity177 company official were sentenced to jail in july for their part in the accident , and the ship 's captain @entity183 remains on trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship			0

' - became a catchphrase in @entity73 after the accident			0
a 500 - member salvage team from 24 nations will be conducting the operation to move the ship , known in nautical terms as parbuckling , before the autumn storm season arrives , when winds and powerful waves risk battering it to the point it wo n't hold together			2
dozens of crank - like pulleys will start slowly rotating the ship upright at a rate of about 3metres per hour			2
steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright			0
tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward			0
although parbuckling is a tested way to set upright capsized vessels , the operation has never been applied to a huge cruise liner .			2
