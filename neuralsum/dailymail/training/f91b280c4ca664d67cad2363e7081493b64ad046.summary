by @entity0 when @entity2 ’s @entity1 returned to tour life three months after surgery for a herniated disc , he lasted two tournaments and was n’t seen again until the following year			1
so the understandable exuberance that greeted the stunning announcement last friday of @entity10 ’s return from a similar operation , at his own tournament in @entity13 this week , needs to be tempered with a degree of caution			1
yes , it all looks promising for the 38 - year - old to be at @entity18 at @entity19 next month , where he won in such emotional circumstances in 2006 , his first victory following the death of father @entity24			1
but , as @entity1 discovered , there ’s a world of difference between the driving range and playing competitively			2
eyes on the prize : @entity10 tasted glory at @entity19 in 2006 @entity32 annouces return from injury trophy boy : @entity10 was victorious in @entity36 eight years ago taking soundings at the @entity38 two weeks ago from @entity40 reporters who spend their lives writing about @entity10 , the most optimistic projection for his return was the @entity44 , staged in august before the season ’s final major , the @entity45			1
one close to @entity10 ’ caddie , @entity47 , thought we would n’t see him again until @entity49 just goes to show that , five years after hydrant-gate , even a backstage pass at the @entity10 travelling circus still offers little insight into what really goes on in the life of the headline act			1
less than a month ago @entity10 said the recovery process following surgery in march was so slow he was n’t able to throw a ball with his kids yet			1
now he ’s teeing it up on the @entity61			0
is he rushing his return in the hope the entire summer will not prove a washout ? he certainly had good cause to compete at the @entity68 tournament this week , since the sponsor is one of the principal benefactors of the @entity72			1
@entity73 will give a press conference today in which he will explain his astonishing recovery			0
and then it will be fingers crossed for when he goes out to play			0
yes , @entity18 would go on merrily without him at @entity79			1
but what a huge shot in the arm it would be to see him back at the venue where , in 2006 , he gave perhaps the most brilliant example of course management we have seen in recent times			1
if ever an event summed up a sport ’s astonishing transformation , it was the women ’s @entity38 at @entity93 last week			2
women ’s golf was supposed to be beyond the @entity95 , dominated by players from the @entity97 high on quality but low on charisma			0
now its higher echelons are dominated by a quorum who look great and play even better			0
in the final round on sunday you had world no 1 @entity107 — who spent seven years of her life wearing a back brace to correct curvature of the spine — posting a 66 to set a target for the long - limbed beauty @entity114			1
young gun : @entity114 hugs the championship trophy ‘ i do n’t know what just happened			0
birdie the last seven holes ? even saying it sounds crazy			0
’ no wonder @entity40 @entity121 was in shock			0
trailing by seven shots , he one - putted each of his last 10 holes and birdied the last seven for a back nine of 28 to win the @entity126 in @entity127 by a shot from - it would have to be him , would n’t it ? - the luckless @entity132 and @entity134 ’s @entity133			1
how many times have we detailed @entity114 ’s struggles over the years to fulfil her unquestioned talent ? this time last year she was an object of ridicule for an outrageous putting style , with her back so parallel to the ground you could serve supper off it			2
no wonder the twitter - sphere exploded with joy when she shrugged off a double bogey at the 16th to birdie the 17th and win her first major at the age of 24 by two shots			2
on those upturned saucer greens , she did n’t have a three - putt all week			2
and then there was the lass in third place playing , would you believe , her first event as a pro. step forward 22 - year - old @entity161 from @entity162 in @entity163			1
rising star : @entity163 's @entity161 finished third at the 18th hole , she knocked in one more birdie putt from 15 feet to claim a cheque for £ 170,000 and earn her card for the @entity169 in one fell swoop			2
what price @entity163 having the world no 1 in men ’s and women ’s golf over the next couple of years ? and who ’s @entity161 going to play for in the @entity177 — that will be the next question			0
@entity180 is going to do fabulous things for women ’s golf and @entity183 and @entity163 , with the likes of @entity161 and @entity185 right at the forefront			0
the next stop for all these players is the @entity189 at @entity191 ’s best course , @entity192 , in a fortnight			0
let ’s hope the summer weather holds .			0
