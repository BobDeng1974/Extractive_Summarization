@entity2 ’s top 10 benefits claimants were paid on average more in handouts than someone earning over £ 85,000 , it can be revealed			1
average welfare payments to 10 families were worth on average more than £ 1,100 - a - week before a cap on payments was introduced			1
work and pensions secretary @entity10 said he was determined to end the ‘ ludicrous situation ’ where people on benefits had a higher income than the average wage of someone who goes out to work			1
latest figures show that between april 2013 and march 2014 , 42,252 households were affected by the benefit cap , which limits welfare payments to £ 500 - a - week the figures mean the 10 highest benefits claimants an average each week - higher than the gross weekly pay of dentists , accountants and teachers and almost as much as a senior police officer the benefits cap is set at £ 500 - a - week , or £ 26,000 - a - year - chosen by ministers because it is close to the average pre-tax wage of someone in work			1
the new figures relate to the amount households were able to claim before the cap was introduced			0
the largest sums are likely to have been driven by large claims for housing benefit			0
more than 42,000 households have seen their benefits cut since the cap came into force in april last year			0
until now the @entity44 had only said that 96 had been receiving more than £ 900 - a - week			2
@entity45 has refused to release details of each of the highest claimants to protect their identity			0
but now ministers have confirmed that the average payment amount the top 10 claimants had been capped by was £ 607			1
this means that on average they were receiving £ 1,107 - a - week , or £ 57,564 - a - year			1
work and pensions secretary @entity10 said the government was ending the ' ludicrous situation ' of people on benefits receiving more than average workers ' incomes the benefits cap covers @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity66 other payments included are @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , most @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			0
with the data only providing the average for the top 10 , the figure for the highest recipients is likely to be much higher			2
someone on an annual salary of £ 85,000 would have take - home pay of only £ 56,444			0
according to the @entity84 , a dentist 's pre-tax pay is £ 972 - a - week , a chartered accountant £ 716.90 and a secondary school teacher £ 644.10			1
mr @entity10 told @entity87 : ‘ the benefit cap has addressed the ludicrous situation we were in where people were receiving far more in benefits than the ordinary hardworking family earns			1
‘ it is not right that before we introduced it some families could rake in more than double the amount that the average taxpayer takes home			0
‘ by limiting the amount any household can receive to £ 26,000 a year we are restoring fairness to the system			2
‘ our reforms are helping people move off benefits and into work , and already we have seen that more than 100 people affected by the benefit cap have moved into work every week on average since its introduction			0
’ the benefit cap is set at £ 500 a week for couples , with or without children , and single parents			2
an adult living alone is limited to £ 350 - a - week			0
latest figures show that between april 2013 and march 2014 , 20,088 families received between £ 500 and £ 550 in benefits , meaning they lost £ 50 under the cap			2
a further 11,583 were capped after receiving £ 550 - £ 600 and 5,311 were given £ 600 - £ 650			0
overall 96 received £ 900 - a - week or more , equivalent to £ 46,800 - a - year			1
earlier this year , @entity87 submitted a freedom of information request asking for the top 10 households by the amount they have been capped by per week , giving the amount each had been capped by and the region they live in			2
the figures show that most families hit by the benefits cap live in @entity133 and the @entity134 but the @entity44 refused , insisting it is a ‘ criminal offence to release @entity140 information relating to an individual without lawful authority to do so ’ , even though the request had not asked for the names of the people affected			0
since then @entity144 mp @entity143 asked a parliamentary question for the ‘ highest amount is that a single household has been capped as a result of the benefit cap ’			0
employment minister @entity150 replied : ‘ of the top 10 highest capped households at the end of march 2014 , the average capped amount was £ 607 per week			1

benefits cap set at average pay of £ 500 - a - week or £ 26,000 - a - year
