by @entity0 published : 20:02 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 06:39 est , 1 may 2013 primary children are being told to take a safety test before riding their scooters to school			1
pupils who pass are issued with a permit they are told can be withdrawn if they are spotted causing a nuisance on the pavements			2
the scheme was introduced at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , where headmaster @entity13 said police community support officers would explain the rules			1
in training : pupils at a @entity12 school will have to pass a safety test if they want to use their scooter to get to school ( file photo ) a letter from headteacher @entity13 appeared to say @entity24 who attended the course would take licences away from trouble - makes			1
the plan infuriated parents who declared the plan was ‘ ridiculous ’ and ‘ unworkable ’ - but , after some confusion , @entity32 yesterday insisted officers would ‘ only offer safety advice ’			1
mr @entity13 first wrote to parents in november saying concerns had been raised with the school			1
‘ we have had a number of calls from local residents , some complaining about pupils from our school scooting in and around cars in cul - de - sacs near to the school and others concerned over the safety of our pupils , ’ he said			2
‘ these latter calls have commented both on some pupils [ sic ] lack of road sense and the busy - ness of the roads in the local area			0
’ although he ordered parents to stop their children taking scooters to school , he revealed he had been in contact with @entity63 about setting up a safe - riding programme			1
elf and safety : parents at @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12 branded the plan to introduce scooter permits ¿ ridiculous ¿ and ¿ unworkable ¿ in a follow - up letter last month , he said the first session had gone ahead with ‘ a large number of children from each year group ’			1
a teacher and two @entity24 had been in charge and permits were being issued to pupils who passed			2
he added : ‘ we have made it clear to the children that if they are seen to be scooting unsafely on the way to or from school their permit will be withdraw immediately ( the @entity24 have agreed to support us in this too , as well as recognising those who continue to scoot responsibly and safely )			1
’ one mother said yesterday : ‘ you hear all this stuff about the nanny state but i never expected this			0
‘ we ’re talking about children on scooters - not teenagers on motorbikes			2
they ’ll be terrified if they ’re pulled over [ by an officer ] for being too enthusiastic on their scooters			0
’ another parent said : ‘ this is totally unworkable			0
if i ’m happy for my son to use a scooter to school then no one can stop me			0
’ but one father commented : ‘ i think it is a great idea that kids are being taught road sense			0
there are courses for kids on bicycles and this is the same sort of thing			0
’ @entity32 were unaware of the agreement between the school and @entity24 when contacted and were unable to contact the officers			1
the force later issued a statement which said : ‘ @entity32 welcome and support the idea of scooter permits as a way to keep children safe when travelling to and from school			2
‘ however , the introduction of scooter permits is a school initiative and officers are there to offer safety advice and not enforcement			0
’ the school has around 750 boys and girls aged eight to 12 and was rated outstanding by @entity137 in 2011			0
it failed to respond yesterday to a request for information about how many complaints had been received , whether any children - or pedestrians - had been injured and if the @entity24 had offered to enforce the rules			1
a @entity146 spokesman said : ‘ this is something for the school rather than the local education authority			0

children at @entity12 primary need permit to scoot to school
@entity24 will explain rules at @entity10 in @entity11
parents at the school call plan ' ridiculous ' and ' unworkable '
