20 years after he last hosted his own program , the broadcaster dubbed ' @entity0 ' will front a current affairs show on pay - tv channel @entity4			1
and it 'll be the tried and tested no - holds - barred @entity0 approach , which has served him well over the years			1
. and also landed him in hot water			0
' it feels pretty good , i do enjoy the stuff i do at the moment but to have your own program again , it has been 20 years since the @entity16 program , ' he told @entity17 on wednesday			1
@entity0 will become a host of his own current affairs show again , @entity0 live on @entity4 , some 20 years after his last program was shelved by @entity23 @entity0 's recent career has been dominated by radio and appearances on the @entity28 program on @entity29 , while also filling in on @entity4 for other presenters @entity0 is the first to admit he 's made plenty of his own headlines , aside from reporting on those in them			1
he has battled liver cancer , was given little hope by doctors but underwent a transplant three years ago			1
he reportedly found love again at age 70 , with with former detective @entity40 , 36 years his junior			2
but it is his professional career which has been colourful and controversial , to the extreme			0
in 1987 , he served a short time in jail for revealing details of an alleged paedophile priest 's prior conviction during a trial			2
he was then placed under house arrest for five weeks in 2011 for breaching suppression orders on the names of sex offenders , as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘ a right to know ’ who they are			0
and he was forced to spend his birthday last year behind bars in @entity63 's @entity62			0
the shock jock jailed for 50 days for failing to pay a court fine of $ 100,000 imposed on him for breaching another suppression order , this time relating to @entity69 's killer			1
the veteran broadcaster has been jailed twice and placed under house arrest on another occasion for breaking contempt of court and breaking suppression orders @entity0 has always argued for the public 's right to know			2
here the broadcaster held a news conference outside the @entity78 in @entity79 in july last year after meeting with @entity81 's attorney - general to discuss his proposal to introduce a @entity84 - style sex offender register but he has n't changed and wo n't be changing , @entity0 promised			1
' it will be a fair bit of the old @entity87 ( style ) and a touch of @entity90 in there too with a lot more interviews and a bit of entertainment , ' he said			0
' remember that i hosted the @entity97 , did a lot of showbiz and spoke with a lot of authors , getting a guest on the set on a saturday night will be interesting			1
' they ( @entity4 ) approached me , i was n’t out there shopping for a job			2
' two shows on a weekend will be a challenge , we all know that saturday night is a wasteland on tv but that is the challenge for me			1
' saturday night , especially , will be hard core , plenty of people have said to me " oh , it will be great i have nothing to watch on saturday night " so we ’ll see what happens			1
' it wo n't be as political as the other stuff on @entity4 , which is so politically skewed with panellists , i am just putting it together , a work in progress and i have already been bumped from the planned opening program because of the @entity81 election			1
' anyone thinking he may be getting soft in his slightly advanced age , would be sadly mistaken			0
' just because it ’s the weekend i 'm not going to be suddenly become the homogenised version of @entity0 , ' he said			1
' i got into trouble recently when i was filling in when i said that @entity131 walks as if as it he 's got @entity133 - i speak my mind and i am too old to change and not interested in changing			2
' there wo n't be this makeover thing , it 's just me			1
' i 've got a new venue , they ( @entity4 ) are very committed , i 'm in a brand new studio at @entity141			2
' it 's @entity143 based but not @entity143 - centric			0
' he says the hunger for news and current affairs is still there , 55 years after beginning as a cadet on the @entity151 in @entity152			1
the other challenge will be to get the big names to open up and find up and comers to interview			0
' two shows on a weekend will be a challenge , we all know that saturday night is a wasteland on tv but that is the challenge for me , ' @entity0 admitted ' when you ’ve been around a long time , it 's a big advantage , you have a sense of history , ' he told @entity17			1
' @entity169 , for example , i remember raising it with @entity171 before ( @entity173 ) @entity172 brought it in and i told @entity175 that i supported it and he said " you 're f * * * ing mad " and went on to tell me why and he was righ about some other taxes and all the promises that were n’t kept			0
' it 's those sorts of anecdotes and experiences i can draw on			0
' they ( interesting characters ) are still out there , i must say , and i do admit the better stoushes did come with the older pollies like @entity188 and @entity189			0
' @entity191 would revoke your insults sarcastically , delivering a @entity194 or a @entity195 in his response , ' he said , delivering an almost perfect @entity188 impersonation in making the point			0
' but @entity189 , was so smart , he was actually charismatic			0
women would flock to @entity189 when he walked into a room , he was n't all just @entity202 suits			0
' politics will not be the dominant subject , for fear of turning viewers off on the tricky saturday night programming			1
' i wo n't be heavily political and when we can , it will be about the week that was as well , it ’s a work in progress			2
' @entity17 found him in quite jovial mood and when asked who he would like to line up as guests for the early shows , @entity0 quipped : ' @entity217 on the first show and the @entity219 on the second			2
@entity0 says he 's always ready to go toe - to - toe with the biggest names			2
' they ( interesting characters ) are still out there			0
@entity188 would revoke your insults sarcastically , delivering a @entity194 or a @entity195 in his response but @entity189 was so smart , he was actually charismatic			0
women would flock to @entity189 when he walked into a room , he was n't all just @entity202 suits			0
