he was viewed as @entity2 ’s finest general , admired even by the @entity3 for his skills as a military leader			0
but to one captured @entity8 soldier , @entity6 was the man who saved his life – and gave him beer and cigarettes			1
captain @entity12 , from the @entity13 , has told how he was introduced to the ‘ @entity14 ’ after being taken prisoner in @entity16			1
without uniform or identification due to the secrecy of the operation , he was treated as a spy and told he would be shot			0
but @entity6 requested a meeting with the new prisoner and asked the @entity35 if there was anything he needed			1
captain @entity12 said he replied : ‘ a good meal , a pint of beer and a packet of cigarettes			1
’ to his astonishment he was then ushered into @entity6 ’s mess , where all three items were waiting for him			1
capt @entity12 , now 95 , saved the empty cigarette packet as a souvenir and will recount his adventure on sunday ’s edition of @entity51			1
he said : ‘ i was told that @entity6 always wanted to meet men who had been doing something unusual when they were captured			1
‘ i was meant to have been shot			0
i was told on several occasions during my interrogation that is what would happen unless i talked			0
‘ @entity2 had issued orders that commandos were to be shot but @entity6 declined to obey that instruction			2
he was a very fine @entity62 and a clean fighter			2
’ memento : now 95 , the former @entity13 soldier has kept the empty cigarette packet he was given ripe old age : the veteran is now 95 after working as the principal of @entity68 as well as the cigarette packet , capt @entity12 ’s @entity70 and a photo of him being presented with a ribbon to his mc by @entity8 army chief @entity6 @entity73 will also be on display on the show			1
he is told by the programme ’s experts that his collection is worth as much as £ 10,000 – but to applause from onlookers , he responds : ‘ not for sale			0
’ capt @entity12 was awarded the @entity70 for a death - defying mission to clear a path through a minefield in @entity85 while under mortar fire , and the bar for his role in @entity89 , the mission that led to his capture			1
then and now : capt @entity12 ( left ) will be telling his story to the @entity92 's @entity51 on sunday history : captain @entity12 receiving his @entity70 ribbon ' somewhere in the @entity96 ' long life : @entity12 and his late wife @entity98 on their wedding day in may 1944			1
he was on his honeymoon when he was called up for the secret mission			0
he has lived a long and happy life , unlike @entity6 he was feared and respected by @entity8 's wartime generals , but field marshal @entity6 was not universally loved by the @entity105			2
he was caught unawares by the d - day landings because he was on his way to ask @entity2 for permission to rearrange troops in @entity16			0
@entity6 had to make an urgent return in a failed bid to stop the @entity114 advance - but he fell out of favour with the @entity20 high command			1
his apparent disobedience of orders to kill @entity114 spies would not have helped and according to his son @entity120 , in the summer of 1944 the general wanted to surrender as he faced increased @entity114 troops			2
@entity2 was having none of it - as he wanted to take the @entity62 people with him to the grave			1
finally @entity6 was forced to take his own life after being implicated in a failed plot to kill the @entity20 leader			2
the general took cyanide so his family would be spared in october 1944 , just four months after the d - day landings			1
the true reasons behind his death were covered up until just a few years ago , when a report emerged by a doctor who confessed he had falsified the death certificate - to say @entity6 died of a heart attack			1
the operation took place during a remarkable two weeks in which he got married , met the @entity143 to receive his mc , was captured and encountered @entity6			1
capt @entity12 , from @entity144 , @entity145 , said : ‘ i was on my honeymoon in @entity147 and … there was a telegram asking me to report to my unit immediately and that mrs @entity151 was not to travel with me			1
reconnaissance photos had spotted these obstacles just below the waterline and they could n’t determine from the pictures what they were			0
' they suspected they were some form of mine			0
’ capt @entity12 joined a group of four to carry out a series of covert night - time inspections – but on the last mission , they were seen by a @entity62 boat and captured			1
he recalled : ‘ we were taken to a house and interrogated for two weeks			0
they wanted to know what we had been doing but i did n’t say anything			0
' after that i was taken to a chateau and given a cup of tea and some cake			0
i was told to have a wash and smarten up because i was going to see someone very important			0
‘ i was marched into a room and there behind a desk was @entity6			2
i recognised him immediately because i had studied photographs of him while in the @entity96			0
’ he continued : ‘ @entity6 asked me what i was doing in @entity16 but i did n’t say anything			2
he then asked me if there was anything i required			0
' i just said i could do with a pint of beer , a packet of cigarettes and a good meal			0
' i was taken to his mess and served by his waiter and on the table was a stein [ mug ] of beer , cigarettes and a plate of food			2
i could n’t understand it			0
’ capt @entity12 was taken to a pow camp in northern @entity62 where he remained for the rest of the war			1
he went on to become principal of @entity68			0
his wife @entity98 died 25 years ago , and he has two sons and three grandchildren			0
@entity6 was forced to commit suicide in 1944 after being implicated in a plot to kill @entity2			1
he took his own life after assurances by the @entity105 that if he did so , his family would be unharmed			0
belongings : capt @entity12 's precious military memorabilia , including his treasured @entity70			2
