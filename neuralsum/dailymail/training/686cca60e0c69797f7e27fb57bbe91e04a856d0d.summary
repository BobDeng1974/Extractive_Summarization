another go : the pair targeted cars in traffic or traffic lights and filmed from the distance to gauge the reaction joke : this woman saw the funny side and told him not to worry after he got into her car chat : this female driver also laughed at @entity8 and then told him ' you frightened me to death ' calm : this driver say @entity8 in the passenger seat and politely asked him to leave ' i showed my mom and she howled with laughter , which she always does because she loves the videos i post on youtube			2
