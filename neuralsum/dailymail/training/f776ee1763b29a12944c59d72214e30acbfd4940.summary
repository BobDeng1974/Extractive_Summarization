by @entity0 last updated at 6:36 pm on 23rd november 2011 ' amazing ' : a new study will give hope to thousands of people with @entity4 's after halting brain shrinkage in the region linked to memory @entity4 ’s could be eased by bursts of electricity to the brain , research suggests			1
in a small - scale study , regular fleeting pulses of electricity stopped the brain shrinkage linked to the memory - robbing disease			1
the bursts of energy also appeared to prevent key brain regions from ‘ shutting down ’ , this week ’s @entity18 reports			1
the research is very preliminary , with just six patients treated , but the results have been described as ‘ amazing ’			2
@entity4 's and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 @entity27 , and the number is expected to double in a generation as the population ages			0
current drugs can halt the progression of the disease , but do not work for everyone and their effects wear off over time , leaving the disease free to take its cruel course			0
to try to halt and even reverse the brain wasting effects , the @entity39 researchers turned to a technique called deep - brain stimulation			1
this involves implanting electrodes deep within the brain and programming them to give off tiny pulses of electricity 130 times a second			1
while this may seem radical , it is already successfully used to ease the tremors , stiffness and walking problems of @entity55			2
in @entity4 ’s , the hippocampus , the brains ’ memory hub , shrinks			0
in addition , brain scans show that the temporal lobe , the region which contains the hippocampus , and another region called the posterior cingulate , use less sugar than normal , suggesting they have slowed or shut down			2
requires surgery : an x-ray showing implanted deep - brain stimulation electrodes like the ones used by researchers in @entity39 ( file picture ) to shock brain cells that carry signals to and from the hippocampus to try to combat this , the @entity39 researchers inserted electrodes into the brains of six patients , each of whom had been diagnosed with the disease at least a year earlier			1
during the brain surgery , the electrodes were carefully placed next to a bundle of brain cells that carry signals to and from the hippocampus			2
the electrodes released 130 bursts of electricity a second and , after a year , the brain ’s use of sugar had returned to normal in all six patients			1
and while the brain ’s memory hub shrunk in four of those taking part , it grew in the remaining two , a neuroscience conference heard last week			0
describing the result as ‘ amazing ’ , researcher @entity99 said : ‘ not only did the hippocampus not shrink , it got bigger – by 5 per cent in one person and 8 per cent in the other			0
progressive : a scan showing a healthy brain ( top ) compared with one displaying warning signs of @entity4 's ( bottom ) in red tests showed that their minds also seemed to be sharper than expected			0
dr @entity99 is n’t sure how the treatment works , but it may be through the electrical current driving the birth of new brain cells			0
and , in mice , deep brain stimulation triggers the production of proteins that encourage brain cells to form new connections			1
dr @entity99 , of @entity122 , is starting a bigger trial involving 50 people			0
answering criticism about the practicalities of using brain surgery to treat a common disease , he pointed out that deep brain stimulation has already been used 90,000 times in @entity55 ’s patients from around the world			1
he told @entity18 that @entity4 ’s is just five times more common than @entity55 ’s			0
and added : ‘ if it can be used in @entity55 ’s , it can be used in @entity4 ’s			0

region linked to memory stopped shrinking in small study
tests also appeared to prevent other areas from ' shutting down '
electrodes placed deep in brain released 130 pulses a second
same technique used to successfully treat *symptoms* of @entity55
researchers in @entity39 described results as ' amazing '
