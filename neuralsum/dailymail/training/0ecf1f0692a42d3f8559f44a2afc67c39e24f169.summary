they say you should let the train take the strain			0
and that ’s exactly what the @entity5 did today as she left @entity7 for her annual festive break at @entity9			1
but being the monarch , however , she also let her @entity11 do the work too			2
much to the surprise of fellow passengers on the 10.44 from @entity7 ’s @entity15 to @entity16 , the @entity5 and her husband , prince @entity17 , were driven all the way up platform 1 , right to the door of her first class carriage			1
commuters were kept behind ticket barriers without explanation , and only realise their train was being graced by royalty when they saw their official car purr past			2
@entity28 ! the @entity5 arrives at @entity30 station accompanied by the @entity17 smart in a knee - length @entity34 check coat and a printed silk headscarf , the @entity5 appeared in good spirits as she marched briskly towards the waiting carriage			1
the @entity17 , meanwhile , was dapper in a neat navy blue blazer , complete with polished brass buttons , and carried a walnut leather briefcase			0
the couple arrived at @entity16 on time at 12.21pm and smiled at well - wishers			2
the @entity5 ’s staff normally book their tickets in advance using her senior railcard , which this year would have cost £ 34.30 each			0
a source told the @entity50 : ‘ @entity5 encourages all her staff to buy tickets in advance as it works out so much cheaper and would always use a rail card if appropriate to do so			0
’ surprise ! commuters were staggered to see the monarch being driven up the platform to board the train on time : perhaps wary of missing the train , the royal couple then sped into one of the first class carriages @entity65 at @entity9 has become a royal tradition over the last century , with queen @entity67 becoming the first monarch to spend december 25th in residence			1
all of the senior royals , including @entity72 and the @entity17 and @entity73 , are expected to arrive at the private home within the next few days			0
prince @entity75 and the @entity76 are expected to arrive on christmas eve , just in time for tea and present opening at four			0
the 20,000 acre estate will also play host to the newly - christened @entity81 's first @entity65 and will be the first time that four monarchs , present and future , have holidayed together since the @entity86 period			1
@entity81 is expected to make his third public appearance during the @entity65 period , when he and his parents join the rest of the @entity92 for the traditional @entity65 service at the local parish church of @entity95			1
the @entity96 will also watch the @entity98 message together , although traditionally , the monarch retires to another room to see it			0
festivities will be rounded off with a shoot on @entity104 - another @entity105 tradition that dates back to the 19th century			0
family : @entity81 will spend his first @entity65 at @entity9 surrounded by the @entity92 tradition : the @entity5 and the senior royals spend each @entity65 at the @entity9 in @entity110			1
