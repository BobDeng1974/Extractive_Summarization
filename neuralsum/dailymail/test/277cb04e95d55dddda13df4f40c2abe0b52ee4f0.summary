tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults , according to a study of infants ’ brains which overturns the medical consensus			1
until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain			1
it means that newborns often go without painkillers , even during invasive procedures			0
but the new findings , revealed by @entity17 doctors , suggest that not only do babies feel pain , but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults			1
it overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold ( file picture ) in the first study of its kind , the researchers showed in brain scans that infants ’ brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain			1
dr @entity42 , of @entity17 ’s department of @entity44 , said : ‘ obviously babies ca n’t tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations			1
‘ in fact some people have argued that babies ’ brains are not developed enough for them to really “ feel ” pain , any reaction being just a reflex – our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case			1
’ the results , published in the journal @entity64 , suggest that it is possible to see pain ‘ happening ’ inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults			2
up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving , but otherwise were given no pain medication			2
a landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions , and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations			2
but injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief , and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child ’s pain			0
even this year , @entity92 guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than ‘ a cuddle ’			0
guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue - tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant ’s tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed			0
the research , which was carried out by doctors from @entity17 ( pictured ) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers , even for invasive procedures the @entity92 guidelines , updated in january 2015 , advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth ’s floor , infants do not need medication			1
older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic , doctors are told			2
but the guidelines say : ‘ in small babies , being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers			0
’ dr @entity42 called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated			0
‘ thousands of babies across the @entity130 undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians , ’ she said			2
‘ our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults			1
‘ we have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure			0
’ her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old , and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years			0
mri scans were taken of the babies ’ brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil – mild enough that it did not wake them up			0
the researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults ’ brains also ‘ lit up ’ in babies ’ brains			1
scans also showed that babies ’ brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower			1
dr @entity42 said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies			0
there are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream , with unknown consequences			0
‘ finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required , ’ she said .			2

young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults , according to study
doctors *previously* assumed very young babies had high pain threshold
new findings by @entity17 shows newborn babies do react to pain
