by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 09:02 est , 6 august 2012 an anti-circumcision group is holding a string of vociferous street protests in @entity4 to try and get the controversial procedure outlawed			1
the @entity6 claims to be the country 's ' feistiest ' pro-foreskin advocacy group			1
on its website it states its aim as being to give the human right of all children — male , female and intersex — to ' grow up with intact genitals '			0
over the weekend demonstrations were staged across the city of @entity20 in @entity22 @entity21 as campaigners stepped up their efforts to change the law			1
vocal protests took place outside a circumcision clinic and beside the @entity30 and on saturday night , there was an educational seminar extolling the virtues of foreskin			2
passionate : @entity34 speaks at a rally for the @entity4 @entity6			0
he tells supporters : ' i 'm here today because i love my foreskin			0
why do i love my foreskin ? because it is the most enjoyable part of my entire body ' in a video of one of the rally 's group leader @entity34 tells placard - waving supporters : ' i 'm here today because i love my foreskin			2
why do i love my foreskin ? because it is the most enjoyable part of my entire body			0
later in an interview mr @entity34 added : ' what our group is trying to do is extend the rights that girls already have - to be protected against any mutilation until they are 18 to boys and intersex kids			0
' the protests coincided with @entity20 ’s pride parade , and on sunday a pants - optional @entity60 contingent marched in the main parade			1
the events finished with a demonstration at @entity65 of which kind of fruit can be picked up with an uncircumcised penis - the answer being grapes			0
issue : a court in @entity73 , @entity74 , took the decision to outlaw circumcision on young boys however , the banning of circumcision has its detractors @entity20 surgeon dr @entity81 - whose clinic was targeted by protestors - specialises in the procedure says he advocates it on medical grounds			1
he says circumcision reduces the risks of urinary tract and penile infections and the risk of some sexually transmitted diseases and penile cancer			0
the issue has received significant publicity over recent months after a court in @entity73 , @entity74 , took the decision to outlaw circumcision on young boys because it can cause ' illegal bodily harm '			1
the step triggered an angry backlash among both @entity103 and @entity104 groups in the country which both advocate the procedure , a ritual in both religions			1
notably the @entity109 , a body politicians and the judiciary try to placate as often as possible given the history of the @entity113 was enraged by the decision			0
although only a local ruling , it may set a legal precedent that courts in the other 15 states of @entity74 would be obliged to follow			1
therefore the fight to reverse it could , ultimately , lead all the way to the @entity122 , @entity74 's highest			1
however , while many mainstream @entity74 citizens are in agreement with the court ruling and believe it should be halted			2
one survey last year showed 60 percent of @entity74 equating circumcision with genital mutilation			2
controversial : a mohel , left , prepares to carry out a circumcision on a baby boy as prayers are read during a traditional @entity103 ceremony ( file picture ) @entity136 , president of the @entity109 , said the verdict was ' an unprecedented and dramatic intervention in religious communities ' right to self - determination			2
last month the issue of circumcision hit the headlines in @entity145 after an extreme @entity103 circumcision practice in which the blood of a baby 's cut penis is sucked by a religious leader was been condemned after the deaths of two infants			1
the ' metzitzah b'peh ' performed by @entity153 sees the eight - day old baby have a traditional circumcision but the ' mohel ' then places his mouth around the wound and sucks up the blood			0
but the practice - intended to prevent infection - has sparked controversy in recent years after the death of two infants and the contraction of herpes in at least 11 others between november 2000 and december 2011			0
heath chiefs in @entity145 are now pushing through regulation forcing anybody wishing to have the procedure carried out on their babies to sign a consent waiver			2
but some @entity174 have complained about the measures claiming that they infringe on their ' religious freedom ' .			0

string of protests taking over weekend in @entity20
@entity181 claim to be country 's feistiest pro-foreskin advocacy group
demos follow @entity74 court decision to ban circumcision
also extreme @entity103 circumcision ritual in @entity145 triggered angry *reaction* recently
