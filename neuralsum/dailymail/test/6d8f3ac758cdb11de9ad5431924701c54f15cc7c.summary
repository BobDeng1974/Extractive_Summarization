moors murderer @entity0 has revealed he is a @entity2 supporter and thinks @entity3 is an ' establishment dumpling '			1
the 77 - year - old wrote the letters from his bed at @entity9 psychiatric hospital in @entity10			1
@entity11 was jailed for life in 1966 after torturing and killing five children with his then - girlfriend @entity14			2
instead he complained he is ' bedridden and worsening ' after breaking his hip and arm in fall a year ago			2
@entity11 ( left ) was jailed for life in 1966 after torturing and killing five children with his then - girlfriend @entity14 ( right ) the victims were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured then buried on @entity37 above @entity38			1
above , police search the area for the bodies in the december letter he wrote : ' this cell block is described as a " discharge ward " ; i 've been sitting here 30 years ... and there 's no turnaround of inmates unless in a coffin			1
' @entity11 murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 along with accomplice @entity14 , who died aged 60 in 2002			2
the victims were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured then buried on @entity37 above @entity38			1
@entity52 , 16 , disappeared on her way to a disco on july 12 , 1963 , and @entity55 , 12 , was snatched in november the same year			2
@entity56 was taken on june 16 , 1964 , after he left home to visit his grandmother			0
@entity59 , 10 , was lured away from a funfair on @entity61 , 1964 , and @entity0 , 17 , was killed in october 1965			0
his letter reads : politicians of today ? compared to the only truly democratic and altruistic peoples ’ government ever elected , @entity66 1945 , the @entity64 corrupt , greedmotivated ( sic ) political vermin of today , are n’t worth even assassination , all being @entity73 clerks / lackeys			1
however , i hope that @entity2 not only wipes out the @entity75 but also decimates the @entity73 and @entity66 vote , and that the @entity77 achieves the same in @entity79			1
in addition , i hope the @entity81 is reactivated , as promised for a united @entity82			0
[ ... ] the corporate controlled ( including the @entity84 ) lower middle class , collusive , servile media generate a false appearance if of democracy and free speech , in a now spineless population constantly asking , " am i allowed to say ( this and that ) ? " ( sic ) where the voters now have the choice between a coalition of public school millionaires or a refugee privileged @entity99 jew			1
absurdity ! incidentally , the @entity79 dictionary definition of " @entity103 " ( sic ) is , aptly , " a course grey bloodsucking horsefly "			0
@entity103 ( sic ) , like his @entity107 lickspittle @entity109 , would form a coalition with literally anyone , just to retain his public image of secondhand power and pathetic grandiosity			0
as i stopped reading @entity64 newspapers or relying on @entity64 media , depending only on @entity118 ( sic ) and @entity119 , i know nothing of any @entity122 decisions on @entity64 prisoners possibly voting , and could n’t care less ! ironically in my half century of imprisonment , i discovered that most professional criminals are @entity73 voters ! [ ... ] yours faithfully , @entity11 @entity56 ( left ) , 12 , was snatched and murdered in 1964 and @entity55 ( right ) , also 12 , was snatched in november the year before since being convicted @entity11 has hardly been seen			1
above , a police convoy takes @entity11 to @entity127 in 2000 for what was his first appearance in more than 30 years @entity11 was given whole life sentences for the murders of @entity55 , @entity59 and @entity0 - but did not admit to killing @entity56 and @entity132 until he was in prison			0
@entity56 's body has never been discovered			0
@entity14 was convicted of killing @entity59 and @entity0 , and shielding @entity11 after @entity55 's murder			2
she was jailed for life			0
taxpayers have forked out more than £ 14million on @entity11 since he was convicted nearly 50 years ago			0
he has racked up the costs by staging a 15 - year hunger strike and a series of failed legal challenges - for which he has relied on legal aid			1
he lost his last appeal to be transferred to a ' ordinary ' prison in june 2013 .			0

77 - year - old wrote letters from his bed at @entity9 in @entity10
hopes @entity2 will ' decimate ' the other political **parties** in general election
*branded* @entity3 an ' establishment dumpling ' in the rant
murdered five children in 1960s and buried bodies on @entity37
he hopes that @entity2 will ' decimate ' the other political **parties** in the general election , describing @entity163 's views as ' the usual mob - *pleasing* pr drivel expected from such *bovines* ' .
the political *leaders* are unworthy of ' even being assassinated ' .
voters must choose between ' public school millionaires ' or a ' refugee , privileged @entity99 jew ' - an offensive and *inaccurate* *reference* to @entity176 , whose @entity178 father fled the @entity179 .
after ' half - a - century ’s imprisonment ' , he believes most professional criminals are @entity73 voters . he also scoffs at the @entity185 ’s ' *disgust* ' over the *possibility* of convicted killers getting the vote by saying he ' could n’t care less about voting ' .
@entity192 ' for the dumb ' with the ' same old party hacks ' and labelled host @entity3 an ' establishment dumpling ' .
claims he does not like the @entity84 and stopped reading newspapers in 1998 - instead getting his *information* from @entity200 .
