with a perfect copy of the @entity6 film poster emblazoned across her back , portraits of @entity1 on both ribs and the @entity1 crest splashed across her breastbone , describing @entity11 , 52 , as a twilight fan is a bit of an understatement			1
but there 's more to the @entity17 's tattoos than a penchant for @entity19 , although the self - confessed member of @entity1 admits that it does play a part			1
for @entity11 , her etchings are also an important reminder of how far she 's come since christmas 2009 , when she weighed six stone more and was an unhappy size 24 - and a reward			1
@entity17 : 52 - year - old @entity11 has spent just under £ 8,500 on inkings that depict characters from @entity30 commitment : @entity11 's first tattoo was this full - back poster of the @entity35 film yet trading comfort eating for @entity30 tattoos has n't come cheap , as she happily admits			1
so far , she has spent just under £ 8,500 on getting inked but expects to have spent £ 25,000 by the time her ' body suit ' is complete			1
' i 've had about 91 hours of tattooing now and it 's costing a small fortune , ' explains @entity11 , who works as a baker for the @entity46 supermarket chain in her hometown of @entity48			1
' i 've forked out just under £ 8,500 and by the time i 'm finished , when [ my ] body 's completely covered , we 're looking at between £ 17,000 and £ 25,000			1
' @entity11 's passion for ink began after a friend handed her a copy of the first twilight book at the end of 2009			1
hooked , she quickly devoured the first novel and sped through the remaining three before buying the dvds and soundtracks of the accompanying films			2
her first tattoo , an elaborate recreation of the film poster for @entity35 , followed with more etchings added two weeks later			2
' we 've got the book covers , we 've got the ribbon , we 've got the family crest , we 've got the hairpiece , we 've got the chessboard from breaking @entity72 , we 've got the wolf tribal symbol , ' she reveals			2
' i 've had five wolves done and one of the last things @entity75 says to [ @entity78 ] when he realises he 's lost her			2
he said : " it would be as easy as breathing with me "			2
' perfect portrait : @entity81 , @entity82 and , of course , @entity84 have pride of place recovery : mrs @entity11 's obsession with @entity30 tattoos acts as a reminder to her of pulling through the depression and subsequent obesity after she lost her mother but despite her love for the @entity95 - the subject of an inking currently underway on her left leg - it 's @entity1 , played in the films by @entity84 , who interests her the most			1
' obviously , i 'm @entity1 so most of my tattoos are of @entity1 , ' she explains			1
' i 'm definitely a @entity84 fan			1
' it 's because he 's not classically good looking - he 's different , ' she adds			0
' i 'm not what i 'd call good looking , i 'm average and he 's similar			0
plenty of other guys in the film are better looking but he 's striking in different way			0
' since discovering @entity30 , @entity11 has lost an incredible six stone and says that having the tattoos is a permanent reminder of just how far she 's come since 1999 when the shock of losing her mother resulted in an unhealthy obsession with food			1
' that 's when i started going really hell for leather doing what i wanted and abusing my body , ' remembers @entity11			1
' i was sitting down , overeating , just vegetating all the time			2
i was ashamed of myself and what i looked like			0
' when my friend gave me the first book and i got well and truly hooked on it , it kind of focused me			0
of course , then i got the music , the soundtracks to all of the movies , so i got them out , i 'd exercise to them and i 'd be watching a dvd and i 'd just be exercising in front of them			0
trading comfort eating for @entity30 tattoos has n't come cheap - shes spent just under £ 8,500 on getting inked but expects to spend £ 25,000 in total getting covered ' and then i 'd get another tattoo and it 'd just give me something to focus on			1
i 've lost six stone and that 's what did it			0
' it 's a permanent reminder and a reward to me for getting my life back on track to what it should be			1
' but not everyone is as supportive of @entity11 's decision to get inked			1
although her husband @entity151 , to whom she 's been married for 21 years , tolerates her tattoos , not everyone in her family agrees			2
' my father , at first he was very resistant , ' she says			0
' he would n't be seen out with me			0
my brother , i have n't spoken to in five years			0
he 's quite embarrassed by me			0
' my sisters ... they 're just quite glad to see me come out of my shell and be who i should be			0
i used to be very quiet , sort of hide in the background , be a bit of a wallflower			0
' she certainly is n't anymore and revels in the stir she caused when she was invited onto the red carpet at the @entity170 part one premiere in 2011			0
' i got sent tickets to the premiere , which was brilliant although security would n't let me near the main characters , ' remembers @entity11 with a chuckle			1
' but the fans reaction was brilliant - it was an hour and a half of mayhem because they all wanted pictures with me			0
' her tattoos also got her the attention of @entity82 , the 21 - year - old @entity185 who plays @entity75 , who , to her delight , even mentioned her in an interview			2
tolerant : @entity11 's husband @entity151 says he is happy for her to have tattoos provided they do n't go on her face @entity193 : her right arm shows a line uttered by @entity75 that reads : ' it would be as easy as breathing with me ' so far mrs @entity11 's spent 91 hours under the needle , costing her £ 8,500 , but she still plans lots more and aims to cover her entire body ' @entity82 and @entity84 [ @entity84 ] were on this morning when breaking @entity72 came out and he [ @entity82 ] commented on my tattoos , ' adds @entity11			1
and @entity82 is n't alone in his appreciation of @entity11 's tattoo tribute			1
at a convention last year , she met @entity206 who plays @entity207 , a member of the @entity209 coven who come to the @entity1 's aid during a confrontation with the @entity212			2
' i 've not met any of the main characters , ' explains @entity11 , ' but i have met @entity207 ( @entity206 ) , @entity215 ( @entity214 ) and the guy who plays @entity217 ( @entity218 )			2
' it was at a convention last year and they all said it was brilliant artwork but to meet one of the main [ characters ] would have been great			0
' for now , @entity11 is focusing on finishing a tattoo of the @entity95 on her left leg and , once it 's done , plans to have another of the @entity212 inked on her right			2
does she have any plans to stop ? unsurprisingly , the answer is no. ' the way i look at it , i 've still got two to three years work to go and you need to do maintenance , ' she explains			0
' there 's always going to be things that need touching up or recolouring			0
' i stand out , i do n't care that i stand out , ' she adds			0
' this is me , this is what i like , this is what does it for me			0
it keeps me feeling young			0
' it 's keeping me permanently broke but no matter what the cost , i am not stopping ! ' mrs @entity11 says she piled on the pounds after the death of her mother , and spent most days comfort eating on the sofa @entity151 says he tolerates the tattoos but other family members have not been so understanding			1

@entity11 , 52 , from @entity48 has spent £ 8,500 on tattoos to date

says discovering @entity30 helped her focus on losing weight
