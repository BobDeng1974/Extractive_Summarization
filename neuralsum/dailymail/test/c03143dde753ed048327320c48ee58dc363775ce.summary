@entity0 has moved on to become a @entity2 tv star , and he left behind a stunning @entity4 physiotherapist to pursue his @entity2 dream , the @entity6 can reveal			1
the new host of @entity8 has separated from long term girlfriend @entity9 after the pair had a heart to heart about his future plans			2
@entity0 has known @entity14 for at least four years and it ’s believed they began dating early in 2014			1
the comedian quickly became smitten with the beautiful brunette and took her around the world to be by his side while on tour			2
but following behind - the - scenes talks earlier this year with @entity24 – the producers of @entity8 – it was clear @entity0 ’s career was about to explode			1
self - employed @entity14 , 28 , runs her own physiotherapist practice in @entity45 and has several family members in the city meaning she will have been reluctant to relocate to @entity2			1
a source close to @entity0 told @entity6 : ‘ @entity9 is an ex-girlfriend			1
they decided to go their separate ways and are not together anymore , they split a few months ago but are still friends			2
’ despite the split @entity14 is still right behind @entity0 as he takes over from @entity58 in the biggest seat in world comedy			1
she told @entity6 that she ’s ‘ very supportive ’ of @entity0 ’s newfound fame and has said she could n’t be ‘ prouder ’ of her ex. and while previously little known @entity0 is set to become a household name for millions of people , @entity14 still does n't see him as a ‘ celebrity ’			1
speaking in @entity45 , she said : ‘ yes he ’s going through this huge transition but at the end of the day he ’s not a celebrity to me and he ’s never treated himself like that and i do n’t treat him like that , i do n’t bring that in to my life			2
’ @entity14 was coy about their relationship and refused to discuss the split			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t need to show my support publicly for @entity0 , it does n’t need validating to anybody else besides me and him			2
anything that needs to be said i ’ve said to him personally			0
goofing around : @entity0 , pictured here with @entity14 making funny faces at the camera , was in @entity45 for his comedy tour at the end of february			1
it 's likely the couple talked about their relationship at this time having fun : the couple had several pictures together on @entity92 , and @entity14 had a picture of the pair kissing as her main profile picture until recently adventures : @entity14 told @entity6 that she 's ' very supportive ' of @entity0 's new - found fame , but would not discuss their relationship smiles : @entity0 poses with a group of statues in one of @entity14 's many pictures of the two of them during their travels ‘ this world is not a very healthy one , so we ca n’t really involve ourselves in it now regardless of how big it is			1
‘ it does n’t make a difference to my life			0
i do n’t talk about my stuff , @entity0 does n’t talk about my stuff			2
‘ there ’s really nothing more that i need to say , whatever ’s there is there , beyond that , it is genuinely between me and him			0
’ but it 's clear that @entity14 has struggled with the split , keeping her @entity92 status as ‘ in a relationship ’ and keeping a large photo of the couple kissing on her home page wall			1
however , the physio quickly changed her wall photo to one of three pretty dresses when @entity6 asked why she kept @entity0 ’s picture on display now they 've split			2
it ’s a sad turn of events for the couple who had seemed madly in love			2
in january it was suggested the glamorous pair was even engaged – rumors @entity14 was quick to quell on @entity148			1
dozens of intimate photos posted on their social media pages also gave the appearance of a couple very much in love			0
@entity0 , 31 – originally from @entity155 near @entity156 – even bought a love nest in @entity45 so he could be close to @entity14 during visits			1
local media reports claimed the jet - setting comic snapped up a luxury penthouse apartment in the exclusive 15 on @entity162 in @entity45 ’s city - center			1
staff at the hotel – which boasts a roof top swimming pool and spa - say they spotted @entity0 at his apartment as recently as last friday during a brief visit to @entity45			1
strong : @entity14 , who runs her own physiotherapy practice in @entity45 , is also a blue belt in @entity174 and has won gold medals in competitions it ’s believed @entity0 and @entity14 also bonded over their similar backgrounds in that they both have parents from different ethnic backgrounds against the backdrop of @entity183 in @entity4			1
@entity0 was born the son of a black @entity4 woman and a white @entity187 man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in @entity4			2
@entity14 runs her d gabriel physiotherapy practice out of the posh @entity191 gym in @entity192 , @entity45			1
and fortunately for @entity0 their split was n’t a fiery affair as @entity14 is a blue belt in @entity174			1
she became ‘ hooked ’ on the grappling based martial art in 2011 as she opened her practice and trains at the renowned @entity200			0
in june 2013 she won two gold medals for @entity204 in a @entity174 competition at the @entity206			0

@entity14 posted a photo on her @entity148 feed posing next to the world - renowned @entity174 expert			2
and she is so crazy about the sport that during a trip to @entity231 in august last year with @entity0 she dropped in on the @entity233 tournament			2
she told unan1mous.co.za : ' i genuinely love the sport and how it constantly challenges and equips your brain as much as your body			0
‘ more than anything , it gives you a universal language that gains you an instant family / home base when traveling			0
just remember to pack in your gi and you ’re good to go ! ’ during @entity0 ’s @entity2 tour last year @entity14 posted loved - up couple selfies of them seeing the sites in @entity215 and @entity249 on @entity250			1

’ @entity14 also regularly retweeted her boyfriend ’s @entity148 jokes and show dates and is a big fan of @entity6 often posting stories from our site			0
and on january 27 this year while @entity0 was in @entity2 , @entity14 , who was clearly missing her boyfriend , tweeted : ‘ hey @entity215 , get your s * * * * together so my man can fly home			1
i need help opening this jar ; (			0
’ judging by the photos they had shared , the pair would have made the perfect celebrity couple , especially if @entity14 had made the move to be by her man ’s side in the @entity281			2
on @entity282 ’s weekend last year @entity14 posted a series of stunning shots of them together on a boat sailing around the @entity287 with @entity0 ’s good friend , @entity4 radio dj @entity288 and her boyfriend			1
support : even after the couple split , @entity14 has been supportive of @entity0 , having tweeted a proud message after it was announced that @entity0 would be @entity58 's replacement on @entity8 but after their split @entity14 was supportive			1
as recently as march 30 , after news broke that @entity0 was @entity58 ’s replacement , @entity14 tweeted : ‘ i knew you had it in you and they saw it too now the world gets to share it			1
’ but perhaps the writing had always been on the wall			0
interestingly , while things seem to be going amazingly well in their relationship , @entity6 has learned that @entity0 never introduced @entity14 to his family in @entity156			1
@entity309 , 56 , revealed : ‘ i ’ve not met her , i do n’t know anything about the two because @entity0 has n’t told me			0
‘ i leave the kids to enjoy themselves , i do n’t ask about such things			0
as a mother i ask one favor from my sons , “ keep your women away until you decide to settle with them ”			0
' @entity309 said one of @entity0 ’s other ex-girlfriends was ‘ controlling ’ over him			0
‘ she was a @entity323 girl and i saw her and i really liked her , i was hooked			0
but then it was broken			0
she was very controlling over @entity0 and he did n’t like that , ’ she said			0
even @entity0 admitted during an interview that one of his ex girlfriend ’s tried to stop him from going in to comedy			0
he told @entity331 in may , 2013 : ‘ i was dating her and i said , " i want to be a comedian			0
" and she said , " you 're not that funny , do n't be stupid			0
" so i said , " okay			0
" and i did n't do it			0
then , after we broke up , i thought , this is the perfect time to do everything i could n't do when i was with her , like date other girls and do comedy			0

@entity0 was in a relationship with @entity4 beauty @entity9 but the couple have split in recent months
he took her around the world to be by his side on his tour last year
it was even rumored in january that the madly in - love couple were engaged
but @entity14 , 28 , runs a physiotherapist practice in @entity45 and has family in the city meaning she will have been reluctant to relocate to @entity2
she still remains supportive of @entity0 and ' could n't be prouder ' of him
