tax rises and benefit cuts passed by the @entity2 have cost the average household £ 1,127 a year – with the poorest families with children the hardest hit , a new report has revealed			2
while the richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms , poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income , the @entity7 said			1
middle earners and the very rich have escaped ' remarkably unscathed ' from the government 's austerity programme - with those without children actually gaining financially from the changes , largely due to increases in the threshold for paying income tax , said the @entity7			1
the richest 10 per cent have lost the most in cash terms since 2010 , the @entity7 said but poor parents have lost the most as a percentage of their income , the respected economic think tank said pensioners were ' relatively unaffected ' on average , as their gains from the ' triple lock ' on the state pension were largely offset by the hike in @entity30			1
@entity31 said the findings were proof of a ' clear betrayal ' by @entity35 of his promise to lead the most family - friendly government ever			0
looking at these changes , the poorest households lost around 4 per cent of their incomes , compared with around 3.5 per cent for the next poorest tenth , between 2.5 per cent and zero for middle - income households and a loss of about 2.5 per cent for the richest			1
the @entity7 found that families with four or more children lost 6.9 per cent of their income as a result of the tax and benefit changes under study - an average £ 2,941 - compared with a loss of 4.5 per cent for three - child families , 3.5 per cent for those with two children , 2.6 per cent for those with one and 0.4 per cent for childless households			1
non-working lone parents were the worst - hit household type , losing about £ 1,837 a year from the changes under study , though the @entity7 said the average loss was skewed upwards by a small number of households affected by measures such as the benefits cap and national caps on local housing allowance rates			1
hardest - hit region was @entity68 , where households lost an average £ 1,042 , followed by the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
@entity76 , a senior research economist at @entity7 and co-author of the report said : ' whichever way you cut it , low - income households with children and the very richest households have lost out significantly from the changes as a percentage of their incomes			1
' increases in the tax - free personal allowance have played an important role in protecting middle - income working - age households meaning that those without children have actually gained overall			1
' the hardest - hit region is @entity68 , where households have lost an average £ 1,042 a year , followed by the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 the chancellor @entity89 has introduced tax rises and benefit cuts costing the average family more than £ 1,000 a year @entity94 spokeswoman @entity93 said : ' this report shows that tax and benefit changes under this government have left households £ 1,127 a year worse off on average			2
' families with children have been hit hardest of all by @entity35 's choices - a clear betrayal of his promise to lead the most family - friendly government ever			2
' for all the government 's claims , this report shows that they have raised tax by over £ 13.5 billion a year			0
and for millions of working people the rise in vat and cuts to things like tax credits have more than offset changes to the personal allowance			0
' the @entity116 are now promising to cut tax credits again for millions of working families and refusing to rule out another vat rise to pay for their unfunded promises			2
it 's clear working people ca n't afford five more years of this government			0
' @entity31 's economic plan will ensure we earn our way to rising living standards for all and balance the books in a fairer way			0
we will reverse this government 's £ 3 billion - a - year tax cut for the top 1 per cent of earners and help 24 million working people with a lower 10p starting rate of tax			2
' a @entity94 spokeswoman said : ' today 's report from the @entity7 confirms that the richest have lost the most from the government 's changes to taxes and welfare			1
' treasury analysis has shown throughout the @entity144 that the richest 10 per cent of households have made the largest contribution to reducing the deficit			1
' @entity148 presents the most complete , rigorous and detailed record of the impact of this government 's policies on households			0
at the @entity155 this confirmed that the richest 20 per cent of households will contribute more to reducing the deficit than the remaining 80 per cent put together			0
' fairness is at the heart of our approach to reducing the deficit			0
our analysis shows how our commitment to fairness is not a matter of rhetoric : it is reflected in the policy choices we have made			0
' @entity170 income inequality is now lower than when this government came into office and the recovery is being felt across the country			0
but the only sustainable way to raise living standards for all is to keep working through the plan that is securing a better future across the country			0
