by @entity0 in a sales pitch gone wrong , a pilot salesman was lucky to escape uninjured alongside his two passengers after the aircraft he was flying crashed into a backyard			1
the pilot , 62 - year - old @entity7 according to the @entity8 , was demonstrating how the @entity10 aircraft he was flying could recover from a stall on may 10 when he lost control of the plane , according to a report of the incident released by the @entity16			1
' watch this , ' mr @entity7 was reported to have said shortly before the plane 's right wing dropped rapidly , sending the aircraft into a spin			1
the passenger in the front seat of the aircraft claimed it was at this point that mr @entity7 clearly stated ' i 'm sorry '			2
about 2,000 feet above the ground , the pilot released the aircraft 's parachute			1
narrowly avoiding some nearby power lines , the plane collided with the branches of a tree before crashing down onto a resident 's fence			1
the plane landed in the front yard of @entity23 property belonging to @entity52 who appeared more concerned that her nap had been interrupted in an interview with the @entity56			2
the 66 - year - old told the publication that she heard loud bangs but did n't think anything of it , saying that her first thought was ' there 's no peace '			0
none of the three people aboard were injured after the plane landed in the front yard of @entity23 resident @entity52 's property ' when i first saw it i thought " that 's a surprise "			1
but i really am glad that no - one got hurt			0
it could have been awful , the bush could have gone up , people could have got hurt			0
it â€™s the only place they could have landed neatly , ' ms @entity52 said			0
the passenger in the front seat claimed that once the plane had come to its resting position , he had to shake the pilot who he described as appearing ' dazed ' , urging him to ' hurry up and open the door and exit the aircraft '			2
he claims he was also forced to switch the ignition and master switches and fuel selector off , as the pilot had previously failed to do so			0
the report stated that mr @entity7 claimed he had performed the same manoeuvre earlier that day with no problems , however he admitted that ' he was probably overconfident as he had done the demonstration 30 - 50 times in the previous six months ' .			0
