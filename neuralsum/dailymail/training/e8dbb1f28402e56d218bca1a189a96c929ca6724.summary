people who derive their happiness from helping others , like @entity5 , have strong antibody genes , @entity1 scientists claim @entity8 scientists have found different types of happiness have surprisingly contrary effects on our genes			1
@entity1 research found that people who derive their happiness from helping others have strong antibody genes , while people who get their kicks from self - gratification can suffer from low antiviral and anitbody gene expression			1
the study , which also involved the @entity23 , is the first of its kind to examine how positive psychology impacts human gene expression			0
people who are do - gooders have high levels of ' eudaimonic well - being '			2
they derive their happiness from a deep sense of purpose and meaning in life showed favourable gene - expression profiles in their immune cells			1
those studied from this happiness group had low levels of inflammatory gene expression and strong antibody and antiviral genes			2
however , individuals who have high levels of ' hedonic well - being ' - the type of happiness that comes from consuming goods and self - gratification - showed the opposite			1
this group of people showed high inflammation and weak antibody and antiviral genes			2
the study 's findings were published in the journal @entity58			0
the research , led by @entity60 , a @entity1 professor of medicine and @entity62 of the @entity23 , has taken a decade			0
the scientists have looked at how the human genome responds to fear , stress , misery and other negative mental states , but focused on how human genes might respond to positive psychology in this study			2
they studied the biological implications of hedonic and eudaimonic well - being through some 21,000 genes			0
previous research found immune cells show a shift in baseline gene expression profiles during times of uncertainty , stress and fear			1
the shift is characteristised by an increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and less of those involved in antiviral and antibody functions			0
individuals who had high levels of ' hedonic well - being ' - the type of happiness that comes from consuming goods ( pictured ) showed high inflammation and weak antibody and antiviral genes professor @entity60 believes the response probably evolved to help human immune systems cope with the changing nature of microbial threat associated with changing social and environmental conditions at the time			1
the threats included bacterial infection from wounds produced by fighting and increased risk of viral infections as people lived closer together and became more sociable			0
professor @entity60 said : ' in contemporary society and our very different environment , chronic activation by social or symbolic threats can promote inflammation and cause cardiovascular , neurodegenerative and other diseases and can impair resistance to viral infections			0
' in the present study , the researchers drew blood samples from 80 healthy adults who were assessed for hedonic and eudaimonic well - being , as well as negative psychological and behavioral factors			0
the study concluded that doing good and feeling good have very different effects on the human genome , even though they generate similar levels of positive emotion			1
human chromosomes under a scanning probe microscope are pictured the team used the gene - expression profile to map the potentially distinct biological effects of hedonic and eudaimonic well - being			1
the study found people with eudaimonic well - being showed favorable gene - expression profiles in their immune cells and those with hedonic well - being showed an adverse gene - expression profile			1
but interestingly professor @entity60 said : ' people with high levels of hedonic well - being did n't feel any worse than those with high levels of eudaimonic well - being			0
' ' both seemed to have the same high levels of positive emotion			2
however , their genomes were responding very differently even though their emotional states were similarly positive			0
' ' what this study tells us is that doing good and feeling good have very different effects on the human genome , even though they generate similar levels of positive emotion			1
' apparently , the human genome is much more sensitive to different ways of achieving happiness than are conscious minds			0
