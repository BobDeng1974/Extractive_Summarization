@entity1 legend @entity0 is adamant that @entity3 referees must be more willing to give penalties when there is an excessive amount of pushing and shoving in the box			1
although @entity0 believes that football is a contact sport and therefore coming togethers are inevitable , he does not believe officials are being stringent enough with penalising offenders who overstep the mark			2
the 41 - year - old former @entity15 midfielder is just the latest high - profile sportsman to show support for @entity17 's @entity19 campaign			1
@entity0 shows his support to @entity21 's @entity19 campaign at the @entity24 event in association with @entity26 on monday a member of @entity1 's ' @entity29 ' side who went the whole season unbeaten in 2003 - 04 on the way to the @entity3 title , @entity0 knows what it takes to win tight football matches but he believes players such as @entity38 's @entity37 have overstepped the mark			1
@entity0 , who was helping to launch @entity26 's new @entity40 at the @entity41 , told @entity17 : ' it 's a contact sport and really you 've got to be tight to your man when defending in the box but sometimes it can go too far			1
you 're told in training do n't let him score â€“ it 's as simple as that			2
' i think the referee has got to go into the dressing room before the game and say : ' look , i 'm expecting contact but as soon as that ball 's kicked i 'll be looking around and seeing who 's holding who '			0
then if people do hold each other that should be a penalty			0
' we saw @entity37 give one away and he 's not the only one but he 's done it before			0
' @entity38 's @entity37 ( right ) conceded a penalty for this grapple with @entity65 's @entity64 last week however , @entity0 believes football must remain a contact sport and that officials need to be careful with how they do decide to punish offenders			2
join @entity17 's @entity19 campaign by parading the logo at matches ... you could also win an @entity15 shirt signed by @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 by tweeting your support @entity0 - who won three @entity3 titles , four @entity80 , a @entity81 and @entity82 during his time at @entity1 - believes the majority of those successes were built on a strong defensive unit , and that sometimes they got away with using the dark arts to prevent goals			1
he continued : ' it is a contact sport though so we have to be careful not to remove all of that			0
' if you say that you ca n't touch someone at a corner , he 's going to run straight across you , you do n't know when he 's going to run and then he 's going to get ahead of you			0
as a defender you 're taught to be tight and do n't let them move			0
' but it 's when they 're holding someone back with the obvious ones that they 've got to clamp down on			0
' @entity26 is the @entity103 partner of @entity1			2
@entity26 invited @entity1 legend @entity0 to support the launch of its new @entity40 at @entity106 .			1
