by @entity0 these are the stomach - churning pictures of the world ’s tallest water slide			0
towering over the landscape at a whopping 41 metres high , it is the equivalent of a 14 - storey building			1
@entity8 has been listed in the @entity9 and brave riders plummet down the slide at a nerve - shredding speed , reaching around 65 miles an hour			1
the plunge is so steep that although riders travel 41 metres , the whole ride takes just four or five seconds			1
constructed in 1989 , the thrill ride attracts dare devils from all over the world			0
@entity29 , who works at the beach park , said : ' i 'm a @entity21 and i work at the water park - it 's funny to watch the tourists starts panicking and sometimes they really start crying			2
normally they 're all @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
' one rider commented : ' when you slide down , you basically fly because the fall is too steep so you 're in mid-air for most of it			0
' thrill : the water slide towers above the landscape , offering incredible views of the @entity49			0
dare devils reach speeds of up to 65 miles an hour for safety reasons @entity22 only allows travel in a single position – on your back with arms and legs crossed			0
however with such hair - raising speeds it is hard to imagine this would be a problem for most as it is unlikely many would want to plunge down head first			1
@entity8 can be found in @entity66 , @entity21 , and for those not distracted by the significant drop below it offers great views of the @entity49 from the top			2
aaaaah ! : the stomach slide plummets 41 metres in just four or five seconds safe return : at the end of the descent the slide levels off and deposits riders safely in a swimming pool to relax the waterfall is in @entity66 in north - eastern @entity21			1
