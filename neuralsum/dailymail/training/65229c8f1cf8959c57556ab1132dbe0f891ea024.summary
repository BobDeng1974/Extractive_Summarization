by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is relishing the chance to take on @entity4 at @entity5 this week and prove that he is the ‘ complete player ’ as well as a worthy successor to the golfing superstar as world no 1			1
@entity2 took over at the top of the rankings for the first time in may and admits that there is added pressure on his shoulders to prove himself , especially with the long - awaited return to the game of the 14 - time major champion , who has spent a staggering 683 weeks as the top - ranked player in the game during his career			1
woods missed the cut in his only competitive start since undergoing back surgery in march , but @entity2 insists that @entity4 is still the man every player has his eye on at @entity27 this week			1
heading out there this week everyone will have an eye on @entity4			0
but there ’s so many other guys in form you do n’t just focus on him			0
’ @entity2 infamously bogeyed the final four holes while leading at @entity51 in 2012 to throw away the @entity52 , so has extra incentive to prove himself against a man who has lifted the game ’s oldest prize on three occasions			1
‘ it would be incredibly special to win @entity5 as world no 1 this week , ’ said the 33 - year - old @entity31			1
‘ but there ’s such a significance to this tournament , it would give me a feeling of being complete as a player and for my career			2
you ’d be sitting back and basking in glory with the @entity52			2
’ back in the field : three - time open champion @entity4 will be back competing at @entity27 all smiles : and he looks in high spirits as he aims to win another major @entity2 admitted that there is added pressure on him this week due to his position as the new man on top of the perch and in living up to the standard set by @entity4			1
however the former @entity37 champion concedes that he will not be able to emulate @entity4 ’s achievements , which include a mind - blowing 79 @entity83 victories - three short of @entity86 ’s all - time record - as well as his major haul , which remains four shy of the mark set by @entity89 ‘ my own expectations of playing well every week are quite high			0
but certainly there is that feeling you somewhat have to validate the position every week you are no 1 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity4 did this exceptional job of playing golf as world no 1			2
those shoes ca n’t be filled by one guy			0
there definitely is the added pressure of having to perform at a high level every week when you ’re world no 1			2
’ disaster : @entity2 infamously threw away the title in 2012 after five bogeys in the final five holes heartache : and he reacts to missing the shots that cost him his first ever major despite having to live up to the comparisons , @entity2 is relaxed and ready for @entity5 , which is the one prize he covets above all others in the game			1
and @entity2 is also appreciative of the chance to test himself against arguably the greatest player of all time – and certainly the most high - profile - once again			1
‘ i think everyone is so happy to see him back on the golf course because he ’s so huge for the game of golf and we all know that			0
whether he hits form this week or not is not really the big thing			0
the fact he ’s back playing is important for us all and brings so much interest to the game			0
’ @entity128 aiming for prizes not points			0

wants to prove himself as ' complete player ' after becoming world no 1
the @entity31 hoping to add his second major to 2013 masters win
