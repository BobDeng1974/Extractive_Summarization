by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 10:55 est , 13 april 2012 the wonderfully heart - warming story of a nine - year - old boy whose amazing homemade cardboard box arcade made him an internet sensation has taken yet another astonishing twist			0
since video of @entity10 ’s intricate games went viral after being uploaded to @entity11 , donors have pledged $ 117,000 to help put the lad through college			1
@entity14 had only hoped to have some fun with a few customers when he turned his father 's @entity18 auto parts store into a makeshift arcade out of old discarded boxes			1
now he has been offered a real arcade game worth thousands but from the moment a passing filmmaker happened across the schoolboy ’s astonishingly intricate creation , events have taken one twist after another			2
a flash mob of hundreds descended on his father ’s garage to play after seeing @entity44 ’s video			1
then the owner of an @entity18 pinball shop heard about events and invited @entity14 to her store and meet professional pinballers			2
@entity14 visited @entity50 , a pinball and tailoring shop , played on a real pinball machine for the first time in his life			0
the store 's owner , @entity56 , was reportedly so impressed with the boy that she offered him one of several pinball machines , which cost as much as $ 3,000 , for free			1
but the good fortune did n't stop there			0
mr @entity44 – who also works for a media strategy company - had also added a line at the bottom of the film 's @entity11 description saying : ‘ @entity14 's @entity67 ’			1
welcoming : @entity56 , the owner of @entity50 in @entity18 , is behind the generous gift on offer : the shop owner reportedly offered @entity14 a @entity72 pinball machine , which is worth $ 3,000 it linked to a blog with a @entity76 widget titled ‘ @entity77 : @entity78 in $ 1 or more to help @entity14 go to college			1

the generous gifts and donations comes after @entity14 spent his summer vacation collecting empty boxes used for shipping and creating an elaborate arcade , complete with prize displays , gifts bags , and a security system involving calculators			1
the arcade grew to take up his father 's whole store and included handmade soccer games , a claw machine he devised himself and built in hand - fed ticket dispensers			1
‘ @entity14 does not pass by an arcade without stopping in , he loves tickets , playing games , he loves prizes so it was only natural for him to build his own arcade , ’ his father @entity100 said			2
‘ he loves to see how things are built , he takes all his toys apart to see how they work , he ca n’t put them back together but he takes them apart			0
’ forever growing : @entity14 's arcade grew bigger as he continued adding to it over the course of the summer creative : @entity14 made his arcade by hand using cardboard boxes and toys he collects from places he visits @entity120 thought out : the nine - year - old 's arcade is complete with prize displays , gifts bags , and a security system involving calculators but the schoolboy ’s chances of attracting customers to his intricate arcade were very slim , as his father ’s store is in an industrial part of the city and has very little foot foot traffic			1

‘ i was like this kid ’s is a genius ... i was blown away			0
’ @entity44 was so impressed that he asked @entity14 's father if he could film a short movie about his son 's arcade			1
