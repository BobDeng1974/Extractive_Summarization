their debut @entity3 video of them miming to @entity6 's hit song ' @entity7 ' attracted 18 million hits , caught the attention of @entity10 , and was credited by @entity11 with causing a staggering 261 per cent surge in the streaming of the iconic song			1
and now @entity17 - based trio @entity15 are back with a second hilarious car jam titled ' mime through @entity20 ' featuring over 14 classic songs from the 40s through to now ... and this time they appear naked			1
the stunning models turned comedy act , comprised of @entity25 , 28 , @entity26 , 25 , @entity27 , 27 , became an overnight sensation when they released ' @entity30 ' last month			1
' we had no idea it would have such an incredible response			0
the fact that we 've had people writing to us from around the world ... i do n't think there 's been a country or continent that has n't reached out and written to us to say they loved it			0
' @entity25 , 28 , says the reason she thinks they 've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable , people love the song , it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a ' rock out ' to it			1
another reason behind the @entity17 trio 's success is the natural sex appeal they inject into the humorous skit			1
as models who met through the same agency , @entity25 admits while they are aware of their attractiveness they 've chosen to incorporate it into the act in a way that defies the typical ' pretty girl ' stereotype and still empowers women			0
' unlike what might be synonymous with an attractive girl , we want to be crazy , let our hair down , and break the rules a bit			0
but we still like to wear make - up and dress up - we just want be able to make fun of what we do while empowering women to be comfortable in their own skin			2
' beatle mania : a dramatic rendition of ' help ' by the @entity112 @entity114 baby : ' @entity115 ' with references to @entity117 's dark days elvis in the house : @entity118 's ' @entity121 ' debuts in traditional full body suits in their latest hit ' mime through @entity20 ' , you can definitely expect even more sex appeal with the final scene including a rip - off of @entity42 's ' @entity47 ' in which the girls go completely topless in their now famous @entity130			1
@entity25 admits the scene ( which was filmed in the car of her dad 's back drive way ) was a definite risk and two alternative ends were filmed in case it came across as too risqu√©			2
' when i first told mum she said " oooh , i do n't know " but then when they saw it they cracked up and think it 's a great joke ... my mum was more shocked by the fact i looked so much like my brother in the slim shady scene ... which i 'm not sure is a good thing			0
' the girls only use the bare essentials to produce the clip			0
' the first time we had a bra in the car so we taped the @entity156 to it and propped it up that way , but this time we upgraded to a block of wood , but it 's still very dodgy , ' says @entity25			2
getting thrifty : fur coats and bling showcased in the mime of @entity165 's ' @entity164 ' painting the town : face paint featured as key costume in @entity170 's ' somebody that i used to know ' going ghetto : gangster moves and flipped up hoods for @entity175 and @entity177 's ' @entity176 ' as for the car setting itself , while the girls plan to continue jamming it out in the @entity130 , they admit there are restrictions			1
' the very first take we did of the @entity118 song , there 's a bit where we do a canon with our face down and i completely head - butted the steering wheel			2
@entity26 just cracked up laughing and did n't ask if i 'm okay , guess that sums up our friendship completely , ' says @entity25			0
when asked what the girls hope the audience will take away from their latest clip , @entity25 says as long as they laugh out loud at some point she 'll be happy			0
but a good reminisce is also great too			0
next up for the girls after the release of new clip ' @entity203 in @entity20 ' that 's out today is a trip to @entity205 for two weeks to line up a series of interviews in which they hope lands them a partner with a hope to start their own comedy show			1
we also hear new modes of transport will be included in part two of the @entity15 skits and there may even be a blooper reel on it 's way ... stay tuned			0
