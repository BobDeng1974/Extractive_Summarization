with a trusting gaze , silky ears and the fluffiest of coats , this little pup would melt the hardest of hearts			2
his owner , however , must have had no heart at all			1
she abandoned him , frightened and bewildered , in the ladies ’ toilets at a motorway service station			1
staff found him hours later cowering at the back of a cubicle , curled up in a ball and whimpering in fear			1
cute : the miniature @entity18 sheepdog was discovered in the ladies toilets at a service station in @entity21 , @entity22			1
vets will carry out tests to see if his sight can be restored they soon realised the pup , thought to be a miniature @entity18 sheepdog and about eight weeks old , was blind			1
and they believe his owner , hoping to cash in on the trend for tiny ‘ designer ’ dogs , realised this made him worthless and abandoned him			1
his cries had alerted a customer , who told staff that there was a strange noise in the toilets			1
‘ he had been left in a cubicle behind the bin , ’ said @entity43 , director of the @entity45 services at @entity21 in @entity22			1
‘ he was curled up and looked frightened			0
’ she said colleague @entity49 , who works in the @entity50 at the site , had found the pup			2
‘ she managed to coax him out and we cleaned him up and wrapped him in one of the dog blankets we have on sale			0
abandoned : the dog , nicknamed @entity59 by customers , was found in the toilets at a service station in @entity21 , @entity22 ‘ he had these piercing blue eyes , but he was n’t making direct eye contact , which was when we realised he was blind			1
’ the sad start in life for this puppy illustrates the lottery of buying a so - called designer dog			2
while his history may never be known , he is thought to be a miniature @entity18 sheepdog – which not a recognised breed in this country and is seen as part of the celebrity - driven fashion for tiny ‘ handbag ’ dogs			1
these pets are often associated with health problems as they are frequently the product of unscrupulous backstreet ‘ puppy farmers ’			0
they can also be imported from abroad , and are sold online for £ 500 or more			0
according to the @entity87 , one in five puppies bought through websites or social media die within six months			0
in the @entity91 , breeders have raised fears that puppies sold as miniature @entity18 sheepdogs are prone to weak bones , water on the brain and blood sugar disorders			1
sadly some will be abandoned by disappointed buyers			2
@entity101 sheepdogs are normally around 14in tall , though can be anywhere from 13in to 16in			0
staff have examined @entity105 footage of the entrance to the services but believe the woman who abandoned the puppy hid him from sight as she went to the toilets			1
there are no other clues to her identity			2
‘ all we can think is that she found out he was blind and decided to dump him , ’ mrs @entity43 said			1
‘ it was an awful thing to do			0
’ but despite his difficult start in life , the puppy has at least found a happy ending			2
after being rescued three weeks ago , he was adopted by the services ’ maintenance manager @entity128 , who already has a terrier named @entity130 and could n’t resist the pup			0
‘ @entity130 has been like a mother to him , ’ mrs @entity43 added			0
‘ she acts as his eyes and barks out instructions to him			0
’ and now staff have set up an online appeal to raise money to cover the pup ’s veterinary bills – which include a consultation with a specialist to see whether his sight can be restored			2
last night it had raised £ 540			0
workers and customers have also been paying £ 1 each to vote for the puppy ’s new name , with the total – currently around £ 120 – going towards cancer charities			0
the leading choice so far is @entity59 , after the loo where he was discovered			0
‘ the saving grace is that he was left where people would find him , ’ mrs @entity43 said .			0
