read @entity1 's full statement here @entity3 's future at adidas @entity3 's incredible 39 games banned for his three bites on opposition @entity3 fans flocked to @entity9 near @entity10 to greet the arrival of the banned striker back in @entity13			1
having been handed a nine - game international ban and four - month suspension from all football , @entity3 travelled back to @entity13 and left the @entity19 squad			1
supporters turned out in force to greet the @entity23 striker in @entity13 , with some wearing masks in tribute to their star man			1
@entity28 president @entity27 was at the international airport at one point , but returned home because @entity3 's flight was delayed			1
@entity3 was earlier seen with the rest of the team in @entity74 as they were pictured arriving at their hotel			1
@entity13 face @entity77 in an all @entity79 last 16 clash , but they will have to make do without @entity3 for that game and the rest of the tournament			2
but there is no chance of @entity3 appearing at @entity89 2014 again and his future at @entity23 is also plunged into uncertainty through the length of the suspension			1
@entity1 ’s strict regulations barring him from any involvement in football mean he can not even watch @entity23 or @entity13 in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from @entity23 ’s @entity136 training ground			1
@entity3 can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but can not personally join in negotiations in mooted moves to @entity142 or @entity143			1
@entity23 are taking specialist legal advice before deciding what to do about @entity3 — a world - class footballer who comes with more baggage than any other elite star			1
given the length of his ban , @entity23 , who have not been contacted by @entity1 or the @entity13 @entity151 , feel aggrieved to be punished for something in which they had no part			1
the news was greeted with dismay by the club ’s owners in @entity159			0
ouch : @entity85 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity161 bite night ! @entity3 holds his teeth after the biting incident during the @entity19 against @entity85 not fooling anyone : @entity3 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity85 @entity167 hands @entity23 problem @entity13 @entity151 president @entity169 said : ‘ we are preparing our appeal to present to @entity1 in the next few hours			1
it ’s an extremely excessive punishment , there was not enough evidence and i have seen more aggressive incidents			0
it feels like @entity13 have been thrown out of the @entity19			0
we all know what @entity3 means to @entity13 and to football around the world			1
@entity3 will travel home to recover with his family			2
’ following this third , high - profile biting incident , it is no surprise that @entity3 ’s major sponsor adidas are thinking of ditching him			2
he has already been punished for racially abusing @entity187 and biting @entity188			0
a statement said : ‘ @entity190 does not condone @entity3 ’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players			2
we have no plan to use @entity3 for any additional marketing activities during the @entity19			2
we will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with @entity3 and his team after the tournament			2
’ another of @entity3 ’s backers , 888poker , are likely to drop him , with a spokesman saying : ‘ 888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			2
’ on message : tube commuters found out about the lengthy ban given to @entity3 on the digital screen on the ball : the news broke just before the busy evening rush hour jaws : a @entity217 fan pretends @entity3 is biting him as he poses for a photograph next to an advert the independent @entity1 disciplinary committee , chaired by @entity221 of @entity222 , reached the decision to hand @entity3 a @entity19 record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over wednesday night and thursday morning before it was announced at @entity1 ’s daily briefing at the @entity227			2
the player and the @entity13 @entity151 had been informed minutes beforehand			0
the suspension starts with immediate effect			0
the committee took into account that this was the third time @entity3 had bitten an opponent			0
his first victim was @entity237 ’s @entity236 in 2010 , for which he received a seven - match ban , and then @entity239 ’s @entity188 in 2013 , which brought a 10 - game ban			0
@entity221 said : ‘ such behaviour can not be tolerated and in particular not at a @entity19 when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field			0
the disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of mr @entity3 ’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code			0
’ the @entity28 media claimed that @entity221 ’s committee had come under pressure from @entity260 chiefs , including the @entity263 - hating @entity262 football president @entity261 , not to punish @entity3 too severely			1
@entity264 that ! @entity3 will not be able to play for @entity23 until the end of october decision maker : @entity221 said the incident ' could not be tolerated on any football pitch ' chomping at the bit : @entity3 appears bites @entity85 during @entity13 's 1 - 0 win against @entity272 but @entity1 insisted that there was no interference at all in the process			1
the world body ’s president @entity276 had been in @entity278 watching @entity222 beat @entity279 and flew back to @entity74 while the @entity3 hearing was going on			0
meanwhile , the @entity281 , who made @entity3 their player of the year last season , decided not to strip the @entity23 star of his title			1
@entity13 face @entity77 in the last 16 on saturday @entity288 defender @entity287 said the team were ‘ more united than ever ’ , while the country ’s sports minister @entity290 commented : ‘ we are hurt by this excessive sanction			0
now let ’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for @entity13			0
’ @entity299 ’s @entity1 vice-president @entity298 said : ‘ the punishment is fully justified			0
hopefully he will realise now that behaviour of this type will not be tolerated			0
’ @entity3 's bans for various bites now total 39 games			0
