by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 laughs off the suggestion he signed for @entity3 this summer simply to score a hat - trick of @entity6 clubs , having started at @entity7 before switching to @entity8			1
but he admits his enthusiasm had waned during a three - year spell at @entity11 and believes returning to the hotbed of tribalism he used to call home will trigger a purple period in his career			1
‘ it ’s not a puzzle that i ’m trying to complete , it ’s a career i want to fulfil , ’ explains @entity1 , born in @entity18			1
‘ people say @entity11 is only three hours away but it ’s that you ’re not seeing your friends every day , you ’re not seeing your family every day			1
if you ’re happy at home you ’re happy at your job			2
keeping up appearances : @entity1 signed for @entity3 at the beginning of the summer having a laugh ! the midfielder refuted suggestions he wanted to complete a @entity6 hat - trick ‘ i ’m a brummie through and through as it ’s where i feel i ’ve played my best football			1
i had a good career at @entity7 , a really good career at @entity8 , and i want to better that now at @entity3			1
’ @entity1 , a @entity8 fan as a boy , is well versed in the tangled rivalries having been brought up in a house of six brothers whose allegiances are split			1
‘ there ’s always fights going on , ’ he says			2
his brother @entity46 , 22 , plays for and supports @entity7 , penning a new contract at the club this summer despite suffering lengthy injuries the past couple of seasons			2
last week he played a prank on his older sibling by buying @entity1 ’s two daughters claret - and - blue kits with ‘ niece ’ on the backs and posting a photograph on @entity58			1
‘ he got me , ’ says @entity1 , 27 , with a smile			1
‘ but as i told him , what goes around comes around			2
there ’s a bit more toilet roll in the house now ! ’ the episode gives an illustration of what @entity1 had missed during his time at @entity11 ; regular interaction with his large family and snappy mickey - taking			1
‘ banter , ’ he says			0
@entity1 left @entity7 in january 2010 when opportunities became limited , with manager @entity75 able to pick from a number of expensive signings			1
now it is @entity3 paying eight - figure fees , as they did for @entity81 centre forward @entity80 , and capturing the likes of @entity83 , who @entity7 had wanted			0
‘ we ’re going out spending £ 10million on a striker and bringing in @entity83 and other players who @entity88 teams are after , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ they ’re choosing us			0
i think @entity3 are on the up			0
‘ when i was there @entity7 had @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97			0
we had some top - class players and were fighting for the top six			0
’ the purse strings have tightened since then and brother @entity46 , an academy graduate with @entity102 under 21 caps , may have a leading role to perform this season			2
‘ i ask him after all the training sessions how he ’s fitting in , how he ’s done , how ’s @entity106 , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ i ’m his biggest fan			0
it shows how good he is when he ’s been injured for two years and they give him another contract			0
this season is a big one for him			2
’ it is a campaign that @entity1 wants to seize too			1
he was limited to substitute appearances as @entity11 pulled off a ‘ miracle ’ survival under @entity114			1
he did not start a league game after december 4			0
a move to the @entity118 ‘ really nearly happened in january ’			1
looking ahead : @entity1 , formerly of @entity7 and @entity8 , wants to seize this season at @entity3 his first game in a @entity3 shirt will be the visit of @entity11 on saturday			1
‘ even though i was n’t getting the game time it was hard to dislike @entity114 because he ’s a good manager , ’ @entity1 says			1
his boss now is @entity126 , a head coach whose appointment initially shocked fans			1
but his credibility is increasing as a growing contingent of players enthuse over his methods			0
‘ before you judge him you need to watch his training sessions , you need to be in the dressing room , you need to really know him , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ on the training pitch we get well - set drills that relate to proper games			2
he does n’t just talk for the sake of it			0
i ’ve worked under a lot of people but coach-wise @entity126 is probably the best			2
he ’s very , very good			0
’ @entity1 thinks striker @entity80 , who scored 33 goals in 74 games at @entity149 , can cause a surprise too			1
‘ he runs the channels , gets hold of the ball , can turn and he knows where the net is			0
not many people know what he ’s like and they might give him that extra yard			0
that ’s all it needs nowadays			0
’ happy days ! @entity1 moved back to the @entity161 on a free after a spell up in @entity11 on a personal level @entity1 , a sweet striker of the ball from distance , has set himself a target of 10 goals from midfield to ensure last season ’s 17th - place finish was truly a ‘ blip ’ for the @entity3			1
‘ i can sit here and say we want to finish in the top eight			0
but is it realistic , is it unrealistic ? we want to finish as high up the table as we can			0
i think we ’re going to have a really good season			2
’ the best moment in his career was winning the @entity181 with @entity8 in 2011 , only for the worst moment to follow three months later with relegation to the @entity184			2
he scored 10 goals that campaign			1
‘ looking back now you ’d rather have stayed up than won the cup , ’ he admits , adding that wherever he went in the second city during that time supporters would encourage and cajole			0
‘ even close friends and family said , “ come on , any chance of winning today ? ” i ’m back in that environment			0
it ’s where i want to be			0
you ’re getting judged by the people who love you			0
it ’s a good buzz			0

@entity203 and @entity8 man will be in midfield at the @entity118
@entity1 has set a target of 10 goals for @entity126 *'s* side this season
@entity114 afforded him limited opportunities at @entity11 last year
