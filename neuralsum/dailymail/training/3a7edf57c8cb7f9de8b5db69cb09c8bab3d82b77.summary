by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 28 november 2012 in his short career , he survived being shot down from the sky three times and escaped from the @entity5 in occupied @entity6			1
now , 70 years after his death , the diary of brave @entity9 fighter pilot @entity8 has brought his remarkable escapades back to life			1
in what is thought to be the only record of its kind , the heroic @entity13 chronicles taking to the skies in the cockpits of @entity20 and @entity21 – and even describes being shot down for the first time as a ‘ most novel experience ’			2
@entity9 pilot @entity8 in the cockpit			1
he flew @entity20 and @entity21 in the @entity9 , the @entity25 over @entity6 and the @entity26 - and survived being shot down three times a page from the secret diary of @entity9 pilot @entity8			1
@entity8 kept a day - to - day record detailing his life in the skies			1
in this entry he illustrates wing formations for their next outing			0
he writes : ' we went off just before tea by ourselves and climbing up to 23,000ft over @entity37 ... i was leading yellow section and looking after the squadron 's tail ' pilots were banned from keeping diaries for security reasons , so @entity8 resorted to secretly recording his thoughts in exercise books			1
his entries display the stiff upper lip that helped our heavily outnumbered pilots win the crucial aerial battle that thwarted @entity53 ’s invasion plans			0
@entity9 pilot @entity8 with his @entity54 @entity9 pilot @entity8 with his godson @entity55 in 1940 the telegram sent by the @entity58 informing of the death of @entity9 pilot @entity8 but tragically , they end before the @entity61 secured victory			1
@entity8 was killed in action aged 22 , commanding a @entity65 squadron during the 1942 @entity66 in @entity67			1
the grave of @entity9 pilot @entity8 in @entity66 previously his squadron had played a key role in the 1940 @entity9 , and it was then that the @entity72 - educated pilot began secretly putting pen to paper			1
his first entry in september of that year begins : ‘ yesterday evening we were told we were to move to @entity77 , @entity78 , today to relieve the war - weary and much shot up @entity81			2
we grabbed beds in the hut and slept soundly , wondering what the morrow held in store			0
’ just six days later , on september 7 , @entity8 ’s plane suffered a direct hit as he duelled with a group of @entity92 @entity91 aircraft			1
but remarkably , his stricken plane landed ‘ wheels up ’ in a field near his airfield			0
of the 12 @entity99 planes in his patrol that day , one pilot died and four – including @entity8 – were injured			1
he wrote afterwards : ‘ the odds today have been unbelievable ( and we are all really very shaken ! )			2
there are bombs and things falling around tonight and a terrific gun barrage			0
has a blitz begun ? ’ after being shot down a second time on november 29 at 22,000ft he recalled : ‘ i was shot down today – a most novel experience ... ‘ as i fell out and down on my back one of my boots fell off , apparently to me falling upwards as i left it behind			2

it was one of the turning points of @entity132 and prevented @entity92 from invading @entity9			2
the battle began in mid-july with @entity134 concentrating on attacking shipping in the @entity136 and attacking coastal towns and defences			0
from 12 august , @entity139 , one of the leaders of the @entity142 regime , shifted his focus to the destruction of the @entity58 , attacking airfields and radar bases			1
( pictured above , @entity58 scrambling to their planes in 1940			1
) convinced that @entity148 was now close to defeat , he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break @entity99 strength			0
however , @entity139 grew frustrated by the large number of @entity99 planes that were still fighting off his attacks			0
@entity134 switched tactics again and , on @entity53 's orders , set about destroying @entity158 and other major cities			0
eleven days later , on what became ' @entity161 ' , the @entity58 decimated the huge incoming @entity134 formations in the skies above @entity158 and the south coast			1
he was shot down for a third time on september 20 , 1941 , after being ‘ jumped ’ by five @entity167 as he flew over @entity6 in a @entity21			1
his parents , reverend @entity169 and wife @entity170 – who lost another son , @entity124 , in the war – received a letter reporting that he was missing			0
it stated : ‘ he was very popular in the officers ’ mess and his cheerful personality will be greatly missed			0
’ remarkably , however , @entity8 had survived , and ended up in a @entity6 field			1
he turned his uniform inside out to hide the insignia that would reveal his identity , and pretended to be a farm worker as @entity5 came looking for him			1
he was helped by many @entity6 civilians and managed to escape through @entity184 over a three - month period			2
his diary entry on september 26 describes how he was given shelter by a @entity6 woman called madame @entity189			1
he wrote : ‘ i was given a very friendly welcome			0
immediately we arrived @entity189 cooked us two eggs and chips each			0
' apparently that is what the troops asked for before @entity197			0
@entity198 had quite a large number of @entity99 troops billeted there and wherever i went i was shown photos of them			0
the @entity6 liked them very much			2
’ after returning home to @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity8 was put in charge of battle - weary @entity209 and led them out to patrol the @entity66 area of @entity67 – where he was fatally shot down			1
he received a posthumous salute from @entity213 in january 1943 , when he was mentioned in despatches in @entity215			0
his parents did not discover his diary until a few years after his death			0
a version was published in the 1970s , but an extended edition has now been compiled by historians and his brother @entity117 , now 86 , a retired banking director			0
the father of four from @entity227 , @entity228 , said : ‘ we had no idea that he was writing a diary , he never mentioned it when he was on leave			0
‘ it tells of squadron life and the numerous pressures and battles which demonstrate the extraordinary dedication and self - sacrifice of all the young men in the country			0
he wrote his diary in such a straightforward way , you really feel as if you are sat next to him on the plane			2
’ the book ’s editor , @entity244 , a historian with the @entity247 @entity246 , said it was the only daily account of the @entity9 kept by a pilot of either side			2
on 10 july 1940 , @entity92 and @entity99 air forces went to war and the @entity9 began the @entity253 which @entity9 pilot @entity8 crashed during training			2
