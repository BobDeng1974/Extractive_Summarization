by @entity0 this must literally be the largest political cover up in @entity4 's history - a very dirty trick that 's dragged one council 's reputation right through the mud			2
local officials in @entity10 in east @entity4 's @entity12 province could not be bothered to wait for planning permission to build more than 20 new motorways ... so they built them anyway and covered them with earth to stop their paymasters spotting them by satellite			1
@entity21 officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments			0
but with the planning permission notoriously slow - many companies and even local government officials have been going ahead with projects anyway - hoping that the planning permission will follow by the time the building work is finished			2
corruption uncovered ! the officials could not be bothered to wait for planning permission for a prestigious new motorway and more than 20 highways , so they built them anyway in the country 's eastern @entity12 province what under @entity41 ? @entity21 officials have clamped down hard on illegal building in the country using satellite imaging to spot unauthorized developments			1
but that did n't stop these officials so when they got fed up with delays in applying for permission to build a motorway and 20 other much needed roads , they went and built them anyway - but then covered them with mud so that nobody would know - and even planted soya beans on top			1
the move meant that the illegal road did not show up on the @entity58 and @entity63 's remote sensing satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted			1
that , of course , meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight			2
do n't spill the beans ! incredibly , they even planted soya beans on top of the roads to make them look more authentic come to satellite : the move meant that the illegal road did not show up on the @entity58 and @entity63 's remote sensing satellite - and the plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted but they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government			1
@entity82 said : ' the workers turned up in may 2010 and just dug up our crops and built a road that they needed to sign a contract for to get an industrial park			0
' the road took a year to build and then they covered it with earth - but they never compensated us			0
' miracle roads : that , of course , meant that the road would appear to have been built almost overnight up in farms : but they were caught anyway when local farmers who were not compensated reported them to central government this is not the first time the stunt has been tried , as it was also used in @entity104 near @entity105 in @entity107 province , in @entity4 when another road project was also covered with mud			1
but again they were caught by local informers			0
according to @entity113 , the deputy director of @entity115 district of @entity105 , tax cuts meant many local councils had been under pressure to attract investment for example by building industrial estates			0
the road was needed to move ahead with the construction of the @entity104 industrial park , mainly processing food			0
the local government was given a hefty fine for the illegal appropriation of the farmland .			0

councillors in east @entity4 's @entity12 province applied to build 20 motorways
but when planning permission became delayed , they built them anyway
then they covered with earth and planted soya beans to hide from satellites
plan was to expose the road once the planning permission was granted
it would have meant roads miraculously appeared almost overnight
but when they *refused* to compensate local farmers , they reported them
