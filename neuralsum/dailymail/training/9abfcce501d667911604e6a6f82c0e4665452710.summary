@entity1 mp @entity0 said the benefits cap should be reduced to the value of the average £ 26,000 salary after tax - equal to just over £ 20,000 no one should be allowed to claim more than £ 20,000 a year in benefits , an influential group of @entity1 mps said yesterday			1
members of the @entity10 issued a unanimous call for the flagship welfare cap to be reduced from its current level of £ 26,000			1

@entity1 mp @entity0 said the cap should be reduced to the value of the average £ 26,000 salary after tax - equal to just over £ 20,000			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ many hard - working people in my constituency do not understand why we have a welfare cap that allows people to get £ 26,000 effectively post-tax			1
that is equal to an income of £ 35,000 pre-tax			0
‘ if we want tax cuts elsewhere we should lower the welfare cap to something more reasonable			1
for people who are fit and able to work they should be able to get no more than the equivalent of £ 26,000 post-tax			1
’ fellow @entity1 @entity39 said private polling conducted on behalf of @entity38 showed that the benefit cap was supported by about 80 per cent of the public			0
but he said 80 per cent of those backing it also thought it was too high			0
mr @entity39 said : ‘ most people think it is way too high - we should cut it to £ 20,000			2
’ the @entity10 , whose members include a number of rising @entity1 stars , was founded by education minister @entity50 and is backed by a number of other senior figures , including treasury minister @entity53 and business minister @entity54			1
the call came as the group urged @entity57 to bring forward a string of tax cuts to ease the pressure on middle class families and small businesses			1
the @entity10 also wants the starting point for paying 40 per cent tax to be raised to £ 50,000 mps said the @entity66 had gone far enough on raising the personal allowance for basic rate taxpayers and should now target measures at helping those on middle incomes			1
@entity1 mp @entity72 said : ‘ we ’ve done a good job lifting the lowest paid out of tax , but the middle classes have been hit for six			2
' proposals included scrapping stamp duty on all homes worth less than £ 500,000 , abolishing @entity78 and getting rid of so - called ‘ green taxes ’ costing almost £ 3 billion a year			2
the group also wants the starting point for paying 40 per cent tax to be raised from £ 41,450 to £ 50,000			2
the group was founded by education minister @entity50 and is backed by a number of other senior figures the proposals highlight @entity85 tensions with the @entity86 , who want to focus resources on further increases in the personal tax allowance			0
however , the group sparked controversy by calling for the introduction of a single rate of @entity94 at 15 per cent			0
@entity1 mp @entity95 , who devised the proposal , said it would lead to a fall in the price of most goods and services which currently attract @entity94 at 20 per cent			0
but he acknowledged it would also mean an increase in @entity94 on domestic fuel from eight per cent to 15 , along with the introduction of @entity94 on food and children ’s clothes , which are currently zero - rated			0

’ he said the government should have stood firm against the ‘ schoolboyish ’ campaign last year against mr @entity57 ’s bid to put @entity94 on hot pasties			0
but , speaking at the launch of a policy paper yesterday , mr @entity0 issued a warning over the plan , describing it as politically ‘ toxic ’			0
