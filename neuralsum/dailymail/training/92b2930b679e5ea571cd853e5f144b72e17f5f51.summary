almost 160,000 patients a year suffer from sores , infections and injuries caused by neglectful @entity8 care , figures show campaigners say it is ‘ scandalous ’ that hospitals are making patients even more unwell due to failings in basic care			1
for the first time , the @entity8 has released data on the numbers of patients suffering any of four conditions linked to neglect			2
they are falls , pressure sores , bladder infections and deep vein thrombosis – or blood clots – which can be avoided through good nursing care			2
between may 2012 and april 2013 , a total of 159,946 patients suffered one of these			0
last month alone there were 15,000 cases including 13,100 pressure sores , 2,470 serious falls , 2,850 urinary infections and 1,139 blood clots			0
some patients suffered more than one of the health problems			1
@entity48 , chief executive of the @entity49 , said : ‘ it is truly scandalous that patients are admitted to hospital for treatment for one condition , and then have to endure a second totally preventable issue			2
‘ this care deficit is leading to basic , but often serious and hugely painful , conditions			0
there is no excuse for poor care			0
trusts have a duty to drive down the huge numbers of these terrible experiences and be accountable where they are falling short			0
’ @entity67 , chief executive of the charity @entity68 , said that in reality about one in ten patients come to harm once other hospital blunders are included			2
‘ it ’s not a surprise to me but it ’s disappointing , ’ he added			0
hospital care and the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report into the @entity81 scandal , where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly over a ten - year period for the past 12 months @entity8 hospitals , care homes and community health services have submitted data on patients suffering falls , bed sores , blood clots or urinary infections			1
they were asked to record the percentage suffering one or more of these problems on a given day each month			0
officials will use this data – the @entity8 safety thermometer – to monitor whether hospitals and other organisations are reducing the numbers of patients coming to harm			1
hospital care and particularly the standard of nursing has been in the spotlight since a damning report in february into the @entity81 scandal			2
up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at the @entity8 trust over a ten - year period with some left crying in pain or forced to drink water from vases			1
the report warned that similar pockets of neglect existed at other hospitals and the government announced a number of changes to improve care			0
they include compulsory placements for student nurses to prove they are capable of compassion and tougher inspections of hospitals and care homes			1
doctors have warned that seriously - ill patients are being shunted out of @entity131 and left on inappropriate wards where they are not properly looked after			0
the @entity133 said a rise in admissions to hospital emergency units meant there was extra pressure on staff to move patients out quickly			0
for example , elderly people with pneumonia are being put on surgical wards – where many patients are young and otherwise fit – which tend to have fewer nurses .			1
