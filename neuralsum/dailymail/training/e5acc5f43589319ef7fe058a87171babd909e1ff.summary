by @entity0 she fell victim to a silent illness , an eating disorder which took her to the brink of death			1
@entity6 was so weak she could no longer walk , too exhausted through malnutrition			1
yet when the size eight teenager looked into the mirror all she saw was a ' fat ' person staring back - a creation of her imagination , warped by anorexia			2
now 26 , the mental health student has beaten the devastating illness , standing defiantly , a healthy size 10			1
she was so thin at one point ( left ) she could barely walk for @entity26 , the turning point came when she was admitted to hospital twice , so malnourished doctors feared she was on the brink of succumbing to the eating disorder			1
at nine years old anorexia reared its ugly head , slowly taking a hold over @entity26 's life			1
she was embarrassed to eat in front of friends and started to skip meals			1
years later , in 2007 when @entity26 left home bound for university , the illness which had lurked in the background for more than a decade took hold			1
in four months she lost three stone , leaving her only able to wear children 's clothes and struggling to walk to lectures			1
her condition was so severe doctors admitted her to hospital , concerned the illness might claim her life			2
miss @entity26 , who had to drop out of her first degree , said : ' i had covered the mirror up in my room because when i looked at myself i just saw a fat person looking back at me			0
' the mental health student , who is now a healthy size 10 , said her wake up call came when studying for her first degree , which she had to abandon , she became so weak she was unable to walk			1
she was then hospitalised twice as doctors feared she was on the brink of death ' in hospital i started on food supplement drinks to build up to eating solid foods again as i had been surviving off soup for over two months			1
' i remember having to eat my first meal which was @entity70 and i was physically shaking because i was so scared to eat it			0
' i also had to be weaned back into looking at myself in the mirror because i was so scared of the reflection i would see			0
miss @entity26 first noticed she had problems with food when she was at primary school			1
she was too embarrassed to eat her lunch in front of her class mates and when teachers told her parents they became worried and tried to make sure she ate			0
miss @entity26 said : ' i was really self - conscious eating in front of people so i stopped eating my dinner at school			1
' i started to miss breakfast and try my best to eat as little as i could for my tea			0
' when the school told my mum and dad they would literally sit and watch me eat my tea to make sure i was having it			0
when @entity6 looked in the mirror , the size eight student saw a ' fat person ' staring back , a figment of her imagination warped by her illness ' i kept the disorder at bay for a while but by high school i was counting calories again			1
' i associated confidence and popularity with being thin and even though i was already a size 8 - 10 i just thought that if i was thinner i would be more confident			1
' the now 26 - year - old , from @entity110 in @entity111 , was unable to walk to university because she was so weak , and so turned to a university counsellor for help			1
she was admitted to the eating disorder unit at @entity116 and began the gruelling process of learning to eat again			0
miss @entity26 , said : ' when i struggled to walk into university to go to a lecture i knew i needed help			2
' i was absolutely petrified because i knew it would mean having to face up to everything that i had been doing			0
it was when @entity26 moved away from home in 2007 to start her first year of university that her illness took over			1
she was eating so few calories her body muscle was wasting away leaving her unable to walk to lectures			2
' i just fell into a dark hole of self - destruction , ' she said , now in her third year at the @entity133 studying mental health			0
' when my mum and dad would come and visit me they would do a food shop for me and i would just throw it out once they had left			2
' i became really isolated because i would avoid going anywhere or be around anyone who was eating food			2
' if the students in my dorm were cooking i would just shut myself in my room because the thought of the food they were eating would just repulse me			2
' at 19 , miss @entity26 was dressing in children ’s clothes and her destructive food routine became so bad her body was unable to keep itself warm			2
her body started to sprout @entity156 hair , a soft , fine white hair that grows mainly on the arms and chest of anorexic sufferers approaching emaciation , to try and insulate itself			0
she said : ' i was constantly freezing and my lips would actually turn blue			0
' i ’d also have bruises all over my body because my body was so weak and i would faint quite a lot			0
' my thoughts were n’t my own anymore and were just taken over by the constant battle to lose weight			0
' miss @entity26 was in hospital for nine months and was readmitted a year later after falling back into her old eating habits			2
she managed to put two stone back on in hospital and has since gained more weight , determined not to slip back into her destructive routine			0
but after two stays in hospital the now 26 - year - old has beaten the illness , and enjoys indulging in a range of different foods , especially an @entity183 takeaway she said : ' i am no longer scared of food and actually enjoy eating it , especially a good @entity183 meal			1
' i still have some body image issues but i have a good friend and family network around me and my confidence has grown a lot			0
' @entity192 is such a secretive illness so the best thing you can do is talk to someone and reach out for help sooner rather than later			0
' anorexia is a compulsive mental illness which makes the sufferer obsessed with losing weight or staying thin			2
often sufferers have a distorted view of their body and think they ’re heavier than they are causing physical , psychological and behavioural symptoms			0
