by @entity0 when you spend your days running up and down trees and hunting for nuts , it is important that you get your stretches done properly			1
this squirrel appears to have taken the advice to heart as it was caught ' doing yoga ' in a park in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the ginger climber can be seen stretching high towards the sky - and even practicing some ' anti-gravity yoga ' from a tree trunk			1
going nuts : the adorable squirrel stretches out on a tree trunk during a snack break in @entity12 , @entity13 reaching for the stars : the energetic little rodent made sure he got his sun salutation right stretch and pull : the squirrel has come up with his own version of anti-gravity yoga , preferring to dig his claws into a tree rather than hang from the ceiling in a hammock photographer @entity34 , who captured the image in his home city of @entity12 , @entity13 , said : ‘ it 's uncommon			1
’ the red squirrel also demonstrated its acrobatic skills leaping between trees , and attempted to grab a woman 's handbag as she walked through the park			1
but it later came over all shy , burying its head in its hands and tucking it towards its chest as it sat on a tree branch			2
@entity34 said locals often visit @entity52 to feed the squirrels			2
yoga - t to be kidding me : you might think this is just the squirrel curling up into a ball - but as a matter for fact , he is prepping for his cat pose drop it like its hot : there is no stopping the squirrel now , as he heads down the tree trunk in full speed dinner time : after all that exercise , the squirrel has a well - deserved nut he added : ‘ for many years i have developed a passion about squirrels , especially the red squirrel of @entity77			1
‘ fortunately , i have had the chance and the opportunity to observe them not very far from my place			2
‘ i am not the only one to know about this special place			0

‘ everytime i go there i ask these people what they know about squirrels and i get to hear many interesting stories and legends			0
