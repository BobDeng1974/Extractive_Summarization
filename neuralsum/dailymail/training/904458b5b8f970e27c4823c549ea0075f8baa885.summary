an experimental surgery that implants an electronic device into the brain of people that are profoundly deaf to stimulate an awareness of sound has allowed a little boy in @entity8 to hear things for the time			1
and watching the moment that three - year - old @entity12 responds to music for the first time is sure to melt your heart			1
the @entity18 toddler was born deaf but only properly diagnosed at 18 - months - old			1
doctors initially gave him bilateral cochlear implants , but following the surgery and six months of therapy , @entity12 did not respond whatsoever , according to @entity24			1
the video showed @entity35 toddler @entity48 hearing his father 's voice for the first time			2
the surgery , an auditory brainstem implant ( @entity41 ) , has only been performed about 1,000 times			0
@entity31 began researching and believed her son was an ideal candidate			0
she tracked down the team of doctors in @entity58 who performed the operation			0
after a successful six - hour bran surgery in @entity61 in may , @entity12 has slowly been introduced to some sounds			1
but his biggest breakthrough to date was at a recent family gathering when he began - much to the marvel of his parents - to react to music			2
priceless : this is the moment @entity12 reacts to music , which he is able to hear for the first time ' more , more ' : the three - year - old , who is learning to sign , does the symbol for ' again ' when the song comes on dance time : @entity12 jumps to his feet as the song , @entity76 by @entity77 , comes through the stereo as the song , @entity76 by @entity77 , comes through the stereo , the look on @entity12 's face is priceless			1
he immediately jumps up and begins to dance			0
' it was an amazing moment ... i have shivers just thinking of that moment , ' mrs @entity31 told @entity24			0
' and we 're really hoping that we 'll get more with time			0
' @entity12 's hearing will hopefully improve with time , however he will always be dead			2
his doctors in @entity61 will continue to turn up the volume of his implant hoping that sounds will become clearer for him			2
