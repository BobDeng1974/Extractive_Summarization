@entity0 has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if a federal investigation had never found him out			1
the disgraced cyclist , who used performance - enhancing drugs to cheat his way to a record seven successive @entity7 titles after recovering from cancer , said that his lies would still be spiralling if the truth had not been uncovered two years ago			1
he told @entity11 in a phone interview : ' once you say " no " you have to keep saying " no "			2
if this stuff had n’t taken place with the federal investigation , i ’d probably still be saying " no " with the same conviction and tone as before			1
but that gig is up			2
but there was a lot of stuff in that lie , not simply me saying , " no "			2
i could n’t change the story			2
' @entity0 is serving a lifetime ban from sport , and said he is surprised at how he is able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did			1
' i never get crap , not once , and i 'm surprised by that , ' he said			2
' sure , i sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it 's never happened			0
' a cancer survivor and once hero to millions , @entity0 was stripped of his seven @entity7 victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the @entity45 after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sporting history			1
toughing it up : he admits to having an ' f - you ' attitude , but the disgraced cyclist insists he ' never gets crap ' from people following his long - awaited admission of long - term doping the investigation and later admission to doping destroyed @entity0 's reputation and career			1
he admitted that he has to accept that he has lost all credibility from the revelations			0
' i do n’t blame anyone for thinking , " i do n’t trust this guy with all his bulls * * * for ten years " , ' he said			1
however , he still feels harshly done by in his punishments when compared with other riders who have also been caught doping			1
' i think most people are smart enough to say : " that does n’t make any sense " , ' he said			2
' what stands out in a lot of people ’s minds is that we all know what happened in those other years , but those [ results ] still stand			2
' @entity0 and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain his huge fortune			1
bleak outlook : there 's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in june a federal judge rejected @entity0 's bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team , which the @entity94 had sponsored , defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned , performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity0 claims the @entity94 benefited hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late			1
the lawsuit has potential $ 100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world 's wealthiest sports stars			0
' i 'm very confident that that`s a winner for us , ' said @entity0			1
' i do n't think anyone can truly argue the @entity94 was damaged			0
' they made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for			0
' i worked my ass off for them and i 'm proud of it			0
furthermore there was n't a technical relationship between myself and the @entity94			0
' reboot : @entity0 hopes to restart his charity work , undergo a course of therapy and says he is planning on writing a book where he will ' put it all out there ' @entity0 has said he now plans to write another book , which unlike his last effort , ' it 's @entity132 ' , will be totally honest			1
' i need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw			1
i need to put it out there and let it sit			0
it has to be the right book , the right tone and there has to be totally no b - s , ' he said			2
he added that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years , and that he is ' fully committed to putting it all out there			0
' asked about seeking actual therapy , the 42 - year - old said : ' my therapy is riding my bike , playing golf and having a beer			0
i have n’t gotten around to it			0
i get it totally , but it ’s not something that ’s taken place yet			0
' @entity0 relishes a good fight , and claims it is this spirit that made him the cyclist he was			1
' i definitely have an ' f - you ' attitude , ' he said			0
' i fight in training , i fight to win races , i fight to motivate the guys in the team			0
' the list of those he hurt , and who wo n't forgive him , is long : three - time @entity7 winner @entity173 , journalist @entity174 , who spent more than a decade trying to expose @entity0 , and former friends @entity176 and @entity177 , are just a few			1
a number have asked whether his public mea culpa on @entity180 was genuine and if he needs to do more			0
' that 's a difficult one for me to answer , ' he said			0
' you ca n't do justice in a one - hour conversation			0
it was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information , but for other people - cycling fans , sports fans , for other parts of the population - it was n't enough , i did n't go far enough			2
