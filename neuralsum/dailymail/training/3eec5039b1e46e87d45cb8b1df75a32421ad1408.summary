by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor @entity3 shook hands with @entity6 president @entity5 today , an unprecedented gesture of friendship which occurred , fittingly , at the memorial service for @entity10 – but left the @entity2 president facing backlash that he had warmly greeted a ' murderer '			1

but members of the @entity25 were upset on tuesday , led by @entity27 @entity26 senator @entity26 , a @entity27 @entity28 and son of @entity6 immigrants			1
' if the president was going to shake his hand , @entity26 told @entity33 , ' he should have asked him about those basic freedoms @entity10 was associated with that are denied in @entity6			1
' @entity26 has been an outspoken critic of the @entity5 regime which he said earlier this year ' sponsors terrorism abroad and against their own people			2
' ' it is nauseating , @entity27 @entity28 congresswoman @entity40 told @entity42			1
' i was born in @entity6 , had to leave the homeland because of oppression ... he shook the hand of a murderer , of a thug			1
and those are bloodied hands			2
' if it 's just a handshake that 's not going to produce any change , i think @entity5 should have listened to what @entity3 said ' about human rights , she insisted			1

but @entity40 , who represents thousands of @entity6 refugees who are now @entity2 citizens , was so upset that she laid into secretary of state @entity89 during an unrelated hearing about @entity91			1
' when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like @entity5 , it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant , ' she lectured him before the @entity99			1
' @entity5 uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail democracy advocates			2
in fact , right now as we speak @entity6 opposition leaders are being detained and they 're being beaten while trying to commemorate today , which is @entity107			2
' @entity89 deflected the criticism			0
' today is about honoring @entity10			0

the @entity6 government hailed it as a hopeful sign , writing on its website : ' may this ... be the beginning of the end of the @entity2 aggressions			1
' @entity3 later used his eulogy to @entity10 , a man he considers a personal hero , to address dictators of the world who pay lip service to @entity10 's legacy while repressing their own people			1
he said : ' there are too many of us who happily embrace @entity10 's legacy of racial reconciliation , but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality			1
' there are too many leaders who claim solidarity with @entity10 's struggle for freedom , but do not tolerate dissent from their own people			1
and there are too many of us who stand on the sidelines , comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard			0
' a group of @entity2 lawmakers visited with @entity5 in february , in a failed bid to secure the release of @entity2 government contractor @entity177 , who has been imprisoned there since december 2009			2

president @entity3 greets the crowd who stood for hours in torrential rain to say goodbye to their beloved @entity10 @entity3 opened his speech by thanking @entity10 's family , then continued : ' to the people of @entity22 - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing @entity10 with us			1
' your dignity and hope found expression in his life , and your freedom , your democracy is his cherished legacy			0
' @entity10 taught us the power of action , but also ideas ; the importance of reason and arguments ; the need to study not only those you agree with , but those who you do n't			0
' referring to the anti-apartheid icon 's friendship with his own prison warders , the president said : ' it took a man like @entity10 to free not just the prisoner , but the gaoler as well			2
' to the people of @entity22 - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing @entity10 with us			1
his struggle was your struggle			0
his triumph was your triumph			0
born during @entity307 , far from the corridors of power , a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by elders of his @entity312 tribe - @entity10 would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century			0
he was not a bust made of marble ; he was a man of flesh and blood - a son and husband , a father and a friend			0
@entity10 showed us the power of action ; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals			0
@entity10 understood the ties that bind the human spirit			0
there is a word in @entity22 - ' @entity329 ' - that describes his greatest gift : his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye ; that there is a oneness to humanity ; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others , and caring for those around us			0
it took a man like @entity10 to free not just the prisoner , but the gaoler as well ; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you ; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past , but a means of confronting it with inclusion , generosity and truth			0
he changed laws , but also hearts			0
there are too many of us who happily embrace @entity10 ’s legacy of racial reconciliation , but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality			0
there are too many leaders who claim solidarity with @entity10 ’s struggle for freedom , but do not tolerate dissent from their own people			0
and there are too many of us who stand on the sidelines , comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard			0
we will never see the likes of @entity10 again			0
but let me say to the young people of @entity22 , and young people around the world - you can make his life ’s work your own			2
over thirty years ago , while still a student , i learned of @entity10 and the struggles in this land			0
it stirred something in me			0
it woke me up to my responsibilities - to others , and to myself - and set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today			0
and while i will always fall short of @entity10 ’s example , he makes me want to be better .			0
