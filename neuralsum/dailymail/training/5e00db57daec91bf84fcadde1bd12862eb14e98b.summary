mad : @entity0 points a gun - and has threatened to point his missiles at the @entity3 the nail - biting diplomatic tension over @entity6 ’s nuclear threats increased last night after despot @entity0 targeted long - range missiles at @entity8 , @entity3 ’s military foothold in the region			1
the rogue state ’s president ordered two @entity14 rockets and launchers – each capable of delivering one - ton warheads – to be set up in the east of his country , within possible striking range of @entity8			1
experts are divided on the range and accuracy of the untested @entity14 rocket – and whether @entity6 has the ability to fit it with a nuclear warhead – but the aggressive moves have spooked the @entity3 into further bolstering the defences of the @entity29 island			1
the @entity3 stronghold in the tropics – its westernmost territory set in deep ocean between the @entity34 and @entity35 – is among a list of targets announced by the @entity6 leader that also includes @entity40 , @entity41 and even the @entity42			1
but @entity8 islanders defiantly laughed off the idea of a @entity6 attack from 2,100 miles away – and insisted it is nothing but a phoney war			1
‘ my message to @entity6 is , “ you just try it			1
we will annihilate you ” , ’ said bar manager @entity48 as she mixed drinks beneath portraits of princess @entity51 and @entity52 in the @entity54 pub , a favourite haunt for @entity3 servicemen			1
‘ @entity0 is just a little dictator trying to show that he ’s a big man but there ’s no way in the world that we ’re going to be frightened of him			0
‘ people in mainland @entity3 might get worked up about this but regulars here do n’t even talk about it that much			1
they ’re more interested in the finals of the @entity3 national basketball tournament than @entity6			1
’ @entity48 added : ‘ if there was a conflict and it went nuclear , it would be ugly , of course			0
but it would be @entity6 that would be destroyed			1
’ at 3pm yesterday , on the frontline of a conflict some experts believe might yet explode into the @entity80 , young couples strolled and children played in the white sand and surf of a palm - fringed tropical beach			0
relax : despite @entity6 nuclear threats , holidaymakers in @entity8 , @entity3 , sit in the sun on @entity88 yesterday response : a @entity3 @entity92 @entity91 stealth jet fighter like the ones based in @entity94 at the @entity95 away from the heat of the seafront , holidaymakers ambled lazily through five - star hotel lobbies and an air - conditioned shopping arcade full of designer shops including @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104			1
a few streets further back , the @entity54 was doing a roaring trade in b52 cocktails as regulars cracked jokes and chortled at the idea that their afternoon session might be interrupted by a missile strike			2
with its beaches and hotels packed yesterday , people in @entity8 – population 180,000 and catchphrase ‘ where @entity3 ’s day begins ’ – seemed determined to shrug off the @entity6 menace and carry on with life as usual			1
the only unusual sight was on the seafront – thronging with @entity123 and @entity3 tourists – where a row of first aid tents had been erected			1
it transpired they had not been put up to treat casualties of incoming missiles , but athletes injured in the inaugural @entity131 taking place today			0
military base : a @entity3 c - 130 aircraft based in @entity8 where a defence system will be installed to shoot down incoming missiles and warheads amid threats from @entity6 in a sign of how the growing crisis has failed to disrupt island life , 2,000 athletes , including many @entity3 servicemen , will race to a finishing line a few miles from @entity145 where @entity147 and @entity148 bombers – along with the rest of a huge @entity3 arsenal – are based			1
‘ this @entity6 business is total nonsense , ’ the manager of one five - star hotel in @entity8 ’s premier resort of @entity88 told me			1
‘ our hotel is nearly full and not one person has cancelled since this crisis began			0
‘ they could n’t possibly hit us from there and anything they tried to launch would be taken out of the sky at the push of a button			0
’ despite the bravado , there is an underlying concern over the threats from @entity6			2
@entity8 governor @entity170 said on friday that all @entity0 needed was ‘ one lucky shot ’ to cause ‘ a lot of damage to our island home ’			2
@entity3 has ordered an air defence system called @entity177 ( @entity177 ) for @entity8 – but it will not arrive for weeks and some islanders fear it may come too late if @entity0 orders a strike			1
threats : @entity0 , pictured here on a @entity6 army ship , has repeatedly threatened to attack the @entity3 ‘ every day there seems to be a new threat from @entity6 and something new for us to worry about , ’ said a curator at a museum on the island dedicated to the @entity29 wars			1
‘ it really is scary , whatever people might tell you			0
‘ we were supposed to have 8,000 @entity194 sent to @entity8 from @entity41 two years ago but they have n’t arrived because of budget cuts			2
’ however , in the winding roads leading to the heavily - guarded @entity203 base , the mood among indigenous islanders who work there and whose families are supported by the army was more positive and defiant			0
speaking outside his home near the base , engineer @entity204 said : ‘ i ’m not worried about an attack			0
i know the @entity3 defences would knock out anything @entity6 put up into the sky without even having to send a plane up			1
there is no sense of crisis			0
we think it ’s all just talk			0
’ foreigners at risk : @entity6 official checks the passports of a group of foreign diplomats and tourists as they board a flight			2
all foreigners in the country have been warned to get out back in bustling @entity88 , long - term expatriate @entity226 shared the engineer ’s confidence			0
‘ people living in @entity8 are n’t nearly as wound up about this as people abroad			1
i had a call from my brother in @entity234 last night			0
he said the tv was saying we were on standby for an invasion			0
i told him we ’d get our pool cues and golf clubs and fight them on the beaches when they landed			0
’ mr @entity226 , who comes from @entity241 where @entity0 went to high school , said he was baffled that the dictator appeared to have turned out to be such an unhinged figure			0
threat : a large number @entity3 military bases in the @entity29 are within range of the new missiles - shown here @entity251 technology : a map from the @entity253 and the @entity254 shows that @entity6 's missiles can not even reach @entity256 about 3,100 miles away ‘ @entity241 is a reasonably democratic country and our schools are good			1
how can he now behave in such a crazy and illogical way ? ‘ but i guess the truth is it is n’t him – it ’s the generals who are controlling this			0
‘ we are n’t worried though			0
why should we be ? we know the firepower we have on the @entity3 bases here in @entity8			1
i truly believe we are living in the safest place on earth			0
’ analysis by @entity270 , @entity271 @entity6 ’s threats are aimed at fostering a sense of crisis with the outside world – and creating a siege - mentality to unify its population squarely behind its inexperienced 30 - year - old leader , @entity0			2
since he took over from his father , @entity281 , in december 2011 , there has been a campaign to present him as a near - omniscient national saviour and military genius with statues , slogans and photographs of him with his frontline troops			0
provoking and sustaining a crisis is also a chance for the @entity6 to justify its decision to reopen its plutonium and uranium - based facilities at @entity294 – which it hopes may be used to help expand its nuclear arsenal of weapons of mass destruction			2
missile threat : a @entity6 military vehicle carries a missile through @entity301			1
the pariah state have repeatedly threatened to attack the @entity3 and @entity40 but @entity301 also has a broader international objective			1
it wants to express its irritation and opposition to new , tougher sanctions introduced after its nuclear test in february			0
it is objecting , too , to the joint @entity3 - @entity40 military exercises taking place on and around the peninsula since march and which will continue until april 20			2
above all , it wants to have direct talks with the @entity3 to enhance its status as a legitimate , independent sovereign state , while prising open the door to further concessions from the @entity319			2
however , @entity3 president @entity320 wants @entity6 to abandon its nuclear programme before he is willing to embark on such talks			1
yet as the crisis intensifies it is unclear how long the @entity3 can maintain this conditional approach			2
the @entity326 has been trying to drive a wedge between @entity328 and @entity329 and last week @entity6 diplomats in @entity331 reportedly indicated they were prepared to begin dialogue with the new conservative administration of @entity334 in @entity329			2
such discussions would be an opportunity , according to the @entity6 , to reactivate a long - term commitment to promoting unification			2
@entity329 ’s susceptibility to such talks is potentially a point of difference between presidents @entity320 and @entity342			0
danger : the @entity6 leader has repeatedly ramped up the rhetoric in recent weeks threatening a military strike for now , the principal source of concern is the danger of a war occurring through miscalculation or misperception			1
as the @entity3 moves more of its high - profile strategic assets into the region , there is a risk the @entity6 will see these as @entity328 planning to attack the @entity6 pre-emptively in the future			1
there is also a danger that @entity0 will order ever more high - profile provocations that could , in turn , be misread by @entity40 and the @entity3 as the first step in a more aggressive approach			2
@entity301 has a track record of provoking the international community to try to extort political and economic concessions			0
in two attacks against @entity40 in 2010 , it shelled an island and appeared to deliberately sink a naval vessel , killing 46 sailors			0
so often in the @entity374 it was luck rather than rational calculation that prevented conflicts escalating beyond control : national leaders are often poorly equipped to cope with the unexpected when it comes to nuclear weapons			0
it is worth @entity320 keeping this in mind in dealing with @entity6			2
maintaining deterrence is critically important			0
but it may be prudent to combine this with a more imaginative attitude in negotiations to lower the risks in this most volatile of regions .			0

@entity3 are sending a missile defence system to @entity8 but it will be weeks before it arrives
180,000 people live in @entity8 which @entity6 has threatened to attack
