a father - of - two who brushed his ankle against a bin bag , scraping the skin , developed a flesh - eating bug and nearly lost his leg			1
@entity6 was cleaning up after a children 's picnic when he bumped his leg against a bin bag			1
though the 47 - year - old barely registered it at the time , the scrape almost cost him his right leg			1
a cut so small it was hardly visible , became infected , causing the rare condition necrotizing faciitis - a flesh - eating bug			1
so extreme was mr @entity6 's infection , surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg			1
but as they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the procedure , the antibiotics mr @entity6 had been given finally began to show signs of working			1
@entity6 , 47 , from @entity26 , @entity27 , pictured with his daughters @entity28 and @entity30 , nearly lost his right leg after scraping it against a bin bag while clearing up after a party ' i attended a picnic for my daughter 's kindergarten class , ' said mr @entity37 , @entity27			1
' the kids played and it was a wonderful day			2
after the party ended , i helped in the clean up			1
' i filled a bag with trash and , as it neared filling , spun the bag so i could tie it off			2
' the bag 's bottom corner brushed – and we 're talking barely touched – my ankle and left a little teensie bit of juice on my sock			1
' there was no abrasion or anything visible			2
' that evening , mr @entity6 , who owns a summer camp company , was at home watching a movie with his daughters @entity28 , now 13 and @entity30 , now 11 , when he began to feel feverish			1
' my leg , foot and ankle began to swell and a nasty dark purple began to spread and grow			1
my temperature was rising , i started feeling awful , ' he said			2
' i thought it was a spider bite			0
i made my kids look but they did n't see anything			0
' by the following evening , his temperature had rocketed to 42 ° c and he could put weight on his ankle			0
he rushed to @entity70 and collapsed at the intake desk			0
mr @entity6 was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and medics battled to save him from the grips of infection			1
' for the next few days , i was incoherent , feverish – completely out of it , ' he said			0
' the infection spread and my temperature did not go down			0
i was in deep , deep trouble			0
a cut so small it was barely visible became infected , triggering the flesh - eating infection , necrotizing faciitis surgeons were preparing to amputate his right leg , when they noticed antibiotics given to the father - of - two had begun to work			1
as a result his leg was saved ' they did n't tell me how bad it was but apparently told my mum , who flew in and stayed at my bedside , to get my paperwork in order as they might not save me			2
' as the infection took hold , mr @entity6 began to suffer ' crazy fever dreams ' , telling his mother he was due to fly via private plane to @entity105 to attend a party hosted by @entity107 and @entity108			1
despite being hooked up to several iv drips and plied with different combinations of antibiotics , mr @entity6 's fever refused to slow			1
when red infection lines began to shoot over his knee , surgeons decided to prep him for amputation			1
it was not until they were printing out the paperwork to authorise the operation that the medicine finally began to work			1
eventually , the infection was beaten and mr @entity6 was moved to a regular hospital room to recover			1
' at first they put me in a shared room and it was really only then that i began to get coherent			2
' there was a guy in the bed nearby and his wife sitting at the foot of the bed , ' mr @entity6 said			1
' they were both staring at me			0
i looked down at my massive , swollen , disgusting leg with flesh literally falling away , hair a mess , soaked in sweat – not the person you want to be wheeled into your room			2
' once i moved into a single room and washed up , i began to feel more human			2
' my sister stayed in my room day and night and , while wearing gloves , peeled away layer after layer of dead , disgusting tissue			0
' mr @entity6 said he is grateful to be alive			1
his foot has now completely healed but still hurts a lot of the time mr @entity6 was discharged and given crutches , which he found difficult to navigate			1
on his first day back home , he slipped , broke his hip and was sent back to hospital for a string of orthopaedic surgeries which ended in a total hip replacement			0
his lymph system was severely damaged following the infection and his foot is now covered in scar tissue			0
he is keen to raise awareness of his ordeal , working tirelessly with the @entity162			0
' when i look at the pictures i have a hard time believing that it 's me and i survived , ' he said			0
' the doctors think that a teensie abrasion from the trash bag and the presence of the bacteria on the bag was enough to let in the infection			2
the bacteria is present all over the world			0
' my foot has healed completely mottled and hurts much of the time but i get used to it			0
' it 's good to be alive			0
' necrotizing faciitis is often triggered by group a streptococci bacteria , pictured necrotizing faciitis is a rare but life - threatening infection affecting the deep layers of the skin			1
it progresses quickly after being triggered by various types of bacteria , including group a streptococcus and staphylococcus			0
many infections are caused by organisms already residing on a person 's skin			0
@entity193 streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin			0
the vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses , such as strep throat and impetigo			0
occasionally , however , the bacteria can become life - threatening if entering parts of the body where not usually found such as the blood , muscles or the lungs			2
the bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores			2
invasive group a streptococcal disease , which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body ’s defences , is a severe and sometimes life - threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body , such as the blood , deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs			2
two of the most severe forms of invasive group a streptococcal disease are necrotising fasciitis and @entity232 ( a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs )			0
the early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever , severe pain and swelling , and redness at the wound site			0
the early symptoms of @entity232 may include fever , dizziness , confusion , low blood pressure , rash and abdominal pain .			0
