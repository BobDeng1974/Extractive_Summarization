by @entity0 the family of a young mother who fled to @entity3 to stop social services taking her baby demanded an apology yesterday after health workers confirmed the girl was thriving under her care			1
@entity10 , who has mild learning difficulties , was told she would have to hand over her child because of concerns over its emotional development			1
instead , she moved to @entity16 where she gave birth to her daughter , @entity18			1
relief : @entity10 , 24 , from @entity20 has won the right to keep her daughter @entity18 after a two - year battle with @entity23 happy little girl : miss @entity10 gave birth to @entity18 , now two , abroad after she and her mother fled to @entity3 for fear social workers would take the child she returned only after her parents were granted a court order allowing them to share her parental responsibilities – meaning she was certain she could keep her baby			1
now @entity33 , 24 , wants to highlight what she says are the dangers posed by social workers who wield the power to tear families apart			2
‘ i have proven the social workers wrong , ’ she said			0
‘ they made the wrong decision			0
’ her father @entity42 , a 47 - year - old businessman , said : ‘ we have just had @entity18 ’s two - year check and a health worker said she was well advanced and interacting with everyone perfectly			2
they were absolutely over the moon with her			0
‘ that made me think that social services had made a mistake and had n’t apologised			0
unsettling start : miss @entity10 pictured with her days old daughter and parents @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity16 , @entity3 in april 2010 ‘ they have n’t apologised to my wife , who lost three stone when she went to @entity3 with @entity10 , or to my daughter for what they put her through			1
‘ they made her feel like dirt and she was talking about taking her own life if they took her daughter away			2
’ miss @entity10 , who was diagnosed with learning difficulties as a child , became pregnant in 2009			1
@entity20 social services carried out an assessment which flagged up concerns about her low iq and inability to show emotion , which it said meant she could not look after a baby			0
child protection officers also claimed @entity18 ’s father – from whom @entity33 had separated – had a bad record with social services , but refused to give further details			2
miss @entity10 ’s father and mother @entity56 , 45 , offered themselves as potential foster parents but realised staff did not favour their application after a report criticised the fact mr @entity33 had smacked his three children to discipline them			1
proud grandparents : in january 2011 @entity56 and @entity92 were granted a residence order meaning they could share parental responsibilities of @entity18 with their daughter happy family : miss @entity10 said she would tell other mothers in her situation that they have to believe in themselves and know they are a good mother in february 2010 , @entity33 and her mother drove to @entity3 , where she gave birth a week later			1
the family spent £ 12,000 on accommodation and other costs until they were assured mother and child would not be separated			1
backing : @entity110 mp and chairman of @entity112 , @entity113 , claimed social workers are removing children from families for ' spurious reasons ' a five - minute court hearing in january last year confirmed a ‘ residence order ’ , meaning miss @entity10 would live with her parents in @entity120 , near @entity121 , and @entity18 could be taken off the at - risk register			1
mr @entity33 , who owns three companies involved with the construction , container and motor industries , said : ‘ when @entity10 came back from @entity3 an independent team of social workers were assigned to her			1
‘ they eventually apologised for interfering in our lives and said there was never any need for them to be involved			0
‘ i have phoned the council nine times to discuss the case and get an apology but they will not have a meeting with me			2
’ his daughter added : ‘ i would tell other mothers in the same situation to keep fighting			0
you have to believe in yourself and know that you are a good mother			0
’ @entity146 mp @entity113 , the chairman of campaign group @entity147 , accused social workers of removing children from families for ‘ spurious reasons ’ and said experts used in family courts were ‘ unreliable ’			1
he added : ‘ they remove babies from people who are never given the chance to prove they are good parents – and even when there are good grandparents around			0
the government should stop being complacent and take action			0
’ @entity23 said it was ‘ delighted that everything has continued to go well ’ for the family			2
a spokesman said : ‘ when concerns about the wellbeing of a child are brought to the attention of children ’s services , we have a duty to investigate			0
‘ over the past two years , childcare professionals have had a very positive working relationship with the family			0
’ asked about apologising for the @entity177 ’ treatment , they added : ‘ we are more than happy to speak with the family when they feel the need to contact us			0
