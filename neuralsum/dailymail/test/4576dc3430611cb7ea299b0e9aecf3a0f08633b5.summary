as seasons go , this one has been pretty close to perfect for @entity2			1
runaway leaders in @entity5 , they became the first team in the @entity7 to mathematically secure promotion on tuesday night - and in sensational style			1
hitting @entity10 for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line , although given their free - wheeling and free - scoring form the result really came as little surprise			2
@entity17 celebrates with a bottle of @entity5 champagne following @entity2 's promotion city players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from @entity5 and there ’s more			1
add to that their memorable @entity25 victory at @entity26 last month - when @entity27 were comfortably beaten 2 - 0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for @entity31 ’s team			1
the season has been a personal triumph for tall , tattooed defender @entity17 , who has played a central role in returning @entity2 to the @entity35 after two seasons away			1
his uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set - pieces , leading to 11 goals this season			1
@entity17 was on target at @entity26 , fulfilling a childhood dream in the process , and also at @entity46 on tuesday			1
the @entity48 stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against @entity10 on tuesday @entity55 scores his side 's fourth goal of the game as @entity2 earn an impressive 6 - 0 at @entity46 ‘ when the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season , we had three aims , ’ he tells @entity56			1
‘ the first was to win promotion back to the @entity35 , the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the @entity25			0
‘ we 've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on saturday we can achieve the other			0
’ that ’s because @entity2 need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions			1
the 25 - year - old defender celebrates as the @entity48 earned promotion to the @entity35 in style city manager @entity31 celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne they currently lead @entity80 by 10 points but the @entity83 side have a game in hand and so three points are required against @entity87 at @entity88 this weekend			1
‘ nobody wants that runners - up medal			0
the aim was always to go up as champions and we ’re close to achieving that , ’ @entity17 says			2
‘ we ’ve had that winning habit and it ’s a good one to get in to			0
we ’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing			2
’ @entity101 does one team dominate a division in this way			0
the lowest @entity2 have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture			2
the @entity48 have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the @entity25 once again , @entity55 ( right ) made a huge contribution , giving @entity2 the lead against @entity27 on march 22 @entity55 wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory @entity31 ( left ) and @entity116 look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at @entity26 they kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn			1
since september 13th , there has only been one week when they have n’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the @entity129			0
not that success has been reserved for the league			0
they reached the fourth round of the @entity134 , losing narrowly to @entity136 @entity135 , and claimed the @entity25 too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at @entity26			0
@entity17 said : ‘ i think any player dreams of scoring and winning at @entity26			2
there really is n't a better feeling in football			0
it is right up there with the highlights in my career but i would say that if we win on saturday and go up as champions , that will push @entity26 out			0
’ the defender ’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he ’s quick to credit his team - mates for the service : ‘ i did n't expect to score as many as five to be honest ! @entity55 holds the jpt with pride as he celebrates the 2 - 0 victory against @entity27 last month the defender was also named the @entity159 for march ‘ i 've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set - pieces that have been delivered by the lads			1
‘ @entity165 has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season			1
@entity170 and @entity171 have been providing plenty of assists , not just for me but for everyone			0
‘ but everyone has chipped in , it has been a collective effort			0
the team spirit here has been the best i 've ever experienced and it 's been an enjoyable season			2
’ promotion back to the @entity35 could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club ’s 118 - year history			1
@entity165 ( right ) has scored 18 domestic goals for the high - flying @entity48 this season billionaire owner @entity186 ( left ) is funding a renovation of the club ’s @entity88 home billionaire owner @entity186 , who made his fortune in financial services , is funding a renovation of the club ’s @entity88 home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it @entity136 - ready			1
and , according to @entity17 , that ’s precisely where the club is aiming : ‘ we aim high and should be in the @entity35 , if not higher than that			2
‘ it 's a massive city , i did n't realise how big it is until i moved here			0
it 's surprising that the place has n't got a @entity136 team and maybe we can change that			0
‘ the chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that			0
seeing @entity209 and @entity210 doing so well in the @entity35 , nobody expected that and , who knows what will happen when we get there next season			0
