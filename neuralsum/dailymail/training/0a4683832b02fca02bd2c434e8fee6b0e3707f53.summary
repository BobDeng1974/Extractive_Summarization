facing ban ? @entity2 co-founder @entity1 may be refused re-entry into the @entity4 after migrating to @entity5 to cut his tax bill @entity2 co-founder @entity1 may not be allowed to return to the @entity4 after he renounced his citizenship to save millions in tax			1
the 30 - year - old , who has a $ 3.64billion stake in the social networking site , migrated to @entity5 ahead of the company 's massive stock market floatation tomorrow			1
the timing of the move has raised eyebrows since @entity5 does not have a capital gains tax , which could vastly reduce his bill on any payout			1
according to an immigration law , he could be refused re-entry to the @entity4 if he is judged to have relocated for the purposes of avoiding taxes			0
section 212 of the law , highlighted by @entity28 , states : ' any alien who is a former citizen of the @entity4 who officially renounces @entity4 citizenship and who is determined by the attorney general to have renounced @entity4 citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the @entity4 is excludable			2
' a link was also posted on @entity28 to a document that someone would need to file with the @entity42 's @entity41 when renouncing citizenship			0
the document says : ' my renunciation / relinquishment may not exempt me from @entity4 income taxation ... i understand that if my renunciation of @entity4 citizenship is determined by the united states attorney general to be motivated by tax avoidance purposes , i will be found excludable from the @entity4 under @entity51 , as amended			1
' earlier this week , it emerged that @entity1 had moved to @entity53 at the age of 13 because he was at risk of kidnapping			2
the 30 - year - old was on a gangster 's list of potential kidnap targets which led his wealthy parents to flee @entity62 in a potentially lifesaving move			1
but now he has shunned the country in which he made his fortune through the social networking site			2
@entity68 lifestyle : @entity1 ( far right ) enjoys a rooftop party with friends and models in his new home of @entity5			1
he may not be allowed to return to @entity4 if his move was judged to be down to tax avoidance he moved to the @entity4 in 1992 and became a citizen in 1998 , his spokesman @entity75 said			1
' @entity1 recently found it more practical to become a resident of @entity5 since he plans to live there for an indefinite period of time , ' @entity75 told @entity81			1
his name falls on an @entity84 list of people renouncing their citizenship from april 30 - but his spokesman said @entity1 gave up his @entity4 citizenship last september			1
the 30 - year - old joins a growing number of people giving up their @entity4 citizenship in a move that can trim their tax liabilities in the country			1
investment : @entity96 has invested in a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity98 , former @entity99 2009 , to whom he also offers his business expertise despite leaving the @entity4 behind , he will not avoid all taxes in the country			2
he owes what is effectively an exit tax on capital gains from stock holdings , even if he does n't sell the shares , @entity112 @entity111 , from the @entity114 ’s law school , told @entity81			1
giving up your citizenship in advance of an initial public offering ( @entity119 ) is ' a very smart idea ' , @entity111 added			0
' once it ’s public you ca n’t fool around with the value			0
' @entity2 plans to price its ipo today , offering 337.4 million shares at $ 28 to $ 35 each , which will be listed on the @entity126 under the symbol @entity2 , @entity81 reported			0
his decision also means he avoids paying the increased income - tax rate when it comes into effect next year			2
it will rise from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent for top earners in the country next year			0
@entity1 has invested in @entity137 , @entity4 and @entity139 companies , his spokesman said			1
now he plans to invest in @entity62 and in other global companies that have interests in entering @entity137 markets			2
despite a substantial boost in their collective fortune from the ipo , @entity1 will unlikely celebrate with @entity146 and the former friends from his college posse			2
@entity1 began with a one - third stake in the company which was watered down when @entity146 began bringing others on board			1
the founders became embroiled in a bitter legal battle which left @entity1 with a 2 per cent stake , according to the @entity156 - and still an incredibly wealthy man			1
blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self - made billionaire			0
he also reportedly drives a @entity162 and lives in a penthouse in one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods			0
party time : @entity96 ( second right ) drinking champagne in @entity5 where he has become renowned for his lavish lifestyle of fast cars and nightclubs according to @entity173 , @entity1 is a fan of hanging out at @entity5 's only private members club filter in the @entity175			1
djs are regularly flown in from around the world and high - end tables come with ice buckets overflowing of bottles of @entity182 vodka and @entity184 champagne			0
the whirlwind of parties , adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time for business apart from @entity96 's investment in @entity192 - a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity98 , former @entity194 whom @entity1 also mentors			1
he has also ploughed money into information site @entity198 and online payment service @entity200			0
the @entity2 share flotation is expected to happen tomorrow , with @entity146 planning to start the ' roadshow ' preceding the initial public offering ( @entity119 ) on monday			0
how it all began : @entity1 was an initial investor in @entity2 at @entity209 , the story of which was depicted in movie @entity210 where he was played by @entity211 ( right ) the social network , now eight years old , has 900million members and was valued at up to $ 79.3 billion			2
it is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world 's biggest - stock market entry of an internet company since @entity219 floated in 2004			1
@entity146 , @entity96 and the original start - up facebook team including @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 were immortalised in the 2010 film @entity210			0
@entity1 was played by @entity211 and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game			2
in reality , @entity1 's former friend @entity146 , who is worth an estimated $ 17.5 billion and is set to make another $ 1 billion from the @entity2 flotation , lives a polar opposite lifestyle			1
the 27 - year - old is rarely seen out of a hoodie and lives a low - key existence with his long - term girlfriend in @entity235 , @entity236			0
he only bought his first property last year			0
high class hang - out : @entity239 , the only private members club in @entity5 at the @entity175 , is said to be one of the @entity62 playboy 's favourite night spots @entity245 's apart : @entity146 in his habitual hoodie talking to @entity250 's @entity249 's earlier this from @entity2 headquarters in @entity252 , @entity236 one thing @entity96 does prize highly is his privacy and closely guards details of his life			1
he attends few of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and rarely gives interviews			0
it is presumably why he chose to set up home in @entity5 which has relatively few tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous compared to the @entity4 and @entity139			0
those who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich friends			0
@entity272 , ceo of @entity5 - based start - ups dropmysite.com and @entity274 told the @entity156 : ' @entity1 does n't invest in much			1
he does n't invest in @entity5 companies			0
' last august , @entity1 was spotted partying with dozens of models in @entity277 and spending $ 50,000 on champagne			0
he flew a number of his friends over from @entity5 and checked into the $ 8,000 - a - night @entity281 before going clubbing until the early hours			2
the entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy @entity283 in @entity284 with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking @entity288 champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other			0
the bar tab reportedly came to a cool $ 50,000 .			0

@entity1 , 30 , migrated to @entity5 ahead of site 's stock market floatation
could save on payout as south - east @entity137 country has no capital gains tax
law states he can be excluded if relocation was deemed for tax avoidance
