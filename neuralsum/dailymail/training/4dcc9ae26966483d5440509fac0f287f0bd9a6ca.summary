by @entity0 a pet dog who was chased over a cliff by two deer survived the 60ft - fall after landing in thick brambles			2
pebbles , a @entity8 terrier , was in her cliff - top back garden in @entity11 , @entity12 , on monday night when the two wild animals came in and chased after her			1
the 16 - year - old plunged down the cliff face and disappeared into the undergrowth and bushes below			1
pebbles , a 16 - year - old @entity8 terrier from @entity11 , @entity12 , had a lucky escape when she fell off a 60ft cliff into some undergrowth after being chased by two deer this shows how far @entity25 fell during the incident			1
pebbles 's owner @entity27 tried to rescue the dog when he heard her whimpers from the bushes below but could not navigate the steep cliff in the dark but when her owners , @entity37 and @entity38 , peered over the edge , they were relieved to hear their pet ’s barks			2
mr @entity27 , 68 , then used a torch to find his way down the cliff path in a bid to find the dog			0
but he was forced to give up after struggling to get through the bushes			2
he said : ' we do get deer in our garden quite often and the other night while @entity25 was outside two of them chased her			1
' she has got failing eyesight and she just fell over the edge of the cliff			0
it is a sheer drop but it is a bit of a jungle at the bottom			0
pebbles was said to be like a ' walking bush ' after he was rescued by coastguard officers ' it was dark so i could n’t see her but i could hear this whimpering bark			1
i went down the path with a torch but the batteries ran out and i ended up getting stuck in the bushes and badly scratched			2
' the couple phoned the coastguards who set up search lights at the bottom of the cliff and cut a 15ft path through the brambles			0
the team had attempted to reach pebbles from the top of the cliff but decided to carry out the rescue from the bottom after finding it too risky			0
they discovered @entity25 , buried in a prickly bush			1
and , despite looking like a ' walking bush ' , the dog was relatively unscathed			1
mr @entity27 said : ' after she was rescued pebbles was covered in brambles and twigs - she was like a walking bush			1
' if it was n’t for the coastguards i do n’t think we would ever have found her			0
' @entity98 , the station officer for @entity100 coastguard , said : ' we cut a path through the undergrowth towards the barking and found the dog buried in it			0
' it was pretty much a sheer drop from the top and the brambles must have cushioned her fall			0
