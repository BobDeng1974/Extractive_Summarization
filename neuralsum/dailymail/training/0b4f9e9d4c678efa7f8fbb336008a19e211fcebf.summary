by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 15:31 est , 22 july 2013 there is one @entity3 birth tradition , dating back several centuries , which the @entity5 was probably happy has been abandoned : the home secretary was not be present at the birth			0
it was once customary for the home secretary , as a senior member of the @entity11 , to attend royal births to ensure the new arrival was a genuine descendant of the monarch and had not an imposter smuggled in			1
but last week the current home secretary , @entity17 , confirmed the convention had firmly been left in the past			1
history : @entity17 , pictured left , confirmed the tradition requiring the home secretary to attend royal births has been firmly left in the past waiting game : but while the home secretary was content not to be involved in the birth of the new royal baby , the rest of the world could n't stay away with thousands of well - wishers gathering outside @entity32 awaiting news of the arrival or the prince or princess hoping for a glimpse : members of the public get ready with their cameras outside @entity32 ahead of the arrival of the royal baby the tradition dated back to the so - called ' @entity43 ' of the late 17th century			1
as @entity45 and @entity46 celebrated the arrival of their new born son , @entity45 , rival families put about that he was an imposter			2
the @entity49 claimed the real child had been born dead and replaced with a new - born infant carried in to the birth chamber in a warming pan			0
the last time a home secretary attended the birth of a future monarch was for the arrival of the @entity46 herself in 1926			1
@entity60 home secretary sir @entity59 was reported to have conveyed the news by special messenger to the lord mayor of london			0
the tradition began after ' @entity65 ' of the late 17th century when rival families put about that the new born son of @entity45 , pictured , and @entity46 was an imposter the last time a home secretary attended the birth of a future monarch was when @entity71 , pictured in the arms of her mother at her christening in 1926 , was born mrs may was quizzed on the tradition while giving evidence to the @entity78 last week			1
@entity60 mp @entity79 , who was chairman of the @entity80 on the @entity81 , said : ' until relatively recently there was a convention that home secretaries attended royal births , i understand this happened with @entity71 , the @entity46			0
he asked : ' do you have any plans to visit the @entity91 wing any time soon , following this convention ? ' mrs may said : ' in fact , it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth , but i suspect mr @entity79 with your royal connections you might have more information about these things than i do			2
' she added : ' the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby had n't been smuggled in			0
' return : the @entity46 arrived at @entity32 this afternoon after leaving @entity106 new child : but it is not yet known when the @entity46 will meet her new grandchild for the first time scrum : the media has gathered outside the hospital awaiting the birth of the future monarch			0
