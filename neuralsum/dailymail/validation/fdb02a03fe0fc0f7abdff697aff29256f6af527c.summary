the 67 - year - old former first lady did not acquire nor use a government email account while serving in the position from january 2009 to february 2013 , @entity9 officials said			1
she also failed to preserve her correspondence on the @entity9 's servers - something that is required of officials under the @entity18 @entity17 - until two months ago			1
and even then , her aides allegedly decided which of her tens of thousands of personal emails to hand over to the department in @entity23 's @entity22 for the public record			1
they ultimately chose to release 55,000 pages of correspondence as she stepped down from the role in 2013 , the @entity25 reported			2
hopefully she has n't already destroyed them			0
governor @entity39 believes transparency is a critical part of public service and of governing			0

' @entity58 officials and government watchdogs have expressed concern over mrs @entity1 's ' extensive ' use of a private account , deeming it ' insecure '			1
on monday , @entity63 , ex-director of litigation at @entity58 , told the newspaper that such a situation was ' inconceivable ' - particularly in relation to a secretary of state 's correspondence			2
' it is very difficult to conceive of a scenario - short of nuclear winter - where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet - level - head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business , ' he said			1
mr @entity63 , now a lawyer at @entity77 and @entity78 , added that although mrs @entity1 is not the first official to use a personal email address for business matters , her sole use of it is unusual			1
concern : the 67 - year - old former first lady ( right ) reportedly did not acquire nor use a government email account while serving in the position from 2009 to 2013			1
on monday , @entity63 ( left ) , ex-director of litigation at the @entity58 , said such a situation was ' inconceivable ' criticism : on monday night , @entity47 governor - and possible 2016 @entity49 presidential candidate - @entity39 called upon @entity94 to release her emails , saying : ' transparency matters ' opponent : @entity39 , seen at a @entity99 community center on monday , has shared his emails with the public ' i can recall no instance ... when a high - ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business , ' he told the newspaper			1
@entity1 's spokesperson @entity110 released a statement regarding the claims on tuesday morning : ' like @entity113 before her , she used her own email account when engaging with any @entity9 officials			1
for government business , she emailed them on their @entity9 accounts , with every expectation they would be retained			2
when the @entity9 asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained , we immediately said yes			0
both the letter and spirit of the rules permitted @entity9 officials to use non-government email , as long as appropriate records were preserved			2
as a result of @entity9 ’s request for our help to make sure they in fact were , that is what happened here			0
as the @entity9 stated , it is in the process of updating its record preservation policies to bring them in line with its retention responsibilities			0
' mrs @entity1 may have violated federal requirements involving the @entity9 's retention of officials ' correspondence by not preserving her correspondence on its servers , the @entity25 reported			1
her aides reportedly did not take any action to have her emails recorded - only unveiling them in january after officials launched a new initiative to comply with federal record - keeping practices			2
' it ’s a shame it did n’t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have , ' remarked @entity159 , the director of the @entity160 in @entity23 he added : ' personal emails are not secure			0
senior officials should not be using them			0
' mrs @entity1 's spokesman , @entity110 , has defended the likely @entity167 presidential candidate 's use of a personal email address , saying she had complied with the ' letter and spirit of the rules '			1
mr @entity110 said that mrs @entity1 had expected her emails would be retained			0
but he declined to detail why she chose to conduct business from her personal account , instead of a government one			1
under federal law , emails sent and received by officials - such as the @entity177 - are seen as government records			0
they are , therefore , required to be retained by the @entity9			0
family : mrs @entity1 is seen with husband , former president @entity94 , and their daughter @entity185 in 2000 several exceptions to the law include sensitive or classified material			0
between 2009 and 2013 , the @entity58 also required such correspondence to be preserved			0
according to the @entity25 , most experts believe that private email accounts should only be used for official government business in emergencies , for both security and in the interest of the public			2
indeed , since coming into office , current secretary of state @entity197 , has used a government email account and continues to retain his correspondence on record , according to his aides			1
it is unclear what security measures were in place on mrs @entity1 's personal account during her time as secretary of state			1
it also unknown how many emails she exchanged while she was in office			0

' after the @entity9 reviewed those emails , last month the @entity9 produced about 300 emails responsive to recent requests from the @entity251			0
' @entity252 is in the process of updating our records preservation policies to bring them in line with recent 2013 @entity58 guidance			0
' she added mr @entity197 is the first secretary of state to ' rely primarily on a state.gov email account '			1
it comes as a family charity which was founded by mr @entity94 remains under scrutiny for accepting millions of dollars in donations from foreign countries while mrs @entity1 was at the @entity9			1
two weeks ago , the @entity266 admitted to violating an ethics agreement with the @entity18 government while @entity94 was in the president 's cabinet			2
it had promised to stop cashing checks from foreign governments with which it had not previously done business			0
