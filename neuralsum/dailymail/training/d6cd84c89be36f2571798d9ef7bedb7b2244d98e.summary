by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 10:06 est , 29 january 2014 keeping his options open : vice president @entity4 said that he has n't decided about running for president in 2016 vice president @entity4 has n't given up on his dream as he said that ' in my heart ' he feels that he could be a good president			1
' i have n't made a decision to run and i have n't made a decision not to run , ' he said in a post-state of the @entity14 interview this morning on @entity15			1
' in the meantime , i 've got a job			0
' he laughed and thanked anchor @entity19 for not asking outright if he was running , but she rephrased the question , making it more about his feelings			0
' in my heart i 'm confident i could make a good president			1
it 's a very different decision to decide whether or not to run for president , and there 's plenty of time for that			1
in another stop on the morning show circuit , @entity4 said that he and his wife have not had any final conversations on the issue			0
' @entity36 and i will make that decision later down the road , ' he told @entity39			2
' if i do the job well and decide to run for president , it will help , if i do n't the job well and decide to run for president , it wo n't help and if i do n't run for president we 'll be okay			1
' when asked if @entity48 's decision whether or not to run will play into his , @entity4 said : ' no not directly			1
' ' the only reason a man or woman should run for president - i 'm sure @entity48 views it the exact same way - is if they think they 're better positioned to do what the nation needs at the moment			1
' he echoed that sentiment during his @entity64 interview on @entity65 : ' if i run it wo n't be who 's in the field , it 'll be whether or not i honestly believe i have a chance to be able to really move this country in a direction that is different from those who are running			2
' while vice presidents are typically the assumed candidate to lead a party at the end of a second term , many in the @entity73 see former secretary of state @entity79 as the likely nominee			0
off topic : the majority of the interviews were dedicated to discussing the @entity84 given last night , but he also touched on former secretary of defense @entity87 ' memoir @entity88 , @entity79 and @entity4 were all presidential candidates in 2008 , and @entity4 's numbers forced him to drop out more quickly than @entity79 , who stayed in till the bitter end against @entity88			2
though some thought that @entity79 would make a good vice president for @entity88 in order to placate the warring factions of the @entity73 party , tensions between the two were still so raw			1
additionally , @entity4 was seen as a way to shore up @entity88 's international credibility given his time as the chairman of the @entity102 foreign relations committee			2
@entity79 's four years as the nation 's top diplomat helped her check that box in president @entity88 's first term , and she now faces the challenge of overcoming the expectations allotted to a front - runner			0
political analysts also read into the fact that president @entity88 decided to sit down for his first televised interview of the second term with @entity79 at his side rather than @entity4			0
in both interviews , which were done remotely from the library at the @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity4 made his first public remarks on former secretary of defense @entity87 ' memoir			0
@entity87 blasted @entity4 in the book , saying that the vice president had been wrong on practically every issue throughout his decades in public office			2
next in line ? vice presidents are typically the assumed successor after two terms , but many believe that @entity48 is the most likely leader of the @entity73 party in 2016 judged on performance : @entity4 said that he has a job to do and if he does well , that would help a 2016 bid @entity4 made a slip in his first remarks , as he twice called @entity135 instead of @entity87 , opting for the @entity138 billionaire 's moniker instead of the secretary of defense			1
' look i like @entity141 , the part i focused on in his book is he said " @entity4 's a man of great integrity "			0
i think he 's a man of integrity as well , ' @entity4 said			0
' the fundamental problem here is that @entity141 and @entity147 - @entity87 and i have disagreed on almost every major foreign policy issue since @entity149			0

the vice president *spoke* this morning about the @entity84 but also answered questions about a possible 2016 presidential bid
said he has n't decided and said that @entity48 's decision would ' not directly ' impact his own
' i 'm confident i could make a good president . it 's a very different decision to decide whether or not to run for president , and there 's time for that '
