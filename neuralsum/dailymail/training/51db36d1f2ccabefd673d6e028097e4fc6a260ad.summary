a new study found healthy menopausal women who carried a well - known genetic risk factor for @entity8 ’s did not experience a decline when they took @entity10			1
the gene variant , known as @entity12 , has been shown to accelerate biological ageing			1
@entity10 may slow the ageing process in middle - aged women susceptible to @entity8 's disease doctor @entity16 , professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the @entity19 , said : ' @entity12 is contributing to ageing at the cellular level well before any outward symptoms of decline become apparent			1
' yet , oestrogen [ found in @entity10 ] appears to have a protective effect for middle - aged women who are carrying this genetic risk factor			1
' numerous previous studies have suggested that @entity12 contributes to age - related mental decline and alzheimer ’s disease			2
the gene variant is present in about 40 per cent of people with late - onset @entity8			1
prof @entity16 ’s team focused on telomeres - caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep @entity38 stable and act like genetic fuses			0
every time a cell divides , its telomeres shorten			0
the research indicates that rapid biological ageing might be associated with @entity44 s in some women if they become too short , the cell can die or lose its ability to divide further			0
this translates to visible signs of ageing , such as wrinkled skin , and other harmful effects within the body			0
telomere shortening varies between individuals and can be used as a measure of biological ageing			0
the scientists analysed telomeres from white blood cells in samples taken from almost 70 healthy women , mostly aged between 45 and 65 , who were on @entity10 women were randomly divided into two groups			1
one remained on hormone therapy while the other halted treatment			0
two years later , the telomeres were checked again and the researchers calculated the rate at which their length had changed			0
the telomeres of women carrying the @entity8 ’s gene were six times more likely than those of non-carriers to have undergone significant shortening over the two year period			1
on average , telomeres of women with @entity12 had shortened by an amount that would normally be expected in a decade			1
the women had effectively aged five times faster than non-carriers			0
but @entity10 cancelled out the negative influence of the gene on telomere length			2
women with @entity12 who continued to have hormone replacement showed no evidence of rapid telomere shortening			2
' this brings us a step closer to being able to identify which women will benefit the most from oestrogen replacement therapy , ' professor @entity94 said .			0

some women have a gene variant , known as @entity12 , which raises risk of *developing* @entity8 's
but taking @entity10 can reduce risk in these women
