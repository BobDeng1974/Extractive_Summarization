from sending mirrors into space to injecting sulphur into the atmosphere , scientists have developed an increasing array of techniques to battle climate change			1
but this type of ‘ climate engineering ’ – which involves manipulating the natural processes after emissions have been released – is only a quick and cheap fix , according to a new report			2
in the long run , such drastic geoengineering measures are ' irrational and irresponsible ' and could ultimately damage the planet , a @entity15 panel of scientists has said			1
from aerosols iron fertilisation of the sea ( left ) to cloud seeding and greening deserts ( right ) , scientists are conjuring up an increasing array of geoengineering techniques to battle climate change			1
but this type of ‘ climate engineering ’ could ultimately damage the planet , a new report says however , the scientists add that some geoengineering concept should be tried out in small projects to learn more about the risks			1
' there is no substitute for dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change , ' said the @entity41 in a two - part report on proposed climate - intervention techniques			1
' if society ultimately decides to intervene in @entity47 's climate , any actions should be informed by a far more substantive body of scientific research , including ethical and social dimensions , than is presently available			2
' the @entity52 - based panel urged against ' albedo - modification technologies , which aim to increase the ability of @entity47 or clouds to reflect incoming sunlight , ' saying they ' pose considerable risks and should not be deployed at this time			1
' the @entity52 - based panel urged against ' albedo - modification ' , which aim to increase the ability of @entity47 or clouds to reflect incoming sunlight , ' saying they ' pose considerable risks and should not be deployed such techniques would only temporarily mask the warming effect caused by high co2 concentrations , and present serious known and possible unknown environmental , social , and political risks , said the report			1
afforestation : this technique would irrigate deserts , such as those in @entity68 and @entity69 , to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide			2
drawback : this vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space , and so contribute to global warming			1
artificial ocean upwelling : engineers would use long pipes to pump cold , nutrient - rich water upward to cool ocean - surface waters			2
drawback : if this process ever stopped it could cause oceans to rebalance their heat levels and rapidly change the climate			0
@entity90 : this involves heaping lime into the ocean to chemically increase the absorption of carbon dioxide			0
drawback : study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures			0
@entity101 iron fertilisation : the method involves dumping iron into the oceans to improve the growth of photosynthetic organisms that can absorb carbon dioxide			0
drawback : study suggests it will have of little use in reducing global temperatures			0
solar radiation management : this would reduce the amount of sunlight @entity47 receives , by shooting reflective sulphate - based aerosols into the atmosphere			1
drawback : carbon dioxide would still build up in the atmosphere			0
carbon dioxide removal is better understood ' but current technologies would take decades to achieve moderate results and be cost - prohibitive at scales large enough to have a sizeable impact , ' it added			0
' direct air capture of carbon is an immature technology with only laboratory experiments carried out to date and demonstration projects in progress , ' the report said			0
' technologies for storing the captured carbon are at an intermediate stage , but only prototypes exist and are not at the scale required for significant sequestration			0
' other techniques such as forest restoration and low - till agriculture are ' mature , readily deployable technologies with well - known environmental consequences , ' the report added			1
@entity148 , for instance , would irrigate deserts , such as those in @entity68 and @entity69 , to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide			0
however , this vegetation would also draw in sunlight that the deserts currently reflect back into space , and so contribute to global warming			1
it follows a similar report last year that found schemes to deliberately manipulate the @entity47 ’s climate could prove useless , and at worst harmful			2
researchers at the @entity163 in @entity164 used software to test the potential benefits and drawbacks of five different geoengineering technologies			0
their study suggests that even when several technologies are combined , geoengineering would be unable to prevent average surface temperatures from rising more than 2 ° @entity173 ) above current temperatures by the year 2100			0
‘ the long - term consequences and side effects of these methods have not been adequately studied , ’ said dr @entity175 from the @entity163 in @entity176 , @entity164			1
one strategy , known as afforestation , would irrigate deserts , such as those in @entity68 and @entity69 , to plant millions of trees that could absorb carbon dioxide			0
such techniques would only temporarily mask the warming effect caused by high co2 concentrations , said the report			2

geoengineering is the deliberate manipulation of environmental processes
techniques include cooling @entity47 by injecting sulphur into the atmosphere
others propose reflecting sunlight from space and irrigating vast deserts
report says these techniques could damage the planet in the long - term
but it adds some concept should be tried out to learn more about the risks
