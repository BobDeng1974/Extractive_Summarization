a record number of @entity3 patients were left waiting for treatment at accident and emergency wards last week , official figures have revealed			1
some 35,373 patients had to wait for longer than four hours to be seen - an increase of 66 per cent on the same period last year			1
at the same time the number of people kept on a trolley for between four and 12 hours before a bed was found doubled from 3,666 to 7,760			1
some 35,373 patients had to wait for longer than four hours to be seen - an increase of 66 per cent on the same period last year @entity16 ’s shadow health secretary @entity15 said last week was ‘ the worst week on record for patients waiting at @entity19 ’			1
he added : ‘ before the @entity21 breaks for @entity22 , ministers need to come and set out the measures they will take to help the @entity3 cope over the @entity22 period			0
‘ @entity16 has been warning the government for months about the growing crisis in @entity19 but it has failed to act			1
but even ministers must now accept that these figures are a worrying wake up call			2
they are proof you ca n't trust the @entity31 with the @entity3			0
‘ @entity32 has allowed @entity19 to sink into crisis and must now accept his responsibility to turn it around			1
’ dr @entity35 , president of the @entity36 and an @entity19 doctor at the @entity38 and @entity39 , told @entity40 's @entity41 it was ‘ a tough year ’ for casualty departments across the country			1
‘ as the figures show this morning , we are seeing record numbers of people attending our @entity19 departments and record numbers of people being admitted to our hospitals , ’ said dr @entity35			1
‘ it 's rather too often like trying to get a quart into a pint pot. there 's a real pressure on beds , particularly between the hours of about 10 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night			2
‘ it does mean that an awful lot of patients are waiting rather longer than they should be to get into hospital , and that backing up in the @entity19 department then means there 's a problem off - loading patients from ambulance trolleys			1
’ shadow health secretary @entity15 said last week was ‘ the worst week on record for patients waiting at @entity19 ’ @entity70 , director of policy at the health think tank the @entity74 , told the programme : ‘ it is pretty bleak			1
the performance numbers that have come out this week are probably the worst we 've seen at this time of year for a very long time			1
and the number of people showing up at @entity19 is continually bouncing at the highest level the @entity3 has ever seen			1
‘ this is only december			0
this is not the peak of the winter period			0
’ dame @entity86 , the national director of commissioning operations for @entity88 , told @entity41 : ‘ the @entity3 is under a huge amount of pressure at the moment			0
we are seeing far more patients than we ever have before			2
‘ but we are still making sure that 91 out of 100 patients receive their treatment - they are either admitted or discharged from hospital - within four hours , which is a really high standard of care			2
‘ of course we are not complacent			0
the standard we set ourselves was that it would be 95 out of 100 patients			2
we have got plans in place to ensure that as we go through the winter , our patients can still be seen swiftly and promptly			2
’ she added : ‘ the nhs in @entity88 is planning to ensure that it can deliver safe services for patients over the winter			0
’ dame @entity86 said that @entity88 was putting in an extra £ 700 million for more beds , doctors and nurses , as well as additional services in the community			0
‘ this is so that we can be prepared for january and february , which we always know are busy months , ’ she said			0
‘ the money has gone into direct frontline services and we are already seeing plenty of places where they 've got extra beds in place and extra staff			0
obviously , sometimes it takes time to recruit staff and open up wards , but the money is available for the front line			0
’ but dr @entity35 said that ‘ very little ’ of the £ 700 million earmarked for frontline services had reached emergency departments , meaning that only ‘ a small number ’ of doctors and nurses were able to be recruited at short notice to respond to the pressure of patient numbers			0
‘ i suspect that a lot of it has gone to shoring up balance sheets in acute trusts , who are probably rather more concerned about the reputation they have with ( regulator ) monitor than anything else at the moment , ’ said dr @entity35 .			0

number of people kept on a trolley between four and 12 hours doubles
shock figures spark alarm in @entity152 over *possibility* of an @entity19 crisis
