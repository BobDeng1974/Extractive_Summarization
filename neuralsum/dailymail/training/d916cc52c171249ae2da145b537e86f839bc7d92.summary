by @entity0 scientists have bred a colony of rabbits that can glow in the dark in a leap forward for developing medicine for life - threatening genetic diseases			1
researchers in @entity9 and @entity10 successfully created the litter of eight rabbits , which included two kits that glow green when the lights are out			1
the florescent coloring is an indicator that genetic material injected into the embryos was incorporated into the rabbit 's natural make up			2
the rabbits , which look identical to their white siblings in daylight , were born at a research center in @entity10			1
life changing : dr @entity28 says the experiment could help mass produce medication ' they live just as long as normal animals do ... and they show no ill effects , ' dr @entity28 told @entity47			1
he added : ' these rabbits are like a light bulb glowing , like an led light all over their body			0
' the experiment , which used florescent protein from jellyfish , furthers the research started in the 1980s when glow in the dark mice were created			1
since then , scientists have recreated the experiment in kittens , puppies , monkeys and piglets			2
while most glow green in the dark , in 2007 @entity66 scientists managed to develop cats that glowed red under ultraviolet light , according to the @entity69			0
scientists hope the research will help them find a way to create cheaper medicine for genetic disorders such as hemophilia			2
they plan to replicate the experiment in farm animals , which would then be used as bio-reactors that produce pharmaceuticals			2
' [ for ] patients who suffer from hemophilia and they need the blood clotting enzymes in their blood , we can make those enzymes a lot cheaper in animals with barrier reactives rather than a factory that will cost billions of dollars to build , ' dr @entity28 said			0
now they have successful created glow in the dark bunnies , the team is planning to create a florescent lamb by november			0
start small : researchers first created glow in the dark mice and plan to repeat the experiment with farmyard animals the team would like to bring their research to the @entity100 but said bureaucracy and fear of using transgenic animals has prevented it			1
' at home , there is this hysteria that transgenic animals should not be used for anything , ' dr @entity28 said			0
he added that the team was committed to the research ' because there is an eventual benefit for the human race in this			0
and if we donâ € ™ t do it in these first - world countries , where will we do it ? '			0

experiment could help mass produce medication for genetic diseases
bunnies bred in @entity10 because of *controversy* over transgenic research
