by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:14 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 9 july 2013 he could have been forgiven for enjoying a well - deserved day off			1
but @entity3 packed in a more than full schedule yesterday – despite having less than two hours ’ sleep after celebrating his emotional triumph in sunday ’s @entity8 men ’s singles final			1
@entity3 crammed in media interviews , sponsors ’ events , dozens of congratulatory phone calls and even a visit to @entity14			1
asked how he managed to keep going after such an exhausting fortnight , the 26 - year - old replied : ‘ @entity17			2
well before 8am , he was heading back to @entity8 after only ‘ an hour or so ’s sleep ’			2

between 8am and 9am he gave no fewer than six @entity22 interviews , including to @entity39 ’s today , @entity41 and @entity40			2

’ responding to questions from fans on @entity59 , he revealed that he had not slept with the @entity8 trophy but that he and miss @entity27 had allowed their two terriers to share the bed			0
at noon , @entity3 travelled to a deprived council estate in @entity65 , @entity66 , where he returned to the court to play tennis against the public as a part of an event organised by one of his sponsors , @entity75			1
this is the moment @entity49 found out what it was like to be on the receiving end of an @entity3 volley – after she dared ask him whether marriage was on the horizon			1
the @entity8 champion snapped during an interview for @entity51 ’s @entity50 when the question of his relationship with 25 - year - old @entity27 came up			1
miss @entity49 said : ‘ i ’m trying to think what your next challenge will be			0
you ’ve had the @entity91 , the @entity92 , now @entity8 – could it be popping the question ? ’ in a cutting reply , @entity3 said : ‘ i only met you like ten minutes ago so i would n’t be telling you first			1
’ however , he then added : ‘ i have n’t planned it			0
it ’s been getting close to eight years now we ’ve been together			0
it ’s a long time			0
’ it is the second time 26 - year - old @entity3 has got a little touchy on the subject this week , after being asked the same question at a press conference on sunday			1
he looked unsettled before replying : ‘ no ... i have n’t thought about that yet			0
’ but while @entity3 may not want to discuss any future wedding , there is speculation he may be planning it imminently			1
bookies are already accepting bets on whether the couple will become engaged later this summer			0
@entity3 revealed yesterday that he was planning to take artist miss @entity54 on a romantic getaway in the @entity115 after his next block of training			1
those close to @entity3 have said that miss @entity54 , who is the daughter of tennis coach @entity120 , brings ‘ calmness ’ to him while he is on court			1
more than 100 people of all ages lined up in the heat for the chance to face the @entity8 champion			2
those who managed to return his serve had their photo taken with @entity3 and his trophy			1
10.50am : hugging the precious trophy at a photocall the star looked slightly bemused as dozens of children surrounded him begging for autographs , with event organisers struggling to calm them down			0
he also gave more interviews , including to @entity115 news outlets			0
asked how he had got through a morning full of media interviews and television appearances , the tennis ace , who normally sleeps for between eight and ten hours a night , explained : ‘ probably just adrenaline			1
‘ i ’m sure the next couple of days i ’ll get to catch up on sleep			0
it ’ll be a busy few days and then i get to relax afterwards			0
’ but there was no time to rest yesterday , as he was whisked to @entity149 , where at 4pm he was cheered into @entity14			0
@entity150 greeted @entity3 and applause rang out from no 10 aides and invited guests , who included @entity155 leader @entity154 , deputy prime minister @entity156 and the @entity158 ’s @entity149 leader @entity157			1
@entity3 , wearing a smart navy suit , sipped a glass of water as he chatted with the political leaders in the @entity14 garden			1
and he had no thoughts of an early night			2
at 9.15pm he and miss @entity27 arrived at @entity165 in @entity166 for a meal with friends , family and other members of @entity171			0
of the coming weeks , the new @entity8 champion said : ‘ i have n’t had much time to think			2
i want to go away on holiday and try and get rest			0
’ all of @entity176 would agree that no one deserves it more			0
