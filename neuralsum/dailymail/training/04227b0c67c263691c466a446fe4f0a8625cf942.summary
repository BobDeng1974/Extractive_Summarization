by @entity0 if you were stuck in a rut in the bedroom who would you turn to for advice ? a best friend ? a therapist ? @entity8 ? one cheeky cartoonist has decided @entity11 's slobbiest resident is in fact the love machine that the rest of us need to be taking sexytime advice from			2
and sorry @entity17 , but you have been replaced in his affections with a cartoon version of ice queen @entity21			2
the fearsome @entity23 editor ( complete with signature bob and black sunglasses ) and a y - front wearing @entity8 appear in a series of risque drawings by @entity31 cartoonist @entity29 in his latest satirical blog entry			1
@entity31 illustrator @entity29 has created a series of sketches offering erotic advice featuring @entity21 and @entity8 titled ' illustrated erotic advice with @entity8 and @entity38 @entity21 ' the work features pictures of the semi-clad cartoon characters showcasing various forms of sexual kinks including role play , submission and even foot fetishism			1
@entity47 was previously a knitwear designer , showing his collections at @entity50 , but the illustrator is now better known as a subversive force via his blog @entity54			0
he describes the blog as a daily society portrait : ' the best illustrated fashion chronicle , a point of view about costume , politics , culture , society and celebrity , ' and describes himself as ' the father of @entity66 , visionary artist , author and critic			1
' talking about his latest work he said : ' @entity8 is the perfect embodiment of the average man today with all his frustrations , desires and weaknesses			2
similarly , @entity21 is the embodiment of the liberated women , a woman of power			2

every character wears a creation of mine , my personal vision of style			0
' it will be interesting to know what fashion queen @entity21 makes of his ' personal vision of style ' as she is depicted in various rather lewd positions wearing little more than thigh - high boots and bunny ears			1
and this is n't the first time that the illustrator has used @entity21 as a reference in his work , previously he has imagined her and several of her high - flying designer friends in the style of @entity130 's favourite family from @entity11			1
@entity131 also transformed the fashion pack , including @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and curator @entity136 , in to bright blue smurfs in celebration of the @entity141 comic and television sensation of 1958			0
