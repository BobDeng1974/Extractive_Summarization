by @entity0 published : 20:20 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 20:26 est , 7 august 2013 this 1940s photo shows @entity2 , whose cells have been used for cancer research for decades information about the most famous and valuable human cells in the history of science is about to become a little harder for researchers to get			1
the @entity10 announced on wednesday that it had reached an agreement with the family of the @entity13 , the @entity16 - @entity15 woman whose cancer cells scientists took without her permission 62 years ago and used to create an endlessly replicating cell line now used in countless labs worldwide			1
under the unprecedented pact , a grandson and a great - granddaughter of lacks , whose story was told in the 2010 best - selling book ' @entity26 , ' will help decide which biomedical researchers will have access to the complete genome data in cells derived from her cervical tumor , called hela cells			1
that data - which can be used to infer medical and other information about @entity2 ' family - will be stored in a secure , @entity10 - controlled database			1
' this is a novel and historic agreement , ' @entity10 director dr @entity40 told reporters , one that will ' protect the family 's interest and also further their commitment to biomedical research			1
' @entity40 and bioethicist @entity49 , @entity10 deputy director for science , outreach , and policy , wrote about the agreement in an essay in @entity55 published on wednesday			2
the decision applies only to researchers funded by @entity10 , which said it ' encourages ' other scientists to abide by the agreement			1
because dna - sequencing technology is cheap and ubiquitous in genetics labs , the @entity61 genome has been partly sequenced many times , and can easily be fully sequenced again			0
' sequencing ' refers to determining the precise order of the chemical letters on a person 's genome , which is the full library of his or her genetic information			0
bits and pieces of that sequence spell out , for instance , whether someone is at risk of diabetes or @entity81 's or other genetic traits , as well as personal traits like the consistency of ear wax			0
in this july 30 , 2013 photo , a researcher places hela cells - which were derived from @entity2 ' genome data - in an incubator at a lab at the @entity91 these loopholes in the access agreement significantly weaken the @entity10 move , said @entity95 , a computational biologist at @entity96 who has raised concerns about threats to genetic privacy			1
' i doubt @entity10 will get blanket agreement from scientists in every country ' to follow its protocol , ' so it 's not clear what the agreement will be able to accomplish			1
' @entity40 emphasized that the plan to control access to the @entity61 genome is a unique response to the fact that @entity2 ' descendants are publicly known			2
' this should not be used to set a precedent for other cell lines , ' he said			0
under @entity15 guidelines , it is still possible to use biological samples ' to generate whole - genome sequencing data without the knowledge or permission of the person providing the sample , ' @entity40 and @entity125 noted , as long as the specimen can not be matched to a named person			2
but thanks to technological advances , nonidentifiability is increasingly illusory			0
earlier this year scientists led by @entity132 of the @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135 , reported that they had managed to identify one person whose genome data - supposedly cloaked in anonymity - had been published , and could do so for others			2
all it took was cross-referencing genomic data with publicly available genealogical , dna and other information , they reported			0
this undated scanning electron micrograph image shows hela cells			0
the cancerous cells , originally taken from @entity2 in 1951 , were the first human cells that could be grown indefinitely in a laboratory @entity10 's decision to control access to the @entity61 genome was prompted by a recent scientific paper that many geneticists and bioethicists viewed as one more insult to lacks and her family			1
in february 1951 , physicians at @entity161 in @entity162 took a biopsy of @entity157 ' aggressive cervical cancer when the tobacco farmer and mother of five was 31			0
the tissue sample , taken without her knowledge , gave rise to the first line of human cells that could grow endlessly in lab dishes			2
lacks died eight months later , decades before federal law prohibited taking biological samples without consent			0
her cells , however , seem immortal , and have been used for both basic biomedical research and the development of polio and other vaccines , cancer therapies , in vitro fertilization techniques , and drugs for herpes , leukemia , influenza , hemophilia and parkinson 's disease			2
although hela cells came from a tumor , that does not prevent them from being used to study some normal processes			0
for decades her children did not know that her cells - the subject of more than 74,000 scientific papers - were being used			0
many were profoundly disturbed when they learned that part of the mother who was taken from them as a young woman lived on in labs that did not even know that ' @entity61 ' stood for a real person			0
@entity209 's 2010 book about the origin of hela cells began to right that wrong			0
but the family was ' shocked and disappointed ' last march , said granddaughter @entity213 , when researchers in @entity215 published a paper that revealed the full @entity61 genome			0
the @entity218 , which posted the @entity61 genome sequence in an open - access database , said at the time : ' we can not infer anything about @entity2 's genome , or of her descendants , from the data generated in this study			1
' in fact , with readily available online tools that translate sequence data , an expert could infer what disease genes and other @entity157 ' descendants carry			0
the information ' was out there for anyone to view with a click of a button , ' @entity213 said			0
' it seemed like history was repeating itself ' as scientists exploited hela cells with no consideration for @entity2 's family			1
@entity209 brought the paper to the attention of the family and the @entity10 's @entity40			2
when the family asked the @entity215 researchers to remove the dna data from the public database where they had posted it , they did so			2
it had been posted for several days			0
the episode prompted @entity10 , encouraged by @entity257 , to meet with the @entity2 family			1
the result is the new agreement , which @entity40 called ' a path forward that respects ( the family 's ) wishes and allows science to progress			2
' controlling access a newly formed group at the @entity10 will review scientists ' applications for access to the full genome sequence data from hela cells			1
the six members - composed of scientists , bioethicists and two of @entity2 ' descendants - will base its decision on whether the researchers are doing biomedical research , promise to keep dna - sequence data in a secure location , do not contact the family , and disclose any commercial interests			1
in addition , researchers who receive @entity10 funding will be expected to deposit further sequencing data from hela cells into an @entity10 database that scientists will access through this process			1
they will also be asked to include in their publications and presentations ' an acknowledgement and expression of gratitude to the @entity2 family , ' @entity10 said , much as they acknowledge their source of funding			1
' the lacks family is honored to be part of an important agreement that we believe will be beneficial to everyone , ' @entity213 said			0
more than 60 years after @entity2 ' cells were taken , they are still the basis for groundbreaking science			1
in this week 's nature , scientists report that they may have solved the mystery of why @entity2 ' cells have been able to survive and proliferate in labs for 60 years , giving rise to innumerable cell lines , where other cancer and normal cells die out			1
the human papilloma virus , which causes cervical cancer , apparently inserted itself near a cancer - causing gene on chromosome 8 in @entity2 ' genome , found @entity321 of the @entity322 and his colleagues			2
the @entity324 activated the ' oncogene , ' perhaps accounting for the aggressiveness of the cancer that killed lacks as well as hela cells ' ability to reproduce every 24 hours and never stop .			0

scientists took @entity2 ' cancer cells without her permission 62 years ago and used them to create an endlessly replicating cell line now used in countless labs worldwide
the @entity10 has reached an agreement with @entity2 ' family that will enble *relatives* to decide which researchers get access to @entity2 ' cell data going forward
