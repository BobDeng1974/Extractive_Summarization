by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:39 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 12:19 est , 5 november 2012 @entity2 said @entity4 's @entity3 had seen the national debt rise from $ 500billion to $ 1.3trillion cabinet minister @entity2 appears to have taken sides in the @entity8 election , less than 48 hours before @entity8 go to the polls			1
in an apparent break with impartiality before polling day , the senior @entity10 defended @entity15 @entity14 from claims he is ‘ stupid ’ while warning @entity18 @entity4 ’s economic strategy had created a ‘ very worrying picture indeed ’			1
the comments from a senior member of the @entity23 government less than two days before voting takes place are likely to raise eyebrows on both sides of the @entity28			2
the conservatives are aligned to the @entity15 , but @entity30 has played up his relationship with mr @entity4 who remains hugely popular in the @entity23			1
@entity23 ministers of all parties have traditionally avoided commenting on foreign elections , because their government will have to work with whoever wins , particularly when the result is too close to call			1
but mr @entity2 used a radio interview to hit out at the ‘ appalling demonisation ’ of mr @entity14 while warning mr @entity4 ’s presidency had seen the @entity8 deficit had rise ‘ gone from something like $ 500billion to $ 1.3trillion or so ’			1
however , @entity45 today appeared to distance itself from the remarks			0
asked whether @entity30 shared mr @entity2 's concerns , the prime minister 's official spokesman told a regular @entity52 media briefing : ‘ i do n't think it is appropriate for me to be commenting on the @entity8 and the @entity8 economy and the record over the last few years this week			2
’ mr @entity2 insisted he did not know mr @entity14 personally , and was not necessarily a ‘ fan ’			0
but the @entity57 told @entity58 : ‘ the demonisation of @entity14 over here has been appalling really			2
but this is a guy who ran a state very well			0
‘ he got their debts and deficit down			0
he 's turned around businesses			0
whatever else you may say about him , he is not stupid , and he is made out to be stupid over here			0
’ @entity30 has garnered positive publicity from his relationship with @entity4 including hosting a @entity45 barbecue in may last year mr @entity14 ’s visit to the @entity23 this summer was dominated by gaffes , including questioning preparations for the @entity75 saying it was ‘ hard to know just how well it will turn out ’			1
he also described ‘ looking out of the backside of 10 @entity45 ’ and referred to @entity79 as ‘ mr leader ’			0
mr @entity14 faced fifficult questions when he visited @entity45 in july but mr @entity2 blamed the @entity23 media : ‘ i think sometimes our reporting ... particularly the print media have tended to convey a very shallow two - dimensional fight			0
‘ the @entity8 election has been appallingly reported , i think , in the @entity23			1
it has been misrepresented , the whole nature of it			0
’ he went on to cast doubt about on mr @entity4 ’s attempts to turn the @entity8 economy around by borrowing more money			1
‘ we do n't want the @entity8 economy to go off the edge of a cliff , but at the same time , we ca n't sustain the level of debt that @entity8 is piling up with its increased deficits			2
‘ the present administration , they 've gone from something like $ 500billion to $ 1.3trillion or so , so there comes a moment when these have to be paid back			0
' so while we want @entity8 to grow , we also do n't want it to grow though on just simply stacked up borrowed debt			2
’ highlighting the importance of an @entity8 recovery to @entity23 's prospects , mr @entity2 said : ‘ the fact that it ( the @entity8 economy ) has n't bounced back from this recession , arguably for the first time since the war , makes it a very worrying picture indeed - with unemployment really historically very high in the @entity8 and really not a lot of serious new economic activity taking place			1

@entity57 breaks with the convention of @entity23 ministers not commenting on foreign elections
he leaps to the defence of the @entity15 *challenger* and points out @entity8 debt has risen under @entity4
with less than 48 hours to go , the result is too close to call
