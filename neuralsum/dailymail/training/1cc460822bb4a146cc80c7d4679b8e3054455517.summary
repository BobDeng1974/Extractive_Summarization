children born as a result of @entity3 are a third more likely to get cancer , a major study found			1
scientists said those born after fertility treatments were 33 per cent more likely to have childhood cancer			1
they were 65 per cent more likely to develop leukaemia and 88 per cent more likely to develop cancers of the brain and central nervous system			1
children born as a result of @entity3 are more likely to develop childhood cancer the study suggests fertility treatment may change the way certain genes function when they are passed from parent to child in a process known as ‘ genomic imprinting ’			1
these faults in genes are linked to childhood cancers , the @entity24 researchers said			2
they warned these changes could be triggered by aspects of fertility treatment such as exposure to hormones , semen preparation , freezing embryos , growth conditions of embryos or delayed insemination			2
but they could not rule out the chance that the increased risk was the result of parents ’ infertility , not the treatment			2
earlier this year , @entity45 research on more than 100,000 children born after fertility treatment found they had no increased risk of cancer			1
in vitro fertilisation ( @entity3 ) is among the most widely used fertility techniques , with around 18,000 @entity3 babies born in @entity45 each year			1
the study suggests fertility treatment may change the way certain genes function when they are passed from parent to child in a process known as ' genomic imprinting ' an egg is removed from the woman ’s ovaries and fertilised with sperm , then returned to the womb to grow			0
the research , in the journal @entity65 and @entity66 , reviewed 25 studies from 12 developed countries , including the @entity71 , the @entity45 , @entity24 , @entity72 and @entity73 , from 1990 to 2010			0
plans for @entity45 to become the first country to create babies using dna from three parents were condemned by @entity79 last night			1
the treatment can reduce the risk of children having potentially fatal illnesses			0
damaged dna from a mother at risk of passing on a mitochondrial disease such as muscular dystrophy is substituted with some from a healthy female donor			0
the technique was recommended to @entity90 by the @entity91 this year after a consultation			0
the eight mps were among 34 members of the @entity96 , the human rights group made up of @entity98 politicians , who called it ‘ incompatible with human dignity and international law ’			0
‘ the results of the largest meta - analysis on this topic to date indicate an association between fertility treatment and cancer in offspring , ’ wrote author dr @entity102 , of the @entity104 research centre , @entity105			1
‘ the etiology [ origin ] of childhood cancer is still largely unknown , but it has been hypothesized that fertility treatment may play a role			1
’ one theory is that anti-oestrogen drugs that stimulate ovulation are similar to diethylstilbestrol , a drug once given to pregnant women to stop complications , but later linked to childhood cancer			1
the researchers stressed that the risk of cancer among children born after fertility treatment remains low			2
they wrote : ‘ infertile couples may already have an increased number of epigenetic defects			0
which come to light through the treatment process			0
’ most children in the studies were born after ivf but some couples used other techniques such as intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection or intrauterine insemination			0
dr @entity142 , the chairman of the @entity143 , said : ‘ although this paper reports an apparent increase in the incidence in childhood cancer , the association is small and it is still not possible to say whether it is a consequence of @entity3 or the underlying infertility of the parents			1
’ cancer is the second biggest cause of death of children in developed countries			2
around 1,600 children are diagnosed each year in @entity45			0
a spokesman for the @entity91 said : ‘ a recent @entity45 study found there to be no increased risk of cancer to children as a result of assisted reproduction treatment			2
’ @entity166 is medical director at @entity167 , which promotes ‘ mild ivf ’ , with fewer fertility jabs and lower dosages			0
she said : ‘ this is an interesting study which raises concerns about potential long - term effects of fertility treatment on children			0

@entity3 babies are 65 per cent more likely to develop leukaemia
they are nearly 90 per cent more likely to develop a form of brain cancer
