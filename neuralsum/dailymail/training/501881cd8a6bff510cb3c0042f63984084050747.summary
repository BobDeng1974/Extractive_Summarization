thousands of stargazers cast their eyes to the heavens last night to watch the @entity4 meteor shower			1
across the @entity6 people turned into amateur astronomers as they looked out for the ' shooting stars ' , a result of material falling from the tail of @entity12			2
while the @entity4 meteor shower is an annual event between @entity15 and mid-august , the best views this year were expected to be last night , with as many as 60 meteors an hour visible to the naked eye			1

it 's been one of the best showers in years			0
weather perfect too ' , while @entity56 tweeted : ' so far about 60 over wisbech , lovely show tonight '			0
the moon was in a waxing crescent , meaning its light did not significantly interfere with the view , the @entity59 said			0
the weather also helped , with clear skies over large swathes of the @entity6 from central southern @entity67 , to @entity68 , the @entity69 and @entity70 , up to southern @entity71 , as well as south east @entity72			0

' @entity108 , commonly known as shooting stars , are the result of small particles entering the @entity113 's atmosphere at high speed			1
these heat the air around them , causing the characteristic streak of light seen from the ground			0

the perseid meteor shower is sparked every august when the @entity113 passes through a stream of space debris left by comet @entity12 rising star : a meteor is seen during the @entity4 meteor shower over one of the stones of @entity159 's @entity158 henge monument in @entity160 this is the annual @entity4 as witnessed from @entity162 , @entity163 , today at 2am			1
the image was captured by photographer and ' @entity167 ' @entity166 although the number of visible meteors is always hard to predict accurately , stargazers were expected to see one at least every few minutes			2
they mostly appear as fleeting flashes lasting less than a second , but the brightest ones leave behind trails of vaporised gases and glowing air molecules that may take a few seconds to fade			0
dr @entity176 , meteorites curator at the @entity177 in @entity178 , said : ' we are learning more and more about comets from various observations using telescopes around the world and space missions , such as @entity185 , which has collected cometary dust particles and returned them for study in labs on @entity113			2
' scientists around the world , including those at the @entity177 and other @entity6 research institutions are actively studying comets to better understand the birth and formation of the @entity195 and the potential ( or not ) risk of an impact with @entity113 in the future			0
' the @entity4 ( and other meteor showers ) happen at " fixed " times of the year as the @entity113 orbits the @entity201 and crosses the streams of dust left by the comets as they orbit the @entity201 â€™ @entity12 , which last passed near the @entity113 in 1992 , and will not visit again until the year 2125			1
professor @entity204 , of @entity205 , said : ' every meteor is a speck of comet dust vaporising as it enters our atmosphere at 36 miles per second			0
what a glorious way to go			0

perseid meteor shower happens annually between @entity15 and mid-august but best views were expected last night
up to 60 meteors an hour were visible from the comet @entity12 and wo *n't* be seen again until 2125
