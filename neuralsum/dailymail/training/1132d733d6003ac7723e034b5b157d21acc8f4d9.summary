by @entity0 the @entity2 television journalist @entity1 has had plenty to worry about in his time			1
in his days as a reporter he saw the bodies of @entity7 being bulldozed into a mass grave ; he was caught up in an anti-american mob in @entity10 and shot at by the @entity11			0
yet the thing that really bothered him was the prospect of going bald			0
on the way home from reporting on an isolated @entity19 tribe , he locked himself in the plane loo to examine his receding hairline , contemplating a vision of his future that went : ' @entity24 in @entity25 ' ( a byword for cultural desolation since @entity29 's 1983 novel of that name )			2
cell reading : @entity31 took the @entity32 to jail with her in 2007 his wife - to - be , @entity34 , assured him his hair was not about to set him on the fast track to destitution			1
so did his psychiatrist , from whom he had sought help after turning to drugs after a long stint of war reporting			0
at 37 , in love and with his career soaring , @entity1 was beset with anxiety			1
at this serendipitous moment , his producer suggested he should read a book by someone named @entity52			1
her exact words were : ' you might like him			0
it 's all about controlling your ego			2
' @entity52 , it transpired , had written a couple of self - help books , which became celebrity sensations			1
@entity61 endorsed @entity32 ; @entity31 took it to jail with her ; and @entity64 gave a copy to @entity66 , who plugged it on her show			1
' at first , ' @entity1 writes , ' the book struck me as irredeemable poppycock			1
' but , unexpectedly , ' @entity52 began to unfurl a fascinating thesis that made me think he must have spent an enormous amount of time inside my skull '			1
the revelation concerned the inner critic in our heads that provides an unhelpful running commentary on our actions			0
thriving on drama , resentment and ambition , obsessed with the past and the future , heedless of the present , it 's never satisfied			2
the realisation that ' the voice inside my head was kind of an a * * hole ' was the start of a remarkable conversion to the practice of mindfulness			0
convert : despite the pain from the posture , @entity1 became a fan of meditation it was n't a straightforward journey			2
@entity1 's journalistic scepticism kept kicking in at inconvenient moments , such as a ten - day meditation retreat where the rules included ' no talking , no reading , no sex '			1
he spent his 39th birthday there , tormented by back pain from the yogic postures and infuriated by the drippy voice of a shawl - wearing teacher named ( inevitably ) @entity117			0
unconvinced by @entity52 's uneasy melange of good sense and mystic waffle , @entity1 finally found a plausible guru in the person of a @entity124 - educated psychiatrist , author and @entity127 dr @entity126 , who managed to convey the essential principles of mindfulness and compassion without the dismaying accretion of loopy psycho - babble			1
five years since @entity1 first heard of @entity52 , he has n't quite achieved enlightenment			1
his ego still seems on fine form , to judge by the way he compares himself with @entity137			0
and his satisfaction at finding himself in the vanguard of a fashionable movement is touching : these days almost everyone acknowledges the benefits of mindfulness			0
not everyone will find @entity1 a congenial guide to mindfulness			2
his gung - ho journalistic style , fearlessly sprinkled with cliche and innocent of irony , is an unusual conduit for the message of compassion and calm			0
but his answer to a colleague sceptical of ' the whole meditation thing ' , is remarkably persuasive			0
' i do it , ' he said , ' because it makes me 10 per cent happier			0

@entity2 television journalist @entity1 was beset with anxiety
told to read @entity52 's self help book @entity32
led to change in his mindset
and a self help book of his own
