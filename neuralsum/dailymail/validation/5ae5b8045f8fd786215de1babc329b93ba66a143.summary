in what doctors are calling an extraordinarily rare case of survival , a 22 - month - old @entity1 boy whose lifeless body was pulled from an icy creek was revived after an hour and 41 minutes of @entity8 , and has suffered virtually no lingering effects			1
@entity10 came home from the hospital on sunday , and his doctors said thursday he has made a full recovery			2
' it 's not only extraordinarily rare that we got the kid back , but what 's even more extraordinary is the rate at which he recovered and the completeness of his recovery , ' said dr. @entity22 , director of the pediatric intensive care unit at @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26			2
' @entity10 and two of his brothers had gone outside to play on march 11 when , at some point , he fell into the stream that runs through their five - acre property near @entity32 and was swept away by the fast - moving current			1
his seven - year - old brother , @entity45 , ran into the house and screamed that he could n't find @entity10			1
their mother , @entity47 , did a quick search of the property before realizing her young son had likely fallen into the creek , which was swollen because of melting snow			0
she called 911 while her two teenage daughters began walking downstream in a frantic search for the toddler			0
scene of the incident : @entity10 's body temperature was 77 degrees , more than 20 degrees below normal , after he fell into this river - against all odds , his heart restarted after cpr it was a neighbor who found @entity10 nearly a quarter - mile away , caught up in a tree branch , the water gushing around his body			1
an ambulance crew arrived moments later , found no pulse and began @entity8			1
resuscitation would continue , unbroken , for 101 minutes - in the ambulance , at a community hospital , aboard a medical helicopter and , finally , in the emergency room of @entity77 , the pediatric wing of @entity79 , where a team of some 30 doctors and nurses sprang into action			1
@entity10 's body temperature was 77 degrees when he arrived , more than 20 degrees below normal			1
in this case , the boy 's profound hypothermia worked to his advantage , dramatically slowing his metabolism and giving his organs ' some degree of protection from cardiac arrest , ' @entity22 said			0
knowing that , @entity22 ordered cpr to continue while the team slowly warmed his body			1
at around 82 degrees , they detected a pulse			2
against all odds , his heart had restarted			1
hours later , @entity10 regained consciousness - and his brain function was normal , stunning doctors yet again			1
' it was an act of @entity104 , ' said his grateful mother , @entity47			0
' there is no doubt in my mind it 's a miracle			0
@entity104 had the right people in the right place at the right time and they all did a wonderful job			0
' dr. @entity114 , the attending physician in the pediatric intensive care unit , said @entity10 belonged in a ' rare , rare , extreme category for recovery			2
' a week later , the medical team is still on a high			0
it ' provides us with a smile on our face , knowing you were part of something this wonderful and amazing , ' @entity114 said			0
back at home , @entity10 is walking - though he still needs to regain a bit of balance - and chattering away			2
but not about his ordeal			0
' it 's hard to tell how much he remembers or knows about what happened , ' his mother said			0
' he ca n't really tell us in that way			0
