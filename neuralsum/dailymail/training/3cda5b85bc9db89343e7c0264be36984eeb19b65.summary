by @entity0 , @entity2 political editor and @entity4 reporter published : 02:06 est , 26 november 2013 updated : 08:22 est , 26 november 2013 president @entity5 has been forced to defend the nuclear deal with @entity7 from growing criticism - both from @entity9 and from allies abroad , notably @entity11			1
legislative aides to @entity13 and @entity15 @entity14 told @entity16 that there 's a consensus on @entity19 that the @entity20 has bent too far in @entity22 's direction			1
and their bosses have asked for a slate of legislative options by the end of the brief @entity28 recess			0
' somebody has to make sure the @entity32 does n’t explode , ' an adviser to a senior @entity13 @entity30 said monday morning , ' and no one else seems to have their eye on the ball			0
' even @entity37 @entity36 has promised to look at passing even tougher sanctions on @entity7 that would go into place if the @entity41 republic does n't keep up its end of the bargain			2
the debate will begin as soon as @entity9 returns to session on december 9			0
on monday , @entity5 rose to defend the agreement , which he has made a cornerstone of his second - term foreign policy			2
' tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically , but it 's not the right thing to do for our security , ' he said at an event in @entity86			0
the president called the deal ' clear - eyed and principled diplomacy			2
an aide to a senior @entity15 @entity14 said that he had already begun working with ' an outside expert ' to draft legislative language that would be circulated among ' a small , select group ' of congressmen			1
' but this is n't your usual " us versus them " deal , ' the aide said			2
' senior democrats will see this draft too			0
and i 'm betting it would be the only one making the rounds by the end of the week			0
' some republicans on the @entity13 side of the @entity109 are also spoiling for a fight over the @entity5 administration 's surprising pact with @entity7 president @entity54			1
is the devil in the details ? @entity117 @entity14 sen. @entity116 said sunday that ' [ t ] here is now an even more urgent need for @entity9 to increase sanctions ' despite the @entity15 's posture , ' until @entity7 completely abandons its enrichment and reprocessing capabilities			1
' @entity66 chairman @entity65 , a @entity124 @entity30 , has so far limited his comments to an endorsement of what another @entity15 aide told @entity16 is ' the weakest plan on the table , ' one that would include a six - month trigger to give @entity7 ample time to keep – or break – its promises under its deal with the @entity2 and other world powers			1
' i expect that the forthcoming sanctions legislation to be considered by the @entity13 will provide for a six month window to reach a final agreement before imposing new sanctions on @entity7 , ' @entity65 said sunday			1
president @entity5 echoed this line in his speech saturday night			2
' if @entity7 does not fully meet its commitments during this six - month phase , we will turn off the [ sanctions ] relief and ratchet up the pressure , ' he said			1
but this approach wo n't meet with approval from many @entity152 who are just as eager to force @entity5 into a veto showdown as they are to demonstrate a tough - on - @entity7 posture going into the 2014 election season			1
an anti-iran video caught online fire over the weekend , depicting the @entity161 's regime as virulently anti-american and hinting that @entity5 's deal with @entity54 is a foolish one not impressed : @entity11 's prime minister @entity164 denounced the nuclear agreement with @entity7 as a historic mistake that leaves the production of atomic weapons within @entity22 's reach @entity171 @entity170 sen. @entity170 captured @entity19 's fears about the @entity7 nuclear deal , worrying that a huge carrot will help @entity7 ignore a tiny stick			1
' we had a chance to deliver a body blow , ' he said ' we 're going to be the stick in the mud , ' predicted the second @entity14 staffer , who works for a @entity15 @entity14 on the @entity182			1
' the president has committed us to a dangerous course of action , i think , and we 're setting ourselves up to lose @entity11 as an ally			0
lots of members here will be happy to paint @entity5 into a corner and make him veto tougher sanctions that what he just let @entity54 weasel out of			1
' peace for our time ? @entity2 secretary of state @entity196 ( r ) shakes hands with @entity7 foreign minister @entity198 ( @entity199 ) at the @entity200 in @entity201 november 24 , 2013 ' and none of this six - month - grace - period nonsense , ' he added			1
' let 's do it now			0
' global reactions have been muted , with most world leaders expressing tepid support			0
@entity210 foreign minister @entity209 said his country ' has consistently called on @entity7 to exercise flexibility on the matter			2
we want to keep a close watch in a way to help implement this agreement			0
' @entity220 @entity219 spokesman @entity218 said his nation ' welcomes the prospect of resolving questions related to @entity7 's nuclear programme through dialogue and diplomacy			2
' closer to the @entity32 region , reactions were more strident			0
@entity231 ' considers it to be a historic accord which guarantees the interests of the brotherly @entity7 people , ' the @entity41 regime 's foreign office said			2
@entity11 's prime minister @entity164 said sunday that ' [ w ] hat was achieved yesterday in @entity201 is not a historic agreement but rather a historic mistake			0
' added pressure on @entity2 lawmakers is coming from a @entity243 video that has been seen by more than 1.1 million people since friday			0
titled simply ' @entity245 , ' the anonymously authored video contains a laundry list of anti-american statements from @entity7 leaders , read over a series of editorial cartoon - style drawings and a soundtrack full of riotous crowd noises			2
during his recent presidential campaign , according to the video 's narrator , @entity54 said that ' saying " @entity258 " is easy ; we need to express " @entity258 " with action			0
' speaking exclusively to @entity16 , the video 's creator – who requested anonymity – said that @entity2 ' need to know the @entity7 threat is not focused on @entity11			0
' ' imagine if @entity11 did not exist , ' he said			0
' then imagine what we would be thinking about " @entity258 " [ statements ' from people who commit suicide on a regular basis and have a deliverable nuclear weapon			0
' @entity15 majority leader @entity276 called the deal ' dangerous ' on monday morning , noting that it fell short of the recommendations of the @entity281 @entity280 appearing sunday on @entity285 's ' @entity284 ' program , secretary of state @entity196 would n't respond directly to a question about whether the president would veto any new @entity7 sanctions @entity9 might pass			1
' i believe @entity9 will recognize that this deal actually has a great deal of benefit in it , and i look forward to going up and working with our colleagues on the hill in order to try to persuade them that this is not the moment to increase sanctions , ' @entity196 said			0
@entity196 met with @entity302 foreign secretary @entity301 on sunday after taking part in the breakthrough talks that are temporarily curbing @entity7 's nuclear activity several democrats in the @entity13 , where @entity196 served before joining the @entity5 administration , have already expressed dismay at what they see as a lopsided deal between the @entity15 and @entity54			1
' this disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that @entity13 and @entity14 will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in december , ' @entity313 @entity312 sen. @entity311 said sunday in a statement			1
@entity14 sen. @entity170 said monday on @entity319 that ' we had a chance to deliver a body blow , ' against @entity7 , since ' the sanctions [ already in place ] actually worked			1
' ' but this interim deal gives the @entity7 $ 7 billion in cash , ' he complained , ' and it leaves in place one of the most sophisticated enrichment programs around			2
' house speaker @entity329 hinted on sunday that @entity2 must maintain as much pressure on @entity22 as the @entity15 will allow			0
otherwise , @entity329 said , ' we will look back on the interim deal as a remarkably clever @entity7 move to dismantle the international sanctions regime while maintaining its infrastructure and material to pursue a break - out nuclear capability			1

legislators are readying bills that would force @entity5 to choose between backing off from his @entity7 deal and vetoing tough new sanctions
' we 're going to be the stick in the mud , ' says one @entity15 @entity14 aide
lopsided deal ' makes it more likely that @entity312 and @entity14 will join together and pass additional sanctions , ' predicts liberal @entity311
@entity5 and sen. @entity65 are holding firm on a six - month grace period for the @entity54 regime , but @entity19 is *rumbling* with *discontent*
