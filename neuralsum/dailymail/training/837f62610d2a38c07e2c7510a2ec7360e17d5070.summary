by @entity1 reporter on - loan @entity4 players @entity2 and @entity5 scored against their parent club as already doomed @entity7 made it three wins out of three for the first time this season with a 34 - 28 victory over the @entity4 at the @entity13 , @entity14			1
the championship - bound @entity7 had surprisingly beaten champions @entity16 and @entity17 finalists @entity19 in their previous two games and gained a third successive success by coming from 12 points down to outscore their @entity24 opponents six tries to four with @entity26 , who also had a spell on loan at @entity4 , adding five goals for the hosts			1
@entity4 have now won just one of their last eight games , ironically against @entity34 leaders @entity35 , and this latest defeat virtually ends any realistic hopes of extending their season into the play - offs			1
@entity4 remain five points behind @entity41 , who hold the eighth and final play - off place , with only three games remaining			1
close win : @entity7 ' @entity46 is tackled by @entity4 's @entity47 during his side 's @entity34 victory the visitors took advantage of strong and blustery wind to get the better of a first half played in occasionally squally showers but , once the sides had swapped ends , the @entity7 always held the upper hand			1
helped forward by a penalty for interference , some slick handling and a neat inside pass from @entity62 put @entity63 in beside the posts for his 15th try of the season with @entity67 converting to give the @entity4 the best possible start			2
@entity46 almost grabbed a try back but was forced into touch near the corner flag by @entity63			0
@entity72 almost put @entity73 clear but @entity74 thwarted the attack before @entity47 helped double the visitors lead form close range after the @entity7 had again been penalised , this time for reefing , near their own line			0
poor ball control did not help the hosts ' cause and they were forced to soak up more pressure before , on a rare venture forward , a @entity46 kick was allowed to bounce fortuitously for the @entity7 and @entity86 , on a season - long loan from the @entity88 , sent @entity26 racing over on the left to score , then convert his own try , topping the 1000 career points mark in the process			1
@entity4 had chances to restore their advantage as @entity72 was denied a try by a forward pass , then @entity73 intercepted a loose pass from @entity46 but @entity97 executed a fine stop			0
but a minute later a @entity100 break sent @entity86 racing 30 metres into the corner to touchdown , although @entity26 was unlucky to see his conversion swept onto the near upright by the wind and bounce out again			0
barely three minutes into the second half , good work from @entity100 created a chance for @entity108 to power over and give the @entity7 the lead for the first time			0
five minutes later @entity2 dummied his way over for a second try against his parent club , then @entity100 split the defence gifting @entity5 with a try and , with @entity26 adding all three conversions , the momentum swing was complete at 28 - 12			0
@entity47 grabbed a quick - fire try back for @entity4 and @entity119 was adjudged to be held up just before the hour mark as @entity4 tried to get back in the game			2
but an @entity122 try with ten minutes to go made the points safe for the @entity7 , although @entity124 claimed a late try and @entity126 added a further consolation for the @entity4 with @entity72 finishing with four goals .			2

@entity7 won their third consecutive match for the first time this season
in their previous two games they beat champions @entity16 and @entity17 finalists @entity19
despite being 12 points behind against @entity4 , they *roared* back to victory
@entity4 have won just one of their last eight @entity34 games
the latest defeat *effectively* *shatters* their *dream* of *appearing* in play - offs
