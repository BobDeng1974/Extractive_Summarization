@entity1 shipping tycoon @entity0 , pictured wearing trousers at his home in @entity4 a wealthy new backer of the @entity7 @entity6 claims women who wear trousers are ' deliberately ’ making themselves unattractive to men			1
@entity1 tycoon @entity0 , who believes not wearing a skirt is ‘ hostile behaviour ’ , gave @entity6 £ 10,000 this year - a fifth of all its cash donations			1
but the parlous state of the party ’s finances has forced officials to issue a begging letter to supporters for money – and policies			1
the surge in interest and support for @entity28 ’s anti-eu has not been matched in its bank balance			0
mr @entity28 's attempts to win support in @entity32 backfired yesterday , when an angry protest in @entity34 forced him to take refuge in a pub before being escorted to safety by police			0
mr @entity0 gave @entity6 £ 5,000 in february and another £ 5,000 in march , as the party prepared for local elections which saw it take almost one in four votes cast			1
but mr @entity0 ’s views on women – and what they wear – are likely to raise eyebrows			1
he is the author of a book entitled @entity49 : a @entity51 in which he photographed women from behind and then commented on their clothes			0
in it he claimed that the ratio @entity7 of women wearing trousers to skirts is 10 to 1			0
‘ the interesting thing about this phenomenon is that , because women can not see themselves from the rear , the vast majority of women are unaware that trousers are very unflattering to them , ’ he said in the 2003 book			2
' trousers are made for men 's bodies , which are mostly straight up and down			0
' women 's bodies on the other hand consists of curves			0
women have big bottoms - they are meant to have big bottoms			2
@entity77 , pictured wearing trousers in @entity79 this week , was once branded a ' @entity81 tart ' by the businessman ' countless women who would look lovely in dresses or skirts are embarrassingly unattractive in trousers			0
’ he warned that @entity7 had a high divorce rate and low marriage rate , and suggested women were not helping their chances of finding a husband by wearing trousers			2
‘ the more women dress like men , the less they are attractive to men			0
if a man finds a woman attractive , he will find her legs sexy even if they are not perfect , simply because they are her legs			0
‘ women know that men do n't like trousers , yet they deliberately wear them , ’ he continued in the bizarre coffee table book			1
' walk along any street and you see women using trousers like a uniform every single day			0
this is hostile behaviour - they are deliberately dressing in a way that is opposite to what men would like			1
' it is behaviour that flies against commons sense , and also flies against the normal human desire to please			1
’ in an interview plugging the book , he was asked if was pleased at the rise of curvy stars like @entity77			0
but mr @entity0 he told @entity122 : ' she looks like a @entity81 tart '			2
at the launch of the book his ex wife @entity125 told reporters : ' he is deeply sexist			0
' according to records from the @entity130 , mr @entity0 ’s two donations to @entity6 are the first time the 78 - year - old has given money to a political party			1

by comparison both @entity140 and the @entity141 were given £ 3.7million , the @entity143 received £ 842,710 and even the @entity144 had a donation of £ 295,775			1
@entity6 has now launched a drive to find more people to do the same			2
a begging letter sent to supporters highlights a lack of money , staff and policies			1
treasurer @entity154 complains that recent boosts in opinion polls have ‘ disappointingly , not yet resulted in a surge of donations ’			1
@entity6 leader @entity28 's attempts to win support in @entity32 backfired yesterday , when an angry protest in @entity34 forced him to take refuge in a pub before being escorted to safety by police he reveals the party has set up a separate campaign account for the 2014v @entity169 election to attract backers who want to take a tougher line on @entity172 , but fear a strong @entity6 showing at the 2015 election could cost the @entity141 support and allow @entity175 to form a @entity140 government			2
mr @entity154 said it was becoming a priority ‘ to hire some very good people to fill several roles ’			2
‘ above all , we have got to improve our policy production			0
for one thing the other parties will be attacking us on policy and we need to be quite clear what our ripostes are , ’ the letter added , according to @entity182 .			0

@entity1 tycoon @entity0 gave @entity6 £ 10,000 - a fifth of all cash donations this year
