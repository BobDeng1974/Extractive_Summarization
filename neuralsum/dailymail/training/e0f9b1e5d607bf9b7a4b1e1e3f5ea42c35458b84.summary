@entity1 force winds and driving rain might not sound like fun to most of us but for surfer @entity6 , 34 , stormy weather means the chance to pit his skills against towering 80ft waves			1
but the incredible photographs of @entity6 tackling the surf created by the @entity13 's storm in @entity14 yesterday did n't impress everyone			1
critics condemned his feat as ' stupid ' and ' idiotic ' and called on him to show a more responsible attitude towards his family			1
now his wife @entity20 , 37 , has hit back at the critics , arguing that surfing is what her husband was born to do and revealing her pride in his achievement			1
happy family : surfer @entity6 and his wife @entity20 with their two children , honey , six , and @entity32 , one adorable : @entity20 says she hopes her one - year - old son @entity32 wo n't become a surfer like his father ' i feel a mixture of things when i watch him doing something like that , ' she said in an exclusive interview with @entity44			1
' i 'm really pleased for him because he 's doing what he loves , what he 's been trained to do			1
at the same time , i 'm terrified because to do that [ surfing ] would be my worst nightmare so i 'm relieved he came through it ok			0
' @entity6 , a professional surfer and part time lifeguard from @entity54 in @entity55 , successfully completed his attempt on the 80ft behemoth			1
but his colleague , fellow surfer , @entity58 was n't so lucky			2
the @entity59 was knocked unconscious by a wave and had to be pulled from the surf and given cpr			0
after being rushed to hospital , it was later revealed that she had suffered a broken leg in the incident			0
@entity20 , who knows the risks her husband takes when he goes into the water , says that she 's always relieved when she hears the phone ring and his voice on the other end after one of his surfing exploits			1
' as soon as the phone rings and i know he 's on dry land , i 'm ok , ' she explains			2
' that 's all i care about - for me , all about getting the phone call			2
' despite being left on the edge of her seat by his exploits , @entity20 says she ca n't imagine him doing anything else and is completely supportive of his choices			1
family man : @entity6 cuddles up to @entity90 ( left ) and with his children on the beach in @entity14 ( right ) proud : @entity20 says she is thrilled about her husband 's incredible achievement and can not wait to see him again ' he 's been surfing since before i met him , ' she explains			1
' i 'm completely supportive because it 's who he is - he 's totally driven and he 's following his heart			1
' when not doing it , he 's a little bit of a lost soul even if it does mean pushing boundaries , so as far as i 'm concerned , good on him			0
' it 's terrifying for me but he 's doing the right thing by himself			0
' @entity20 , who was at home bracing herself against @entity110 's storm while her husband made his attempt , might be supportive of @entity6 's efforts but admits she might not feel the same if one of her children , honey , six , or @entity32 , one , decided to follow in their father 's footsteps			1
' i 'd just have to laugh , ' she chuckles			0
' doing it myself is actually , literally my worst nightmare ! being a wife and having a husband doing it is tough but having child do it would be even harder			2
' [ @entity6 's ] mum is incredible			1
' in the meantime , music teacher @entity20 is looking forward to welcoming her adventurous husband home to @entity55 in a few days time			1
' i really am looking forward to it , ' she says			0
' i want to say well done and give him a huge hug			0
he 's done absolutely brilliantly and after working so hard and doing so much training			0
' he 's following his dreams and i 'm just so proud			2
' death - defying : @entity6 tackles one of the 80ft waves blown up by the @entity110 's storm on monday incredible : @entity6 was supported by two jetskis during his feat and trained for months before attempting it ' sometimes i think these daredevil people should die			1
there was warning about the weather			0
obviously they did n't care			0
just to rescue them , at least few emergency people were engaged			0
when they could have saved older or genuine emergency cases			0
' - @entity152 , @entity153 ' speechless ! @entity155 is @entity156 , and @entity6 looks like such a normal good lad ... keep the photos coming ! ! - @entity159 , @entity153 ' " @entity163 [ sic ] @entity162 " especialy [ sic ] putting the lives of would be rescuers at @entity161			2
' - @entity165 , @entity166 ' amazing photos ! as for people criticising , yes , it may have been " irresponsible " , but i 'm pretty sure most people who take part in water sports / extreme sports are aware of the risks ... it 's their choice if they choose to take them doing something that they enjoy			2
' @entity182 , @entity183 ' a man with two young children risking his life for an adrenaline rush ... time to grow up you selfish idiot			0
' - @entity190 , @entity191 ' crazy people , but the thrill of riding those huge waves in stormy weather must be amazing			1
trouble is , other people could end up drowning trying to rescue them			0
' @entity199 , @entity200 ' what an unbelievably selfish & irresponsible so - called father ! ' - @entity202 , @entity203 ' wow ! great to have an @entity205 bloke out there amongst of all the usual @entity207 and @entity208 surfers			2
' - @entity209 , @entity153			0
