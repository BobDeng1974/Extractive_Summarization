by @entity0 published : 13:42 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 14:41 est , 26 june 2013 appeal : @entity2 , who appeared at the tribunal via video - link , wants to be transferred from @entity6 secure hospital back to prison to die the astonishing £ 300,000 a year cost of keeping @entity9 in a secure hospital was highlighted yesterday as a key reason to send him back to jail			1
lawyers for the @entity15 said he was merely ‘ an elderly , socially isolated man talking to the television ’			0
they complained the killer had been ‘ tired ’ during his self - glorifying four - hour testimony to his mental health tribunal on tuesday and accused the authorities of treating him as a ‘ special case ’ by denying him his wish to die in jail			1
the annual bill for keeping the 75 - year - old at @entity6 on @entity27 is almost eight times the £ 40,000 cost for a jail place			0
the difference is accounted for mainly by the army of medical staff			0
despite accommodating no more than 228 patients , @entity6 employs 937 staff , with an annual running cost of £ 67million			0
that includes 11 consultants and 649 nursing staff along with psychiatrists and psychologists , social workers , occupational therapists , teachers , physical health care staff , chaplains , cooks and cleaners , quite apart from security staff			0
relatives of the five children murdered by @entity2 and @entity51 in the 1960s have said the money would be better spent tracing the remains of @entity55 , which have never been found			1
in closing submissions yesterday to the tribunal , which itself is costing £ 250,000 , his barrister , @entity60 , said he suffered from a ‘ static ’ personality disorder rather than mental illness and argued there was ‘ no therapeutic benefit ’ in keeping him in hospital			1
she said the psychosis which resulted in @entity2 ’s transfer from prison in 1985 had not returned , and claimed episodes psychiatrists had classed as hallucinations were no more than ‘ an elderly , socially isolated man talking to the television ’			1
faces of evil : @entity2 and his accomplice @entity51 , pictured in police mugshots after their capture during his evidence on tuesday @entity2 , who is seeking to be moved back to a normal prison , referred to his killings as ‘ existential ’ and ‘ recreational ’			1
but miss @entity83 said his ‘ refusal to accept blame ’ , ‘ lack of empathy ’ and ‘ sense of grandiosity ’ could be explained by personality disorders which could be addressed in prison			0
he would also have been tired from giving evidence at the end of a long tribunal , she added			0
the killer also refused to accept that by eating toast and soup he was no longer meaningfully on the hunger strike he began in 1999 , a stance @entity83 put down to wanting to avoid ‘ loss of face ’			2
@entity6 in @entity27 : @entity2 , who has been kept in the high security unit since 1985 , has already been told he will never be considered for release even if he does succeed in being sent back to prison she also highlighted previous press reports that @entity2 had a penchant for @entity108 as an example of how his life at @entity6 was susceptible to leaks			2
miss @entity83 argued that @entity6 was treating @entity2 as ‘ a special case ’ , questioning whether it had been ‘ drawn into a battle ’ with him and ‘ lost perspective ’			1
‘ is he to be kept for ever in hospital at massive public expense because of the possibility of a relapse despite more than two decades without one ? ’ she asked			0
victims : @entity55 , whose body has never been recovered , left , and @entity122 , right , were two of the youngsters killed by @entity126 murderer @entity9 during the 1960s lured to their deaths : @entity2 and his partner @entity51 killed @entity9 , left , in october 1965			2
@entity131 , right , 16 , disappeared on her way to a disco on july 12 , 1963 @entity134 , for @entity6 , however , said @entity2 continued to suffer ‘ chronic ’ mental illness for which he refused therapy , adding that ‘ the nature of the case of untreated schizophrenia is that it does not vanish ’			1
miss @entity140 also said @entity2 had not given a ‘ cogent ’ reason for why he wanted to return to prison , instead telling anecdotes about being locked up in the 1960s with other notorious criminals			1
judge @entity146 said the panel hoped to announce its decision by the end of the week			0
along with @entity51 – who died in 2002 – @entity2 murdered @entity131 , 16 , @entity122 , 12 , @entity55 , 12 , @entity150 , ten , and @entity9 , 17 , between 1963 and 1965			2
victims were lured to their deaths , sexually tortured then buried on @entity153 above @entity154 .			0

@entity2 *'s* legal team accuses authorities of making the killer a ' special case '
but lawyers for the hospital insist his mental illness is *incurable*
they put his desire to return to jail down to *nostalgia*
