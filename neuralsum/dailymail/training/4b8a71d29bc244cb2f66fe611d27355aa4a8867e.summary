high - tech ' fight cameras ' which can automatically alert police when violence is about to break out on busy streets are being developed by @entity5 scientists			1
the crime - fighting cctv system will use sophisticated software to predict when a fight will happen - by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert as fists are about to fly			1
police say the the groundbreaking surveillance technology could help them detect crime ' before it happens ' - much like the pre-crime unit featured in the @entity16 sci - fi film @entity17			2
scientists at @entity19 have developed a futuristic @entity6 system ( stock image shown )			1
it can alert police when a fight is about to break out			1
it does this by analysing crowd movements and triggering an alert			1
the project is only in development at the moment but could help reduce the number of violent crimes the million - pound project to develop the smart cameras is believed to be a world first in using @entity6 to analyse people 's behaviour in public			1
in december it was announced police in @entity41 are considering adopting a similar software that predicts crimes and is named ‘ @entity44 ’ - in a nod to the sci - fi film			2
developed by the institute for pattern - based @entity49 in @entity50 , the software programme predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur , based on different sets of data			0
it is being tested by police in the southern state of @entity58			0
the @entity41 @entity44 system relies on data of the location , time and other details of past crimes , such as home break - ins			1
when a new incident is reported , the software analyses the data to look for a pattern that will point to a future target			0
developed by scientists at the @entity76 at @entity19 , the imaging technology alerts @entity6 operators and police officers when fights are detected on city centre cameras			1
' developing smart camera technology that can pinpoint violence is a really cost effective way of helping police to do their jobs , ' said professor @entity82			0
' officers ca n't monitor hundreds of city centre cctv cameras all the time			0
' by using imaging technology , officers will be alerted to violence hotspots in real - time , helping to further reduce violence			0
' it 's a great way of using technology to make the streets safer for all of us			0
' it comes amid a surge in violent crime in @entity96 and @entity97 , with the number of incidents soaring by 16 per cent to nearly 700,000 incidents in figures released last month			1
according to @entity104 estimates , the average violence incident costs more than £ 33,000 ( $ 50,700 ) , including @entity105 and criminal justice costs and lost working hours			0
police say the the ground - breaking surveillance technology could help them detect crime ' before it happens ' - much like the pre-crime unit featured in the 2002 @entity16 sci - fi film @entity17 ( shown ) @entity111 , chief constable of @entity113 and @entity115 spokesman on alcohol and licensing , said the @entity6 system would ' hopefully identify ways to automatically predict potential disorder in the night time economy so we can deploy officers to it before it happens			1
' he added : ' as austerity continues in policing it is important that we work together with academia to develop an evidence base of knowledge to ensure officers and resources are deployed as effectively as possible			0
' the project team is working to develop a fool - proof system which can operate at night - when most street fights take place - and recognise the complex behaviour of people in a crowd			2
' detecting violence from @entity6 camera footage presents some interesting technical challenges due to the time of day , the need to operate in all weather conditions , camera positions and recognising people 's often complex activities in such footage , ' said professor @entity150 , from the university 's @entity151			2
the project is a partnership between @entity19 , @entity155 and the @entity156			2
@entity155 is developing the technological infrastructure , whilst the @entity156 is providing funding .			0
