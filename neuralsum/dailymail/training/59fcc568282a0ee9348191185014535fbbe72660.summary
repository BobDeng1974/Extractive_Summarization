the @entity0 are in a stand - off with politicians over releasing sensitive information from secret files into the doomed 2018 @entity7 @entity6 bid			1
former minister of sport @entity8 revealed that the @entity0 had ‘ reluctantly ’ agreed to show some members of the @entity11 , @entity12 , sport select committee the dossier of documents which @entity16 intelligence services help to compile			1
and former @entity0 chairman @entity17 said the @entity18 would be the ‘ rightful judges ’ of the hidden cache of material - much of it rumour , hearsay and innuendo rather than hard facts			2
former @entity0 chairman @entity17 failed to lead @entity7 to hosting either the 2018 @entity6 the @entity0 want guarantees of confidentiality plus notice of what the select committee members intend to do with documents , containing mainly unsubstantiated information , before handing them over			1
they want to avoid costly legal action such as @entity17 still faces from abroad after making allegations about @entity6 bid corruption under parliamentary privilege			0
detail from those secret files that could be properly corroborated have already been handed over to @entity40 investigator @entity39			0
@entity7 head coach @entity41 wants the @entity43 roof kept open for the titanic @entity45 opener against @entity46 in @entity47 on friday night			0
in contrast , the roof will be closed for all eight @entity50 games there in the autumn to ensure a level playing field for all teams			0
@entity55 , president of the @entity0 , is adamant about a gentlemen ’s agreement between the @entity57 , in place from 2011 , that the @entity16 vice-presidency on the @entity60 should rotate and it is @entity46 ’s turn after @entity63 , of @entity64 , steps down in may			1
however , @entity55 can not count on the support of the @entity66 on this issue			0
they , like the @entity0 who have put up @entity73 as a candidate , believe that any such verbal contract was dissolved when new @entity77 statutes were introduced which have all 54 @entity69 countries voting on the next @entity16 representative rather than just the @entity57			1
@entity63 ( left ) will step down from the @entity16 vice-presidency on the @entity60 in may @entity79 ca n’t use the excuse of being strapped for cash after it emerged they put in a losing bid of £ 10million - a - year for the five - year @entity86 golf contract			1
that gives them a £ 50m war chest to invest in another rights property — probably best spent shoring up their precious hold on @entity45 rugby who will accept pay - tv bids in the next tender from 2018			0
testing times for @entity98 the @entity79 signing @entity98 as a @entity101 pundit looks fraught with problems with arch - enemy @entity103 also on the @entity105 team and cricket correspondent @entity106 having had spats with @entity98			1
however , it ’s understood @entity98 will not be scheduled to do the same games as @entity103 after being loaned to @entity105 by @entity110 — who made the approach — for short commentary spells from the quarter - finals onwards			2
@entity103 described @entity98 ’s autobiography as ‘ the biggest work of fiction since @entity118 ’			1
@entity105 producer @entity105 is known to have checked with @entity106 before agreeing to the @entity98 offer			2
@entity106 had resigned from @entity121 temporarily last october after a social media row with @entity98 ’s wife @entity123 in the fall - out from the publication of @entity98 ’s life story			2
but @entity106 is said to be relaxed at having @entity98 briefly as a @entity105 colleague			2
former @entity7 captain @entity98 has joined the @entity129 special commentary team the 34 - year - old and four - time @entity132 winner will be on air from the competition 's quarter - finals onwards such is the chaos within the @entity137 during a mass culling of personnel - especially those aged more than 50 - that new chief executive @entity141 has had to start work at @entity143 with an acting , acting director of communications in @entity146 because the current acting comms chief @entity147 is on paternity leave			1
it ’s almost a year since @entity150 announced his @entity152 franchise in @entity153 — but there ’s still no stadium site in place , or much other progress , it seems			0
however , the @entity150 camp are still confident they will have a set of partners , a ground - likely to be at @entity153 ’s renovated @entity161 at first - and a name for the team by the end of march			0
the project is currently called @entity166 but there ’s no chance of @entity150 ’s name being included in the official @entity152 team name			0
an artist 's impression of how @entity153 's proposed 25,000 capacity new build stadium would look like			0

@entity0 want guarantees of confidentiality about their documents
dossier will be compiled with the help of @entity16 intelligence services
@entity98 will work as a @entity79 @entity101 pundit
