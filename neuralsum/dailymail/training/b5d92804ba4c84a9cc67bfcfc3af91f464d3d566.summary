by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 11:47 est , 28 november 2012 early in the morning , just as day is dawning , he picks up all the postbags in his van ... but now , the postman is banned from delivering to one particular housing estate due to fears he might trip over			2
overzealous @entity11 health and safety officers have ruled that the uneven paving slabs on two roads in @entity14 , @entity15 , are too dangerous for their postmen to negotiate			1
if they want to get their mail , residents of @entity18 and @entity19 will be forced to make a six - mile round trip in order to collect their letters , parcels and postcards from the nearest depot and carry them home themselves			1
a bump in the road : @entity11 refuse to deliver letters to some houses in @entity14 because of the health and safety risk posed by uneven paving slabs like these ' @entity33 ' : this pathway is considered by officials to be too treacherous for a postman to traverse do it yourself : pensioners will be forced - along with other residents - to make a six - mile round trip to get their mail rather than make postmen face walking over these wobbly stones and the situation wo n't change unless families living on the road pay out to repair the wonky stones that have been deemed so hazardous			1
residents are furious at the decision , and have called the move - which has come at one of the busiest times of year for post - ' madness '			1
student @entity54 , 19 , who lives on @entity18 , said : ' it feels like @entity11 are persecuting the people who live here			1
' it 's not our fault the paths are a little uneven in places but that 's life			0
' we all cope with the paths , we 're not kept prisoners in our homes too scared to venture out in case we trip over so why should @entity11 be so worried ? ' it 's just madness			1
' another resident , @entity70 , 49 , went further , describing it as just one more example of ' health and safety gone mad			0
' he said : ' we have elderly residents who manage the stones fine , so why ca n’t these fit and healthy posties do the same ? it ’s not like anyone has injured themselves			1
how can @entity84 be expected to travel six miles every day just to pick up their letters ? ' elderly local @entity86 , 83 , agreed			0
' i ’m expecting letters from the hospital so i ’ve had to ask a lady around the corner to pick up my post for me			0
i ’ve been here 26 years			0
' if i can manage the flagstones , i ’m sure the postman can			0
' quite a distance : the lengthy route from @entity18 to the @entity98 depot that residents will now have to take frustrating : a copy of the letters the postman did deliver - telling residents their service would be ending			2
right , student @entity54 , who feels the @entity11 is ' persecuting ' the people of the area residents have found themselves at a stand - off with @entity11 over how to deal with the damaged pavements			1
many people living in the area are short - term renters such as students and nurses rather than homeowners , and are unwilling or unable to pay for the work out of their own pockets			1
this has left many of those affected with the task of tracking down landlords to try and persuade them to invest in the repairs			0
@entity126 , 69 , who has lived at his property for 28 years , said : ' nothing has been done to the paving slabs because some of the property owners rent their houses so it is difficult to find out who they are			2
' it will be down to a few people who live here and own their properties to do something and it will be too expensive			0
but mr @entity126 has come up with one initiative to tackle the problem - erecting his own postbox on another street			1
stand - off : many people living in the area are short - term renters such as students and nurses rather than homeowners , and unwilling to pay for repairs out of their own pockets he said : ' i have put a postbox on the other side of my house away from the slabs and asked a manager if they can put any post in there and i am waiting for an answer			1
' a spokesman for @entity11 said : ' we have temporarily suspended deliveries because of the very poor state of the pavements in the area			1
' we previously raised our concerns with residents about the safety risk because the pavements are their responsibility , but to date these have n’t been addressed			2
' we carried out a further risk assessment last week and the paving clearly posed a safety risk			0
' our delivery staff have been injured in very similar circumstances and as we have a duty of care we are not prepared to compromise on safety			0
' we are keen to resume deliveries to these addresses as soon as improvements are made to the pavements			0
' the affected residents have been advised to check their property deeds or consult the @entity187			2
@entity188 , of @entity189 , said : ' it is the responsibility of the landowner to ensure the roads and pavements are maintained to a safe standard			0
' poor service : dozens of families and elderly people living on @entity18 and @entity19 will now go without any postal deliveries until they pay for the repairs taking initiative : locals have attempted to work around the post ban by offering postmen alternative places to leave letters , or in the case of resident @entity126 , erecting their own postboxes on neighbouring streets			2

@entity11 *insists* homeowners must pay to repair the cracked slabs out of their own pockets
residents call it ' madness ' and one has erected his own postbox on another street
