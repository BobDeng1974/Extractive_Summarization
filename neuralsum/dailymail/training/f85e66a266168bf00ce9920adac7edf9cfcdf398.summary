towards the end of his press conference at @entity3 on tuesday , @entity0 was asked by a presenter from children ’s television whether he thought youngsters in @entity8 should be allowed to stay up for the game against @entity10			1
@entity11 can be an obtuse man but on this he was unequivocal			2
‘ i would always allow my children to watch the match because this is absolutely unique , ’ said the @entity8 coach			2
look at the impact of the @entity17 at a global level — and this is a semi-final			2
eye to eye : @entity0 and @entity21 talk in training rallying cry : @entity11 has called on the @entity25 public to ramp up their support @entity28 hopeful on @entity30 fitness ‘ most children are on holiday and they wo n’t sleep anyway because they will be so stressed and tense			1
i would strongly advise parents to let them watch the match			2
’ in @entity8 , they are just glad to have these decisions to make			2
this was supposed to be a @entity17 of limited horizons for @entity11 and his functional ( his own word ) team			2
yet , here we are and the @entity25 are still in town , preparing for a classic fixture to conjure memories of the 1978 final — won by @entity10 in their own country — and a 1998 quarter - final — won by @entity8 in @entity47			1
those games , of course , featured defining contributions by genuine superstars			2
@entity52 scored the opening goal in @entity54 and @entity55 settled the meeting in @entity57 with perhaps the best goal of his stellar career in the final minute			1
on wednesday night in mild , damp @entity60 , we have the opportunity to witness greatness once again			2
non-flying @entity25 : @entity55 scores against @entity10 in 1998 decisive blow : @entity55 scored the second as @entity8 ran out 2 - 1 winners in @entity47 the deposed @entity66 , @entity67 , has approached this tournament in @entity69 as if intent on proving people were wrong to give this year ’s title to @entity73			1
so far , he has done a pretty reasonable job and without him @entity10 would certainly no longer be here			0
even @entity67 , though , would struggle to shift @entity8 ’s @entity75 as player of the tournament in most people ’s minds			1
the @entity81 forward has taken his game to new levels in @entity84 and it is perhaps not surprising that @entity10 appear to be approaching this game with some rather rudimentary ideas about how to stop him			0
warning : @entity75 has been told to expect a rough ride against @entity10 juggling skills : @entity75 looked relaxed in training on tuesday ahead of the big game ‘ we have to be aggressive , to show the passion of the @entity98 players to the @entity25 — and especially to @entity75 , ’ said @entity94 defender @entity93			1
‘ he does n’t like physical contact , so you have to make him feel it and get under his skin			0
he is a phenomenon but he ’s not got much edge , he ’s not a fighter			0
therefore you have to attack him			0
’ @entity93 and @entity75 played together at @entity81 in 2009 - 10			1
maybe the @entity84 has n’t been watching his old club mate closely out here , though , as the @entity75 of summer 2014 has shown as much courage as any forward in this tournament			1
last saturday , four of @entity111 ’s back five were booked for crude , hacking fouls on @entity75			1
still , he strode forward			0
no nonsense : @entity93 says @entity8 are in for some tough treatment if @entity10 are to stop him on wednesday night in @entity60 , they will need to find a cuter way			1
‘ it ’s ridiculous how much he is fouled , ’ said @entity25 midfielder @entity118			1
‘ they foul him because they ca n’t find another way			0
he is too good for most			0
’ it may seem rich to hear members of @entity8 ’s derided 2010 @entity17 final team moan about treatment afforded one of their own , given the way @entity130 and others kicked the @entity132 midfield all over @entity133 four years ago			1
certainly , they will seek other ways to neutralise @entity67			1
@entity11 ’s @entity8 are different in their approach from the team shaped by @entity139 and on tuesday the current manager did his best to play down questions about @entity143 ’s magician			1
‘ we are playing against @entity10 and we always refer to teams and not individual players , ’ said @entity11			0
@entity147 man : @entity8 will have to stop @entity98 ace @entity67 @entity148 : @entity67 highlights ‘ we have a plan ready for @entity10			1
we showed the players @entity10 this morning			0
@entity67 was once elected best footballer in the world			1
there ’s a reason for that			0
if you score so many goals , you have an added value			0
‘ at the most important stage he can always pull it off but in principle he ’s always found it difficult to show that at an international level			0
he wants to do that at this tournament and we want to stop him doing that , so that ’s going to be quite a challenge			0
’ @entity25 training contained some surprises on tuesday as @entity130 , struggling with a groin injury , joined in the session and captain @entity21 , who had a stomach bug , did not			1
concern : @entity30 sat out the full session due to a stomach problem @entity177 : @entity8 highlights we can expect the latter to start , however , and he is already looking ahead beyond the match			2
‘ playing against @entity10 is not a dream , ’ said @entity30			0
‘ it does n’t interest me at all			0
we just have to win			0
a dream is to grab hold of that cup			0
‘ the other semi-final is @entity69 - @entity188 so we ’ll see who we ’ll play next weekend			0
’ @entity25 confidence is clearly high			1
parents in @entity192 and beyond should perhaps start planning ahead .			0

@entity195 star more interested in who @entity25 could meet in the final
@entity0 wary of *threat* posed by @entity143 star @entity67
@entity93 warns @entity75 to expect some tough treatment
