by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:05 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 10:31 est , 2 january 2014 @entity3 today hit back at critics of government - backed mortgages , insisting he was helping people without wealthy parents to ' realise their dreams ' of owning their own home			1
more than 100 people every working day are buying new homes under the government 's help to buy scheme , new figures show			1
the prime minister announced that 6,000 applicants have applied for a mortgage using the scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since chancellor @entity21 unveiled the plans			1
life - changing : @entity3 has a cup of tea with @entity25 and her daughter @entity26 , 2 , during a visit to her home in @entity29 , @entity30 which she has bought through the government 's help to buy scheme dream : mr @entity3 said the government wanted to help more people to buy their own homes officials say that will mean a total of £ 910million in extra lending to those trying to get on the housing ladder or trade up to a larger property			1
the prime minister hailed the scheme as evidence that the government has been able to help those who can afford a mortgage but did not previously have the money to put down a deposit			2
and he hit back at critics like business secretary @entity54 who warn that help to buy is contributing to another house price boom			1
speaking on a visit to @entity29 , mr @entity3 said : ' where we are today , house prices are still way below the peak they reached in 2007			1
' forecasters do not think they will get back to the level before the crash even in 2019			0
so there is no evidence of a problem			0
' this is about helping people to achieve the security and stability they want of owning a flat or a home of their own			2
' we are not helping people to buy flats or homes they can not afford			2
we are helping people who do not have wealthy parents , who can not get a big deposit together , and helping them to realise their dreams			2
' bubble : on a visit to a new housing development in @entity29 , the prime minister brushed aside fears that the help to buy scheme was fuelling a new property price boom experts are already predicting house price rises of between 8 and 10 per cent next year , pushing property further out of reach for millions			1
mr @entity54 said last month that the government should ‘ look again ’ at the help to buy scheme , which he blames for a ‘ raging housing boom ’ in @entity98 and the @entity99			1
he warned that if the @entity101 does not raise interest rates it might ‘ get out of control ’ and mean that ‘ the only people who can live in large parts of @entity98 are foreigners and bankers			2
we do n’t want that ’			0
under the scheme , people with a deposit of 5 per cent can get mortgages that are usually only available to those with a deposit of 20 per cent , because the government underwrites the risk to the mortgage lenders			1
but @entity117 insisted that help to buy supports ‘ responsible lending ’			2
three quarters of @entity118 to buy mortgage applications came from outside @entity98 and the @entity99 and eight out of ten were from first time buyers			0
on average households are looking to buy homes worth £ 160,000 , below the @entity127 average house price of £ 247,000			1
split : chancellor @entity21 unveiled the help to buy scheme three months ago but business secretary @entity54 has warned it risks fuelling a new house price bubble no 10 said applicants will face average monthly repayments of around £ 900 and have an annual household income of around £ 45,000 , making their mortgage payments 23 per cent of their gross income			1
mr @entity3 added : ‘ @entity137 is often a time when people look to make those big life - changing decisions like moving home or taking that first step on the housing ladder			1
‘ but too many people have found themselves frozen out of the market in recent years as a result of the size of the deposit required			2
‘ that is why as part of our long - term economic plan we introduced the help to buy scheme , so hardworking people with sufficient earnings can get on , fulfil their aspirations and enjoy the security of owning their own home			1
‘ in less than three months , the scheme has already helped thousands of people			1
i want to see that continue in 2014 and for help to buy to help thousands more realise their dream of home ownership			0
’ in just 12 weeks since the scheme launched , nearly 750 homeowners have completed their purchases and hundreds were able to spend @entity172 in their new homes			2
@entity174 , her partner @entity174 and her six year old son @entity176 , declared help to buy ‘ a miracle ’ after she was able to buy her dream home			0
‘ after a hard few years saving , our dream property came onto the market , we viewed it , fell in love with it , then had to come to terms with the fact that we could n’t raise enough money for a deposit on a mortgage , ’ she said			0
‘ just when we had given up hope , help to buy became available , which was a miracle for us , it made it possible for us to afford the mortgage deposit			0
only one week after our first viewing , we put in an offer , which was accepted and 5 weeks later we moved in			0
’ six thousand applicants have applied for a mortgage using the help to buy scheme at a rate of 500 a week in the three months since chancellor @entity21 unveiled the plans @entity206 , a father of twins aged one and his partner moved into their new home in @entity211 at the start of december			1
he said : ‘ the help to buy scheme has given us the opportunity to get onto the property ladder			0
without this we would have still been renting and buying would n’t have been possible , due to the large deposits			0
it was great to enjoy @entity172 as a family in our own home			0
’ @entity223 and @entity224 will introduce their own help to buy products onto the market this month , joining @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 who have all launched products over the last three months			0
an additional 20,000 households have also been supported by separate equity loan scheme , also called help to buy , in which the government provides an interest - free loan to support the purchase of a newly built home			0
@entity243 sources confirmed that mr @entity54 remains ‘ sceptical ’ about the scheme			1
@entity245 , @entity246 's shadow housing ninister , said : ' any help for first time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder is to be welcomed			0
' but rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply if this scheme is to bring the cost of housing within the reach of low and middle income earners			0
' you ca n't deal with the cost - of - living crisis without building more homes			0
