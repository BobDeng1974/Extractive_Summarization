with @entity3 suffering from non-hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 23 , having a heart attack in 2006 and finally suffering a cancer relapse three years later , their relationship has been tested to its limit			1
and with exercise and dieting the last things on their mind , the two found they were piling on the pounds too			2
when @entity3 was given the all clear from cancer in 2009 and released from hospital , the pounds just kept creeping on			1
but now the couple have decided to battle against the weight - and each other - and have now lost over 7st each - using their wii fit machine			1
thanks to making some simple changes to their diet and regular routines on the @entity27 and dance games , the couple have lost over 7 stone each - but @entity2 has lost 3lbs more @entity2 and @entity3 started piling on the pounds after @entity3 was released from hospital having suffered from cancer @entity2 has got the edge thanks to putting in the extra hours on the @entity27 after their three children had gone to bed , and has lost three pounds more than @entity3			1

' it made it fun - and we had something to prove			0
' i started using the @entity27 because i did n't want to end up with excess skin , so i 've been doing yoga and playing the dance games with the girls to tone up			0
