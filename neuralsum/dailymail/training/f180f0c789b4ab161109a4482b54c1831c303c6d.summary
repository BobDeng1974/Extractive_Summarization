by @entity0 @entity1 confessed to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother			1
he told his psychiatrist two years after @entity5 , 74 , died he had smothered her - and had been consumed with guilt ever since a man has avoided jail after he tried to murder his terminally ill mother by smothering her with a pillow in an act of attempted euthanasia			1
@entity1 , 50 , from @entity13 , @entity14 , pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of 74 - year - old @entity5			1
a court heard how mrs @entity5 had been diagnosed with lung cancer and was admitted to the @entity18 , @entity19 , in march 2011 when her condition worsened			1
mrs @entity5 died on april 2			1
doctors assumed she had passed away naturally and her death certificate recorded the cause as a small valve obstruction and cancer			2
however , two years later @entity1 confessed to a psychiatrist he had smothered his mother and he had been ' consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her ' ever since			1
the police were called in and mr @entity1 was charged with attempted murder as there was no medical evidence that he actually caused her death , despite his admission			1
he was sentenced at @entity37 to a two - year prison term , suspended for 18 months , today			1
the court heard how , on 29 march 2011 , mrs @entity5 , whose cancer had spread and was in a great deal of pain , was admitted to hospital and was expected to die within a couple of days			1
seeing her suffering in pain , mr @entity1 asked a nurse if there was anything they ‘ could do ’ for her and was told they could only make her comfortable			0
the nurse made a note of his request in the log at 8pm on april 2 , 2011			2
mrs @entity5 died on the same evening			2
following her death @entity1 became depressed and attempted to commit suicide			0
he also had professional help from a psychiatrist - to whom he made his confession			0
@entity57 , senior crown prosecutor for the @entity58 in @entity59 , told the court how , although it could not be proven @entity1 had killed his mother , his confession was enough for a prosecution			0
he said : ' this is a very sad case , where a son admitted carrying out an act that amounted to the attempted murder of his terminally ill mother because he could not bear seeing her suffering			2
' as distressing as it is to see a loved one suffering and dying from cancer or a terminal illness , it is not for a person to decide when someone should die			0
euthanasia is effectively murder and murder is a crime			0
' the court heard how @entity5 , 74 , was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 2010 and that the prognosis was that she had not long to live			0
' on march 29 2011 she was admitted to @entity18 after her condition worsened			0
her cancer had spread elsewhere in her body and she was in great pain			0
mrs @entity5 was admitted to @entity18 , pictured , in march 2011 with only days to live			1
she died on april 2 - with doctors believing she passed away from natural causes ' it was felt by her consultant that she would not benefit from surgical intervention ; she was to be kept as comfortable as possible as her death was inevitable			1
' the nurse in attendance at the time entered in her log book that mrs @entity5 ’s 50 - year - old son @entity96 was at her side and asked the nurse to help his mother as she was in great pain			1
mrs @entity5 was given morphine and midazolam			2
' mr @entity1 asked the nurse if there was anything he could do , and the nurse told him that they could only make her comfortable and the only thing he needed to do was to be on her side when she eventually passed away			0
mrs @entity5 died on the evening of april 2 2011			1
' mr @entity1 started to see a psychiatrist as following the death of his mother he suffered from depression			0
' on two occasions he tried to commit suicide and he seriously injured himself by jumping from the window of his fourth floor flat			0
on february 21 2013 he confessed to this psychiatrist he was consumed with guilt after killing his mother by suffocating her			2
' he then called the police who arrested him			0
he made the same confession to the police after declining to have a solicitor			0
' after a careful and thorough review of all the evidence in this case , i decided that there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to charge mr @entity1 with an offence of attempted murder , an offence that he pleaded guilty to on february 21 2014			1
' mrs @entity5 ’s consultant said that her death was inevitable and it was therefore not possible for the prosecution to prove that her son had actually killed her			2
' however it was possible to prove that he attempted to do so , based on his own admission			0
