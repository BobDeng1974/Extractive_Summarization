' they were bound to this by something called a juju ritual			1

the woman , who like her fellow victim can not be named for legal reasons , said she had stopped working and changed her sim card so @entity9 could not contact her			1
however , within a month she received a phone call from her mother in @entity12			0
' i had a call from my mum who told me @entity171 's people had been to her house and threatened her , ' the victim told the jury			0

she told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked			2
' it was only when i told them i was trafficked into the country that i found out they were trafficked , ' she said			2
@entity9 , who is heavily pregnant , said she made an oath with her trafficker before leaving @entity12 and was forced to eat the roast heart of a cockerel			1
trial : a jury at @entity50 ( pictured ) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial she said : ' i would n't do the things they say i did because i 've been through it			2
' the jury was told that cash payments of several hundred pounds a time had been deposited into @entity10 's account from locations all over the country , including @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			1
he had claimed that money came from his friend			2
' i am the kind of person who likes clothes and shoes and i 'm known for that - i like to find bargains , ' he said			0
' it is not that it is any fraud money or anything			2
my account has not been used for anything like that			0
' during an interview with police , he said : ' i am here to say i do not even know the people you are talking about - i have never seen them			0
' i have never involved myself in that kind of activity in this country , even before this country			0
i have not and i would not , ' he had claimed			0
@entity239 , representing @entity10 , of @entity131 , said : ' since coming to this country , he has demonstrated a willingness to work honestly			1
' but judge @entity27 said he was ' certain ' that @entity10 knew the money was illegal and where it was coming from			1
@entity9 was convicted of a total of eight counts including trafficking two women into and around the @entity2 , inciting them to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property			1

both were remanded in custody today to be sentenced next month , but judge @entity255 warned them they will face lengthy custodial sentences			2
speaking after the verdicts had been given , ms @entity91 said : ' this was a despicable and callous crime			0
' these two defendants were involved in an elaborate deception , taking advantage of cultural and financial issues in order to gain a devastating hold over their vulnerable victims			2
' once the victims had entered the @entity2 , they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner			0
human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society			0
' i hope today 's convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law			0
' it took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal			0
i hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position			0
' whilst we can not undo what has already happened to these victims , we can hope that today 's convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal			0
' a spokesman for the @entity297 , which led the investigation , said : ' trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today 's society but , as this case has shown , it is taking place here			0
' that is why we are taking action on a number of fronts			0
' we are working with law enforcement overseas , the law is being strengthened and the @entity311 , one of the first of its kind in the world , will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims			1
