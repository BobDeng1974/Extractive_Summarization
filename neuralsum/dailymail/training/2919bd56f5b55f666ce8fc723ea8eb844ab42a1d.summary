the mother of a brain - dead pregnant @entity2 woman being kept alive by a ventilator has joined her son - in - law 's calls to end life support			1
@entity7 says she was shocked to learn her state left the family powerless to carry out their daughter @entity10 's wish to never be dependent on a ventilator because she is pregnant			1
now @entity14 is lashing out against a @entity16 law she says has put her family through ‘ pure hell			1
’ tragedy : @entity20 found @entity21 on the kitchen floor in late november			1
she 'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain			0
she was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness ‘ the doctors told us that even if a pregnant woman has a dnr or a living will , the law supersedes that , ’ @entity14 told @entity33			1
in @entity16 , doctors must take all life saving measures to preserve the life of an unborn baby			2
that ’s even if , as in this case , the fetus is too immature to survive outside the mother			2
‘ my jaw hit the ground , ’ said @entity14 , who hopes to go before the @entity16 legislature to petition them to change the law			2
it was just the beginning of a hellish holiday season for @entity14 and her family , one that began two days before @entity52 when @entity14 ’s son - in - law @entity53 found @entity10 unconscious on the kitchen floor			1
questions : in @entity16 , state law stipulates that , in cases of pregnant women , @entity57 do not apply and all measures must be taken to save the life of the fetus			1
meanwhile , it remains unclear how the fetus was affected when @entity10 's brain was deprived of oxygen for an extended period normal heartbeat : for now , the baby in @entity10 's womb has a normal heartbeat and could still potentially be carried to full term happier times : @entity53 ( right , holding their 1 - year - old son @entity73 ) says his wife @entity10 ( left ) did not want to ever be kept alive with a machine			1
but because she is pregnant , @entity16 law requires she receive all life saving measures @entity20 is a paramedic — as was @entity10 — and immediately performed @entity80 , but it was no use			1
at 14 weeks pregnant with their second child , @entity10 had been without oxygen for an hour			1
‘ they did a @entity87 scan and an eeg and there was no brain activity , ’ @entity14 said			0
‘ she was clinically declared brain dead			0
@entity10 had suffered what was likely an embolism			0
she has been unconscious ever since and remains on a ventilator			0
now 18 weeks into her pregnancy , the family has no idea whether the child sustained severe damage while deprived of oxygen			1
all they know is that they are powerless over their daughter ’s fate or that of the unborn fetus			0
' knowing our daughter is not there , but her body is being kept alive , is hard to see , ' @entity14 told @entity111			0
@entity10 must remain on life support until she miscarries the fetus or until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks			1
‘ at that point they would decide whether to start labor , do a c - section , or see if she could go to 34 or 36 weeks when the fetus would be full term , ’ @entity14 said			2
but she and her family are horrified things even got this far			0
‘ no family should have to go through this , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s been pure hell			0
’ neither @entity14 nor her son - in - law have looked into hiring a lawyer and @entity14 says it will be about a month before they know what the next step will be			2
for now , the family is in total agreement			0
‘ i do n't agree with this law , ’ @entity53 told @entity136 as he sadly browsed old photos of his wife and their 1 - year - old son @entity73			1
@entity20 says he and his wife had seen enough in the line of duty to know what they would want in this situation			0
and this is n’t it			0
' i do n't agree with this law ' : @entity20 says he ca n't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the @entity16 law , which applies to all pregnant women , even those with do not resuscitate orders ' we knew what her wishes were ' : both @entity20 and @entity10 were both paramedics			1
he found her collapsed on november 26 and initiated @entity80 , but it was no use			2
@entity20 says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they would n't want to be kept alive by machines unfortunately your browser does not support @entity169			0
‘ we knew what her wishes were , ’ @entity20 , who found his wife unconscious on their kitchen floor and fought in vain to resuscitate her , told @entity173			1
per @entity16 state law : ‘ a person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient			2
’ the couple had merely discussed their mutual desire to never be kept alive by a machine and had n’t actually signed a do not resuscitate order			0
but that would n’t have made a difference			0
@entity16 gives rights to the unborn fetus over the mother ’s wishes even when a @entity193 has been signed , where the state ’s form reads , ‘ i understand under @entity16 law this directive has no effect if i have been diagnosed as pregnant			1
’ for now , doctors say the baby has a normal heartbeat , though it remains unknown how it was affected when @entity10 ’s brain was deprived of oxygen			1
‘ they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ’ @entity20 told @entity136			0
‘ but i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead			0
’ ' they do n't know how long the baby was without nutrients and oxygen , ' @entity20 said ' i 'm aware what challenges i might face ahead ' : though he does n't agree with the laws , @entity20 says he 's not interested in engaging in a long pro-life vs. pro-choice battle			2

@entity53 of @entity215 , @entity16 found his wife @entity10 unconscious on the kitchen floor on november 26
he and his mother - in - law @entity7 have now *spoken* out against a @entity16 law that puts a fetus 's rights ahead of a woman 's wishes
@entity10 is now 18 weeks pregnant , too early in the pregnancy for the baby to survive outside the mother
it is unknown how the fetus was affected after @entity10 was deprived of oxygen for an hour
