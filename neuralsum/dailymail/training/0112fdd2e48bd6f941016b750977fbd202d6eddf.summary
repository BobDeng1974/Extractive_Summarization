for more than 32,000 years , dogs have been our faithful companions , living , eating and breathing with us as we moved from cave - dwellers to city - builders			1
around this time , the planet lost our closest cousins - and , many argue , our competitors : neanderthal man , who had previously occupied present - day @entity10 for a staggering 250,000 years			1
now , an anthropologist is suggesting these two facts may be related - and it was our close friendship with our canine associates that tipped the balance in favour of modern man			0
@entity18 said that the advantages that domesticating a dog brought for us were so fundamental to our own evolution , that it made us ' top dog ' out of the competing primate species			0
all gone to dust : a lifelike museum figure of a neanderthal man is one of the few reminders of the past @entity18 analysed the results of excavations of fossilised canid bones from @entity10 , during the time when humans and @entity34 overlapped			1
the research first of all established a framework to our early ' best friend ' relationships , with early humans adding dog teeth to jewellery , showing how they were worshipped , and rarely adorning cave art with images of dogs - implying dogs were treated with a reverence not shown to the animals they hunted			1
the advantages dogs gave early man were huge - the animals themselves were likely to be larger than our modern day pooches , at least the size of @entity56 shepherds			1
because of this , they could be used as ' beasts of burden ' , carrying animal carcasses and supplies from place to place , leaving humans to reserve their energies for the hunt			2
an artist 's impression of a @entity34 site in @entity71 , in the days before @entity72 arrived on the scene lost in time : @entity34 now only lives on in our fiction , dramas , and occasional excavations in return , the animals gained warmth , food and companionship , or , as @entity18 puts it , ' a virtuous circle of cooperation '			1
they may also have influenced how we communicate			0
humans and dogs are the only animals which have large ' whites of the eyes ' , and will follow the gaze of another person			0
this has not been found in other species , and it is argued that , as our man - dog relationship evolved , we learned to use these non-verbal cues more often			2
as such , dogs became one of the first tools , or technologies , that humanity began to use , and as the relationship developed both ways , it became a lot deeper ingrained into our psyche			0
and , in those early days where every advantage was needed to survive , neanderthal man might simply have been unable to cope with the new species which rapidly moved across @entity10			2
in short , @entity18 said : ' animals were not incidental to our evolution into @entity114 - they were essential to it			0
they are what made us human			0

dogs were our first ' tools ' , helping us reserve our energies for the hunt
man found his best friend *30,000* years *ago* **...**
**...** just around the time @entity34 lost their 250,000 - year *dominance* over @entity10
