the @entity8 teenagers who descended on a man ‘ like a pack of wolves ’ were instead given fixed penalties and released			1
by contrast , a local man who was less heavily involved in the altercation was hauled to court and jailed			0
jailed : @entity17 has been sentenced to a sixteen week prison term while @entity8 were given on the spot fines the decision was criticised by the judge who accused the police of ‘ clearing their books with the minimum of effort ’			1
district judge @entity27 said : ‘ it is extraordinary that the police decided to deal with the others whose behaviour was more serious by issuing fixed penalty tickets because , apparently , four of them did not speak @entity6			1
‘ i can not begin to understand how the police reached their conclusion			2
’ the allegation – denied by police – was made as @entity17 , 22 , appeared in court over the incident in @entity40 , @entity41			2
his solicitor told the hearing he was ‘ concerned as a council taxpayer ’ over the disparity in how those involved had been treated			0
district judge @entity27 who has slammed police for not prosecuting four @entity8 youths district judge @entity27 spoke out yesterday after being shown cctv of the incident showing the @entity8 he described as ‘ vicious cowards ’ joining in the attack			1
however , while @entity17 was charged , the @entity8 were given £ 80 fixed penalty notices , along with a local woman			1
@entity56 , representing @entity17 , said his client had retaliated after the unnamed victim hit him			0
‘ at no time did mr @entity17 expect the incident to develop in the way that it did , ’ mr @entity56 told @entity40 magistrates			0
‘ the others acted more seriously than mr @entity17			0
’ @entity65 , prosecuting , had described how @entity17 , of @entity40 , had punched the victim on the head and spun him on to the floor during the incident in may			0

does the crime fit the punishment ? ’ his girlfriend @entity83 , 23 , claimed they had been leaving a nightclub together when someone punched him for no reason			0
she said : ‘ he knocked him down and these @entity8 lads , who we did n’t know , came up			1
’ she claims that the @entity8 said in broken @entity6 , ‘ we saw what happened before ’ , then waded in			1

’ a spokesman for @entity98 denied language had been a factor in the decision and said @entity103 guidelines had been followed			2
the @entity8 , two aged 18 , one 17 and one 16 , had no previous convictions and were therefore fined , he insisted			2
the same applied to a 23 - year - old woman arrested over the attack , whereas @entity17 had ‘ extensive ’ previous offences and was ‘ heavily involved ’			0
the spokesman added : ‘ fixed penalty notices were not issued because of nationality or their ability to speak @entity6			1

' vicious ' @entity8 men walk away with on - the - spot fines while @entity6 is sent to prison
police deny nationality or ability to speak @entity6 was behind their decision
