a prankster was branded a ' reptile ' today after he admitted recording himself doing a vile @entity3 stunt by swallowing - a live frog and lizard			1
@entity6 , 23 , stripped to the waist and dressed in a ' @entity9 ' black curly wig and moustache before introducing the stunt to the camera			1
during the 90 - second - long clip , jeans downed a glass of water filled with crickets , before putting a frog in the same vessel and knocking it back whole			1
despite claiming he regurgitated the animals afterwards , @entity6 became the first person to be successfully prosecuted for causing cruelty to any creature other than a fish , while taking part in the web craze			1
he was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the animals , under the @entity50			1
@entity52 @entity51 also ordered him to pay £ 1,200 in costs after changing his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial			1
@entity57 inspector @entity56 said : ' unfortunately this is n't the first case we 've had involving @entity3 , but it is the first to come to court that involved animals other than fish			2
' the two small animals would have suffered considerably during this incident , going through the distress of being swallowed and coming into contact with stomach acids			2
' we hope this sick game is now on the decline as it is just not acceptable to subject animals to this sort of ordeal			2
' in the video , he said : ' hello this is @entity6 with a @entity3			1
' as you can see on the table in front of me , i 've got a glass full of crickets			1
i had to get little ones because the geezer thought i was buying these for myself			0
' i 've got myself a lizard and i 've got myself a frog			1
i 'm going to call this the " @entity90			0
" first up , for the crickets			2
' jeans zoomed the video camera onto to the frog so viewers could see that the amphibian was real he also showed viewers that he had put the lizard , pictured , into the bottom of his glass before drinking he also drank a glass full of crickets although these were not covered by animal protection legislation he then called the frog a ' little fellow ' , before swallowing it whole and declaring it ' f * * * ing lovely			1
' he said to the lizard : ' sorry mate , but you are next			2
in with the lizard , we 'll have some of that			2
add a little bit of water			2
do n't worry son , it 's your turn			0
' jeans then posted the footage on @entity24 , which led to people complaining to the @entity57			1
the only reason he was not prosecuted for killing the crickets during the 3 february stunt was because they are not covered under the @entity28			0
jeans was fined £ 1,200 and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid community service following his stunt last month , @entity129 , of @entity130 , north @entity131 , was criticised after drinking 70cl of the 40 per cent whiskey ahead of what he called a ' weekend on the beer '			1
health experts say the reckless stunt - in which mr @entity129 consumed at least 28 units of alcohol - could easily have killed him			0
the video , which has gained nearly 400,000 views on @entity142 , shows mr @entity129 biting the seal from the bottle of liquor while his friends laugh in the background			0
he then inserts a straw into the bottle to help the spirits go down quickly and knocks it back in less than 10 seconds			0
after spitting on the floor , he then tells his friends ' @entity153 that ' , a reference to the recent internet craze that saw some killed after drinking large amounts of alcohol			0
many of the video 's viewers went online to criticise mr @entity129 for completing the stunt , which they pointed out could easily have been fatal			0
in an earlier court case , bin man @entity164 of @entity165 , @entity163 was handed an 18 - month conditional discharge after he swallowed live fish during a @entity3 stunt from february			0
still from a video of @entity164 preparing and drinking a cocktail containing alcohol and four live minnows			0
( @entity57 ) in the video , @entity164 announces ' this is my @entity153 ' before downing a pint glass of wine , gin , vodka , rum and lemonade - together with the fish			1
the footage came to the @entity57 's attention after it was seen on @entity164 's facebook page			0
in it , after downing the cocktail , he nominates four other people to join the drinking game			0
the @entity153 phenomenon is understood to have emerged in @entity192 , with @entity164 's believed to be the fifth such case to come to court in connection with the craze			0
after being interviewed about the video , @entity164 later posted on @entity24 : ' some people 's lives must be that sad and boring , to get any excitement they have to report me to the @entity57 for my @entity153 , ' @entity164 was also ordered to pay £ 500 costs and a £ 15 victim surcharge .			1
