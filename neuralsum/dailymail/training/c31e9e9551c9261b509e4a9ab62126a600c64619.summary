the teenager ran away from home in the months leading up to her death and wrote suicidal thoughts in her diary			1
mrs @entity2 told the hearing : ‘ she was resentful and angry towards me			1
it began to build up			0
i suppose she hated me			0
‘ we all tried to talk to her about it but towards the end it was like talking to a stone wall			0
i would be the one who was saying “ you ’re not going down the road , you ’re not mixing with those teenagers ”			0
‘ she really began to hate me because i was the one who had to make the stands with everything			0
’ struggles : @entity22 , pictured with a former teacher , had made a number of suicide attempts before her death pupil : the 13 - year - old was studying at @entity123 at the time of her death the inquest heard @entity22 was found hanged after her mother had been out for a walk			1
