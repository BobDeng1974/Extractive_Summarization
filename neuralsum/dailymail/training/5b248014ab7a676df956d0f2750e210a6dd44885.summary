' @entity11 sufferer @entity9 was told that she and husband @entity12 would not be able to conceive because they were both beset with a range of fertility problems			1
but after years of trying , one round of unsuccessful @entity19 , and what they thought would be endless heartache , the couple from @entity17 , have welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby @entity23 into their world after a surprise pregnancy			1
@entity11 sufferer @entity9 was told that she and husband @entity12 would not be able to conceive because they both had fertility problems , but now they have welcomed little baby @entity23 after seven years of trying , one round of unsuccessful @entity19 , and years of heartbreak , the couple are delighted to have conceived naturally about a year after they started trying for a child , mrs @entity9 , 32 , developed pains in her stomach and a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis			1
endometriosis means that cells which normally line the womb are found elsewhere in the body , such as the outside of the fallopian tubes , the ovaries and the bladder , and it can cause infertility			2
she also suffers with @entity11 , or chronic fatigue syndrome , leaving her too tired to complete even simple tasks			2
after this news , the couple were sent for fertility checks and devastatingly found out that as well as @entity9 ’s conditions of endometriosis and me , @entity12 also had low sperm count with a low motility , or quality			1
mrs @entity9 , 32 , said doctors had broken the devastating news to her and her husband 37 , that they were infertile on @entity62 2008			1
she said : ' it was an ironic day to find that out , ' admitted @entity9 , ' and it felt like the worst day in the world			1
' after one unsuccessful cycle of @entity19 , paid for by the @entity68 in 2011 , the couple said they finally accepted defeat , after being left with only the costly option of private treatment , which at around £ 4,500 they simply could not afford			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' @entity12 decided to concentrate on work so we could try and save for ivf and i bought a car i had always wanted - a @entity78			2
' but then i started getting symptoms			2
we ’d had a lot of false alarms taking pregnancy tests so when we ’d been out to buy the pregnancy test i think @entity12 was bracing himself for more disappointment			0
' when i took the test , i just could n’t believe it			0
' with @entity9 's conditions of endometriosis and me , or chronic fatigue syndrome , and @entity12 's low sperm count the couple were told their only option was @entity19 the couple had given up hope of having a child after seven years of trying , when mrs @entity9 discovered she was pregnant with @entity23 , now just three weeks old mr @entity94 added : ' i was downstairs , ready with a box of tissues for tears			1
when she told me the result was positive , i have never run up the stairs so fast			2
' the proud parents have now welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby @entity23 into their world mum @entity9 described how she realised how her dreams had come true when she arrived home with the new baby after a difficult 36 hour labour			1
she said : ' it hit me after we got home and he was asleep			0
' i sat down on the edge of the bed and started crying , and said : ‘ you ’re so cute ! ’ ' i was crying but it was happy tears			0
i could n’t believe that my body , which would n’t work for me , had created something so perfect			0
' @entity12 described how he too had had tears streaming down his face			0
' i was chuffed to bits			0
we are still on cloud nine			0
' @entity9 , who was diagnosed with me in 2007 but had suffered with the symptoms since she was a child , explained that her condition leaves her very tired and run down - which made it harder for her to conceive			1
' i get very tired and ill often , so the symptoms put strain on your body so it wo n’t conceive			0
' in a strange turn of events , @entity9 added that when the doctor arrived to assist in the final stages of the delivery at @entity136 , she was staggered to recognise him from her time undergoing @entity19 treatment at @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141			2
she revealed he was the medic who had been involved in harvesting her eggs , who it turned out had subsequently moved to @entity136			0
' he was quite taken aback , ' she said			0
' he had been there at the start of it all and he was there at the end			0

despite being told in 2008 they would never have a child naturally , @entity9 and @entity94 have had a *healthy* baby boy
the couple , who have a host of fertility problems , were *shocked* to discover they were finally expecting *earlier* this year after they had given up hope
6lbs 15oz baby @entity23 was born on november 1
