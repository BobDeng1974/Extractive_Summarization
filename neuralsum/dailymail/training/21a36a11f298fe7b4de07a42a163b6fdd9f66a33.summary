a powerful explosion on the peak of the 3,000m - high @entity9 mountain rocked the region at around 2pm local time ( 7pm bst )			1
engineers were blasting away a million tonnes of rock to make way for the most powerful telescope ever to be built			2
named the @entity17 , or @entity17 , the observatory could aid the search for alien life and unravel the long - held mysteries of the universe			1
it is due to be completed in 2022 when scientists claim it will be able to take direct images of planets orbiting distant stars			2
as the name implies , the telescope will be immense			2
around 2,500 tonnes of steel rigging is already heading to @entity2 to hold a mirror nearly 130ft ( 40m ) wide			2
dubbed the ‘ world ’s biggest eye on the sky ’ , it will capture 15 times more light than any other telescope in existence with images 16 times sharper than those produced by @entity40			1

once the rugged mountain top has been tamed , the £ 879m ( $ 1.1bn ) e-elt will have ideal conditions for observing deep space a £ 1 billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) ' time machine ' , which could reveal mysteries of the universe , is finally complete			1
the last giant antenna for @entity73 , the world ’s largest land - based observatory , recently arrived in @entity2 allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before			0
it is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed			0
the @entity73 array is situated high on the @entity85 , a remote area of the @entity1 in northern @entity2 at 16,400 feet ( 5,000 metres ) above sea level			0
there , the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky			0
with the latest arrival , the observatory combines the forces of 66 radio antennae , most almost 40 feet ( 12 metres ) in diameter			0
combined , they make the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles ( 15 km ) away			0
astronomers claim @entity17 could provide a key insight into the first galaxies to form after the @entity102 14 billion years ago			1
they also hope it will shed light on one of the biggest mysteries of our universe - the formation of ' dark matter ' , which ca n’t be seen but is believed to make up most of the mass of the cosmos			2
‘ the e-elt will allow astronomers to reach deeper into space , further back in time and more intimately into the workings of the universe than any other visible to infrared telescope ever built ’ , said dr @entity114 , deputy project scientist for the @entity116 e-elt project at @entity117			1
‘ from probing the first galaxies that formed in the universe , to studying extra-solar planets and looking for signs of life , we can expect break through advances and new discoveries with the @entity17			1
’ once the rugged mountain top has been tamed , the £ 879m ( $ 1.1bn ) e-elt will have ideal conditions for observing deep space			1
its location means it is far above most of @entity137 's atmosphere and water vapour , which would otherwise obscure observations			0
the telescope is the latest project for the @entity142 ( @entity142 )			0
@entity116 is one of 15 countries involved in the e-elt and has invested £ 88 million ( $ 149 million ) towards the project			1
the design for @entity17 followed plans for something known as the @entity149 ( @entity149 ) which was hoped to have an aperture of 100 metres - the same distance that @entity152 ran in 9.58 seconds			1

two other major project - the @entity163 and the @entity172 – are being built alongside @entity195 ’s efforts			0
the @entity163 ( gmt ) is currently under construction atop @entity197 in @entity2 at an altitude of 8,366 ft ( 2,550 metres ) above sea level			0
the @entity163 is a $ 700 million ( £ 420 million ) project being funded by the @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 and expected to be operation in around 10 years			2
meanwhile , the € 1bn ( £ 900m ) @entity172 had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year			2
it is being constructed on @entity175 's peak in @entity206 which already hosts about a dozen other telescopes			0

pictured is an artist 's impression of what it will look like the race will see sophisticated observatories built on top of mountains in @entity206 and @entity2 in an attempt to see the wonders hiding in the outer reaches of the cosmos			0

explosion rocked @entity226 at around 2pm local time ( 7pm bst )
130ft - wide @entity17 will sit on *flattened* area
it will capture 15 times more light than any other telescope in existence
e-elt could unravel long - held *secrets* about how first galaxies formed
the £ 879m ( $ 1.1bn ) telescope is expected to be operational by 2022
