by @entity0 and @entity1 in @entity2 and @entity3 and @entity4 police investigating the disappearance of @entity8 are carrying out dna tests on scraps of clothing they found in a hidden pit just feet from where she vanished , it has been claimed			1
forensic experts drafted in from the @entity16 are said to be carrying out analysis of the ' non-organic ' material , which was found near a hole in the ground on wasteland in @entity25 's @entity24 resort			1
the find comes as officers said they need they need at least another week to search the strip of wasteland , which is just 1,000 feet from the @entity30 complex from which @entity31 went missing on the evening of thursday may 3 , 2007			1
the items have now been sent for forensic analysis discovery : the hole has been been subject to intense police investigation since it was discovered on wednesday			1
it is believed to have been used by children playing in the area for years new phase : @entity16 police yesterday began inspecting sewers under wasteland minutes from where @entity31 was last seen as their @entity25 counterparts watch on manhole covers were lifted and cameras dropped down to survey the complex network of pipes the hidden pit is on the southern tip of the area @entity16 police have been given permission to search , according to the @entity62			1
it is said to have previously been used by local children as a play area			0
referring to the discovering of scraps of clothing , the newspaper quoted a source as saying : ' it could be days before the significance of the items is known ... several [ items ] are being analysed by the @entity16 team			1
' @entity75 has refused to provide ‘ a running commentary ’ on whether any leads have so far been found			1
yesterday @entity16 detectives working in the @entity80 resort pulled up manhole covers and began analysing the network of sewer pipes using micro cameras and fibre - optic cables			1
they have yet to say whether they have found anything significant , but @entity31 's parents - @entity89 and @entity90 - said they were ' encouraged by the progress ' of the search			2
the area @entity16 police have been given permission to search is not far from the apartment where the @entity97 were staying			1
it is understood to have previously been used by local children as a play area experienced : seven - year - old @entity102 springer spaniels ' @entity100 and @entity103 ' from @entity104 , who helped hunt for @entity106 , were back on the land for a fourth day hot work : the dogs were covered in water and a wet blanket as their handlers ensure they did not overheat in the @entity80 sun the sewer system being searched was installed as part of failed plans to build a hotel on the site before @entity31 disappeared in 2007 , but after a planning battle it remained wasteland			1
the search of the area for clues to what happened to the three - year - old from @entity126 is expected to go into a second week after @entity16 police were granted an extra seven days by the @entity25 authorities to keep searching			1
sources said detectives had not realised just how hard and dry the land would be where they have been digging for clues			2
the extension may also have been granted after surprise finds at the first site , where a large concealed shaft was discovered by sniffer dogs			0
officers also believed they had come across a burial site late on wednesday but this has since reportedly been ruled out as an area of interest			2
bones were discovered on the site but tests showed they were from cows and pigs			0
forensic approach : police have split the wasteland into at least 12 areas of interest , using dogs , scanning equipment and fingertip searches vantage point : at the centre of the search site is a hill , where officers on horses and also with telescopes are taking advantage of the height to look for evidence however , @entity165 and mrs @entity166 yesterday wrote online to well - wishers saying they are ' encouraged by the progress ' ‎ of searches for their missing daughter			1
@entity175 on the couple 's official find @entity172 , @entity89 and @entity90 said : ' we are kept updated on the on - going work in @entity25 and are encouraged by the progress			0
' thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get @entity31 home			0
' ‎ mr and mrs @entity166 , who have not travelled to @entity2 , were previously said to have been bracing themselves for ' significant news '			0
meanwhile sniffer dogs used to hunt for murdered schoolgirl april @entity187 were again on the site hunting for evidence			0
the seven - year - old @entity102 springer spaniels – @entity100 and @entity103 – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time			2
on wednesday they uncovered concealed shaft covered with corrugated iron , yards from the spot where @entity8 vanished			0
@entity75 moved in to seal off the area with large white tents			2
this shaft is understood to be the area where the ' non organic ' material was discovered			2
investigation : @entity31 ’s parents @entity89 , 46 , and 45 - year - old @entity90 have not travelled to @entity25 but are being kept closely informed and are said to expect ' significant news ' on their daughter five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence			2
the shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was covered with wooden planks , a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of earth			0
a local source said : ‘ the discovery of the hole came as a surprise			0
police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay things			0
’ the area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine			0
it was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen walking in the direction of the site on the night that @entity31 was last seen alive .			0

' non-organic ' material , believed to be clothing , was found in a hidden pit
@entity16 forensic experts are now carrying out analysis of the items
