by @entity0 published : 03:39 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 08:45 est , 26 august 2013 a photographer has captured candid and incredibly moving photographs of teenage triplets , all of whom suffer from autism			0
over the course of two years , @entity7 , 50 , from @entity8 , has followed three 18 - year - old brothers who were all born with the same complex neurological disorder			1
mr @entity7 wanted to follow @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 because he was fascinated and touched by their interaction			1
mr @entity7 also has personal experience of the condition as his nephew is autistic			2
here @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity13 ( left to right ) are on their way to school in their parent 's car			1
it took three years for them to be diagnosed with the complex neurological disorder the condition is characterised by a difficulty to communicate and socialise yet the three men have a visibly strong brotherly bond			0
the men 's parents , @entity34 and @entity14 , said that it was shortly after their sons turned one that they started to notice differences between them and children of the same age			1
they said that the boys did not respond to their calls and seemed disinterested by things that should have fascinated the them - planes in the sky , barking dogs and offerings of sweets all went unnoticed			0
here the triplets ' clothing is laid on the bed they sleep in during summer			0
they like to wear the same clothes as each other isolated : @entity12 is pictured in the school playground			2
the image captures how difficult it can be for autistic people to interact with their peers and the wider world every day , @entity14 and @entity12 write their diary , documenting exactly what they have done , including minute details such as playing on their @entity65 console			1
those with autism tend to be obsessive about their routine this photograph captures the touching moment that father @entity14 washes and shaves his son , @entity12			1
despite their age , the triplets will remain childlike and vulnerable for the rest of their life it took three years and a raft of tests for them to be diagnosed			0
they were not deaf , there were not obvious genetic ot neurological problems			0
' when you do not have any of these symptoms , you have autism , ' @entity34 said			2
@entity13 suffers with the most severe learning difficulties out of the three because he suffered a brain injury in childhood			1
as a result he attends a specialised autism centre			0
@entity12 and @entity13 may be 18 - years - old but their condition makes them remarkably childlike			1
here they are photographed playing cowboys at home @entity12 is fixated by an image of himself in a mirror of a supermarket			2
autism removes a person 's understanding of what is acceptable in social situations his brothers @entity12 and @entity14 however attend the local high school that offers special classes to help them integrate with those unaffected by the condition			1
as with many people suffering autism , the men are very keen to stick to a routine			2
they tirelessly document their days - even recording the minutiae of atching tv , washing the dishes and , as one diary entry says , ' eating a coconut yoghurt and playing @entity65 '			2
every friday the men go to the town library to rent out movies			0
they also visit their local leisure centre to socialise with other children who have autism			0
here @entity14 enjoys being pampered by his mother and aunt in preparation for a costume party			1
the photographer 's images give a rare insight into the complex world of men living with a condition that remains relatively misunderstood @entity13 always carries small objects in his hands - everyday items that he calls ' inventions '			1
autism is often characterised by obsessive tendencies , such as becoming fixated by seemingly unimportant objects here the brothers play , supervised by a social worker , while they wait to be picked up by their parents from their weekly club			0
every friday they play games and meet other people with autism at a local recreation centre @entity12 is an accomplished artist and enjoys playing puzzles			1
since the age of six he has been able to complete 1000 - piece jigsaws in a matter of hours			0
@entity13 , always carries what he refers to as ' inventions '			2
objects include clay figures and everyday household objects such as combs , pegs , scissors and pencils			0
@entity14 has a incredible memory - for example , if he is given a date he is able to tell you what day of the week it was , even if it was many years ago			1
@entity13 does not like noise and here he covers his ears in the recreation centre he attends each friday			2
there he interacts - by bowling , for example - with other autistic people @entity12 is pictured completing a puzzle			1
since the age of six he has been able to complete 1000 - piece jigsaws within a matter of hours @entity14 is the most competent at interacting and speaking with other people and is the natural spokesperson of the three			1
despite their age , the men will always be childlike - both in terms of their interests and their understanding of the world around them			0
mother @entity34 said : ' i look forward to the age that they can realise their dreams			1
maybe they can go to the @entity197 , or work in a factory in their @entity199 with their cousin , @entity201			0
' ' many autistic people have communication and language problems and they do not understand lies , sarcasm			0
' we are not only a form family			1
' this photo shows a moment of intimacy between a mother and son			0
@entity34 hugs @entity215 after he returns from his friday night out at the recreation centre where he meets other people with autism everyday life : here @entity13 , the most severely autistic of the three brothers , hides his face while @entity14 and @entity12 hang up the washing loving family : @entity34 and @entity14 look at an x-ray of the mouth of @entity215 on the bus home from the hospital			1
because of their condition , the triplets rely entirely on their mother and father for their wellbeing @entity7 hopes his photographs will encourage greater support from the @entity238 government and autism organisations for families like the @entity241			2
he said : ' despite the condition , this family is very happy			0
every day is quite hard for them , but they go to bed happy			0
' it makes you put your life into perspective			2
what i once thought were big worries are nothing when confronted with the task the @entity241 have on their hands			0

@entity7 followed brothers @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , from @entity8 , for a photography project
the images document daily life - from showering and getting dressed in the *morning* to socialising with people and interacting in public *spaces*
the men live a happy existence despite their difficulties and their mother , @entity34 , said : ' we not only form a family . we are a team '
photographer that the the project helped him put his life into perspective
