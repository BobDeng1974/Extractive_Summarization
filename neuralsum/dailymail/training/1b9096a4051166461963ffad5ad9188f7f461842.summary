by @entity0 published : 09:43 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 6 march 2013 a council is tied into a contract where it will have to pay out an ' astonishing ' £ 2,000 every time a highways contractor plants a sapling on a roadside			1
taxpayers will foot the bill for the sky - high sum every time private company @entity11 digs a hole and plants the trees on pavements , verges or central reservations in @entity17			1
the extravagant cost to the public purse has been criticised for coming at a time when public services are being squeezed across the country with cuts being made to vital services			1
' astonishing ' cost ' : council highways contractor @entity11 is charging £ 2,000 for each sapling planted on roadsides in @entity17 contracted company : @entity11 has a £ 2.7billion contract to upgrade and maintain @entity17 's highway network until 2035 @entity31 , campaign manager , of the @entity32 said : ' this is an astonishing amount to pay just for planting roadside trees			1
' given the bill , residents could be forgiven for thinking their street should look like the @entity38 after contractors have visited their road			0
' contracting out services has to represent value for taxpayers ' money , so poorly negotiated contracts should be axed to ensure that taxpayers ' cash is being spent wisely			0
' the saplings can be bought direct for as little as £ 20 from garden centres - a hundredth of the cost being charged by highways contractor @entity11			1
costly : a planted sapling in @entity54 where the council is facing £ 100million of cuts the costly charge has been blasted as ' reprehensible ' by councillors at @entity59 , which is facing £ 100million of cuts			0
chairwoman of the council 's transport and sustainability committee @entity65 was stunned by the @entity11 tree fees			1
the @entity68 councillor said : ' i have to say i find this charge ridiculous			0
it is reprehensible that , in 2013 during a time of austerity , we are being asked to pay this much for a natural resource			0
' her colleague @entity75 added that a local tree planting scheme would blow an entire community budget - leaving no money for anything else			0
but @entity11 , which has the £ 2.7billion contract to upgrade and maintain @entity17 's highway network until 2035 , said that the cost was justified			1
contract manager @entity85 said : ' it can not be compared to placing a tree in a park			2
the highway is a hostile environment for a tree			2
' particular species need to be selected , then there are ground works and the impact on utilities to be considered			0
' the work is carried out on an active highway , then there are accidents and vandalism			0
' mr fellows added that the trees are maintained until 2035			2
the issue came up as councillors discussed the draft @entity108 , which promotes tree planting and looks to protect parks and open spaces , not only to reduce pollution and carbon emissions , but also to promote healthy lifestyles for citizens			0
the council has a total of more than 70,000 trees lining the roads and many hundreds of thousands in parks , open spaces and gardens - all of which make a contribution to the environment , the committee heard			0
criticism : the @entity32 criticised the charge by @entity11 - saying residents could be forgiven for thinking their street should look like the @entity38 by the time the company has finished feeling the crunch : @entity59 is currently facing £ 100million of cuts from its budget a @entity59 spokesman : ' to date , no additional trees have been planted and so @entity59 has not been charged for planting and upkeep of saplings			1
' @entity11 maintains and manages the city ’s highways trees as part of its 25 year - long contract with @entity59			1
' this includes looking after all 70,000 existing trees on the highways network			2
' occasionally , it may be necessary to remove a tree , which is then replaced under the terms of the 25 year - long contract at no additional cost			1
' if an additional tree was requested there would be an additional cost as this tree would not have fallen within the remit of the original contract			2
' however , to date no additional trees have been planted and so no additional costs have been incurred			0
