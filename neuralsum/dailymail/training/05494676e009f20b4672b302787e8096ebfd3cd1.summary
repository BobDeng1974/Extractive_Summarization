president @entity0 is putting a symbolic twist on a time - honored tradition , taking the oath of office for his second term with his hand placed not on a single @entity7 , but two - one owned by @entity8 and one by @entity9			1
the inclusion of @entity7 is particularly significant since the inauguration comes on jan. 21 , the federal holiday in honor of the civil rights leader , who delivered his ' @entity17 ' speech 50 years ago at the @entity18			2
@entity0 will be facing the memorial as he takes the oath			0
@entity21 , which his children say he used early in his career as a preacher , has never been part of a presidential inauguration before			0
swearing in : the first lady @entity28 holds the @entity29 as president @entity0 takes the oath of office in 2009 , this time he will use two bibles the inclusion of @entity8 's @entity7 in president @entity0 's inauguration is particularly significant as it is 50 years since the civil rights leader delivered his ' @entity17 ' speech at the @entity18 president @entity0 , top hand , is sworn in as wife @entity28 holds up the same bible used by former president @entity9 during @entity39 's inauguration ceremony in 2009 though there is no constitutional requirement for the use of a @entity7 while taking the oath , @entity40 began the tradition with a @entity7 hastily grabbed from @entity48 's @entity47 no. 1 for his swearing - in on april 30 , 1789 , in @entity50			1
since then , presidents have typically chosen bibles with historical or personal significance , many using family heirlooms			1
@entity0 is not the first president to select two @entity57 - @entity56 did so in 1949 , @entity58 in 1953 and @entity59 in 1969			1
the selection of the pair of @entity57 by @entity0 is richly symbolic of the struggle for equality in @entity64 , beginning with @entity9 's emancipation of the slaves through @entity8 's civil rights movement and ultimately to @entity0 becoming the nation 's first black president			1
inaugural planners say @entity0 plans to place his left hand on the stacked bibles held by first lady @entity28 as he raises his right hand to repeat the oath administered by @entity76 chief justice @entity75			0

@entity0 used the @entity29 while taking the oath four years ago - the first time it had been used since the 16th president 's inauguration in 1861			1
@entity0 's inaugural committee says that the president plans to use the first lady 's family 's @entity7 for a private swearing - in at the @entity95 on sunday , jan. 20			1
public presidential inaugurations traditionally are n't held on sundays , even though the @entity97 states that a president 's new term begins automatically at noon on the 20th			2
vice president @entity101 will use a @entity7 that has been in his family for 120 years and that he 's used every time he 's been sworn into federal office @entity8 's children describe their father 's @entity107 version as his ' traveling @entity7 ' that he took as part of a collection of books he carried with him while constantly on the road and used for inspiration and preparing sermons and speeches			1
his daughter @entity77 says her father marked the pages with several dates from may 1954 , the same month he delivered his first sermon			0
' we know our father would be deeply moved to see president @entity0 take the oath of office using his @entity7 , ' @entity8 's children said in a statement provided by the inaugural committee			1
' his traveling @entity7 inspired him as he fought for freedom , justice and equality , and we hope it can be a source of strength for the president as he begins his second term			2
' selling : a vendor hawks @entity0 merchandise in @entity135 , ahead of his inauguration later this month @entity0 also plans to honor @entity8 throughout his inaugural weekend , beginning by asking @entity64 to volunteer in their communities on saturday , jan. 19 , to honor the civil right leader 's legacy of service			2
the king family plans to participate			0
inaugural planners also say there will be a float honoring @entity8 in the parade to the @entity95 after the swearing - in ceremony			0
some presidents kiss the book after completing the oath			0
sometimes the @entity7 is open to meaningful passages , such as president @entity152 's choice of @entity153 - ' those who hope in the @entity154 will renew their strength			2
they will soar on wings like eagles ; they will run and not grow weary , they will walk and not be faint			0
' inaugural planners say vice president @entity101 will use a @entity7 with a @entity164 cross on the cover that has been in his family for 120 years			0
@entity101 has used the @entity7 every time he 's been sworn into federal office , back to his entry in the @entity170 40 years ago			0
turnout : the 2013 inauguration is n't expected to draw the same crowd that flocked to the event in 2009 , pictured crowds may have flocked to the @entity177 to see president @entity0 make history in 2009 , but the team behind the president 's 2013 inauguration bash later this month are bracing themselves for a ton of empty seats			1
the ceremony that @entity135 will stage in a few weeks wo n't be the historic affair it was in 2009 , when nearly two million people flocked to the @entity187 to watch @entity0 take the oath of office			0
this time , @entity135 officials expect between 600,000 and 800,000 people for @entity0 's public swearing - in on the steps of the @entity187 on monday , january 21 .			0

presidents select which @entity7 to use at their inauguration based on historical or personal significance
@entity0 is the fourth president to use two bibles , the first since @entity59 in 1969
this will be the first inauguration to use @entity8 's ' traveling @entity7 ' which he used when preaching
the president will once again use the @entity29 , first used at the 16th president 's inauguration in 1861
