it is a grim outlook for the fate of @entity3 ringleaders @entity4 and @entity5 as six people convicted of drug offences were executed by firing squad in @entity9 under its new hard - line president			1
president @entity11 ordered his first round of executions in the early hours of sunday , with four men and six women dying			2
one woman , @entity16 , was from @entity9 while the rest hailed from @entity18 , the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
the island is home to a high - security prison located off the south coast of the archipelago 's main island of @entity46			2
all of the executed were caught attempting to smuggle drugs , except for @entity49 who was found guilty of operating a huge ecstasy - producing factory			1
the executions of those who were handed their sentences between 2000 and 2001 were carried out just after midnight on sunday , the @entity52 reported @entity9 attorney - general 's office spokesman @entity56 as saying			1
@entity4 , 31 , and @entity5 , 33 , are expected to be executed this year , but the former is waiting to hear back from the court about whether or not he has been granted clemency			1
@entity18 national @entity62 ( right in 2004 in his holding cell ) along with @entity19 citizen @entity49 ( left in 2003 ) were both executed on sunday morning , just after midnight @entity3 ringleaders @entity4 ( right ) and @entity5 ( left ) are scheduled for execution in 2015 the latter had his appeal rejected last month , @entity65 reported			1
in a last - ditch effort to save his client from meeting the same fate as those executed on sunday , @entity5 's @entity9 lawyer @entity68 told @entity73 he would be submitting a request to @entity75 for a case review next week			1
this review , which is called a pk in the south - east @entity80 country , is usually granted when new evidence emerges			2
both @entity4 and @entity5 have had previous @entity82 rejected before			2
but it is not known if an appeal for a second review will even be allowed as there is no legislation surrounding the issue as of yet in @entity9			2
a convoy of ambulances carrying coffins make their way to @entity29 prison at @entity94 , @entity30 , @entity31 ambulance transports the body of executed @entity19 @entity37 from @entity29 prison police officers and security personnel stand guard as a ferry carrying ambulances sets off for @entity29 island where the executions of the five of six drug convicts were carried out an ambulance carrying the coffin containing the body of drug convict @entity21 national @entity25 leaves from @entity29 island mr @entity68 said the law had been applied wrongly to the last review , which was denied by the @entity111			1
the lawyer will argue @entity5 , who has served 10 years in prison , is now reformed and has helped fellow prisoners also rehabilitate by setting up in - house jail programs			2
' if the purpose of any sentence is rehabilitation ... those who have made a significant change in their life should be given relief			0
it does nâ€™t mean that he has to be freed because he has also admitted that he is guilty of a narcotic crime , mr @entity68 told @entity73 ' however , there are many forms of punishment			0
a life sentence or 20 years prison term or 25 years prison term			0
there are many forms of other punishment			0
i just want to ensure that the perspective of justice should be at the forefront			0
' the members of the @entity3 were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle 8.2kg heroin into @entity144 @entity145 in @entity146 is where @entity4 and @entity5 are being held in @entity9 if the pair - who were caught trying to smuggle in 8.2kg of heroin from @entity9 to @entity144 in 2005 - are to be executed , sunday would have given them a grim preview of what was to come for them			1
before the six convicted drug offenders faced the firing squad , made of 12 police officers , they were isolated in cells and were allowed last visits from family members and religious figures in the lead up to their deaths			1
they were lined up and donned aprons that had reflectors attached on them over their hearts			0
the six were shot dead all at the same time on sunday			0
their executions have attracted widespread criticism from world leaders , including from @entity173 , calling for mr @entity11 to scrap the death penalty			0
the organisation 's research director for south - east @entity80 and the @entity177 , @entity178 , called the executions ' a seriously regressive move '			0
@entity9 president @entity11 ( left ) has faced criticism over his first round of executions as leader a spokesman for @entity75 displays a clemency presidential decree for @entity5 ' the new administration has taken office on the back of promises to make human rights a priority , but the execution of six people flies in the face of these commitments , ' mr @entity178 said in a statement			1
' this is a country that just a few years ago had taken positive steps to move away from the death penalty , but the authorities are now steering the country in the opposite direction			0
' the government must immediately halt plans to put more people to death			0
' mr @entity178 urged @entity9 to ' impose a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to its eventual abolition '			0
while the @entity215 's foreign policy chief @entity214 called the plan ' deeply regrettable '			0
news of the looming executions has galvanised @entity144 seeking clemency for @entity4 and @entity5 , with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging @entity9 president @entity11 for mercy on their behalf .			1
