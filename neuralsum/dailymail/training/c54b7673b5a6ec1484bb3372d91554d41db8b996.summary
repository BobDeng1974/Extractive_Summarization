foreign jihadists from more than 80 countries have flocked to fight in @entity2 and @entity3 on an ' unprecedented scale ' , according to extracts of a @entity7 report			1
around 15,000 people have travelled to fight alongside @entity10 ( @entity11 ) and other hardcore militant groups from ' countries that have not previously faced challenges relating to @entity15 , ' it said			2
the study found a new breed of terrorist was being attracted by the extremist group 's ' cosmopolitan ' use of social media , pointing to examples when jihadists posted ' kitten photographs ' on @entity25			0
cute : a @entity7 report says ' unprecedented ' numbers of jihadists are flocking to join @entity11 in part thanks to the terror group 's love of posting kitten photos on @entity25 like this one on an account called @entity10 of cat big softy : this picture posted by the @entity37 shows a kitten next to two @entity40 machine guns the @entity7 study found a new breed of terrorist was being attracted by the extremist group 's ' cosmopolitan ' use of social media , pointing to examples when jihadists posted ' kitten photographs ' on @entity25 @entity11 leaders recognise ' the terror and recruitment value of multi-channel , multi-language social and other media messaging , ' it added			1
the number of foreign jihadists travelling to fight since 2010 exceeds the cumulative total of the 20 preceding years ' many times ' , the @entity57 study found			1
' there are instances of foreign terrorist fighters from @entity66 , the @entity67 and the @entity68 of @entity69 and @entity70 operating together , ' the report said , according to the @entity71			1
@entity69 's top police officer , @entity72 , estimated last week that five people a week were leaving the country to fight with @entity11			0
security officials estimate there are currently around 500 @entity68 nationals fighting in @entity3 and @entity2			1

@entity66 is also moving closer to adopting an ' anti-terrorism ' law which would slap a travel ban on anyone suspected of planning to wage jihad			0
the @entity7 warned that more nations than ever face the problem of dealing with fighters returning from the battle zone			2
the @entity100 @entity99 last month announced figures showing that there were around 20,000 to 31,500 @entity11 fighters active in @entity2 and @entity3 , much higher than previous estimates			1
around 15,000 people have travelled to fight alongside @entity10 ( @entity11 ) and other hardcore militant groups from ' countries that have not previously faced challenges relating to @entity15 , ' the report said the @entity7 found that foreign fighters preferred @entity11 's use of social media and were put off by the more dogmatic communication tactics of @entity15 a @entity100 security official estimated that there were close to 2,000 westerners among the 15,000 foreign fighters			1
previous figures showed there were 7,000 foreign jihadists fighting in march and 12,000 in july suggesting 1,000 a month were travelling to fight , despite the launch of @entity100 air strikes three months ago , although there is a lag of a few weeks in the figures			2
the report was produced by a committee that monitors @entity15 and concluded that the once mighty and feared group was now ' maneuvering for relevance ' following the rise of the even more militant @entity11 , which was booted out of @entity15 by leader @entity132			0
despite the split , the @entity7 concluded that the legal basis for @entity100 president @entity136 's fight against @entity11 was justified by its ideological congruence with @entity15 and considered the two groups as part of a broader movement			0
huge support : fighters from the @entity10 march through their stronghold of @entity144 in @entity3 ' @entity15 core and @entity11 ( @entity11 ) pursue similar strategic goals , albeit with tactical differences regarding sequencing and substantive differences about personal leadership , ' the @entity7 wrote			1
@entity136 has vowed he will not order a large force into combat in @entity2 or @entity3 , relying instead on air power and local forces			2
but his ' no boots on the ground ' pledge is coming under pressure amid growing calls for advisers and forward air controllers to deploy with @entity2 or @entity163 soldiers to help direct air raids and plan operations			0
the @entity167 's ' cosmopolitan ' use of social media , ' as when extremists post kitten photographs ' , was attracting a new breed of foreign fighters who are put off by the more dogmatic communication tactics of @entity15 , said the report			0
the @entity7 agreed with the @entity136 administration that ' core @entity15 remains weak ' , but argued that its demise had only paved the way for more bloody groups , for whom ' cross-border attacks - or attacks against international targets - remain a minority			0

15,000 fighters from 80 countries have flocked to fight in @entity2 and @entity3
numbers joining since 2010 exceed total from previous 20 years ' many times '
jihadists from @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 are operating together , says @entity7 study
