there is no doubting the significance of sunday ’s @entity2 now			0
debate has raged in @entity4 as to which their fans would rather see - a place in the @entity10 semi-final or a first win over @entity12 in six attempts			1
the majority sided with the former and a shot at a first domestic trophy since 1955			0
that dream , however , is dead			0
@entity18 and his players had talked of a ‘ massive ’ week in their season			2
well , it just got bigger			0
@entity22 consoles keeper @entity23 after a night to forget for @entity4 at @entity24 @entity4 's defence reels as @entity24 celebrate the final goal of their 4 - 0 defeat of the @entity28 on wednesday for @entity18 's side , sunday 's @entity2 takes on a new dimension now they 're out of the cup the manager had , in fairness , named just about the strongest xi available to him but it looked awfully weak against a @entity24 side who were superior in every department			1
the against - the - odds spirit that had inspired @entity4 ’s 2 - 0 victory at @entity42 in the last round was missing			1
it was , in the end , a rather timid surrender			0
apart from @entity47 , the @entity49 battering ram who tried his best to barge his team forward , the visitors offered little			0
@entity47 ’s compatriots @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 — a combined £ 20million worth of ‘ talent ’ — were passengers on a journey destined to end in defeat from the moment @entity23 spilled @entity61 ’s corner and @entity62 looped home the opening goal			0
a @entity4 fan , one of 4,200 supporters to travel down to @entity67 , gives his appraisal of the match these shirtless lads do their best to lift their team having made the journey for the @entity10 loss this has been a @entity4 team characterised by resistance and resilience , neither of which was in evidence			1
it was their second heavy loss in north @entity67 in five days and such drubbings will do little for the team ’s confidence come sunday			2
@entity18 is the only manager in @entity4 ’s history to lose three in a row against their @entity90 rivals and , with the mitigation of a cup run gone , he can ill afford another defeat this weekend			1
it was after @entity24 ’ fourth goal — @entity97 capitalising on another @entity99 spill — that @entity18 turned his attention to the derby			1
@entity12 boss @entity102 issues instructions to his players on their way to a 1 - 1 draw with @entity107 @entity108 ( left ) celebrates putting @entity12 1 - 0 up from the penalty spot at home against @entity107 the thought of going into that game without @entity47 is a frightening one and , when he took what proved to be an innocuous knock to the knee , @entity18 withdrew his star man almost immediately			1
his effort was recognised by the 4,200 travelling fans and they sang until the last kick of an otherwise torrid evening			0
@entity18 acknowledged their support but will be in doubt about how fast such goodwill would evaporate should they fail to show against @entity102 ’s side			2
the debate on radio phone - ins and in the local newspaper had been ‘ which of the two matches would you prefer to win ? ’ losing both was never an option			0
@entity18 , of course , has done tremendously well to transform his own and @entity4 ’s fortunes , but the mood can change quickly on @entity137			1
after this humiliation , @entity18 will be only too aware of sunday ’s significance .			2

@entity4 were *demolished* 4 - 0 by @entity24 on wednesday night
the loss came despite @entity18 placing high *priority* on @entity144
@entity18 's @entity28 host *fierce* rivals @entity12 on sunday
