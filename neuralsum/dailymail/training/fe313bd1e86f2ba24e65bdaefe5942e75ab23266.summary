a skiing holiday is not always about the slopes			1
at least , not for everyone - and not entirely for me			2
if that sounds enticing , then pretty @entity4 in the @entity5 is for you			1
it is dotted with wooden chalets and has its own @entity21 village scene going on : bars serving jazz with hot wine , interior design shops with rustic furniture and shaggy throws , a giant christmas tree in the main square which stays up all season , horse - and - carriage rides , @entity11 - starred restaurants , wonderfully cossetting hotels and aristocratic heritage			1
fabulously fashionable : @entity4 has been a magnet for chic skiers since the twenties how @entity4 looks now is partly down to @entity29 - or @entity28 , as she was known			1
in the @entity27 , the @entity28 - determined to create a glamorous resort which would rival @entity31 - alighted upon the @entity33 farming village beneath @entity34			1
she and a young architect , @entity35 , built the first ski chalet , @entity37 , now a hotel , then 200 further chalets			1
early ski - lifts , a golf course and airport followed			1
after @entity43 , so did the smart set , the author and artist @entity46 and @entity47 among them			1
so popular and prestigious was the resort , @entity46 referred to it as the ‘ 21st arrondissement of @entity52 ’			1
plenty of reasons to blow the budget : @entity4 's shops are just as alluring as its ski slopes @entity46 ’s favourite spot was the hotel @entity34 , now owned by hotel firm @entity60			1
here , in the art deco resturant with its @entity46 mural , you can slip into a more sultry era			2
@entity4 has plenty to recommend it			2
first , it ’s just over an hour ’s drive to @entity69 , so you can pop over for the weekend , as the fur - clad couples from @entity72 tell me they do all winter long			2
second , it is beautifully placed beneath @entity34 , and offers 201 miles of pistes , which are ideal for intermediate skiers such as me			2
the views are sensational , the runs are wide and there are plenty of my favourite types of slope - the wooded blues - and lots of lunch opportunities			0
hot and cold : @entity89 ( left ) offers welcome warmth after a long day on @entity4 's often gentle slopes at 1895 m , @entity92 is a lofty spot to warm up over a plate of macaroni cheese with truffles			1
there is a fromagerie and a dessert buffet			0
light lunching this is not			0
but that ‘ bon voyage ’ glass of @entity103 will fire you through an afternoon ’s skiing			0
i eat them - on pasta , pizza , in mashed potato , scrambled egg , on nuts - by the truck load			0
those @entity5 women who do n’t get fat must be skiing hard			1
@entity4 is known as the home of @entity5 skiing			1
there are n’t many @entity120 and it is very chic			2
@entity123 and @entity124 , in the village , offers designer labels such as @entity126 and @entity127			0
and fur is standard on and off the slopes			2
but you do not need extra layers in my hotel , @entity89 , where the very best spot is in the bar , by the fireside			0
swagged with tartan , checks and cowhide chairs , it is easy to settle down for cocktails served in twinkling copper cups			0
suitably stylish : the @entity143 is one of @entity4 's most elegant hideaways - and a great place to eat the hotel is one of five in @entity4 owned by the @entity149			0
it positively shouts kitsch @entity21 charm , but is comfortable and fun rather than cheesy			0
there is a spa offering treatments with @entity158 ’s own brand , @entity157			0
and if the glamorous owner , @entity158 is anything to go by , those creams must work			0
or maybe it is all those truffles and that very crisp mountain air			0
@entity165 ( 020 8939 0894 , www.flexiski.com ) offers three nights ’ b&b at the @entity168 , @entity4 , from £ 990 per person ( based on two people sharing ) including flights to @entity69 , all taxes and airport transfers .			0
