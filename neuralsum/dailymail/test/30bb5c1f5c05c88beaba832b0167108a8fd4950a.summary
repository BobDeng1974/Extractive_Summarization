there was a mild tremor felt in the room when @entity3 banged a fist on the table to reinforce his point after @entity7 had lost 1 - 0 at @entity8			1
the eruption follows next season			0
@entity11 revealed that he had 11 disappointed faces looking up at him in the dressing room , with the sunken eyes of @entity7 's players pleading with him to explain how they had come to be beaten			1
they dominated possession , completing nearly three times as many successful passes than the champions - elect and yet they were unzipped by a goal in the 38th minute from @entity23			1
despite @entity7 's defeat there were signs on saturday , what with the slick passing and their range of movement , that the battle lines have been drawn ahead of a proper title race next season			1
@entity11 's team are coming for @entity35 and this is what @entity37 football needs			1
@entity7 will be a serious challenger			2
@entity7 boss @entity3 was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1 - 0 by @entity35 @entity35 forward @entity23 ( left ) jostles for possession with @entity7 's @entity42 on saturday @entity7 midfielder @entity43 is sent hurtling to the ground following a challenge on saturday there is a growing sense , based on this performance , that @entity49 and @entity11 will be locked in full combat mode when the fixture list for the 2015 - 16 season is released in june			1
this is undoubtedly @entity35 's year , starting off with the @entity54 in february and moving on to become the effective team in the @entity56			1
they are ten points ahead of @entity59 with six to play			0
should @entity35 go on to win at the @entity60 next sunday and grab another three points at @entity62 the following wednesday they will be crowned deserved champions			2
this used to be @entity7 territory			2
in the summer they will spend more serious money again , fully intent on assembling a powerful squad to threaten @entity35 , a re-energised @entity70 and possibly even @entity59 over a 38 game season			1
there is work to be done , mainly through the middle , and @entity11 will prioritise central defenders ( @entity76 and / or @entity77 ) , an attacking midfielder ( @entity79 ) and another winger ( @entity80 ) in the summer			0
for now he can reflect on a promising performance , particularly with @entity82 dictating the tempo of the game so impressively in his posting just in front of the back four			2
he really looks a player			0
when @entity90 returns to @entity7 's team from injury , his partnership with @entity82 will continue to flourish in the centre of that midfield			1
@entity95 , who has missed @entity7 's previous four games in the @entity56 , returned at left - back because of an injury to @entity99			1
he looked solid , if short of fitness			0
@entity7 are considering an approach for @entity102 midfielder @entity79 ( centre ) in the next transfer window the @entity105 are also keeping tabs on @entity107 's highly - rated defender @entity76 ( right ) @entity7 still need to address a problem in attack , where @entity110 is patently short of confidence and lacking the sharpness that one elevated him into the elite category of strikers with @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			1
he will not be staying			0
@entity11 's methods and his regime , brutal as it is at times , is clearly having a positive effect on the majority of this squad			0
the captain @entity127 , playing in a deep - lying midfield position just in front of @entity82 because of the injuries to key players , spoke of ' dominating the football match '			0
@entity7 's on - loan striker @entity110 has struggled for form ever since joining the club last summer @entity7 captain @entity127 is deployed in an uncomfortable midfield role at @entity35 on saturday @entity95 ( right ) returns to the @entity7 first - team against @entity35 but looks to lack match fitness hazard shoots to score the opening goal against @entity7 at @entity8 on saturday the @entity141 forward slides on his knees in front of delighted @entity35 fans after giving his side the lead crucially @entity35 won it , but there was an obvious undertone to this fixture as @entity11 's team snapped at @entity152 in the centre of midfield and made life uncomfortable for the creator @entity156			1
' in terms of the way we moved the @entity35 players about , making them work , it was excellent , ' added @entity127			2
' over the last few months it has all started to click and the players understand what the manager wants			0
that 's showing in the performances			0
' i 've rarely seen a team come to @entity8 and dominate so much			2
all that was missing was the goal			0
' the target is topple @entity35 , to re-emerge as a genuince force in the @entity37 game after being left behind by @entity70 and @entity35 in the last two title races			1
it is true that @entity49 negated the threat of @entity178 , one of @entity7 ' s goalscorers at @entity180 during their convincing 4 - 2 victory over @entity70 the previous weekend			1
@entity35 's @entity182 puts in a solid performance in midfield to stifle the threat of @entity7 's @entity178 there was an element of doubt whether he would even be playing when his lookalike brother @entity189 arrived at @entity35 's team hotel on saturday morning to collect some match tickets from @entity23 , who is @entity178 's @entity192 team - mate			1
' i had to @entity194 him , ' explained @entity49 after a bum steer from the doorman			0
in any event , @entity35 's manager had a plan to keep the @entity7 midfielder quiet , and by and large it worked			1
' @entity182 played to stop @entity178 playing in the box , ' added @entity49			0
' he is doing amazing jobs for us			0
' mentally he is very strong			0
not just physically , but mentally			0
he has learned a lot from a tactical point of view			0
he is 20 years old , so we can imagine @entity35 will have him for 10 years			2
' this was an important victory for @entity35 , extending @entity49 's undefeated run to 11 games against teams in the top four since his return to @entity37 football			2
' louis is my friend , but we had them in our pockets , ' claimed @entity35 's manager			2
next season , though , promises to be very different			0
@entity35 manager @entity49 looks animated on the touchline during his side 's narrow win over @entity7			1

@entity35 edged @entity7 1 - 0 at @entity8 on saturday
@entity225 forward @entity23 scored the game 's only goal , but @entity7 dominated possession and completed many more successful passes
despite defeat , @entity7 's confident performance *suggests* that they will definitely be @entity56 title challengers again next season
@entity7 are preparing to spend *heavily* in the summer transfer window
