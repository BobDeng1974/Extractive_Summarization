by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale @entity2 manager @entity1 has joined the @entity4 team on the @entity6 casualty list by having his tournament accreditation taken away			1
@entity8 took action against @entity1 , who is working as a pundit for @entity12 channel @entity11 , after he allowed his accreditation to be used by someone else who wanted to watch @entity16 train			1
the @entity8 pass is strictly non-transferable with the terms and conditions that the @entity20 would have signed before receiving the accreditation informing him it could be withdrawn for regulation breaches			1
there would be extra sensitivity about the real @entity1 being at @entity35 training in any case with @entity16 manager @entity45 becoming a @entity47 rival next season as the new manager of @entity50			1
scouting : @entity1 got the chance to see the methods of future @entity50 boss @entity45 and it ’s understood @entity1 had received an invitation to visit the @entity35 camp from fellow @entity56 analyst @entity34 , who is about to join the @entity16 coaching team			1
neither @entity8 nor @entity11 made any comment about @entity1 , who can only be used as a studio analyst on their @entity61 set as he can not gain entry to stadiums or training grounds			1
mistaken identity : @entity1 allowed someone else to use his accreditation , resulting in its removal @entity4 and @entity2 will want central defender @entity71 to sort out his representation conflict as soon as possible with the youngster one of the few players to enhance his reputation this summer while training with the team in the @entity77 and @entity78 before coming home			1
the 20 - year - old ’s agent , @entity80 , daughter of former @entity82 midfielder @entity81 , has started legal proceedings against @entity85 for allegedly attempting to entice @entity86 away			2
the fall - out has seen @entity89 delay signing a new contract with @entity2 until october when his contract with @entity80 ’s @entity93 expires			2
resolved : @entity2 and @entity4 want promising defender @entity71 to sort out his representation @entity8 president @entity95 , who is rarely on camera during matches to avoid being booed by the crowd , is nevertheless confident enough about his besieged position to be seen having breakfast with his nephew @entity101 in @entity29 ’s @entity102			1
there have long been allegations of nepotism against @entity101 with his relative , the ceo of @entity107 , looking after @entity8 ’s media rights in @entity109 , including @entity110 and @entity111 , as well as the host broadcaster			2
date : @entity8 president @entity95 was had breakfast with his nephew @entity114 in the @entity102 a group of fans who appeared to jump out of wheelchairs while watching @entity118 in the opening game are being investigated by police for ticket fraud			2
it transpires a renowned @entity124 tour operator has been boasting about having tickets reserved for the disabled for at least one of the matches and also claims he did a runner from a @entity118 hospital to avoid paying the medical fees			0
not under suspicion , however , are @entity133 , who have achieved the notable double of looking after the @entity137 ’ travel in @entity118 as well as a lot of the @entity140 media who have been focusing their attention on @entity143			0
chauffeuring : @entity133 have been looking after the @entity137 ' travel around @entity118 noboby keen on @entity145 @entity145 , whose chief executive @entity146 paid his own way to @entity118 rather than freeload as an @entity150 board member , have found little interest in anyone wanting to buy the club at owner @entity155 ’s £ 200m asking price			0
the botched bid to find a new @entity158 chief executive , which is more than six months behind schedule , is said to include offering the job to former @entity163 chief @entity162			0
it ’s understood the salary did n’t impress him after his old role paid £ 640,000 per year			0
botched : @entity158 failed to convince former @entity163 chief @entity162 to be their chief executive @entity4 's exit after two games has n’t stopped culture secretary @entity172 , who has shown little interest in sport since joining the @entity175 , travelling to @entity176 for tomorrow ’s meaningless match			0
a @entity179 spokesman said @entity172 was already committed to meetings			0
the dead rubber in @entity176 is bad news for @entity183 , a ball boy for @entity4 ’s 1950 @entity6 exit against the @entity12 , who is seemingly always available for interview .			0
