a social experiment that brought together an enthusiastic hunter and a passionate vegan ended with some highly emotional and uncomfortable moments and a mutual agreement to disagree			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 in @entity7 , is an enthusiastic gun collector – with over 300 in his collection - who performs contract shooting at farms where wild pigs have become pests			1
he 's also an avid hunter who spends a couple of days a month participating in the sport			1
mr @entity5 spent 10 days with animal liberationist @entity17 , who lives at @entity20 's headquarters in @entity21 , as part of @entity24 's @entity23			1
the duo spent five days together in each of their homes , participating in the others ' favourite activities and attempting to gain an insight into the other side of the hunting debate			2
despite standing onside with the animal activists , mr @entity5 was less concerned about the ducks , and more so about the hunters			2
' when i first went down there i went on a duck shooting protest with them and i was taken aback by how horrible they are to the hunters and how derogatory they are , the way they torment them , ' mr @entity5 told @entity55			1
' their approach appeared to me as quite vicious , the way they attack the hunters , and they act like their opinion is the gospel truth			0
' he suggested that the activists instigate violence among the shooters before pointing the finger back at them			0
ms @entity17 's account of the event was entirely different			1
the 41 - year - old said mr @entity5 was visibly uncomfortable while surrounded by the large group of activists who were ' emotionally charged ' ; particularly while attempting to revive one of the ducks that had been shot			2
the duo went on a duck shooting protest in @entity21 where mr @entity5 said he was shocked at the way the activists ' tormented ' the hunters ms @entity17 said that mr @entity5 , who works as a pest eradicator at farms across @entity7 where wild pigs are a concern , told her following the duck hunting protest : ' i 'd like to take up duck shooting ' ' everyone was quite sensitive and he was quite uncomfortable with that , ' she told @entity55			1
' he tried to make light of it by making a few jokes and when i asked him what he felt about the rescue he just said : " i 'd like to take up duck shooting "			2
' so he was quite callous , but i understand because even if he did have a tiny change of heart he would n't want to admit it			0
' in contrast , when spending time at mr @entity5 's property , the duo took part in @entity101 's first ever pig hunt			1
' i had every intention of sabotaging the hunt , but i failed , ' ms @entity17 said			1
when spending time at mr @entity5 's property , the duo took part in ms @entity17 's first ever pig hunt in which she said she tried but failed to sabotage the hunt inside mr @entity5 's trophy room : mr @entity5 said he believes ms @entity17 would have ' rather hung around with a goat than with me ' ' i was going to make sure i made lots of noise so that any wild creatures around knew we were there and if i 'd seen any animals i would have stood between them and @entity5 , but unfortunately two pigs lost their lives towards the end of the hunt			1
' for the rest of my days i will regret having let my guard down for those two moments			0
' @entity5 's reaction when the pigs were killed was gleeful			2
he was excited and it was horrifying to see people so happy about a death			0
' both @entity5 and @entity128 said that despite having different opinions on hunting , they managed to generally get along			2
however , mr @entity5 said he believed the hunting experience ' really hurt ' ms @entity17 , adding ' i felt a bit sorry for her			1
' while ms @entity17 also admitted that she got along with mr @entity5 , she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home , saying she believed it was ' disrespectful ' ' i do n't think she enjoyed who i was or my life , she 's so anti-hunting that she could n't get past it , ' he said			1
' i think she 'd rather hang around with a goat or something than with me , and i 'm not joking			0
' while ms @entity17 also admitted that she got along with mr @entity5 , she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home			1
' i did n't think i 'd need to spell that out to him and i found it quite disrespectful and wondered if it was intentional , ' she said			0
overall , mr @entity5 said he would do it all again but that his opinion of vegans had been greatly lowered after the experience			2
' i 'm more opposed to veganism than i ever have been now and i do n't like their approach or their view of the world			0
they wo n't wavier either side , there 's no compromise – it 's more like a religion than a belief , ' he said			0
' i 'm more opposed to veganism than i ever have been now and i do n't like their approach or their view of the world , ' mr @entity5 said after the whole experience he said that it was mr @entity167 's opposition to pest eradication – such as that of wild pigs or foxes – and her suggestion to sterilise them instead which ' made no sense '			1
' i have shot foxes many times for eradication purposes - they are very detrimental to @entity181 wildlife and native mammals and birds and in @entity21 the government has even put out a bounty on them , ' he said			0
' i talked to her about it but she just does n't want us killing foxes at all			0
i said to her that one fox kills hundreds of thousands of @entity181 animals in its lifetime so i 've done what you want me to do which is to save those animals , but no. there is no sense to her argument			0
' ' i told her that if you do n't eat cattle then cattle wo n't live at all , and she was fine with that			0
i have a real problem with that because hunters want to maintain a species of animal			0
ms @entity17 said that she does n't believe violent measures are ever acceptable in pest eradication , saying : ' just as we would n't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet ' ' hunters hunt for the sake of being able to come back and next year and hunt again - unless were trying to specifically eradicate a pest our idea is to harvest an animal for meat or occasionally for trophy heads - but there 's not a lot of that ' when she was asked by @entity55 on her view of pest eradication , ms @entity17 said that she does n't believe violent measures are ever acceptable			1
' just as we would n't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet , i give all other species the same right , ' she said			0
