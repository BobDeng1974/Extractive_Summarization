by @entity0 published : 04:23 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 16:39 est , 9 october 2012 a retired @entity2 officer died virtually penniless after his family was forced to sell his home to pay for his dementia care			1
wing commander @entity6 had served his country all his life			1
but when his health deteriorated , his bravery counted for nothing – because he owned his house			0
under rules which punish thousands of responsible pensioners every year , he was told the £ 160,000 property would have to be sold to pay for the care he needed			1
penniless : @entity6 in 1991 at his son 's wedding , left , and the war hero in the late 1970s in @entity21 when he was @entity22			1
he has died nearly penniless after spending six years paying for his dementia care over nearly six years , the widower 's carefully - accrued savings – money he would have hoped to pass to his three grandchildren – were almost completely used up			1
finally , last month , his family managed to persuade the authorities that he was so ill he was entitled to state help			2
by a terrible irony , mr @entity6 died a week later , at the age of 88 and with virtually all his money gone			1
yesterday his family backed calls for a reformed care system which does not penalise responsible pensioners who have saved for their retirement			2
' i ca n't believe how my dad was treated , ' his daughter @entity36 , 54 , said yesterday			1
' he lost his house and his savings to pay for his care and it 's not right			2
he 'd worked hard all his life for his savings and served his country , but the reality is there are a lot of people just like my dad who are having to sell off their homes to pay for care			1
' they said that he did n't qualify because he had his @entity2 pension , savings and a house that he sold to pay for his care			1
it 's the system that is at fault			0
' my dad served his country but his country failed to serve him			0
' dementia sufferer : the retired @entity2 wing commander in a wheelchair earlier this year at his daughter @entity60 's wedding with her husband @entity62 mr @entity6 and his wife on their honeymoon in 1947			1
he died 10 years to the day since his late wife @entity66 died the £ 160,000 five - bedroom house that the 88 - year - old had to sell to fund his care in a residential home ' failed by the system ' : the war hero in the 1950s in @entity74 , left , and when he was based in @entity21 , right mr @entity6 was a member of the @entity75 before he joined the @entity2			1
during a colourful career he served in @entity74 in the 1950s , was involved in rocket tests in @entity78 and interviewed @entity80 prisoners in @entity82 's @entity81			0
at one point , he was even wanted as a spy by the @entity85			0
he was an aircraft engineer in @entity21 in the 1970s before he retired to @entity86 with his wife , @entity66 , where he played golf and enjoyed building and fixing clocks			2
mrs @entity92 died aged 79 in 2002 , and four years later mr @entity6 started showing signs of dementia			1
his family were told he would have to move to a care home – but officials at the @entity98 said he did not qualify for state help			1
mr @entity6 in the army in the late 1940s with a monkey on his head			1
the government finally agreed to fund his long term care a week before he died daughter @entity36 has vowed to fight for justice so others do n't suffer the same fate as he had more than £ 23,000 in savings , no support was available until the money ran out			1
as a result , his family had to sell his five - bedroom house in @entity113 to pay fees of up to £ 2,800 a month			1
over the next six years , nearly all of his savings were swallowed up			2
the family repeatedly argued that his health needs meant the bills ought to be subsidised – and finally on september 3 the health board agreed to healthcare payments			2
he died just a week later			2
' he definitely warranted help from the government , ' said his daughter , a dental nurse			2
' he was such an amazing person and had such an incredible career			0
i 'm glad he was in a good home where he was treated with such respect , dignity and love			2
' it 's a shame that he did n't get the same treatment from the government			2
' last year economist @entity134 , who was hired by the @entity135 to draw up a new funding system , suggested the amount pensioners have to pay for their care should be capped at £ 35,000			2
however it later emerged any change in the law could see a cap placed at £ 100,000 rendering the plan ' meaningless ' , according to critics			0
mrs @entity36 added : ' my dad had an amazing life - he went rocket testing in @entity78 and during the cold war he was interviewing prisoners at @entity81 and worked with the @entity151 secret service			1
' he was a bit of a @entity153 - the @entity85 wanted him at one time and put out his picture to say that he was n’t allowed in their country			1
i ’m not sure how true that is but it ’s what my dad used to tell us			0
' ' @entity153 ' : he served with the @entity75 with his father during @entity164 before he was commissioned to the @entity2 where he rose to become a wing commander mr @entity6 was an aircraft engineer in @entity21 in the 1970s and 80 hero : he joined the army after leaving school in 1939 and had an amazing life ' in october 2006 mrs @entity36 said she got a phone call from a local @entity151 gas man			1
the water tank had flooded my dad ’s house so he ’d called them out			0
' however the gas man rang me because he was concerned that my dad had appeared confused			0
i was really worried so took him to the doctors who did tests on him and he was diagnosed with vascular dementia			0
' i used to see him on a regular basis but i must have missed little signs because i saw him so often so it was harder to notice things , plus he had hidden quite a lot from us for ages			0
i do wish i saw the signs earlier			0
' after his diagnosis , mrs @entity36 was told that her father would have to move to a care home for his own safety			1
happy couple : mr and mrs @entity92 on their wedding day in 1947 but officials at @entity98 said he did not qualify for health care payments as he had more than £ 23,000 of savings			2
she said : the government will not fund anyone with more than that and dad had a five bedroom house and an @entity2 pension			1
' altogether it was about £ 160,000 of his savings that he had to use - including selling his house - over six years			1
' he did n’t know what was really going on			0
i know that there was nothing that we could do about it because someone had to take care of him			0
' when he was assessed i was told that he had quite a few severe needs and qualified for help			0
but they then moved him to another home that they said met his needs better rather than funding him			0
they kept moving the goal posts			0
' he was in a wheelchair and he was double incontinent and had sepsis - how poorly do you need to be to get help ? ' the @entity98 finally agreed to pay for mr @entity6 ’s care from september 3 but he died just a week later on september 10			1
mr @entity6 , pictured in @entity21 , paid £ 2,000 a month in care fees for six years mr @entity6 , centre , enjoyed playing golf and building and fixing clocks in his retirement mr @entity6 ’s family are now battling to claim some of his money			1
his daughter added : ' 10 days before he died we finally got the confirmation that he would have his care paid for - but it was too late and he died on 10			1
' i was told to cancel his direct debit - but it was too little , too late			0
he definitely warranted help from the government			0
some people are left with nothing after they die because they have been made to spend all their life savings on their own care and it ’s not right			0
' ' he was such an amazing person and had such an incredible career in the @entity2			2
this is why i was so upset and angry at the way he was treated			0
' it ’s too late for my family but i hope this helps other families to safe guard their inheritance			0
‘ we all want to help out children and grandchildren and pass money down the line but there is little to show for what an amazing life my dad had			0
' of course i ’m glad he was in a good home where he was treated with such respect , dignity and love			0
it ’s a shame that he did n’t get the same treatment from the government			0
' a spokesman for the @entity287 board said : ' people are eligible for @entity290 healthcare funding if their main care requirements are to address health needs			0

' this framework considers the nature and intensity of a person ’s needs , how different needs interact with each other and whether the needs fluctuate over time			0
' earlier this year @entity318 pledged to end the heartache of tens of thousands of elderly people who are forced to sell their homes to fund long - term care			1
he said he wanted to implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals pay at £ 35,000 - with the taxpayer picking up any further bills .			2
