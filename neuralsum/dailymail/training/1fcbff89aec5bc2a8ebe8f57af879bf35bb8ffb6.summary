by @entity0 major security concerns have been raised after a @entity3 reporter boarded a @entity5 flight to @entity6 carrying five knives – bought in an air - side duty free shop – with blades longer than those used by the 9/11 hijackers			1
he walked unchecked on to the packed plane after buying the potentially lethal £ 20 @entity15 knives at @entity16 , @entity17			1
the knives are on open sale , despite similar ones being used in a plane hijack attempt only two years ago			1
the startling revelation poses a massive question mark over the disparity of security checks at airports			0
blade runner : @entity3 reporter @entity0 brandishes the lethal blades in the aeroplane toilet after smuggling them aboard the @entity5 flight from @entity16 , @entity17 , to @entity6 at @entity34 airports , passengers face lengthy queues at security checkpoints			1
they are made to discard sharp and bladed objects , even ordinary scissors , and liquids over 100ml , including suncream			0
officially , @entity42 regulations allow passengers to travel with bladed items no longer than 6cm – the @entity15 knife is the same length – but an aviation security expert said people would not be able to board flights in the @entity34 if carrying the knives			1
last night , @entity16 airport and @entity5 insisted they were operating within @entity42 regulations			1
but critics said rules that can prevent mothers carrying baby milk on board yet allow knives to be carried unchecked were putting passengers in danger			1
on @entity63 flights , all types of blades , including @entity15 knives , are banned			1
in june , the @entity63 transport safety authority scrapped a plan to allow some small pocket knives on flights after a public outcry			1
@entity70 mp @entity69 said : ‘ we need to change the rules			0
you ca n’t legislate for the state of mind of the individual carrying the knife so why put the temptation in front of someone ? a 6cm toughened blade , which you get in a @entity15 knife , could be lethal in the wrong hands			0
‘ people will find it utterly incomprehensible that you can buy knives before getting on planes			0
’ disparity : @entity42 regulations allow passengers to travel with bladed items no longer than 6cm ¿ the length of the @entity15 knives ¿ but a security expert said people would not be able to board @entity34 flights carrying the knives after going through security , our reporter made two trips to the @entity100 store , which opened in march , and purchased the knives			1
the shop , yards from a police room , offers an array of knives and even sells knife - sharpeners			2
without even being asked for a boarding pass or passport , our reporter bought three knives on the first visit and two more on the second			0
@entity113 between £ 20 and £ 27 , the knives did not come in protective packaging			0
afterwards , our reporter simply walked through to @entity115 , even passing under a sign at the departure gate which showed a @entity15 knife with a red cross over it			0
he then travelled on a packed @entity5 flight to @entity122 last wednesday – with more than 120 people on board including small children			1
during the flight , our reporter posed for pictures with the blade of one of the knives extended			2
danger : after going through security , our reporter made two trips to the @entity100 store , which opened in march , and purchased the knives			0
the shop offers an array of knives and even sells knife - sharpeners @entity140 , an aviation security expert , said : ‘ it seems ludicrous that @entity143 stopped a child from carrying a toy gun on a plane a few weeks ago because it looked threatening , when that child could have had several knives on their person for mummy and daddy to use aboard the plane			1
there is wide disparity with what goes on at airports			0
if someone turned up at @entity122 with these knives , there ’d be some pretty stiff questions and the likelihood is those items would either be confiscated or put into the hold			0
’ mr @entity140 said that since the 9/11 attacks , the door from the passenger cabin to the flight deck are locked but occasionally opened to provide refreshments to the crew			2
he explained : ‘ if you ’re sitting in the front , you can see when that door is open and it does n’t take an @entity172 to work out you can be through there in a few seconds with a knife out			2
’ in april 2011 , @entity176 diplomat @entity175 tried to hijack a flight from @entity178 to @entity179			2
the 131 passengers on the @entity182 flight looked on in terror as @entity175 held a @entity15 knife to the throat of a female air stewardess , demanding to divert to @entity187			2
disaster was averted only after flight attendants and passengers overpowered the hijacker			2
the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters which can have blades shorter than @entity15 knives			0
multi-purpose : @entity198 penknives are armed with an array of potentially lethal blades a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ security regulations are set by government bodies such as the @entity42			1
we abide by such regulations			0
’ a @entity206 spokesman said : ‘ we are assured by @entity17 authorities that all pocket knives sold at their airports comply with existing rules , which allow knives with short blades , of 6cm or less , to be carried in hand luggage			1
’ a @entity16 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity15 knives with a blade of 6cm or less are allowed			0
‘ it does n’t matter if you buy the knife or knives before or after the security checkpoint , neither does the quantity , as long as the blade is 6cm or less in length			0

penknives are on open sale in duty - free section at @entity17 airport
expert says he would not have been able to board @entity34 flight with the blades
on @entity63 flights all types of blades , even penknives , are banned
