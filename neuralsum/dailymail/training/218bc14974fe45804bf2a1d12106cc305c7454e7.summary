he sees you when you 're sleeping and knows when you 're awake			0
but @entity2 did n't spot the secret camera that was set up to film him as he delivered presents to one young @entity6 boy and his family			2
seven - year - old @entity8 readied the small device to capture what happened in his living room once everyone had gone to sleep on @entity13			1
@entity13 miracle : seven - year - old @entity8 , right , ca n't believe what the camera captured after he went to sleep the next morning , after presents were opened , he and his family gathered around the computer to see whether @entity2 had visited - with a second camera recording @entity8 's face as he watched			1
a clip of both videos - played alongside each other - was posted online by a member of @entity8 's family			2
the video starts with @entity8 's older brother setting up his @entity30 camera in the empty living room			2
the seven - year - old becomes increasingly doubtful when nothing appears as the camera speeds through hours of footage from the room			1
hidden camera : @entity8 's brother ( left ) sets up the device in the family living room on @entity13 jingle bells : the boy 's face lights up as he hears what sounds like hooves and footsteps on the roof magic : @entity8 's eys are fixed on the screen as a kitchen light switches on and a cloud of smoke appears one family member suggests that perhaps the camera did n't capture anything , while another says that @entity2 needs to be sure that everyone is asleep			1
but then @entity8 hears the distant jingle of bells and stomp of reindeer hooves			0
he looks around excitedly and claps his hands - in disbelief that @entity13 is so close			0
and just as his family start saying that maybe it was only sound that was captured , the man in the red suit appears in a burst of magical smoke			0
the man in the red suit : the seven - year - old squeals with delight as @entity2 steps into the living room snack time : he giggles with his family as they watch @entity13 munch on cookies left out for him wish list : with a click of his fingers , @entity2 makes the presents appear under the tree in a cloud of sparkle @entity8 squeals with delight as he watches @entity2 enjoying the milk and cookies left out for him			1
@entity2 then turns towards the christmas tree and snaps his fingers - making an impressive pile of perfectly - wrapped presents appear in a cloud of sparkle			0
just after @entity8 remarks that @entity2 has n't noticed the camera , the man turns to face the camera , snaps his fingers , and the screen goes dark			0
the seven - year - old can hardly contain his glee - high - fiving his family and talking excitedly about what he just saw			2
he adds that he hope @entity2 does n't put them on the naughty list for filming him			0
caught : @entity2 turns to face the camera and waggles his finger at @entity8 after spotting the hidden camera delighted : after the screen goes black , @entity8 turns to his family and claps his hands with glee @entity110 accomplished : the seven - year - old turns around and high - fives his family , celebrating a job well done			1
