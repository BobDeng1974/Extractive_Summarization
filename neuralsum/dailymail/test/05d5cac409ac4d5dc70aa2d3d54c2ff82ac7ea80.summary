he died at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 in march last year from ' intra-abdominal sepsis ' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault			1
@entity4 died at @entity7 ( pictured ) in @entity8 , @entity9 , in march last year from ' intra-abdominal sepsis ' after developing cerebral palsy following the the assault at an inquest into his death in @entity8 , coroner @entity16 said : ' on the balance of probability , mr @entity4 's health was compromised ( by the assault ) and he died earlier than expected			1
' a senior officer attended the hearing and said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person 's death if it happened more than a year before			2
but det con insp @entity31 said as mr @entity4 's injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force , fresh manslaughter charges could still be brought			2
the inquest heard that @entity4 , of @entity37 , @entity9 , was born an otherwise ' normal , healthy baby with no concerns ' in 1993 , but was shaken at just four weeks old			1
police are considering manslaughter charges after @entity4 died two decades after being assaulted as a four week old as a result of an injury to the brain , mr @entity4 developed severe cerebral palsy , epilepsy and visual impairment as well as learning , feeding and respiratory difficulties			1
he was admitted to @entity7 on march 4 of last year with jaundice and later died on march 25 after his condition deteriorated following a laparotomy to treat an intra-abdominal sepsis			2
his gp dr @entity55 said : ' there was no health concern at birth , but at four - weeks - old , @entity4 suffered from a non-accidental injury that led to learning difficulties , cerebral palsy muscle spasms , scoliosis , epilepsy , an unprotected airway and respiratory difficulties			1
' on march 4 , @entity4 was admitted to @entity7			2
he was slightly jaundiced but otherwise seemed well			0
' he was later admitted to @entity68 , but there was no clear source for his abdominal sepsis			0
the ' year and a day rule ' stated that an act was presumed not to have caused a person to die if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death			0
the ancient rule , which applied to death and suicide , was abolished under the @entity79 1996 amid medical advances			0
however , the permission of the attorney general is still required for any prosecution where it is claimed that the death occurred more than three years after the act , or when the offender has previously been convicted of an offence in connection with the death			0
' on march 12 , he was discharged by @entity68 onto the ward where his condition deteriorated before he died on march 25			0
' @entity93 attended the inquest to assess the assault mr @entity4 sustained as a baby to determine its significance in his death			1
he said : ' the question asked of us was if somebody would be prosecuted for manslaughter			0
' the adult who assaulted @entity4 when he was four weeks old was convicted and sent to prison for 12 months imprisonment			2
' @entity4 was shaken at four weeks old and his injuries resulted in ongoing health problems			1
' the assault was a deliberate act and , at the time , the question was whether the adult intended to cause grievous bodily harm			0
' in june 1996 , there was a law change to the " @entity118 " rule which stated an act was presumed not to have caused a person 's death if more than a year and a day had elapsed before death			0
' however , as the injuries were sustained in january 1993 , the rule still stands			0
' coroner @entity16 concluded the cause of @entity4 's death was ' intra-abdominal sepsis in an individual with severe cerebral palsy			1

@entity4 was born healthy but suffered on - going health complications
died at 21 last year having developed cerebral palsy following the assault
inquest in @entity8 , @entity9 , heard he was shaken at just four weeks old
