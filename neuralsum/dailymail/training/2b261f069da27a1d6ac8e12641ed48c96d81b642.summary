favourite night out : prince @entity0 leaving @entity1 it used to be @entity3			1
but now prince @entity0 has a new playground – a @entity8 - themed nightclub which hosts some of the wildest nights in @entity10			1
the club , called @entity1 , regularly features dancers dressed in bondage - style lingerie			2
a bottle of tequila costs £ 5,000 – and @entity17 clients can have their drinks delivered to their table by toy train			1
such is the 29 - year - old @entity0 ’s fondness for the place , earlier this month he was there on a monday , thursday and saturday , three nights out of the four that the club is open			1
arrangements have been made to try to ensure @entity0 is never photographed arriving , leaving , or at the club			1
non-vip visitors must obey a ‘ selfies - only ’ rule to protect him and other high - profile revellers from unwanted attention			0
it is a rule that is strictly enforced			0
on july 12 , at a @entity37 party , the club ’s co-owner , @entity34 , snatched phones from two excitable young @entity40 girls who had dared to point them in the direction of @entity0 as he breezed past them to join his entourage of friends in the tiny vip room			1
the girls ended up in tears and eventually their phones were returned , but only after the blurry photos were deleted			0
a discreet side entrance takes @entity0 from the @entity52 next door directly into the club ’s vip area , so he never has to walk past paparazzi			1
he even has use of a private marble bathroom			0
on the thursday night , @entity0 would have witnessed the club ’s famously bacchanalian @entity59 party , when dancers dressed in latex lingerie weave between flame throwers and customers , who are encouraged to interact			1
on mondays , @entity8 wrestlers tussle with each other , and also perform for guests queuing up outside in @entity40 ’s @entity52			2
@entity0 is often seen drinking shots with the barmen while topless men wearing giant skulls on their heads patrol the club with sparklers			1
prince @entity76 visited the club last year , and the @entity77 and @entity78 have also been spotted there			1
other celebrities seen enjoying the club ’s attractions include model @entity83 , @entity85 , @entity86 and singer @entity87 – and @entity0 ’s former girlfriend @entity88			1
once inside , thirsty guests can choose from the club ’s cocktail menu			2
if they choose a bottle of @entity94 from the @entity96 list , it will set them back £ 5,000			2
one of the club ’s large bottles of champagne is priced at £ 28,000			1
the club ’s signature drinks are frozen margaritas served in vessels shaped like @entity105 pyramids and @entity107 skulls			2
those who do n’t want to battle through the throng for their drinks can have the club ’s most expensive tequilas delivered to private tables on an electronic train called the @entity116			2
the pretty 25 - year - old works for the @entity130 , a landmine charity made famous by @entity0 ’s mother @entity132			1
she was famously photographed visiting a minefield in @entity135 which @entity130 workers were helping to clear			2
shortly before @entity0 and @entity126 were seen enjoying a kiss , the @entity0 had been seen chasing the young charity worker around the vip area brandishing an inflatable medal			2
the tiny vip room used by @entity0 has a special black curtain that is sometimes closed to stop drunken revellers from peeking in and causing a nuisance , although @entity0 rarely asks for it to be drawn			2
one regular at the club told @entity147 last night : ‘ if it was up to him , he would n’t even be in the vip room			0
’ private : the club 's entrance at the @entity52			1
prince @entity0 is said to take a more discreet entrance the @entity8 theme extends to the club ’s decoration , with walls covered in colourful graffiti			1
one sign reads , ‘ @entity160 is a sneaky bitch			0
one minute you are sexy dancing , the next you are on the floor , @entity164 making out with a shoe – @entity1			0
’ a popular saying on the club ’s @entity168 account is , ‘ one shot , two shot , three shot , floor ! ” a source said of the nightclub : ‘ @entity1 tends to be a pretty wild night out and can often get quite out of hand			2
but the staff there recognise the need for discretion and confidentiality when it comes to the club ’s vip guests			0
‘ quite often prince @entity0 can spend the whole night at the club without anyone knowing he is there			1
the vip area is tightly guarded and guests are given complete privacy			0
popular : @entity88 has also visited @entity1 ‘ it makes it much easier for celebrities to enjoy themselves , knowing that they wo n’t be photographed and gawped at			2
’ food at @entity1 includes @entity8 delicacies such as nachos , quesadillas , burritos and fajitas			0
they are served during a ‘ pre-dinner ’ sitting , after which the lights are dimmed and the restaurant tables are removed in order to create space on the dance floor			0
it ’s no surprise that the bizarre club – which translates as ‘ folly , foolery , nonsense or silliness ’ in @entity211 – is the brainchild of @entity0 ’s best friend , nightclub entrepreneur @entity213			1
he decided to open it after his last @entity40 venture , a club called public , closed down in 2012			0
he had spent a year battling with authorities to keep it open after it was branded a public nuisance and ‘ number one crime generator ’			0

in september last year , a video created by @entity213 and his @entity1 colleagues advertising their @entity59 club night had to be removed from @entity230 after violating the website ’s explicit content regulations			0
@entity213 did not appear in the film but was credited as its director			0
the offending video , which starred up - and - coming @entity238 model @entity239 , featured several scenes of nudity , sexual activity , bondage , sadism and masochism			0
a @entity1 spokesman insisted at the time that it was ‘ all in good fun ’			0
