the morning after the row the night before , @entity1 and @entity2 barely exchanged a word in the first - class cabin of their @entity6 flight to @entity8 , en route to the next race in @entity11			1
if the two @entity14 drivers are not quite on non-speaking terms , they are communicating only when they have to			1
while they kept quiet among themselves , both had a further say in public about the dispute that broke out after the @entity20			1
@entity1 was particularly strident saying that the difference is that he is a ‘ racer ’ and @entity2 is not			1
@entity1 ( right ) and @entity2 have both had their say on sunday 's @entity20 @entity26 ( centre ) waves to the crowd as @entity2 ( left ) and @entity29 shake hands briefly , the bones of the argument are these			1
@entity2 , who was beaten into second place by @entity1 , said his team - mate had been ‘ selfish ’ by slowing down while leading the race			1
it caused him ( @entity2 ) to be bunched up closer to the attacking @entity37 of @entity29 , whom he feared could overhaul him			1
@entity29 did not manage to do so and finished third			2
the verbal spat played out at the press conference as the two protagonists sat side by side			0
@entity1 smiled , seemingly happy to have riled his title rival			1
but it can now be revealed what happened after they finished their subsequent round of interviews in the @entity50 paddock on sunday night			1
both went through their usual engineering debriefs before being brought in one by one to meet senior @entity14 management including @entity54 and @entity55 , team principal and technical director respectively			1
@entity1 went in first and was in conversation with his bosses for half an hour			1
@entity2 for 20 minutes , now in a room illuminated by lights as darkness crept in outside			1
then , more than two hours after the race had finished , @entity54 was happy the team had got their story straight enough to speak to journalists			1
it was now 90 minutes after his scheduled press conference			0
@entity2 ( left ) was clearly angry with @entity1 in sunday 's press conference and hit out at his team - mate the @entity73 driver ( right ) denied he had done anything wrong following @entity2 's accusations @entity1 ( right ) backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team - mate 's race he declared the talks ‘ positive ’ and cleared both his drivers of wrongdoing			1
@entity1 then spoke to the press under an embargo that mean his words have not appeared until now			1
‘ @entity2 did n’t try , ’ he said with passion , often repeating his words for emphasis			1
‘ @entity2 did n’t try			1
‘ they said maybe he was just comfortable in second place and i said , “ well that ’s the difference between us			0
i want to win always			2
” ‘ and i would have done everything to get past today			0
or at least pushed for three laps			0
he was n’t quick enough			0
‘ this is motor racing , man			0
do n’t take away the fun of the racing			0
i would n’t have sat back two seconds to make it to the end of the stint			0
‘ i do n’t even know what @entity2 ’s point is			1
where we are is that i just won the race today			0
i did the best job i could possibly have done and the team got a one - two			2
’ @entity1 ’s explanation for slowing down is that he was running his own race and conserving his tyres as best suited him			2
no neutral i have spoken to within @entity111 disputes the world champion ’s rationale			0
@entity1 ( centre ) celebrates his win with the @entity14 team , but @entity2 ( right ) appears less pleased @entity1 crosses the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in @entity121 ‘ ultimately this is @entity111 , ’ added @entity1			1
‘ i want the guy to be up my a * * * if he ’s got the pace to be up my a * * * , and putting pressure on me			0
and if i ca n’t defend it , i lose , like in @entity11 last year			0
i was n’t quick enough and i did everything i could to stay ahead			2
and that was the greatest race ever			0
’ the greatest race of this young century , certainly			0
both drivers are now spending a few days in @entity8 before travelling to @entity11 for this year ’s race on sunday			2
before leaving , and without knowing what @entity1 had said , @entity2 offered his considered version of events through his customary post-race video , on which he answered fans ’ questions			1
one asked if he was ‘ crying ’ – by which the questioner meant moaning or being a poor loser			0
@entity2 said : ‘ you say that i was crying			2
ok , i respect your opinion , and i ’ll keep it in mind and i ’ll try to show respect when it ’s due going forward			0
’ @entity1 in front of team - mate @entity2 during sunday 's @entity20 in @entity50 @entity2 ( right ) speaks with @entity14 executive director @entity54 in @entity50 during the weekend but why did he not push to pass @entity26 ? ‘ it might not be so easy to understand from the outside , ’ said the @entity150			1
‘ but the reason is , i did try to attack @entity1 in the first stint , and it just did n’t work			2
all i did was destroy my tyres			0
‘ so in the second stint there was no point to do that again			0
i would have completely destroyed my tyres and @entity29 could have had a really good shot at overtaking me			0
my only chance of winning the race anyway , or to fight @entity1 , or try to overtake him , would have come at the end of the race , so that ’s what i was building up to			2
‘ the worst part of the weekend was losing out to @entity1 in qualifying			2
and it was by just four - hundredths			0
that ’s all down to me to be those five - hundredths quicker next time			0

@entity1 finished ahead of his team - mate to win the @entity20
