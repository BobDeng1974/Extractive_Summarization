mr @entity2 insisted he was not there so the boys could have fun playing football – he was ‘ only interested in winning ’			1

those who opposed him were ‘ weak - minded ’ and ‘ think sport is about knitting ’			0

' those that are not as good need to work harder or demonstrate more during training , or change sports			0
’ father - of three mr @entity2 , who runs @entity52 - based recruitment firm @entity51 , added : ‘ you are not doing your son any favours by suggesting the world is fair or non-competitive			1

' i call a spade a spade and everyone knows i do n’t like to dress things up			0
‘ that ’s just me			0
the fact is that we have got a weaker - minded group of individuals who think sport is about knitting			0
’ he claimed that many parents were told about the sacking before he was , and that the club had not given him the right of reply or opportunity to defend himself before making its decision			2
