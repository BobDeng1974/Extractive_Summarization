the era of hope is over			2
if the results of the @entity5 midterm elections have been a huge setback for the @entity7 , they were a personal catastrophe for @entity9			1
they were even worse than the most pessimistic forecasts of his party ’s strategists , amounting to a comprehensive rejection of his governance			2
with the @entity20 now in control of both the upper and lower houses of @entity23 , the twilight of @entity9 ’s presidency has begun			1
battered : president @entity9 's dire poll results had echoes of @entity27 's rising popularity in the @entity28 the man who once electrified the @entity5 nation with his soaring oratory – and titled his book on political philosophy @entity33 – is now the lamest of ducks in the @entity35 , mired in unpopularity and devoid of allies			1
in this election , @entity39 candidates saw him as a liability rather than an asset – with most of them running away from him like scalded cats			2
but the attempt to quarantine the president paid no dividends for his party			1
both the scale and geographical spread of their defeat was remarkable , with @entity7 losing @entity53 seats across the country , from @entity55 to @entity56			2
in former president @entity59 ’s home state of @entity60 , there are now two @entity20 senators for the first time since the 19th century , while the @entity20 now have their largest majority in the @entity35 since 1928			2
the president addresses the nation after speaking about the @entity5 midterm election results , where the @entity20 gained control of both houses of @entity23 the results are a reminder that @entity5 still retains its vast conservative heartlands			1
despite the reality of demographic change – with the black and @entity76 populations expanding rapidly – and all the talk about a progressive transformation of the country triggered by @entity9 ’s first election in 2008 , it is clear that a large swathe of the @entity5 electorate still holds to traditional values about the family , free enterprise and a limited role for government			1
indeed , in contrast to the optimism inspired by @entity9 in 2008 , a large majority of the public are profoundly concerned about the country ’s direction			1
one recent poll showed that 67 per cent of voters think that @entity5 is ‘ on the wrong track ’			1
several factors have contributed to this bleak mood			2
one is the perceived weakness in foreign policy			0
@entity5 might be fed up with war , but they are concerned about the seeming reluctance of the @entity35 to challenge effectively aggression overseas , whether it be by @entity105 in @entity106 or @entity108 extremists in the @entity109			1
the election proved to be a successful one for the @entity20			0
pictured are @entity20 @entity111 and his wife @entity112 celebrating results in @entity114 , @entity115 perhaps more important is the sluggish state of the @entity5 economy			1
just as in @entity28 , living standards have continued to fall despite a rise in employment			0
part of the great @entity5 dream has always been that , if you work hard , you will be able to build a better life for yourself and your family			1
this outlook has been central to the phenomenal success of @entity5 , where , until now , every generation has been wealthier than its predecessor			1
but now the dream is fading			0
even those who put in long hours now fear that they will be less well off than their parents – and for this , some of the blame is directed towards president @entity9			1
there is no doubt that , in 2008 , he inherited a desperately tough legacy from @entity142 , thanks to wars abroad and recession at home			0
in fact , as @entity146 , a former @entity147 , told me , no incoming president had faced a more difficult job since @entity152 in 1933 at the height of the @entity154			2
but after six years in power , @entity9 can no longer evade the responsibility for domestic and overseas failure			1
a further factor in the anti-democrat landslide was the greater cohesiveness and moderation from most @entity20 candidates			0
meanwhile the election proved to be a huge setback for the @entity7			0
pictured is @entity7 candidate @entity166 conceding to @entity20 candidate @entity167 in @entity168 in recent years , the @entity20 has sometimes given the impression that it is being held hostage by right - wing activists , a negative image fuelled by the influence of the hardline @entity175 movement			0
but now , after a period in the wilderness , the @entity20 seem to be getting the message about the need to fight on the centre ground and reflect the diversity of @entity5			1
interestingly , one of the most high profile congressional victories was that of @entity185 in @entity186 , the first @entity20 black woman to be elected to the @entity35			0
yet the @entity20 can not afford to be complacent			0
with turnout low and apathy prevalent , it would be wrong to exaggerate the implications of these results			2
one of the main reasons for the @entity20 ’ success is that their supporters were more galvanised to vote than @entity7			0
despite widespread disillusion with @entity9 , there is no evidence of an overwhelming transfer of allegiance to the @entity20			1
one recent survey showed that 59 per cent of voters are ‘ dissatisfied ’ with the @entity7 , but 60 per cent have similar feelings towards the @entity20			0
what we are witnessing is an accelerating distrust towards all mainstream politicians			0
it is a similar discontent with the political establishment that we see here in @entity28 , reflected in the rise of @entity27 and the mounting unpopularity of all main parties			2
( one opinion poll last week put the combined support for @entity215 and the @entity216 on just 59 per cent			0
) one recent survey showed that 59 per cent of voters are ‘ dissatisfied ’ with the @entity7 , but 60 per cent have similar feelings towards the @entity20 one person to benefit from all this is @entity220 , who is almost certain to be the @entity7 ’ candidate to succeed @entity9			1
she might benefit from the @entity20 domination of @entity23 – meaning that she can run as the challenger to the @entity225 establishment , just as @entity226 did in 1948 against the ‘ @entity23 ’			1
despite a health scare in 2012 when @entity220 suffered a blood clot , she is now fighting fit			0
she has built a formidable electoral machine and will run as a centrist moderate			0
for his part , @entity9 ’s last years in office will be a period of stagnation			1
his remoteness as an individual is in graphic contrast to @entity238 ’s easy charm , which enabled him to work successfully with a @entity39 - led @entity239 and the @entity53 in the 1980s , with deals often reached over a glass of whisky			0
but relations between the @entity225 parties today are more rancorous			0
crucially , deadlock in @entity225 is bad news for the wider world			0
we face huge global challenges , such as the threat of @entity251 and the ongoing collapse of the eurozone			0
@entity5 , still the world ’s greatest superpower , should be giving a lead to the @entity56 but is hopelessly divided and politically paralysed			1
and so the lame - duck president is now likely to spend even more time on the golf course because there is not much he can usefully do in the @entity35			2
last month , it was revealed that he had played 200 rounds since becoming president			2
there will be many more in the empty presidential days that lie ahead – even though turmoil rages elsewhere			0
@entity266 is a presenter on @entity267 the legalisation of marijuana in some parts of @entity5 may end up being the long - lasting legacy of @entity9 ’s presidency			1
@entity225 , @entity273 and @entity274 voted in favour of legalising the drug for recreational use by adults this week , following in the wake of @entity281 and @entity280			0
mr @entity9 has previously spoken on how he smoked cannabis in his youth and said he does not think it is any more dangerous than alcohol @entity20 are determined to dismantle mr @entity9 ’s controversial healthcare reform – his administration ’s biggest policy change – which would be humiliating for a president who says he is determined to leave a permanent mark on the @entity5			1
however , he has little to show for all his bold talk on foreign policy , the environment , immigration and the economy			0
despite marijuana ’s links to two deaths in @entity281 and growing scientific evidence that it is harmful to young people , pro-cannabis legalisers have been able to play on its value to cash - strapped states as a lucrative tax revenue source			0
mr @entity9 has spoken of how he smoked the drug in his youth and has said he does not think it is any more dangerous than alcohol			1
he agrees with reformers who say legalising cannabis would stop the stream of young black and @entity76 people who are jailed for possessing small amounts			0
even before he entered the @entity35 , mr @entity9 told historian @entity315 that he was intent on being remembered by history			1
‘ i have no desire to be one of those presidents who are just on the list – you see their pictures lined up on the wall … i really want to be a president who makes a difference , ’ he said .			2
