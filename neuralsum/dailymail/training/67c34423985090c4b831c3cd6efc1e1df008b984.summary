by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 5 november 2013 updated : 05:33 est , 6 november 2013 race days across the world are renowned for being glamorous occasions that offer a chance to dress up to the nines ... but there are always a few people who do n't get the memo			2
and so it was at this year 's @entity10 , where one or two racegoers were perhaps a bit too keen to let their hair down and flash the flesh			0
around 110,000 people were dressed to impress - and up for a drink			0
@entity46 racing events have long had a reputation for getting a bit messy as the day develops , but the hedonistic @entity50 crowds showed the @entity46 that they can party just as hard			2
both winners and losers made the most of the hospitality on offer and caused havoc around the racecourse			0
embrace : a couple clutch each other and their drinks towards the end of the event happiness : one of the 110,000 - strong crowd lies back and beams at the sun amidst plastic cups on the lawn pride : a poem was broadcast about the race that says ' we @entity70 are a funny lot , the things we hold so dear - like @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ... a glass of @entity78 ' funky chicken : in fascinators and formal dresses , these women display their party moves for the thousands debauched : two friends covered in cake jump on top of each other in time - honoured tradition before long , women were kicking their elegant heels off and donning silly hats , can of @entity78 in hand			1
others were seen being carried half - conscious			0
while some dance the limbo , one lady can be seen crawling onto the floor , while another wraps herself around her date passionately in the middle of the worn and torn field			0
and in a bid to win one of the fashion prizes awarded to men and women , the attendees doll themselves up in glitter , bright colours , low - cut dresses , and elaborate high heels			1
fashion has long been a central focus of the event - the mini skirt has one of its first major platforms at the cup 's @entity119 in 1965 when @entity121 attended and debuted her invention			1
party : these pictures would n't be out of place in a festival album - save the formalwear holding on : this group hold onto each other as they decide on their route out of the rubbish - strewn arena going ... : one reveller crawls over to the ground with her sunglasses falling off her face going ... : she topples but offers a grin in the spirit of the occassion , the highlight of @entity50 's spring carnival gone ... : she drops her face to the ground kicking her bare feet in the air with glee at the end of a long day flying high : she 's back up again to celebrate ( left ) , while one bet winner ( right ) leaps into his friends arms time out : one man gathers the strength to go on partying in a mid-race time out it is a far cry from the scenes in @entity157 , where even a hint of dresses creeping over the knee has you barred from the event entirely			2
this year the @entity163 took the title racing @entity70 - trained @entity165			1
it meant two @entity46 - trained horses - @entity168 and @entity169 - were pushed into second and third place			1
glitz and glamour : hems graze bottoms in the racecourse fashion trend worlds away from @entity177 's far cry from @entity179 : people in @entity181 have a strict dress code but in @entity70 they embrace fancy dress dramatic : women come clad in elaborate gold , spiky high heels in a bid to win the fashion prize pink ladies : these women themed their day as they arrive in matching wigs and glasses for the event @entity195 : two people throw bottles , jump and scream as they enjoy the party atmosphere mess : at the end , the public lawn is strewn with litter , people and birds looking for leftover food and drink the @entity10 is one of the richest flat races in the world with a total prize money pot of around £ 4 million			1
branded as the race that stops a nation , it has attracted riders , owners and horses from across the globe for decades			0
it started in 1861 , won by a horse named @entity218			2
in 1877 , the day was made a public holiday for @entity70 and @entity220			0
carnival : the attendees limbo during the annual event , branded as ' the race that stops a nation ' time of their lives : this woman grins as she inches towards the limbo pole with a champagne glass in her hand @entity232 carriage : one stiletto - clad lady gets some help making her way across the grass from two men playing around : one girl squeals as a group of lads lift her up in a thigh - grazing , skin - tight dress in 1986 , an @entity70 radio programme broadcast a poem , @entity10 , which celebrated the debauched affair			1
it says : ' we @entity70 are a funny lot , the things we hold so dear - like @entity251 , @entity75 , the @entity252 , a glass of @entity78			0
' last year , the trophy was presented by the @entity255 , who said it was a ' treat ' for her and the @entity257 to sit in the stands and watch some of the world ’s best jockeys compete			0
winner : @entity163 holds up the cup after coming first riding his @entity70 - trained horse , @entity165 the race : photographers gather from around the world for the race , which is an annual highlight for the sport @entity270 clearly enjoyed her day at the races during her first visit to @entity70 and even had a flutter on one of the favourites , @entity169 , according to ms @entity276			1
she met the horse ’s @entity46 rider @entity277 , a three - times champion jockey , in the weighing room and also in the field was @entity281 who rode @entity282 .			2
