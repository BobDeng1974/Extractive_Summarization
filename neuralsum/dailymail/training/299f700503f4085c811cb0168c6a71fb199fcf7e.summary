@entity0 revelled in the first match of the rest of his career with a 45 - minute clean sheet before wholesale half - time changes and a second period slump saw @entity7 settle for a score draw with @entity9 in scorching conditions			1
there were two sides to the @entity14 champions as @entity0 , entertaining ambitions of challenging @entity16 for the no 1 job and earning a @entity19 comeback , made his @entity7 debut			1
@entity21 started different teams in each half but @entity0 was certainly not treating the match like a bounce event as the @entity26 played host to a new beginning for the popular keeper			1
return : @entity0 was back in action for @entity7 after a long layoff from football @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity0 ( @entity33 46 ' ) ; @entity34 ( @entity35 46 ' ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 46 ' ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 46 ' ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 46 ' ) ; @entity42 ( @entity43 46 ' ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 46 ' ) ; @entity46 ( @entity47 46 ' ) , @entity48 ( @entity49 41 ' ) @entity50 ( @entity51 46 ' ) ; @entity52 ( @entity53 46 ' ) sporting all purple and the no 26 jersey , the 31 - year - old had n’t played a competitive game since april 2012 because of a succession of knee injury complications			1
this felt just like being back in the big time for the £ 9million man , even in the pre-season environment of a stadium less than half full			2
it was all of six minutes before he was required to use his invaluable full stretch , throwing himself right to claw away @entity69 ’s diagonal drive			1
‘ it felt like a big moment for me , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was an awkward shot to the far corner			2
when he hit it , i thought it was going to be more comfortable than it was			2
‘ it was full stretch in the end but i was happy at that , got a decent hand on it to keep it out and get it wide			2
it settled me down a little bit			2
‘ i was a little bit nervous but i get that before every game			2
friendlies can feel like not a proper game but it did in this place , a nice stadium , and it was noisy behind me			0
‘ that was probably good for me to help me concentrate on the game , an added help rather than a hindrance			0
it felt like a normal match			0
‘ i ’ve worked really hard over the past couple of years to get to this point and , although it was only 45 minutes , it ’s definitely a step in the right direction			1
’ on target : @entity48 opened the scoring for @entity7 in the first half @entity0 has been patient to build towards making his career comeback this season , including a lengthy training spell with @entity108 last term			1
his tolerance for waiting will have its limits , though , as he sets himself targets to play as much as possible to make up for lost time			0
‘ i just want to play games , ’ said the former @entity115 and @entity116 goalkeeper			0
‘ i ’ve done a reasonable amount of training over the past few months , since january			0
it ’s the game situations i am looking forward to getting into now			0
‘ that ’s what i want			0
doing that has been a large part of my life and not to have that over the past couple of years has been difficult			0
it was nice to get a piece of that back — then get a clean sheet			1
’ @entity131 replaced @entity0 at the break but there was one switch forced upon the manager that gave more cause for concern			1
as @entity0 put his injury woes well behind him , scorer @entity48 hobbled off just before the interval , nursing a thigh problem after a thudding challenge by over-physical @entity9 defender @entity143			1
@entity21 reported no ill effects thanks to the precautionary withdrawal and @entity48 should be passed fit for the @entity146 second qualifying round return leg against @entity148 at @entity149 on tuesday			1
the teams wore black armbands and observed a moment ’s silence before kick - off as a mark of respect for 10 people killed in a horrific motorway bus accident in the early hours of yesterday morning			1
new man : @entity21 is now looking ahead to @entity7 's @entity146 second round qualifier on tuesday the home crowd then cranked up the atmosphere , even though this was only a friendly , the bulk of the din coming from behind @entity0 ’s goal in the first half			1
that said , the comeback star ensured his defenders could understand his ire clearly			0
he certainly made himself heard as errant marking gifted @entity173 a chance , which he fluffed at the back post			0
@entity7 were smartly into the lead below a searing sun on eight minutes			1
@entity52 , playing through the middle , shielded the ball well with his back to goal and @entity48 read the signals to latch on to the lay - off with a sweetly struck , low left foot drive past an unsighted @entity185			2
this was the sixth match of @entity7 ’s new season and @entity21 had no wish to sap any energy from influential players ahead of what he hopes are five more @entity146 qualifiers			0
taking a cue from the @entity197 , there were water breaks midway through each half — not something that will trouble @entity7 in the domestic season			0
@entity9 , relegated to the third tier of the @entity204 game , start their league next week			0
so with tuesday ’s tie in mind — then either @entity206 or @entity207 ’s the following week — there was no surprise when @entity21 started an entirely different xi in the second half			0
that included @entity39 and @entity37 as a centre - half pairing , and @entity217 under - 21 international @entity216 — too often frustrated by taking a heavy touch — up front			2
much misfiring from the hosts had meant @entity0 was n’t relentlessly occupied			1
instead it was @entity131 who ended up picking the ball out of his net			0
@entity41 cleared @entity69 ’s clipped finish off the line but it fell to the feet of @entity228 , who took time to select his spot and fire home from six yards .			0

@entity0 keeps a clean sheet in long - awaited return
@entity235 scores after eight minutes before @entity236 equalise
