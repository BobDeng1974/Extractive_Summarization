‘ good luck finding a @entity13 , ’ smirked one of the bosses in the office when they asked me to choose the all - time greatest combined team from @entity5 , even as the @entity6 gird their loins for this week ’s revival of the most ancient fixture in football ’s international calendar			0
the assembling of a mighty composite xi ended up balancing six @entity17 with five @entity18			0
to squeeze in the highest feasible quota of superlative skills requires the selection of a majestic back three in a 3 - 3 - 1 - 3 formation			0
the starting point , beyond argument , is the @entity26 who just happens to be the world 's greatest ever goalkeeper : @entity31 - @entity30 winner in 1966 , immortalised by that flying save from @entity34 ’s leaping header , stands imposingly at the base of this awe - inspiring team			1
@entity37 - one of football ’s most cultured centre backs , in his golden years at @entity41 the most decorated of all @entity18 in the old @entity43 / @entity42			0
@entity31 won the @entity30 for @entity44 and makes the no 1 spot and @entity37 earns his spot @entity47 – the colossus at centre half for @entity50 , who he captained to @entity52 ’s first winning of the @entity53			1
@entity54 – one of the two greatest defenders of all time , in company with @entity59			2
the only @entity44 captain to raise the @entity30 aloft , his statue still guards the gates to @entity63 @entity64 's @entity47 ( left ) and @entity44 's soon - to - be @entity30 - winning captain @entity54 lead their sides out for a friendly at @entity63 in 1965 @entity68 – tackled like a vice , passed like a laser , scored when it mattered , one of the great all - time , all - round , most - feared midfield men @entity74 – as @entity75 for @entity76 and @entity44 , embodied all the @entity68 attributes and was the bravest of never - say - die competitors @entity68 was a tough tackling midfielder for @entity64 and here stands over @entity80 in 1985 @entity74 was @entity44 's @entity75 , winning 90 caps for his country @entity83 – not only the most creative of all @entity26 midfield players but also the scorer of stupendous goals , 49 of which still keep him in possession of the @entity44 record – after 44 years @entity90 – self - destructed before completely fulfilling his phenomenal potential but this maverick remains one of @entity44 ’s most naturally gifted prodigies @entity83 ( right ) , shooting against the @entity18 in 1965 , still holds the @entity44 goalscoring record with 49 @entity90 broke @entity18 hearts with this stupendous volley for @entity44 at @entity98 @entity99 – still the greatest of all @entity26 footballers , as deadly at centre forward as he was unplayable on the wing , quite simply a genius @entity104 – scorer of 237 goals for @entity76 and 30 in 55 games for @entity64 , the archetypal poacher - striker , widely held to be his country ’s second best player ever and their only winner of the @entity112			1
@entity99 heads the ball towards goal in a game against @entity64 at @entity63 in 1953 @entity104 celebrates scoring for @entity64 against @entity44 in 1968 @entity116 – the @entity13 , maker and taker of wondrous goals , both conductor and virtuoso of the team , football ’s @entity122			1
subs : @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 apologies – to countless others who have made our game so beautiful			0
@entity116 , beating @entity134 in the air in 1973 , is the best player to have pulled on a @entity64 shirt			2

@entity44 's @entity30 winners @entity31 , @entity54 and @entity83 make the team
@entity50 's @entity53 winning captain @entity47 plays at the back
@entity104 , @entity116 and @entity99 lead the attack
