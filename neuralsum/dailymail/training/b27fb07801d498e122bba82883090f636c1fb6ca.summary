upset : @entity0 was told to take down the @entity1 from his house in @entity3 , @entity4 an ex-serviceman was forced to remove a flagpole flying a @entity1 from his garden after neighbours complained it was ‘ too noisy ’			1
@entity0 , from @entity3 , @entity4 , raised the flag for the first time last week but within days was asked to take it down			1

mr @entity0 said : ' it ’s the first time i have heard our national flag being described as offensive to look at			1
' i had only managed to raise the flag five or six times before the phone rang to say it had to come down			2
' we all have rights but surely mine count as much as theirs			0
the least my landlord could have done was to come and see me and the flag for themselves			2
' it ’s not causing anybody any harm			0
' another of mr @entity0 ’s neighbours complained that she could n’t watch the television while his flag was flying			1
' if she wants to watch the television , she should concentrate on that instead of my flag , ' he said			2
' mr @entity0 joined the @entity47 through @entity48 in 1952 before being transferred to serve as a sergeant in the @entity50 in 1954			1
the pensioner says he takes pride in being patriotic			0
mr @entity0 's landlord @entity14 told him to remove the flag from his garden , pictured , following complaints from neighbours he said : ' maybe i am more patriotic than the average person			1
' when i watch the military parades on television , i have a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes			0
' i ’ve always wanted a flag but i ’ve never had a garden to fly one in until now , and i think it makes my garden look nicer			2
' i ’m proud to be an @entity72 and proud to have been in the forces , so i want to fly my flag , it ’s as simple as that			0
' mr @entity0 says he even checked whether he needed planning permission for the flagpole , which is 18ft tall , and hangs his 5ft by 3ft @entity1 flag			1
he and his wife @entity79 , 68 , moved to their bungalow 18 months ago after having problems with their neighbours at their previous home , where they lived for 26 years			1
he said : ' we find it very idyllic living here , it ’s like our little piece of heaven			0
but this has really ruined things for us			0
' i ’ve been totally upset by the whole thing , i ca n’t believe people can take so much offence over our country ’s flag			0
' i hope people will see that there are much bigger things to be worried about , rather than stopping an old man from taking pride in his heritage			0
' @entity105 , local head of housing operations for @entity14 , said : ' mr and mrs @entity107 are a lovely couple to work with , and we understand that they have the best of intentions			0
' objections were about the size of the flag and the noise it created , not the principle of flying one , and we are more than happy to help the @entity120 come to a suitable agreement with their neighbours			2
