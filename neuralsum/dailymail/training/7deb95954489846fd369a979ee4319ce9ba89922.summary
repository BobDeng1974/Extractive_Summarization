' law is biased ' : dr @entity1 was told he must pay maintenance to his ex-wife a @entity5 hospital consultant was told yesterday that he must pay his ex-wife maintenance even though under @entity8 rules he believes he owes her nothing			1
a judge told dr @entity12 that he must follow ‘ the rule in this country ’ and share his money			1
the @entity17 decision means dr @entity1 must pay £ 60,000 to his former wife , academic @entity18			1
the ruling sounded a warning to @entity5 couples who believe their marriages are ordered according to sharia law and agree to be bound by @entity8 courts			1
@entity25 told dr @entity1 : ‘ the rule in this country is that you share and the starting point is equal division			1
‘ you came out of the marriage without having made your wife any substantial capital payment			2
’ he added : ‘ life is sometimes hard ; do not be consumed with bitterness			2
’ but dr @entity1 said after the case : ‘ by playing the system and pretending to be a victim she got everything , which i think is totally unfair			2
‘ family law in this country is biased against @entity5 people			1
’ the consultant rheumatologist at @entity45 in @entity46 , who is also the head of the @entity48 in the resort town , was married for eight years , and the couple had two children			2
the marriage was formalised following the @entity8 tradition of @entity54 , under which the groom pays a gift to his bride			2
because of this , his wife had signed away her share of the couple ’s home in @entity65 , in @entity45			0
dr @entity1 also assumed he had no obligation to make maintenance payments , and that , following @entity8 practice , his former wife ’s family would support her			1
however , after the marriage fell apart in 2008 , a county court judge ordered him to pay £ 60,000 to his wife in a hearing to settle the legal terms of their break - up			1
dr @entity12 worked as a consultant rheumatologist at @entity45 in @entity46 dr @entity1 made payments for only four months but then contested the decision			1
in the @entity17 , he told @entity25 that he had stopped paying because he had heard his former wife had inherited £ 250,000 from her father and had become ‘ very , very well off ’			1
dr @entity1 , who represented himself , told the court : ‘ i have nothing but respect for the court ’s order , but i only stopped paying because all her family were telling me she ’s got millions			1
she does n’t need it			0
’ archbishop of @entity91 dr @entity90 broke open the controversy over sharia divorce in february 2008 when he appeared to recommend giving islamic law force in @entity96 courts			1
he said in a lecture that the idea that one law could claim the allegiance of every group in the country was ‘ a bit of a danger ’			1
he suggested sharia courts might have authority over divorce and financial matters for @entity5			2
the archbishop added : ‘ this introduces into our thinking about law what some would see as a market element , a competition for loyalty			0
’ the row led to questions over dr @entity90 ’s future and to a number of senior liberal lawyers backing the call for official power for @entity8 courts			1
dr @entity90 and others pointed to @entity130 @entity129 courts , which settle disputes among @entity132 , but only when all parties have agreed to be bound by the decisions of the tribunal			0
however the idea of giving power to sharia courts attracted severe criticism from lawyers and politicians who thought women could be bullied into accepting unfair settlements			0
but the judge said the doctor had been determined not to pay because ‘ he felt the payments were illegitimate or illegal according to @entity8 culture ’			1
@entity25 said : ‘ the husband has kept the whole of the capital in the marital home and the wife has not received any of it			0
‘ in those circumstances the order for spousal maintenance was a perfectly proper and fair order to make			0
’ the judge added : ‘ the husband has to try to understand that inherited wealth is not available for distribution , especially when it comes in after or shortly before the breakdown of the marriage			0
' that would not reduce the husband ’s obligation to make a proper contribution to his wife			0
’ ‘ i must dismiss this application , ’ @entity25 said			0
an unknown number of @entity5 couples take their family disputes to sharia tribunals , usually run under the umbrella of local mosques			1
there are said to be around 85 operating in @entity178			0
they operate voluntarily , but critics say women may be disadvantaged if they agree to accept @entity8 rules			2
at present , if a sharia court settles a marriage dispute , an official law court has to approve the arrangement before the divorce is finalised			0
the judge must decide whether it is reasonable and ensure neither party is disadvantaged			0
but agreements are submitted to the family court on a form just two pages long			0
the couple do not need to attend court			0
the great majority are approved and critics say this process can amount to no more than rubber - stamping			0
four years ago archbishop of @entity91 dr @entity90 caused controversy when he said that full acceptance of sharia courts ‘ seems unavoidable ’ .			2

dr @entity12 told he must follow ' the rule in this country '
ordered to pay £ 60,000 to his former wife , academic @entity18
he felt the payments were illegitimate according to @entity8 culture
