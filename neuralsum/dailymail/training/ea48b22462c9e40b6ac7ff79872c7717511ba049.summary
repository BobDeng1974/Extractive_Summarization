support for staff and pupils : a @entity11 statement said it was an ' extraordinarily sad and difficult time ' reasoning : the school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the children to have a non-uniform day for @entity15 , and he had requested that pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing firm stance : @entity11 refused to let its pupils wear a charity bracelet in support of the pupil every day this was planned for april 11 , but the school also told pupils that the bracelets could only be sold and worn on that day - a policy which has caused much anger among the children			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we spoke to students and said that they could show their support by attaching the bracelets to bags or keys but not wear them as bracelets , in order to comply with our policies			2
' we called the police who supported us in evaluating the safety of staff and students , which is paramount to us ' @entity11 spokesman ‘ this has been the topic of quite extensive social media comment over the last two days , culminating in a call from students and parents for students to strike yesterday			1
‘ although this was a largely peaceful event , we called the police who supported us in evaluating the safety of staff and students , which is paramount to us			1

punishment : the school said it explained to the students how it was helping @entity15 and his family , and those who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost learning time during detentions but the spokesman continued : ‘ there were a small minority of students whose actions can only be described as anti-social and potentially dangerous who used this as an opportunity to be disruptive			1
‘ these students were putting pressure on others not to go back into classrooms and contacted the press			0
we will be evaluating the actions we will be taking with these students over the next few days			0
’ ' the only resolution i can see is if the school back down because the pupils are very passionate about this , and i ca n’t see them letting it go ’ @entity47 , mother the facebook page ' spotted : @entity155 ' has been inundated with angry comments since the ban on bracelets was announced			2
