forecasters say the surf may not return for several days as the entire @entity21 coast experiences similar conditions			1
' there 's a real high pressure system that 's sitting over the @entity37 and extending over @entity21			1
' mr @entity27 said the warm weather meant there was no low pressure systems around to build up some swell and was affecting areas as far as @entity43 on the north coast of @entity21			1
' @entity45 looks like it 's slightly higher ( than @entity3 ) but even that 's not high , ' he said			2
' there 's very light winds on the coast at the moment so there 's no wind waves being generated closer to the beach , ' mr @entity27 said			2
' it 's probably fairly common when there 's very stable weather			0
' but it would vary during different parts of the day – in the afternoon there 's more likely to be a sea breeze			0
' the waves are expected to pick back up later this week			0
' we 're expecting a bit of a change on wednesday with a southerly wind and a bit of a temperature drop , ' mr @entity27 said			1
