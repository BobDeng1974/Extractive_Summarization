after passing the sign reading ' @entity5 , ' @entity1 artist @entity0 and dog @entity2 lead visitors to the ' spaceport ' he has built in his backyard out of wine bottles and cement			1
it 's no wonder the lanky 69 - year - old embraces the real @entity13 in his town 's backyard , the world 's first space base built expressly for commercial launches and soon - to - be site of the first space flights with sir @entity22 's @entity21			1
' it is hard for locals to realize the impact it is going to have , but it is slow coming and this is a tiny little town , ' said @entity0			0
but he has no doubt ' things are happening			0
' final preparations : @entity33 , @entity1 , is preparing to welcome the world 's first space tourists after a decade of construction work at the $ 212 million @entity13 comes to an end the inaugural flight of the six - passenger @entity39 should take place this year , carrying @entity22 from the 12,000 - foot runway to suborbital space about 65 miles from @entity44			1
' as always , safety will ultimately call the shots , but right now , i â€™m planning to go to space in 2014 ! ' @entity22 wrote in an e-mail this week			1
the first of some 700 ' astronauts , ' who have already paid $ 250,000 for the two - hour - plus flight and some minutes of weightlessness , should follow a month later			1
final sight on @entity44 : a sign for @entity13 's main runway is seen in front of the @entity58 to @entity59 near @entity33 , @entity1 unique design : the roofline of @entity13 blends into the landscape near @entity33 , @entity1 , while one of the bases own firetrucks is parked outside the distinctive structure soaring : @entity21 's first generation of commercial space vehicles will take - off into space and land from the @entity1 base by the end of 2014 almost there : the world 's first purpose - built commercial space base and soon - to - be site of the first space flights with sir @entity22 's @entity21 is near to completion at @entity33 in @entity1 after 10 years of conception and construction at the state - run , taxpayer - funded , $ 212 - million @entity83 , the people of @entity33 , population 6,500 , are sensing a shift in confidence as the countdown nears			1
while the economic windfall is difficult to estimate for the town that famously renamed itself after a radio quiz show in 1950 , most everyone in these parts agrees the @entity83 should inject new energy into the somewhat tattered and totally quirky t or @entity94 , as it is known in local parlance			0
' there might have been some doubt about how much @entity33 would be ready for all of this future endeavor , ' said @entity99 , who bought and renovated a motel with wife @entity101 a few years ago and called it , aptly , @entity102			2
' i think that in the last few months that shifted ... that maybe we can pull up and measure up , ' she added , noting that the virgin team is helping the hospitality industry spiffy up			0
ground control : the main runway mission control is seen at @entity13 while ( right ) a picture from 2011 shows a gangway inside the structure from which passengers will be able to see the spaceplane protected : a view of the perimeter fence of @entity13 near @entity33 , @entity1 where the inaugural flight into suborbital space should happen later this year and the first astronauts , who have made reservations and paid $ 250,000 for the flight , should follow a month later welcome : guests stand outside the new @entity13 hangar in 2011 as @entity124 billionaire @entity22 dedicated the newly completed terminal monday where his @entity21 is slated to begin his commercial space tourism venture there 's a new @entity129 north of town , next to where a spaceport visitors center will go up			1
it is not yet known where @entity21 will lodge the astronauts for three days of training			1
it could choose the bigger town of @entity138 to the south			0
but @entity141 or @entity94 's townspeople are particularly proud that @entity142 , the media mogul turned conservationist and local rancher , bought the historic @entity145 last year , citing myriad reasons , including @entity83 , his friend @entity22 and the famous waters of the dusty town once called @entity33			1
the 30 - mile drive out to @entity13 over the sparsely populated high desert plain is a journey through time			1
@entity156 roamed here some 12,000 years ago , the @entity155 built the @entity158 passage here , a century - old dam across the @entity154 brought settlement and @entity161 made it a gigantic area of restricted air space			2
while @entity83 brings a futuristic vision to the old @entity166 , it is meant to blend in			0
the signature building , designed by the firm of @entity124 architect sir @entity169 , melds into the distant mountains like a giant portobello mushroom			0
preparing for boom times : the town of @entity33 , @entity1 is expecting to grow when @entity13 launches primitive form of travel : a man cycles into the town of @entity33 while motels expect to see no more vacancy 's by this time next year feeding time for astronauts : a man walks past the @entity182 in @entity33 , @entity1 i am ready to meet their leadrrs : artist @entity0 , 69 , stands by a sign at his home in @entity33			1
while it 's not clear what the economic impact will be , many agree that @entity13 should inject new energy into the town ' it feels much more real , but it also feels like i am looking at something that is a set for a science - fiction movie , ' said visitor @entity198 while on the @entity200 tour to @entity83 after hearing @entity22 would go to space soon			1
the fact that the spaceport is more than half an hour 's drive from anywhere complicates matters			0
the spaceport has to have its own water supply , fire trucks and resident crew of firefighters , for example			0
@entity22 is n't the only famous entrepreneur here			2
he is joined by @entity215 's @entity214 , founded in 2002 with the ultimate goal of sending people to inhabit other planets			0
@entity214 , which already has craft supplying the @entity220 , has chosen @entity83 to test the @entity222 reusable rocket , meaning that it will launch vertically and then land intact			0
' it really is the democratization of space , ' said spaceport executive director @entity225 , ' that you and i and our children and grandchildren can think about going to space , about going to @entity232			0
' @entity233 closer : @entity234 ( @entity235 ) and sir @entity22 stand next to a model as @entity21 unveils its new @entity39 spacecraft in 2009 @entity13 's @entity58 to @entity59 is seen at the end of the road to the main runway , near @entity33 , @entity1 on may 1 , 2014 she estimates there will be 200,000 visitors per year to @entity83 ' when all our customers are flying			1
' those kinds of numbers are feeding the first shoots of space business , from @entity250 's psychedelic t - shirts sporting a cowboy - on - rocket motif to follow the @entity200 's new @entity253 tour base where freeze - dried ice cream is for sale and there is extra space for start - ups to operate			1
' we do n't know where the opportunities are going to be , we just know a facility like this will line us up , ' said follow the @entity200 's @entity264 , echoing the kind of wonder around town about where this all could lead			2
then there is that lingering question of whether @entity33 can preserve the quirky character and @entity273 ruggedness that has attracted free spirits and artists for decades			2
' my guess is that the real culture and heritage of @entity280 is pretty firmly ingrained , ' said @entity21 ceo @entity281			2
' i would doubt that just because we start doing our spaceflights the intrinsic character changes			0
' @entity0 , the artist , relishes the ' nice mini-culture embedded in a trailer town , ' and said @entity83 should n't detract from its charms , but rather attract more interest in them			0
if he gets a free ticket , @entity0 is game to go to space , but only ' if @entity2 would come with me			0
' ticket cost : the starting price for flights is $ 250,000 - the first ceremonial flight will be undertaken by @entity22 and his family = training : passengers are required to go through a ' @entity300 ' , including three days of pre-flight preparing onsite at the spaceport to ensure passengers are physically and mentally fit to fly once aboard : @entity39 will carry six passengers and two pilots			1
each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead			2
the space ship is 60ft long with a 90in diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity flight path : a climb to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites			2
passengers become ' astronauts ' when they reach the @entity322 line , the boundary of @entity44 's atmosphere , at which point @entity39 separates from its carrier aircraft , @entity327 the spaceship will make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness , with the entire flight lasting approximately 3.5 hours			1
the spaceship accelerates to approximately 3,000 mph - or nearly four times the speed of sound flight frequency : initially one per week , eventually to have two flights per day			0

in the @entity1 town of @entity33 , the *multi-million* *dollar* @entity13 is preparing to open and welcome the first commercial launches
@entity21 boss , @entity22 , will take his family aboard the six - passenger @entity39 by the year 's end
more than *650* astronauts have paid upwards of $ 250,000 for the *privilege* of flying into space
@entity13 is the first base built for commercial launches and is expected to *transform* the town of @entity33
