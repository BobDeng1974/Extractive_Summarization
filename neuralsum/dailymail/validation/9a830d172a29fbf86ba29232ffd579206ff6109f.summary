decades ago i found myself working with a young woman with autism			1
i had done my reading of the autism texts of the time , and was singularly surprised when nothing i had read matched up to the person i was sat next to			1
there was no flapping , she had no interest in my earrings or buttons , and she certainly was n't even lining anything up			2
we know so much more about autism now but the idea that all people with autism are disordered , impaired , or somehow ' lesser ' is one that still needs to be challenged			1
this includes two of my best doctoral students who both graduated successfully and are now prominent in their respective fields			2
some of the strongest marriages i have encountered are between people with autism , and i have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic			1
@entity37 is there such a stigma surrounding autism ? so , the question remains , why is it that autism continues to be seen as a disorder , with terms such as ' impaired functioning ' still so rife within the literature and current diagnostic manuals ? why is it that one needs to present as a ' problem ' before being in a position to be identified as autistic ? even the term ' diagnosis ' brings along its own associations with ' illness ' or ' disease '			1
surely , this gives out the wrong message to all involved – parents , individuals , and the public			2
for years , i have been suggesting ' identification ' as a more appropriate term , which counters the pejorative language so often heard in reference to autism			1
without doubt being autistic in a world populated in the main by people who are not can cause huge issues for the individual and their family			1
but this is not the same as suggesting that the problems are caused by being autistic			0
the very fact that there are plenty of autistic individuals who are hugely successful demonstrates that being autistic does not preclude anything at all			2
actors @entity77 and @entity79 , and singer @entity24 are to name but a few , while others have retrospectively identified other potential big names such as @entity83			0
the curse of bad @entity85 some research has shown poor outcomes for people with autism but there have been fewer evaluations using real - world measures such as employability , self - sufficiency and social support			1
some of the ways we measure ability may also be problematic – take memory and learning , for example			0
the task support hypothesis – the idea that situations can be created for individuals with autism that capitalise on their areas of strength – can lead to situations where the ability to remember is increased			2
@entity111 , who finished fourth on the tenth season of @entity113 , was diagnosed with asperger syndrome shortly after his father died , when he was nine			0
the actress @entity79 ( right ) has autism the sad fact is that there are still schools of thought that deny the fact that people with autism can lead very successful lives			1
comments such as ' she will never be able to have children ' , or ' he will never go to university ' are still way too prevalent			0
parents of newly identified children are still sometimes told what the future will hold , despite the fact that no one has a crystal ball			0
perhaps many of the problems stem from being in a poorly understood minority group , rather than directly from being autistic ? moving forward nonetheless , things are changing for the better , however slowly			0
the @entity140 , for example , promotes employment for people with autism			1
the @entity143 is working to ensure a level playing field in the workplace , although there is some way to go before this is fully realised			0
' some of the strongest marriages i have encountered are between people with autism , and i have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic , ' says dr @entity25 at the @entity153 at @entity154 we 've been working to further these initial advances ; to continue to promote a more accepting view of autism and to encourage society to recognise the potential of autistic individuals			1
one of the courses we run in collaboration with the @entity140 has welcomed a plethora of autistic speakers , guest lecturers and autistic students who share insight and expertise			0
so , have perceptions changed over the years ? well , for absolute certainty i can say that mine have			0
i no longer assume that all publications are correct , and recognise that all autistic people are individuals			2
i have learnt to challenge the notion of impairment and disorder , while still recognising the huge challenges faced by individuals and families			0
i have begun to recognise the damage that can be done by ignorance and misinformation			0
and i have learnt that changing perceptions through a better understanding of autism can significantly improve lives , and the best way to develop an understanding of autism is to listen to those who are autistic , their families and friends			2
in terms of general perception – well , society is certainly moving slowly in the right direction , with more and more autistic people self - advocating and promoting their strengths , but there is an awful long way to go			1

@entity25 is a senior lecturer in autism at @entity154
he questions why autism is still thought of as an *inevitable* disability
*argues* that people in some of the strongest marriages and most successful jobs have autism - and they are kind , caring and loyal
