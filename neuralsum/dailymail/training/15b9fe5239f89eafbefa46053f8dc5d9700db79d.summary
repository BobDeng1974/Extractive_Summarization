by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 14:26 est , 21 january 2013 as questions go , it was a simple one			2
after seeing posts about a recent refurbishment at a nightclub , one clubber asked if the toilets had also been given a makeover			1
but instead of answering the query politely , a representative of the club told her to ' p * * * off '			1
conversation : at first , the club 's representative on @entity17 was civil ( left ) but the exchange quickly took a turn for the worse rude : the representative said ms @entity22 was ' not wanted ' at @entity23 before telling her to ' p * * * off ' @entity22 visited the nightclub , @entity25 , in @entity26 on @entity27 and was appalled by the state of its filthy and broken toilets , which were stained with faeces and vomit			1
when she read about the recent refurbishment on the club 's @entity17 page , she posted a message asking whether the toilets had been improved			1
ms @entity22 received a private message back , which read : ‘ @entity22 maybe would have been better to send us a private message re toilets			1
’ the exchange quickly turned nasty , however , when the admin told her to ' p * * * off ' and that her custom was no longer welcome in the club			1
@entity47 : ms @entity22 had visited the club on @entity27 and found the toilets in a filthy state ( pictured ) ms @entity22 , 22 , from @entity26 , responded by saying that she was going to tell everyone via social media about @entity23 's customer service and posted the conversation on @entity55			1
the representative asked for her phone number but the damage had already been done			1
ms @entity22 claims the owners of the club have since ‘ bombarded ’ her friend @entity61 with calls after she tagged them in the picture online			1
on her @entity55 account , she says a pr representative for the club has since contacted her to claim their @entity17 account was hacked			2
in a @entity70 post , ms @entity61 , 21 , explains : ‘ today was very interesting			2
a friend and i successfully created a ( very small ) twitter storm about the appalling customer service provided by @entity25 nightclub in @entity26			2
‘ for some context - my friend @entity22 visited the club on @entity27			1
apparently , it 's a very respectable place but the toilets were like something out of @entity80			2
‘ when the club posted about their refurbishment , my friend politely asked if they 'd also refurbed the toilets - nothing implied , no rudeness , and not even a mention of how they looked on @entity27			1
‘ the manager ( or whatever cretin runs their @entity17 account ) decided to send her some pretty bad abuse			0
‘ i thought this was pretty shocking , and decided to do my bit by sharing the photo and tagging @entity23 in the process			0
they promptly untagged , and decided to harass me with calls			0
‘ when i answered , the lady spoke in a hushed voice , claiming that their account had been hacked and could i take the photo down immediately			0
obviously , i did n't comply			0
’ @entity102 of the conversation have now gone viral and the hashtag # justwantedtoknowaboutthetoilets is fast spreading on @entity55 , with the original post being retweeted hundreds of times			0
backlash : @entity23 ( pictured ) has claimed that somebody hacked their @entity17 account and sent the messages @entity23 have since removed their @entity17 and @entity55 accounts			0
@entity111 , club host at @entity23 , explained several people had access to the club 's @entity17 page and that anyone could have posted the messages			0
he said : ‘ my guess is as good as yours as to who posted this			0
we think someone with access to the page has intervened in a conversation and told @entity22 to p * * * * off			1
‘ obviously , no one wants to be spoken to like that and we have messaged @entity22 to apologise and to offer her down to the club for a vip night			2
but since she wo n't give us her number , we have n't been able to speak to her directly			0
‘ this has all been blown out of proportion and a lot of the posts about us have been very silly and immature			0
we do n't want people going around giving the club a bad name but there 's only so many times we can apologise			0
