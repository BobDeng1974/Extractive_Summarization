by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 19:20 est , 12 august 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 13 august 2013 @entity2 and @entity3 have almost doubled their lead over @entity6 for stewardship of the economy			1
according to a survey , 40 per cent believe the prime minister and @entity11 are more capable of managing the economy than @entity13 and @entity14			1
just 24 per cent said the @entity6 leader and @entity11 have the right answers – giving the @entity17 a 16 per cent lead			1
economic competence : the @entity21 lead over @entity6 for running the economy has soared from nine points in june to 16 points in august pm @entity2 , left , and chancellor @entity3 , right , have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility , according to the survey it is a dramatic increase from a lead of just nine points last month , and will send shockwaves through the @entity6 as mr @entity13 prepares for another relaunch			1
from april to june the economy grew by 0.6 per cent , double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013			0
new @entity36 governor @entity35 last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent			0
@entity17 have been careful not to declare they can see ‘ green shoots ’ of recovery , with mr @entity3 insisting the economy has moved only from ‘ repair to recovery ’			0
with growth up and unemployment down , @entity6 has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government , having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘ too far , too fast ’			1
mr @entity13 's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy			1
but the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the @entity21 leadership ’s economic strategy			0
according to the latest @entity56 survey for the @entity57 , the @entity21 lead for ‘ competence ’ on the economy is at its highest level since december 2012			0
pressure : after three weeks of almost complete silence from the @entity6 leadership , the poll will be another blow for @entity13 and @entity14 ( right ) to make things worse for @entity6 , the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall , it is only just			1
on voting intentions mr @entity13 ’s party leads by just 3 per cent , with 35 per cent saying they will vote @entity6 compared with 32 per cent for the conservatives			1
factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent			0
the @entity17 have fallen four points over the last month and @entity6 has gone down 1 per cent			1
the poll is the latest blow for mr @entity13 , who is expected to return to the political fray this week with an attack on the government for falling wages in real terms			2
he has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench , leaving the coalition to set the political agenda			0
a much - hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher @entity96 turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking @entity99 and @entity100 had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts			0
@entity105 's former pollster @entity104 said the speech was ‘ symptomatic of a bigger problem ’ for @entity6 - ‘ an apparent lack of an overarching strategy ’			2
‘ it seemed to be a tactical opportunity seized - rightly or wrongly - rather than something that 's part of a bigger story from @entity6 , and i think what we need is to hear the bigger story , and that 's what we 're not really getting at the moment , ’ she told @entity109 's @entity110			2
she warned that @entity6 was ‘ slightly lurching from one announcement to the next , or complete silence ’			2
‘ what voters need to hear is some real clarity about what @entity6 stands for , what @entity6 believes , how @entity6 now would be different from how @entity6 has been before			2
and that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a language that people understand			0
‘ i do n't buy the argument that we need to hold all our important announcements back because i think we 're leaving it to the point that people have so little to go on about @entity6 that they 're almost not noticing @entity6 , and the party has to define itself very clearly now to people or it will be defined by its opponents			2
’ the @entity56 poll shows @entity142 has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent			0
the poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year , compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse			1
a quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year .			0

just 24 **%** said @entity6 leader and @entity11 have the answers
result will heap pressure on @entity13 ahead of fresh relaunch
17 **%** also think their personal financial circumstances have improved
