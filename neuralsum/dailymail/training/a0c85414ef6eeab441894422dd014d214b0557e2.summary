by @entity0 published : 18:43 est , 4 august 2013 @entity2 : 02:38 est , 5 august 2013 @entity4 ’s election strategist came under fire last night after it emerged that he was plotting a campaign to discredit @entity8 councillors			2
@entity9 was reported to have discussed mounting a ‘ below - the - radar ’ campaign to target members of @entity8			1
in a meeting with a lobbying firm , he is said to have suggested monitoring the party ’s 139 councillors and trying to catch them making embarrassing comments in council meetings – which would then be leaked to the press by third parties			0
attack : @entity22 , left , has criticised conservative campaign guru @entity23 after accusations he planned to discredit @entity8 councillors by filming them making embarrassing comments the revelations sparked an angry response from @entity8 leader @entity22 , who said the conservative party ‘ quite clearly does not trust its own membership ’			1
he suggested that @entity33 activists ‘ have enormous sympathy ’ for what his party is trying to do			1
mr @entity9 is also said to have criticised the controversial @entity37 scheme in which adverts on vans tell illegal immigrants to ‘ go home ’ or face arrest			1
he says it played into mr @entity22 ’s hands by giving him publicity			1
the @entity8 leader said the vans , which sparked accusations of racism , were ‘ nasty ’			1
mr @entity9 told executives at @entity50 , a @entity52 - based lobbying firm , the initiative had backfired by becoming a row about ‘ tactics ’			2
he said an opportunity to attract voters who would actually support such a crackdown had been missed			0
a senior @entity33 denied this was the view of mr @entity9 – who is on a £ 200,000 contract to run the party ’s campaign for the 2015 election			1
he also denied there were plans to monitor @entity8 councillors			2
controversial : the @entity37 vans that target illegal immigrants : @entity33 sources have denied that mr @entity9 was behind the vans scheme any suggestion that the @entity71 are rattled by @entity8 will pile pressure on mr @entity4 ahead of next year ’s @entity74 elections in which the @entity76 party are set to achieve their best result			1
@entity33 mps with small majorities fear they may lose their seats if they are targeted by @entity8 in 2015 and it splits the right - wing vote			1
last night mr @entity22 said : ‘ what is most revealing about mr @entity9 ’s line of attack is that he wants to bring in outside consultants to keep a watch on the hundreds of @entity8 councillors , rather than trusting the @entity33 ’ own elected councillors			1
of course if they listened to their own activists they would find , just as the @entity92 would , that their own activists have enormous sympathy for what @entity8 are trying to do – to wrest power from the political elite and put it back where it belongs , in the hands of the men and women of this country			2
’ despite speculation from mps that mr @entity9 was behind the vans idea , @entity33 sources insisted the £ 10,000 campaign to target illegal immigrants was the idea of the @entity37 , saying mr @entity9 does not get involved in policy			1
the advert states : ‘ in the @entity109 illegally ? go home or face arrest			0
text home to 78070 for free advice , and help with travel documents			0
we can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention			0
’ it has already been publicly condemned by the @entity122 , while @entity33 mp @entity123 said : ‘ the breathtaking stupidity of the people in charge of our immigration system knows no bounds … the fact is there is absolutely zero effort made by law - enforcement agencies to get people out when they have come in to the country unlawfully			0
’ two vans will be driven around the @entity52 boroughs of @entity140 , @entity141 & @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 , displaying figures on how many illegal migrants have been arrested recently in each area			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ i will confirm that i was approached by @entity150 to have a meeting to discuss a range of political issues			2
they raised a number of issues , it was a private meeting			0
somebody is being deliberately mischievous			0
’ @entity157 , director of @entity50 , said : ‘ people in politics chit - chat about strategy , moan about their opponents and bounce ideas around all the time			0
it would be a grave mistake to read too much into a matey midsummer chinwag			0
’ a @entity168 poll for @entity169 this weekend puts the conservatives on 32 per cent , six points behind @entity92 , while @entity8 is on 13 per cent , three points ahead of the @entity122 .			0

@entity9 also said the vans telling illegal immigrants to ' go home ' played into @entity8 leader *'s* hands
mr @entity22 said @entity33 members have ' sympathy ' for what his party is doing
