by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 17 june 2012 updated : 13:42 est , 17 june 2012 when fully operational , it will be the world 's largest offshore wind farm - and , as these pictures show , work on the project in the @entity6 is moving along at quite a pace			2
the wind farm , which is being built in the shallow waters 12 miles off the coasts of @entity11 and @entity12 , which , when complete will feature 217 turbines that will be able to supply enough electricity to power a quarter of @entity16 's homes			1
the £ 1.7 billion wind farm , known as the @entity18 , is owned by the utility companies @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and is expected to start sending energy to the @entity24 next spring			1
the first phase of the project will generate 630 megawatts of power - equivalent to a small gas or coal fired power station and enough to supply 470,000 homes			2
corridors of power : when complete , the @entity18 wind farm will be the largest in the world vast : the £ 1.7 billion @entity18 wind farm will feature 217 turbines when complete the second phase will bring the total to 217 turbines , each towering 147 metres above the estuary , giving 1000 mw of power , enough for 750,000 homes			1
work on the project began in january			0
it was originally given the go - ahead in may 2009			0
at present , the world 's largest offshore wind farm is the 102 - turbine @entity47 project , located off the coast of @entity49			0
the @entity47 project is capable of providing sufficient electricity for about 320,000 homes			0
work in progress : construction work takes place on one of the wind turbines in the @entity6 estuarine energy : the turbines , in the @entity6 , will eventually be able to generate enough electricity for 750,000 homes			1

when complete , the £ 1.7 billion project in the @entity6 will boast 217 turbines
it will be able to generate enough electricity for 750,000 homes
set to be *connected* to the @entity24 next spring
