as you step off the plane in @entity3 , a nurse stops you and takes your temperature			2
another forces you to wash your hands with alcoholic hand gel , before a third questions you on which countries you 've visited in the last few months			2
it ’s a remarkable feat that this competition is taking place at all			2
it ’s been just two months since @entity15 confirmed that they would not be hosting the tournament , and only 64 days since @entity18 stepped in as the hosts			1
people gather outside the @entity21 before opening match between @entity18 and @entity23 the opening ceremony for the @entity25 gets underway at the @entity21 @entity26 of balloons are released to celebrate the grand opening of the tournament in @entity18 even for a country with the infrastructure already in place that would prove a tough task – and here it still feels like a near impossibility as the football gets underway			1
while @entity3 and @entity37 , the two larger cities , hosted games in the 2012 edition of the @entity10 , for @entity41 and @entity42 were less than prepared			0
the pitch in @entity42 , birthplace of the @entity46 - @entity45 president @entity44 , now looks pristine , but it was a mess just a few days ago , and there can be little confidence about how it will hold up after 180 minutes of football on monday			1
dancers perform at the @entity21 ahead of the first game of the @entity25 workers put up flags of @entity56 countries competing in the @entity57 of nations near @entity59 in @entity37 and when the tournament leaves town , having provided the town with six group games and a quarter final , the 8,000 inhabitants will have themselves a 10,000 capacity stadium			1
away from the stadiums , there are other major concerns			0
while @entity3 is reasonably well - stocked with hotel rooms , finding a place to stay in @entity37 is proving a real difficulty , not just for the fans and journalists that have made it out here , but for the teams			1
@entity10 veteran @entity80 , the @entity23 manager in his at his eighth tournament , branded it ‘ unacceptable ’ when his side arrived at their hotel to find there were no beds for seven of the party of 35			1
in @entity90 turned up to find that the power had gone down			2
when it returned , three and a half hours later , the players discovered , to their disgust , that the hotel had no running water , no bed sheets or towels , no televisions and no soap			0
streamers are released as the crowds gather in @entity18 in @entity42 , meanwhile , the four teams face drawing lots to decide who gets to use the one available practice pitch at any given time			1
none of this seems to matter very much to the locals , particularly in @entity3 where the @entity10 seems to have snuck up on everyone			0
ask a taxi - driver if they are planning to go to any of the games and the most you get is a shrugged ‘ maybe ’			0
travelling fans are rarely a feature of the competition , and despite the president ’s attempt to boost attendances by providing 40,000 free tickets , it is hard to see how any matches , bar those involving the hosts , will come close to capacity			1
the exception to the low - key build - up came from a group of @entity132 migrant workers , who , it seems , decided to take it upon themselves to make @entity3 feel like a city hosting a continental competition			0
@entity137 will have to make do without @entity138 ( left ) after the defender was ruled out through injury as we sat in a coffee shop in the centre of the town on friday , a cacophony of noise interrupted the city ’s quiet anticipation			1
around 150 @entity132 fans , clad head - to - foot in yellow , waving flags and scarves and standing on the back of six or seven pick - up trucks , screamed their support for their country			0
the convoy honked their horns loudly , bringing the traffic – difficult to negotiate at the best of times – to a complete standstill			0
for ten minutes we were treated to the noise , passion and colour one associates with @entity56 football – before the convoy moved on to greet their heroes at the airport , and calm again descended on the capital			0
against this backdrop , a tournament that is notoriously difficult to predict at the best of times , has become impossible to call			2
the conditions for the favourites @entity137 , out in @entity42 , could prove a real hindrance to their chances , despite the incredible array of attacking talent they possess			1
@entity184 striker @entity183 withdrew from the @entity186 squad because of a problem with his back they kick - off their campaign tomorrow against @entity186 , also blessed with a wide selection of forwards ( despite the withdrawal of @entity184 star @entity183 ) , perhaps the best front - line in the tournament , but have struggled to find a tactical balance recently			1
with a strong but unpredictable @entity205 side , managed by former @entity201 boss @entity200 , alongside them in group c , and the much - improved @entity203 , the group in the remote corner of the jungle could turn into a real scrap			0
two other fancied sides , @entity207 and @entity208 , have the benefit of being based in fancy hotels in @entity3 , and playing all their games in the rather beautiful stadium just south of the city in @entity214			2
the @entity217 , however , for all their @entity216 talent , looked woeful at times in qualifying , and a friendly defeat to a weak @entity221 side this week does not suggest they have done much to improve			0
however , with @entity223 stars past present and future in their line - up , with @entity226 joining @entity227 and @entity228 , they have the firepower to go a long way if everything clicks			0
brothers @entity228 ( left ) and @entity227 ( right ) will be hoping the @entity208 can go all the way to the final new @entity223 recruit @entity226 will hopeful of bringing his fine domestic form to the tournament but the most remarkable team based in the capital are @entity18 , the squad whose presence is a constant reminder of what this tournament has accomplished , simply to be happening			1
as you drive back into town from the stadium , amid the billboards advertising flights to @entity37 and showing off the new mascot @entity251 ( a squirrel which looks suspiciously like a porcupine ) , one slogan is repeated constantly			0
‘ @entity254 ’ – everyone against @entity254			0
for the @entity45 , who qualified against all odds while their country was ravaged by the outbreak , this will be an emotional tournament			2
the tournament 's squirrel mascot @entity251 is raring to go despite looking more like a @entity263 they are determined to make their country famous for matters on the pitch , rather than as a medical disaster			2
it has become clear that 64 days is not long enough to plan and deliver a tournament of this magnitude			1
what is a relief for all involved , from @entity274 to the players , and certainly the fans , is that now , finally , we can stop talking about the preparations , and start talking about the football			0
@entity281 's players sit before a training session at the @entity37 stadium in @entity18 @entity132 supporter gestures and blows a vuvuzela horn upon the arrival of @entity132 's team at @entity3 airport			1

@entity18 have had just 64 days to prepare for the tournament
president @entity44 given away 40,000 free tickets to local
