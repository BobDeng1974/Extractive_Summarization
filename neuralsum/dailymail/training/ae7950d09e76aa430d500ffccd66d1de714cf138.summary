her owners found her trapped on sunday afternoon owner @entity13 , 22 , desperately attempted to free the dog - but failed and called fire services @entity8 was so firmly stuck in the six inch gap that even with @entity28 , her brother @entity29 , 28 , and neighbour @entity30 , 30 , pushing they were unable to free her			1

yesterday @entity8 's owner , a beauty consultant , said : ' i could n't believe it			2
i was out in the garden and my neighbour was there			0

' i called my brother as he is a builder so i thought he would have some tools to help			0
