and the title of @entity34 soldier is just the lie of fools , ' he said in the email			1

the horror that is @entity34 is disgusting			0
' @entity0 latched onto the email as proof that @entity1 should n't have handed over suspected terrorists to the @entity37 to get @entity4 released			1
' no , mr. president , a soldier expressing horrid @entity109 beliefs – even boldly putting them in writing and unabashedly firing off his messages while in uniform , just three days before he left his unit on foot – is not " honorable service			0

during an interview with @entity146 , @entity0 called @entity1 ' weak ' and accused him of undervaluing the service of the nation 's men and women in uniform			2
