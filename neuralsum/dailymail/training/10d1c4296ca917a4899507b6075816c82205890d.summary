by @entity0 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity4 ’s parents @entity1 and @entity2 have watched him play 77 matches at @entity6 — not always from their vantage point yesterday , inside the @entity8 — but his victory over @entity11 @entity10 was as simple as any			1
@entity12 has never been to the third round of a @entity14			0
when his chance came around he found himself staring across the net at the greatest player ever to wield a racquet in an arena where @entity4 is adored			1
balanced : @entity4 took just 81 minutes to beat @entity10 tennis royalty : @entity4 's mother @entity1 watches him , sat next to @entity22 in the box the seven - time champion sniffed out his opponent ’s nerves and broke him after seven minutes at the first opportunity — 1hr14mins later he broke him again to seal a 6 - 3 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 victory			1
@entity10 ’s compatriot @entity29 could have supplied a few words of warning if solicited beforehand			1
@entity4 has beaten him seven times			1
@entity4 has beaten more opponents than anyone playing the game			2
as he ages and his bones begin to creak he finds new ways to win			0

‘ i ’m very pleased to get through because i ’m aware of the danger of certain players on grass , ’ said @entity4			2
‘ i ’ve been able to get it done here many times before but not always as we saw last time			0
‘ i ’m maintaining a good level of play , physically i ’m in good shape — a few niggling things but nothing that worries me — i ’m playing aggressively and serving well			0
’ in the fourth round , @entity4 faces @entity82 @entity81 who beat him at the same stage in last year ’s @entity84			2
