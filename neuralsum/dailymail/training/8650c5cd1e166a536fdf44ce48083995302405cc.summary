by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob faith healers , psychiatrists , psychologists : @entity4 have tried them at various times			1
but maybe there is one ingredient missing from this year ’s @entity10 preparations			2
@entity11 , the newly signed @entity12 striker , might suggest @entity14 ’s pre-season routine of walking over hot coals as a means to inspire the team			1
for @entity11 credits @entity14 ’s pre-season training camp , during which manager @entity19 persuaded him to walk across the hot coals , as the reason for the extraordinary season that has seen him make his @entity4 debut and earn his £ 4million move to @entity12			1
living the dream : @entity11 ( left ) celebrates scoring for @entity4 against @entity25 ‘ @entity19 got some fella in to try and give you that winning mentality , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ it was very interesting			0
one of his methods was to walk across burning coal bare footed			0
it was a challenge , mind over matter			0
you knew nothing worse could happen to you during the season			2
’ it clearly did @entity14 no harm , as it propelled them to eighth in the table			0
but @entity11 does believe that the amount of conditioning and training undergone during pre-season under @entity19 is responsible for the presence of three @entity14 players in this @entity4 squad , with @entity45 and @entity46 also included ‘ that was the easy part walking on hot coals , ’ said @entity11 , 32 , who spent most of his career in the lower leagues but who now can hope to play in the @entity10 finals			1
‘ that was a relaxing afternoon			0
@entity19 took us away for 18 days to do all the conditioning work			1
inspired : @entity19 used walking across hot coals as a technique to get the best from @entity11 ‘ the pre-season he gave us was horrendous to do , but it benefitted us all , especially @entity61			1
it gave him an extra yard of pace , an extra bit of strength. , he 's always had the skill , he 's always had the vision			2
he 's always had everything but ( this season ) he was able to shrug people off and he was able to run past people			1
‘ i am not saying he was slow last year or anything like that , but that 's what i 've noticed the most			2
he 's always been able to do everything else , but the fitness and the sharpness that the gaffer put into him is what i think has pushed him onto the next level			0
’ @entity19 , as an @entity83 , might be an unlikely @entity4 hero ; then again , he was the man who tripped @entity84 in 2002 to give away the penalty which @entity86 converted for when @entity4 to beat @entity87			1
pochettino it is who has helped turn @entity11 , whose career had taken in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 , into an international player			2
‘ i had never really been taught how to play as a lone striker , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ i never really got taught to be a striker in the first place and then i never got taught how to be a lone striker			0
the thing that i was doing wrong most was the fact i thought i had to show for everyone on the pitch			0
‘ whoever had the ball , i felt i had to run over and show for the ball , get on the ball			0
he was saying : “ take your time to wait until the right people have got onto the ball , like @entity61 and others further up the pitch			0
” @entity115 : the former @entity14 striker will play his football for @entity12 next season after a £ 4m move that 's when you become effective and when you can make your movement , get on the ball and just channel all my efforts into the right places			1
after that , i had an understanding of how to play that position a lot better			0
’ @entity11 , of course , was rejected by @entity12 as a teenager but now will be returning to his home - town club after the @entity10 , which means he can finally be open about that tattoo on his right shoulder			1
‘ it ’s a @entity12 tattoo and i got it after the 2005 @entity138 victory			2
i was at @entity95 at the time			0
i did n’t go to the final but i managed to go to every home game in the @entity138			0
the semi-final against @entity143 was the best atmosphere i have witnessed in my life			0
’ ladder : the 32 - year - old spent most of his career battling through the lower leagues up until now , he has been coy about it , even hiding it from the likes of his @entity4 and @entity12 captain , @entity153			1
‘ i do n’t want to come across as a mad fan ! ’ said @entity11			2
‘ i ’ve had to play it cool but the more i got involved with @entity4 , i did ask them ( the @entity12 players ) more questions about the manager and about how the club is run			1
‘ they have had nothing but good words to say , especially about @entity163			0
but that was before i knew there was any interest			0
i was a @entity12 fan just wanting to know how things were doing there			2
’ history : @entity12 fan , @entity11 has a tattoo in honour of his team 's 2005 @entity138 success			1

@entity11 cites @entity19 's inspirational management techniques for his dream season
@entity11 has sealed £ 4million move to *boyhood* club @entity12
32 - year - old striker will also play a part in @entity4 's @entity184 campaign
