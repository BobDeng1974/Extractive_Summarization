by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 08:27 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 09:10 est , 7 august 2013 the @entity2 is to spend £ 6million on a ' youth camp ' to promote @entity4 days before crucial elections			2
eurocrats are accused of ‘ nothing short of bribery ’ by organising the event for 5,000 16 to 30 - year - olds ahead as voters prepare to go to the polls to elect new @entity13			1
the bizarre event includes role play games , concerts and ‘ idea labs ’ to debate youth unemployment in the @entity2 ’s @entity20 headquarters			2
party venue : the @entity22 in @entity20 will host the @entity23 next may , just weeks before @entity25 elections the event has attracted controversy because it seeks to ‘ strengthening a participative @entity22 democracy ’ just before elections to the @entity2 in may 2014			1
young people will be chosen by charities , youth groups and the @entity2 ’s offices across @entity34			1
but more than 700 @entity13 will also be able to sponsor 10 young people each to send to the event , which it is claimed could breach rules on ‘ treating ’ voters during election time			1
the event , which is set to cost £ 1,200 per head , is linked to @entity43 and organisers hope to attract heads of state and ‘ renowned personalities ’ from across the continent			0
@entity49 mep @entity48 said : ‘ this is @entity2 largesse at its most breath - taking			2
‘ sending impressionable young people on a taxpayer - funded trip a few days before an election is nothing short of bribery			1
‘ the @entity2 's authorities have really misjudged this idea			0
’ the extraordinary use of public funds comes after @entity61 declared war on @entity64 waste , brandishing a colouring book at a summit which showed how it takes four @entity6 to send a letter and depicting them travelling around town in taxpayer - funded limousines			0
the plans for the event on may 9 - 11 next year include a televised question and answer session with the candidates running to be president of the @entity77 , meets with heads of state or governments and an open air concert			2
there will be a ' @entity82 ' outside the @entity2 and a street festival of cultural performances across @entity20			2
stages will be erected for dance and sports performances			0
role play games will allow young people to ‘ step into the shoes of @entity22 decisionmakers , lobbyists or media - makers ’			1
waste : prime minister @entity61 has used repeated visits to @entity20 and @entity4 to call for an end to extravagant spending there will also be a @entity100 competition and networking events based on ‘ an adapted form of speed dating ’			0
mr @entity48 added : ‘ young people want the @entity64 to help them into work , not to fly a hand - picked selection to @entity20 for a busman 's holiday			1
‘ with 23 per cent of under 25s unemployed in the @entity64 , i can think of many more useful things to spend this money on like training and apprenticeships			0
‘ at a cost per person of £ 1,200 , this event will reinforce the view among @entity118 taxpayers that the @entity2 wastes their money			0
‘ these pet projects have to stop			0
the @entity2 's authorities have really misjudged this idea and should think again			0
encouraging debate and youth participation is a good thing , but it should be done for a fraction of the cost , outside of election time and in a location with far better and cheaper transport links than @entity20			0
’ controversy : sitting @entity13 will be able to take up to 10 people to the three - day event , just weeks before seeking re-election the taxpayer could pick up the bill for some groups to travel to @entity138 , and even pay for meals			1
others will pay for their own travel			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ @entity143 will give the young people who are amongst the hardest hit by the crisis the opportunity to actively engage in a dialogue about ways of improving their chances			2
‘ the @entity2 will open its doors to young people from all over the @entity64 and invite them to meet with inspired thinkers and speakers with a wide range of professional experience to exchange ideas and perspectives on youth - related issues , develop new , innovative ways and solutions to crucial questions for the future and experience the rich cultural diversity within the @entity64 through the staging of various cultural performances			1
‘ young people will be invited to get actively involved in all activities throughout the event : developing and formulating new ideas for a better @entity34 in various formats and shaping parts of the programme with their own contributions ; and drafting the final report for presentation to the newly elected @entity13			1

three - day event for 5,000 16 - 30 - year - olds to be staged in @entity20
every mep will be able to take 10 young people days before elections
*critics* claim it could be in breach of rules on ' treating ' voters
