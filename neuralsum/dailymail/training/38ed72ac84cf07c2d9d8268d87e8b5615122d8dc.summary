by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 30 january 2013 updated : 20:47 est , 30 january 2013 confident : @entity1 said @entity3 's withdrawal will not stop the waste management programme being successful @entity6 ’s long - term nuclear plans have been thrown into disarray after the only county willing to store radioactive waste pulled out of the running			1
@entity11 voted against studying the possibility of building a £ 12billion underground dump in the region , over fears it could damage tourism			1
ministers branded the decision disappointing , while unions representing nuclear workers said the move was ‘ short - sighted ’			2
the decision is a blow to the coalition ’s plans to develop a new generation of nuclear reactors , as it will have to either convince another authority to host the site or hope that @entity3 will change its mind			1
although radioactive waste is currently kept in surface storage , the government is committed to creating a long - term underground facility			1
it has also pledged that future nuclear power station would only be built if ‘ effective arrangements ’ for dumping were in place			2
proponents of nuclear power fear that without these plans for waste burial , any new stations would almost certainly be subject to legal challenges			1
speaking after yesterday ’s decision , @entity3 council leader @entity45 said : ‘ @entity3 is not the best place geologically in the @entity6 - the government ’s efforts need to be focused on disposing of the waste underground in the safest place , not the easiest			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity3 has a unique and world - renowned landscape which needs to be cherished and protected			2
' while @entity55 and the @entity56 have co-existed @entity57 successfully for decades , we fear that if the area becomes known in the national conscience as the place where nuclear waste is stored underground , the @entity56 ’s reputation may not be so resilient			1
’ if the area becomes associated with nuclear waste ' the @entity56 's reputation may not be so resilient ' says council boss @entity68 leader @entity45 said as @entity3 already has @entity55 nuclear plant , any more nuclear facilities in the area could damage the @entity56 's reputation energy secretary @entity1 said : ‘ i am confident that the programme to manage radioactive waste safely will ultimately be successful , and that the decisions made in @entity3 today will not undermine prospects for new nuclear power stations			1
’ he added : ‘ we remain firmly committed to geological disposal as the right policy for the long - term , safe and secure management of radioactive waste			2
' we also remain committed to the principles of voluntarism and a community - led approach			0
’ @entity6 currently has ten nuclear power stations , generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity , around 19 per cent of @entity6 ’s electricity needs			0
by 2023 , all but one - @entity88 in @entity89 - will have become obsolete			0
this could trigger an energy crisis , as one third of @entity6 ’s old - fashioned coal - fired and oil - fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time			0
in october , @entity97 engineering giant @entity96 paid £ 700million to take on a project to construct plants in @entity100 and @entity101 , boosting government plans for a new network of atomic power stations			0
but @entity107 energy campaigner @entity105 last night warned that without adequate waste facilities , no new plants can be built			0
‘ even the prime minister admits we need a plan to store waste before we can build a single new plant			0
this decision shows that dumping waste in uncertain geology near one of the country ’s most pristine national parks is not a solution , ’ she said			0
‘ ministers must now re-consider their nuclear ambitions and turn their attention instead to clean , sustainable and renewable energy			0

@entity3 was the only county left in the running to host an underground nuclear waste facility
council leaders *vetoed* plans over fears the area would be associated with nuclear waste , rather than the @entity56
