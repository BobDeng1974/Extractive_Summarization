for @entity1 , this is no time to think about the future			1
not when the present delivers so many challenges			0
@entity5 has made clear his wish for the 19 - year - old @entity7 to spend a second season on loan from @entity10			1
any such plans are , however , being parked by @entity1 while he concentrates on a packed schedule confronting @entity13 as they pursue success on four fronts			1
saturday ’s victory was the centre - half ’s first competitive appearance in almost two months following a foot injury			1
@entity1 made his @entity13 return after two months out with a foot injury he played an important role in a solid , efficient display , which was gilded by two fine goals that pushed the champions to within two points of leaders @entity28 with two games in hand			1
@entity5 ’s men now face two more @entity33 games this week before a seismic @entity34 semi-final against @entity36 at @entity37			1
a @entity39 tie against @entity40 and @entity41 encounters with @entity42 then swiftly follow			0
meeting those demands is the focus for @entity1 , who has also had to contend with personal sadness following the tragic loss of his childhood friend @entity47			2
the @entity49 player — a team - mate in the @entity7 under - 21 side — was killed in a car crash nine days ago			2
‘ i need to wait until the end of the season and see what happens , ’ said @entity1 , when asked about the possibility of another year at @entity13			1
‘ there are a lot of things in my head at the moment and i just need to concentrate on playing games			0
’ @entity1 ( left ) pictured in action against @entity63 ( second right ) while training with @entity64 the feedback from @entity10 about his loan has been positive , albeit with recognition of the gulf between their respective environments			1
‘ the club has said i am doing well here but the objective in the @entity33 in @entity74 for @entity10 is different and is at a much higher level , ’ he added			1
‘ so i need to do more again but we will see at the end of the season what happens			2
’ when @entity1 first joined @entity13 back in august , no one would have expected @entity5 ’s team to be anywhere but the top of the table come mid-january			1
the defender jokes that a genuine contest with @entity28 extending into late april would be ‘ too long ’ , but for now it is viewed as a positive			2
@entity1 hopes the increased pressure they currently face in the @entity33 could also bring the welcome spin - off of ensuring minds stay sharp in the other competitions			1
‘ is there a hunger in the team ? yes , because we need to win all our games , ’ he insisted			2
‘ we need to be focused in every game , we have to play every game at the maximum level			0
we are not leading by many points as is normal			0
we are now second and it ’s really competitive			0
it is good for the league			0
@entity1 , a defender , has impressed during his loan spell at @entity13 from @entity10 ‘ we now have to play every game at the maximum level but , if we were leading by a number of points , we would not have to			1
‘ it was nice to play a game			0
i feel good and felt no pain			0
the injury has gone and i can now do everything 100 per cent			0
’ @entity1 came close to netting an own goal as a header from @entity117 ’ interim player - manager @entity118 caused a moment of first - half chaos			1
he was spared by the reactions of @entity122 , who then produced an outstanding block on the follow - up to deny @entity125			0
there had been a stodginess about much of @entity13 ’s early play — following last week ’s training camp in @entity130 — but their breakthough goal after 33 minutes was a thing of wonder			2
@entity135 edged the ball on to @entity137 , who had the presence of mind to lay a first - time pass in front of the overlapping @entity143			0
the right - back caught it perfectly , sending an unstoppable , swerving shot beyond @entity146 from 20 yards			0
@entity13 manager @entity5 wants to extend @entity1 's loan deal into a second year at @entity13 @entity117 would have felt well in the game at half - time but conceded within five minutes of the restart			1
again , @entity143 was involved , delivering a deep cross from the right that found its way to fellow full - back @entity154 at the far post			0
he picked out @entity157 and the 18 - year - old midfielder wheeled to make a sweet connection with a left - foot snapshot that zipped inside @entity146 ’s right - hand post			1
@entity162 twice spotted a way back into the match for @entity117 , but was denied by another smart stop from @entity122 before misdirecting a free header off target			0
from here on in , most of the attention was focused on commons			0
the match had been billed in some quarters as his last for @entity13 amid persistent interest from @entity175 , with his name chanted by the visiting support before he made way for @entity179 with 10 minutes remaining			2
the full - time whistle then delivered a scene that seemed to confirm what was happening			0
commons threw his boots into the @entity13 fans in what , for all the world , looked like a fond farewell gift			2
@entity190 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity191 ( right ) after putting @entity13 ahead against @entity117 @entity5 denied that was the case and insisted the 31 - year - old — stuck in a contract impasse — would have to source a new pair as he was going nowhere for the rest of the season			1
that , however , seems unlikely to be the final word on this particular saga with a fortnight still to run in the current transfer window			0
on and off the field , the coming weeks will go a long way to shaping @entity13 ’s season .			1
