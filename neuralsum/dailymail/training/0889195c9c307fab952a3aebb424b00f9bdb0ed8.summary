by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 8:47 pm on 28th june 2011 one day he 'll be king - but today @entity4 's future monarch yielded to his new bride to join in a crowd wave			1
@entity7 of @entity8 proved her power as queen of @entity11 today as she convinced prince @entity12 to join in the wave			1
the @entity12 was clearly uncomfortable as he raised his arms halfway in unison with the rest of the @entity18 crowd while a grinning @entity20 looked proudly on			0
the couple were on hand to watch their countryman @entity23 roar to victory against @entity27 @entity26 in straight sets			1
@entity23 celebrated victor with an extravagant bow towards @entity20 and @entity12 in the @entity31			1
never mind the royal wave ... @entity20 , @entity20 looks expectantly over at her husband as she raises her arms for the @entity36 wave on @entity11 here 's the @entity36 one : the second in line to the throne gets in to the spirit of the occasion your majesty : @entity4 number one @entity23 bows to the @entity46 and @entity20 following his victory over @entity26 in their fourth round match at @entity18 in turn , they gave him their seal of approval with a pat on the back after the match , won in @entity58 heat on court , and told him : ' well done			1
' @entity23 said : ' if i 'd known they were coming , i would have shaved			2
i was thinking to myself as i came off i was sweaty and very hairy			0
i said to them , " i 'm sorry , i 'm a bit sweaty "			0
but it was very nice to get to meet them			0
' the bow , he said , was ' just , yeah , sort of off the cuff			0
did n't think too much about it '			0
he added : ' i was obviously very happy after the match			0
i think it was the right thing to do			0
' the win earns @entity23 a quarter - final clash tomorrow with the @entity76 @entity75			1
happy couple : the @entity46 and @entity20 sitting in the royal box on @entity11 at @entity18 pretty layering : @entity20 followed @entity18 's specification that players must wear white @entity12 and @entity20 became the surprise stars of the @entity31 after weeks of speculation that they might attend before embarking on their tour of @entity87 tomorrow			1
@entity11 was crammed to capacity , which equates to 15,000 bums on seats			0
but to widespread disappointment , none , alas , was @entity93 's			2
for although there were frantic rumours during the morning that @entity20 's little sister and former maid of honour would arrive with the royal party , @entity93 - watch was stood down at 12.31pm when the celebrated rear failed to emerge from the police - escorted cavalcade			1
@entity20 , a huge fan of the game , wore what looked to be a triple - decker tennis skirt – in fact a £ 795 @entity106 dress – teamed with @entity109 nude court shoes			1
within half an hour of her appearance , the frock , reduced to £ 395 in the summer sale , had sold out on the designer 's website			1
unusual detailing : the white disks on @entity20 's shoulders will remind @entity18 fans of a less successful recent fashion statement ... @entity121 ' @entity120 jacket which was covered in white tennis balls the royal spectators clapped and cheered as @entity23 got to grips with the heat			1
later , during @entity126 's match , they would even join in a @entity36 wave			2
@entity23 's triumph was followed by despair from the @entity131 sisters who made a shock exit from the tournament in the fourth round			1
@entity131 ' attempt to win a sixth @entity18 title ended in the fourth round with a 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 loss to @entity139 of @entity140			1
the 23 - year - old @entity139 beat @entity131 at @entity18 last year by the same score to reach her first @entity143 semifinal			1
she also won their first - round match at the @entity145 in 2006			2
@entity131 ' defeat came shortly after younger sister @entity147 also went out in the fourth round , losing to @entity148			1
it is the first time since 2006 that neither sister has reached the @entity18 quarterfinals			0
expert in action : @entity23 drew in an a-list crowd for his match on @entity11 today fan club : @entity23 's girlfriend @entity157 and his mum , @entity158 , were watching his progress support from afar : @entity23 's tennis racket bag is covered with tweets from his fans @entity20 and @entity12 appeared happy and relaxed as they watched the day 's tennis			1
@entity7 has been a @entity18 fan for years - as have all the @entity165			1
@entity93 has attended the @entity166 and the @entity167 since her big sister 's wedding earlier this year and @entity20 has visited the championships twice before			2
in 2007 she attended with a friend to watch @entity126 play @entity173 @entity172 on court one and in 2008 she visited again			2
a polite thank you letter @entity20 wrote to @entity18 bosses after her most recent visit is currently on display at the @entity180			0
@entity182 spectator : this is @entity20 's third time at @entity18 and her passion for tennis was clear to see from her facial expressions fun day out : @entity12 and @entity20 's visit to @entity188 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties more than 2,000 people queued along the grassy banks outside the club in a bid to secure places for @entity23 's match			1
as the fans waited outside , though , @entity46 and @entity20 took up their prime positions on @entity11			0
there they watched a very convincing display by @entity4 's number one who won the first set in a tie - break , soon claimed the second too and broke early in the third set			2
as well as the young royals , @entity23 had his slightly more personal fan club in attendance			2
his pretty girlfriend @entity157 , and his mother , @entity210 were sitting side - by - side at his fourth round match			1
@entity23 's support also came from further afar , his tennis racket bag was covered with tweets from his legion of fans including ' stay positive we are all behind you ' and ' believe in yourself and never give up			1
' the perfect guest : @entity20 chatted and joked with @entity223 , the wife of the chairman of the @entity225 , who was sitting by her side top tips : @entity20 leant back to give @entity228 , @entity229 's mum , who was sitting behind her , a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too @entity20 and @entity12 's visit to @entity188 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties			2
but they both appeared very contented to chat to the others sitting around them			0
@entity20 looked as composed as we have come to expect from the unflappable duchess			0
she chatted and joked with @entity223 , the wife of the chairman of the @entity225 who was sitting by her side			0
the relaxed tennis fan also leant back to give @entity228 , the mother of our last big @entity4 hopeful , @entity242 , who was sitting behind her , a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too			0
as the @entity31 guests arrived today , thousands of sun drenched fans applauded			0
but the heartiest welcome was reserved for the young couple who were given a standing ovation			0
the retractable roof was also partially covered to shade the royals ' end of the arena			0
other wimbledon - goers were not quite as lucky , they used umbrellas to shade themselves from the sweltering sun as they sat on other courts or watched the action on @entity262			0
sizzling : fans queuing to enter the grounds at @entity18 struggle with the heat , with one man needing to lie down and another woman using an umbrella to shelter from the sun soaking up the rays : with a large bottle of water by her side , this woman lies on the tarmac and covers her forehead outside @entity18 defeat : @entity147 survived three match points			0
but ultimately crashed out against @entity148 in the tournament 's first big upset			2

royal couple were there to watch @entity23 beat @entity26
@entity7 was wearing @entity106 's £ 395 @entity286 dress - which sold out *online* within half an hour of her appearing in it
