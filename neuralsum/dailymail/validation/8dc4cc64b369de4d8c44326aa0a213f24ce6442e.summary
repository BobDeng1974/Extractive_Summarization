the ' crackers ' tv licence can not survive for another decade , @entity0 warned today as he insisted the @entity4 uses it to ' demolish ' its competition			1
the senior conservative said changing viewing habits mean it is harder to justify the ' full whack ' of the levy on every family with a television			1
he admitted that he now never watches tv news , although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on			2
@entity4 director general @entity30 has said he is open to the idea , even though it would mean an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free			0
but mr @entity0 today insisted the idea of funding the full slate of @entity4 output was now in doubt , and the @entity4 ' needs to think about its future '			1
speaking on @entity41 , the @entity0 said : ' many people now no longer get their news , many young people in particular , no longer get their news from tv			1
' they do n't listen to the today programme			0
i do n't watch tv news now , i 'm afraid to say , i get it all on the web			2
so the @entity4 needs to think about its future			0
' he went on : ' i have to say i ca n't see how it can go on forever having a tax on tvs that not everybody uses any more			0
' i can barely make my tv work			0
frankly i come down and i sit at home wait shouting pathetically for some child to come and help me turn it on			0
' the @entity62 select committee suggested the licence fee could continue for another decade , before being reformed in the 2020s			2
but mr @entity0 insisted : ' that seems to me to be too long not to be taking account of the very rapid changes			0
' at the moment every house pays £ 150 in a levy on their television which is crackers			0
this thing needs to be rethought , the licence fee is plainly anachronistic			2
' it needs to be trimmed , it needs to be cut but you are never going to get away from the situation in which people feel the certainty that we are supporting really , really high quality broadcasting in this country			0
' @entity4 director general lord @entity30 has said he believes the licence fee ' has got at least another ten years in it ' he said there would be a case for some money raised from taxpayers to be used to ensure a very high standard of public broadcasting			1
but he said he doubted whether this meant the ' full whack of the licence fee ' was necessary			1
' there is going to have to be a change			0
i think that we are moving in that direction			0
' the basic question is do you need public sector broadcasting			0
should we be putting taxpayers ' money into broadcasting ? the argument would be we put taxpayers ' money into supporting all sorts of arts , and they would die in this country if you did n't have support for the arts			0
' i think you probably do need to support quality broadcasting , proper fantastic productions that the @entity4 specialises in			0
' whether you need to support the whole machine … the @entity4 can be extremely anti-competitive			0
they take huge sums of money from the taxpayer , from the licence payer , and use it to cross-subsidise businesses that demolish local newspapers , local websites			1
' a @entity4 spokesman said : ' we agree with @entity0 on supporting high quality public broadcasting in this country , and that it would be a shame to lose that , which is why it is important that the @entity4 is able to continue offering the high quality news , drama , and entertainment the @entity138 public loves			1
' @entity139 insisted that 96 per cent of people use @entity4 services every week			1
changing viewing habits , including watching online and subscription services , mean the tv licence has become harder to justify @entity4 boss @entity30 yesterday defended the licence fee and said the corporation 's opponents have to be ' honest about the consequences ' of their plans for the organisation			1
in a speech at @entity152 in central @entity19 , he said the corporation was at ' a crossroads ' and the licence fee - which is not currently required to watch catch - up tv on @entity157 - must be amended to cover ' catch - up television as soon as possible '			1
the director general said : ' we 've always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times			2
i welcome the committee 's endorsement of our proposal to require people to pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch - up television			1
the committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee - a universal household levy			1
' both proposals have the same goal in mind : adapting the licence fee for the internet age			2
because i believe we need and we will need what the licence fee - in whatever form - makes happen - more than ever			2
' in fact , i 'm going to go further and argue that if we did n't have a @entity4 funded by a licence fee , such is the world we face , we 'd have to invent it			1
