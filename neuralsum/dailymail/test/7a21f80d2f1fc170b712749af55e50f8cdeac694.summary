first it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep @entity4 's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit @entity8 sunday night series @entity6			1
then came the admission that while @entity4 , 31 , very ' definitely ' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares , he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes			2
in images shot to promote another @entity8 series @entity29 , the actor , who is dating fellow rising @entity33 star @entity41 , appears to have a much thicker chest of hair , suggesting that he 's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath			1
although it seems the @entity8 make - up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full , shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that @entity53 himself might have partaken in			1
it 's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor , so a smattering of hair remains			2
@entity4 's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far , thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes			1
fans have taken to @entity69 to comment on the latest @entity6 male grooming debate			1
one viewer , @ @entity71 , remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug : ' asked to shave his chest hair off ? ! ! i 'd rather he had it all ! ' scythed but not clean shaven ? the brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life still brooding but a more natural image : a bearded @entity4 pictured with his girlfriend @entity41 at the premiere for @entity87 back in 2014 while others have commented that even a smattering is too much			1
user @entity90 said : ' i just ca n't forgive that chest hair			2
i just ca n't ! but it 's @entity95 i could try			0
and some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it			0
@entity100 wrote on the social media site : ' i ca n't think of anything other than running my hands through @entity53 's chest hair			1
' the actor has confessed that he is ' inherently lazy ' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for @entity6 as filming start dates approached			0
' i worked hard for six weeks , killing myself in the gym , watching what i eat and staying away from bad food			0
but i would never , ever do all that if i was n't prepping for a role			0
that 's the only time it just happens , ' he explained			0
' i 'm not like that now			0
i 'm back to my usual soft self			0

photos taken for @entity8 show @entity29 see @entity4 with a full ' rug '
... but his chest hair in @entity6 's *shirtless* scenes looks distinctly pruned
