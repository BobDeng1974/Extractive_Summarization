a desperate attempt to stop @entity2 's precious ' water pandas ' dying out forever has begun on the @entity3			2
the @entity3 finless porpoise is facing the same fate as their cousin , the river dolphins which were officially declared extinct in 2006 , wiped out by human development in the world 's most populous country			1
there are just 1,000 of the fresh water mammals left living in the world 's longest river , but number are declining by more than 13 per cent every year , the @entity12 reports			2
at that rate , the finless porpoises - who are known for their mischievous smiles , and referred to affectionately as @entity2 's pandas of the water - will be extinct within a decade			1
endangered : the @entity3 finless porpoise is critically endangered and could be extinct within the decade mission : fishermen and experts have known joined together to try to halt the decline but now local fishermen have joined forces with the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) and @entity2 's @entity32 to try and turn the tide for the porpoises , after the @entity35 and the @entity36 decided it was time to save the species			1
the @entity39 officially began this month when a fleet of carefully navigated boats headed out into @entity42 in @entity43			0
the lake is almost twice the size of @entity46 and hit the headlines last year after it dried up , thanks to the @entity49 - the world 's biggest dam - and a drought			0
but the freshwater lake , the largest in @entity2 , is also home to almost half the surviving finless porpoises - a total of 450 animals			2
the project aimed to catch the @entity3 's last remaining water mammals , attracting them using sonar to allow them to collect data on their health , gender , weight and measurements			0
the strongest animals were then taken to be released into other areas , where scientists hope they will help increase the populations			0
plan : a new project sees some of the strongest animals from the largest population being relocated future : experts hope the animals they catch in @entity42 will help increase populations elsewhere @entity31 's porpoise project protection commissioner @entity77 said they had managed to catch 36 finless porpoises since march 11			1
' after physical examinations we have temporarily placed 11 of them into holding cages and eight of these will be relocated to their new homes in april , ' he added it is thought the porpoises will be moved to waters in two conservation areas on the border of @entity92 and @entity93 provinces .			0

@entity3 finless porpoises are *classified* as ' critically endangered ' by @entity31
only surviving mammals in the @entity3 since river dolphins made extinct
just 1,000 finless porpoises remain - and could be extinct with ten years
@entity31 and @entity32 now *launched* program to save species
*organisations* , with the help of local fishermen , hope to reverse decline
