by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 13:14 est , 6 august 2013 a set of identical twins who happen to both be @entity4 astronauts will soon become subjects of a @entity7 experiment about the genetic - level effects of living in space			1
@entity10 and @entity11 are genetically indiscernible from one another and researchers hope to use that biological fluke to their advantage by comparing the brothers ’ bodies when one goes to space while the other stays behind on @entity20			1
the study is the first of its kind and will take place as @entity11 becomes the first @entity4 to spend an entire year living in space			1
cosmic twins : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity27 are identical twins and will soon become the focus of @entity7 research into possible genetic - level effects of extended stays in space ‘ it ’s not the kind of research that we in the human research program normally like to do , ’ chief scientist @entity33 told @entity34			1
‘ [ but ] there may well be insights that can be gained that have not been investigated yet			0
’ @entity7 ’s @entity43 has previously investigated the interacts between and intersections of human physiology , technology , and the space environment , but research into possible effects of living in space at the genetic level is a new undertaking			0
researchers are n’t altogether sure what they ’ll learn from the experiment , but say it could yield breakthroughs simply by virtue of its newness			0
‘ the way we wrote the proposal is essentially anything that researchers think is relevant to understanding the genomics , ’ said @entity33 , ‘ that can be deduced from a study of one astronaut in flight and one astronaut who is retired and not flying and living the good life in @entity73			2
’ unprecedented : the brothers ' unique situation makes them perfect subjects for such research as both @entity11 and @entity10 will be tested throughout @entity11 's year - long stint on the @entity79 in 2015 in 2015 , @entity11 will begin his unprecedented stay aboard the @entity79 alongside @entity82 cosmonaut @entity81			1
@entity11 will be the first @entity4 to spend a year in space , while five @entity82 have done so previously			1
meanwhile , @entity27 will remain firmly planted on @entity20			1
the retired brother served as pilot or commander of multiple @entity88 space shuttle missions and may be even better known as husband to former congresswoman @entity90 , who survived an assassination attempt in @entity92 , @entity93 in 2011			1
both brothers will submit blood and tissues to researchers for the year - long experiment			2
@entity11 ’s sample will serve to determine what , if any , genetic changes occur during extended stays outside @entity20			1
new territory : physiological impacts of space travel like those pictured have long been a focus of @entity7 's @entity108 , but genetic changes have not been studied @entity10 ’s will serve as the control samples			2
' this is sort of our first foray into the genetic aspects of spaceflight			0
this really is the wave of the future , ' said @entity33			0
@entity11 was among four astronauts on @entity7 's short list for the assignment			2
each had served as a commander aboard the space station , and was able to perform spacewalks and robot arm operations			0
medical information also went into the selection : a crew member could not have exceeded his limit for exposure to cosmic radiation , for instance			0
@entity11 said he has no idea how or why he ended up being chosen			0
he will set a @entity4 space endurance record with this mission			1
no @entity4 has spent more than seven months in space at a time			2
cosmic radiation exposure and the possible increase of the likelihood of certain cancers is one known physiological danger of prolonged space flights			0
the deterioration of weight - bearing bones and certain muscle groups is another effect commonly associated with astronauts and space travel			0
researchers hope this new type of experiment will help us better understand space travel ’s less obvious effects so that they can prepare for the in the future .			0

@entity11 will become the first @entity4 to spend a year in outer space in 2015
retired astronaut and husband to @entity90 , @entity27 , will remain on @entity20 as scientists compare their blood and tissue samples
