if @entity2 's early @entity1 exit was not hard enough to stomach then look away now because the @entity5 media has found rich entertainment in poking fun at @entity9 's beleaguered men			1
after the calamitous 5 - 0 ashes whitewash last winter , @entity5 scribes could hardly have expected that just 12 months later they would be handed even more ammunition to shoot down the mother country			0
the 15 - run defeat to @entity15 that sealed @entity2 's fate in @entity17 was their fourth defeat in five games at a forgettable @entity1 and means they will fly home after their now meaningless final group game against @entity22 on friday			2
the @entity5 newspapers pulled no punches as they mercilessly mocked @entity2 's exit @entity26 and his side came in for plenty of stick from the @entity5 press after defeat to @entity15 @entity32 could be out of a job after watching his team crash out of the @entity1 with four defeats from five @entity36 looks down at his bat as he joins the procession of @entity40 batsmen who failed to make a score @entity42 is a doubt for @entity2 's final game of the @entity1 after picking up a side injury @entity46 arrives at @entity47 after @entity2 's shocking defeat to @entity15 on monday ' cheerio chaps : poms are bangers and mashed ' was the back - page headline that greeted the @entity2 squad when they landed in @entity47 on tuesday			1
if coach @entity26 and his team dared pick up a copy of the @entity57 they were certainly reminded , in no uncertain terms , how well an @entity40 failure is regarded in the @entity61			2
' @entity2 have been utterly embarrassing , ' the story opined before throwing thoughts ahead to this summer 's ashes , adding : ' @entity5 fans now ca n't wait to face cricket 's minnows - that 's @entity2 - in the @entity64			1
' back at the scene of @entity2 's exit the @entity68 focused on the prospect of @entity26 being replaced by @entity73 coach @entity72 , who grew up in the @entity5 capital			1
' the look on ashen - faced @entity32 as cameras panned in encapsulated a dead man sitting , ' @entity75 wrote			0
@entity2 captain @entity9 has come in for criticism as his side crashed out of the @entity1 fast bowlers @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) have been far from their best all tournament @entity85 arrives at @entity47 on tuesday ahead of their final @entity1 game @entity87 looks a beaten man during @entity2 's dismal display , which left them as a laughing stock @entity92 dives but was run out as @entity2 's hopes , and batting order , disintegrated in @entity17 @entity15 celebrated at the end , but the @entity5 press dubbed @entity2 the new ' minnows ' of cricket ' @entity2 's demise will now have @entity73 and incoming @entity101 chairman @entity100 sending an sos to 71 - @entity103 paceman @entity72			1
' @entity2 's ' catalogue of @entity17 disasters ' was also broken down since the unlikely last - day @entity103 defeat in 2006 when it was suggested then captain @entity104 had been ' turned to drink to soothe the pain '			0
@entity2 's poor record at @entity110 was also underlined in the brevity of one statistic which read : ' while the @entity113 has faded so has its cricket machine , winning just five matches against top - eight ranked rivals in @entity110 since 1996			2
' @entity26 ' own apparent liking for statistic was not missed , and his post-match claim that he would need to ' look at the data ' raised a @entity122 smirk or two with one internet headline reading : ' analyse this data ; one win , four losses ' before offering a link to ' @entity2 's worst cricket disasters '			1
the anguish is clear to see on @entity36 's face as he is dismissed , and @entity2 exited at the first stage @entity26 ' ' grey hair seeming to whiten at each wicket ' according to one @entity5 journalist the @entity122 media suggested that former fast - bowler @entity72 could be drafted in to replace @entity26 @entity72 took 259 wickets in 71 tests for @entity138 , and is now coaching yorkshire in the @entity5 one of the country 's pre-eminent cricket writer 's @entity141 was more nuance , but no less scathing , as he wrote of the fear that was visible on the @entity2 players ' faces whenever the television cameras panned to them waiting in the dugout to bat			1
' they were as cheerful as boys awaiting the cuts from their headmaster			0
at the centre of it all , @entity26 , grey hair seeming to whiten at each wicket			0
' and at the last , a tiny glimpse of @entity46 , seated next to his coach as @entity82 fell , blowing a little bubble of gum			0
pop - that was all it took			0
' @entity141 finished by adding : ' @entity26 wanted people to wait to judge him until after the @entity1 ended			2
they 're ready , coach			0
