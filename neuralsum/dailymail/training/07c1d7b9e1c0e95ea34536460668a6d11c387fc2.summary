by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 16:46 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 17:55 est , 14 october 2013 @entity4 @entity3 @entity2 has been a member of @entity5 since 1981 and a senator since 1997 , but he 's never run this hard to the right before			1
on friday he demanded the resignation of @entity10 secretary @entity9 , and his newly minted @entity12 challenger thinks he knows why			1
@entity13 , a fire - breathing conservative radiologist who 's also a second - cousin to @entity14 , announced on tuesday that he would run against @entity2 in 2014 for the @entity3 nomination			1
three days later , @entity2 released a video message saying @entity9 ' wo n’t shoot straight with the @entity1 people ' in the face of ' systematic , profound and indisputable ' problems with the online rollout of the @entity22 health insurance exchanges			1
' if you think those two developments are n’t connected , ' a @entity24 columnist wrote , ' then you probably think the @entity26 are headed for the national championship this year – in football			0
' of course @entity9 should resign , ' he said , ' but we would n't be in this mess today if it was n't for senator @entity2 himself			1
' @entity2 , he explained , ' provided the critical support @entity14 needed to place @entity9 in charge of @entity22			1
... [ he ] publicly endorsed @entity9 and voted for her – twice			2
' @entity2 was one of just two @entity3 senators who voted twice to confirm @entity9 after the president nominated her in 2009 – both in committee and in a final floor vote			1
( the other was @entity54 sen. @entity53			0
) but now @entity2 is singing a different tune			2
' in the absence of a full repeal of @entity22 , which is my preference , we need new leadership from top to bottom , ' @entity2 declared			1
' i am calling on the secretary to resign			0
' @entity2 is n't alone : @entity65 , the communications guru who briefed reporters during much of president @entity14 's first term , said on monday that heads should roll over @entity22 -- but stopped short of naming names @entity13 has made a name for himself with a series of web videos in which he lambastes his more famous second - cousin for being a ' socialist ' bent on turning @entity1 ' into a second - rate welfare state ' @entity2 has targeted parts of the @entity76 , including a vote in march to support a defunding effort spearheaded by @entity80 sen. @entity79			1
he voted against the law itself , and also introduced unsuccessful legislation in june that would have repealed the @entity22 insurance exchanges if they were n't ready for enrollment by october 1			2
@entity13 , a @entity4 radiologist , could give @entity2 a run for his money -- or the @entity12 pressure could make @entity2 move further to the right in a state where conservatism wins elections since that date , a federal government website operating 36 of the exchanges has been plagued by problems			1
millions of taxpayers have n't been able to sign up because of poor technology planning			0
two @entity10 data crunchers told @entity38 that during its first week of operation , just 51,000 people successfully enrolled			0
@entity65 , the @entity14 @entity102 's first press secretary , threw gasoline on the fire monday , telling @entity106 viewers that heads should roll			2
he did n't specify who should get the guillotine treatment , however			0
' when they get it fixed , i hope they fire some people who were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work , ' @entity65 said			0
' this is excruciatingly embarrassing for the @entity102 ​ and the @entity10			0
' @entity2 ' office did n't respond to a question about whether his sudden turn against @entity9 was driven by politics			1
but @entity13 said in a statement that when @entity2 voted to confirm @entity9 in 2009 , he ' joined with the @entity124 insiders and other career politicians and decided to give her even more power that she used to ram through and then oversee the most disastrous government program in our lifetimes			1
' ' we need more senators like @entity79 , @entity132 , and @entity133 , ' he added later , , bolstering his tea party street - cred			1
@entity136 columnist @entity136 wrote on friday that @entity2 ' was n't always so hard right			2
he was seen as more pragmatic in the ’ 80s and ’ 90s and once savaged the @entity4 @entity80 ’s rightward plunge in the late 1990s as akin to a death march			0
' ' @entity2 these days is die - hard conservative , ' he noted			1
' in @entity4 , that ’s the only safe place to be			0
' @entity2 ( c ) chaired the @entity140 until @entity3 lost their majority in 2007			2
he also serves on the @entity142 committees the senator 's campaign manager told @entity146 last week that ' it will be pretty hard for anyone to get on the conservative side of @entity2			2
' @entity2 told @entity150 in september that he was indifferent to a primary challenge from @entity13 , claiming he is ' not vulnerable ' and ' in a very strong position			0
' ' obviously the water is fine : anybody can enter a primary – for that matter , an election , ' he said			0
@entity13 , 42 , thinks he 's up to the challenge , even while he acknowledges that he will likely need to raise $ 4 million by next year to mount a credible challenge to the 77 - year - old senator			0
' if you think that the career politicians in both parties have failed @entity1 , join us , ' he says on his campaign website			0
' we are building the @entity167 to defeat the @entity168			0

sen. @entity2 demanded top @entity22 boss ' head just days after a tea party challenger announced his run for the senate seat
@entity177 is a second - cousin to @entity14
@entity2 has *opposed* @entity22 before but was never as *strident* about it until he faced re-election pressure
the senator was one of just two *republicans* to vote in favor of *hhs* secretary @entity9 ' confirmation in 2009
