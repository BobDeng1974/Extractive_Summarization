having to find a suitable place in which to land and refuel your f - 16 fighter jet can take a lot of time			1
but this video released by @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity5 shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles			1
captured on camera is the moment the @entity14 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy @entity5			1
the f - 16 fighter jet skilfully flies up behind the main aircraft and steadies itself while getting into position a large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet			1
the jet moves into position , allowing the nozzle to enter a small triangular hole at the top of the @entity14			2
the two planes maintain their speed as the snowy @entity5 landscape flashes by below them , and the fuel transfers from one to the other			0
receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight , the fighter jet pulls away from the larger plane and flies off			2
the large nozzle hanging from the bottom of the plane manoeuvres towards the fighter jet and it latches on the process is then repeated with another plane moments later			1
@entity44 and @entity7 are the home of @entity45 , who execute tactical air combat employment exercises			0
the exercises are designed to help pilots gain more experience by having them deal with the stresses war fighters go through while flying , but in controlled conditions			0
the two planes maintain their speed while flying over @entity5 as fuel is transferred from one to the other after receiving enough fuel to carry on its flight , the fighter jet pulls away from the larger aircraft the crews are subjected to a number of conceivable combat threats , and up to 70 jet fighters can be operating in the same airspace at one time			0
on average , however , more than 1,000 @entity65 members and up to 60 aircraft deploy to @entity44 , and an additional 500 people and 40 aircraft deploy to @entity7 for each event			2
the exercises also provide an operations training environment for participants such as unit - level intelligence experts , maintenance crews , and command and control elements			0
refuelling in the air is an example of a tactical exercise pilots are required to demonstrate .			0

it *connects* with a nozzle that extends from the tanker aircraft and refuels
