in reality , @entity0 has six games to save @entity4 's season and his own proud record of never having been relegated			1
for you can as good as write off the last two matches of this desperate campaign , trips to @entity10 and @entity11			0
@entity4 have not won away in 2015 and there is no evidence to suggest they will start to do so at the home of top - four opponents			1
@entity4 interim manager @entity0 has said his side will play ' ugly ' football if they need to @entity20 's @entity4 debut was marred by a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity22 thanks to @entity24 's late goal @entity22 striker @entity25 ( left ) jumps for the ball alongside @entity4 defender @entity27 ( right ) @entity0 set out with beautiful intent at @entity22 , naming three strikers having 24 hours earlier rubbished mention of his defensive reputation — but things have very quickly got ugly			1
' the only important thing in the final games is winning , ' said the 67 - year - old , whose @entity37 debut ended in defeat when @entity24 struck two minutes from time			1
' the way we do that is not important			0
so if we win games very ugly i like that			1
we will play very negative if the need is there			2
' @entity0 has given his players the early part of the week off , an agreed rest period which is the legacy of @entity51 's ill - fated reign			1
the @entity52 joked that the club do n't have too many international players so their preparations for the visit of @entity59 rivals @entity55 a week on sunday will not be disrupted			0
that , you feel , is a match @entity4 must now win			1
by a quirk of footballing fate , previous bosses @entity63 and @entity51 both enjoyed derby victories in their second match in charge			0
@entity4 winger @entity70 prepares to strike the ball after coming on as a substitute on saturday for @entity0 , it is arguably his most winnable game of the eight remaining			1
defeat is not an option			2
' being at home in derbies gives a big advantage , ' he added			0
' i know the intensity of these games — i was involved many times in @entity84 against @entity85			2
' i made the mistake of perhaps not realising that at first and i lost 5 - 1			2
' but @entity55 for us now is the most important thing			0
we have a good period to practise and i think the ( international ) break is a good thing			0
i have time now to see what my best line - up will be			2
' @entity22 boss @entity95 , meanwhile , has been linked with the @entity4 post at the end of the season			1
he , however , wants a new deal at @entity100 after seeing his side climb to ninth			0
' i do n't know why people have speculated about me and @entity4 , ' he said			2
' i 'm doing what i did here in my second year , my contract was running out then			0
' at the end of the season we will look at the squad			0
we have to get more players in to build the club and make sure we sustain the growth we are achieving at this point in time			0
' @entity22 boss @entity95 has dismissed speculation linking him to the @entity4 job			1

@entity4 boss @entity0 faces a *challenge* to keep them up this season
