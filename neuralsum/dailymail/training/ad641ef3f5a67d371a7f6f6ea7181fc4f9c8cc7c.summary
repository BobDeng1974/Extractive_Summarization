by @entity1 reporter published : 19:36 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 19:36 est , 16 october 2013 children who spend time in day care centres or with childminders are more likely to have behavioural issues such as hyperactivity , researchers have found			1
youngsters who were cared for away from their parents also had a higher chance of ‘ peer problems ’ , said @entity13 experts			2
the strongest and most consistent influences on behaviour came from the home environment and the level of care given by mothers , they claimed			1
children who are cared for away from their parents had a higher chance of ' peer problems ' , the study found researchers set out to examine how different types of care influence child behaviour following the ‘ dramatic increase ’ in working mothers in recent decades			1
‘ spending more time in day care centres , over the total period was a predictor of total problem scores , ’ said professor @entity29 , of the university ’s @entity30			1
however , children who spent more time in pre-school playgroups had fewer problems with their peers			2
and more time with a nanny produced better ‘ prosocial behaviour ’ – showing willingness to help others			0
the study authors , writing in the journal child : @entity47 , said : ‘ children who spent more time in day care centres were more likely to be hyperactive			1
‘ children receiving more care by childminders were more likely to have peer problems			0
‘ the findings in relation to childminding suggest that it might be out of home care rather than group care that raises the risk of behavioural difficulties			0
’ they concluded : ‘ these findings suggest that interventions to enhance children ’s emotional and behavioural development might best focus on supporting families and augmenting the quality of care in the home			2
’ researchers found the strongest and most consistent influences on behaviour came from mothers the authors said the 2010 @entity77 report on health inequalities had highlighted the importance of children ’s early experiences in influencing their later emotional and behavioural development			1
their study looked at 991 families recruited when the children were three months old			0
all the mothers were over 16 at birth with an average age of 30			0
assessments were made around 51 months , when the children were at school entry age , through questionnaires about their behaviour and emotions completed by both teachers and parents			2
researchers also carried out direct observations of caregiving provided by mothers and observed non-parental care for at least 90 minutes for children placed in other forms of care			0
the total number of hours in some kind of care away from the child ’s mother was not related to the overall levels of problems , whether rated by mothers or teachers			0
however , it remained the case that children who received more group care in day care centres had more behavioural difficulties , according to both their mothers and teachers			1
teacher assessments showed children who spent more time in day care centres had ' more total problems and more conduct problems			1
' children spending more time with childminders were also rated as having higher levels of total problems			0
' the findings in relation to childminding suggest that it might be out of home care rather than group care that raises the risk of behavioural difficulties , ' the authors said .			0
