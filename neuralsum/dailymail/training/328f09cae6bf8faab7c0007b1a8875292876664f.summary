by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter concerns : evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced @entity7 to death the @entity9 says the @entity10 has denied its petition to posthumously pardon a @entity13 man executed for killing his three children in a house fire			1
a letter from the parole board released last week says the agency has denied a pardon for @entity7 , whose case has been cited by wrongful - conviction advocates who argue @entity13 ' death - penalty system is severely flawed			1
@entity7 was put to death in 2004 for the deaths of his three daughters in a house fire in @entity28			1
fire investigation experts say the science used to convict @entity7 was faulty			2
the @entity31 - based @entity9 , which has argued @entity7 's case after his death , says the parole board 's decision ' illustrates that the clemency system is completely broken in @entity13			1
' @entity7 was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis that was later discredited , and testimony from a jailhouse informant			1
however , a note found in the case files suggested that the prosecutor may have concealed a deal with the informant , @entity46 , who claimed @entity7 had confessed to him			1
before @entity7 was executed in 2004 , a prosecutor argued that @entity46 's testimony was enough to prove his guilt , after the arson analysis was found to be substandard			1
last month , however , lawyers seeking a posthumous pardon for @entity7 claimed the inmate who provided testimony did so to gain a reduced sentence , the @entity55 reported			1
widespread support : the annual ' march to abolish the @entity58 ' at the @entity59 in @entity60 in 2009 used @entity7 's likeness belief in innocence : attorney @entity63 ( right ) speaks to reporters after announcing the filing of a petition for posthumous pardon for @entity7 , in @entity60 , @entity13 , on october 24 , 2012 if that had proven to be the case in the lead up to @entity7 's execution , it could have been enough to clear him of guilt			2
' it 's astonishing that 10 years after @entity7 was executed we are still uncovering evidence showing what a grave injustice this case represents , ' @entity75 , co-director of the @entity9 , which is working on the case , said			1
@entity7 's case has been scrutinized by advocates who argue the state may have executed a wrongfully convicted man			2
fire science experts already have refuted much of the methodology used in his case			0
@entity46 and the trial prosecutor , @entity92 , have both denied any deal existed during @entity46 's testimony			2
doubt : new evidence suggests @entity7 , pictured here with one of his daughters , may have been wrongfully convicted crime scene : @entity7 was accused of killing his three children in a fire at this house in 1991 lawyers from @entity31 - based @entity9 filed an official request to have @entity7 exonerated because of the discredited arson analysis and efforts to cut @entity46 's sentence			1
in november , one of the project 's lawyers , @entity112 , was going through files when he found a box of photocopies , which included a handwritten note on the inside of the district attorney 's folder			0
the note , which is not dated or signed , allegedly stated that @entity46 's charges were to be listed as a lighter robbery charge ' based on coop in @entity7 '			2
mr @entity112 described the discovery to the @entity55 as a ' rush of excitement ' , adding : ' this is what we 've been looking for			0
' mr @entity75 said the case has suggested a weakness in the justice system			0
if @entity135 € ™ s testimony ' was really based on a deal and misrepresentation , then the system can not be regulated ... you can not prevent the execution of an innocent person [ in those circumstances ]			0
' justice : @entity7 's cousin , @entity143 , holds up a photo of him playing with one of his children at a press conference in 2006 @entity92 , the prosecutor who later became a state district judge , has maintained that @entity46 did not receive leniency			0
he told the @entity0 on friday that he had not seen the note , but believed it was likely referring to efforts he made to get @entity153 out of prison after @entity7 's trial due to threats to @entity46 's safety			2
' the file may certainly reflect that we tried to get sentencing shortened , but it had nothing to do with any agreement relative to the @entity7 trial , ' @entity92 said			0
he said imprisoned members of the @entity164 had threatened @entity46 due to his role in @entity7 's conviction			0
' we certainly had an interest in not seeing a primary witness in the case killed while he was in prison , ' he said			0
@entity7 's family said if he was pardoned they would not press for damages			0
his cousin , @entity174 , added : ' we 're not asking for compensation , we 're asking for justice			0

@entity7 was executed in @entity13 in 2004 for the deaths of his three daughters in a house fire
the @entity9 petitioned the @entity10 to posthumously pardon him
the *appeal* has been denied
a note discovered in case files suggested inmate who claimed @entity7 had confessed was given a reduced sentence for testimony
testimony was key evidence after arson analysis was discredited
the parole board 's decision ' illustrates that the clemency system is completely broken in @entity13 , ' according to the @entity9
