the business secretary will unveil details of @entity13 plans to sponsor a new bank which is to offer credit through smaller providers such as @entity17 , the co-op and the @entity19			2
mr @entity3 has scored a significant victory over chancellor @entity21 in securing new public money for the institution			0
the @entity13 had initially intended simply to put existing government lending initiatives under one roof and call it a business bank			1
both mr @entity3 ’s business department and the @entity13 will contribute to the £ 1billion public money put into the project , potentially meaning more spending cuts			2
the private sector is expected to contribute at least as much again , allowing the bank to underwrite around £ 10billion of lending to small businesses			1
however , despite the urgency of the squeeze on firms , the new bank is not expected to be up and running for 12 to 18 months			0
mr @entity3 admits many firms still face serious problems in raising finance , with 33 per cent which applied for a loan in the last year being turned down			0
the creation of the state - backed business bank is a tacit admission that @entity47 , the government ’s attempt to set tough new lending targets for the big four banks – @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 – has done little to help			2
business groups have been calling for a single institution , backed by the state , to address the gaps in the supply of finance for several years			2
the proposal is inspired by similar models in @entity64 , the @entity65 and @entity66			1
the business secretary will say : ‘ for decades @entity69 industry has lacked the sort of diverse , long - term finance that is normal elsewhere			0
we need a @entity69 business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending rapidly and we are now going to get it			2
‘ alongside the private sector , the bank will get the market lending to manufacturers , exporters and growth companies that so desperately need support			0
it will be a lasting monument to our determination to reshape finance so it can finally serve industry the way it should			0
‘ its success will not be the scale of its own direct interventions but how far it shakes up the market in business finance and helps to ease constraints for high - growth firms			0
’ not lending : the creation of the state - backed business bank is a tacit admission that @entity47 , the @entity99 s attempt to set tough new lending targets for the big four banks ¿ @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity102 has done little to help mr @entity3 will tell the @entity104 conference that the bank will support up to £ 10billion of finance to small and medium businesses – a significant portion of all the lending available			1
the bank , he will say , will operate at arm ’s length from @entity49 and be commercially focused			0
@entity112 , director general of the @entity113 , said : ‘ we are pleased that ministers are heeding our call to create a business bank that goes well beyond a re-badging of existing schemes			1
‘ the funding announced by @entity3 is the first step in a journey toward a @entity123 that enables new and growing companies to get access to capital in the same way that they do in @entity64 , @entity129 , and the @entity65			1
’ @entity130 , national chairman of the @entity131 , said : ‘ the small business bank is a good thing – we ’ve been calling for this for a long time and we are delighted to see it finally get off the ground			1
‘ we are certain it will help boost confidence and deliver growth			0
’ business lobby : @entity130 , national chairman of the @entity131 , left , and @entity112 , director general of the @entity113 , right , both back the move the @entity144 has highlighted the plight of struggling small firms with its ‘ make the @entity148 ’ campaign for several years			1
the small business loan market currently has around £ 50billion of outstanding loans , and the typical amount of capital set aside by a large high street bank for supporting this area of the economy is at most a few billion pounds			1
mr @entity3 warned @entity157 colleagues last night that regional public sector pay – an idea being examined by chancellor @entity21 – was ‘ completely unacceptable ’ and ‘ terrible economics ’			0
he said , however , that the @entity104 were prepared to contemplate a degree of flexibility in different parts of the country to aid recruitment .			0

new bank will underwrite around £ 10billion of lending to small businesses
proposal is similar to models in @entity64 , @entity66 and the @entity65
