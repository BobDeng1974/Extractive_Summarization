he said it was alleged i was in a room with @entity6 , and these two alleged 14 - year - old girls			1
‘ i ’ve only met @entity6 maybe twice			1
he came to see me with his mother at one of my shows			2

‘ he said to me : “ now then young man , i ’ve brought the duchess to meet you ” - that was his mother			1
they stayed for 15 or 20 minutes before he left me so i had time to plan what i was going to do in the show			2
