it is a far cry from 2011 , when his company , @entity6 , made a paltry £ 547			1
this then grew to £ 409,728 the following year – before his affair with @entity17 , his 36 - year - old co-star on his @entity9 television series , threatened to ruin it all			1
his show , the @entity35 , was dropped while his marriage to his wife @entity37 appeared to be hanging in the balance			1
since then , however , @entity39 has succeeded in turning his life around			1
after reconciling with @entity41 , 50 , at the end of last year , he has concentrated on making the most of his media profile			0
