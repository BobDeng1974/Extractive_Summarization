they were introduced to the @entity1 when she toured the @entity81 area of the @entity55			2

warm welcome : the @entity1 smiles as she meets hundreds of people gathered at @entity3 's @entity55 @entity87 : the @entity1 and prince @entity14 climbed aboard a boat for a tour along the @entity12 to see the areas hit by january 's flooding because the animals were bred in captivity , they are accustomed to being around people and are often brought out to meet vip guests			1
the @entity1 asked about the flooding and if it affected the animals , and was told by ms @entity84 : ' they had to be evacuated to higher ground behind their home , @entity104 was inundated ( with water )			2

' the @entity1 recycled an outfit from her wardrobe yesterday when she stepped out into the sunshine in the primrose yellow dress she wore to the wedding of the @entity14 and @entity197			1

or perhaps to keep costs down			0
