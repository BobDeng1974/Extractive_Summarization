a hazardous drug that eliminates free will and can wipe the memory of its victims is currently being dealt on the streets of @entity5			1
the drug is called scopolamine , but is colloquially known as ‘ @entity8 , ' and is derived from a particular type of tree common to @entity11			1
stories surrounding the drug are the stuff of urban legends , with some telling horror stories of how people were raped , forced to empty their bank accounts , and even coerced into giving up an organ			1
in two segments , he revealed the shocking culture of another @entity5 drug world , interviewing those who deal the drug and those who have fallen victim to it			1
@entity42 , a drug dealer in the capital of @entity44 , said the drug is frightening for the simplicity in which it can be administered			2
he told @entity31 that @entity26 can be blown in the face of a passer - by on the street , and within minutes , that person is under the drug ’s effect - scopolamine is odourless and tasteless			1
‘ you can guide them wherever you want , ’ he explained			0
‘ it ’s like they ’re a child			0
’ @entity42 said that one gram of @entity26 is similar to a gram of cocaine , but later called it ‘ worse than anthrax			0
’ in high doses , it is lethal			0
it only takes a moment : one drug dealer in @entity44 explained how victims are drugged within minutes of exposure victims : one @entity5 woman said that under the influence of scopolamine , she led a man to her house and helped him ransack it the drug , he said , turns people into complete zombies and blocks memories from forming			1
so even after the drug wears off , victims have no recollection as to what happened			2
one victim told @entity31 that a man approached her on the street asking her for directions			0
since it was close by , she helped take the man to his destination , and they drank juice together			0
' you can guide them wherever you want			0
it ’s like they ’re a child			0
' she took the man to her house and helped him gather all of her belongings , including her boyfriend ’s cameras and savings			2
‘ it is painful to have lost money , ’ the woman said , ’ but i was actually quite lucky			0
’ according to the @entity109 , the drug - also known as hyoscine - causes the same level of memory loss as diazepam			2
in ancient times , the drug was given to the mistresses of dead @entity5 leaders – they were told to enter their master ’s grave , where they were buried alive			1
@entity124 's breath : the drug is odourless and tasteless and can simply be blown in the face of someone on the street ; their free will vanishes after being exposed to it dangerous : @entity31 's @entity30 traveled to the capital of @entity44 to find out more about the drug in modern times , the @entity134 used the drug as part of @entity139 interrogations , with the hope of using it like a truth serum			1
however , because of the drug ’s chemical makeup , it also induces powerful hallucinations			0
the tree common around @entity5 , and is called the ‘ borrachero ’ tree – loosely translated as the ' get - you - drunk ' tree			1
it is said that @entity5 mothers warn their children not to fall asleep under the tree , though the leafy green canopies and large yellow and white flowers seem appealing			2
experts are baffled as to why @entity5 is riddled with scopolamine - related crimes , but wager much of it has to do with the country ’s torn drug - culture past , and on - going civil war			1
