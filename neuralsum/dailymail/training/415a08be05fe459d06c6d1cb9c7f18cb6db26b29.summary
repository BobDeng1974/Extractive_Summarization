an artist was forced to have 25 stitches in each of her eyes after they both burst - with one splitting during a driving lesson			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , was driving along a dual carriageway with her driving instructor when she began to suffer pain and having problems with her sight			1
after being took back home , miss @entity6 was then rushed to hospital where consultants discovered that her cornea had split and diagnosed her with @entity18 , a degenerative eye disorder			1
@entity6 , who was diagnosed with @entity18 , a degenerative eye condition , after one of her eyeballs burst during a driving lesson the 30 - year - old explained : ' it was painful , but i just thought i had something in my eye			1
' we were on the @entity29 dual carriageway at the time , so the instructor told me to get off at the next slip road			1
he took over the pedals and i kept steering as well as i could			0
' the hospital patched me up and told me how to keep it clean			0
' miss @entity6 then had surgery on her left eye and was still recovering from the first operation when her right eye then burst five months later			1
after having surgery on her left eye , five months later her right eyeball also split , meaning she had to have 25 stitches in each eye she recalled : ' the second time i was watching a film			1
' the consultants were stunned - it was the most severe case they had ever seen			0
' she has since had cornea transplants in both eyes and was given 25 stitches in each eyeball during operations that each lasted for three and a half hours at @entity55			1
the artist added : ' fortunately i was under general anaesthetic , otherwise i think i would have had a panic attack			0
' it was quite an embroidery project for them			0
' most of the stitches have been removed but she now has four stitches in each eye , which may be left in place permanently			2
her condition is genetic and her mother and brother are both affected and they believe her great - grandfather , who used to wear an eye patch , also suffered from it			2
experts believe the degenerative disorder , which causes the front of the eyeball to thin and bend out of shape , affects between one in 500 and one in 2,000 people , but difficulties with diagnosis make it hard to give an accurate estimate			2
the condition can cause distorted vision , including multiple images and streaking , as well as sensitivity to light , and is usually diagnosed in teenagers			2
miss @entity6 explained : ' i knew it could run in the family , so i was always aware of it , but i never realised my eye could actually burst			1
most of the stitches have now been removed and the 30 - year - old now has four stitches in each eye , which may be left in place permanently			2
she is pictured after having surgery on her left eye miss @entity6 has now had to re-learn her art techniques and adapt her style of painting after her vision was affected by her condition ' my mum @entity104 suffered with the condition for 25 years , whereas for me , it happened out of the blue			1
' as a professional artist , the 30 - year - old depends on her eyesight to earn a living and has had to adapt her style of work			0
she mostly works in oils and paints in the traditional @entity116 style , which involves huge attention to detail			0
' i am not able to see as well as i could and to some extent , i have had to re-learn my techniques and adapt my style ' , she explained ' i would not trust myself with portraits anymore because of the finer features of the faces			0
' she now focuses on landscapes and has recently opened the @entity127 , in @entity128 , north @entity8 , with her friend @entity129 , who specialises in jewellery			0
@entity18 is a condition which causes the cornea in the eye to progressively thin , meaning a cone - shaped bulge develops			1
it is a genetic disorder and is more common in people with asthma and @entity138			0
the thinning and the change in shape of the cornea means the eye is often unable to focus and can therefore impair a person 's vision			2
if it is diagnosed early , treatment can include wearing glasses or contact lenses to correct vision			0
in more severe cases , a cornea transplant may be needed			0
