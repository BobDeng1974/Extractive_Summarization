no police officers will be disciplined despite failing to properly investigate the systematic rape and abuse of young girls in @entity5 , it was revealed today			1
seven @entity7 officers were served with misconduct notices but after a four year investigation six were given ' management advice ' and one was allowed to retire			1
the @entity5 scandal saw hundreds of vulnerable young girls fall into the hands of @entity16 grooming gangs because the authorities failed to protect them over at least six years			1
in 2012 nine @entity16 men were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 , plying them with drugs , alcohol and money before passing them round the group for sex			1
no further action : seven police officers who were served with misconduct notices over the abuse scandal in @entity5 ( pictured ) , will not face disciplinary action a subsequent report said the girls were allowed to fall into the hands of @entity37 grooming gangs because police and social workers may have been scared of seeming racist			1
it sparked an investigation conducted by the force 's professional standards branch , and supervised by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , which today highlights a number of significant failures			0
its report , published today , concludes that the officers placed too much emphasis on the credibility of the victims , and not enough on the crime			1
the seven officers investigated were interviewed about their decision - making , handling of investigations , and victim care			1
they were the @entity59 , @entity60 , a superintendent , plus two det chief inspectors , two detective inspectors , and one @entity63			0
one detective inspector was found to have a case to answer for misconduct but retired before the inquiry could be completed			2
nine men , including these eight , were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 - years - old by the summer of 2013 force investigators had identified the @entity73 should attend a formal misconduct hearing but they left the force in january 2014			1
the investigation - titled @entity77 - exposed flaws across all agencies in response to the challenges associated with child sexual exploitation , including a lack of understanding of the complexity of the issue			2
other failures were identified as issues , with information being shared across agencies that used different it systems , @entity7 's focus being on addressing serious acquisitive crime , and officers not having the necessary skill set			2
it also said the ' churn ' of staff at @entity5 , particularly in the inspecting ranks , meant that leadership of the issue could not be maintained , and there was little in the way of effective handover			0
shame : the abuse of the jailed gang began at two takeaways in the @entity110 area of @entity5 , including the @entity111 ( pictured ) , which is under new ownership the investigation identified one detective sergeant who made individual errors in his handling of the investigation , but it found that he had raised concerns about a need for more resources but was not supported by his superiors			1
others who were served notices included the former divisional chief superintendent , a superintendent , two detective chief inspectors , and two detective inspectors			1
they all received management action in respect of their performances			2
the report was split into two parts , one looking at the handling of the complaints made by two separate children , and the other looking into the wider decision - making by the @entity5 senior leadership there were signs for many years that men were using vulnerable young girls in @entity5 for sex , but no action was taken			1
here we highlight the failures			0
social workers from the outset , social workers failed to regard the teenage girls being passed around for sex among a gang of @entity16 men as victims			1
that was despite more than 100 reports of abuse from the victims , health workers and elsewhere linked to men working in taxi and takeaway businesses dating back to 2004 , and involving children as young as ten			1
instead the girls were treated as their attackers treated them , ' like prostitutes '			2
victims as young as ten were seen as ' making their own choice ' and ' engaging in consensual sexual activity '			1
in one case a parent making a complaint was told his daughter was ' hanging out with a bad crowd '			0
as a result of this catastrophic dereliction of duty , information was not systematically passed to the police , and the terrified victims were left at the mercy of a gang of violent sexual predators			2
police just as social workers failed to protect the victims from the rapists preying on them , so the police failed for years to grasp the nettle and launch a serious investigation			1
as well as reports from social workers , @entity7 received 44 referrals from the @entity195 about the abuse			0
in 2009 one victim , known as ' @entity198 ' , made a detailed complaint about the attacks			0
arrests were made but the case was dropped by state prosecutors			0
it was not until a year later that a full investigation was launched			0
police also failed to demand proper bail restrictions on the attackers			2
even after the trial , the police refused to acknowledge the racial element of the crimes , saying it was wrong to get ' hung up on race and ethnicity issues '			0
@entity216 an early police investigation in 2009 was passed to prosecutors but astonishingly no action was taken			0
instead a senior @entity216 prosecutor ' refused charge ' , claiming it was unlikely to lead to a successful trial			0
that was despite the existence of forensic evidence including dna swabs from a victim 's underwear			0
it was two years before that decision was overturned			0
yesterday 's report found prosecutors thought the main victim would be seen by the court as an unreliable witness , and blamed the cost of bringing the case and ' officer workload ' for the decision			0
the @entity242 members of the community would have known about the abuse of white girls being carried out by @entity37 men but did nothing to stop it			1
@entity249 , the former justice secretary , said there was ' denial ' around the issue			0
he said : ' these are small communities so people would have a rough idea that there is a group of men who are abusing white girls in this way			2
that has to be dealt with there , as well as much more effective police and social services action			0

hundreds of young girls were abused by *predominantly* - @entity37 gangs
