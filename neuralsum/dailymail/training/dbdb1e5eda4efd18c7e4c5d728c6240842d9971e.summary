' her aides later insisted she had ' misspoken ' and had meant to say ' allegations ' that the report was pulled inappropriately			0
but mrs @entity7 's intervention will add to the sense of crisis at the @entity15 over its handling of the scandal			1
@entity15 director general @entity48 will be grilled by @entity16 next week over the decision to not air the @entity4 investigation into @entity51 and also about how much was known at senior levels about the allegations			2
he will also face questions on whether wider concerns about a culture of sexual harassment at the @entity15 have been tackled			2
in an email to staff last night , @entity15 director of news @entity58 said the corporation was confident the investigation had been dropped for ' sound editorial reasons ' , but acknowledged that ' people have continued to speculate '			2

a lot of soul - searching is naturally taking place			0

he said : ' i do n't think the @entity15 can lead their own inquiry ... i think we need a broader look at these public institutions â€“ the @entity15 , i 'm afraid some parts of the @entity89 , potentially , @entity90			2
@entity15 director general @entity48 has offered to appear before a select committee ' i 'm open - minded about how it 's done but it 's got to be independent			1
' mr @entity77 also signalled he would support ' brave ' victims in their fight to get compensation			0

@entity133 mp @entity132 challenged mrs @entity7 in the @entity32 by saying : ' are you utterly convinced the culture of the @entity15 has changed since the revelations of the vile actions of @entity6 ? ' just a matter of weeks ago we had one of their senior talent caught in photographs in the grips of a young woman with his hand down her trousers in a public place			1
he gets away with it with nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders and a silly excuse			0
' you know this inquiry by the police will take years and that the @entity15 will get away in the smoke			2
surely now is the time for an independent inquiry into the @entity15 ? ' mrs @entity7 said a wider investigation into allegations of sexual harassment at the @entity15 was already under way , but that mr @entity164 was right to call for it to consider recent allegations			1
@entity12 called tonight for the government to set up an independent inquiry into the @entity6 sex abuse scandal to ' do right by the victims '			2

in order to do right by the victims i do n't think the @entity15 can lead their own inquiry			2
' we need a broad look at all the public institutions involved - the @entity15 , parts of the @entity89 and @entity90			0
this has got to be independent			0
' @entity12 wants an independent inquiry to have the power to demand documentation and witnesses			0
it should look into @entity6 's activities at the @entity15 , @entity196 hospital and @entity90 , the party said			1
' i think we now have enough set of allegations and further allegations to know this is not some isolated set of incidents , ' mr @entity77 said			0
' this seems to be a pattern of activity which spanned a number of institutions			0
as i say , i just think about the victims in this			0
this is absolutely horrific and will scar people for life			0
and i think for them , the @entity15 - good institution though it is - i do n't think they can lead their own inquiry			0
' responding to @entity77 's call for an independent inquiry , a government spokesman said last night : ' nothing has been ruled out , however , it would be incredibly premature to pre-judge the outcome of the @entity15 inquiries and the police investigation			1
' @entity6 at @entity222 in 2003 , where it is claimed he abused patients			0
