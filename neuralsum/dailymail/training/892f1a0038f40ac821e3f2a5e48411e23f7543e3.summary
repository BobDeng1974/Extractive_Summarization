by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 07:22 est , 2 may 2013 a handwritten memo sent by admiral @entity2 on the eve of the @entity4 shows that the naval hero had more on his mind than defeating the enemy			1
rather than worrying about battle plans , the 47 - year - old naval tactician was thinking about onions , and how the pursers of his fleet were profiteering by using up free government supplies of them and keeping the money for food for themselves			1
on october 10 , 1805 , @entity2 fired off a detailed bureaucratic missive , telling the purser of every ship of his fleet not to cheat the system			1
admiral @entity2 hand - wrote the memo on october 10 1805 , just 11 days before he died at the @entity4 the government was sending out free onions to the ships to ensure troops received adequate vitamin c while they were away on duty , but @entity2 had discovered that the pursers , whose job it was to manage the ships ' budgets , were using the government onions first and keeping the money they saved from their budgets for themselves			1
and as the @entity41 ships were busy blockading the combined @entity43 and @entity44 fleet at @entity45 , a gratuitous back - up supply of onions was shipped out to them to be used in soup by the government to prevent the troops developing scurvy			2
the document portrays the great naval hero as a prudent leader who was fiercely loyal to his employer at the time , the @entity41 government			0
it also shows that @entity2 had to deal with the tedious administrative matters of running a fleet just days before going into a vital battle in the @entity61			1
his signed memo reads : ' it is my positive directions that the @entity66 are obliged to purchase vegetables for the ships soup when it is possible to procure them and that the @entity72 onions are not used for the soup			1
' and it is my further directions , that whenever fresh provisions can be procured on reasonable terms , that it is purchased ; but that onions , for the account of @entity72 , are not purchased without my orders			0
@entity2 was a master naval tactician who died at the age of 47 when he was hit by a @entity43 sniper ' ships , absent for any length of time from me , are at liberty to purchase the gratuitous onions of @entity72 for the recruiting the health of their ships , who may have been long fed upon salt provisions			1
' the memo is one of two signed by @entity2 that is now being sold at auction in @entity97 , @entity98 , having been privately owned for more than 50 years			2
@entity99 , the curator of @entity2 's flagship @entity100 based at @entity102 , @entity103 , said the documents showed another side to @entity2			2
' @entity2 had a responsiblity to his employer , the government , to make sure they were n't getting ripped off ' he said : ' there were 31 ships in the fleet in total and each one had a purser			2
' the difficulty with keeping a ship at sea with a healthy crew was massive because of the lack of vitamin c from fresh fruit and vegetables			0
' the purser was required to supply these provisions and got to keep the money they did n't spend			0
sometimes they were not able to get hold of fresh produce if the ship was at sea for months			0
' where they could , the government replenished the stocks and sent out boat - loads of gratuitous onions , which were anti-scurvic			0
they contained vitamin c and were easy and cheap to grow			0
' but what was happening here was that when given the choice between the government onions or onions paid for out of their money , the pursers used the free ones			2
' in this memo @entity2 was telling them they could not use the government ones if they were able to buy them , otherwise the government was effectively paying twice			1
' @entity2 had a responsibility to his employer , the government and therefore the @entity41 people , and to make sure they were n't getting ripped off			0
@entity4 on october 21 1805 involved a fleet of 31 ships and was @entity41 's greatest naval victory ' a lot of people think of @entity2 for his brilliant military strategy and fighting battles at sea but here is the day - to - day minutiae of running a fleet , seemingly dull			1
' the memo , along with a second dated november 7 , 1803 , reminding seamen to take medical notes when going to hospitals in port , are to be sold by @entity171 for up to Â£ 2,000 each			0
@entity173 @entity172 said : ' i think it is quite surprising that just days before @entity4 , when you would have thought @entity2 's mind might be on how to defeat the @entity43 and @entity44 , he was getting a bee in his bonnet about onions			1
' the two documents are being sold by an unnamed woman from @entity183			0
the auction takes place on may 8 .			0

@entity66 often used free supplies and kept food budgets for themselves
