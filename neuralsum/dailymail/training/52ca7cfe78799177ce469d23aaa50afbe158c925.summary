by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:52 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 09:43 est , 14 november 2013 chancellor @entity2 is mulling the plan to persuade firms to take on more young people firms could be offered a tax cut if they hire unemployed young people			2
chancellor @entity2 is considering a plan which would mean national insurance was not pay for jobless under - 25s given work			1
while the total number of people out of work has fallen in the last year , the number of unemployed young people has remained stubbornly high at almost 1million			1
mr @entity2 is expected to use next month ’s @entity18 to unveil measures to get more people in their teens and twenties into work			2
latest figures show there were 965,000 unemployed people aged 16 - 15 , of which two third were not in full - time education			0
it has not changed at all in the last year , and is still 40 per cent higher than the level seen before the 2008 crash			0
under the plan put to mr @entity2 , businesses would not pay employer ’s national insurance contributions if they hire an unemployed person who is under 25			1
it is argued that the move would actually save the @entity40 money , because the £ 520 annual cost per young worker is less than paying them to be on benefits			1
in theory hiring every unemployed young person would cost £ 287million a year , compared to the £ 10billion bill for youth unemployment			1
the number of 18 to 24 - year - olds who have been out of work for more than a year has risen to 281,000			1
the numbers claiming @entity54 for more than two years has almost doubled this year			0
the idea is being pushed by the @entity57 campaign , which argues that money used for @entity54 would be better used to persuade firms to take on young people			0
flatlining : four years after the financial crash , the number of young people out of work has remained stubbornly high at around 1million director @entity57 said : ‘ despite all this talk of economic recovery , for many young people across the country nothing has changed			1
‘ youth unemployment continues to be sky high and hovers around one million – it has done for well over four years now			0
‘ hundreds of thousands of young people need wrap - around support , they should be matched and mentored into work so they can find and keep jobs			2
it is essential that we throw these vulnerable young people a lifeline			0
‘ this should be combined with a national insurance break for employers who take on one of the under - 25s and schools should be encouraged to make the most of their alumni ; having past pupils helping new school leavers navigate a dicey jobs market			1
’ recovery : for all adults aged 16 and over the unemployment rate has fallen sharply to a four - year low of 7.6 per cent mr @entity2 and his team have been briefed on the plan by @entity99 mp @entity98 , who urged the chancellor to announce the policy on december 5			1
‘ while our growth prospects are looking better and better , it is important we pay special attention to our young people , ’ mr @entity98 told @entity102 a senior @entity40 source added : ' @entity2 will do something to keep on tackling youth unemployment in the @entity18			2
he recognises this is an important priority			0
' @entity112 , director deneral of the @entity113 , said : ' it is absolutely right that the chancellor should be considering ways of tackling the @entity118 ’s unacceptably high level of youth unemployment			2
' @entity120 increases the cost of employing people			0
businesses would be more likely to take on extra staff if they had to pay less tax to do so			0
this also applies to jobseekers over 25			0

chancellor to use @entity18 to tackle unemployment *crisis*
number of young out of work remains stubbornly high despite recovery
*scrapping* national insurance for under - 25s would save £ 520 - a - year
