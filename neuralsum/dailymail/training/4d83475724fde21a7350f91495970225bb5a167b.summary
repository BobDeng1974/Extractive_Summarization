by @entity0 published : 00:03 est , 28 november 2012 updated : 04:42 est , 28 november 2012 warning : motorists are being urged to check the mileage on @entity4 certificates to avoid being accused of illegally ' clocking ' the odometer millions of motorists are urged today to check the car mileage printed on new - style @entity4 certificates to avoid being accused of illegally ‘ clocking ’ their own vehicles			1
the @entity12 says innocent law - abiding drivers who fail to check the mileages printed on the new @entity17 forms which were issued from last week may inadvertently be accused of turning back the mileage on their own cars if garages make mistake when writing it out			1
as a result millions of motorists are facing an mot ‘ ticking time - bomb ’ , says the motoring organisation			1
the @entity12 warns today in a new report : ‘ car owners who put their vehicle in for an @entity4 test and fail to check the mileage on the new certificate , introduced last week , may inadvertently end up with their own ‘ clocked ’ car			1
’ it notes : ’ the new certificate carries up to three of the previous recorded mileages			0
should the @entity4 test station make a mistake , the car owner has only seven days to get the tester to correct the error and issue a new certificate			2
if not , the car ’s mileage record is frozen and can not be changed			0
’ @entity12 head of public affairs @entity42 said : ‘ what was designed as a security measure to deter criminal clocking may bite back on the unwary			1
it is highly unlikely that the tester will make a mistake but the consequences are serious enough for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) to issue a specific warning			0
’ he said : ’ it would be extremely awkward for an innocent owner to be accused of clocking a vehicle when they try to sell it on or get it re-tested , because they had n’t checked the certificate			0
‘ with the clocking of vehicles rife in some parts of the country , threatening the safety and finances of used car buyers , the slight possibility of a mileage mistake during the @entity4 test is seen as a risk worth taking			1
’ government statistics show that 28.2million @entity4 tests are carried out every year , of which 26.6 million are for cars			2
check : a car 's recorded mileage can not be changed after seven days of its mot test according to new rules ( file picture ) the @entity12 said there had been concern that the @entity4 certificate printed by the tester could be forged or tampered with : ’ however , the new scheme allows a driver to check the mileage history on @entity53 ’s @entity4 computerisation database			1
this underlines the importance of the @entity4 certificate as a guide to rather than an endorsement of a car ’s roadworthiness , ownership or mileage validity			1
’ an official advice leaflet published by the @entity101 ’s @entity53 ( @entity53 ) called ‘ your mot certificate and odometer history ’ warns : ’ if your mot test was conducted on or after 18 november 2012 the @entity4 certificate will now show the vehicle ’s recent mileage history			2
' this has been introduced as part of a government initiative to reduce vehicle crime			0
‘ where available , the mileage history will compose of the readings associated with the three most recent @entity114 ( test passes ) along with the dates of those readings			0
this will be in addition to the mileage reading recorded at the time of the current test			0
’ it notes : ’ it is important that you check all details on your @entity4 certificate at the time of issue so that any errors can be rectified			1
if you find a mistake in the mileage reading recorded for the current test , the @entity4 garage that conducted the test will be able to correct the error within seven days of the test and issue a replacement certificate			2
’ but the official @entity53 leaflet adds : ’ where an earlier recorded mileage is higher than a later one this could be caused by for example a speedometer replacement or a mistake by the @entity145 at the time of recording the reading			0
alternatively it might suggest evidence of previous ‘ clocking ’ or tampering of the vehicle ’s mileage			0
’ it stresses ominously : ‘ please note that if there is an error in one or more of the previous mileage readings then this can not be changed			0

the @entity12 has warned that law abiding drivers who fail to check new @entity17 forms could be accused of turning back mileage
the organisation says that motorists face an @entity4 ' ticking time bomb '
