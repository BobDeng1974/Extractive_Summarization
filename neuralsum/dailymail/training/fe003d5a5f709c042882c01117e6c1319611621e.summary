by @entity0 older people 's brains are slower as they have more stored information , scientists have found elderly people 's brains are slower because they have stored up more information , researchers have said today			1
scientists from @entity9 in @entity10 believe the human brain works slower in old age as it has to process a lifetime of stored - up information to recall simple facts			1
they say their research proves instead of being weak - older brains are in fact more powerful			2
the team used computers to study cognitive development in age			0
they programmed a computer to learn new words and commands on a daily basis by ' reading ' - much like a human would learn			0
the researchers said cognitive tests conducted on a computers which had n't read much were comparable to the brains of a young adult - but those that read more were more like an elderly person 's			1
the ' older ' computer was certainly slower , researchers said , but only because its database had grown and it was having to process more information			2
they said their findings also explain why older people are often more forgetful			0
dr. @entity42 from the university said : ' the human brain works slower in old age but only because we have stored more information over time ' the brains of older people do not get weak			1
on the contrary , they simply know more			0
' speaking with the @entity53 , the scientist added : ' imagine someone who knows two people ’s birthdays and can recall them almost perfectly			0
' would you really want to say that person has a better memory than a person who knows the birthdays of 2000 people , but can ‘ only ’ match the right person to the right birthday nine times out of ten ? ' the study was published in the @entity67 in @entity68			0
in the study , the team remarked that certain tests used to determine older people 's mentality regularity favour the young			1
certain cognitive tests favour young people who do not have so much ' stored ' information , the study found in one particular test , called ' paired associated learning ' , people are asked to remember pairs of random objects			1
the scientists say this test is more difficult for older people - as , over their lifetime , they have learned the two objects never go together and so struggle to remember them as a couple			2
prof. @entity89 , who heads group who conducted the research added : ' the fact that older adults find nonsense pairs harder to learn than young adults simply demonstrates older adults ’ much better understanding of language			2
' they have to make more of an effort to learn unrelated word pairs because , unlike the youngsters , they know a lot about which words do n’t belong together			0

scientists at @entity9 , @entity10 say , older brains are n't weaker
instead believe they are just slower *due* to years of stored up information
say many tests used to determine brain power of elderly favour the young
