@entity1 researchers claim most acts of violence come from the desire to do the right thing the reasons behind violence are varied , but a common belief is that criminals act from a breakdown of morals			1
but now , researchers in @entity12 claim most acts of violence come from a very different impulse - the desire to do the right thing			1
their study argues that many violent attacks are committed as a form of retribution , with the aggressor feeling as though they must commit the crime			1
' when someone does something to hurt themselves or other people , or to kill somebody , they usually do so because they think they have to , ' professor @entity23 of the @entity24 said			1
' they think they should do it , that it 's the right thing to do , that they ought to do it and that it 's morally necessary			2
' co-author , professor @entity39 , of @entity40 , added : ' killings and physical attacks are often committed in retribution for wrongs - real or perceived			1
' [ they can be ] an effort to teach lessons and instill obedience or , amazingly , an attempt to rectify a relationship that in the perpetrator 's mind has gone awry			0
' ' when we say that violence is morally motivated , we mean that it is so in the mind of the perpetrator			0
we do n't mean that we think violence is good			0
' after emphasising they do n't condone violence , the researchers admit there are exceptions to their theory , typically psychopaths			1
professor @entity23 said : ' except for a few psychopaths , hardly anybody harming anybody else is doing something that they intend to be evil			1
the researchers have written a book , @entity70 , which outlines their controversial beliefs			1
they say they arrived at their conclusion after analysing a wide array of previous research on violence , including thousands of interviews with violent offenders			1
professor @entity23 at the @entity24 said : ' except for a few psychopaths , hardly anybody harming anybody else is doing something that they intend to be evil ' one example in the book is physical child abuse , with quotes from parents expressing fear of short - changing a child 's moral development on occasions when they withheld punishment			1
in domestic abuse , the researchers claim the aggressor is convinced they are in the right , with many abusers feeling entitled to use violence to redress wrongs that they perceive themselves to have suffered			1
professor @entity23 said : ' when we started we thought : " we 'll never figure out what really motivates perpetrators of violent acts " , but actually it turned out not to be that hard			2
' @entity108 workers and newspaper readers do n't think gang members should be killing each other , but within the gang they do			0
' he added : ' all you have to do is convince the people who are violent that what they 're doing is wrong			2
' @entity118 neurologist dr @entity117 claims to have found the ' evil patch ' in the brain 's central lobe ( ringed ) that lurks in violent criminals last year , a @entity118 neurologist claimed to have found the area of the brain where ' evil ' lurks in killers , rapists and robbers			1
@entity131 scientist dr @entity130 said the ' evil patch ' lies in the brain 's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on x-rays			2
he discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for @entity118 government studies			2
' we showed these people short films and measured their brain waves , ' he said			0
' whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions			0
in the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow , nothing happened			0
' the dark mass at the front of the brain , he says , appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence			0
his research has led him to believe that some criminals have a ' genetic predisposition ' to violence			0
he added : ' when you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals , there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain			0
' there are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area , and after an operation to remove the tumour , that person was completely normal again			0
' or there are physiological deficits , because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively			0
' but this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks			2

@entity1 researchers claim that most violent crimes are not intended to be evil
in a new book , titled @entity70 they say killings and physical attacks are often committed in retribution for wrongs - real or perceived
study by the @entity24 claims the exception is psychopaths
