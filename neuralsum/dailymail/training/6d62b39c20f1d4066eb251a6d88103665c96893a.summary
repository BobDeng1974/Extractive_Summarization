by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 14:23 est , 12 february 2013 the next generation xbox console will require @entity4 's @entity3 motion sensors to be connected when playing games , according to games industry sources			1
the machine - the follow up to the hugely successful @entity8 - will also feature new - look control pads and be capable of simultaneously running apps alongside video games			1
having @entity3 as a requirement has raised eyebrows among gamers as it is still widely criticised by ' hardcore ' gamers for being a gimmick that adds little value to games			1
successor : the @entity8 is a hugely popular system , but recent games have showed a gulf in the graphical quality between its aging hardware and the current crop of pcs that 's despite @entity4 having sold 20million of the motion - sensor units			1
the new machine is codenamed @entity32			2
a source who is said to have previously revealed details on games consoles , told @entity36 he has had access to the development kits			0
the source went on to describe the graphical leap between @entity32 and the current 360 to echo the difference between @entity42 on the original @entity43 and @entity44 on a high - powered pc			2
the website claims that a new @entity3 - style motion control will be included with every @entity32 sold , and must be plugged in and calibrated for the console to even function			1
it will also ' always be watching you ' , with a new camera able to track up to six individual skeletons in the same room at all times			0
this would suggest that the system could instantly identity the person and also be related to the recently - patented @entity4 system for monitoring or charging users based on who is watching what			2
the quality of the @entity3 camera has been improved , too , with reports that it is capable of tracking thumb movement or recognise when your hand is open and closed			1
other reports suggest it can also recognise when you are angry , sad and exited			1
@entity73 reveal : @entity74 are almost certain to showcase their next - gen console on february 20 the next xbox console could require gamers to be permanently connected to the internet - ruling out the use of second - hand games , according to a magazine report			1
the next - generation console will ' be absolutely committed to online functionality ' , says the magazine , quoting sources with first - hand experience of @entity4 's latest console			2
gamers will be required to activate games in the same way as most other software from @entity4 and other publishers is already activated online , the report in @entity84 claimed			0
this would mean that the game is tied to the console it is activated on , and to the @entity97 account activating it , making it impossible to sell on old games			2
an activation system would check that you are the registered user of the game each time you start it up - you would n't even be able to lend it to a friend			0
the site claims the new @entity43 will run on custom hardware , including an 8 - core , 64 - bit cpu running at 1.6ghz , 800mhz @entity111 graphics processor units and custom hardware blocks to take help take the pressure off the cpu			0
the console is also reportedly capable of delivering stereo 3d content and ships with built - in wifi			0
audio output will be via either @entity119 or @entity120 ( optical ) and can support 7.1 channels			0
it will ship with @entity125 hard drive , too			0
@entity126 , @entity32 titles can be designed in sections , so the now mandatory installations can take place automatically while you play			0
sadly , @entity36 claims that @entity8 controllers will not work with @entity32 as @entity4 are using what they call a ' new wireless technology '			1
@entity74 , meanwhile , have kept their hand even closer to their chest regarding their next - generation console			1
however , it is widely expected that they will reveal their ps3 successor at a major event in @entity141 on feburary 20			0
@entity4 will likely wait until @entity142 to make an announcement with the console expected to retail at the end of the year .			0

new console , code - named ' @entity32 ' , can simultaneously run apps and video games , according to *rumours*
reports claim highly - advanced @entity3 sensor can track the slightest body movements and recognise if person is angry , sad or happy
@entity8 controllers will not work with @entity32
