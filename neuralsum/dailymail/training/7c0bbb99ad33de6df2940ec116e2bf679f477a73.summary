the body said that advertising for unhealthy snacks and confectionary should be banned on children 's television to help the @entity3 's 1.3million obese children lose weight			1
@entity15 also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to ' deal with this problem head on '			1
the agency , which started operations yesterday , has a wide - ranging remit to ' protect and improve the nation 's health and wellbeing '			0
@entity3 children are in need of personalised weight loss programmes to combat an obesity epidemic , according to the new watchdog @entity15 professor @entity30 , the agency 's director of health improvement and @entity33 , said that authorities should use ' local individual plans ' as part of a ' range of effective tools ' to combat obesity			1
he suggested that restaurants should also reduce portion sizes for children and promote healthier food			1
professor @entity30 said that information on pupils ' height and weight , which is already collected by schools and passed to the @entity50 , could be utilised more effectively			0
he told the @entity51 : ' innovation can be put in place at the local level when local councils understand the nature of the epidemic and take steps to help to intervene			0
' recent figures show that a tenth of @entity3 children are obese when they start school , while twice many are obese when starting senior school			0
overall , a third of children are overweight or obese by the time they are in their final year at primary school			0
in 2011/12 , 9.5 per cent of children in reception class aged four and five were classed as obese , rising to one in five pupils in year six aged ten and 11			0
fuelling the epidemic is a lack of attention from parents , with almost half of parents whose children are obese wrongly stating that their children were ' about the right weight '			1
the watchdog also suggested that councils should be given the power to formulate health programmes to deal with obesity head on a recent @entity50 briefing suggested that current obesity rates are worse , with 22 per cent of four to five - year - olds classed as obese and 34 per cent of 10 to 11 - year - olds			2
referring to @entity3 's ' obesogenic environment ' , professor @entity30 said : ' it is about being mindful about what we are offering to our kids and ensuring we are looking at portion control and healthier options in schools , pubs or community - all of us have a role to play			2
speaking about a potential ban on unhealthy food adverts on children 's television , he added : ' are we ensuring that we do n't have access to unhealthy tv adverts at a time when kids are watching television			1
should we be thinking about how those advertisements are being placed ? ' in other countries they have delinked advertisements which promote toys and food , adverts that promote kids coming into restaurant establishments , that is one of the options that is being looked at			0
' the warning comes shortly after doctors claimed that parents are creating a ' cancer timebomb ' by letting their children spend too long sitting down			0
the experts also claimed that children are being put at risk of heart disease , obesity and diabetes because of their sedentary lifestyles .			2
