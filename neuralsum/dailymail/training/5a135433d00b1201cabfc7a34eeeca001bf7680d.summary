@entity0 is ready to persist with @entity1 in @entity3 ’s starting line - up against @entity4 and give him the chance to turn his season around			1
with just one goal in 10 matches since his £ 16million move from @entity8 , @entity1 ’s displays have been so mundane that @entity3 may decide to offload him in january if it proves that he can not adapt to their style of play			1
the @entity16 striker was hauled off after 45 minutes of the 3 - 0 defeat by @entity18 on wednesday			1
even though @entity27 is waiting in the wings , @entity1 is expected to start on saturday afternoon at @entity29 against @entity31 ’s side			1
@entity3 ’s manager would not shy away from making the big call to drop @entity1 but , for the moment , @entity0 is prepared to keep faith with the 24 - year - old and he will lead the line as his side chase a third consecutive win in the @entity40			1
@entity1 and @entity18 's @entity26 exchanged jerseys as the players made their way down the tunnel for half - time @entity1 angered the home support and guaranteed a few more headlines by swapping shirts with @entity18 's @entity26 it has been a difficult 48 hours for @entity1 , as he has been the subject of a complaint to @entity52 over allegations he verbally threatened a woman in the @entity56 area on thursday afternoon after it was said she took photos of his £ 250,000 @entity59			1
his alleged victim told the @entity61 : ‘ i had n’t even taken any pictures			2
he came and looked through the front window			2
‘ he was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright			0
i do n’t care who he is , i wo n’t be threatened like that			0
’ what @entity3 could do with more than anything on saturday is collecting three points with neither a hint of controversy nor the concession of a goal			1
@entity1 arrived at @entity3 's @entity78 training ground in his red @entity59 the morning after the @entity18 match @entity1 was the subject of a complaint to @entity52 over allegations he threatened a woman but that will be easier said than done against a @entity4 team for whom @entity0 says he has the utmost respect			1
such have been @entity3 ’s travails in recent weeks that @entity0 has admitted to being up in his kitchen in the middle of the night , attempting to work out a formula that will get his team back in the form that saw them finish runners - up last year			1
‘ the other night i was up at 4.30am , down in my kitchen , looking and thinking of ways that i could make us better and improve , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ that is something i have got , a hunger to make this group better			0
‘ yeah , we are looking to get balance in the team — balance is the most important thing in football — but with limited coaching time			2
that is something i have to look at definitely			0
’ @entity1 is just one of the problems that @entity3 manager @entity0 is still trying to figure out this season @entity3 have conceded 19 goals in 12 matches this season and only kept one clean sheet in 18 games since march 30 but @entity0 has robustly dismissed bringing in a defensive coach , a topic that has been raised by supporters			1
when asked if he had given thought to the idea , @entity0 said : ‘ no. no. no chance			0
no. when i came in , i was asked whether i would have someone to come in and help the strikers score			0
i think it is just the lack of coaching time that is impacting			2
‘ listen , we ca n’t complain			0
we are in the big competitions and there is an expectancy on us , which there should be			0
‘ but in terms of that ( recruiting a defensive coach ) , we do n’t need it			0
’ @entity3 have let in 19 goals in 12 games this season and kept one clean sheet in 18 games since march 30			2
