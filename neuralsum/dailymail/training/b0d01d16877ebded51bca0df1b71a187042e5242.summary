the @entity7 has been designed at huge expense to fly unnoticed through enemy airspace and attack targets without being detected			1
taxpayers have already spent £ 1.3 billion developing the jet , while the @entity4 plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £ 100 million each			1
huge cost : taxpayers have already spent £ 1.3billion developing the f - 35 jet , while the @entity4 plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £ 100million each but now , defence experts have revealed that the aircraft can be spotted by @entity21 and @entity22 radar systems			1
@entity24 , from the @entity23 , confirmed the stealth capability has been compromised and that the @entity27 ’s foes are poised to take advantage			0
she said : ‘ there has been an evolution of radar technology and yes , we should be worried			1
the @entity21 air defence system might be able to spot the @entity7 while the technology fitted to @entity22 destroyers is concerning because you will have greater resolution and you will be able to tell with greater certainty what the plane is			1
‘ the key question is whether the @entity7 would be able to engage first , before being spotted			1
how the aircraft is operated in combat will come into play			0
' the @entity21 are making a big push in anti-aircraft technology while the combination of technologies being used by the @entity22 is interesting			1
’ mrs @entity24 agreed that the @entity7 ’s stealth capability had been one of its main assets			2
asked how much of a blow the stealth problems are , she added : ‘ it depends what you think you ’re going to come up against			0
' the @entity58 will argue that there is no point spending all this money and that we should be spending more on body armour and tanks			0
’ future : the jets will fly from the @entity67 's new queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier in 2018 at a cost of £ 4.8billion defence secretary @entity69 is committed to buying 48 of the jump - jet variants of the aircraft to fly from the @entity67 ’s new queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers from 2018 , at an estimated total cost of £ 4.8 billion			1
until now the @entity7 ’s invisibility – called ‘ very @entity79 ’ or @entity81 stealth – had been achieved through its shape and paintwork , the formula for which is highly classified			2
stealth aircraft use flat surfaces and sharp edges to deflect radar signals and evade detection			2
the new threat to the @entity7 comes from a new system called @entity89 – @entity89 – which works by emitting separate radio waves on different frequencies			2
by rapidly changing frequencies , the radar is more difficult to fool			0
@entity22 has incorporated @entity89 into a new radar system which it is fitting to its latest warships			2
the system is apparently capable of locating a stealth aircraft within 220 miles			0
military experts claim the jet , which is also used by the @entity100 , can be picked up on @entity21 and @entity22 radars meanwhile , @entity27 and @entity103 fighter pilots are continuing to test fly prototypes of the @entity7 at @entity106 air base in @entity107			1
test flights have also revealed computer software problems and performance issues when the aircraft is flown in bad weather – including fears that the jet could explode if struck by lightning			0
pilots have also criticised their high - tech helmets			0
the jet , which as a top speed of 1,300mph and a maximum range of 1,450 miles , combines technologies developed by @entity27 and @entity103 companies , including @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , which is assembling the jets			0
last night , the company was unavailable for comment , but the @entity4 said : ‘ [ @entity7 ] is the most advanced combat jet in the world , and from 2018 will provide the @entity67 and @entity131 with unprecedented stealth capability as well state - of - the - art sensors and weapons			1
the aircraft has been specifically designed to be updated throughout its lifetime to ensure it can benefit from new technology to counter emerging threats and keep ahead of our enemies			0

@entity7 can be spotted by @entity21 and @entity22 radars
@entity4 plans to buy 48 at a cost of £ 100million each
experts say there has been a development in radar technology
@entity152 will fly from new queen elizabeth class aircraft carrier in 2018
