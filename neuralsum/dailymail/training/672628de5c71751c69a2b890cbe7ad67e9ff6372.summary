by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed a mobile phone with a built in 3d scanner that could revolutionise navigation			1
called @entity5 , the phone can build up a live @entity8 map of its surrounding area			2
it will initially only be sold to developers , who @entity1 hope will develop everything from satnav apps to games similar to those found on @entity18 's @entity17 , which uses the @entity20 sensor			1
these sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3d measurements every second , updating it ’s position and orientation in real - time , combining that data into a single 3d model of the space around you			2
' @entity5 strives to give mobile devices a human - like understanding of space and motion through advanced sensor fusion and computer vision , enabling new and enhanced types of user experiences – including 3d scanning , indoor navigation and immersive gaming , ' said @entity56 , the technical lead on the programme			1
the handset can take 250,000 3d measurements a second it was created by @entity63 's @entity5 division , which last week joined @entity1			2
' the goal of @entity5 is to give mobile devices a human - scale understanding of space and motion , ' it said			0
the phone has a compass and gyros , just like any other phone , but in addition , has @entity20 - like visual sensors that can scan the room around the phone			1
in its announcement , @entity1 asks : ' what if you could capture the dimensions of your home simply by walking around with your phone before you went furniture shopping ? what if directions to a new location did n’t stop at the street address ? what if you never again found yourself lost in a new building ? ' how it works : depth sensing and motion tracking sensors allow the handset to know exactly where it is , and it can create a ' live ' 3d map of its surroundings			0
the team has spent over a year on the project , operating in secret from @entity63 's hq			0
' the team has been working with universities , research labs , and industrial partners spanning nine countries around the world for the last year to harvest research from the last decade of work in robotics and computer vision , concentrating that technology into a unique mobile phone			1
' now , we ’re ready to put early prototypes into the hands of developers that can imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality			1
' a live map created by the handset the firm believes gaming could be one of the first uses of the system			0
' imagine playing hide - and - seek in your house with your favorite game character , or transforming the hallways into a tree - lined path			0
imagine competing against a friend for control over territories in your home with your own miniature army , or hiding secret virtual treasures in physical places around the world ? '			0

phone will only be sold to app developers
could be used for indoor navigation and *augmented* reality games
