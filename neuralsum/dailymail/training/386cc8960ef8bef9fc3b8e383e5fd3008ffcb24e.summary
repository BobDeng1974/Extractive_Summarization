earlier this month , after @entity1 scored twice against @entity2 at @entity3 , the @entity0 forward claimed nothing could beat a north @entity6 derby			1
against @entity10 , the team any fair - minded @entity0 supporter can not contemplate losing to , the boy - who - can - do - no - wrong scored a dramatic equaliser after 95 minutes and 54 seconds			1
@entity1 ’s timing is impeccable			2
@entity0 can win the @entity12 , at @entity13 , against @entity14 , the @entity16 leaders on sunday and - seriously - you will not see celebrations like this			1
@entity1 scored with the last kick of the game as @entity0 fought back from two goals down to draw with @entity10 @entity23 leaps in between @entity0 's central defender 's to head home the opening goal of the game at @entity3 the 25 - year - old @entity29 midfielder watches as his header beats @entity31 in the 22nd minute summer signing @entity32 doubles the @entity10 lead with a well - taken half volley from a tight angle @entity31 ca n't keep out @entity32 's shot even though the @entity38 was standing at his near post @entity40 strikes to pull one back for @entity0 with 10 minutes remaining in the match in north @entity6 @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity31 7 ; @entity43 5.5 , @entity44 5 , @entity45 5.5 , @entity46 6.5 ; @entity47 5 ( @entity48 80 , 6 ) , @entity49 5.5 , @entity50 5 ( @entity51 60 , 5.5 ) , @entity52 4.5 ( @entity53 46 , 6 ) , @entity54 5.5 ; @entity1 7			1

the place was bedlam , with young and old hugging each other in the old stands , uncertain whether to turn to @entity1 as he celebrated in front of the @entity93 or flick two fingers at the 2,868 @entity10 supporters			1
in the end they did both			0
whatever makes them happy , because this was a rank @entity0 performance as they hurtle towards a week when they must at least score and draw with @entity103 to make progress in the @entity105			0
they were saved here by the stupidity of @entity109 , foolishly lulled into the shove on @entity1 in the 94th minute that predictably , had to be , a penalty			1
the @entity0 forward is a clever so - and - so			0
‘ you can see why he ’s give it - @entity109 has put his hands on him , ’ admitted @entity10 ’s manager @entity113			1
the poor fella ’s bubble has well and truly burst at @entity120 and it is n’t just because they threw away a two - goal lead at the home of their greatest rivals			0
he even found it hard to credit @entity1			0
‘ it was lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish it off , ’ he added			2
without the perseverance of @entity1 , 24 goals to the good as he goes head to head with @entity135 for the @entity137 young player of the year award , @entity0 would not have rescued a point here			2
they were two nil down to @entity10 , thrown out of kilter by the constant , menacing presence of @entity67 in the centre of midfield alongside @entity109			2
they pretty much won everything in there			0
it was only when @entity67 was substituted in the 66th minute , a sensible decision before his tiring legs caught one too many @entity0 players , that @entity10 lost their grip on the game			1
until then he had excelled , save for his inevitable booking , and he had even set up the second goal for @entity113 ’s team in the 62nd minute			0
back to the beginning , though , and the moment @entity10 supporters could , with some justification , sing ‘ @entity0 , it ’s happening again ’			1
the reasoning behind @entity162 ’s decision to withdraw @entity52 at half - time in favour of @entity165 ( and @entity166 only knows why he did not start ) lay in the midfielder ’s error in the build up to @entity23 ’s 22nd minute header			1
shuffling around on the ball , idling with it on the edge of the @entity0 penalty area while you wait for a wide - eyed eastender who is foaming at the mouth is not the way to approach a game of this significance			2
@entity109 brings down @entity1 in the final minute of the game to give away a penalty at @entity3 @entity1 takes the subsequent spot - kick but @entity61 guesses right and saves the initial shot @entity1 missed the penalty but scored the rebound with the final kick of the game on sunday afternoon @entity0 's 24 - goal striker wheels away after scoring the equaliser in the final seconds of the match @entity23 salutes the @entity10 supporters after scoring in the @entity16 clash with @entity0 on sunday @entity32 makes the @entity10 sign after doubling the visitors ' lead in the second half @entity32 is congratulated by his @entity10 team - mates after scoring the second goal of the afternoon in the second half @entity0 captain @entity31 makes a superb save from @entity199 to keep the score at 1 - 0 during the first half @entity10 pinched the ball off @entity52 ’s toes , @entity204 steered in a cross from the left and @entity23 , predictably , caught @entity207 and @entity44 napping			1
on the touchline @entity113 was in full combat mode , barking at fourth official @entity210 over a series of innocuous decisions before @entity10 took command of this game			2
the guy is under pressure , with some serious decisions to be made up in the @entity10 boardroom after @entity219 was ambushed by an angry mob in the car park at the @entity222 last week			0
he looked good for the three points here , their first since january 18 , when @entity32 slid in the at the far post to meet @entity67 ’s 62nd minute cross swung in from the left			2
they should have seen it through , even without @entity67 for the last 24 minutes and the enforced substitution of the substitute @entity68 because he pulled up lame with a hamstring injury			0
until then , @entity0 had poked around a bit in midfield without ever looking likely to score			0
@entity1 shot tamely wide and @entity40 headed over the crossbar in an ultimately dreadful first half performance			1
the second was n’t much better , that was until @entity61 punched away @entity54 ’s cross from the right and into the path of @entity0 ’s left back on the edge of the area			2
@entity46 ’s effort , partially botched and completely fortuitous , was driven into the ground and somehow beat the sightline of @entity10 ’s keeper in the 81st minute			2
he owed his team - mates for that , brilliantly pawing away @entity51 ’s shot two minutes later as @entity3 responded to the growing sense that something special was about to happen			0
when it did , deep into injury - time , @entity1 ’s penalty was initially saved by @entity61 before the @entity0 striker reacted quickest to the rebound to make it 2 - 2			1
after a finish like that , nothing can beat it			0
