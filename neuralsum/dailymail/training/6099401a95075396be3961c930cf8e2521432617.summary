by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 have issued a ' hands - off ' warning to @entity4 as the @entity4 start the search for a new manager			1
@entity8 ’s departure from the @entity9 for @entity10 , which was confirmed on tuesday evening , prompted a whirlwind of speculation over who is to succeed him , and @entity16 ’s name was among those in the mix. @entity19 and @entity20 were being quoted as the bookmakers ’ favourites , but @entity16 ’s odds were slashed overnight			1
safe pair of hands : @entity16 kept @entity2 in the @entity26 when relegation looked certain however , it is understood the @entity29 club will resist any attempt to lure the 46 - year - old @entity31 back to the @entity32 , where he enjoyed a successful spell with @entity35 before an acrimonious departure and his subsequent move to @entity2 , who he guided to @entity26 safety			1
@entity40 12/1 * odds provided by @entity42 @entity16 ’s stock has risen markedly in recent months after he replaced @entity44 at the @entity45 with the club having collected just a single point from its first seven games prior to his arrival			1
remarkably he took them to the @entity53 final , where they were eventually beaten by @entity55 after taking a shock lead			0
however , the @entity2 looked destined to return to the @entity57 when they found themselves seven points adrift at the foot of the table with just six games left to play , only to mount a remarkable fightback which saw them take seven points from trips to @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 on the way to a 14th - placed finish			2
@entity73 master : @entity20 is among the candidates to replace @entity8 at @entity4 contender : @entity76 coach @entity19 is another name mentioned in contention for the @entity4 job after the turmoil of the @entity44 era , @entity16 ’s approach has provided a breath of fresh air , although there remains an element of uncertainty over his future			1
there was disquiet in the boardroom over his assertion that the perennial fight for survival might suggest that there was something wrong within the club beyond the powers of successive managers , and as he celebrated what he referred to as ' the greatest escape ' , his future remained the main topic for debate			0
speaking after a final day defeat by @entity105 , @entity16 said : ' now i will have a meeting with the chairman because it ’s natural , natural because yes , i want to know where we are going , if it ’s possible not to make the same mistakes that we have made in the last couple of years because i do n’t was n’t to go through another year like this one			2
' it ’s natural , it ’s natural			0
there are teams who start the season and the aim is to stay up , so 12th to 17th			0
' are we that team ? i do n’t know			0
or are we goig to go for the top 10 in a better way ? ' content : @entity2 owner @entity127 is believed to want to keep @entity16 at the club following his good work at the same time , @entity16 , who expressed his admiration for the @entity4 last season , insisted he expected still to be in charge at the start of the new campaign , and he and director of football @entity135 are busily working on their transfer targets as they attempt to avoid the mistakes made 12 months ago			1
it is understood there is little appetite for change either within the hierarchy and that owner @entity127 is prepared to fight to hang on to a head coach who is understandably hugely popular with the fans			0
despite the speculation , it was business as usual for @entity16 and @entity152 on wednesday as they completed their first summer signing by landing out - of - contract @entity156 defender @entity155 on a four - year - deal			2
significantly , the 27 - year - old , who will formally join the club on july 1 , is @entity164 and has top - flight experience in this country , combined attributes none of last summer ’s 14 signings could boast			0
addition : @entity155 has signed for @entity2 after his contract at @entity156 expired			2

@entity2 keen to retain boss following @entity26 survival
@entity4 eye @entity16 after @entity8 departure
@entity2 keen for *stability* after recent managerial upheaval
@entity16 wants *guarantees* of *ambition* from @entity181
