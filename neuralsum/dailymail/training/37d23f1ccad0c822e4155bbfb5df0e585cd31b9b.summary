by @entity0 published : 14:59 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 15:00 est , 29 january 2013 shops in @entity2 have been ordered to put up walls to separate their male and female employees in accordance with the country â€™s strict vice laws			1
the barriers need to be at least 5ft 3in high and will keep staff from seeing and communicating with workers of the opposite sex			2
this follows @entity2 's strict interpretation of @entity14 which prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from socialising			1
segregation : shops in this mall in @entity21 , @entity2 will have to erect barriers to separate their male and female employees as religious law prevents mingling of men and women who are not blood relatives the news comes only days after the religious police , known as the @entity30 , said there would be no punishment for men who frequent shopping malls and public spaces in their underwear			1
the new and controversial trend among young men is to go out in public wearing only undershirts and trousers , normally worn underneath the traditional robes			0
despite complaints about the new trend , @entity45 spokesman @entity44 dismissed rumours of a ban of the practice , leaving it up to shopping centre security whether they deem it inappropriate			0
equality has been a slow process in @entity2 , where women are still not allowed to drive a car , must use separate entrances at banks and offices , and follow strict dress codes			2
they also need permission from a male relative or their husband to work , travel , study or marry and a woman 's testimony counts for less than that of a man in a court of law			0
restriction : male attendants in a shop selling abayas , the female black robe , are only allowed minimum contact with a female customer even when she is chaperoned by a male relative or her husband controlled : the life of a @entity2 woman is regulated by the country 's sharia law and she may not travel , study or marry without a male relative 's permission and must always follow the strict dress code seen in this picture a small step forward was announced by @entity89 last year as he opened up the government advisory council to both sexes			1
earlier this month women were appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150 - member @entity94 as @entity89 reconstituted the council for a new four - year term			0
although the women can attend the assembly , they will be separated from their male colleagues by a screen and will join the debate via an internal communication system			0
to comply with the kingdom 's @entity106 sharia law , the @entity94 building must now be altered to include a separate entrance for women .			2
