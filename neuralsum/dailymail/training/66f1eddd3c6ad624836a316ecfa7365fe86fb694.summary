by @entity0 published : 19:51 est , 5 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:12 est , 9 december 2013 diet disaster : yet @entity4 's still slim - and healthy with her clear skin , supermodel - long legs and slim figure , @entity4 looks like she knows how to look after herself			1
such a physique , one assumes , must be down to a disciplined regime of exercise coupled with a restricted and controlled diet			2
and , yes , certainly , one of those points is true : @entity4 's diet is indeed restrictive , but not in the way you 'd expect			1
lunch is always tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips , and dinner is , again , tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburger and chips			2
no fruit , vegetables , fresh meat or fish			1
just processed , salty and fatty rubbish , day after day , all washed down with litres of sugar - packed @entity35 or cola			1
very occasionally , she 'll deviate and have a @entity39 takeaway of noodles with sweet and sour sauce , and she 's recently discovered a liking for breaded mozzarella sticks , but mostly she sticks to tomato and cheese pizza or cheeseburgers and chips			2
when her story broke in the mail last month — in which @entity4 described herself as a junk food addict — it led to the obvious question : what on earth must she be doing to her health ? surely , as commentators pointed out at the time , this ostensibly fit and strong body must be masking a host of medical horrors within , which were fast catching up with her			1
this was a question @entity4 — who , incidentally , does absolutely no exercise and up until two months ago smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day — herself had often pondered , with understandable trepidation			1
only after meeting @entity4 , and putting her through a raft of medical tests , is the true conundrum of her size 10 - 12 figure revealed			1
i can confirm she is a medical oddity			2
we meet over lunch , where i observe @entity4 bolting down a double cheeseburger ( she specifies no salad or gherkins ) , large chips and a @entity82 at @entity83			1
i venture the obvious suggestion that @entity4 's terrible eating habits must have started at home			1
she insists , vehemently , they did n't			2
' the thing that upsets my mum the most is when people assume this was how she raised me , ' says @entity4 , who works as a carer at a local residential home and still lives with parents @entity94 , 43 , an administrator , and father @entity97 , 45 , a lorry driver			1
' she hates me eating like this and she tried so hard to get me to eat healthily as a child			2
' her family — which includes sisters @entity103 , 23 , and @entity105 , 19 — are very close and @entity4 explains that sitting down to a home - cooked meal was always a cornerstone of their family life			1
' when we were at school we 'd all sit together and talk about what we 'd been doing and any problems we had			0
' except while the rest of her family enjoyed home - made casseroles and lasagnes , @entity4 would refuse to eat anything but chips			1
sometimes she 'd even leave the dining table to eat them in another room as she was unable to stand the smell of her mother 's home - cooked meals			2
it 's enough to make most parents scoff with derision			0
surely all that was needed here was a bit of discipline , but @entity4 insists she was not acting out of teenage faddiness or as an over-indulged brat , her problems were deep - rooted and had begun when she was a toddler			1
' @entity135 could n't get me to take anything but milk , ' @entity4 says			1
' that was all i 'd want			0
she tried desperately to wean me onto meat and pasta and vegetables — she 'd turn meals into funny faces , anything to tempt me — but i just refused			1
' people would say i was just fussy , someone even advised her to lock me in my room , that i would eat when i was hungry , but nothing worked			0
and there were times i 'd go two days without eating anything			0
that 's when she 'd get really worried			0
junk food addict : @entity4 does absolutely no exercise and up until two months ago smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day over lunch , @entity4 bolts down a double cheeseburger ( she specifies no salad or gherkins ) , large chips and a @entity82 at @entity83 ' finally , when i was about five @entity135 and @entity162 discovered i would eat chips			1
but then that 's all i 'd eat			0
' one doctor warned that if i did n't start eating a more balanced diet i could be dead by 20			2
' desperate to identify the root of the problem , @entity94 took @entity4 to a succession of doctors			1
the only diagnosis they could reach was that @entity4 was a picky eater			1
it was n't until she was 15 that a new gp referred @entity4 to the @entity175 at @entity176 and tests revealed she suffered chronic gastro - oesophageal reflux			1
it 's caused when the muscle at the bottom of the gullet stops working properly , allowing stomach acid to leak up the oesophagus into the mouth , causing an extreme burning sensation — heartburn — and an unpleasant taste			0
long - term sufferers are at a slightly higher risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus			2
often genetic , it runs in @entity4 's father 's side of the family , but it had never been picked up in @entity197			1
doctors now think she had it from birth			0
@entity4 's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production , but her relationship with food had been ruined since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer , @entity4 has put on more than a stone in weight ' every time i ate it hurt and my food did n't taste nice , ' she says			1
' it still happens now , but as a child i did n't understand			0
that 's why i did n't want to eat anything , and why i was attracted to milk and chips			0
' sufferers are often told to drink milk as it has a soothing effect because it coats the lining of the oesophagus			0
some stodgy foods are thought to help minimise acid production			0
after diagnosis , @entity4 's condition was initially controlled with medication to inhibit acid production , but her relationship with food had been ruined			1
by now , it was a full - blown phobia she could n't overcome			2
just the smell of some food is enough to make her flee a room in revulsion and the thought of swallowing anything ' unsafe ' sends her into a panic			2
yet she did persevere : after counselling @entity4 finally moved on from milk and chips and ate her first pizza at 15 — her parents were delighted — then her first burger two years later			1
health concerns : @entity4 with her grandmother @entity246 further progress remains very , very slow : it takes her years to pluck up the courage to try new things			1
it 's not a disorder that attracts instant sympathy			0
strangers can be downright rude about her eating habits , particularly when they see her figure			2
and she used to be much slimmer than she is today			0
since quitting smoking after her grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer , @entity4 has put on more than a stone in weight			1
yet at 5ft 9ins , she weights 11st 4lbs and is still enviably slim			0
' i get a lot of criticism about my diet from strangers , ' admits @entity4			1
' people tell me i 'm going to die young if i keep eating like this , that i must be really unhealthy and that i 'm going to look old before my time			0
' and i know it makes @entity135 sad that she ca n't cook for me			0
she 's always really happy when i try something new			0
she 's always coming home from the supermarket with new things to tempt me			0
' recently it was sticks of mozzarella covered with breadcrumbs and she was delighted that i liked them			0
' she occasionally gets me to take a multivitamin tablet , but still worries about the impact of my diet on my health			0
' and it 's not just her health which suffers			0
@entity4 , who is single , concedes her love life has been affected			2
' when i 'm asked out i explain that all i eat are pizzas , burgers and chips			0
it means i do n't ever get to go for romantic meals , though i joke that at least i 'm a cheap date			0
' and come @entity291 she wo n't be enjoying a festive dinner with the rest of the family			0
unable to bear the smell of cooked sprouts and roast meat , she 'll be in the next room with @entity39 noodles and sweet and sour sauce			2
' i 'd love to be able enjoy a family meal just once , ' she says wistfully			0

@entity4 looks like she knows how to look after herself
but the junk food addict eats no fruit , vegetables , fresh meat or fish
she also does no exercise and had smoked up to 20 cigarettes a day
so how does @entity4 maintain her size 10 - 12 figure
