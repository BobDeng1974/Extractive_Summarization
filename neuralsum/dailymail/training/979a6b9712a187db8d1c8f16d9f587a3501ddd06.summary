by @entity0 published : 07:21 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 10:24 est , 3 august 2012 the icy waters of the @entity2 would hardly be most people 's first choice for a day at the the beach			0
but for these fearless surfers it provides the perfect destination for monster waves			1
the daredevils braved the chilly conditions in the crystal clear water as they enjoyed the powerful swells off the @entity14 , in @entity15			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 normally carve up the golden beaches of sunny @entity20 but made the trip to the @entity2 , where temperatures as low as just 2 - @entity23 , after hearing about the smooth waves			1
scroll down to see the video super cool : surfer @entity18 carves up an icy wave in the @entity2 , where the water temperature is as low as @entity30			1
he 's more used to the golden beaches of @entity20 do n't catch a cold ! mr @entity18 crouches in the barrel of one of the powerful waves			1
he 's wearing a thick wetsuit , hood , gloves and shoes to prevent pneumonia after putting his wetsuit on , surfer mr @entity16 , 26 , walked the ice - covered road to the beach through snow as high as his waist - all just to reach the water 's edge			1
they wear full wetsuits with shoes and hoods covering as much of their skin as possible			0
but mr @entity16 said that once the water hit his face it felt ' like fire '			2
they have to warm up before entering the water - and they contend with the risk of catching pneumonia			1
breathtaking : one of the surfers performs a grab after getting some air on one of the less threatening of the @entity2 waves			1
behind him the stunning scenery makes for an impressive picture golden sun rays light up the sky , but the temperatures in the water and air are still dangerously low			1
the men had to take extra precautions to prevent them from catching pneumonia mr @entity16 said : ' when the water hit any exposed skin it would burn like fire until your body temperature warmed up from paddling			1
only then could you get the mojo working			0
' the region is pretty cold i 'd imagine by any standard			0
the air was ranging from @entity30 to way lower depending on the day and wind chill			1
' winds were very strong through the valley and felt like they could cut you in half - it must have been minus degrees fairly often and the water was probably 2 - 3c			1
refreshing : a surfer rips up one of the waves beneath breathtaking backdrop of snow - covered mountains off the @entity14 , in @entity15 extreme : one of the brave surfers performs a turn after dropping in to one of the waves			1
they have to warm up before entering the water if they are to survive the conditions foam from the clear turquoise waters sprays around the surfer as he trails a hand through the swell			1
they have to walk across rocky shores to reach the remote waves it 's a bit fresh out there : the clean powerful swells are rarely surfed in winter , when most people consider the water too cold to venture in to ' it 's a really strange sensation entering water that cold			1
we 're wearing wetsuits between 5 - 7mm so the only parts that really feel the cold when you first enter is any exposed skin so mostly just your face			2
' i remember it felt like fire - an insane sensation and very uncomfortable			2
if you had to duck under consecutive waves you would get a crazy headache and it felt like my eye sockets were physically swelling to the point i thought they might swell my eyes shut			2
' i do n't think it 's too dangerous unless you do n't warm up			0
although pneumonia would be pretty easy to get if you do n't know what you 're doing and that can be serious			0
a rainbow appears through the mist of an @entity2 waterfall			0
right , a surfer runs back through the water , no doubt in a hurry for some warmer conditions beautiful : the temperatures in the water may be close to freezing , but the scenes of the @entity162 are simply stunning remote : the three surfers survey the waters			1
they had to walk through the ice - covered road to the beach and through snow as high as his waist - all just to reach the water 's edge ' overall it was an awesome challenge			1
we were there a week and a half and the weather spanned from full snow white - outs , to melting snow on the hills , then right as we were leaving we could barely drive from the house as a blizzard nearly snowed us in			2
' i 've been surfing relatively my whole life - i was always around the ocean and it has been a natural progression			0
' but this was extremely different from what we 're used to here in @entity20 , mainly just the harsh conditions but i loved it and every part of it			0
deadly power : clear blue skies can be seen above the @entity2 waves , which many people describe as ' unsurfable ' during the winter months skills : the surfer performs a frontside turn on the right - hand break			1
the men said the water was so cold they felt a ' burning sensation ' when it touched their exposed skin radical : the sportsman ducks inside the barrel of a smaller wave			0
in the distance the perilous rocks can be seen carving it up : a surfer performs a stunt on the chilly 6ft high wave			2
the conditions looked ' punishing ' said the photographer ' i 've never done anything like it before , in fact i think it had been almost 10 years since i had seen snow but i relished the experience and the challenges that surfing in the snow presented			2
' most surfers tackle the cool waves in spring - as the @entity227 emerges from its dark winter during the time the snow is melting and the ocean calms down			1
but @entity230 and the team went over during wild winter chaos most people would describe as unsurfable and conquered even the most powerful of waves			2
the trip was the brainchild of photographer @entity237 , 26 , who had an aching desire to go somewhere that would be freezing in the winter time should i go in ? the surfer , whose wetsuit is around 7mm thick in order to keep warm , looks out across the ocean as he studies how the waves are breaking holed up : @entity245 takes a rest from hitting the waves			2
in @entity20 he would probably lay on the golden sands , here he tries a spot of ice fishing chilling out : @entity18 rests in a hot tub with a can of beer after a tough day surfing icy @entity2 waves mr @entity17 wraps up warm in a red jacket and wooly hat as he looks out to sea			0
reaching the beach across the rocky shore was one of the biggest challenges he said : ' i 've seen it in the summer but in the winter it looked punishing			0
we wanted to see if it could be done and the weather was worse than we ever imagined			0
' it was so difficult with rain building up on my camera			0
i tried to go swimming but i could feel my vital organs shutting down and all my blood rushing to my heart to protect it			0
' i swam a couple of days but they were in the water every day			0
luckily they 're on their boards above the water most of the time but i think they might have started to get used to it			0
' i had to wear thinner gloves to handle the camera so it was almost unbearable			0
i would get back to the car and simply could n't move			0
it was a cool but brutal experience			0

water temperature as low as @entity30 and remotes beaches are covered in waist - high snow
surfers shun safer spring conditions and paddle out in perilous winter swells in search of bigger waves
