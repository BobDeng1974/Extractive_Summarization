legendary former @entity1 skipper @entity0 wants captains to halt abusive sledging and aggressive gestures at the @entity5			1
@entity7 ’s spat with @entity9 batsman @entity8 on sunday — when the @entity10 repeatedly screamed at @entity8 to ‘ speak @entity11 ’ — was the latest piece of boorish on - field behaviour and now @entity0 is calling on captains such as @entity1 ’s @entity15 to tell players to cut out the verbals			1
@entity0 wields considerable influence as chairman of the @entity21 ’s world cricket committee			1
and @entity23 president @entity22 , as well as @entity25 chief executive @entity24 , have agreed to put the idea on the agenda for the @entity21 meeting on january 28 - 29			2
@entity29 of @entity30 and @entity33 's @entity32 clash during a test match back in 1981 @entity35 ( right ) has a heated exchange with @entity37 during a @entity39 match in 2013 @entity7 and @entity8 exchange words during @entity30 's clash with @entity9 in @entity42 if the @entity21 agree , an edict could come in before the @entity5 starts in @entity42 on february 14 , when @entity1 meet @entity30			1
sin - bins are also being considered			1
@entity0 said : ‘ it comes down to respect , for the umpires , the opposition , the viewers and one ’s own team			1
i hate the sneering and mocking and the curled lip , as much as what is said , or what is done in terms of action			0
‘ this is a good time to remind people of the @entity59 , @entity61 motto , both because @entity63 ’s shocking death should make people rethink their values and because of the @entity5			1
the important thing is that people are consistent and , if given out , they leave the arena promptly and get on with the game quickly			0
’ the @entity21 are considering tougher sanctions and @entity22 said : ‘ the ceos plan to have @entity72 , the head of cricket , brief referees and umpires			0
they will be told zero tolerance for bad behaviour and it is their job to enforce that			2
’ @entity7 was unhappy after @entity9 took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off @entity8 's pads @entity85 cricket correspondent @entity84 was criticised by @entity30 players @entity87 and @entity88 for linking @entity63 ’s death with flashpoints in the recent @entity30 - @entity9 series			1
but seven players have been punished in the last month including @entity7 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
@entity84 said : ‘ i am not critical of @entity96 but the posturing and unnecessary gesturing appeared to be as bad as ever in the last series			0
‘ the @entity21 plan to bring in strict anti-sledging regulations in time for the @entity5 , but it is a shame the players have not felt prompted to act themselves			1
’ @entity104 , the former @entity1 skipper , said : ‘ asking the captains to hold fire is a good idea but we ’ll have to look at the small print			2
you have to find the balance between what is acceptable and what is n’t			0
’ @entity8 and @entity7 were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair certainly foul abuse on the field flies in the face of the @entity121 spirit that cricket is supposed to uphold			1
@entity30 captain @entity22 acknowledged as much when he made his heart - wrenching address at the funeral of @entity63			2
@entity22 said : ‘ his spirit , which is now part of the game for ever , will act as a custodian of the sport we all love			0
we must listen to it			0
we must learn from it			0
’ unfortunately , a cult has emerged in this most gentlemanly of sports			0
it gives bowlers licence to charge down the pitch , arms waving , before stopping a yard from the bemused batsman and shouting ‘ f * * * off ! ’ when @entity1 ’s @entity146 took the final wicket in his incredible haul of 19 for 90 against @entity30 at @entity149 in 1956 , he turned and took his sweater from the umpire , then walked off without histrionics			1
i used to write his column in the @entity155 and he explained : ‘ well , that ’s how we did it then			0
’ former @entity1 cricket captain @entity0 , picutred in 1981 , has called to stamp out sledging i ’ve played cricket with @entity22 , for the @entity161 which has 2,400 members who pass on the message of sportsmanship and fair play to schools			1
i suggested to him it might be a good idea to persuade the international captains , the boards , the @entity171 and the @entity23 to call a halt to abusive behaviour			2
they could call it the @entity176 or @entity177			0
@entity22 said my idea was ‘ firmly on the agenda at the next @entity21 meeting ’			0
he promises zero tolerance in the @entity5 but will it last ? @entity30 have always bred strong characters who love sports and hate losing			2
they love provoking the opposition , particularly the @entity11 , through word and action			0
@entity190 , the eminent @entity10 cricket writer , believes sledging has become more barbed as a result of the high stakes in the @entity194			2
@entity1 cricketer @entity195 ( right ) has been accused of sledging he said ‘ administrators and the media have an ambivalent relationship with on - field aggression			1
they affect to deplore it but in truth they know it sells			0
’ and , frankly , the @entity23 have been allowing their cricketers , @entity1 fast bowler @entity195 especially , to run amok			0
the @entity21 have 10 full members , 38 associate members and 57 affiliated countries , almost half of the world , and they expect a billion television viewers to watch the @entity5 final in @entity42 on march 29			2
how many of these will be turned off by watching what @entity84 calls ‘ the verbal abuse , the posturing and the unnecessary gesturing which appeared to be as bad as ever ( in the recent @entity30 - @entity9 series ) ’ ? one stroke — not a hook or a cut but a common sense consensus — could stop this nonsense in a trice			1
the laws say the captain is responsible for the behaviour of his players , so speak up @entity96 , @entity15 and the rest ! @entity228 was a sports writer for the @entity155 and @entity229 from 1960 to 2000 .			0

@entity10 @entity7 ’s spat with @entity9 batsman @entity8 on sunday was the latest piece of boorish on - field behaviour
@entity0 has called for @entity5 captains to stamp out verbals
sin - bins are being considered as possible punishment if problem persists
