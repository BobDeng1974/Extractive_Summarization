by @entity0 a mother was so mortified when her eldest son called her a ' jelly belly ' that she dropped five dress sizes in five months			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , weighed 16st and wore size 18 clothes when her son @entity10 , now 7 , made the innocent remark , which prompted her to join a gym and slim down to the 10st 10lb she is today			1
miss @entity5 , 28 , said : ' @entity10 did n’t mean any harm			1
he was only joking around , in the way that children do			0
if i ’d burst into tears he would have felt bad , but i laughed it off			0
it was the kick i needed to make the change			2
' miss @entity5 , also mother to @entity33 , four , and @entity34 , two , began gaining weight as she fell into the routine of motherhood			1
she said : ' when i was pregnant i would eat for two , even though i did n’t really need to			2
being pregnant was a bit of an excuse			2
after i had @entity34 it was really difficult to shift			0
@entity5 decided to tackle her weight after her eldest son made an innocent comment about the size of her stomach ' i ’d never been overweight when i was younger , but when you have children , things change			1
i found myself staying up late after the kids went to bed , when it was easier to order a takeaway or cook something from the freezer			0
' miss @entity5 , a former saleswoman , found much of her excess weight collecting on her waistline , leading to an unsightly bulge around her stomach area			1
in the winter of 2013 , miss @entity5 was lying on the sofa where her sons @entity10 and @entity33 rushed in , in a playful mood			1
she said : ' @entity10 pushed my tummy and said , " mummy ’s got a jelly belly ! " ' if i ’d heard him say it to anyone else , i would have told him he was being rude , but i could n’t bring myself to tell him off			1
he was only being silly , and being honest			0
' ( left : @entity5 's stomach when she was at her heaviest weight , right : her stomach now ) in november that year , miss @entity5 attended the wedding of the sister of her partner , @entity73 , 31 , a car bodyworker			1
she said : ' when the official photos came back i was horrified because i looked so overweight			0
the unposed photos which appeared on @entity77 later were even worse			0
it was the final straw			0
' miss @entity5 joined @entity79 on january 2nd this year and cut all the takeaways out of her daily diet			1
she said : ' i ’ve built a routine where i can go out for one night on the weekend when i can enjoy life and eat what i like			2
then in the week , it ’s straight back on the diet			1
it ’s worked really well for me			0
@entity5 at a wedding -- the picture which was the final straw which persuaded her to lose weight			1
at the front is @entity10 , with his brother @entity33 beside him , and @entity34 above ' i started going to the gym every morning at 6.30am			2
to start with i could n’t run for 30 seconds at time , but now i run five kilometres each time i go on the treadmill			0
' @entity5 now also goes to the gym nearly everyday miss @entity5 ’s routine meant she shrank five dress sizes in five months , today weighing a slim 10st 10lb and wearing size 8 clothes			1
before beginning her weight loss regime , miss @entity5 ate nothing for breakfast , followed by a chicken tikka baguette with cheese and onion crisps for lunch , then breaded chicken with chips and beans for her evening meal			1
her favourite snack was a bag of @entity114 , with a dollop of mayonnaise and grated cheddar cheese on top			1
today , she has yoghurt with fruit for breakfast , followed by chicken salad for lunch and home - made shepherds pie for evening meal			2

she said : ' i recently went to the bingo with my friends , where i saw my grandad			0
i waved at him , but he did n’t recognise me			0
he looked at me as if i was a complete stranger			0
he said i was a bit too thin when he realised who i was			0
' i love the changes i ’ve made			2
i ’m so much more energised			0
when i think back to time when i could only run for 30 seconds at a time , i can hardly believe how far i ’ve come			0
' i ’m grateful to @entity10 for making that cheeky comment			2
coming from someone so innocent and honest , it was ultimately quite helpful			0

after birth of third son her weight continued to rise *due* to poor diet
her favorite snack used to be @entity114 with mayonnaise and cheese
her son @entity10 made an innocent remark when *poking* her stomach
prompted her to change her diet , *ditching* the high *fat* foods
also began working out daily , allowing herself one night off a week
