the moment the sun dips below the horizon - a sunset - is a phenomena known to all on @entity6 , accompanied by fantastic colours and a transition from day to night			1
but a lesser known phenomenon has been captured by astronauts on the @entity11 , showing the moment of a moonset - when our largest natural satellite dips below the horizon			1
and remarkable ‘ squashing ’ effect , not always easily visible to observers on @entity6 , are also made apparent in the images			0
a video from @entity23 's @entity22 from @entity24 shows the effect in action			1
it occurs when the moon begins to dip below the horizon and the light must travel through the atmosphere and is refracted the latest pictures were taken by @entity23 astronauts @entity34 and @entity22 on the @entity11 in a @entity35 showing the moon setting , mr @entity22 said : ‘ @entity38 behind @entity6 ’s atmosphere appears to land on a soft pillow of clouds			1
’ the moon ’s appearance as a squashed orb is actually caused by refracting light , similar to the apparent bending of a pencil placed into a glass of water			0
light passing from the vacuum of space through the air of @entity6 's atmosphere can get a bit bent , causing the effect			1
depending on how much of the atmosphere has to go through - or how low the moon is through the horizon - the more squashed it will appear			2
this is because light from different parts of the moon reach the observer 's eye at different speeds , so it does n't look normal			0
the amazing video shows the moon slowly passing down through @entity6 ’s atmosphere as the @entity11 makes its way around our planet			1
in the images an odd ‘ squashing ’ effect can be seen as the moon makes its way down			0
when the @entity11 passed this moonrise , the light from the top part of the moon was moving through less air than that at the bottom - which is being viewed through @entity6 's atmosphere - causing the lower light to bend			1
according to astronomer @entity84 , who works with the @entity85 in the @entity86 , this is due to an effect known as atmospherics			0
‘ light passing through our atmosphere as seen from a vantage point on the @entity11 will be refracted ; the amount of refraction is dependent on the airmass it passes through , ’ he told @entity89			2
‘ the moon being a relatively ( as seen by the eye ) large object across , the amount of refraction varies from top to bottom , causing the squashed effect			2
' the moon also turns slightly red ( seen here ) because the amount of refraction causes only particular wavelengths of light to be visible , in this case red , a similar effect to sunrise and sunset he said you could ‘ very tentatively ’ liken the effect to a star appearing bent if you look at it in a glass of water			0
astronomer @entity122 also said the effect can actually be noticed from @entity6 in particular instances			0
‘ if you photograph moonrise and moonset , as i have done on many occasions , you ’ll see the same effect - the moon looking like a slightly flattened orange , ’ he said			0
from the moon looking at @entity6 ( picture from apollo 8 in december 1978 shown ) , no such ' squashing ' effect is visible because the moon has no atmosphere			2

astronauts on the @entity11 have captured the *illusion* of our moon being ' squashed ' in space
a video from @entity23 's @entity22 shows the effect that occurs when the moon begins to dip below the horizon
when @entity11 passed this moonrise , the light from the top part of the moon was moving through less air than that at the bottom - which is being viewed through @entity6 's atmosphere - causing the lower light to bend and ' squash ' the moon
