her striking features have graced countless top fashion magazines and @entity4 ’s great catwalks			1
yet despite also being voted @entity7 ’s @entity6 recently , @entity5 has divided opinion over whether her supermodel looks are always picture perfect			1
in fact , images of the 21 - year - old sporting a skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer ’s catalogue after advertising watchdogs ruled miss @entity5 looked too thin			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) says the pictures on the website of @entity20 were ' socially irresponsible ' and told it to remove them			2
' too thin ' : images of model @entity5 sporting this skimpy bikini have been banned from an online clothing retailer 's catalogue by advertising watchdogs the @entity17 acted after receiving a complaint which claimed the model ' looked anorexic ' in one image of her wearing a watermelon - motif bikini and another where she sports cut - off denim shorts on the @entity34 - based company ’s site			1
the ban comes just weeks after miss @entity5 , of @entity36 , @entity37 , won the title of @entity7 ’s most stylish woman at the @entity40 in @entity41			1
last night , @entity20 , which is owned by the family of miss @entity5 ’s rock musician ex-boyfriend @entity43 , confirmed it had removed the offending pictures from its site			1
however , the company defended the model insisting that she does not have an eating disorder and had modelled successfully for the firm for three years			2
@entity43 ’s mother , @entity51 , who also works for the firm , which has a shop in @entity54 , said the pictures were ' representative of young people ' and pointed out that the costume miss @entity5 is pictured wearing was a size 8			1
she said : ' @entity5 certainly is slim , i ’m not disputing that			1
' she was my son ’s former girlfriend and has been a family friend for three years and had modelled for us for three years			2
we have never had any complaints			2
' i know her , she ’s not anorexic or unhealthy and eats a very good diet			2
she ’s just a naturally thin person			2
ruling : the @entity17 acted after receiving a complaint claiming the model ( left ) ' looked anorexic ' in the campaign miss @entity5 , pictured second from right at the @entity71 , was recently voted @entity7 's most stylish woman at the @entity73 ' do i think people should aspire to be like her ? yes , because she is a beautiful person and jets around the world earning £ 600 - plus a day			1
she ’s got a successful career and no mental health problems			2
' do i think removing a picture of @entity5 will stop people being mentally ill ? no , i do n’t , but i accept the decision and so does @entity5			1
' the spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career , which saw miss @entity5 plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15 - year - old by a talent spotter at @entity41 ’s @entity88			1
the former @entity90 pupil was quickly snapped up by top modelling agency storm , which launched @entity93 ’s career , after she was runner - up in the @entity96 2004 competition			0
since then , she has gone on to feature on the cover of @entity99 and @entity100 fashion magazines , modelled for @entity101 in the @entity103 fashion capital @entity104 , and completed a photo - shoot for @entity106 , wearing @entity107 and @entity108			0
she has also appeared at @entity54 and @entity109 and will be the face of @entity113 ’s @entity112 campaign			0
shooting star : the spat is the first black mark on an otherwise flawless career , which saw miss @entity5 plucked from obscurity as a gawky 15 - year - old by a talent spotter at @entity41 's @entity88 according to her online profile , she is 5ft 10ins with a 24 - inch waist - 10in smaller than the average @entity123 woman and just an inch bigger than that of @entity126 , who has sparked health fears because her 23 - inch waist is the size of a typical seven - year - old child ’s			1
the @entity17 ’s ruling said : ' the @entity17 considered the model was very slim			0
we also noted that in the bikini and denim shorts images , hollows in her thighs were noticeable and she had prominent thigh bones			0
' we considered that in combination with the stretched out pose and heavy eye make - up , the model looked underweight in the pictures			0
' while we considered the bikini and denim short images might not cause widespread or serious offence , we concluded they were socially irresponsible			0
' early in her career , the raven - haired beauty reflected on how her life had changed so dramatically from being teased by classmates about her height to becoming one of @entity4 's most sought - after models			1
she said : ' i was a goth at school and did n't really hang around with all the popular kids			0
' they used to shout things at me and called me ugly but i did n't let it bother me			0
i still find it hard to believe that people think that i can now be a model			0
' i think it shows you can just be yourself and have an individual look			0
everyone does n't have to be the same			0
i just hope i can continue to be successful because modelling has given me the chance to travel and experience new places and i want to continue to do that			0
' miss @entity5 is currently represented by @entity54 - based @entity179 and @entity41 ’s colours agency			1
both declined to comment .			0
