he was arguably @entity5 's third choice striker at the beginning of the season , but @entity9 's clinical finishing has taken the club to within a point of returning the @entity13 title to the @entity14			1
the @entity16 international scored an opening brace during @entity5 's resounding 4 - 0 victory over @entity20 in their penultimate game of the season - leaving them needing only a draw against @entity23 to be crowned champions			1
@entity9 's two goals took his tally for the season to 26 in all competitions ( 16 league goals ) - not a bad return for a player who has frequently been linked with a move and bristles at the term of ' super-sub '			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity35 on the title clinical : @entity9 's brace in @entity5 's 4 - 0 win against @entity20 takes them to within a point of the title invisible man ? @entity9 's heat map is not that impressive , but it 's finding the right space that sets him apart the 28 - year - old can appear almost invisible during games , especially when teams employ the sort of defensive spoiling tactics that @entity20 used to strangle the first - half			1
in fact , @entity9 's heat map for his entire game does n't assume greatness - but it is the 6ft 4in striker 's ability to be in the right place at the right time and clinical finishing that sets him apart			0
he only managed two shots on target during the entire game ... but scored with both			0
predator : @entity9 opened the scoring with a close range finish from @entity66 's cross wait for it : @entity9 's first goal produced a precise finish from @entity71 patient probing down the right at the double ; @entity9 reacts fastest to @entity74 's rebounded shot to give @entity5 a controlling 2 - 0 lead goal poacher : @entity9 was at hand to convert @entity74 's rebounded shot from close range will @entity5 win the @entity13 ? @entity9 could have opened the scoring earlier when a lofted ball from @entity83 sent him into acres of space with only the keeper to beat , but he failed to take the ball down as exquisitely as perhaps the absent @entity87 might			1
nonetheless , @entity9 's attributes come alive in the six yard box and that is where both of his goals were netted from - with both coming from crosses made by the formidable @entity66			2
the @entity94 deserves praise for his relentless running that gave his team an attacking outlet throughout the game without ignoring his defensive responsibilities on the rare occasion that @entity20 moved out of their own half			0
@entity104 bargy : @entity66 was a constant threat down the right , setting up both of @entity9 's goals right on time : @entity66 patrolled his flank with absolute authority , spending more time in @entity20 's half for the first goal , @entity5 patiently probed before @entity112 played in @entity114 on the right and his squared cross left @entity9 with a simple finish from close range to break the deadlock on 64minutes			1
the second came only eight minutes later and started with the same link up play between @entity112 and @entity66 before ending with @entity9 reacting quickest to @entity74 's deflected shot - again only inches from the goal line			0
as well as @entity9 and @entity66 , @entity5 's other outstanding performer was , typically , @entity83			1
the @entity127 midfielder is the league 's ultimate all - rounder			0
no other player can combine the athleticism of his surging runs from midfield with the delicacy of his passing and power of his shooting - while he also takes a mean free - kick			0
100 not out ! @entity83 finished the game in style with a surging run and his 20th goal of the season action man : @entity83 's heat map shows him to be the @entity13 's ultimate all rounder eventually , there may even be a position named after him in the same way that @entity150 became a byword for holding midfielder			0
the game 's final goal perhaps epitomises @entity83 's strength , seizing the ball from midfield before leaving defenders in his wake to slot home his 20th goal of the season and , incredibly , the team 's 100th league goal			1
come sunday , @entity9 will have a last opportunity to add to that total , pick up a second @entity13 winner 's medal ... and no doubt raise himself in the perceived pecking order at @entity5 next season			2
stat attack : the numbers show @entity9 's clinical finishing from few chances an @entity83 's all - round excellence			2

@entity5 beat @entity20 4 - 0 to close in on the @entity13 title
@entity9 had two shots on target ... and scored with both of them
@entity66 was a constant threat and was involved in @entity9 's goals
@entity83 was typically outstanding - scoring @entity5 's 100th league goal
