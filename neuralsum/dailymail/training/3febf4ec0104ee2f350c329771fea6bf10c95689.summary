the broadside came from @entity1 , commander of the task force sent to reclaim the islands in the @entity15 30 years ago next month			1
he said the @entity4 was in a ' dire ' state following defence cuts which has left the service without an aircraft carrier before 2020			1
he told the @entity19 : ' we could not retake the @entity9			1
if we had been in this state in 1982 the @entity9 would be the @entity9			1
' rear - admiral sir @entity23 - who is known as @entity1 - compared the @entity4 to the @entity24 - the country does not have one - and said the role of a navy was to be able to go a long way from home			1
he said : ' the best we can do for an expeditionary force is a day trip to @entity32 '			1
it is not the first time a senior member of the military has attacked defence cuts and raised concerns about the @entity9			1
former @entity39 has called for foreign aid cash to be diverted to defence after also warning @entity42 could not win a new @entity43			1
and , major general @entity44 who commanded the brigade of @entity46 during the conflict , said the islands have been left vulnerable by the cuts , and it would be ' end of story ' if @entity10 forces took the @entity42 base on @entity54			1
he told @entity55 earlier this month : ' the @entity10 have a marine brigade			1
they 've got a parachute brigade and some good special forces			2
' ' all they 've got to do is get those guys on to the islands for long enough to destroy the ( @entity64 ) @entity63 jets and that 's the end of it			2
' @entity1 said the @entity4 was in a ' dire ' state following defence cuts which has left it without an aircraft carrier before 2020			1
@entity70 , the island 's capital is pictured former @entity39 has called for foreign aid cash to be diverted to defence after also warning @entity42 could not win a new @entity43 lord @entity74 says the government was mad to cut the number of frigates and destroyers to 19 , just one more than the 18 sunk or damaged in the 1982 conflict			2
he believes small cuts in the aid , health or welfare budgets would make a disproportionate difference to defence and would enable @entity42 to restore its naval strength			2
lord @entity74 , then commander @entity74 , was skipper of @entity87 when she was sunk during the @entity9 campaign			2
the conflict claimed the lives of 255 @entity42 and 649 @entity10 servicemen			2
the former @entity94 minister believes the lessons of that war are being forgotten in the current @entity97 ( @entity97 )			2
diplomatic tension : relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 @entity9 conflict in an interview with the @entity106 - based @entity105 he said : ' there are things which our nation thinks its forces can do , but they can no longer do them			0
ever since 1945 we have been cutting and cutting			0
' i am horrified our naval flotilla now comprises only 19 frigates and destroyers			0
major general @entity44 said the islands have been left vulnerable by defence cuts ' in the @entity9 , in the first month of fighting , we had four sunk and 14 damaged			0
we seem to have forgotten that when you fight you lose things			0
' here we are with 19 frigates and destroyers			0
are they bonkers ? are they mad ? how have they allowed this to happen ? ' today , because we do n't have the carriers with fixed wing aircraft , we could not retake the @entity9 , without our maritime we could not possibly have done it			0
' i believe defence should get a better crack of the whip among @entity137 departments			0
it seems to me a tiny fraction of the aid budget , the welfare budget and of the @entity143 , so tiny it would hardly affect them , would make an immense difference to defence			0
' yes there will be howls			0
we wo n't be able to give the @entity149 some aid so they wo n't be able to build their aircraft carriers			0
' we wo n't be able to find something in health or in welfare			0
that always causes howls and squeals but the amounts we are talking about are tiny			0

@entity1 says the @entity4 is as much use as a @entity24
