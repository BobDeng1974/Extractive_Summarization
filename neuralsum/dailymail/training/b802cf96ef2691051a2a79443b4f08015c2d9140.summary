by @entity0 published : 10:52 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 03:24 est , 12 june 2013 a @entity2 spacecraft has blasted off today on a 15 - day mission to an experimental space lab in the latest step towards the development of a space station			1
the @entity9 spacecraft was launched from a remote site in the @entity12 desert in @entity2 's far west at 5.38pm ( 9.38am ) under warm , clear blue skies , in images carried live on state television			1
once in orbit , the craft will dock with the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) 1 , a trial space laboratory module , and the two male and one female astronauts will carry out various experiments and test the module 's systems			0
@entity2 successfully carried out its first manned docking exercise with @entity18 1 last june , a milestone in an effort to acquire the technological and logistical skills to run a full space station that can house people for long periods			0
president @entity54 oversaw the launch personally , addressing the astronauts before they blasted off to wish them success , saying he was ' enormously happy ' to be there			2
' you are the pride of the @entity2 people , and this mission is both glorious and sacred , ' @entity54 said , according to state media			1
this mission will be the longest time @entity2 astronauts have spent in space , and marks the second mission for lead astronaut @entity69			0
it is @entity2 's fifth manned space mission since 2003 , and was accompanied by the usual outpouring of national pride and @entity37 propaganda , including children dressed as happy ethnic minorities waving off the three at the space centre			1
the shenzhou 10 capsule carrying three astronauts lifted off on a 15 - day mission to dock with a space lab and to educate young people about science this mission will be the longest time @entity2 astronauts have spent in space , and marks the second mission for lead astronaut @entity69 the @entity9 mission will be the latest show of @entity2 's growing prowess in space however , some wondered why @entity2 was spending so much money exploring space when it was still a developing country with a plethora of more pressing issues , from food safety and pollution to the prevalence of workplace fire disasters			1
' why do n't they spend this money solving @entity2 's real problems instead of wasting it like this ? ' wrote one user on @entity2 's popular @entity102 - like service , @entity101			0
@entity2 's space programme has come a long way since late leader @entity105 , founder of @entity2 in 1949 , lamented that the country could not even launch a potato into space			2
the three astronauts of the @entity110 - 10 manned spacecraft mission , @entity69 ( c ) , @entity111 ( r ) and @entity112 before blast off but @entity2 is still far from catching up with the established space superpowers , the @entity115 and @entity116			1
rendezvous and docking techniques such as those which @entity2 is only testing now were mastered by the @entity115 and the @entity121 decades ago , and the 10.5 metre - long @entity18 1 is a trial module , not a fully fledged space station			0
still , the @entity9 mission will be the latest show of @entity2 's growing prowess in space and comes while budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back @entity115 manned space launches			1
@entity2 also plans an unmanned moon landing and deployment of a moon rover			0
scientists have raised the possibility of sending a man to the moon , but not before 2020			0
while @entity139 insists its space programme is for peaceful purposes , a @entity138 report last month highlighted @entity2 's increasing space capabilities and said @entity139 was pursuing a variety of activities aimed at preventing its adversaries from using space - based assets during a crisis			2
fears of a space arms race with the @entity115 and other powers mounted after @entity2 blew up one of its own weather satellites with a ground - based missile in january 2007 .			0

it is @entity2 's fifth manned space mission since 2003
the @entity110 10 spacecraft will dock with experimental space lab
@entity2 's president @entity54 called the mission ' sacred '
