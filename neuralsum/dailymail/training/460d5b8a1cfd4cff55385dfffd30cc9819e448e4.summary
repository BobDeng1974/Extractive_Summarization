unusual pancake shaped ice formations that are more typically seen in @entity2 and @entity4 sea ice have been found floating on a river in @entity6			2
the dinner plate - sized ice ' pancakes ' have formed on a quiet stretch of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the strange formations were photographed at the @entity14 , @entity15 , near @entity16 , by @entity17 , a biologist for the @entity18			0
the dinner plate - sized ice pancakes were found in an area known as the @entity14 on the @entity11			1
normally pancake form on ocean water or lakes around the @entity24 where the movement of water keeps the ice from forming a flat sheet the pancakes are thought to have formed from foam created by faster flowing water further upstream , accumulating in a corner of a pool			1
freezing temperatures last week caused the foam to freeze , and the current bashed them into a circular shape			2

pancake ice normally forms in rough seas around the @entity2 and @entity4 , but can form in some lakes and rivers			1
tiny needle like crystals called frazil crystals rise to the surface and accumulate together			0
in calm water these typically form a greasy film that freezes into a flat surface ice			2
however , in rough or choppy water , these crystals congeal together into slushy circular disks			1
as these disks bump into each other and are buffeted by the water , they develop ridges and raised edges , giving them a distinctive dinner plate appearance			1
in the polar seas these can sometime have a thickness of up to 3.9 inches and diameter of between 12 inches to nine feet			0
eventually the plates fuse together to form consolidated sea ice that can have ridges that are up to 60 feet thick			0
however , they do ooccasionally occur on rivers when temperatures drop low enough			0
officials at the @entity78 said it is the first time they have seen pancake ice form on the river			1
mr @entity17 said : ' i ’ve actually seen them before at the @entity84 in @entity85 a couple of winters ago , but they were much smaller - more the size of a saucer			0
' it ’s the first time we ’ve seen them at the @entity11			0
they are quite a rare occurrence , the conditions have to be right for them to occur			0
' i ’ve spoken to a number of people across the catchment , the people on the river , such as the ghillies and anglers , who have never seen them here before			0
' i do n’t know if it ’s because we ’ve had more extreme winters over the last couple of years , and then that hard frost			0
' in the @entity2 and @entity4 , pancake ice usually forms in rough seas , which prevent tiny crystals of ice , known as frazil crystals , that rise to the surface from bonding together			1
instead , the needle - like crystals accumulate into slushy circular disks			1
the edges around the perimetre of each disk becomes raised as the pancakes bump into each other from the movement of the ocean waves			0
the ice pancakes were around an inch thick and the size of a dinner plate on the @entity11 in @entity12			1
in the @entity2 and @entity4 , pancake ice usually forms in rough seas , which prevent tiny crystals of ice , known as frazil crystals , that rise to the surface from bonding together the pancakes accumulated downstream of faster water that is thought to have created foam , that then froze			1
it is thought that particularly hard frosts last week helped to cause the disks to form , but experts are baffled as to why they have not been seen on the river before in previous years the strange formations were photographed at the @entity14 , @entity15 , near @entity16 ( marked ) , by @entity17 , a biologist for the @entity18 in the @entity2 , these can bond together to form ridges that pile on top of each other and reach up to 60ft ( 18 metres ) thick in places			1

@entity153 , a spokesman for the @entity18 , said : ' we think foam floating about on the water started to freeze , probably at night			0
' bits of frozen foam got pushed around in the eddy , and in the ensuing collisions , became roughly circular			2
' perhaps each disc grew when smaller pieces of unfrozen foam struck the disc , adhered and then froze in place			0

bits of frozen foam got pushed around in the eddy , and in the ensuing collisions , became roughly circular ' pancake ice in @entity4 's @entity172 can form plates that are between a foot ( 12 - inches ) and nine feet ( 108 inches ) in diameter			1

biologists photographed the dinner plate - sized circles of ice on a quiet pool of the @entity11 in @entity12 after heavy frosts
slushy ice , said to be made of frozen foam , accumulated to form ' pancakes '
pancake ice normally forms during rough seas within the polar circles
swirling river currents are thought to have bashed slush together to form circular disks that then froze *overnight* as temperatures dropped
