can @entity0 sue for restraint of trade ? @entity3 has killed off @entity0 's career and you 've got to feel sorry for the player			1
you ca n't blame him for joining @entity8 – why would he turn that down ? at the time he was a confident striker – playing regularly in the @entity10 and scoring goals for @entity12			1
he 'd just been to a @entity13			0
@entity0 has scarcely been given a chance since joining @entity8 despite their striking problems @entity3 ' decision to ignore @entity0 , in favour of @entity18 , is completely illogical this time last year @entity0 was about to play at a @entity13 for @entity20 but his stock has fallen since for @entity3 to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical			1
i 'm well aware @entity0 is n't @entity25 , i know he 's not a world - class striker			1
@entity0 missed out on saturday at @entity28 because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see @entity18 get yet another chance			2
the @entity20 striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season , made 31 starts , and unlike any @entity8 player in the scoring charts this season , easily got into double figures			0
contrast that with this campaign when in terms of @entity10 minutes on the pitch @entity0 has played the equivalent of roughly six - and - a - half games			2
@entity0 has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football when he has started in the @entity10 or @entity47 , @entity0 and @entity8 have impressed on his first @entity10 start for @entity8 he scored , and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game , @entity8 won the next two , and drew the fourth			1
and then he was dropped again and has n't started since			0
meanwhile , @entity18 regularly gets more time on the pitch , and regularly fails to deliver			0
he has to go down as @entity8 's worst - ever signing – at least the club won a trophy when @entity54 was at @entity55			1
how come @entity18 got more time on the pitch at @entity57 last weekend than @entity0 ? and what about saturday ? @entity18 was hopeless yet again			2
whether you watch his performance or check the stats , he was useless – not for the first time this season			0
ultimately it 'd be wrong to suggest @entity0 was going to be the man to spearhead @entity8 's charge to the title and a @entity47 challenge			1
but to be so underused in a season when @entity70 has been missing for so long , and @entity18 has been ineffective , is inexplicable			0
@entity18 , no matter which way you look at it , has been useless , and @entity0 should be picked ahead of him @entity18 was given more time on the pitch than @entity0 in @entity8 's @entity75 semi-final defeat by @entity78 @entity0 scored 20 goals for @entity12 - he may not be world class , but he is better than the alternatives @entity0 should have joined @entity78 in january			1
but he found out about the move just a few hours before the transfer window closed and chose to stay			0
@entity3 told @entity0 that he did n't want him to go			2
why say that and then not bother using him ? nobody can ever take away the fact that @entity0 has scored for his boyhood club @entity8 in the @entity10 and the @entity47			0
and @entity0 is the kind of guy who will treasure those special moments and keep them close to his heart			0
but he 's lost his @entity20 place and his reputation as a @entity10 striker has been seriously undermined by @entity3 and @entity8 this season .			2

@entity0 has barely played since joining from @entity12
@entity3 ' decision to continue with @entity18 is illogical
@entity18 has to go down as @entity8 's worst - ever signing
@entity0 may not be world class but he deserves better than this
