a man with a 17 - hour erection had to have three pints of drained from his penis to relieve the problem			1
@entity4 , 23 , described the situation as ' pure agony ' and said he could only watch in horror as a doctor stabbed a cannula into the side of his manhood			1
he was diagnosed with a condition known as priapism - caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis			1
doctors told him they would have to draw off blood to reduce the pressure			2
' they were injecting me with adrenalin - and had to do it 24 times			2
' doctors had warned that if the injections failed to work , they would have to operate			1
the incident occurred last week after he spent the drinking heavily before sleeping with a female friend - and not taking @entity42 , he insists			1
' i got home went to sleep for a bit , ' he told @entity45			0
' i woke up at 9am and it was there , but lots of guys have that in the morning			2
' but by midday , the began to get concerned			0
' it started to get really sore , and i looked on the internet to see what it could be			0
' i tried putting an ice pack on it , sitting in a bath with some ice and even went for a run around the block with it tucked into my belt			0
' while he could urinate , he admits it was quite difficult			0
by late afternoon , the pain was unbearable and he got his house mate to drive him to hospital			0
' at first , he was in hysterics , but then realised how serious it was , ' he said			0
priapism usually affects men but in rare cases , can affect women too			0
the condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood , causing a painful , long - lasting erection			1
it is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis			1
also , a number of medications can sometimes disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection by widening the arteries in the penis			2
the nerves essentially ‘ forget ’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal have passed , leading to priapism			0
those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants , erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs			2
' i was in so much pain when i arrived at the desk that i ca n't remember exactly what i said - but i made the staff laugh , ' he recalled			2
two hours later , a urologist arrived from another hospital to treat him			0
' he warned me he would have to draw the blood out by stabbing the side of my penis with a cannula			2
' at that point i thought " just hurry up " - it really , really , really , really hurt			0
' the doctor drained two pints of blood - and the remainder was left to drip out onto an absorbent pad			1
' i think in total there was about three - and - a - half pints that came out , ' said mr @entity4			1
' the urologist said he had never seen anything like it			0
' even after the blood had been drained , the erection remained			1
it was only at 2am that the problem subsided - after 24 injections			1
such was the extent of his blood loss and the effect on his blood pressure of the adrenalin injections , mr @entity4 had to spend friday to monday in hospital			1
fortunately , he has been reassured there will be no long - term damage			0
but doctors ca n't rule out the problem occurring again			2
' i 'm not worried about it , though , ' said mr @entity4			2
' the girls will love it			0
' due to the amount of blood he lost , and the effect of the adrenaline shots on his body , mr @entity4 had to stay in hospital for three nights priapism usually affects men but in rare cases , can affect women too			1
