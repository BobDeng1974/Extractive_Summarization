to be in @entity0 these last few days as @entity1 prepare for the first one - day international against @entity2 on tuesday has been to marvel at a group of men who seem to be telling each other that the sky ’s the limit			1
at least that ’s what they keep implying in public			2
in private , they may be rocking back and forth , muttering darkly about seven - match one - day series and six - week @entity14			1
but , for the consumption of their supporters , @entity1 ’s 50 - over side is saying all the right things			1
honestly , you ’d have to be a curmudgeon not to give them full marks			2
@entity27 drives one through the covers during @entity1 's net session in @entity0 on monday for more musings on @entity1 ’s tour of @entity2 and other matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity34 @ the_topspin			1
both this tour and the tri-series in @entity37 ahead of the @entity38 will tell us whether @entity1 can turn theory into practice – and even whether they really believe they can			1
years of building a platform for the first 35 overs can take its toll			2
it ’s back - breaking work , and does n’t always come off			1
occasionally , you ’re left with a solid enough structure			2
but the flourishes – the loft conversion , the solar - panelled roof , the stained - glass conservatory – feel like a luxury			1
they ’re for @entity54 and @entity55			2
even amid the clarion calls from batting coach @entity58 , and the enthusiastic words of support from the top order , a sense remains that @entity1 do n’t quite dare go for it			1
last week , coach @entity63 explained why totals of 300 were – to sum up crudely – over-rated			2
it depends on the surface , he said			2
and in @entity71 – co-hosts of the @entity38 and venue for three of @entity1 ’s six group games – it is a rarity			1
if par is 270 , said @entity63 , and you make 290 , you are doing your job			2
there is some logic in this			2
@entity78 ( right ) plays an audacious reverse sweep shot while being watched by @entity80 yet take a look at @entity71 ’s one - day series at home to @entity84 at the start of the year			1
@entity71 ’s totals were 292 for seven , 271 for seven , 314 ( match tied ) , 280 for three ( batting second ) , and 303 for five			2
there were runs aplenty , and @entity1 need to be in the right frame of mind to seek them out			1
the omission from friday ’s warm - up game of @entity94 felt too clever by half			1
few top orders around the world would dare to leave out a player capable of scoring 116 not out off 64 balls , as @entity94 did against @entity2 at the @entity100 in march			1
@entity1 believe he was exposed by @entity84 ’s bowlers in the one - dayers at the end of the summer , and are concerned about his ability against spin			1
if this were the criteria for selection , the entire top six would struggle to get a game			2
@entity113 dances down the track and smacks one straight down the ground as @entity116 ( right ) watches @entity117 ’s six - fours - in - an - over heroics on against @entity119 felt like the perfect riposte , but attitudes do not change overnight			1
besides , @entity117 ’s inclusion is not the problem : he ’s bowling well , and @entity1 need some proper overs from their top six			1
the problem is an apparently widespread belief that a strike - rate of 80 from the top order will win you games			1
it is if you want to score 240 in 50 overs			0
but few sides do these days			0
recently , @entity134 made 264 all by himself			0
to expect things to change now , only a couple of months away from the @entity38 , is to be reminded of the last five @entity14			1
each time , @entity1 arrived unsure of their strongest team			1
each time , they failed to get beyond the first meaningful hurdle			0
@entity94 , who was left out against @entity119 , plays a more conventional sweep shot the suspicion remains that other countries treat 50 - over games like extended @entity100 matches , while @entity1 are more inclined to view them as shortened @entity145			1
four successive one - day series defeats under @entity147 – the only victory , in the @entity149 , came when @entity150 was captain – suggests the approach needs some work			1
monday afternoon ’s session of power - hitting at the @entity155 felt more like it			1
for @entity1 , it may well be alright on the night			1
they may even stun @entity2 , assuming the rain goes away			0
but hope and expectation converge less often than cricketers would like			0
@entity162 eyeing the future @entity1 assistant coach @entity164 wearing the @entity165 during training in @entity0 @entity1 ’s assistant coach @entity164 took to the nets at @entity0 ’s @entity169 on monday sporting a @entity165 ( right ) , an @entity171 ( optical head - mounted display , as if you did n’t know ) which among other things allows users to film what ’s going on in front of them without the bother of brandishing an @entity177			1
the back - room staff will use the footage to decide whether the @entity165 can add to the array gizmos already at their disposal			1
one possibility is that will allow batsmen to determine how closely they really watch the ball			0
the technology was used earlier in the year by @entity2 , when @entity164 was their coach			0
and it yielded a curious finding			0
when @entity190 wore it to bowl during net sessions , the @entity171 showed that , during his delivery stride , he looks at the batsman for only a split second			0
as @entity164 put it : ‘ it ’s impressive enough that he manages to bowl such a good line with the arm coming round at that angle			0
but to do it without looking at the batsman is just amazing			0
’ @entity147 ’s literary tastes it was surprising to see @entity147 poolside at @entity0 ’s @entity207 hotel reading the book they ’ve all been talking about			1
you know the one : temperamental star does it his way , upsetting people en route and staring out from the cover like some misunderstood genius			0
we can only hope he enjoyed @entity221 : the second half as much as the critics			1
@entity225 ’s advice for @entity226 a trip to the home of @entity225 at the weekend yielded some surprisingly trenchant views on @entity226 ’s love of social media			0
the gospel according to @entity225 is quite simple : ‘ do n’t text , do n’t tweet , do n’t use @entity233			0
the public does n’t need to know what you do and what you eat			0
‘ if you want to put your opinion about anything , have a press conference			0
just leave it and enjoy your cricket			0
why are you playing ? to enjoy yourself			0
show your talent rather than show other things			1
’ the fear is that particular ship may already have sailed			0
@entity225 meets @entity246 - for an interview in @entity0 right man for the job it must be great being a @entity252 bigwig			2
the @entity253 queries your probity , and you retort by reciting your cv			0
@entity257 , the @entity258 ’s chief operating officer , was said by the @entity259 , investigating alleged corruption at the 2013 @entity258 , to have known ‘ a contact of a bookie and contacted him eight times in one season ’			0
@entity257 ’s response ? ‘ i hold a @entity267 degree in management and prior to working with the @entity252 , i was employed by a multinational media and advertising agency			0
in all , i have 20 years of experience as a professional with high integrity			0
’ and so on and so forth			0
why did n’t he say so earlier ! when you think about it … there are whispers that @entity278 , who has a finger injury , will miss more than the first test of @entity84 ’s series in @entity37			2
he could , suggests one rumour , miss the entire series			2
@entity278 is definitely out of @entity84 's first test against @entity37 and could miss the entire series this would have three benefits			1
@entity84 can blood @entity287 as their @entity145 captain without saying he has deposed @entity278			0
@entity278 would be spared the possibility of equalling the world record for the number of overseas test defeats as captain			2
his tally stands at 13			0
@entity71 ’s @entity296 and @entity297 of @entity298 both led their teams to 16 away losses			0
and he could prepare for the @entity38 , unencumbered by a form of the game he has never truly enjoyed			0
but those are all cynical theories …			0

@entity1 are saying all the right things but have to perform
omitting @entity94 from warm - up against @entity119 was a *mistake*
@entity1 have had four consecutive odi series defeats under @entity147
@entity147 is reading @entity221 's new *autobiography*
