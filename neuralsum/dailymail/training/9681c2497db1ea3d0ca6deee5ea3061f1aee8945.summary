@entity0 had the perfect word to describe himself after his mauling by @entity3 when @entity4 were last here in the @entity7 capital			1
@entity0 , after disappearing for 49 in two overs , said he felt like a ' wally			1
' yet the fast bowler who has battled his way back to this @entity12 after being described as ' unselectable ' just over a year ago got straight back on the horse against @entity14 and actually bowled as well as he has done in two years			1
now @entity0 , who was so good on tour in @entity7 two years ago that he was almost unplayable in the one - day internationals , feels he is back to his best after a year in which he could easily have fallen away from international cricket			1
@entity0 bowls during a nets session at @entity21 in @entity22 as coach @entity23 ( left ) watches on ' look , in that situation against @entity7 , @entity3 was always going to come hard and it seemed that everything i tried did n't quite work , ' said @entity0			1
' it was one of those days but i 've bowled well throughout this trip and have taken wickets so i do n't feel too downhearted by it			0
' when you 're bowling and it 's disappearing over your head for six it 's not a nice feeling			2
you feel like a wally when you 're out there , but it happened and it 's in the past			2
it 's never happened to me before like that and i 've got him out before			2
' usually if i try something it works but it did n't that day			0
it was one of those days and i 'm very disappointed , gutted and embarrassed by it			2
someone will come that hard at us again but we 'll have to find a way of dealing with it			2
' @entity4 play a match during an @entity4 nets session at @entity21 in @entity22 on thursday @entity55 in discussion with his coach moores and team - mates during the nets session @entity4 actually deserve credit for sticking with @entity0 , who can be fragile in adversity , against @entity14 because they could easily have replaced him with either @entity61 , who has impressed in practice , or @entity63			1
@entity0 responded by taking three wickets to follow his hat - trick and five - wicket haul against @entity67 and while that in itself against @entity14 was not earth shattering the way he bowled was encouraging			1
' i feel normal , ' he said			0
' the amount of wickets i 've taken over here have helped get that confidence back			0
and just playing international cricket and being in the set - up and round the guys day in and day out helps that confidence too			0
so i 'm just a normal cricketer playing cricket now			0
that 's all it is			0
' and back to the old @entity0 , one of most promising fast bowlers in world cricket ? ' yes i 'd say so			1
it feels as though everything is going the way it was for me a couple of years ago and that 's good			0
' @entity4 captain @entity91 plays a shot as he practices his batting not that his hat - trick against @entity67 was a typical fast bowler 's one to be proud of , coming as it did to three catches in the deep off the last three balls of the innings			1
' in 10 years time i 'll tell people it was a classic hat - trick , ' he smiled			0
' i 'll tell them it was three in - swinging yorkers ! i was pleased to get a hat - trick and pleased to do it for @entity4 in a @entity12			1
but i was disappointed to do it off the last three balls of the innings			0
if it had happened earlier then brilliant i 'd have been very happy about it			0
' @entity4 looked relaxed as they returned to work at picturesque @entity21 just outside @entity22 on wednesday , where they engaged in middle practice , recreating match scenarios , rather than the net practice of the @entity116			1
at one point bowling coach @entity117 pulled off a diving catch on the boundary to ' dismiss ' @entity121 , causing assistant coach @entity122 to shout out ' there 's just been a minor earthquake			0
' the more serious business came when @entity4 practiced the death bowling that came in for so much criticism against @entity67 , notably their apparent inability to think on their feet and repeatedly bowl too short			1
' we 're always looking at it and trying to improve , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's been a running theme that teams ' get met ' a little bit over here at the end and we have to buck that trend			0
we sit down and look at it and build plans and days like today , practicing scenarios in the middle , are good			0
when we come to the death overs we 'll have clear plans and we 'll a hundred per cent try to stick to them			0
' but do they stick too rigidly to them ? ' instinct is one of the most important things in cricket , ' insisted @entity0			2
' i hate it when things are preconceived because it becomes too predictable and too obvious			0
' you have to think on your feet , the best bowlers in the world do that , and find a delivery that 's working on that wicket against that batsmen			2
that 's a skill in itself and it 's something we have to get better at			0
' @entity4 know that a win against @entity168 here in a match that starts on saturday night @entity172 time would all but take them to the quarter - finals			1
' every game is significant for us but especially this game on sunday because of the manner in which we got beaten in the first two games , ' said @entity0			2
' we were expected to put in a performance against @entity14 but we got beat by @entity168 in @entity168 so it 's important we go out there and try to stamp our authority in conditions that should favour us			1
' a win here at the @entity184 where they were humiliated by @entity7 would certainly put their @entity12 back on track .			1

@entity4 were humiliated by @entity7 on their last visit to @entity7 's capital city
@entity3 embarrassed @entity4 's bowlers with the bat
@entity0 had a *torrid* time dealing with the @entity197 batsman
@entity0 , however , bounced back with a superb showing against @entity14
