these snowy ' crop circles ' look like they took ages to create			2
no chance , then , that the imprints were made by alien lifeforms leaving behind remarkable patterns for us to gaze at			2
instead , they are the work of a lone artist who has spent up to ten hours a day trudging around a @entity12 ski resort			1
