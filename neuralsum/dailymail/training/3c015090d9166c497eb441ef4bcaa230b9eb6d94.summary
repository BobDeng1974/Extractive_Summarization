a combination treatment including @entity1 could help treat a range of viruses and bacterial infections @entity1 could be key to developing new treatments to combat illnesses including @entity7 , brain cancer , influenza , hepatitis and the superbug @entity12			1
scientists have discovered that drugs which attack the protein @entity15 may pave the way for new treatments			1
the study , at @entity19 clinically tested a drug combination , which included @entity1 and @entity21 , or @entity23 inhibitors , as they are also known			0
researchers found they prevented the replication of a number of different viruses in infected cells			2
they also made antibiotic - resistant bacteria vulnerable to common antibiotics , and killed brain cancer stem cells			1
' basically , we 've got a concept that by attacking @entity15 and related proteins , we hurt cancer cells , inhibit the ability of viruses to infect and the reproduce , and we are able to kill superbug antibiotic - resistant bacteria , said lead investigator , @entity41 , at @entity19 's @entity42			1
the study considered the effects in treating brain cancer , influenza , mumps , measles and rubella , adenovirus , coxsake virus , @entity7 , hepatitis , @entity53 , @entity12 , @entity54 and n. gonorrhoeae			1
@entity15 is part of a family of proteins called chaperones			0
their job is to help shape chains of amino acids into proteins and then to keep those proteins in the correct 3d shape			0
the @entity1 drug combination used in the study attacks @entity15 and other chaperones , thereby killing cancer cells			2
after discovering the effect on cancer cells , professor @entity41 and his team began to target @entity15 for infectious diseases , including viruses and bacterial infections			1
professor @entity41 said : ' the findings open an avenue of being able to treat viral infections , infections that certainly most people would say we 'll never be able to treat			0
' they prove that @entity15 is a " drugable " target to stop viruses from reproducing and spreading			2
' and in the case of bacteria , we have a new antibiotic target , @entity86 , that if we ’re careful and only use the @entity88 drug in hospitals , we ’ve got something that can help to treat the superbugs			0
' he said the next steps have already been taken and are leading to new discoveries			0
scientists at @entity19 discovered that by attacking a protein known as @entity15 , virus like @entity7 , pictured , can be prevented from reproducing in cells ' we know in mice that the @entity1 treatment can kill tumour cells but does n't harm normal tissues like the liver and the heart			1
' of even more importance , we 've just discovered that the @entity1 combination for making tumour cells resistant to chemotherapy and for stopping life - saving brain cancer chemotherapy from entering into the brain and killing cancer			1
' researchers from university have previously found @entity1 drug combinations can be beneficial in other ways			0
in 2010 , dr @entity116 and professor @entity117 , working with professor @entity41 , found @entity1 improved the effectiveness of the breast cancer treatment @entity120 , while protecting the heart from the harm caused by chemotherapy			0
in 2013 and 2014 professor @entity41 obtained similar data with @entity1 and conventional chemotherapy in bladder , pancreatic and paediatric brain cancer cells			1
based on professor @entity41 's new study , a new phase one clinical trial will open at @entity132 combining the colon cancer drug regorafenib with @entity1 for all solid tumour patients			0
the pre-clinical study was published this month in the @entity136			0
the researchers also discovered the treatment was able to kill brain cancer cells , pictured			2

scientists have identified a protein @entity15 key to treating a range of illnesses including @entity7 , brain cancer , hepatitis , @entity12 and influenza
by attacking the protein cancer cells are killed , viruses are prevented from infecting and reproducing and antibiotic - resistant bacteria are killed
could pave the way for a raft of new treatments to combat illnesses
