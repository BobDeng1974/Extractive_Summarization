hometown boy @entity0 held his nerve to close out victory at the @entity3 at @entity4			1
the @entity6 player added to his @entity8 title this season and three @entity11 victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four - shot overnight lead			1
@entity13 was second on seven under , having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes			1
@entity0 poses with the @entity3 trophy after recording a four - shot win @entity0 took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014 @entity0 went into his final round with four - shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage @entity0 birdied the par - five second when he laid up short of the green , pitched on and holed a straight eight - foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth			1
another bogey at the seventh was off - set as he pitched stone - dead from an awkward bunker stance at the next , and he birdied 10 as well before dropping a shot at 12			2
playing partner @entity13 made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45 - foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe , there was scope for @entity0 to crack			1
instead , the @entity4 resident struck a lovely pin - high tee shot and read the left - to - right break to perfection on the ensuing 16 - foot putt			2
his birdie was matched by @entity13 but the four - shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot , @entity0 also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet			1
@entity13 did likewise and both parred the last to leave @entity0 as the tour 's first repeat winner this season			1
he told @entity54 : ' it 's at home and it 's cool , you can feel support of friends , family and fans			0
it does n't happen often , to win in your home town			0
' it played hard today , sometimes it 's hard to make pars			0

i 'll head over tomorrow and take another look at it			0
' @entity94 , the third player in the group , finished third outright at four under			0
