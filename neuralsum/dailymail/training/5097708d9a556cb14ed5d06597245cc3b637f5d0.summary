farming has been blamed for turning modern - day men into weaklings , and now agriculture has been linked to causing dental problems			1
before the introduction of agricultural processes , hunter - gatherers had what has been dubbed as ‘ perfect harmony ’ between the shape of their jaws and the size and alignment of their teeth			1
but as farming became more widespread , and food became easier to chew , jaws shrunk and in turn triggered the beginnings of a condition known as malocclusion and dental crowding			1
researchers from the @entity25 analysed the lower jaws and teeth of 292 skeletons from the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , dating back between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago			1
they discovered that hunter - gatherers had an almost ‘ perfect harmony ’ between their lower jaws and teeth ( example pictured ) researchers from the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) analysed the lower jaws and teeth dimensions of 292 skeletons from the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , dating back between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago			1
this included hunter - gatherers , semi-sedentary hunter - gatherers , transitional farmers , and farmers			1
skeletons were studied from different regions in order to rule out specific geographic anomalies			0
in the case of hunter - gatherers , the scientists from @entity25 , led by professor @entity49 , @entity50 , and the @entity51 , @entity52 , found a correlation between inter-individual jawbones and dental distances , suggesting an almost ‘ perfect ’ state of equilibrium between the two			1
@entity60 is the medical term for teeth that are out of position			0
it can occur as teeth develop in children as a result of certain behaviours , such as thumb sucking , or an injury to the teeth or bones of the face			0
many cases of malocclusion do not pose serious health concerns			0
however , if malocclusion is not corrected , it can affect the appearance of the teeth and the shape of the face			0
severe cases of malocclusion can also make it difficult to eat , or clean teeth			0
today , malocclusion and dental crowding affects around one in five people in modern - world populations			2
while in the case of semi-sedentary hunter - gatherers and farming groups , they found no such correlation			1
this suggests the ' harmony ' between the teeth and the jawbone was disrupted during the shift towards agriculture			0
the researchers believe farming practices led to changes in diet that directly impacted the shape and structure of the jawbones			2
for example , the diet of a hunter - gatherer was based on ‘ hard ’ foods such as wild uncooked vegetables and meat			1
by comparison , the staple diet of the sedentary farmer is based on ‘ soft ’ cooked or processed foods like cereals and legumes			0
eating soft cooked foods requires less , chewing which in turn lessened the size of the jaws			0
however , instead of the farmers ’ jaws and teeth simply being smaller versions of their ancestors ’ , the jaws reduced in size while the teeth kept the same dimensions			2
without adequate space for the teeth in the mouths of farmers , this led to malocclusion – the misalignment of teeth - and dental crowding			1
today , malocclusion and dental crowding affects around one in five people in modern - world populations			2
‘ our analysis shows that the lower jaws of the world 's earliest farmers in the @entity29 are not simply smaller versions of those of the predecessor hunter - gatherers , but that the lower jaw underwent a complex series of shape changes commensurate with the transition to agriculture , ’ said professor @entity49			1
but , the jaws of semi-sedentary , and farming groups showed signs of dental crowding ( pictured )			1
the experts said farming led to dietary changes that impacted the structure of the jaw			2
hunter - gatherers needed stronger , larger jaws to chew ' hard ' foods , but sedentary farmers ate ‘ soft ’ foods , which required less chewing the experts measured the jaws ( pictured ) , and found that the farmers ’ jaws and teeth were n't just smaller versions of their ancestors ’ , instead , the jaws reduced in size but the teeth kept the same dimensions			1
without adequate space for the teeth , this led to malocclusion - the misalignment of teeth ‘ our findings show that the hunter gatherer populations have an almost ‘ perfect harmony ’ between their lower jaws and teeth , ’ he explained			1
‘ but this harmony begins to fade when you examine the lower jaws and teeth of the earliest farmers ’			1
the findings are published in the journal @entity205			0
last year , separate research , covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution , revealed modern - day skeletons are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter - gatherer ancestors			2
in fact , the bones of our early ancestors were comparable in strength to modern orangutans , but once farming spread , these bones became 20 per cent weaker			0
research from the @entity222 , covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution , recently revealed modern - day skeletons ( pictured bottom ) are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter - gatherer ancestors ( pictured top )			2
they studied hip joints on ancient femurs research from the @entity222 - covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution - recently revealed modern - day skeletons are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter - gatherer ancestors			2
in fact , the bones of our early ancestors were comparable in strength to modern orangutans , but once farming spread , these bones became 20 per cent weaker			0
researchers used x-rays and ct scans to study ancient samples of human femur bones , along with femora from other primate species			0
in particular , they focused on the inside of the femoral head - the ball at the top of the femur which fits into the pelvis to form the hip joint			0
the bones studied covered four distinct archaeological human populations			0
the trabecular , mesh - like structure was found to be similar in all populations , but hunter - gatherers ( left ) from 7,000 years ago had a much higher amount of actual bone relative to air than agriculturalists ( right ) just 1,000 years later the structure was found to be very similar in all populations , but the hunter - gatherers had a much higher amount of actual bone relative to air			1
this thickening is the result of constant loading on the bone from physical activity as hunter - gatherers roamed the landscape , seeking food			1
this exertion would result in minor damage that caused the bone mesh to grow back stronger and thicker throughout life - building to a ' peak point ' of bone strength , which counter-balanced the deterioration of bones with age			0
bone mass was around 20 per cent higher in the foragers - the equivalent to what an average person would lose after three months of weightlessness in space			0
and after ruling out diet differences and changes in body size as possible causes , researchers concluded a drop in physical activity are the root cause of degradation in human bone strength across millennia .			0

researchers analysed lower jaws and teeth of 292 skeletons from the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago
they found differences in the jaw structure of hunter - gatherers and farmers
hunter - gatherers had a ‘ perfect harmony ’ between lower jaws and teeth
while the jaws of semi-sedentary , and farmers revealed dental crowding
hunter - gatherers required larger jaws to chew *raw* vegetables , for example
but as farming led to cooked and processed food , jaw shapes shrunk
however , the size of teeth *remained* the same , which led to dental problems
