in the coming days pope @entity3 will be decked out in the regulation outfit of every pontiff			1
the 76 - year - old 's current papal outfit is an off - the - peg dress and cassock chosen from one of three vestments laid out yesterday			2
the @entity38 tailors , who have dressed seven of the holy pontiff over two centuries , had prepared three sets of outfits , in small , medium and large , ready for a new pope of any size			1
pope @entity3 waves to the crowds from the steps of the @entity11 in @entity12 alongside cardinal @entity50 of @entity51 , left , and cardinal @entity52 , @entity53 , right @entity3 , right , prays before an icon of @entity55 during a private visit to the @entity11 a day after he was elected @entity57 and with cardinals and clergymen as he leaves , left pope @entity3 prayed for guidance in the hours after he was elected as the new @entity57 the clothes were left in a room next to the @entity63 known as the ' @entity64 '			1
a made - to - measure outfit will now be made for @entity66 and takes up to three days			1
the new @entity3 's outfit will consist of a skirt of ivory wool , a white cassock with sleeves and 33 buttons that symbolise @entity74 's age			0
he will also wear the white skullcap , a pair of red leather shoes and a ' mozzetta ' , which is worn over the shoulders			0
six pairs of the red shoes - the colour to represent the blood of martyrs - famously worn by retired pope @entity84 were also crafted in advance			1
the costs of the papal clothes is not made public			2
@entity93 , founded in 1798 via @entity88 , a stone 's throw from the @entity91 , in @entity12 , @entity92 , are known as the ' santari ' or ecclesiastical tailors and work exclusively for the @entity3 and thousands of priests			0
the @entity3 acknowledges the crowds to people who have come to see him before getting into a waiting car pope @entity3 pictured leaving the @entity11 will lead his inaugural mass on tuesday the @entity100 said @entity38 said : ' the model has remained the same as that mandated by @entity104 , more than one hundred and fifty years ago , and since then all we pack for the @entity57 responds to these canons , albeit with some license imposed by the various flavours of the @entity57			1
' to pope @entity109 @entity111 - for example , we had to replace the white dress immediately after his elections , because it was wet with tears of his emotion			2
' @entity117 , instead , was used to ask for light clothing and without sleeves , because he was a strong , warm , and " sports " man			0
' it would be disrespectful to reveal the detail of the costs			0
ours is a very specialised craft work , but i can assure you that the prices are not excessive as it was led to believe			0
' we like to think that we sew the fabric and make the dress , @entity129 instead makes the @entity3			0
' @entity66 also has his own @entity57 ring - the @entity133 - that is worn on the third finger of his right hand			1
the ring is cast in gold for each @entity3 and bears the image of @entity140 in a boat			0
six pairs of the red @entity57 shoes , famously worn by pope @entity84 , pictured , were laid out for the new pope pope @entity3 will have his own gold ring of the fisherman made			1

the official papal wardrobe consists of various mozzettas ( short capes ) , rochets , which are worn over the cassock , and stoles in red and white and some trimmed with ermine and gold embroidery			0
they are worn with the white cassock and the white zucchetto or skullcap and red or white shoes			0
the colours symbolise the innocence and sacrifice of @entity74			0
tradition dictates that the stole and shoes should always match the colour of the mozzetta but individual @entity57 can go against the grain			2
pope @entity84 chose to wear the red shoes in public , even if he was not wearing the red stole			2
he also reintroduced the red wide - brimmed straw hat to the @entity57 wardrobe , according to @entity190			1
according to the website , protocol dictates in which combination the clothes are worn depending on who the @entity3 is meeting			2
when the @entity3 meets a @entity158 head of state he wears the rochet , mozzetta and a stole , but no stole if the head of state if not catholic .			0
