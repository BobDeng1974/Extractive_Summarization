eating 28g of yoghurt daily - around a quarter of a small pot – cuts the odds of developing the disease by almost a fifth , a study found			2
the research , from the @entity7 in the @entity8 , suggests the popular food could provide an inexpensive and easy way of boosting the odds of a healthy old age			1
type 2 diabetes , the form of the condition studied , is fuelled by obesity			1
it usually develops in middle - age and over time triggers disabling and deadly complications , from blindness to heart attacks and strokes			2
a study has found that eating just 28g of yoghurt daily - around a quarter of a small pot – cuts the odds of developing diabetes by almost a fifth it eats up a tenth of the @entity33 budget and with some 3million sufferers in the @entity35 alone and numbers rising as the obesity epidemic bites , anything that prevents it could have a massive impact health as well as on the healthcare system			1
the @entity8 researchers began by crunching together the results of three long - term studies into diet and health			0
these involved almost 200,000 men and women , who were studied for up to 30 years and provided detailed information on their diet			0
all were free of diabetes at the start of the study but 15,156 had developed it by the end			0
analysis of their diet showed no link between the disease and their total intake of dairy products			0
milk or cheese alone had no effect			0
however , eating yoghurt seemed to stave off the disease			0
the researchers then added in data from other studies , meaning they had information on almost half a million people			0
this showed that one 28 helping of yoghurt a day cut the odds of type 2 diabetes by 18 per cent			1
type 2 diabetes , the form of the condition studied , is fuelled by obesity and usually develops in middle - age			1
file photo senior researcher @entity82 ( @entity83 ) said : ‘ we found that higher intake of yoghurt is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes , whereas other dairy foods and consumption of total dairy did not show this association			1
‘ the consistent findings for yoghurt suggest that it can be incorporated into a healthy dietary pattern			2
’ professor @entity82 ’s research , published in the journal @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , follows other work that has credited yoghurt with keeping people trim			2
it is thought that the bacteria in yoghurt help keep the metabolism on an even keel			0
they may also replace bugs in our stomachs that would normally pump out obesity - fuelling toxins			0
it is also possible that people who regularly eat yoghurt have it as a dessert and so eat fewer sweet puddings than others			0
dr @entity119 , of charity @entity120 , said : ‘ this work adds to existing evidence that people who eat yoghurt are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes , but what it does n’t tell us is whether eating yoghurt can directly reduce risk of type 2 diabetes			1
‘ it could be that those eating yoghurt who took part in the study were more likely to lead a healthy lifestyle , which we know can help to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes			1
‘ that is why more research will be needed before we can change our advice that the best way to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes is by maintaining a healthy weight , being physically active and eating a healthy balanced diet that is low in salt , fat and sugar			1

research suggests yoghurt could be an easy and inexpensive way to boots odds of a healthy old age
type 2 diabetes is fueleld by obesity and usually develops in middle age
there are around 3million sufferers in the @entity35 alone with numbers rising
