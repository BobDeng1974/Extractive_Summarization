the black and white snaps depict the men in uniform having a raucous time in their mess , far removed from the misery of the trenches on the @entity15			1
the officers of the @entity17 are seen smoking cigars and cigarettes and having a good old knees up in the incredibly rare photo collection which is being put up for auction			1
a rip - roaring good time : members of the @entity17 can be seen swigging champagne and smoking cigars in @entity25 during the @entity6 dangerous job : it seems the @entity3 pilots adopted a similar philosophy to their @entity31 counterparts : ' live for today , tomorrow we die ' finally found : the unique images of the @entity3 pilots kept in a 14inch by 12inch album were found in a box of personal effects inherited by a man in @entity38 from a relative			1
it is believed the album was kept by a @entity31 serviceman after the @entity3 surrendered in 1918 coming just 11 years after the first ever flight by the @entity44 , air warfare was a new but very risky concept during the @entity6			1
it was said the men of the @entity31 @entity49 ’ adopted the philosophy of ‘ live for today , tomorrow we die ’ , such was the deadly nature of their job			0
and judging by the dozens of rare photos that have emerged , it seems their @entity3 counterparts also had a similar attitude to wartime life			1
there are several group photos depicting the men guzzling bottles of champagne and glasses of beer and liquor			1
in one amusing image , all 10 @entity3 officers appear to be in a drunken stupour , with four of them hugging each other and singing out loud while another looks like he has passed out			1
in another , a line of four inebriated flyers lean to one side as they lose their balance while sitting for the camera			0

the identities of the airmen are n’t known although they were part of 24 and 54 squadrons of the @entity17 or the @entity122			1
it is known that some of the photos were taken in december 1917 as a christmas tree and decorations can be seen in them			2
some of the pilots ' obvious mantra to live life to the fullest is not surprising considering the high mortality rate for those in the air force			2
during @entity6 , aircrew casualties , who were killed , missing or taken prisoner , totalled 8,604 and a further 7,302 were wounded			1
by the end of the war , the @entity17 possessed a total of 2,709 frontline aircraft , 56 airships , 186 balloon detachments and about 4,500 flying personnel			1

@entity183 , of @entity180 , said : ' i have never seen anything like this photo album before			0
' if it was a @entity49 album , then it would be rare but to have a @entity3 one from the same period is unheard of			2
' the survival rate of these flyers was terrible and it looks like these men lived life to the full while they had the chance			0
' it is a very important and historical record and is unusual because there are a lot of natural and relaxed pictures rather than the staged and formal photos of that period			2
' it gives you a feel of what it was like to have been there			0
it would n’t surprise me if this album ended up going into a museum because it is so rare			2
' the auction takes place on thursday			2
destruction : a photograph showing the damage from several bombs was also in the album alongside pictures of the pilots making merry			2

the @entity17 formed the basis of what would become the @entity3 @entity264 ( @entity17 ) in 1916 , which was the air arm of the @entity3 army during @entity6			1
the @entity264 drastically expanded during the war to accommodate the new types of aircraft , doctrine , tactics and the needs of the ground troops , in particularly the artillery			0

most notable were the single seat fighter squadrons or ' @entity283 ' which is short for @entity283 - literally meaning ' hunting squadron ' - in order to counter the offensive operations of the @entity49 and the @entity117 @entity287			0
on june 24 , 1917 , the @entity17 formed its first fighter wing , the @entity289 and more units quickly followed			1
and just like their @entity31 counterpart , the @entity3 @entity264 had famous fighter pilots who inspired bravery in their comrades and struck fear into the heart of the enemy			2
and @entity246 , better known as the @entity246 , was considered to be the best			0
the @entity3 fighter pilot is considered @entity3 's top ace of @entity6 - being officially credited with 80 air combat victories			1

he quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot , and during 1917 became leader of @entity308 and then the larger unit @entity310 1 - better known as the ' @entity311 '			0
by 1918 , he was regarded as a national hero in @entity3 , and was very well known by the other side			0
@entity246 was shot down and killed near @entity314 on 21 april 1918			0
there has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career , especially the circumstances of his death			0
