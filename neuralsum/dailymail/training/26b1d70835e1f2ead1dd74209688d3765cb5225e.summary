by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 is not the type to speak in headlines			1
the young @entity6 defender will never use three words when one will suffice			1
his voice is so quiet it stretches digital technology to its limits			2
and yet , sitting in @entity12 ’s main stand after saturday ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity14 , the on - loan defender made a big , brash statement			1
looking ahead to thursday ’s @entity19 curtain raiser in @entity20 , the 20 - year - old expressed the belief that @entity23 ’s men could actually reach the final , an honour last achieved at @entity26 in 2003 by a team featuring @entity28 , @entity30 et al			1
@entity2 claims that @entity12 are good enough to reach the final of the @entity19 this year ‘ everyone is disappointed about not getting into the @entity36 , because all the supporters and all of the players wanted to be there , ’ said the 19 - year - old currently on loan from @entity34			1
‘ but we ca n’t focus on the past and say : “ that ’s bad			2
” we must concentrate on the @entity19 and do all we can do in that competition			1
‘ if we play as we can , if we play to 100 per cent of our ability , we can go to the final			1
@entity12 is a big club with high expectations and we will try to meet them			1
’ on the evidence of the season so far , even mentioning @entity12 in the same sentence as a @entity19 final in @entity50 is strong stuff			1
this is a team who have won five of their 11 competitive games so far			2
a team who are in transition			2
@entity23 ’s side have had two cracks at the @entity36 and blown them both ; a fact that @entity14 ’s travelling support were quick to cast up on saturday			2
one of those attempts , of course , was against @entity68 and ended in a 6 - 1 defeat , before the most unexpected of @entity71 reprieves arrived on a technicality amid much acrimony			2
were @entity12 to make it to the @entity78 capital , then , their green and white shirts would have to be insulated by flak jackets			1
@entity12 beat @entity14 2 - 1 in @entity80 , goals from @entity2 and @entity82 sealed it for the @entity83 there were signs of improvement against @entity14 , no question			1
@entity23 pronounced himself particularly delighted with the return to fitness of captain @entity90			2
new loan signing @entity92 was only denied a debut goal by an offside flag			1
and @entity95 had some decent touches long before he was embroiled in disturbing accusations of racism towards @entity14 full - back @entity99			2
but @entity2 summed up @entity12 ’s performance perfectly when he said : ‘ it ’s good , it ’s okay			1
‘ i think we are getting close to how the manager wants us to play			2
in the first half against @entity14 , we did very well			2
the second half was more difficult			2
we need to train more now , we need time and we will be better			2
’ at 2 - 0 ahead after 46 minutes @entity12 were coasting , then , from nowhere , a football match broke out			1
by time up @entity14 were nursing a sense of injustice and discontent at their failure to take a point at least			2
as in his home league debut against @entity116 , @entity2 set the ball rolling early			1
a @entity82 corner in the seventh minute was flicked by an @entity14 head towards the back post where @entity121 thrashed a volley off his defensive team - mate on the goal - line and into the net			0
@entity2 is on loan from @entity127 champions @entity34 for the season it was an odd affair , @entity2 saying : ‘ i remember a little bit about the goal			1
the ball came to @entity133 and he took a shot			0
the ball hit a defender , then hit me and went in the goal			0
i ’m very happy to score two goals in two home games now and it gives me more confidence			0
’ in control of the game , @entity12 made it 2 - 0 in the first minute of the second half , @entity150 ’s cut back from the right side picking out commons , the attacker ’s left foot strike deflecting off a luckless @entity99 and past @entity147 in goal for 2 - 0			1
at which point the game seemed safe			0
commons , his future in doubt after his omission from the two @entity161 games with @entity162 , had proven his value once more			0
with half an hour remaining , however , the game finally began to fulfil pre-match expectations			0
@entity14 , the team rated most likely to challenge @entity12 this season , began to play			1
why it took them so long is the question			0
@entity172 produced the first of a string of fine saves from @entity176 before @entity177 scored his first goal for the club , swooping to nod @entity181 ’s back post knock down into the net from six yards out			0
suddenly , @entity14 were back in the game			0
@entity186 would later describe the home team ’s display in the final half hour as ‘ vulnerable , agitated and nervy			1
’ he was n’t wrong			0
as well as @entity2 , @entity12 have also loaned @entity190 striker @entity189 from @entity34 the game might easily have swung the way of an invigorated visiting side but for @entity176 , fast becoming @entity12 ’s best piece of transfer business in quite some time			1
the @entity197 keeper parried @entity199 ’s thumping shot from 18 yards , then pushed away @entity201 ’s rising long range shot towards the top corner			0
yet @entity14 were irate when referee @entity203 failed to award a penalty when commons raised his hands to block a @entity199 free kick			0
@entity186 argued the point with the referee on the long walk down the tunnel and did so again vocally in the post-match press conference			0
later on , a @entity14 grievance against @entity95 for altogether more serious reasons would make this a trying day for the official			0
raised hands remain one of football ’s great grey areas			0
an incessant bone of contention			0
had they scored a penalty , @entity186 believes his team would have won			0
as it transpired , their last chance to take at least a point passed in 81 minutes when substitute @entity229 knocked down a @entity177 cross and @entity199 blazed the ball over the bar			0
how @entity12 ’s shuddering , shaky last half hour display squares with @entity2 ’s belief that the team have it in them to reach the @entity19 final is unclear			1
but the @entity26 side can certainly take confidence from the performance of @entity240			0
the @entity242 defender was unhappy with the reluctance of the champions to sell him in the final days of the transfer window , but turned in a solid , professional performance to allay concerns over his ongoing levels of commitment			1
‘ i feel very good playing alongside @entity240 , ’ said @entity2 in admiration afterwards			1
‘ he speaks to me a lot			0
when he speaks , it is not aggressively			0
it is better to speak calmly , we understand each other better that way			0
‘ @entity240 is a very good player and i think he can play at the highest level			0
i ’m very happy he stayed at the club			0
’ in the final stages of this see - saw football match , they all were .			1

@entity12 can reach @entity19 final , says @entity2
@entity2 is on loan from @entity127 champions @entity34
@entity12 face @entity20 in first @entity19 group match
