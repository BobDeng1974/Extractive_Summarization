a government agency in @entity1 has published a report on two photographs showing an object which it claims ' can be qualified as a @entity6			1
' the @entity7 for the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) , part of @entity1 's @entity10 of @entity11 , studied photographs of the object after it was spotted by four engineers above a remote copper mine			1
according to the report , the engineers described the object as ' a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [ 16 to 32 feet ]			2
it performed ascending , descending and horizontal movements in short lengths , about 600 meters above the ground			0
while the engineers did not want to talk about the sighting , the photographer did tell a colleague at the mine , who sent copies of the images to the @entity9 earlier this year			2
the engineer who sent the pictures on to the government agency also passed on information provided to him by the witnesses , the @entity55 has reported			1
following investigations , the @entity9 ruled out the possibility of any meteorological phenomena , including lenticular clouds , along with experimental aircraft , planes , and weather balloons , according to the @entity67			1
the agency also ruled out the possibility of drones in the area			1
@entity9 international affairs director @entity72 told @entity73 , for the @entity55 : ' fishing companies use drones and they make a lot of noise			0
this was definitely not a drone			0
' according to the report , the engineers described the object as ' a flattened disc of brilliant colour with a diameter of 5 to 10 metres [ 16 to 32 feet ] ' the study concludes : ' it is an object or phenomenon of great interest , and it can be qualified as a @entity6			1
' caution has been urged however regarding the conclusions , primarily as the four engineers who witnessed the incident refused to co-operate with the agency conducting the investigation			2
the report was released in the same week as the @entity95 revealed they were responsible for a number of ' @entity6 ' sightings in @entity98 in the 1950s			0
throughout the decade , numerous lights in the sky were reported by members of the public and pilots alike , with some suggesting they were of extraterrestrial origin			0
the study concludes : ' it is an object or phenomenon of great interest , and it can be qualified as a @entity6 ' but the @entity95 last week revealed it was the agency flying their secretive u- 2 aircraft high in the atmosphere			1
in a tweet the @entity95 said : ‘ remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ‘ 50s ? that was us			0
’ meanwhile , a series of images from @entity121 's @entity120 , which shows a white dot appearing to descend to the surface of @entity124 , was also explained this week			0
while one @entity125 claimed the images was evidence of a @entity6 landing on the red planet , @entity121 said the anomaly can be easily explained as a so - called ' hot pixel ' in one of the cameras .			0

government agency in @entity1 says object is ' of great interest , and it can be qualified as a @entity6 '
committee for the @entity8 studied photographs after object was spotted by engineers at copper mine
@entity141 ruled out possibility of meteorological phenomena as well as experimental aircraft , planes , weather balloons and drones
