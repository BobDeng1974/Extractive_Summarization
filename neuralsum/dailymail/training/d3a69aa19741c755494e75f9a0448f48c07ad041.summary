by @entity0 last updated at 12:56 am on 30th december 2011 rail passengers in @entity3 pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their @entity6 neighbours , figures reveal today			1
they come as passengers brace themselves for a fresh round of fare rises of up to 11 per cent from monday , and against a background of worsening train punctuality			2
critics say consumers are being ‘ ripped off ’ by an alliance of greedy train companies and tax - hungry treasury ministers while passengers on the @entity18 pay significantly less for their journeys			2
rail passengers in @entity3 pay up to ten times more for their tickets than their @entity6 neighbours , figures reveal today a report by the @entity22 shows @entity3 train passengers pay three - and - a - half times more than even the most expensive equivalent commuter journey of 21 - 24 miles highlighted on the other side of the @entity26			1
it says a 2011 annual season ticket for the journey from @entity31 to @entity32 , including @entity33 in the capital , costs £ 3,268			1
yet a similar 22 - mile trip from @entity36 to @entity37 costs @entity39 season ticket holders just £ 336.17 – nearly a tenth of the price			1
in @entity46 , a season ticket for the 24 - mile trip from @entity44 to @entity45 costs £ 924.66 – a third of the @entity3 fare			1
the cost of a season ticket on the 21 - mile @entity52 - to - @entity53 route in @entity54 is £ 705.85 , while the 22 - mile journey from @entity56 to @entity57 costs @entity59 season ticket holders £ 653.74			1
the @entity22 ’s figures include the cost of travel on each city ’s underground system			2
the group ’s @entity65 said : ‘ when the cost of season tickets is so much higher than other @entity6 capitals , the fare rises are starting to affect the @entity3 ’s competitiveness			1
' we still have the highest fares in @entity6 , and they will be around 24 per cent higher by the next election			0
’ the @entity75 described the study as ‘ a flimsy piece of research that does not stand up to scrutiny , focusing on just one season ticket out of tens of thousands available ’			1
but the @entity82 transport union boss @entity81 said it was ‘ more proof that @entity3 passengers are getting robbed blind by a combination of train operator greed and government incompetence ’			1
on monday , more than 100million inflation - busting @entity89 rail fares go ‘ live ’ , with an average rise – covering both regulated and unregulated fares – of 5.9 per cent			0
regulated fares , which include season tickets and make up around 40 per cent of the total , will rise by an average of 6 per cent			2
but train companies have ‘ flexibility ’ to add another 5 per cent – making 11 per cent rises possible – provided other fares come down to compensate and keep the ‘ average ’ at 6 per cent			0
the basic 6 per cent rise in regulated fares is set by the government and based on the july 2011 @entity102 inflation figure plus 1 per cent			0
ministers had planned to increase the fare cap to @entity102 plus 3 per cent , but this was reversed by @entity107 ’s autumn statement in november			0
however , it is expected to apply from january 2013			0
on unregulated fares , which make up around 60 per cent of the total , there is no limit on rises			0
one of the highest increases – 8 per cent – will see a @entity115 to @entity32 season ticket , including travel on the capital ’s underground , rise from £ 4,304 to £ 4,644			1
and commuters from @entity122 to @entity32 who include @entity124 travel in their season tickets will be hit with a 6 per cent rise from £ 7,592 to £ 8,048			2
@entity75 chief executive @entity127 defended the rises , saying ‘ money raised through fares helps pay for new trains , faster services and better stations ’			0
the @entity134 said it recognised the ‘ pressure on family budgets ’ and cited the decision to keep regulated fare rises at @entity102 plus 1 per cent , but added : ‘ revenue from fares is helping to deliver one of the biggest programmes of rail capacity improvements for 100 years			0
’ last week , the @entity144 took enforcement action against @entity146 for worsening punctuality , with one train in eight ( 13 per cent ) running late .			0

£ 3,000 season ticket in @entity3 is just £ *300* in @entity39
