the streets of @entity1 yesterday rang with the sound of panic			2
it came in the form of anxious gossip in queues at banks and bureaux de change as @entity10 lined up to exchange their roubles for hard currency			1
it came in the form of whirring cash registers as @entity1 rushed to buy imported groceries and furniture before prices soared , emptying the shelves at the mega-malls that have sprung up around the capital			2
and it came in the form of a babble of lies from state television as it tried to reassure @entity10 that the government is fully in control			1
except it clearly was not			0
this week may well be remembered as the moment the wheels fell off @entity31 ’s economy and the collapse of his regime really began			0
his government has tried increasingly desperate measures to prop up confidence in the rouble , and yet its slide has only accelerated – and the sheen of invincibility that the @entity10 people once accorded their leader has begun to wear off			1
‘ we ’ve lost the feeling that @entity31 is some kind of wizard who controls everything , ’ wrote the usually rabidly @entity57 tabloid @entity56			0
in fairness , the rouble ’s slide has been slowed a little by massive spending of @entity10 ’s hard currency reserves , even though just days earlier the @entity68 had promised to stop wasting precious dollars on such apparently futile actions			1
the reason for this change of heart is simple – today @entity31 is due to give his annual marathon press conference , televised live , and he does not want to appear before the nation as the rouble tanks			0
‘ but after the conference , ’ one @entity1 banker joked grimly , ‘ we can expect the deluge			0
’ hard cash : people queue at an exchange in front of electronic information board displaying exchange rates in @entity1 yesterday as they try to exchange the roubles in their wallets for more stable dollars or euros investments : a man studies the contents of his bags in front of a luxury @entity94 boutique in @entity1 , where @entity10 are buying expensive goods that might keep their value better than the plummeting currency @entity31 faces a perfect storm of economic problems			1
the principal one – the collapse in world oil prices that has hit all energy - producing countries – is beyond his control			0
but much of this crisis is of @entity31 ’s own making , and unique to @entity10			1
for one thing , despite countless promises to do so , he has failed dismally to diversify the grotesquely corrupt @entity10 economy away from oil and gas			1
while oil prices were high , it did n’t seem to matter – indeed , @entity10 ’s energy exports fuelled a boom with average wages rising 15-fold since @entity31 came to power			1
but now they ’ve gone through the floor it is a very different matter			0
furthermore , @entity31 ’s belligerence has turned a crisis into a catastrophe			0
in the wake of the shooting down of @entity130 flight @entity129 in july by @entity1 - backed @entity132 rebels , the @entity125 and @entity126 imposed simple but devastating economic sanctions on @entity10 companies			1
by banning a swathe of state - controlled companies from borrowing on international money markets , the @entity135 poisoned the heart of @entity10 ’s economy			1
@entity10 companies owe @entity40 creditors nearly $ 700billion – and between now and the end of 2015 will have to pay back some $ 150billion of that money			1
with access to @entity40 banks cut off , the only place they can turn to for the hard currency needed to pay back those debts is the state – and this week , by some estimates , @entity10 ’s hard currency reserves fell below the level required to service these companies ’ loans			1
already it ’s clear that @entity31 ’s priority is to protect his cronies first and foremost			0
on tuesday he ordered the @entity68 to issue $ 10billion in bonds to bail out the state - owned @entity161 oil company , run by @entity31 ’s long - time @entity163 colleague , @entity162			0
though the company denied it , @entity1 financiers suspect @entity161 immediately used the money to buy hard currency			1
panic buying : women push carts with their purchases at the @entity173 store on the outskirts of @entity1 last chance : @entity1 buy imported electronic appliances while their money will still stretch to afford them other members of @entity10 ’s super rich are trying to convert their roubles into @entity183 property			1
@entity184 , of estate agents @entity186 , said : ‘ i have half a dozen @entity10 clients urgently looking to spend over £ 20million each on buying a new home in prime @entity183			1
’ in @entity1 their less wealthy countrymen were flocking to stores to snap up home appliances , cars and electrical goods			1
customers stormed @entity173 while @entity195 suspended online sales			0
the fact that economic collapse now threatens the @entity31 regime means the situation is terrifyingly volatile			0
given his past form , it ’s more than likely that @entity31 ’s @entity163 - trained instinct will be to try to repress all opposition to his rule – even though it is growing by the day			0
worse , there ’s a strong possibility that he will attempt to distract the population with a military adventure			0
the annexation of @entity212 in february brought a giant , if relatively short - lived , spike in popularity			0
already in recent weeks @entity10 troops , ships and planes have been playing cat - and - mouse with @entity219			1
@entity220 has reported at least one near miss in its airspace between an airliner and a @entity10 military plane			2
@entity226 jets have been scrambled to see off incursions into @entity229 air space 100 times this year alone			0
and @entity10 bombers armed with nuclear missiles have resumed long - range flights over the coasts of the @entity125			2
this may be nothing but posturing by a president whose only language is that of macho , cold - war era military display			0
but for @entity10 ’s nervous @entity219 - member neighbours – especially the @entity246 states such as @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 – there is a real belief that he could lash out			1
closely watched : @entity226 @entity253 jets were scrambled in october to track this @entity10 @entity255 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity229 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers			2
followed : these @entity226 images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by @entity262 near @entity229 airspace the bombers which flew near @entity229 were just two of 26 @entity10 planes intercepted over @entity267 in 24 hours @entity31 has ratcheted up his rhetoric against the @entity135 since the beginning of the @entity132 crisis in february : ‘ @entity219 remains a military alliance , and we are against having a military alliance making itself at home right in our own backyard , ’ he warned			2
meanwhile , even though @entity125 president @entity279 always held off from directly supporting @entity281 ’s army in its struggle against @entity10 - backed militias in @entity281 , the newly elected @entity278 - dominated @entity277 recently authorized the provision of $ 350million of weaponry for the @entity132			2
this could be just the kind of excuse @entity31 has been waiting for to escalate the conflict in @entity281			0
he knows that @entity10 aggression increases global tension – and that this has always led to increases in oil prices			2
the fact is that @entity10 ’s failed economy and increasingly restive population mean @entity31 is cornered , like a wounded animal , with very few options left			2
that is why , right now , he is more dangerous than ever .			0

@entity10 currency plummets despite interest rate rises and reserve spend
*super-rich* *oligarchs* are desperately trying to buy @entity183 real estate
while ordinary @entity10 invest in *consumer* tech , appliances and cars
