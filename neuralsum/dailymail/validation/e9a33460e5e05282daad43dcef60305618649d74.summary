cocaine use in @entity1 has trebled in two decades , with a new ' phenomenon ' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties			1
a new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer ' the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities '			1
its authors found the drug is now ' firmly embedded in @entity1 society ' , and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it			1
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens , but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties the @entity27 said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid- 1990s			1
it follows the emergence of a market in cheap , low - purity powdered cocaine that operates alongside a more expensive and far higher purity version of the drug			2
a line of the cheaper version can now be bought for just £ 2 – less than the price of a coffee			0
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years , figures from the @entity41 show the percentage of over- 35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 – the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women			1
over the same period , use among adults described as ‘ comfortably off ’ rose from 1.5 per cent to 1.9 per cent			0
overall just over 810,000 men and women aged 16 to 59 in @entity52 and @entity53 used the drug at least once last year – 2.4 per cent of the population			2
it is the highest rate in @entity57			0
use among older adults has been less common , particularly among 45 - 54 year olds			1
in 2013 - 14 , 1.8 per cent of people aged 34 - 44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier			1
among 45 - 54 - year - olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent			1
but the report said : ' it is notable that there have been statistically significant increases ( 1996 to 2013 - 14 ) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years ; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types			1
' it could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life , but the data suggests it is the result of ' continued use among an ageing user cohort ' , suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up			1
the access to cheap cocaine - often mixed with harmful cutting agents - is ' highly likely ' to have driven the rise in the number of users from ' hard pressed ' or low income backgrounds , as well as the ' comfortably off ' , living outside cities where drug use was traditionally uncommon			2
the report , addressed to home secretary @entity91 and health secretary @entity92 , is the first of its kind to investigate powdered cocaine use and was launched in response to fears of a perception that the drug is safe as use increased			2
cocaine use has trebled in two decades , although the proportion of people saying they have used drugs in the last year has fallen sharply professor @entity105 , chair of the @entity27 , an independent body which advises the government , said : ' consumption of powdered cocaine in the @entity1 has changed radically over the last two decades			1
' once characterised as the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities , the research highlighted in this report shows a cheaper , low - purity version of the drug has permeated society far more widely			1
cocaine use has now become ' firmly embedded ' in @entity1 society ' given the clear health risks associated with even infrequent cocaine use , and associated issues such as dependency and crime , this development has posed a huge challenge to health professionals , law enforcement , educators and academics			1
' he added : ' i believe the drug is firmly embedded in @entity1 society			1
' using data from the @entity134 , the report said 0.6 per cent of 16 - 59 year - olds took powdered cocaine in 1996 , compared to a peak of 3 per cent - or 885,000 people - in 2008 - 09			1
while the report said a slight fall in use since 2009 - to 743,000 people in 2013/2014 - could be a sign of a general decline in the @entity1 , mr @entity105 said it is not yet significant			1
despite the rise @entity144 , one of the authors of the report , said only a small minority of people use cocaine and warned against launching an anti-cocaine education campaign			2
' i think we need to tread carefully around drugs education and prevention because it can backfire , ' he said			0
' one of my worries is that if people think everyone is doing it then they might think it 's ok to do it			0
' the drug can cause significant harm even in first - time or occasional users , including strokes , heart attacks , over-heating of body temperature to life threatening levels and psychiatric problems			2
health problems are also caused by cutting agents used to make the drug more profitable - including levamisole used to worm sheep - which can lower blood cell numbers and phenacetin which can cause kidney problems			2
the report also found in the last year cocaine use was also found to be more than twice as popular among gays and bisexuals compared to heterosexuals			2
a @entity188 spokesman said the department ' continues to be concerned about the harms caused by cocaine use , which is why it is a @entity192 drug '			0
' there are positive signs our approach to this drug is working : the use of powder cocaine has fallen since a peak in 2008/2009 and there is a long - term downward trend in overall drug use , ' he said			2
' law enforcement continues to tackle the supply of cocaine at home and abroad and the @entity208 has introduced new powers to combat the trade in cutting agents , which are mixed with drugs by criminals to boost their profits			0
' we are grateful to the @entity27 for its review and recommendations on the use , prevalence and harms associated with powder cocaine			0
we will consider its advice carefully and respond in due course			0
' dr @entity225 , consultant psychiatrist at the @entity226 in @entity227 , @entity228 , said : ‘ people want an instant antidepressant , and they think cocaine is it , but it absolutely is n’t			0
we see lives totally wrecked by it			0
’ a multi-millionaire businessman ’s 40 - year marriage was destroyed by his £ 6,000 - a - week cocaine addiction which started in middle age , a high court judge said yesterday			1
the 62 - year - old grandfather , who has not been named , is likely to die if he does not kick his habit , mr @entity239 warned during a divorce settlement hearing			1
the judge described how the man , worth £ 25million , risked throwing everything away after being introduced to the class a drug eight years ago , as his addiction led to ‘ reckless and wanton ’ spending on cocaine and prostitutes			0
after leaving school without qualifications the man built his property maintenance company from scratch , which now has a turnover of £ 24million a year , and lived with his wife in a £ 2.3million home with an indoor swimming pool			0
the couple own two villas on the @entity264 , a fleet of luxury cars including two @entity267 , two @entity268 and a @entity269 , and enjoyed £ 60,000 holidays in @entity271			0
but the childhood sweethearts , who married in 1972 and have four children and several grandchildren , finally separated in may 2012 because of his drug abuse			0
the husband has spent £ 230,000 on rehab in the @entity279 and @entity280 but each time he relapsed after returning to the @entity1 , the court heard			0
mr @entity239 said : ‘ there is no doubt that the effect has been disastrous both for his health and for the state of his otherwise entirely happy marriage			0
’ the judge added : ‘ whoever introduced him to cocaine in his early 50s deserves a very long prison sentence as that person has destroyed a 40 - year marriage			1
the husband has not been able to act on the advice of his treating professionals			0
if he does not , it will probably kill him			0
at the very least , it will cause his family yet more turmoil			0

cocaine no longer just ' the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities '
official report says the drug is now ' firmly embedded in @entity1 society '
percentage of 45 - 54 - year - olds taking drug doubles in a decade , study finds
data suggests it is result of ' continued use among an ageing user cohort '
it could mean that age does not lead to people giving up taking drugs
