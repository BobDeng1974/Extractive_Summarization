while most people accept this model , scientists still ca n't explain what happened inside this tiny point - called a singularity – or what came before it			1
now , two physicists have put forward a radical new model which suggests the @entity5 did n't take place - and that our universe has no beginning and no end			2
our universe , according to @entity1 's theories , is around 13.8 billion years old and formed from an infinitely small point during the @entity5 ( illustration pictured ) while most people accept this model , scientists still ca n't explain what happened inside this tiny point - called a singularity – or what came before it ' the math and the @entity30 itself break down because of the infinities , ' professor @entity27 at @entity28 , @entity26 told @entity33			1
' in other words , the theory predicts its own demise			0
it also does not explain where that initial state , came from			0
' to help solve this problem , the scientists combined general relativity , which describes the forces around us , with quantum mechanics , which governs small objects , according to a report by @entity47 in @entity48			1
they began with equations created by physicist @entity50 , who in the 1950s attempted to use quantum theory in place of classical equation to describe the shortest path between two points on a curved surface			2
the scientists began with equations created by physicist @entity50 ( left ) , who in the 1950s attempted to use quantum theory in place of classical equations			2
they then combined this with an equation by professor @entity65 at @entity66 ( right ) they then combined this with an equation by professor @entity65 at @entity66 , in @entity70 , which described a fluid of small particles that pervades space			0
this fluid is the quantum version of gravity , which has dubbed a graviton by @entity78 and co-author @entity79 at @entity80			0
they showed that unlike classical trajectories - which are paths of particles going into the future or past – the quantum particles can never meet or cross			1
' as far as we can see , since different points in the universe never actually converged in the past , it did not have a beginning , ' said professor @entity27			1
it will also not have an end … in other words , there is no singularity			0
' but if there was no @entity5 , what is the history of our universe ? ' the universe could have lasted forever , ' speculates professor @entity27			1
' it could have gone through cycles of being small and big			0
' or it could have been created much earlier			0
' the theory may also potentially explain the origin of dark matter and dark energy			2
' as far as we can see , since different points in the universe never actually converged in the past , it did not have a beginning , ' said professor @entity27			1
pictured is a star cluster that popular cosmology believes formed following the @entity5			0
the current research suggests stars such as this always existed these elusive substances constitute respectively about 25 per cent and 70 per cent of our universe			0
' we showed that a giant @entity125 of gravitons may have formed very early on , have lasted forever , and which accounts for both dark matter and dark energy , ' said professor @entity27			1
in the late 1990s , astronomers found that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due the presence of a dark energy			2
their model has the potential to explain it since the fluid creates constant outward force that expands space			1
and when the team set the mass of the graviton , they could make the density of their fluid the same as the universe 's observed density of dark matter			0
' it is satisfying to note that such straightforward corrections can potentially resolve so many issues at once			0
' professor @entity27 told @entity48 .			1

current physics ca n't explain what happened during the @entity5
the new theory combines general relativity with quantum mechanics
the equations found that quantum particles can never meet or cross
' since different points in the universe never actually converged in the past , it did not have a beginning , ' professor @entity27 told @entity33
the model also has the potential to explain dark energy since the quantum particles create a constant outward force that expands space
