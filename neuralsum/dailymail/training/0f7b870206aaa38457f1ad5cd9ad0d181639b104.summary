by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity3 political reporter and @entity4 former prime minister @entity5 said it would be ' bizarre ' to put @entity3 pensions at risk @entity5 has warned @entity3 that their country may not be able to afford the state pension if it opts for independence			1
the former prime minister said a @entity14 vote for independence would mean the loss of the ‘ pooling and sharing ’ of resources which help pay for retired people ’s benefits			1
mr @entity5 said he did not believe @entity3 first minister @entity21 ’s assertions that pensions would continue to be paid , pointing to questions over the value of @entity26 oil revenues in the coming years			1
speaking in @entity27 , @entity28 – at the launch of a campaign group , keep our @entity32 pensions – mr @entity5 said : ‘ we know when we look at the figures for pensions , we in @entity3 get a higher share of the @entity32 pension money			1
’ the @entity39 mp added that when benefits such as pensioners ’ credit , the winter fuel allowance and free tv licences are added to the state pension , @entity3 receive around £ 200 more on average a year than their @entity48 counterparts , amounting to £ 200million for north of the border			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ why does that happen ? it happens because we pool all of our resources as part of the @entity32			1
we have more needs [ in @entity3 ] and more pensioners , therefore we get more			0
’ mr @entity21 ’s @entity57 described mr @entity5 ’s comments as scaremongering			1
@entity60 , chief secretary to the treasury , announced yesterday that @entity61 is granting the @entity3 government the power to issue its own bonds			0
this will broaden the sources of financing available to the @entity3 government for capital investment			0
mr @entity60 said this demonstrates ‘ once again how @entity3 can grow and prosper within the @entity32 ’			1
mr @entity5 said last night : ‘ the @entity57 can not deny we face a higher bill in an independent @entity3 when we lose the pooling and sharing that happens across the @entity32			1
’ the @entity57 has pledged to continue paying the basic state pension at the current rate if there is a @entity14 vote in september			0
ministers would keep the ‘ triple - lock ’ guarantee to ensure pensions keep pace with earnings and rising costs for at least the first term of an independent parliament scots go to the polls to decide the country 's future in the @entity32 in september , with the @entity92 having already suggested independence could mean a reduction in the state pension age north of the border			1
first minister @entity21 is under pressure over pensions , the pound and whether an independent @entity3 could join the @entity100 mr @entity5 added : ‘ we have polling evidence that only 15 per cent of pensioners favour independence and indeed 61 per cent of all @entity3 people believe that pensioners north of the border should be paid from @entity32 and not @entity3 taxes			1
‘ we must keep the common @entity32 national insurance fund that we have contributed to and paid into all of our working lives			2
we have accrued rights to our pension from successive @entity32 governments			2
‘ these have to be honoured and continue to be honoured by the @entity32			2
‘ it is bizarre that we would put @entity3 pensions at risk at a time when pension spending in @entity3 is rising faster than in the rest of the @entity32			2
’ he continued : ‘ the number of over 60s in @entity3 will grow from the current 22per cent of the population to 32per cent by the year 2035			0
’ an expert commission would be established to consider the appropriate age threshold for pensions , with deputy first minister @entity127 having already suggested this could see people in @entity3 picking up their state pension earlier than those in the rest of the @entity32			1
mr @entity132 said : ‘ one fact is indisputable			0
the costs of meeting the needs of @entity3 pensioners will be higher in years to come			0
there is absolutely no doubt we are better off spreading the risks as part of the @entity141			0
’ mr @entity21 's @entity57 described mr @entity5 's comments as scaremongering a @entity92 spokeswoman said : ‘ @entity146 report published last week shows that individual pensions in @entity3 would be 6per cent to 8per cent cheaper compared to the rest of the @entity32			1
‘ @entity3 is better able to afford pension and welfare payments than the rest of the @entity32			2
social protection takes up a smaller share of our national output and our tax revenues than it does in the @entity32 as a whole			2
‘ the research also makes clear that the lower life expectancy in @entity3 means it would be fairer for people here if the increase in the pension age was postponed			0
indeed , the paper states that the optimal policy for @entity3 would be a state pension age relatively lower than the rest of the @entity32			0
‘ in the first year of an independent @entity3 , we will establish an independent commission to consider the appropriate pace of further change to the retirement age beyond 66 , taking account of @entity3 circumstances			0
‘ the commission would report to the @entity171 within the first two years of independence , allowing us to take decisions which best suit the needs of people in @entity3 nearing pensionable age			0
