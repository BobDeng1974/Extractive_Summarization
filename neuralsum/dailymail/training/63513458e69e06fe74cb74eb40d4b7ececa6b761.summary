@entity1 mps would be barred from voting on @entity3 issues under plans being drawn up by senior @entity5			1
@entity6 has joined @entity7 and @entity8 in offering new powers over tax , welfare and spending if @entity1 votes no to independence next week			2
but senior @entity5 say the ‘ devo - max ’ option would be ‘ untenable ’ unless it is accompanied by greater devolution for @entity16			1
at the time , his plans would have prevented @entity1 mps from voting on health , education and local government			1
he added when @entity1 wins the right to make more decisions following @entity35 's referendum , @entity16 will expect the same privileges under devo - max , they could also be barred from voting on critical issues such as the @entity39 and welfare reform			1
former @entity19 cabinet minister @entity18 , who is leading the campaign for reform , said an ‘ overwhelming majority ’ of @entity19 mps believe the ‘ lopsided ’ arrangements must change			1
he said : ‘ @entity1 got first - class devolution , @entity49 got second - class , @entity16 got none at all			1
' it meant @entity3 students going to @entity1 universities have had to pay whilst @entity1 students have gone free			0
‘ once @entity1 gets the right to make more decisions , @entity16 will expect the same powers			0
everything that falls to be decided in @entity1 by the @entity58 would be decided by the @entity59 in @entity16			0
’ fellow @entity19 @entity60 said further devolution to @entity1 would be ‘ intolerable ’ unless it were accompanied by a fairer deal for @entity16			2
mr @entity60 , mp for @entity63 and @entity64 , added : ‘ it ’s a particular problem in the north of @entity16 if @entity1 gets more tax powers			0
’ @entity68 yesterday would not comment on whether the rights of @entity1 mps could be restricted			2
ministers are thought to be reluctant to raise the prospect ahead of the vote			0
but a @entity75 source said some change was ‘ inevitable ’ .			0
