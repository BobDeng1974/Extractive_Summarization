a mother racked up £ 45,000 in debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online bingo while she was off work sick			1
@entity5 , 32 , would gamble for eight hours at a time and drained all the money she and her boyfriend had saved up together			1
her addiction became so bad that she began to have suicidal thoughts and turned to self harm after worrying about how she would ever escape the habit			1
' it 's a vicious cycle as when you win get the buzz to play again , and when you lose you just want to get your money back			2
' i just wanted to find a way to make myself stop and when my thoughts turned dark i knew i had to get help			0
' she first stumbled across bingo while watching the @entity32 when she was signed off sick from her job as a childcare worker in 2012			1
@entity35 was advertised with a bright , brash logo on the daytime television show , luring ms @entity5 in before she went on to use other sites too			1
' you can go on and do it in your own home in comfort and to begin with it 's not a big deal , ' she said			0
the mother - of - one would play for eight hours non-stop while she was signed off work sick ' i 'd been to bingo with friends in the past but not spent more than about £ 20			1
it had never been an issue before			0
' but they always let you win something to begin with or offer you free plays			0
in just over six months , i was £ 10,000 in debt			2
' ms @entity5 's online bingo habit quickly spiralled out of control , and the first thing she would turn to in the morning was her smartphone , where she could get her kick within seconds			1
she said : ' i would gamble from the second my family left in the morning until they came home at night , and when they were home i would sneak off to the bathroom and bedroom to play			0
' my partner would come home and comment that the house had n't been touched and it was because i 'd be sat on it all day , gambling			2
' for the first two years i put everything on credit cards			1
because i was off and suffering with stress , i do n't really remember it			0
i think i was just blocking out what was going on ' i know the difference between right and wrong so now i think what on earth was i doing			0
' the mother took out more credit cards , arranged more overdrafts on her bank account and began to dip into the family 's savings			1
' i 've ended up with five credit cards in total - one for £ 10,000 and the others all have around £ 5,000 on them , ' she said			1
' i 'd maxed them all out by the end of 2013 and then until the middle of 2014 i was using any cash i could get my hands on			2
' i managed to get a £ 1,600 overdraft on one of my accounts and i just spent it			2
' my partner and i were saving around £ 500 a month and i would just access the accounts and spend what i could			1
now we 're left without any savings at all			0
' eventually she came clean to her boyfriend @entity105 , 37 , and she started seeing a doctor to help her tackle her addiction			2
now ms @entity5 , who is paying off £ 300 of debt a month , is now calling on the gambling industry to rein in its adverts , which are aired on television throughout the day			1
ms @entity5 is now undergoing counselling after kicking the habit , and is paying back £ 300 a month to clear her debts she said : ' they target vulnerable people and make them believe they can make money from gambling			1
' i understand some people gamble and have no issues			0
but many people have a problem and this destroys lives , families and even drives people to suicide			0
' it destroys people and leaves them with long term debts , depression and stress			2
' no - one gives you anything for nothing in this world and something needs to be done about it			0
' @entity139 , ceo of gambling support charity @entity140 , said : ' we applaud people who come forward and admit that they have a problem with gambling			0
' we encourage people to get support either for themselves or for family members or friends who might be struggling			0
' there is help available out there either through support groups or through one - on - one counselling			0
' we know that women in particular are drawn to online forms of gambling and they are more likely to access these services online			1
' we offer an online chat service through our helping where people can anonymously come through and chat with one of our advisors			0
' it is a reality that people can get hooked on these websites , and people should be fully aware of the risks before getting too involved			0
' @entity35 have been contacted for comment .			1
