by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 11 february 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 11 february 2013 if you are one of the thousands of @entity3 planning to flip a pancake or two on @entity5 tomorrow then your work just got made a whole lot easier			1
. or harder , depending on your grasp of science			1
the formula for the perfect pancake mix has been revealed as 100 - [ @entity11 + c ( k - c ) + t ( m - t ) ] / ( @entity12 ) , and was developed by mathematicians at the @entity14			1
@entity15 unveiled the mathematical formula for the perfect pancake - claiming in the process to be able to eliminate sub-standard crepes across kitchens forever			1
pancake perfection ! 100 - [ @entity11 + c ( k - c ) + t ( m - t ) ] / ( @entity12 ) the science : the formula was developed by researchers at the @entity14 households all over the @entity3 will be flipping traditional pancakes in celebration of @entity28 tuesday - in most cases , resulting in lumpy batter and floor splatter			1
spokesperson for @entity37 explains : ‘ @entity38 represents the number of lumps in the batter and @entity42 equals its consistency			1
f stands for the flipping score , k is the ideal consistency and @entity34 is the temperature of the pan			1
‘ the perfect pan temperature is represented by m , @entity12 is the time the batter stands before cooking and @entity12 is the time the cooked pancake stands before being eaten - the closer to 100 the result is , the better the pancake			1
’ whether the formula will translate from paper to pancake pan is another matter entirely			1
@entity56 , founder of @entity58 ’s restaurant in @entity59 offers her four top flipping tips			1
worried your home made pancakes will turn out a flop ? tempted to leave it to the professionals ? do n't be the first to flip ! with @entity28 tuesday fast approaching this february , pancake aficionado @entity56 and her pastry team share some top tips for how to make the perfect pancakes this @entity28 tuesday			1
they certainly know what they 're talking about too			1
during the first weekend of the launch of their ' @entity76 ' in @entity78 , they knocked out over 300 pancakes before 10am			1
be prepared do n't be afraid to prep in advance			1
create your mix slowly with a generous pinch of rock salt the night before you plan to get flipping			2
your pancakes will definitely taste better			2
do n't go first use a heavy frying pan - it will help with the perfect flip action & wait until it 's hot , hot , hot			1
be warned , if you are in a competitive environment , the first one is always a disappointment			2
thin is the name of the game smooth , round edges & as thin as you dare is what you are aiming for			2
embrace your inner child slide straight out of the frying pan , smear with @entity101 & eat immediately			2
@entity102 ! shoppers in search of the perfect pancake have been stocking up on new equipment over the past week , with frying pan sales up by 50 per cent at @entity15 , in a bid to wow their friends and families with the perfect pancake toss			2
according to the results of a @entity15 survey , 86 per cent of households will be enjoying pancakes today , yet only 14 per cent of those surveyed are confident they know how to make , cook and flip the traditional @entity28 tuesday dessert			2
@entity37 continues : ‘ coupled with the right frying pan , following this formula will result in perfect pancakes all round ! ’ hooray ! remember the perfect amount of time between cooking and eating is 0 ‘ simplifying the science behind this formula , our customers can have perfect pancakes tonight			1
' the golden rules seem to be to have a good pan at 377 degrees , have zero lumps in the mixture , and leave the batter to stand for 30 minutes before cooking , making sure the pancakes are eaten straight away – that seems simple enough			2
‘ once victim to overzealous pancake tossers , floors and ceilings will be free from mess this year ! ’ regional survey results showed that those in @entity143 and @entity144 were the shyest about their pancake skills , with only 4 per cent believing they would be flipping successfully			2
meanwhile , in the @entity148 , 23 per cent of respondents were sure they had pancake tossing nailed and would be enjoying their pancakes triumphantly this evening			2
the survey also found that tde most popular type of pancake filling is still the traditional lemon and sugar combination , with 56 per cent opting for this as their filling of choice			2
do email photographs of your funniest pancake fails , feedback or tales of the unexpected to femail@mailonline.co.uk and we will publish the best on wednesday			2
the brain child of @entity168 of @entity169 , the ' @entity170 ' uses @entity171 instead of @entity172 to give the classic @entity173 a tasty face - lift			1
why not give them a try yourself using the formula for pancake perfection ? remember when to watch out for lumps in your batter ! for the crepes : for the sauce : 1			1
sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets an airing			0
now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it			0
then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so			1
next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture , still whisking ( do n’t worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk )			0
when all the liquid has been added , use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre , then whisk once more until the batter is smooth , with the consistency of thin cream			0
now melt the 50g of butter in a pan			0
@entity221 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in , then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan , using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake			0
stir the orange zest and caster sugar into the batter			0
delicious : @entity170 ready to eat 3			0
now get the pan really hot , then turn the heat down to medium and , to start with , do a test pancake to see if you ’re using the correct amount of batter			0
these little crêpes should be thinner than the basic pancakes , so when you ’re making them , use ½ tbsp of batter at a time in a 18cm pan			0
it ’s also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go			0
as soon as the batter hits the hot pan , tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter			0
it should take only half a minute or so to cook ; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it ’s tinged gold as it should be			0
the perfect pan : the new @entity267 @entity266 pancake pan , available at @entity268 , £ 30 4 flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate			1
if the pancakes look a little bit ragged in the pan , no matter because they are going to be folded anyway			0
you should end up with 15 - 16 crêpes			1
stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water , to keep them warm while you make the rest			0
for the sauce , mix all the ingredients - with the exception of the butter - in a bowl			1
at the same time warm the plates on which the crêpes are going to be served			0
now melt the butter in the frying pan , pour in the sauce and allow it to heat very gently			0
then place the first crêpes in the pan and give it time to warm through before folding it in half and then in half again to make a triangular shape			0
slide this onto the very edge of the pan , tilt the pan slightly so the sauce runs back into the centre , then add the next crêpe			0
continue like this until they ’re all re-heated , folded and well soaked with the sauce			0
you can flame them at this point if you like			0
heat a ladle by holding it over a gas flame or by resting it on the edge of a hotplate , then , away from the heat , pour a little @entity171 into it , return it to the heat to warm the spirit , then set light to it			0
carry the flaming ladle to the table over the pan and pour the flames over the crêpes before serving on the warmed plates			0
