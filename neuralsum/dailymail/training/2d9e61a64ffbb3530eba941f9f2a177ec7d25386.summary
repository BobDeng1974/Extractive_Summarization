‘ as i look back , i just think my goodness - when i first had him there were no motorways , all the railways were steam and the @entity63 was n’t even on the throne			0
‘ it makes you realise just how old he is			0
’ it is believed the endangered animal - which could be worth thousands of pounds - was snatched by opportunistic metal thieves as they scoured the area for property to steal			1
