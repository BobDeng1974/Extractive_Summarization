by @entity0 cheesy festive songs are a @entity3 staple ... but what about a block of cheddar that tastes like turkey and all the trimmings ? that ’s exactly what you could be spreading on crackers or grilling on toast after a chef created the world ’s first @entity3 dinner cheese			1
the unique cheddar contains turkey flavouring as well as whole sprouts , pieces of carrot and festive fruit			1
@entity3 dinner is served : the cheese contains turkey flavouring with added carrots and sprouts pudding cheese : the cheddar contains brandy - soaked sultanas , raisins , currants , candied cherries , apple , cinnamon and a special @entity3 liqueur there ’s also a @entity3 pudding cheese with brandy - soaked sultanas , raisins and currants , candied cherries and apple , cinnamon and liqueur			1
the idea for the festive cheeses came from chef and product developer at the @entity52 cheddar company , @entity53 , 31			1
‘ we wanted to give the nation something really special and unique for @entity3 which brought together two of our favourite foods – @entity3 dinner and cheddar , ’ she said			2
‘ so i worked to combine the two			0
we ’ve done the same thing with @entity3 pudding – because you ca n’t have @entity3 without a bit of @entity3 pudding			1
‘ the best bit about it , is that now you can have @entity3 dinner on toast			2
‘ it means i can have @entity3 dinner whenever and as often as i like without all the hard work and hassle that usually comes with it			0
’ both festive cheeses are available in limited quantities from the company on request			0
last @entity3 , lazy chefs were given a quick alternative to cooking in the form of a self - heating dinner in a can			0
including all the usual trimmings , the @entity85 just required cooks to peel back the lid and pierce the sachet , which triggered a natural heat - producing reaction			0
@entity3 on toast anyone ? you could keep enjoying a festive feast after the big day with just a slice			0
