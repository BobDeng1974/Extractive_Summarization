if @entity1 made a comeback as a defender , he would be an all - action @entity4 with electric hair , have 6.5million @entity7 followers and call them all ‘ geezers ’			2
the new comic book star would score a magnificent booming header against his former team , celebrate with a screaming knee slide , scrap with the evil baddie of the opposition ( @entity16 ) and finish the struggle victorious , shaking hands with the ground staff before exiting for his next adventure			2
the problem for the script writers , if they were to copy the life and times of @entity24 , is that they would have no idea what @entity24 was going to do next , so what chance do the opposition – or his team - mates – have ? @entity24 jumps for joy after his bullet header forced the game in to extra-time on wednesday night @entity24 celebrates victory with team - mates @entity38 ( right ) and @entity39 at the final whistle when you expect @entity24 to be heading it clear , he ’s chasing the glory , when you expect him to be chasing the glory , he appears from nowhere to head it clear			1
losing 7 - 0 in a @entity47 semi-final , he still thinks he can get a goal back			0
who knows ? a hat - trick			0
on that occasion it finished 7 - 1 and the one - man reconnaissance mission broke down , leaving gaps behind him for the @entity57 team to exploit			0
would it change his approach ? of course not			0
even on wednesday night , with @entity63 drawing 2 - 2 at @entity64 with minutes remaining and set to go through with 10 men on away goals , he turned up on the right wing to collect the ball and retain possession			1
@entity24 looks on in disgust as @entity71 celebrate one of their seven goals in last summer 's @entity47 semi-final he ’s a defender who sees defending as a part - time job			1
so concerned was @entity77 , a @entity47 - winning centre back with 97 caps , which suggests he knows a bit about defending , that he played @entity24 in midfield in the first leg , with two centre backs behind him for cover			1
he was back in the back four for the second leg and , when it works , it works spectacularly			0
who else could have got them through when their talisman , @entity89 , had been sent off ? @entity24 could have been sent off too for his feuding with @entity16 , but instead he rose majestically in the land of the giants that is @entity64 ’s penalty area to send a thunderball of a header into the roof of the net			1
the defender stumble backwards after one of many confrontations with @entity16 on wednesday night to get ahead of @entity102 , @entity103 or his marker @entity105 takes great skill , movement and courage but to meet the ball with such ferocity … maybe there ’s more to @entity24 than his @entity112 nickname and carefree style			1
not just a former player quietly enjoying the moment against the club that sold him , but a full - pelt emotional surge of joy			0
he said he would n’t celebrate on his first return to @entity122 , but who can blame him for loving the moment ? it was a goal worth celebrating			1
@entity64 sold him because they thought the deal was too good to refuse and , presumably , because they thought @entity102 and @entity103 could do the job better			2
few can argue with that – @entity102 , especially , has been magnificent as a defender this season but can he hit a dipping , swerving free kick , @entity135 style , from more than 30 yards , as @entity24 did on wednesday night ? @entity136 has a word with @entity24 on the touchline as @entity63 manager @entity77 watches on @entity24 rises to beat @entity105 to @entity38 's corner and head home @entity63 's equaliser not everyone is a @entity24 fan – @entity143 wrote on this website that ‘ whoever struck the deal to sell @entity24 for £ 50m deserves a knighthood ’			1
and , as chief sports writer @entity148 reported , @entity136 thought @entity24 was too much of an optimist as a defender			2
@entity148 wrote : ‘ @entity136 wanted miseries at the back			0
he wanted players who feared the roof was about to fall in , the move was going to break down , a counter attack was only a stray pass away			0
@entity24 was n’t like that			2
he roamed , he left gaps , he charged upfield and if that break went wrong he thought it would n’t matter			0
he did n’t check for danger , he was rarely alarmed			0
@entity24 was too much of an optimist to defend properly			2
’ the optimist will make mistakes			0
he will raid upfield when he should be focussing on shutting the door , but he had a lot of fun at @entity122 on wednesday night and he ’s still in the @entity168			1
@entity24 has a moment of reflection as @entity63 progress to the quarter - finals of the @entity168			1

@entity24 starred as @entity63 knocked @entity64 out of the @entity168
@entity24 scored late equaliser with a bullet header to force game into extra-time
@entity64 *sanctioned* the £ *50million* sale of @entity24 to @entity63 last summer
@entity24 celebrated wildly despite playing at his former @entity122 home
