@entity0 : @entity1 and @entity2 investigated by @entity3 over ' sexist , racist and homophobic ' text messages during time at @entity5 @entity6 have lost their back - of - shirt sponsor @entity8 following the controversial appointment of manager @entity1			1
the local kitchen firm , which carries a logo on the back of the @entity14 's kit , said that it had been left in an ' untenable position '			1
and , on thursday night , another sponsor @entity16 also severed their ties with the @entity14 club			1
despite an ongoing @entity3 investigation into a series of racist , sexist and homophobic texts exposed by @entity22 , @entity1 has been handed another chance in management 11 months after leaving @entity5			1
i 've apologised for my mistakes i 've studied diversity and that 's something that 's ongoing			0
' it has been a difficult period and i have made mistakes			0
i hope that in my time at @entity6 , the people of @entity6 and the supporters see who i am and see that i 'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well			1
' @entity8 only started their sponsorship deal with the @entity52 in july , after formerly being associated with @entity53			1
the partnership was the first time that @entity6 have carried a back of shirt sponsor in their history - with the @entity61 based firm 's website appearing above players ' names			1
at the time , @entity64 , director at @entity8 said : ' we think it ’s very important for local businesses to support local teams as it can only add to the fabulous sense of community already surrounding a great side			1
' @entity1 , who was confirmed as the new manager of @entity6 on wednesday , will be hoping his side can bounce back from two consecutive defeats on saturday			1
a statement from @entity16 released on thursday said : ' @entity16 is passionate about supporting professional football and in particular @entity14 football			2
in fact , @entity16 is the stadium sponsor to @entity80 and hydration partner to over half the clubs in the @entity83 supplying all natural isotonic sports performance drinks to a large number of teams			2
' the company has been a supporter of the team and fan base at @entity91 and had looked forward to a long and fruitful relationship with the club as its hydration partner			0
however , the recent decision to appoint @entity1 as the club 's new manager in the light of the @entity3 's investigation into racist , sexist and homophobic text messages that he apparently sent while manager at @entity5 , is at odds with the company 's business ethics and commitment to best practice			1
' @entity16 actively encourages positive working relationships that are not based on colour , race , nationality , religious belief , sexual orientation or age and can not condone racism , sexism or homophobia			2
as a result , it is with deep regret that @entity16 will be severing its relationship with @entity6			1
' @entity6 chairman @entity29 revealed @entity1 ’s rolling contract includes a clause that protects the club in case the @entity3 end up punishing their new manager			1
the @entity3 investigation is still two or three weeks away from completion and while disciplinary officials have to decide whether to differentiate between public and private communication , the most senior officials at @entity130 want to see action taken			2
at the same time , a @entity5 investigation into eight transfers completed during @entity1 ’s tenure is also ongoing			1
@entity1 keeps a close eye on training as he takes charge of first session since his appointment at the unveiling @entity29 said : ‘ we have spoken to the @entity3			1
i do n’t think there is anything in the pipeline with the investigation but it ’s in the contract ( with @entity1 ) , we are protecting the club			1
‘ i did ask @entity151 questions about the problems he ’s had on the racist thing			0
he admits what he did and apologised for what he said			0
‘ i think @entity151 has been so unlucky			0
he has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it			0
it ’s not like we are all saints			0
’ in one of the texts , @entity1 , 42 , described his former @entity5 owner @entity162 as ‘ a chink ’ and others referred to women , @entity166 and ethnic minorities in extremely derogatory terms			1
there 's enough dogs in @entity5 for us all to go around			2
' on the arrival of @entity176 international @entity175 ' go on , fat @entity177 like a jew that sees money slipping through his fingers ' on football agent @entity183 ' he 's a snake , a gay snake			0
not to be trusted ' on an official of another club ' not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering			0
' on a list of potential signings ' i hope she 's looking after your needs			0
i bet you 'd love a bounce on her falsies			0
' on a player 's female agent a picture entitled @entity202 ( where every square was a " @entity205 " square ) sent to members of @entity5 's staff as @entity1 was being unveiled in the @entity208 , anti-racism organisation @entity210 criticised @entity6 ’s appointment , saying : ‘ @entity6 have disregarded the ongoing investigation being undertaken by the @entity3 , and any potential punishment @entity1 may face , by taking the decision to appoint him			1
‘ we need to see leadership and a respect for the processes in place shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion , prejudice and discrimination			0
’ coincidentally , kick it out staged an equality and diversity session for @entity6 ’s apprentices yesterday			2
local mp @entity230 had previously written to @entity29 asking him not to consider @entity1 as a replacement for @entity232 , who was sacked a week ago			2
we wish to make it clear the @entity3 investigation into the conduct of @entity1 and @entity2 remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the @entity3 as to the outcome of this case			1
in the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case , the @entity3 would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation			2
the @entity3 did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-october			2
this came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information			0
the @entity3 is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place			0
this process inevitably takes time			0
both mr @entity1 and mr @entity2 are fully co-operating with the ongoing process			0
we fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter			0
however , it remains a complex investigation and the @entity3 will make no further comment at this time .			0
