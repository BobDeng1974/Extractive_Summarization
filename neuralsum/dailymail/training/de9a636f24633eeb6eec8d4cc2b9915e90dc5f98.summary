a man in @entity1 reportedly killed his mother before going after his two young nieces thursday morning in a brutal attack			1
@entity5 from @entity6 , a paranoid schizophrenic who was on drugs at the time according to one family member , is suspected of killing his mother @entity11 , an amputee with no legs , in their home , attacking two of his nieces with a blunt weapon and was in the process of attacking a third child when his father @entity21 came upon him , dragging the boy outside as police were called			1
the girls are at @entity25 in @entity26 where 9 - year - old @entity27 is in serious condition and 7 - year - old @entity29 is in stable condition			1
this led to a three hour standoff , as a swat team was called in and tried to convince @entity5 to come outside , unsure if there were individuals in the house being held hostage			1
during this time authorities also evacuated other houses in the area to ensure the safety of residents , and got the children out of the @entity59 home , where mrs. @entity60 was pronounced dead on the scene			0
when reasoning with @entity5 proved to be ineffective , a @entity62 was used to take out one of the walls in the home and deploy tear gas and flash bang devices , at which point @entity5 stumbled out with one hand in his pocket			1
officers believe he may have done so in hopes of being shot dead , but not one member of the swat team even fired at the troubled young man			1
as he was making his way out he ran into one of the @entity40 vehicles and ended up knocking himself out , and was taken from the scene on a stretcher			0
@entity5 ( above ) finally fled the home after tear gas was released inside and is now in custody @entity5 was taken away on a stretcher following the standoff ( above ) @entity88 sheriff @entity87 called it ' a horrific situation			1
' there were two other young boys , ages 13 and 4 , at the home that morning , who were unharmed			2
@entity21 , the grandfather to the two girls , was about to take them to school for the day			0
@entity5 also had cuts on his neck , stomach and head that were likely self - inflected , and which cops believe he did using a drill bit			1
meanwhile , the scene back at the home where the brutal attack took place was so bad , @entity87 had crisis counseling on site for everyone			0
one of @entity5 ' nephews , who was in the house during the attack , wrote on @entity113 thursday afternoon ; ' i love you grandma			1
i hope everythings good in heaven ik @entity119 didnt mean he was on drugs its not his fault i just wan na say i love you grandma and let just hope that the girls make it i love you all i love you to jason ik you didnt mean it ima miss you all i love you guys			0
' @entity5 ' condition is not clear at this time , and he is in police custody			2
' if our community can rally prayers for these young girls and their families , they need them , ' said @entity87			2
meanwhile , friends of @entity5 are shocked with what happened thursday			2
that 's not what @entity119 would 've done , ' childhood friend @entity139 told the @entity142			0
' he 's always had my brother 's and my back			0
he was a caring person			0
i do n't know how to explain other than that			0
' @entity5 faces one charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder , the sheriff â€™s office said .			0
