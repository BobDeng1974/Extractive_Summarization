by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 9 october 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 9 october 2013 the first evidence of a comet impact on @entity3 has been found in a mysterious black @entity5 pebble filled with diamonds			1
the comet is thought to have struck @entity3 28 million years heating the sands of the @entity10 desert to 2,000 ° @entity11 it created huge amounts of yellow silica glass - also known as @entity16 desert glass - which today lie scattered over a 6 000 square kilometre area in the @entity10			1
the comet is thought to have struck @entity3 28 million years heating the sands of the @entity10 desert to 2,000 ° c a magnificent specimen of the glass , polished by ancient jewellers , is found in @entity23 's brooch with its striking yellow - brown scarab			1
the discovery reported in @entity3 and @entity26 could even help researchers unlock the secrets of the formation of our solar system			0
‘ @entity35 always visit our skies – they ’re these dirty snowballs of ice mixed with dust – but never before in history has material from a comet ever been found on @entity3 , ’ said professor @entity32 of @entity33 , who led the research			1
as well as the glass , the impact produced microscopic diamonds			2
the comet created huge amounts of yellow silica glass - also known as @entity16 desert glass - which today lie scattered over a 6 000 square kilometre area in the @entity10 @entity23 's impeccably preserved brooch was recovered along with the numerous other artifacts within his tomb in 1922			1
the striking yellow - brown scarab that is set at its heart is made of a yellow silica glass stone procured from the sand of the @entity10			1
researchers believe the silica glass was originally formed 28 million years ago , when an ancient comet entered the earth 's atmosphere and exploded over @entity5			1
evidence of this can be found in a small , black , diamond - bearing pebble found years earlier by an @entity5 geologist			2
after conducting chemical analyses on the pebble , the authors came to the conclusion that it represented the very first known hand specimen of a comet nucleus , rather than an unusual type of meteorite			2
the team have named the diamond - bearing pebble ‘ @entity79 ’ after of the first well known female mathematician , astronomer and philosopher , @entity79			0
understanding how a comet impact affects planets , could scientists solve some of the mysteries surrounding our solar system			2
@entity86 describes the find as a moment elation			0
‘ it ’s a typical scientific euphoria when you eliminate all other options and come to the realisation of what it must be , ’ he said			0
comet material is very elusive			0
fragments have never been found on @entity3 before except as microscopic sized dust particles in the upper atmosphere and some carbon - rich dust in the @entity101 ice			0
‘ @entity103 and @entity104 spend billions of dollars collecting a few micrograms of comet material and bringing it back to @entity3 , and now we ’ve got a radical new approach of studying this material , without spending billions of dollars collecting it , ’ said @entity102			0
the study of @entity79 has grown into an international collaborative research programme with several expeditions already underway in the desert glass area			1
the team have named the diamond - bearing pebble @entity79 after of the first well known female mathematician , astronomer and philosopher , @entity79 ( pictured )			0

clues of the impact were also found in @entity16 desert glass in the @entity10
glass was created after comet heated the sands of the desert to 2,000 ° c
a magnificent specimen of the glass can be found in @entity23 's brooch
