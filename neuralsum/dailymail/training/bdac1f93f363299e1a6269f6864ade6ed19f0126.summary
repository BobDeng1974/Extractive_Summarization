one person complained that the two adverts were socially irresponsible by trivialising the nature of taking out a secured loan on your vehicle			0
the @entity11 subsequently banned the adverts , saying they must not be broadcast again in their current form			2
describng the reasons for the ban , it stated : ' we noted the jingle used in both ads was catchy and upbeat , that it was likely to be recognised by many viewers as the tune of ' for he 's a jolly good fellow ' , and that during both ads , men and women were seen dressed up in lederhosen dancing , singing and smiling while both drivers were handed a wad of bank notes			2
' light - hearted : throughout the adverts men are handed wads of money as jovial music is played and a voiceover says money can be borrowed against the value of a car the @entity11 added : ' we considered that the overall atmosphere of both ads was jolly , light - hearted and humorous , in contrast to the serious nature of the business of taking out a loan			1
' ' we noted that the ads explained the men needed a loan to help with a financial shortfall , portrayed taking out credit as a one - off and stated explicitly that loans were subject to proof of income , but due to the celebratory atmosphere of the ads and the lack of emphasis on the potential consequences of taking out a loan , we felt the ads trivialised and presented a casual attitude to taking out a loan , ' they said			1
the @entity11 said it told @entity224 to ensure all future advertising complied with the relevant consumer credit legislation and was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society			0
' bosses at @entity224 admitted the apr should have been given greater prominence , but insisted it was a cheaper rate than other providers			0
they agreed that the adverts were ' light - hearted and humorous ' but said that was to help consumers familiarise themselves with the @entity35 brand			1
the added that the ads ' reflected real - life situations that loans 2 @entity35 said their customers faced , and the ads were pitched in that context ' and that they did not ' trivialize the nature of taking out a loan ' .			1
