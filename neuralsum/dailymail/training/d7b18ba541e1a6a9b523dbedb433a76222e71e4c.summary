after missing yesterday 's engagements due to a sinus problem , the @entity0 pulled out all the stops to look her very best as she and prince @entity4 continued their royal tour of @entity7			1
but @entity8 was left blushing for all the wrong reasons when she turned up in a stunning creme ensemble - which was almost identical to her host 's outfit			1
standing beside @entity15 , the @entity16 of @entity17 , the pair looked the mirror image of one another , as they made their way around the industrial city in northern @entity7			2
the duo wore a matching string of pearls and discreet pearl - coloured earrings to complete their outfits			1
the outfit faux pas took place on the final day of @entity4 and the @entity0 's trip to @entity7			1
for her last day , the duchess left her chauffeur driven car behind - and hopped onto a @entity38 bus			2
@entity8 boarded the red routemaster during the visit to the northern city , before quipping ' are we going to zoo ? ' seeing a @entity38 bus under grey skies after a downpour , the duchess probably felt the city was a home from home			1
the number 7 bus - emblazoned with the route @entity38 to @entity17 - took her a short distance across @entity73 , built on the site of industrial works and now home to a museum showcasing the heavy industry of the area			0
they stepped off at a canal in the park and took a pleasure cruise around a series of waterways which featured cultural performances of dances and musicians along its route			0
at one point when they hit choppy waters @entity8 pulled a face as if a little concerned			2
the routemaster was restored to its former glory by plastic surgeon @entity97 , 50 , who bought it for his artist wife @entity99 , 49 , to use as a mobile gallery			0
the outfit faux pas took place during the last day of @entity4 and the @entity0 's trip to @entity7 when @entity8 boarded a red routemaster bus he said : ' this is the first time the bus has been used and it was used to take @entity8 on a trip - so that 's a nice way to begin			1
' @entity8 sat on a makeshift seat in the bus built in 1948 , as all the rest had been removed to make the routemaster into a mobile gallery			2
mr @entity97 bought and restored the @entity38 bus for around 125,000 @entity116 dollars ( Â£ 100,000 ) just over three years ago and spent the last two having it rebuilt			0
he said : ' my wife found it on the internet it was in @entity124 , it was taken from @entity38 in the late 1960s and it was originally owned by the man who bought @entity126			0
' he did n't want it any more and sold it to someone else and that person sold it to us			0
' the @entity0 also took a guided tour via canal boat with her host the duchess waved enthusiastically to those waiting to catch a glimpse of the royal visitor but she appeared to find parts of the trip somewhat unnerving , as shown by her concerned expression when @entity8 first arrived with @entity4 at the industrial museum they were greeted by a group of performers , @entity144 , who wore traditional costumes from the state - @entity149 hats and tasselled jackets for the men and long flowing skirts for the women			1
inside a former steel foundry the royal couple saw displays showcasing local produce , dishes and crafts , from ornately decorated saddles to a traditional breakfast meal of eggs , dried beef , and onion			1
the governor of the local state of @entity50 welcomed the prince and duchess in a speech and @entity4 spoke a few words in @entity172 in return : ' thank you for your kind welcome , governor			0
my wife and i are delighted to be here in @entity50 for the first time , on the final day of our visit to @entity7			1
' the pair watched the @entity144 at the @entity73 in @entity17 the matching women were joined by the @entity185 to view a market exhibition the market showed regional culinary traditions - which prince @entity4 appeared to enjoy getting stuck into as @entity4 and @entity8 's four - day tour of @entity7 came to a close , @entity189 , @entity190 's ambassador to @entity7 , said the royal couple had been well received			1
he said : ' the crowds of people we saw in all the regions we visited prove that there is real affection for their royal highnesses here in @entity7			2
' they have visited iconic places that represent the rich diversity of this country but they have also taken so much time to meet members of the community			0
' i am confident that this royal visit will give a significant boost to the relationship between our countries			2
a historical relationship that has been characterised by mutual respect , co-operation and friendship			0
' the royal couple went on to meet local children , who waved @entity221 flags excitedly @entity189 , @entity190 's ambassador to @entity7 , said the royal couple had been well received in the country no doubt their lasting impression had something to do with the @entity185 showing off his fancy footwork a day earlier , when he delighted groups of locals with a spot of traditional dancing			1
@entity4 did n't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of @entity235 on @entity7 's @entity237 coast			1
twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him , a beaming @entity185 deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance , known locally as a @entity246			0
the @entity185 had the @entity7 town of @entity235 in a spin when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined locals for a dance the @entity185 tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance , known locally as a @entity246 @entity4 ' close encounter with mr @entity254 and his troupe of dancers came as he visited @entity235 's main town square , where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries			2
the large crowds waiting to see @entity4 were being entertained by the dance troupe , who were dressed in traditional costumes , when the royal arrived and joined in the dance			0
delighted , the crowd roared their approval before the @entity185 gave one final twirl and moved on , looking thrilled but more than a little relieved			0
the @entity0 had been unable to who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple 's @entity7 tour because of a sinus problem			1
clearly unhappy to be without her , prince @entity4 offered a brief comment on the health of his , pointing to his ear and saying : ' @entity277 , such bad luck '			0
@entity4 laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance came to an end @entity4 earned the praise of dancer @entity254 , 20 , who joined in to help the @entity185 along			0
