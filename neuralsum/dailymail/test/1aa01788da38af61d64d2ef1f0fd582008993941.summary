the season that brings with it ' the sweet smell of different flowers in odor and in hue '			0
try telling that to apparent cold - blooded @entity10 stars @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , who chose to pull on their woolies for april 's blockbuster @entity18 derby in front of an unforgiving @entity21 crowd ; unusually late for this time of year			1
admittedly temperatures in the north west on sunday afternoon were not exactly soaring - hitting between six and eight degrees @entity24 by the time of the 4pm kick off - but was it enough to wear gloves while competing as a top athlete for 90 minutes ? probably not			2
@entity11 ( left ) was one of four players in the @entity18 derby who chose to wear gloves at @entity21 after another below - par game @entity11 was described by @entity33 as a ' weed ' in @entity10 's garden glove - wearing @entity12 opened the scoring on derby day it was a far from blossoming performance for the visitors as well , and like autumn leaves @entity10 fell embarrassingly to their local rivals			1
after a less - than - warm welcome and despite springing first at @entity21 following an early strike from @entity12 , @entity10 lacked the killer edge to overcome their adversaries			1
this time of year is notorious for exposing a plague of unwanted weeds in the garden , and @entity33 knew this all too well after the clash saw his former enemies lose for the fourth time in six @entity55 matches			0
@entity14 looked shaky again in the @entity10 defence but at least his hands stayed warm @entity58 defender @entity13 ( right ) slides in on @entity59 during the fierce encounter outlook : @entity62			2
wind : 14 mph humidity : â†‘ 93 % temperature : 43 ( @entity66 ) ' there are some weeds in the garden and you 've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick , ' @entity33 said of the @entity10 players - particularly @entity11 - in his post-match analysis			1
' you can not carry passengers			0
' goals from @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 made sure under - fire boss @entity82 would be thinking about preparing his weed killer by the end of the night			0
but it was n't only the @entity10 quartet who needed the warmth ... fourth official at @entity21 , @entity90 , was also sporting a pair of hand warmers whilst introducing both sets of substitutes on sunday			1
however , we 'll let him off , he was only watching			0
fourth official @entity90 was also among those to wrap up warm at @entity21			0

four @entity10 stars pull on the gloves for spring derby showdown
no @entity104 players chose to take such *drastic* measures
