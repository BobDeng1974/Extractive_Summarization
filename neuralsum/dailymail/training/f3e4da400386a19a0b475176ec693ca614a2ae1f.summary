with the @entity1 fast approaching , many are predicting another victory for the @entity3 - favourites after winning five of the last six tournaments			1
but perhaps fans should n't be getting too comfortable			0
here , @entity9 's @entity8 gives five reasons the @entity12 team should n't be written off			1
1 @entity14 factor while he is unquestionably a great player it is doubtful whether @entity14 ’s presence has been a good thing for the team with his aura and the distractions he brings			2
was it a coincidence that the last time the @entity12 won was in 2008 when @entity14 was absent through injury ? @entity14 not playing possibly changes the team dynamic for the better			1
the absence of @entity14 could prove a blessing for the @entity12 , who have not won since 2008 2 close encounters while the @entity3 have had much the better of it since 1985 the last two matches could have gone either way — both finishing 14½ - 13½ to @entity3			1
at @entity34 in 2010 the @entity12 had a good run at eradicating a three - point deficit while at @entity38 in 2012 the match was stolen from them by a @entity3 ‘ miracle ’ after they had led 10 - 6			1
3 men on a mission when @entity43 announced his captain ’s picks it was notable how often the word ‘ redemption ’ was used			2
the result from @entity38 has haunted the players involved and there is a real sense of them being on a mission to make amends as their ‘ @entity55 ’ motto suggests			2
@entity12 captain @entity43 says they are out to avenge @entity38 at this year 's @entity1 4 home comforts the weekend weather forecast suggests that the temperatures will not be that hostile to the visitors and there are aspects of the @entity64 , designed by @entity65 , which are not totally foreign either			1
it lies inland , has large man - made bunkers and plenty of water			0
the country - club vibe should make them feel right at home			0
5 @entity3 flops while it turns out @entity43 has left some in - form players behind , such as @entity78 and @entity79 , not all of the @entity3 side arrive on the back of great recent results			0
it has been a relatively flat year for @entity84 and @entity85 while it can not be certain how rookies @entity86 and @entity88 will react			0
@entity85 has not enjoyed the most impressive season in the run - up to the @entity1 @entity91			0

five reasons @entity12 's @entity1 team should n't be written off
@entity14 absence could help them
@entity43 says @entity12 's are out to avenge @entity38
