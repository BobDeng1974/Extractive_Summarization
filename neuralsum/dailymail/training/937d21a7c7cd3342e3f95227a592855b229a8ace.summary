@entity0 will today tell voters he needs a decade in @entity2 as he puts the @entity3 , home ownership and higher taxes on the rich at the heart of @entity8 ’s bid for power			1
the @entity8 leader will use his annual party conference address to set out his ‘ ten - year plan ’ for what he will call a ‘ national mission ’			1
he will claim that a new mansion tax on expensive homes would raise almost £ 2billion a year , which could then be ploughed into the health service along with £ 1billion from other tax rises			1
and he will make an audacious attempt to steal @entity34 ’s vision of @entity35 as a property - owning democracy , setting a target to double the number of first - time buyers to 400,000 a year by 2025			1
the party says it will increase the number of homes being built to at least 200,000 a year by the end of the next parliament – although aides conceded that some would have to be built on greenfield sites			2
‘ that most @entity35 of dreams , the dream of home ownership , has faded , ’ the @entity8 leader will say , adding : ‘ @entity48 will be a top priority in our capital investment programme – because we need to start @entity35 building again			2
’ however , the most eye - catching announcement is expected to be billions of pounds more for the @entity58			2
@entity8 ’s proposed @entity59 would be imposed on properties worth more than £ 2million			2
the money raised used to be earmarked for the cost of reintroducing the 10p tax rate to help low earners			1
but yesterday shadow chancellor @entity65 announced the 10p rate could be paid for by abolishing the married tax allowance , freeing up revenue from the @entity59 for other spending			2
@entity8 would introduce ‘ bands ’ , similar to those used for council tax , with a higher charge on houses worth more than £ 10million			2
mr @entity65 has insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge			1
mr @entity0 , who was at the conference today alongside shadow chancellor @entity65 and deputy leader @entity80 , will claim that a mansion tax would raise almost £ 2billion a year there is expected to be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings , but who live in an expensive home			1
this is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years			0
a ‘ relief scheme ’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold			0
the mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties , so the wealthiest pay most			1
mr @entity0 ’s aspiration to increase home ownership is one of six ‘ goals ’ he would aim to achieve if he could have ten years in power			1
his plan to turn around @entity35 would also see @entity8 attempt to boost the number of apprenticeships to match the number of people going to university			1
large businesses hiring foreign workers from outside the @entity113 would be forced to take on young people as apprentices , as would every firm winning @entity118 contracts			0
mr @entity0 wants wages to grow at the same rate as the economy , he aims to halve the number of low - paid workers by 2025 and create a million ‘ green ’ jobs in environmentally - friendly industries over a decade			1
something to smile about ? mr @entity0 will set out to plans to build thousands of more homes and set a target of 400,000 new first - time buyers every year by 2025 large businesses hiring foreign workers from outside the @entity113 would be forced to take on young people as apprentices under the @entity135 's ' ten - year plan ' 1			1
giving all young people a shot in life ensure as many school - leavers go on to apprenticeships as go to university			2
tackling the @entity142 help working families share fairly in the wealth of our country so , when the economy grows , the wages of everyday working people grow at the same rate			2
restoring the dream of @entity153 meet demand for new homes for the first time in half a century – doubling the number of first - time buyers getting on to the housing ladder a year			1
tackling low wages halve the number of people on low pay in our country , changing the lives of over two million people			2
securing the future create one million more high - tech jobs by securing the @entity35 ’s position as a world leader in green industries			2
saving our @entity3 build a world - class , 21st century health and care service			0
with polls suggesting the @entity177 have extended their lead over @entity8 on the economy to 25 points , the widest margin since the days of @entity182 , mr @entity0 will appeal to the country to ‘ raise its sights ’ beyond the need for further austerity , saying : ‘ can anyone build a better future for the working people of @entity35 ? that is the @entity30 question			1
’ he will tell activists at the @entity23 conference that people in @entity194 voted for independence because they felt there was ‘ nothing left to lose ’ , adding : ‘ our task is to restore people ’s faith in the future			0
but the way to do it is not to break up our country			0
it is to break with the old way of doing things			0
’ he will go on to say : ‘ i ’m not talking about changing a policy , or a different programme			0
but something bigger : transforming the idea , the ethic , of how our country is run			0
‘ what people are saying is this country does n’t care about me			0
the economy does n’t work			0
and they are not wrong			0
but this @entity8 has a plan to put it right			0
‘ for @entity8 , this election is about you			0
you have made the sacrifices , you have taken home lower wages year after year , you have paid higher taxes , you have seen your energy bills rise , you have seen your @entity3 decline , you know this country does n’t work for you			0
we can build that better future for you and your family , wherever you live in the @entity35 , and this speech is about @entity8 ’s plan to do it : @entity8 ’s plan for @entity35 ’s future			1
’ however conservative sources said mr @entity0 ’s ‘ six - point plan ’ was @entity8 ’s seventh such effort in the last three years			1
and @entity239 , head of think - tank the @entity238 , said : ‘ introducing a mansion tax would be poorly targeted , arbitrary and deeply unfair			1
a person ’s assets do not always equate to their income			0
‘ evidence has also proven that their favoured 50p top rate of income tax raises trivial amounts of money			1
pouring extra money into the @entity3 , at the expense of those who already contribute a great deal is not the solution to the failings of our health system			0
’ @entity8 would abolish the government ’s flagship migration target if it wins power next year , shadow home secretary @entity259 said last night			0
miss @entity259 said the target would be replaced by ‘ different controls ’ to distinguish between asylum seekers , low - skilled workers and students .			0
