the annals of war are full of stories of lovelorn soldiers on the front line , dreaming wistfully of a girl back home			2
@entity8 was one such dream girl ... but rather than consuming the thoughts of a single soldier , she was desired by three			1
now , a collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22 - year - old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the @entity16 are to go under the hammer			1
they reveal three men in love , each fighting on two fronts : on one for their country , and on another for her heart			1
@entity26 met : @entity8 ( right ) ultimately chose @entity27 ( left ) , an air - crew chief stationed in @entity30 - even though they had never met under the hammer : a collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22 - year - old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the @entity16 are to go under the hammer love battle : they reveal three men in love , each fighting on two fronts - on one for their country , and on the other for her heart two of the men she knew , having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of @entity50 , @entity51			1
the third she had never met			0
what followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others ' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink			1
' i know that you think that i am crazy for asking you so many times , ' one writes from @entity65 , an @entity66 training center in @entity67			1
' did you think the ring idea is ok with you , or is it ? i love you			2
' another , also based in @entity67 , remembers his high school days with @entity8 , gushing : ' we used to really have a swell time until @entity74 nabbed me			2
' but it was the third she ultimately chose , thanks to his 11 intimate letters that reveal a man in love - despite never having laid eyes on the object of his affections			1
his name was @entity27 , an air - crew chief stationed in @entity30			1
competition : two of the men she knew , having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of @entity50 , @entity51			1
the third she had never met ( this is one of @entity27 's letters from @entity30 ) paper battlefield : what followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others ' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink his first dispatch begins with ' hello , @entity110			1
' but as their communications become more intimate , that turns to ' @entity114 ' and he signs off with ' always '			0
enigmatically , the collection contains none of @entity8 's responses to any of the men , so the reader is left to imagine what she must have felt			1
but what is clear is each man 's intentions : they all yearned for the war to end so they could return to marry their sweetheart			2
seventy years on , the letters , revealed by @entity130 newspaper , are being sold by @entity131 , a collector of historical memorabilia from @entity133 , @entity134			1
she bought them from a @entity133 dealer for $ 35			0
how they ended up in @entity133 - so far from @entity8 's home - is a mystery			1

' she said in the listing : ' i really wanted to see a photo of her after reading these letters , too , because she was quite the beauty according to the three soldiers who wrote to her			2
' she remembers being struck by ' how deeply in love ' @entity8 and @entity27 were , despite having never met			1
she was introduced to @entity27 through his sister , a college friend of @entity8 at @entity164 where she was studying to be a teacher in 1943			1
married : @entity27 , 25 , and @entity8 , 23 , married on april 21 , 1946 , in a candlelight wedding at @entity167			1
she wore a white - lace gown with an amethyst - and - pearl necklace that belonged to her grandmother but she did n't actually write to him until 1944 , after she had postponed her education to join the war effort , making anti-aircraft shells for the @entity175 in a munitions factory in @entity177			1
he wrote back on may 15 , just three weeks before the @entity179 troops would storm @entity181 in the d - day invasion			2
rather than discuss the dangers he faces in @entity30 , @entity27 instead writes about his love for the @entity51 mountains			1
' a fellow never realizes how beautiful his own home country is until he gets halfway around the world from it			0
' i was just thinking of the noises you can hear in those mountains early in the mornings and comparing them with here			0
over here just walking to work ( in knee - deep mud , of course ) you hear wild chickens , parrots screeching , monkeys screaming and carrying on , and then comes the roar of airplane engines --- such a combination			2
... ' i 'll be looking forward to the day when i can meet you in person , but for now a letter will do			2
be good , have fun this summer and write soon			0
' in his letters - some as long as seven pages - he writes about the monotony of breakfast - how they ate ' french toast , powdered eggs , french toast , powdered eggs '			1
he tells how he spent evenings watching movies , including @entity218 or wondering when he 'd next hear back from her			0
then , on december 2 , 1944 , seven months since their first correspondence , @entity27 sends two photographs of himself , and asks @entity8 the burning question			1
' home or church wedding ? ' he writes			0
' those big weddings are pretty and all , but a simple little home marriage seems more earnest and sincere			0
... ' what i 'm trying to say is that i only want to get married once and that 's for keeps			0
' he continues : ' i 'll never be content until i 've met you and tried to make some daydreams come true			0
' you know , i 've quit trying to reason out why i should fall for someone i 've never met - it just happened			0
' he often quotes song lyrics to describe how he feels when he opens her mail : ' i feel like a feather in the breeze ' and ' it rains pennies from heaven			0
' he also impresses her with his sense of humour and penchant for word play			0
in one letter he describes his comrades ' reactions to a movie , @entity255			0
lifetime of happiness : they lived out their days enjoying the quiet life			0
@entity27 worked in the post office for more than 20 years , then for more than 25 years at the family 's building supplies business emotional : reading their father 's letters was an emotional experience for the couple 's two children , @entity268 , 67 , and @entity269 , 63 , who had no idea they existed			1
they said reading his words as a young man in love with their mother , brought him back to life for a moment ' you know the kind ( of movie it is ) - lots of girls in sarongs , but not so much sarong on the girls			2
the way the guys were ohing and ahing there was n't anything sarong ( so wrong ) with the picture			0
' @entity27 was awarded the soldier 's medal for bravery and heroism beyond the call of duty when he and three others rescued a crew member after an oxygen tank exploded , catching a plane on fire			1
by march 1945 , it appears he received from her the news he had longed for			0
' you asked if i minded you saying that you love me , ' he writes			2
' @entity308 , i 'm just happy that you can say that			0
' @entity27 , 25 , and @entity8 , 23 , married on april 21 , 1946 , in a candlelight wedding at @entity167			1

@entity8 suffered a stroke in february 2004			2
she died a year later			0
their children , @entity268 , 67 , and @entity269 , 63 , told @entity333 of their surprise that the letters that brought their parents together during @entity154 still exist and had emerged on @entity152			1
and they have no idea how they ended up in @entity133			0
nevertheless , reading their father 's words as a young man in love with their mother , brought him back to life for a moment			0
' i can hear him , ' @entity316 said			0
' but a lot of it is the way i never heard him			0
