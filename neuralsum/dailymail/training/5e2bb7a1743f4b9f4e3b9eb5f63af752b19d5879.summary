@entity1 ’s vow that @entity2 and its allies would not allow @entity4 to form caliphate on @entity7 ’s doorstep had a hollow ring for the besieged people of @entity10 yesterday			1
huge plumes of smoke billowed over the pivotal border town as jihadi fanatics – some claiming to be @entity2 – launched a terrifying onslaught			1
@entity10 , which lies just inside @entity17 on the border with @entity21 member @entity19 , has been described as the town the world can not afford to lose to the terrorists			1
@entity10 is barely more than 200 yards from @entity19 , which wants to join the @entity38 , and for the past two weeks it has been possible to stand on a @entity19 hillside and watch as the jihadis under their black flag tighten their stranglehold on the @entity17 town			1
a massacre beckons , and nobody seems capable of stopping it			0
@entity10 , populated by @entity48 , fires rage as artillery shells thump into densely - packed neighbourhoods			1
at least 25 mortar rounds rained down yesterday on a hopelessly outnumbered army of resistance , a @entity56 style force that has come to be symbolised by a band of gun - toting grandmothers			2
a picture of the women , brandishing @entity30 assault rifles , was retweeted around the world yesterday by those anxious to raise awareness of the plight of the people of @entity10			1
outgunned , they respond only with occasional rocket - propelled grenades and bursts of rifle fire			1
they have also converted tractors and other farm equipment into armoured vehicles fitted with aging @entity76 - era guns			2
closing in fast : smoke rises as the @entity4 militants attack @entity10 , under the noses of forces in @entity19 at least 25 mortar rounds rained down yesterday on a hopelessly outnumbered army of resistance			1
above , strikes hit the residential area in @entity10 stopping towns like this falling was the reason the @entity88 launched a campaign of airstrikes – backed by the @entity91 in @entity92			1
but they have failed to stem @entity32 ’s brutal advance and a bloodbath seems horribly likely			1
seven men and three women from @entity10 have already been beheaded by the jihadis , with the women ’s heads placed on macabre display in @entity102 , a nearby is stronghold			2
a gruesome photograph uploaded to @entity104 purported to show a grinning is fighter clutching the decapitated head of a girl			0
and there are sickening reports of women and girls being raped			0
over the weekend , a @entity2 jihadi taunted the people of @entity10 by posting another photo showing his terror gang was within sight of their homes			1
the siege has forced some 160,000 people to flee across the frontier			1
some sit weeping on hilltops on the @entity19 side of the border , watching helplessly while their homes go up in smoke			0
fleeing families have told of unspeakable horrors			0
one young father , @entity130 , who fled ten days ago , revealed how the body of his sister in law and eight - year - old niece were found in pools of blood			2
‘ they had been raped and their hearts were cut out , ’ he said			0
‘ i buried them with my own hands			0
’ @entity4 is using captured @entity88 - made tanks and other military hardware which had been left in the hands of the @entity92 army , whole regiments of which have simply fled from @entity32			1
the @entity91 can not intervene because it has no mandate to bomb in @entity17 , despite @entity149 flying right overhead to conduct bombing raids in neighbouring @entity92			2
@entity88 warplanes have been bombing around @entity10 , and yesterday at least 16 is militants were declared dead from airstrikes and ground attacks			1
but it is not enough			0
@entity158 refugees wait by the side of the road near @entity161 , @entity19 , after their arrival from @entity10			2
the siege has forced some 160,000 people to flee across the frontier the @entity19 have promised to ‘ do whatever we can ’ – a stray mortar even landed a mile inside @entity19 yesterday , wounding five people in a house near the town of @entity161			1
convoys of lorries carrying @entity19 tanks have been driven south to the border			0
however there was no sign of them arriving yesterday			0
on social media , tech - savvy @entity32 has been crowing that no one can stop it fulfilling its dream of carving out a medieval caliphate , in which anyone not adhering to its arbitrary strictures is beheaded or crucified , or has limbs chopped off			1
yesterday it was reported that some @entity2 jihadists have found it too much			0
up to 100 have defected and are stranded in @entity19 because they fear imprisonment if they return to the @entity2			0
yet an estimated dozen or so would - be holy warriors from @entity2 are still joining the warped cause every month			2
mr @entity1 warned last month of the ‘ poisonous ’ threat of jihadis returning to the @entity2 , and said the world had to deal with @entity32			1
a woman waits by the side of the road near the @entity19 border after fleeing from @entity10			2
one man carries lightweight mattresses from his besieged home he said : ‘ if it succeeds , we would be facing a terrorist state on the shores of the @entity212 and bordering a @entity21 member			0
’ but the ease with which @entity2 and other fanatics slip between @entity19 and @entity17 , under the noses of border guards , makes a mockery of claims @entity19 is cracking down on its label as a ‘ gateway to jihad ’			1
@entity223 , a hotel owner in the frontier town of @entity225 , said : ‘ we never see the recruits – they cross at night and are smuggled illegally under a fence – but we see their bags , which the smugglers transport separately			2
every two or three days , about 50 or 60 @entity231 rucksacks come through the official border crossing , and we can see their luggage tags – @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236			0
‘ the smugglers arrange for their rucksacks to follow them			0
a @entity19 porter can carry them through the @entity19 border gate and leave them in “ no - mans - land ” and then a @entity17 porter can come from the other side and pick them up			1
it means the jihadists are reunited with all their belongings			0
’ there are dozens of border towns strung along the 560 - mile frontier where potential recruits can simply melt away until it is time to cross into @entity17			1
stopping towns like @entity10 , pictured under siege yesterday , falling was the reason the @entity88 launched a campaign of airstrikes – backed by the @entity91 in @entity92 @entity257 , 21 , a @entity17 who had just crossed illegally from @entity17 into @entity19 , said : ‘ if anything , it was easier than previous times			1
‘ it is very well arranged now , in both directions			0
i got into a van with no windows with about 20 people , men and women			2
‘ we drove to a place on the border and then waited for a few hours			0
the smugglers are constantly on their phones , checking with their people on both sides			0
‘ then they give the signal that it is clear , and the doors open and we all run			0
this time , there was a fence and a one - metre tunnel dug under it , which we all crawled through			0
‘ no one asks any questions			0
’ in the next few days , if @entity10 falls , @entity286 and the @entity287 will face plenty of questions about whether their strategy to deal with @entity4 is working			2
for the people of @entity10 , it will be too late .			1
