by @entity0 published : 14:04 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 15:04 est , 18 november 2013 robust : the @entity1 has unveiled strict rules that would take pay - as - you - go phones from gang members gang members will be banned from wearing hoodies , owning pay - as - you - go phones , and riding bicycles in a new set of measures to break up their activities			1
they will also be banished from the postcode their gang operates in			1
the set of court orders was announced today by the new head of the @entity1 , @entity20			1
she told the @entity22 : ‘ it ’s being able to identify people and limit the type of activity that they get involved in that would support ongiong gang activity			1
‘ curtailing people ’s ability to associate post-conviction is also a really good way to prevent further gang activity			1
' she added : ‘ we need to make sure that the @entity1 is taking a really robust line when it comes to prosecuting gang crime			1
' this has such an impact on communities that we ’ve really got to take a very tough line			0
' however , @entity41 , the founder and senior mentor of @entity43 , blasted the measures as ' ridiculous ' that ' will just make everything harder '			1
he told @entity46 : ' i think some of those measures are ridiculous			1
banning hoodies in the winter is just unfair			0
do we stop everyone from wearing hoodies ? just stop making them			0
and bicycles - how is that going to help ? ' i can understand that if they 've got a phone in their name , they are then accountable for it			1
but the bicycle is going too far , and hoodies is going too far			0
' they have done the robust approach			2
it is all robust , robust , robust			2
it means there are more obstacles than support so i think a little bit more effort should be put into support			0
' hoodie ban : gang members ( posed by models ) would be banned from wearing hoodies in the new measures disagree : @entity41 ( right ) , founder and senior mentor of @entity43 , blasted the measures outlined today by @entity20 ( left ) as ' too robust '			1
he said the ' @entity81 - style ' system provides too many obstacles to youths he attacked the notion of specific ' gang prosecutors ' as ' @entity81 ' : ' we are going too far in our @entity81 - style approach			1
we need to look at it from an @entity90 perspective and come up with an approach that works			0
tragic : @entity92 , 16 , was murdered by @entity92 , 19 , in may 2008 whilst at the @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95 ' the more rules and boundaries there are will just make them rebel more			0
' we need to look at the reasons behind what they are doing and work with them			0
' @entity103 , founder of @entity105 project , one of @entity95 's leading gang intervention services , also warned against strict measures			1
he told @entity46 : ' enforcement measures such as those outlined here have their place when applied appropriately and take into account the situation of the individual concerned			2
' however , in our experience in providing one of @entity95 's largest gang intervention projects , they absolutely must be accompanied with a package of support which addresses the reasons why young people are involved in gangs and which helps them leave gangs safely and permanently			2
' prince @entity124 has also announced his own volunteer - based initiative to deal with the soaring rates of violence among young people on @entity130 's streets			2
it is a far cry from the strict , ' robust ' lines ms @entity133 is proposing to draw to curb violence			2
moved by the murder of 16 - year - old @entity92 in 2008 , the heir to the throne is leading an event called @entity139 in @entity140 next week			0
flanked by 50 young people , @entity142 and @entity143 , he will make a plea for more to be invested in groups such as @entity146 to give gang members ' a rite of passage '			1
he said : ' the @entity149 are convinced – as i have been for the past 40 years – that part of the solution is in providing more structured activities for young people			0
' in my opinion , tragedies such as the murder of @entity156 and @entity158 ’s son are the extreme result of too many young people no longer guided through a rite of passage ; young people who would benefit from the guidance and help of organisations such as the @entity146 , @entity166 , cadets and other youth organisations			0
' however , these are all groups which are hampered in their growth by a lack of adult volunteers			0
' that vision is that all of us , from all walks of life , will ‘ step up ’ and pledge , at # iwill , to help young people take every opportunity to be of service to others			0
initiative : prince @entity124 , here with @entity156 and @entity182 , is promoting volunteer - based gang initiatives ' i know that young people have an immense contribution to make to our society , but i have long believed we are failing to do enough to unlock their talent and unleash their energies to help tackle all sorts of challenges			2
' young people are the solution to so much and yet , too frequently , they are seen as the problem			0

@entity20 , new head of @entity1 , announced new ' robust ' court orders
would ban gang members from riding bicycles or being in certain areas
community workers blast the measures as ' ridiculous ' and ' @entity81 '
