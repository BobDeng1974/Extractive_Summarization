by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 13 december 2012 updated : 05:43 est , 14 december 2012 they do say dogs will eat anything , but a professional footballer was left stunned after vets found ten @entity6 in his hungry hound 's stomach			1
on - loan @entity10 midfielder @entity9 was left with a hefty Â£ 800 vet bill after his pet pooch @entity14 swallowed the wiry wash clothes			1
the 26 - year - old had returned to his home in @entity18 , @entity19 , following his team 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity22 in the @entity23 earlier this month , but was surprised when his five - year - old boxer did not greet him with her usual enthusiasm			2
x-ray : @entity14 needed a two hour operation to remove the @entity6 she swallowed when the cupboard door in the kitchen was left open while it was being cleaned eats anything : the hungry hound has been known to eat some unusual objects in the past , including one of @entity9 's compression recovery skins he said : ' she usually goes mad the second i open the door as i do n't get home all that much these days			1
' but that day i remember she just wagged her tail a little then wandered back to lie down - i knew something was wrong straight away			0
' i had to get back down to @entity45 to train but my partner was great and rushed her straight to the vets			0
' next thing i knew she told me that @entity14 had eaten ten @entity6 - not just the normal ones but the wiry ones too			1
' vets at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , had first thought x-rays showed a large collection of tin foil before stunned nurses opened @entity14 up and began removing a whole packet of @entity61 pads			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the vets thought it was tin foil at first which left us both a bit confused			1
' but when they got them out we eventually worked out that my partner must have left the cupboard door open when she was cleaning the kitchen			0
' it could only have been for a few minutes but @entity14 will eat anything			2
@entity73 : the fine steel wool cleaning pads do n't exactly look particularly appetising ' we had a similar situation when i was at @entity76 and she ate one of my recovery skins after i put it on the radiator to dry			0
' it was an expensive day but luckily we have pet insurance and everyone at the vets was great			0
' @entity14 is fantastic dog and has never given us any trouble but you just ca n't leave anything about in our house , even for a second , or she 'll eat it			1
' mr @entity9 lives with his long - term partner of six years , @entity94 , 23 , who is currently on maternity leave from her job at @entity97			2
on the pitch : @entity9 , left , in action during @entity10 's 0 - 0 draw at @entity101 earlier this month the @entity103 star has n't let his poorly pooch affect his form though after playing a key role in @entity10 's recent 11 - game unbeaten run in both league and cup whilst on loan in @entity112 from his parent club , @entity113			1
@entity14 is now recovering at home after her two hour - long surgery			1
@entity117 , head nurse at @entity52 , said : ' @entity14 came to the surgery with a little vomiting but we were not overly worried by her condition at first			2
' she has had foreign bodies in her before so we took a quick x-ray and we were amazed with what we saw			0
' you could clearly make out something large and metallic in her stomach on the x-ray			0
' the objects were so big we knew they could not have been passed naturally - even by a large dog			0
' it was a very serious situation and we knew that if we left them in her stomach she would have died			0
' we took her straight into surgery and pulled out a whole pack of @entity6 - they just kept coming			2
' afterwards we stitched her up and we are delighted to hear she has made a full recovery			0
