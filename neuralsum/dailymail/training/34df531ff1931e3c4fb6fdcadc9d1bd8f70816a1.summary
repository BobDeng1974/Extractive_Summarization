the @entity7 currently holds records of around 1,000 people who have not been identified , some dating back to the 1950s			1
the bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals			1
tragic : pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones			1
this picture shows the tattoos on the arm of a man found collapsed in a north @entity21 street in 2007 unidentified : the man on the left died after he was hit by a train in @entity25 in 1995			0
this man , right , was found lying in a makeshift tent adjacent to the @entity28 in @entity29 in 1997			0
both have never been identified it will feature pictures of bodies , but any images deemed to be distressing will be marked with a warning and require confirmation before viewing			2
they include a photograph of the arm of one body found collapsed in @entity41 , north @entity21 in 2007 , easily recognisable by the distinctive tattoos of panther and @entity44 on his right forearm			0
many of the bodies have washed up on beaches , unrecognisable as a result of being exposed to the elements , or have been discovered on railway lines			0
some 250 people die on the @entity56 's railways every year , most as a result of suicide , according to @entity56 transport police , and a significant number of these bodies are never identified			1
trying to find matches for the corpses against the list of the missing is also very time - consuming			2
unidentified : this computer - generated image is of a man found floating in the @entity67 , near @entity68 , while the man on the left was found washed up on a riverbank on the @entity71 search : the bureau has launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals			1
this shoe belonged to a man who was found in 2003 in the sea , near @entity80 , @entity81 help needed : this clothing belonged to an oriental man found in the @entity85 near @entity86 in 1989 by law , local councils must cremate or bury unidentified corpses , to avoid the risk of disease			0
this makes identification far more difficult : cremation destroys dna , while to exhume a buried body , police must seek the approval of a coroner before any further investigation can be carried out			0
the graves are often marked with wooden plaques stating ' unknown male ' or ' unknown female '			0
the @entity7 published a report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in @entity56 based on figures provided by forces across the country on the number of missing person incidents reported in 2010/11			1
the bureau are a total of around 1,000 unidentified cases which remain unidentified			2
just six per cent of those involve living people , most of whom have been found without identification and suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia			2
the vast majority of cases - 83 per cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there are still more than 100 unidentified body parts ( 11 per cent ) sitting in police morgues across @entity56 waiting to be identified			2
with a small number of body parts ( 11 per cent ) and unidentified alive people ( 6 per cent ) also still awaiting identification			0
@entity135 , from the @entity7 , said : ' the aim of the new site is to bring closure to the families and friends of the people featured			1
' with new unidentified person cases we rely on modern forensic techniques for identification but on older cases we look to use every tool available and believe that case publicity is the best chance of getting images recognised			0
' this will be the first time families of missing people have been able to search through records for themselves and it will empower families to play an active part in the search for their loved ones			2
' members of the public will be able to search the cases and provide information online			0
any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case			0
details of all unidentified cases , including bodies , remains and living people , will be posted on the website - apart from cases where remains are too partial to be of value			1
the site : the bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals the bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received			1
the @entity56 @entity7 continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals , to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends			1
the @entity7 is also running a special project , called @entity202 , providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people , bodies and body part cases			1
similar websites have been set up in certain states in the @entity209 , and by police in @entity211 and @entity212			0
the @entity7 is part of the @entity214			2
