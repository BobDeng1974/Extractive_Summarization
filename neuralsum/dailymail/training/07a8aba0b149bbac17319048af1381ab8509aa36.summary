by @entity0 a terrier destined for a life indoors after vets discovered he suffers from hay fever has been relieved of his symptoms thanks to a @entity8 onesie			1
one - year - old @entity9 would be covered in painful , red and itchy sores after going for walks with owner @entity13 , 50 , from @entity14 , @entity15			1
the dog was given various treatments including @entity18 before mrs @entity13 discovered the revolutionary silver bodysuit while searching for a cure online			1
one - year - old @entity9 was diagnosed with a pollen allergy after he came up with red itchy sores after walks @entity9 with his owner @entity13 , 50 , who came across the @entity8 suit whilst researching treatments online mrs @entity13 said : ' he was booked in to be castrated around april , may time and i noticed he had a really really itchy red tummy			1
' i thought it might be fleas at first but after talking to the vet we realised it might be a pollen allergy			1
she added : ' we tried numerous things including @entity18 but nothing seemed to work and he was just miserable			2
' ' it got to the point where he was just trapped in the house unable to go out			2
to have a dog that ca n’t even go out for a walk is just awful , i felt terrible			2
' it was then that she came across @entity46 - based company @entity45 and decided to give the one - of - a - kind lightweight , breathable onesie a shot			1
' everything changed from there			0
he ’s so much better now and the sores have really settled down , ' she added			2
owner @entity13 has bought @entity9 another suit so he can alternate his look ' he wears his bodysuit all day long and he loves it			1
he puts his little head in and lifts his paws up to help me put it on , it really does n’t bother him at all			0
' now he can go and play outside and enjoy running around without a care			1
' the all - in - one , which can set pet owners back anything from £ 34 ( $ 58.50 ) to £ 50 ( $ 86.50 ) , has proven so popular with the @entity66 that mrs @entity13 has chosen to buy a second outfit			1
' it ’s been so great i ’ve bought him another so i can alternate			0
he ’ll have his own little wardrobe full of them soon			0
' the idea for the onesie was thought up by @entity75 , co-founder of @entity45			2
she said : ' i came up with the idea as a way of controlling shedding			0
' our first child was just beginning to crawl and with three large dogs it was impossible to keep our floors free of dog hair			0
' many people purchase one of our lycra bodysuits and have such great success they purchase more			0
' we have a lot of word of mouth referrals but then again the coat speaks for itself , there ’s nothing like having a dog wearing a lycra bodysuit in the park or walking down the street to draw people ’s attention			0
' the joy i experience when i hear that one of our bodysuits has dramatically improved the quality of a dog ’s life is beyond words			0
it ’s times like that when i know i have the best job in the world			0
