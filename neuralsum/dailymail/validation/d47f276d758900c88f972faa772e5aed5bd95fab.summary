these days the @entity0 is a marathon not a sprint but @entity3 appears to have an outstanding chance of establishing a big lead in the trainers ’ title with four stellar chances on tuesday			1
@entity12 ’ @entity11 favourite @entity9 ( @entity0 , 1.30 ) is the first of the @entity3 battalion to leave the blocks before the baton is passed to powerhouses @entity17 @entity18 ( @entity0 , 2.05 ) in the @entity19 and the exciting @entity20 ( @entity0 , 3.20 ) , who boasts an outstanding chance in the @entity11			1
many feel @entity23 will complete the victory parade with her coronation in the @entity27 , but she will be priced prohibitively to do so and her task may not be as straightforward as it seems after a year ’s absence			2
@entity30 is the first of @entity3 battalion to race at @entity0 on tuesday of the quartet , @entity32 arguably faces the most competition with last year ’s winner @entity35 and @entity36 , an unlucky third following an interrupted passage , in opposition along with @entity41 legend @entity39			1
however , @entity32 ’s potential is as yet untapped , whereas the level his rivals have reached is known — albeit a lofty standard			2
the selection destroyed the opposition in the @entity48 at @entity49 with the form receiving a boost when third - home @entity52 , beaten 17 lengths by @entity32 , hammered @entity55 at @entity56 in grade two company			0
that performance poured scorn on the theory @entity32 has beaten nothing in his unbeaten eight - race hurdling career , although it is worth noting he also boasts a 22 - length mauling of @entity68 in a @entity70 bumper and a 12 - length demolition of the talented @entity72 on his record			0
@entity74 , pictured on monday , faces tough competition from last year 's winner @entity35 and @entity36 in short , the son of @entity78 could prove to be a class apart , especially if @entity36 continues to drift right at his hurdles , a habit which threatens his hopes of becoming a champion			1
@entity35 is solid and comes to himself at this time of year on spring ground , but his limitations have been somewhat exposed by @entity39 in @entity86 this winter and he remains vulnerable to an emerging talent like @entity32			0
@entity39 has been done few favours by the drying ground , but the third of @entity3 ’ representatives , @entity92 , could sneak into the places			0
tuesday ’s nap vote goes the way of @entity96 ( @entity0 , nap , 4.40 ) , who appears to have undergone an interesting preparation for the @entity100 and was a fine second in a handicap at the meeting 12 months ago when an error at the last fence denied him victory .			0

@entity3 looks to have chance of establishing lead in trainers ' title
@entity30 is the first of @entity3 ' horses to ride at @entity0 at 1.30
