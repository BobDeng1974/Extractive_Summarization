children as young as three are being asked to sign a contract pledging not to use transphobic language at school			1
the pledge is contained in a ‘ home - school agreement ’ which all children must sign before they start at @entity8 in september			1
the infants must also promise to refrain from using homophobic and racist phrases and to be tolerant of people with different sexual orientations and lifestyles			0
each child must print their name and provide a signature to confirm that they understand their ‘ responsibilities ’ while attending the school			0
anti-bullying : @entity8 - led by executive headteacher @entity21 - sent out an agreement for all new children to sign before they start in the new academic year tick - box bureaucracy : but parents were dumbfounded when it included a demand not to use ' transphobic language ' , as it would mean explaining something many three - year - olds are not even aware exists it is understood that teachers at the @entity34 school introduced the document to help stamp out playground prejudice against transgender people and a wide range of disabilities and cultures			1
but yesterday the chairman of governors said that they knew nothing about the change to the contract , which was also dismissed as ‘ bonkers ’ by parents who said pre-school children could not be expected to understand such complex issues			2
the contract was sent to parents last week along with the letters offering a place at the school			2
it reads : ‘ we believe that every child can and should reach their full potential			0
this is achieved when all staff , parents and children understand their responsibilities and work together towards the same goals , as detailed in our home - school agreement			1
’ in a list of responsibilities for pupils to sign is a clause which states pupils will be tolerant of ‘ sexual orientation or lifestyle and refrain from using racist or homophobic or transphobic language in school ’			1
the contract does not say what will happen to pupils who disobey the clauses			0
yesterday , one mother said : ‘ my son is three yet he is meant to pledge not to use “ transphobic ” language			0
‘ how am i meant to explain it to my three - year - old that he must sign on the dotted line not to do something which he is not even aware exists when he can barely hold a crayon ? this just fills me with dread about what sort of politically correct , tick - box bureaucracy runs this school			1
‘ i agree that teachers need to be made aware of transgender issues as it affects a number of children who suffer in silence , but to make three - year - olds sign up to something they do not even know exists is bonkers			1
’ sorry : the school 's chair of governors has apologised for any offence or distress caused to parents or pupils @entity8 is a foundation school , which means it is funded by the government through @entity112 - run @entity110 , which yesterday refused to comment on the matter			1
the school , led by executive head teacher @entity21 , also declined to comment			0
yesterday , @entity115 , chairman of governors , said he was not aware of ‘ the change in format ’ to the home - school agreement			2
he said @entity120 was an ‘ interim executive head ’ at @entity8 , adding : ‘ given she is a @entity110 employee who was personally referred to @entity122 by the executive director for children and young people , @entity123 , i am surprised the local authority have elected not to comment on the matter once			2
‘ on behalf of the governing body i would like to sincerely apologise for any offence or distress caused to our parents and pupils			1
until i have held a full inquiry into the matter , i am not in a position to make any further comment			0
’ the controversy comes in the wake of the @entity142 ’s @entity141 drive , which requires all schools to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles			0
it was introduced last year in response to the @entity150 scandal , which saw schools in @entity152 allegedly infiltrated by @entity154 hardliners hoping to impose an @entity154 agenda			0
but since then , schools have complained they have been penalised by @entity156 for failing to meet the criteria			0
two christian schools in the @entity159 said pupils were asked ‘ inappropriate ’ questions on race and sexuality – and branded intolerant when they gave the wrong answers			0
one ten - year - old girl was left in tears after inspectors allegedly asked her ‘ whether she felt trapped in someone else ’s body ’			1
two years ago @entity8 came to national attention when @entity172 , then chairman of governors , claimed expenses for travel to the school for meetings from his home in @entity180 in @entity181 .			2

@entity8 demands pupils sign ' agreement ' before starting
includes line asking children to ' refrain from using *...* transphobic language '
*shocked* parents say asking three - year - olds to sign agreement is ' bonkers '
chairman of school 's governing body apologised for any offence caused
