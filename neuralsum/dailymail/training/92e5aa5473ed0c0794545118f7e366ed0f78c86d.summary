by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 23 august 2013 admission : director general of the @entity4 @entity3 said that staff knew about the doomed it project but were to afraid to blow the whistle the @entity4 ’s director general admitted yesterday that his staff knew for years that a £ 100million it project was failing but did nothing about it because of a culture at the corporation that prevents whistleblowers from coming forward			1
@entity3 acknowledged a series of recent failures at the corporation , including the costly @entity19 ( @entity19 ) fiasco and the severance payoff scandal			1
saying there was an ‘ appalling divide ’ between managers and staff , he admitted there was an ‘ officer class ’ at the top of the @entity4 and blamed a culture of ‘ finger - pointing ’ for preventing whistleblowers from raising the alarm when things went wrong			1
@entity3 cancelled the @entity19 in may , saying it would be ‘ throwing good money after bad ’ to complete it			1
launched in 2008 , it was meant to digitise all @entity4 production but rapidly ran over budget and beyond deadlines			1
speaking at the @entity39 he said : ‘ what worries me most about @entity19 is the fact we went round the place and people said , “ yeah , we knew about that ” but no one said			1
that ’s the problem of a culture where fingers are pointed , blame is appointed – people do n’t feel they can own up and say something is going wrong			2
‘ i do n’t like that sort of culture			2
i want a culture where people can say , “ we can take risks , we can do things which are creatively difficult , organisationally difficult , and we can learn from our mistakes			0
” ’ making an unexpected appearance in @entity61 , @entity3 was also forced answer questions about the payoff scandal , following last month ’s disclosure that the @entity4 handed departing staff £ 300million over eight years			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) was meant to allow @entity4 staff to access everything in the archive from their computers , doing away with the need for video or audio tapes one of his chief inquisitors was former @entity4 journalist @entity76 , who left the corporation after the @entity78 last year			1
she was one of two reporters to work on a @entity80 expose of the predatory dj that was scrapped by news executives in 2010			0
miss @entity76 criticised the director general ’s response to the crisis , saying : ‘ the whole issue of severance payments gets to the heart of something that has been badly wrong with the @entity4 for decades , which is the creation of an officer class that seems to fly in the face of the principles of public service broadcasting			2
@entity95 says he does n’t deserve his £ 1.5million @entity4 pay deal			1
the @entity99 striker - turned - tv pundit said : ‘ if you are at the top in entertainment you earn money that you can never justify to ordinary people doing proper jobs			0
i ’m not even going to try			0
do i deserve it ? probably not – but who would turn it down ? ’ although @entity95 has never publicly disclosed his @entity111 salary , he is believed to have earned £ 2million before taking a £ 500,000 pay cut earlier this year			0
but the 52 - year - old presenter – who also has lucrative contracts with @entity116 network @entity115 and @entity117 – insisted he would be able to rake in even more money if he worked for a different channel			0
‘ that is the downside of working for the @entity4 , ’ he said			2
‘ i could earn more elsewhere , but because it ’s the licence fee you are open to criticism			0
’ ‘ the corporation has been treated as a get - rich scheme where the people at the top reward the outgoing people at the top even if they have got new jobs to go to , even if they have been given more than a year ’s notice of their departure			0
’ @entity3 admitted the debacle had been ‘ terrible for morale ’ within the @entity4 and agreed there had been an ‘ officer class ’ at the top of the corporation			1
he said he wanted to ‘ heal this appalling divide ’			0
miss @entity76 criticised the @entity4 ’s leadership for failing to punish executives over the @entity143 scandal			2
‘ it does n’t seem anyone has taken responsibility for it , ’ she said			0
‘ how can people learn if mistakes are n’t admitted ? ’			0
