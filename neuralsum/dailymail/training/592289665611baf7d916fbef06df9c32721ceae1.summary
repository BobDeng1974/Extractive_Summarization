by @entity0 at the crack of dawn , gangs of black grouse put on one of the @entity7 's most bizarre spectacles			1
over the course of two hours , endangered male grouse puff themselves up , strut around , leap into the air , and square up to each other in an attempt to impress the watching females			1
the black grouse is one of only three @entity18 species to exhibit this strange ' lekking ' ritual behaviour			1
@entity20 has arrived in the @entity7 and the aggressive mating rituals of the black grouse have begun			1
the bird , native to @entity24 , is one of only three @entity18 species which exhibits ' lekking ' behaviour the practice involves males competing with each other on a patch of territory known as a lek - a circular area roughly 65ft ( 20m )			1
within this space , five to ten male birds battle it out to dominate the centre of the circle and show off their skills			2
once the hens arrive , the atmosphere becomes hostile - the males jumped at each other , ' crashing around like dodgems '			2
the dominant bird , which secures the centre of the lek , is marked out as the alpha male			1
calls and posturing are then used to attract a mate			0
in contrast to this lavish display , the females known as ‘ greyhens ’ , remain camouflaged in their habitat			0

they are also known as black cocks and grey hens , because of the colour of the male and female birds respectively			2
