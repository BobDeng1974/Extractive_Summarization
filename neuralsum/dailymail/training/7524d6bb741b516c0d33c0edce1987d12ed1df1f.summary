sen. @entity0 , the @entity1 's minority leader in @entity3 ' upper house , strode onto the stage thursday at the @entity5 with real firepower : a flint - lock , muzzle - loading rifle hoisted over his head			1
the weapon was a gift for @entity12 , a retiring conservative senator from @entity13			2
but the firearm , though silent , made as much noise as @entity16			0
easily the most weakly applauded keynote speaker in the @entity5 event 's first day , @entity16 channeled the late @entity22 's famous @entity21 moment , when he said the government could take his guns ' from my cold , dead hands ! ' – and then the moment was over			1
his speech , if another @entity1 had delivered it , might have gone over with as much spark as @entity31 or @entity32 brought to their moments in the spotlight			0
' i ’ve spent so much time over at the supreme court trying to stop these guys that i ’m practically on a first - name basis with the bailiff			0
' but @entity16 , known more for his compromising than his fighting , could n't win over a crowd of the nation 's most committed and strident right - wing activists			2
they came to suburban @entity77 this week to hear @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , not the senator who is running a dead heat with a liberal 's liberal , @entity83 secretary of state @entity84 – and still faces a primary challenge beforehand			2
' if i 'm given the opportunity to lead the @entity88 next year , i wo n’t let you down , ' @entity16 said thursday			2
danger ahead : @entity83 's @entity92 secretary of state , @entity84 , wants @entity16 's job and she 's polling neck - and - neck with him misfire : the establishment @entity16 brought the house to a dull murmur , compared with the @entity99 renegades who drove thousands to applaud even if the @entity88 returns to @entity1 control after november , @entity16 might not make it back to @entity77 to see it			1
he entered the @entity5 stage to the sound of @entity108 's ' @entity107			0
' so the six - term incumbent is pulling out all the stops in an attempt to court red - meat conservatives , even with gun - rights imagery that better fit @entity21 honcho @entity114 , who would speak on the same stage three hours later			0
he left his tricorn hat and hunting boots at home			0
the @entity21 , it turns out , provided the rifle as a ' @entity121 ' for sen. @entity12 , since the @entity13 was one of the nation 's most consistent @entity125 hawks			1
and @entity16 's biggest applause line came when he handed the gun to @entity12			1
' this is for you , for your distinguished service , ' he said			0
the annual @entity5 conference brings together thousands of prospective presidential candidates , conservative opinion leaders and tea party activists – and a horde of media .			1

the tepid @entity16 's only big applause line came when he presented sen. @entity12 with a rifle as a retirement gift from the @entity21
the annual @entity5 rallies thousands of right - wingers around presidential candidates and other *movement* *celebs*
@entity16 , the @entity88 's @entity1 minority leader , is seen as more compromise - oriented than the @entity99 - linked *headliners* at @entity5
he faces a stiff *re-election* challenge and may not survive , even if the @entity1 retakes control of the @entity88 in november
