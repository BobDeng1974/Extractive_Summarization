adoption chiefs have ended a ban on young children being placed with e-cigarette users after @entity4 highlighted the ‘ misguided ’ policy			0
last week , this newspaper told how a professional , middle - aged couple had been barred from adopting after a social worker spotted the would - be father ‘ smoking ’ an e-cigarette			0
but last monday , just 24 hours after we published our story , the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) updated to its guidance , saying it had changed its e-cigarette policy			1
at least a dozen councils in @entity18 had imposed a blanket - ban on placing children with parents who smoke , but new advice means some of these bans could be lifted e-cigarettes do not produce smoke and the passive risk to others from the vapour they emit is ‘ extremely low ’ , according to a report last year by @entity18			1
neither is there any evidence to back up claims – widely held by e-cigarette critics – that they encourage children to try real cigarettes			0
nonetheless , we revealed that at least a dozen councils across @entity18 had imposed blanket - bans on placing under - fives with e-cigarette users			1
the councils cited guidance from the @entity14 , which had recommended ‘ that users of e-cigarettes be considered as smokers ’ until concerns about the devices were cleared up			1
but now in the update to its guidance , the @entity14 stated : ‘ at the next meeting of our @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , we will be recommending that [ fostering and adoption ] agencies now consider e-cigarettes as different to tobacco cigarettes			1
‘ agencies should therefore recognise the low risk to children and not see the use of e-cigarettes as a reason to preclude foster carers or adopters purely on this basis			1
each circumstance should be risk assessed on an individual basis			0
’ it continued : ‘ e-cigarettes appear to have positive benefits for smokers when providing them with a route to abstinence and the risk to children from passive smoke is lessened			2
‘ however , this needs to be balanced against the risk of providing a model for the child of smoking now , or in the future			0
new guidelines say e-cigarettes should be considered as different from traditional tobacco cigarettes , as the danger of passive smoking is greatly reduced ‘ we will continue to monitor research into e-cigarettes and will continue reviewing our recommendations			1
’ the @entity14 said it had changed its guidance ‘ in light of the latest @entity18 report ’ – which @entity4 cited in last week ’s article			1
‘ @entity97 ’ and ‘ @entity98 ’ , who went through a year - long adoption selection process with @entity101 only to be turned down after @entity98 was spotted puffing on an e-cigarette , last night hailed the change as ‘ really good news ’			0
@entity97 said : ‘ it ’s a shame for us that it took such lengths for things to change , but at least other couples should be spared what we went through			0
’ @entity110 , professor of health psychology at @entity111 , who last week described the e-cigarette banning policy as ‘ misguided and unethical ’ , said : ‘ this is very welcome news , and demonstrates the importance of ensuring that policy decisions are based on good information			0
’ @entity117 , professor of tobacco addiction at the @entity118 in @entity119 , said : ‘ i welcome the changed recommendation , in particular that e-cigarettes be considered different to tobacco cigarettes			2
‘ e-cigarettes and cigarettes are indeed very different products in how they work , what they contain , what they emit and their relative harmfulness			2
‘ by making this change , @entity14 will help people to understand that e-cigarettes are a less harmful alternative to deadly tobacco cigarettes			2

dozen councils in @entity18 had bans on foster parents using e-cigarettes
but guidance has been updated to treat *gadgets* differently to tobacco
