by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 16 january 2013 updated : 11:29 est , 16 january 2013 heart - breaking : @entity2 was diagnosed when he was one the parents of a young boy with a deadly and extremely rare brain condition are trying to raise £ 5,000 so that he can have crucial treatment in @entity7			1
little @entity8 , who is four , suffers from @entity9 , which causes cavernomas , or oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life - threatening strokes or seizures			1
@entity2 has already had one stroke and is likely to have more , so his parents want to fly him to @entity7 to see the world authority on the disorder			2
dr @entity20 runs a highly - rated clinic in @entity22 that offers specialised mri scans to assess the permeability , or leakiness , of the blood vessels			1
he is an authority on the rare genetic mutation that is known to affect fewer than 100 people in the world			1
@entity2 lives in @entity30 , @entity31 , with his parents @entity33 , 38 , @entity34 , 39 , and sisters @entity36 , 15 , and @entity37 , eight			1
his family is now campaigning to raise the money needed to fly him to @entity22 for treatment for the condition that was diagnosed shortly after @entity2 's first birthday			1
mr @entity8 said : ' last night he was sobbing because of a pain in his leg due to his condition			1
' sometimes he says " my head hurts now , let 's go to the doctors "			0
' that 's totally heartbreaking for us all			0
' there is no known cure for the genetic condition that could kill @entity2 at any time			1
treatment at dr @entity20 's clinic offers @entity2 the best chance of living as long as possible			0
mrs @entity60 said : ' @entity2 needs to be watched constantly as the condition affects his balance , his body movement , and his behaviour			2
' i call it the @entity67 condition - one moment he can be fine and happy , the next @entity2 has turned into a monster			1
fund - raising : @entity69 need to raise £ 5,000 to take his son to see the world authority in @entity9 ' on saturday night we were at some friends being fairly active and then he came over to me to say his head hurt and within seconds he was asleep			1
' @entity2 can be randomly sick , have no energy at all , and lie on the sofa			0
next minute , he can be all right and active			0
' the condition is caused by a mutation on the @entity9 gene , and was only identified in 2005			1
it means that @entity2 can be vacant , twitch , and suffer from pains caused by the multiple cavernomas , or clusters of blood vessels , micro-haemorrhaging			2
mrs @entity60 said : ' the importance of the scan is that we can manage @entity2 's condition when things are not going well			2
so brave : little @entity8 , left , has had brain scans here , right , but needs to fly to the @entity7 for specialised help ' the type of @entity94 used is not available in the @entity95			2
it will show where the cavernomas are , how likely they are to haemorrhage , and what the side - effects of the bleeds could be			2
' it means that if @entity2 had a stroke the doctors could tell fairly quickly which of the cavernomas had haemorrhaged			0
' @entity2 's father said the boy has a 50 per cent chance of having a major stroke before he reaches 15			0
if he flies to @entity22 to be seen by @entity113 , his doctors in the @entity95 would then be able to call on the @entity7 doctor 's expertise at any time			1
a scan taken at @entity118 when @entity2 was first diagnosed highlighted 15 cavernomas in his brain , and further tests last year showed two more had developed			0
fifty per cent of patients with the condition begin having brain haemorrhages as children , and @entity2 falls into this category			2
@entity127 founded the @entity128 , which established the clinic in @entity22 that has offered anyone suffering from @entity9 to have a scan and consultation			1
dr @entity34 said : ' very little is known about @entity9 - the gene was discovered as recently as 2005 and the fact that this is an ultra-rare disorder was not clear until 2011			1
' because of this , the medical community is not familiar with management of the illness			0
' she added : ' @entity2 has already had a brain haemorrhage			0
he has at least 17 brain lesions and this number is expected to increase			0
' hence the need for dr @entity20 's expert management			0
' mr and mrs @entity60 and their daughters are trying to raise funds through bag - packing , skydiving , a football match and an autumn ball			0
they have set up a just giving page to encourage people to donate so they can raise enough to pay for them to take @entity2 to @entity22			1
the £ 5,000 target will pay for flights , accommodation , the scan and a consultation with dr @entity20			0
if more than £ 5,000 is raised , the surplus will go to the charity @entity164 @entity95			0
supporters who would like to get behind @entity2 and his parents are invited to make donations at www.justgiving.com/helpzane			0

@entity8 has @entity9 , a genetic mutation that could kill him at any time
fewer than 100 people are known to suffer from the little - known condition
his parents @entity33 , 38 , and @entity34 , 39 , need to take him to specialist in @entity22
