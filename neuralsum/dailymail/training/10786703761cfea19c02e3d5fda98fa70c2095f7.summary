flying a military drone in a warzone or other dangerous locations currently requires a team of human operators			0
but this could be about to change , as the @entity7 military looks to enable drones to hunt in ‘ coordinated packs ’ with minimal human supervision			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) will host a number of meetings in march to discuss how aircraft could work together to find , identify and engage targets with fewer humans controlling them			1
@entity11 is hosting meetings to discuss how aircraft could work together to find , identify and engage targets with fewer humans controlling them ( illustrated )			1
its ' code ' programme is also designed to cut the number of operators needed to control a single unmanned vehicle , allowing one person to operate six simultaneously the meeting is being called under the programme name ‘ collaborative operations in @entity27 ’ ( @entity25 )			2
@entity11 has invited ‘ participants with capabilities , methodologies , and approaches that are related to @entity25 research and focused on revolutionary approaches to unmanned aircraft systems , autonomy and collaborative operations , ’ to attend the discussion in @entity38 , @entity39			1
it said that the programme offers experts the opportunity to ‘ help develop groundbreaking software enabling unmanned aircraft to work together with minimal supervision ’			1

a current mq - 9 reaper drone used in @entity50 is pictured last january , the @entity7 @entity51 ( @entity52 ) revealed in its @entity53 for the next 25 years			1
it said that drones may be able to deviate from set missions , carry stronger chemical weapons and hunt in swarms in the years to come			2
at the moment , drones follow precise commands to complete a predetermined step - by - step mission , but the unmanned aircraft of the future could deviate from tasks , informed by ‘ laws ’ that govern their behaviour , laid out in algorithms and machine learning , as well as advanced sensors			1
they currently use gps to navigate war zones and remote areas , but the satellite signals used by the systems can be jammed easily , so @entity11 is working on jam - proof ‘ inertial guidance systems ’			2
the @entity52 's roadmap also features plans for deadly ‘ swarms ’ of drone - bombs that are launched from an unmanned ‘ mothership ’ to circle the skies while a human operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into , guided by the bots ’ on - bard cameras			1
thanks to the unmanned mothership , the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles ( 463km ) the roadmap said			0
the weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more deadly under the plans , as researchers are working on ‘ energetic nanoparticles ’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion			0
the technologies combined are intended to help the @entity7 military be ‘ more effective through greater automation and greater performance , ’ the report says			2
it seems to envision a time when groups of drones can work intelligently together under one human operator , who still makes big decisions , such as whether to attack a target , based on information gathered by the group			2
@entity119 - @entity118 , the program ’s manager , said : ‘ just as wolves hunt in coordinated packs with minimal communication , multiple code - enabled unmanned aircraft would collaborate to find , track , identify and engage targets , all under the command of a single human mission supervisor			1
’ noting that while current drones have proved ‘ invaluable ’ for gathering intelligence and tactical strikes , @entity11 said that most of them require constant control by a dedicated pilot who steers the craft and a sensor operator , as well as a large number of analysts			2
it takes a lot of manpower to control each craft and sift through information , which is expensive and can pose challenges in remote war zones with highly mobile targets			0
the experts think this problem can be overcome by using algorithms and software to ‘ extend the mission capabilities of existing unmanned aircraft well beyond the current state - of - the - art , ’ and make them more autonomous			1
it ’s hoped that experts can create software that can survive communications disruptions , and electronic warfare , while working with current drone designs			0

’ a demonstrator model of the @entity194 drone is shown designer @entity197 's @entity196 guide has been likened to 21st century bird watching last year , a @entity200 designer penned the @entity201 , which like bird watching charts , shows the various shapes and sizes of flying objects by their silhouettes			0
@entity197 ’s guide , however , details the differing kinds of flying robots used at war , as well as survival tips of how to hide from them			0
the majority of the drones selected for the chart are from @entity217 member countries , including the @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity7 and @entity221			0
this is because these countries have used drones in wars such as @entity50 and are also more transparent than some other countries in disclosing information about the robots , such as their wingspan			0
it uses a skull icon to show that a drone is used for attack and a little eye to denote a surveillance vehicle			0
the chart , which mr @entity197 describes as ‘ 21st century bird watching ’ shows the vast array of flying war machines used today from the giant 130ft ( 37 metre ) wingspan of the @entity242 drone to the petite @entity244 quadcopter , which measures just 23 inches ( 58cm )			0
he said : ‘ most drones are used today by military powers for remote - controlled surveillance and attack and their numbers are growing			0
' the @entity250 ( @entity250 ) predicted in 2012 that within 20 years there could be as many as 30,000 drones flying over @entity7 soil alone			2
‘ as robotic birds will become commonplace in the near future , we should be prepared to identify them			0
this survival guide is an attempt to familiarise ourselves and future generations , with a changing technological environment			0

@entity11 will host a number of meetings in march to discuss how drones could work together to find , identify and engage targets
aims to enable one human operator to control a pack of drones
software could ‘ extend the mission capabilities of existing unmanned aircraft , ’ and make them more autonomous
idea for drones that hunt in packs was *floated* in the @entity7 @entity51 's @entity53 for the next 25 years
