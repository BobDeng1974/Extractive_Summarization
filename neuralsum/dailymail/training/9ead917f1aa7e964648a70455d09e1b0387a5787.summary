by @entity0 published : 20:42 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 23:42 est , 5 november 2012 @entity0 and her children @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 at their home in @entity7 , @entity8			1
she has paid more than £ 100,000 in childcare over the years the other day i did something i should warn other working parents never , ever to try at home ( or anywhere else for that matter )			1
i whipped out a calculator and totted up the entire amount that childcare for my four children over the past 14 years has cost me			1
no doubt you will argue that i must already know what i am spending			2
indeed , i do — on a daily , monthly and , if i can bear it , annual basis			2
somehow it seems more palatable when broken into bite - sized chunks			2
what i have never before been brave enough to stomach is adding it all together to give a final , terrifying total			1
i say terrifying because it came to well over £ 100,000 , and for that amount i could have bought a house in some parts of @entity33 — something solid and tangible with four walls and a door			2
instead , i have nothing to show except an extremely precarious freelance journalism career and a shelf of bottles of dodgy eastern @entity42 liquor given to me as @entity43 presents by my many au pairs over the years			1
this is why @entity46 has become my new and very unlikely hero			1
this week , he vowed to make affordable childcare his number - one priority			1
the deputy prime minister says his announcement was prompted by the deluge of complaints from working parents he has received about the rising costs of childcare			1
in an email to supporters , @entity46 said : ‘ i want every parent who wants to work to be able to — without seeing every penny of their wages disappear in childcare bills			1
for me , the stark reality of choosing to bring four children into the world while clinging on to a career by my fingernails has meant i ’ve been bled dry			2
indeed , if i ’d known how expensive continuing to work would be , i ’d have put my feet up years ago			1
maybe it ’s easier for parents who have a fixed salary — they can budget what help they can afford and then decide whether they can afford to work at all			1
@entity0 spent the staggering sum on nurseries and au pairs in a bid to avoid stressful scenes like this of trying to work while caring for young children ( file picture ) and for those of us who are self - employed , it ’s a roller - coaster requiring nerves of steel or a helpful grandparent at the end of the road to take up the slack — neither of which i possess			1
if there ’s a bad month without much work , the costs still need to be met			1
for years , i ’ve been paying between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 a month for the privilege of simply doing my job — often at a loss			1
this has occasionally led to me taking desperate measures			2
i remember being forced to sell my dead grandmother ’s ring to pay a debt at my daughter ’s nursery			2
and i ’ve lost count of the number of times @entity46 has become an unlikely hero for @entity0 after pledging to cut childcare costs i ’ve withdrawn cash on a credit card to give to the au pair			1
i would honestly begrudge none of this if i felt it had all been money well spent			2
but the problem is that when you get other people to look after your children , there is always that unhelpful thought lurking in the back of your mind : ‘ could n’t i do a better job myself ? ’ when i had three children under the age of four , i used a combination of day care nurseries and au pairs			0
the rationale behind this was partly financial and partly common sense			0
au pairs are not qualified nannies and therefore should n’t take sole charge of small children for long periods of time			0
so the children would spend 8am to 2pm at the nursery — which is all we could afford , but it gave me the peace and quiet i needed to work from the house			0
then they would come back home and be looked after by the au pair during the afternoon if i needed to continue writing			1
this meant we kept those nursery costs down — which is just as well because they are exorbitant			1
depending on where you live , you can pay between £ 45 and £ 80 a day per child			0
this never ceased to amaze me when i visited such establishments , because they always seemed to be staffed by overweight 18 - year - old girls who doubtless had some nvq in bottom - wiping or whatever , but otherwise looked alarmingly inert			0
i remember picking up my eldest , @entity158 , now 14 , only to be horrified by the ‘ day - care lingo ’ she had picked up			0
i would spend hours undoing the damage , explaining to her that it was n’t a ‘ toilet ’ , it was a ‘ loo ’ , and that dinner is a meal you have in the evening , not at lunchtime			0
when each of my children hit the age of three , i transferred them from day care to a government pre-school nursery where they would be eligible for free sessions			0
@entity0 has added up the costs while this is a move designed to help working parents and amounts to around 15 hours a week free of charge , it only goes so far in being of any real use			1
most nurseries offering the government funding close at 3pm and for the entirety of every school holiday			0
that ’s why i ’ve always needed au pairs in addition to any childcare outside the house			1
but , boy , have they cost a fortune			0
i shudder to think how i have forked out £ 30,000 of hard - earned cash over the years to a stream of girls — most of whom have been totally incompetent			1
and this £ 80 per week does n’t include money spent on their food , electricity , @entity202 lessons and repairs to the bodywork of the car when they ’ve pranged it			0
@entity0 has spent a fortune on ' mostly useless ' au pairs and is yet to find her perfect @entity210 , pictured			1
let ’s start with the @entity212 who thought it was ok to take my two daughters — then aged two and five — shopping in the town centre in bare feet because ‘ that ’s the way we do things back home ’			1
then there was the @entity223 girl who borrowed the car , drove a 50 - mile round trip to a @entity227 nightclub and brought two squaddies she ’d picked up back to her bed in my home ( leaving me no petrol for the school run )			2
not forgetting the @entity234 girl who stole £ 200 from my children ’s piggy banks , oh , and the @entity238 one who had a fling with @entity240 in our spare bedroom ( no , i ’m not making this up )			0
then , last , but by no means least , the @entity246 — or was it @entity248 ? — au pair who made game efforts to nab my husband , but settled , instead , for one of his friends			0
of course , things are much easier now that my older three — @entity158 , 14 , @entity3 , 11 , and @entity4 , nine — are at school			0
now , there is just three - year - old @entity5 ’s nursery to pay for			0
it ’s money well spent , apart from one small niggle			0
government guidelines dictate that nursery staff can no longer use the word ‘ naughty ’			0
this , apparently , is a potentially damaging statement against a child ’s personality			0
so , if @entity5 does something wilfully disobedient she must be told that her ‘ behaviour ’ has made staff a ‘ little bit sad ’			0
there is no naughty chair or naughty step			0
the word has been banished			0
well , it makes me a ‘ little bit sad ’ that my daughter is spending the majority of her week in an environment where common sense no longer seems to prevail			0
but what can i do ? like every working mother across @entity33 i must write out my cheque and hope for the best that she will be well looked after and maybe even a little loved			2
because no matter how much money comes in or goes out again on childcare , i will always feel a tinge of guilt that the job i ’ve chosen to do will never be the most important job in the world .			2
