the number of children adopted under four years old has gone up by 70 per cent since 2010			1
( file image ) the number of children adopted from state care has risen by almost 60 per cent in four years to more than 5,000 – the highest level since modern records began			1
it is a triumph for former education secretary @entity10 ’s new rules sweeping away barriers blocking adoption on racial or bureaucratic grounds			1
figures released yesterday showed 5,050 children were adopted in the year to the end of march , an increase of 26 per cent in a year and 58 per cent since 2010			0
the number of children adopted under four years old has gone up by 70 per cent since 2010			2
there are now more adoptions than at any time since comparable records began in 1992			1
the breakthrough follows years of decline in adoption as social workers insisted children in state care should only go to families of the same racial or cultural background			1
adoptions were also blocked on the grounds that prospective parents were too old , or that they smoked , or even that they were too middle class			1
critics said children were being damaged by being forced to live in care homes or with a succession of foster families because social workers had an ideological dislike of adoption			2
after the appointment in 2010 of mr @entity10 – who was brought up by adoptive parents – guidance was changed to speed up adoption and remove barriers such as race , age or class			1
adoption falls under children ’s services covered by the @entity52			0
education secretary @entity53 , who replaced mr @entity10 in july , said the rise in adoptions – which had fallen to 3,100 in 2011 – meant thousands more vulnerable children were finding homes			2
she said : ' these figures show a significant and sustained rise in the number of adoptions – an increase of 26 per cent in the last twelve months			0
' this means thousands more of our most vulnerable of children finding the loving and permanent homes they so desperately need			0
‘ we also promised to remove delay and frustration from the process for both children and adopters			0
today ’s figures show that we are delivering on that promise			0
education secretary @entity53 , left , who replaced mr @entity10 , right , in july , said the rise in adoptions – which had fallen to 3,100 in 2011 – meant thousands more vulnerable children were finding homes ' the system is working more quickly , as well as providing more support to families after an adoption has taken place			1
’ on average a child entering the care system who is adopted waited two years of four months before becoming legally part of their new family			2
however , the waiting time has gone down by two months over the past year			0
the difficulties for children brought up in state care who do not win adoption can be highly damaging			1
in 2012 figures showed that a third of children living long - term in state care failed to learn to read by the time they were seven			1
seven out of eight failed to reach the benchmark for a decent education , five @entity101 passes at @entity104 or equivalent including @entity105 and maths			0
one in five were not up to date with immunisations , and almost the same proportion had not been to a dentist in a year			0
yesterday ’s figures showed that among 27,220 young people who spent their childhood in the care system and are now aged 19,20 , and 21 , nearly four out of 10 are @entity114 – not in education , employment or training			0
figures also showed the number of children in care rose to 68,840 last year , up by seven per cent on 2010 levels .			2

number adopted from state care at highest level since records began in 1992
