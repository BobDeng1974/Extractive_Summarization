@entity7 and @entity8 were camping in october 2012 when their five - year - old dog ran away			1
they ended up posting fliers and even set up a @entity14 page for her , hoping against hope that somebody somewhere would find her			1
despite receiving no responses , they continued to hold out hope			0
remembering the search that had taken place years earlier , the @entity36 were notified and drove to the campsite			0
they even decide to leave their dogs ' old bed and some clothing with the campground host in the hope the dog might sniff them out			1
the plan worked ! a week later , the host of the campsite found @entity4 had been sleeping on the blanket and curling up in clothing they had left behind			1
glimmer : earlier this month , a camper at @entity32 saw the dog five miles from where she had gone missing			1
upon being notified , the @entity58 immediately drove from their home in @entity61 to the site we 're glad to have you back : @entity65 says the family are completely shocked and amazed with the miracle of having @entity4 back the @entity58 wrote that the campsite host had even been able to coax her into a kennel			1
