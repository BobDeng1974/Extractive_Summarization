by @entity1 correspondent the @entity2 has admitted overpaying one in eight of its employees and allowing the wage bill for junior staff to soar by £ 35million in three years			1
while the @entity9 repeatedly boasts that it is cutting back on top - level salaries , new figures show it has simultaneously allowed its middle management to become increasingly bloated			1
thousands of employees now earn more than they are entitled to under the @entity2 ’s own pay grade system , leading to accusations it is allowing costs to spiral out of control			1
confession : the @entity2 has admitted overpaying one in eight of its employees and allowing the wage bill for junior staff to soar by £ 35million in three years			1
above , the @entity9 's headquarters in @entity23 , @entity24 figures released under the @entity25 of its 17,447 staff earn more than their pay grade allows			1
critics suggested the practice of overpaying middle managers and more junior staff allows the corporation to boast it is cutting senior posts while continuing to pay inflated salaries			1
last night @entity38 mp @entity37 , who sits on the @entity39 , said the figures show the @entity2 is ‘ never knowingly underpaid ’			0
she added : ‘ i honestly find it extraordinary that the @entity2 is breaking its own rules on pay			2
we had been led to believe it was only a handful of staff at the top who were being overpaid			0
now it seems the rot runs much deeper			0
’ surprised : last night @entity38 mp @entity37 said the new figures show the @entity2 is ' never knowingly underpaid ' the @entity2 divides its staff into 18 pay bands			1
the top two , which include senior managers and top presenters , have seen their numbers slashed after director general @entity58 vowed to cut the proportion of executives to around one per cent of the workforce			0
between 2009 and 2013 the number of senior managers was reduced from 640 to 429 , although a further 216 jobs need to go to hit the target			0
but the amount spent on lower levels has risen			0
the pay bill for employees on the rung below senior management – known as ‘ band 11 ’ – increased by a fifth to £ 65.5million in the past three years			1
of them , 61 per cent are given more than the salary ceiling of £ 73,888			0
the next rung down includes 1,325 staff , including many of the @entity2 ’s on - air journalists			1
‘ @entity77 ’ cost the @entity2 almost £ 97million in 2012/13			2
almost half of those were paid more than the agreed salary ceiling of £ 66,460			0
the @entity2 denied that it is simply reclassifying senior managers at a lower grade but giving them the same pay to artificially reduce executive numbers			2
a spokesman said those earning above their pay band were either ‘ long serving members of staff ’ or had a special ‘ skill - set ’			2
' while these salary bands are internal guidelines only , we have consistently reduced the number of staff earning outside the guided amount since 2010 in these grades , ' the spokesman said			0
' however , there continues to be members of staff who possess a skill - set that commands a higher market premium than the guide for their grade			0
