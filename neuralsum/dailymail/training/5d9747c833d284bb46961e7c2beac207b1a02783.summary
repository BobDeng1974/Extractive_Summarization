by @entity0 published : 18:39 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 18:39 est , 6 august 2013 the @entity1 today looks set to announce that interest rates could stay at record lows until after the @entity4			1
@entity5 , who succeeded lord @entity6 as governor last month having been hand - picked for the job by @entity9 , is expected to reassure the public that rates will not rise anytime soon			2
the @entity12 hopes the use of so - called ‘ forward guidance ’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery			2
the chancellor will also hope that rock bottom borrowing costs between now and polling day in 2015 will bolster @entity23 chances as house prices rise and optimism returns			0
tough balancing act : @entity5 with his wife @entity27 but the prospect of at least two more years of low interest rates will delight borrowers but inflict further misery on savers who have lost out since rates hit 0.5 per cent in march 2009			1
it will mark a dramatic change of tack at the bank which has until now resisted tying its hands by committing to a future path of interest rates			1
experts warned that if the economy picks up sharply in the coming months the @entity1 could be forced to renege on its promise and raise interest rates sooner than expected - particularly if inflation roars back			1
it means mr @entity5 , the highest paid central banker in the world on £ 874,000 a year , faces a difficult balancing act when he outlines his plans today at the @entity1 ’s inflation report			2
it is thought that he could peg low interest rates to economic thresholds - such as saying they will not rise until unemployment falls below a certain level as has been done in the @entity57 by the @entity58			1
the prospect of at least two more years of low interest rates will inflict further misery on savers who have lost out since rates hit 0.5 per cent in march 2009 but @entity61 , senior market strategist at @entity63 trading firm @entity62 , said the ‘ better economic data has complicated the plans of mr @entity5 ’			1
the bank looks set to raise its growth forecasts for this year and next following a flurry of better economic news in recent months			0
but output is still around three per cent below the pre-recession peak reached in early 2008 - meaning this is the longest downturn for a century			0
mr @entity5 is also likely to be concerned that @entity72 has been the worst performing economy in the @entity74 since the start of the financial crisis bar @entity77			0
it could be enough to persuade him to press ahead with forward guidance today when he responds to mr @entity9 ’s request to consider ‘ unconventional ’ tools to boost the economy			0
mr @entity5 , former governor of the @entity12 central bank , gave a clear taste of forward guidance last month when he signalled that interest rates will not rise for some time			1
the @entity1 ’s @entity86 ( @entity86 ) said expectations of an imminent rate rise were ‘ not warranted ’ - sending stock markets soaring			0
business leaders welcomed the prospect of full - blown forward guidance last night			1
@entity93 , deputy director - general of the @entity94 , said : ‘ forward guidance could provide a welcome injection of certainty around interest rates for businesses and consumers			1
’ @entity101 , chief economist at the @entity102 , said : ‘ businesses need a stable environment with reassurance that interest rates will remain at very low levels for the foreseeable future			1
’ @entity108 , managing director at investment bank @entity109 , said : ‘ we still expect @entity5 to introduce forward guidance , probably along with a target for the unemployment rate , reinforcing the view of a @entity115 likely stuck at 0.5 per cent until just after the @entity4			0
’ @entity116 , an economist at banking group @entity117 , said forward guidance would be a useful tool to prevent expectations of higher interest rates ‘ choking off the recovery story ’			2
but a critic said it could pave the way for problems in the future if the @entity1 is forced to change its mind and raise rates due to economic developments			2
former @entity86 member @entity131 said : ‘ this is a very difficult environment for central banks wishing to design forward guidance and we should not build up our hopes about its accuracy or effectiveness			0
’ @entity140 , economist at @entity141 , said : ‘ it does n’t take long to see how messy things could get			0
the decision would only add to the confusion over when rates are likely to rise			0

interest rates could stay low until after *election*
@entity1 governor hopes it will boost consumer confidence
business leaders welcome move
