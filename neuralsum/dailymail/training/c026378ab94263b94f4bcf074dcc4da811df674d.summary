dramatically , and perhaps decisively , @entity0 poked the nose of his @entity2 ahead of @entity3 to win the @entity4			1
the moment the @entity6 seized the race – and moved significantly closer to the world title itself – came in the 24th lap at the @entity11 , his run down to the inside of left hairpin at the end of the back straight too brisk and too daring for his team - mate to withstand			1
@entity0 ’s victory under the @entity21 sun was his fifth in succession and 32nd of his career – making him , in terms of grand prix wins , the most successful @entity28 driver in @entity30 history , eclipsing @entity31 , and in 41 fewer races			1
but it is not race victories that @entity0 is most avidly chasing but a second world title that would put him behind only sir @entity36 , who was watching from the paddock in his trademark tartan trews , in the pantheon of our motor racing greats			1
there are 75 still available , with @entity90 the next call on sunday and @entity92 a fortnight later , when points ludicrously count double			2
so the mathematics says that the contest is far from over , but the psychology says it is			2
@entity3 has provided @entity0 a far tougher test than many imagined possible at the start of the season yet ultimately he may have to concede defeat to @entity0 ’s one stupendous gift : improbable speed			1
@entity0 , starting second , had little chance at the start to sweep past @entity3 , who had claimed pole position so strongly			1
the pole side of the track here , heading into the giant first corner climb , is a bigger advantage than usual and @entity3 had got away cleanly			1
but , as the @entity113 admitted afterwards , he was struggling for rhythm			2
but he still emerged clearly ahead after the first round of pit stops			2
at that stage his lead was 2.5sec			0
but @entity0 refused to give up			1
with his race - stealing move , he made the event worthwhile in front of the @entity45 fans he has taken to heart			1
@entity0 ( right ) overtakes his @entity113 team - mate @entity3 ( left ) to take the lead in the decisive move of the race despite starting behind him on the grid , @entity0 got the better of @entity3 in the early stages after the start before overtaking @entity0 comes through the home straight in position one , 2.6 seconds ahead of @entity3 on lap 14 @entity0 leads the field at the @entity45 @entity4 in @entity50 , @entity21 , on sunday @entity134 closes in on title 1 @entity0 ( @entity28 ) 316 2 @entity3 ( @entity113 ) 292 3 @entity46 ( @entity136 ) 214 4 @entity66 ( @entity137 ) 155 5 @entity69 ( @entity113 ) 149 6 @entity67 ( @entity138 ) 149 7 @entity77 ( @entity28 ) 94 8 @entity64 ( @entity139 ) 83 9 @entity82 ( @entity113 ) 76 10 @entity70 ( @entity140 ) 53 points on offer in last two races @entity139 : 1st = 25 ; 2nd = 18 ; 3rd = 15 ; 4th = 12 ; 5th = 10 ; 6th = 8 ; 7th = 6 ; 8th = 4 ; 9th = 2 ; 10th = 1 @entity92 ( double points ) : 1st = 50 ; 2nd = 36 ; 3rd = 30 ; 4th = 24 ; 5th = 20 ; 6th = 16 ; 7th = 12 ; 8th = 8 ; 9th = 4 ; 10th = 2 @entity3 ( front left ) got a strong start from pole position ahead of his @entity2 team - mate @entity0 @entity3 ( centre ) leads the field out for the first laps of the @entity45 @entity4 in @entity50 @entity3 ( front left ) got a good jump on his rivals on the grid , with world championship leader @entity0 on his tail the 18 - car field gathers as they make their way out of turn one at the @entity160 32 @entity0 2007 - 31 @entity31 1980 - 95 27 @entity36 1965 - 73 25 @entity161 1960 - 68 22 @entity162 1992 - 99 @entity163 1950 - 62 15 @entity77 2000 - 14 @entity164 1958 - 75 13 @entity165 1994 - 2008 ‘ i was just waiting for the moment to throw it up the inside , ’ he said			1
‘ i was deciding how much of a risk to take			0
@entity3 was not defending and i almost caught him unawares			1
’ at the end he safely picked his way through the backmarkers – even with financially stricken @entity172 and @entity173 missing there were some – to secure his third victory in @entity45			2
@entity46 , the rising star of @entity63 , was third in another impressive drive but he never looked like overhauling either of the @entity2 with their superior engines			1
the race itself was balm after the fevered talk of a possible boycott by @entity75 , @entity84 and @entity80 to highlight their demands for a greater share of @entity30 ’s revenues			1
but , lo and behold , when the last strains of the @entity187 faded , and the marching band with their sousaphones and assorted brass marched off the grid , every single car took part			2
but it took no time for the field to be reduced			0
ironically , it was two of the rebels whose cars retired			0
@entity85 had a rush of blood in front of about 10,000 fans who had made the short trip from his homeland of @entity207 to cheer him on			0
he hit the @entity68 of @entity78 from behind and skewed into @entity86 ’s @entity80			1
@entity78 ’s machine was no more than bruised and he continued			0
@entity85 ’s car was mangled			0
the safety car was deployed for two laps until bits of broken chassis were cleared			0
the safety car drives in front of @entity0 and @entity3 after the lap one incident which saw the exit of @entity86 a familiar sight this season of the two @entity2 doing battle , with @entity3 leading @entity0 until the @entity223 claimed the lead @entity136 's @entity63 driver put @entity2 on notice recording the fastest lap in the middle section of the race @entity84 driver @entity85 brings his damaged car into the pits after a collision with @entity80 's @entity86 on lap one @entity0 applauds and shows his delight after a near - flawless performance that makes him @entity28 's most successful driver @entity0 steps down from his vehicle as the world 's photographers capture yet another winning moment for the @entity241 @entity0 shares his win with his pit crew after finishing one - two yet again with @entity3 @entity244 friday , nov 7 practice 1 : 12pm practice 2 : 4pm saturday , nov 8 practice 3 : 1pm qualifying : 4pm sunday , nov 9 @entity4 : 4pm @entity249 friday , nov 21 practice 1 : 9am practice 2 : 1pm saturday 22 practice 3 : 10am qualifying : 1pm sunday , nov 23 @entity4 : 1pm @entity84 ’s participation ended in the 18th lap when @entity82 ground to a halt on the back straight			1
so they did not need a boycott to sit out most of the race			2
as for the boycott threat , it was a farrago that could have walked straight off the pages of @entity266 ’s scoop			0
if a correspondent in @entity269 reported that war had broken out , war broke out			0
the story begat the event , not vice versa			0
here reports of a possible boycott added impetus to a fanciful notion			0
nobody was ever serious about going on strike in the most important marketplace in the sport			0
but the conspirators loved the spotlight the speculation shone on their complaints so went along with it			0
there is talk of a possible resolution between the malcontents and @entity291 and the sport ’s owners cvc in the next few says			0
if there is none we could go through the same charade in @entity139 next sunday			0
back to the sharp end of the title fight			0
@entity0 , who donned a sheriff ’s hat after his win , can now afford to finish second in both the final races and claim the title			2
@entity63 's @entity69 , winner of last year 's @entity4 in @entity21 , poses with the @entity306 prior to sunday 's race the @entity306 wear @entity21 - style wide - brimmed hats as they parade in the lead - up to the race the grid assistants all wear matching cowgirl boots as they walk in single file to the pit lane			1

@entity0 won the @entity45 @entity4 at the @entity160 in @entity50 , @entity21
@entity2 team - mate @entity3 was second while @entity63 's @entity46 completed the *podium* in third
@entity3 started the race in pole position ahead of team - mate @entity0 in second and @entity66 in third
@entity80 's @entity86 crashed out on the first lap having won his team 's first top 10 grid place in qualifying
@entity0 now leads @entity3 by 24 points in the world championship race with two venues remaining
