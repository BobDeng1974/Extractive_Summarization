@entity0 looks ahead to sunday ’s showdown between the @entity2 and the @entity3 at @entity4			1
the game is the first of three @entity8 contests being held in @entity9 this season			1
the @entity8 games are completely different from anything that @entity8 teams are used to			1
the @entity4 atmosphere is something that surprises young players when they walk into the stadium			1
they think they are walking into an arena where the fans are inexperienced but , in fact , the @entity4 fans are just as knowledgeable and more excited than @entity25 fans			1
the veterans who i have spoken to say it is not too dissimilar an atmosphere to the @entity30			0
as an event , the @entity8 at @entity4 is phenomenal			1
i ’m like a pig in muck because , after watching the @entity34 win the @entity30 in 1985 , i went to all the pre-season games that were called @entity36			1
it did n’t really mean anything but we got to see @entity40 and @entity41 on the field for two minutes			0
after the @entity43 and @entity44 , we have now established @entity4 as the home of @entity46 in the @entity47			1
we have three games this season and i am hearing we will have five next year			1
after that , we can start to predict how many season tickets we will sell for an eight - game season			2
the @entity3 landed in @entity52 on monday and have been training at @entity53 all week the @entity3 are searching for their first win of the season and fancy their their chances against the @entity2 there is some talk that the @entity8 has set a date that there will be a team in @entity9 by 2022			1
i think that gives them enough time to survey , study , and try to judge how much interest there will be in the game			2
but i still think that it is too far away			0
let ’s try and take advantage of the momentum we have now			0
3 – 40ft containers are shipped from the @entity25 for each @entity4 game 15 – the number of days it takes for the containers to travel from @entity25 to @entity52 9,600 – bottles of @entity79 are used for each game , 400 cases 8,000 - weight in kilograms of gameday equipment used 360 – the number of balls that are shipped to @entity52 for use 5,787 – jerseys were sold during two @entity8 games last season 3,831 – caps were also sold during two @entity4 weekends in 2013 there is no expense spared for the fan experience during @entity4 week			1
to take over @entity95 on the saturday before the game must cost a fortune - they spent £ 250,000 on banners alone last season			2
my first ever @entity99 was in 1986 or 1987 when i literally dragged my dad along to @entity4 with my brother			1
but one thing i have noticed when i sit in the crowd for these @entity8 games is that it is dads dragging kids			1
there are n’t many kids at the @entity4 games and we need to start encouraging them to come along			1
both the @entity2 and @entity3 are struggling			1
it is a very similar situation to when we hosted the @entity113 against the @entity115 last season			2
both teams were n’t doing very well and it turned out to be one of the best games we have had at @entity4			1
i am hoping that will be the same on sunday			2
the @entity2 are one of the most supported teams in the @entity47 so there will be plenty of their fans there			1
@entity126 has all the talent and will be looking to bounce back after a turbulent week with the @entity2 @entity128 is starting for the @entity3 at @entity4 with @entity129 remaining in the @entity25 for personal reasons @entity2 vs @entity3 , 6pm ( @entity4 ) @entity131 at @entity132 , 6pm @entity133 at @entity134 , 6pm @entity135 at @entity136 , 6pm @entity137 at @entity138 , 6pm @entity139 at @entity140 , 6pm @entity141 at @entity115 , 6pm @entity142 at @entity143 , 9.05pm @entity144 at @entity145 , 9.25pm @entity146 at @entity147 , 9.25pm @entity148 at @entity149 , 1.30am i think @entity152 ’s issues lie with their offensive line			1
they are not strong at all and @entity155 has injured his knee			0
he is a real loss for them			0
but they still have issues at quarterback , too			0
@entity126 has shown great promise but is still inconsistent			0
i played golf on friday with @entity164 - a member of @entity152 ’s 1972 undefeated team			1
he said that the problem the @entity2 have got is inconsistency and that they do n’t have any real leaders to take them forward			2
for the @entity3 , i do n’t think @entity128 at quarterback is a solution			2
but they have got that thing the @entity3 have always lived and breathed on is that they bring in experienced and veteran players			2
i met @entity175 on wednesday and he is really charismatic			0
he was saying it is really different for them to come over here and play football on foreign soil			0
the set up is different and it is a different experience for the guys , but they are trying to embrace it as , in @entity175 ’s words , “ an opportunity to get that first @entity186 ”			0
the @entity2 flew in on friday and they will not have acclimatised as well as the @entity3			1
they practiced in 90 - degree heat in @entity152 earlier in the week , but they are coming to @entity4 where it will be overcast			1
i think the @entity3 will win			1
i have got a feeling that everything that has gone wrong for them so far this season will come right on sunday			2
meeting @entity196 @entity197 and @entity0 chew the fat i met @entity197 for the first time on wednesday and he said he has got 30 or 40 family tickets for the game because a lot of them have never seen him play			1
physically , he is massive			0
i put some pictures of us on @entity206 , and he is an absolute monster			0
he enjoys @entity46 because of the physical aspect of it			0
i watched him at practice as i wanted to see how he was getting on			0
he really stood up for himself			0
i was really surprised how good he was because , considering he has n’t played a lot of football , technically he is quite good			0
he is quick and has fast hands , which is what you need as an offensive lineman and he just needs to learn the game			0
he is really proud to be representing @entity218 and is doing massive things			1
the process of player selection is quite elitist because if you do n’t get into college then it is hard to get into the league			0
but there has to be a way for international players with the physical abilities and the right attributes to be @entity46 players to get onto teams			0
@entity197 embraces @entity233 after the @entity3 sank to a narrow 16 - 9 defeat to the @entity235 last week quarterback showdown in the sunday night game on @entity239 between the @entity240 and @entity241 , we have got two great quarterbacks with very different public opinions			1
@entity244 has won a @entity30 with the @entity240 and is a record breaker			0
it seems that whenever we see @entity244 play , he is always breaking records			0
it just shows what a good quarterback he is			0
the incomparable @entity244 leaves the field after leading the @entity240 to victory over the vikings @entity256 's season has been plagued by turnovers as the inconsistent @entity241 bid to improve their fortunes on the flip side , we have @entity256 for the @entity241			2
i was never a big @entity256 fan but this season i have started to feel a bit sorry for him			2
if you watch him , you can tell how frustrated he gets			0
@entity256 has got a brand new offensive line and it ’s taking them some time to bed in			2
when i saw them against the 49ers they were very good against one of the strongest defenses in the league			0
but with @entity256 , it ’s not his highlights that are under the magnifying glass , it is his mistakes and interceptions that everyone picks up on			0
@entity239 will broadcast live coverage of the @entity2 against the @entity3 from @entity4 on sunday night as well as the @entity240 against the @entity241			1
@entity0 presents @entity8 : the @entity282 , mondays at 11pm on @entity239 .			2

@entity2 take on @entity3 at @entity4 on sunday
contest is first of three @entity8 games this season in @entity9
*raiders* have lost first three games and @entity2 have just one win
@entity152 flew in late and have had less time to acclimatise than @entity3
next season , i am hearing we will have five games in @entity9
@entity3 's @entity197 is very proud to represent @entity218 in the @entity8
