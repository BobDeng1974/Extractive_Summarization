by @entity0 schools should teach pupils to speak eloquently to help ‘ grunting ’ and ‘ monosyllabic ’ teenagers , according to a former speechwriter for @entity5			0
@entity6 argued that not enough teaching time was devoted to developing speaking skills and criticised an assumption that quiet classrooms were best			1

( picture posed by models ) mr @entity6 , who is now a head teacher of a @entity19 free school , said schools needed to help ‘ dispel the myth of the grunting teenager , the monosyllabic teenager			1
’ he also criticised last year ’s decision to remove the speaking and listening mark from the final grade in gcse @entity27 , pointing out that oral exams were still regarded as intrinsic to foreign language qualifications			2
learning to speak eloquently was becoming ‘ a moral issue ’ because it is crucial to success in life , he told the @entity35			0
‘ if you can speak and articulate yourself properly , that will happen , ’ he said			0
‘ but it ’s also the number one issue that employers put in all their surveys : they want good oral communication			0
’ mr @entity6 ( above ) , who is now a head teacher of a @entity19 free school , criticised last year 's decision to remove the speaking and listening mark from the final grade in gcse @entity27 he added : ‘ we ’ve got to dispel the myth of the grunting teenager , the monosyllabic teenager that make employers say “ i ’ve got this person who i know on paper is quite good , but they ca n’t string a sentence together ”			1
’ mr @entity6 , who now runs school 21 , a new free school in @entity58 , east @entity19 , said the general trend was moving further away from encouraging pupils to develop their speaking and communication skills			1
a fashion for quiet classrooms is wrong and pupils should spend time discussing ideas and debating with each other , he insisted			2
‘ speaking aids thinking , speaking aids depth of knowledge , speaking aids writing , ’ he said			2
‘ i think some people out there think the silent classroom is the good classroom , but the silent classroom is the death of learning , unless there ’s a particular reason for it			0
’ mr @entity6 added : ‘ i think there ’s too much of a fashion now of saying " the quieter the better , that shows you ’ve got behaviour under control "			1
‘ i think that is completely the wrong way to go and we ’ve got to put speaking up there on a completely equal footing with reading and writing			0
’ mr @entity6 told @entity35 that he wanted to go around the classrooms of his school , and hear children talking to each other , discussing , debating and questioning			1
the spoken word , he said , was ‘ built into the dna of the school ’			0
mr @entity6 made the remarks part - way through a pilot project with the @entity107 which is testing a range of ways teachers can boost and assess students ’ talking skills			1
professor @entity113 , director of the project , said policy makers would take speech more seriously as a subject if it could be formally assessed			0
‘ the government has tended to blow hot and cold on talk in schools , ’ he said			0
‘ it tends to be taken for granted , but it ’s important to children ’s development in so many ways			0
‘ speaking and listening is included in the primary curriculum now but in secondary it is there in a token way and not nearly enough to develop children ’s life skills			2
