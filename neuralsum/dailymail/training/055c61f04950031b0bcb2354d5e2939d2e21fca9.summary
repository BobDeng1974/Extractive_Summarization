the man known as ‘ @entity1 ’ in these parts is determined to make a name for himself by ending his run of dismal form and showing @entity6 that @entity7 really can play one - day cricket			1
the slip of the tongue from @entity13 ’s @entity12 mayor @entity11 somehow summed up @entity15 ’s anonymity during a horrid spell when he has not stayed at the crease long enough for anyone to take note of his name			2
@entity15 is not one to take offence at the mayor ’s faux pas - ‘ i ’ve been called a lot worse , ’ he smiled on wednesday - but he knows how important it would be for him to make an indelible impression on @entity6 on friday ( 1am gmt )			1
‘ i ’d love you to explain it because i do n’t understand it , ’ said @entity15 of his run of four ducks in his last five innings			1
‘ i try to keep things simple			0
you do n’t look any further than what ’s in front of you and i ’ve done that but it has n’t worked			0
@entity15 is determined to turn his recent lean run of form around when @entity7 face @entity6 @entity15 remains confident despite scoring four ducks in his last five innings in one - dayers in @entity45 ‘ i believe it will work and when it does hopefully i can cash in and make it either a match - winning performance or build on somebody else ’s			1
i ’ve certainly done the same things i ’ve been doing since the start of the tour and i began it with a hundred			0
that ’s only five games ago			0
’ it must seem like an eternity to @entity15 despite his relaxed persona			2
he does not look short of confidence but he knows how erosive it can be for a captain to struggle having succeeded one who was struggling in @entity65			0
‘ i think the fact i ’ve been through bad patches before has helped , ’ said @entity15 , who lost his @entity67 place three years ago when his technique collapsed against @entity69			2
he is not the only one who needs a performance at the @entity74 in a game where @entity7 need a vast improvement from their capitulation at the hands of @entity45			1
last summer @entity7 ’s test form dramatically improved after a dismal start to the summer when the more experienced players found their feet and @entity15 called on those around him to deliver now			1
@entity15 says going through bad patches in the past , including losing his @entity67 place , are an advantage @entity15 called on his fellow senior players to deliver as @entity7 push to turn their fortunes around before his run of two runs in five innings , @entity15 reminded reporters again of his 121 in @entity92 ‘ our senior players will need to stand up , ’ said @entity15 when looking ahead to the challenge of facing what looks like a formidable @entity6 side			1
‘ we didn ’ t do it at the @entity100 which was disappointing			0
guys like myself , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 need to make contributions in order to make the young guys feel comfortable within themselves			0
‘ there is a sense of frustration			0
these first two games in particular are great practice for the later stages			0
if we can get wins under our belt against good opposition it can breed confidence for later in the tour			0
’ @entity7 might want to think about getting to those later stages first if they are convincingly beaten again			2
another defeat would crank up the pressure before they play @entity122 in @entity123 on monday in what would then be a game where @entity7 could not afford any slip ups			1
at least @entity15 had one bit of good news in his recruitment by @entity130 of the @entity131 this week , where he will play alongside @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			2
@entity7 's experienced members including @entity136 ( left ) and @entity137 must take the lead a big knock from the likes of @entity141 would help ' make the young guys feel comfortable within themselves ' but even that is not without controversy because , as revealed by @entity145 in @entity146 , it means @entity15 will miss @entity7 ’s one - day international against @entity147 on may 8 because of a clash with the @entity131			1
and he had said earlier on this tour that the @entity131 would not effect his @entity7 commitments			2
‘ the national selector ( @entity152 ) and managing director ( @entity153 ) have allowed guys who have got picked up in the @entity131 to miss that game in order to expose themselves to opportunities and learn more about their game			0
’ but surely the @entity7 captain is a different case ? ‘ no , i do n’t think it is , ’ insisted @entity15			1
‘ if you ’re being a little short - sighted it might do but i think in the longer term it will serve me well			0
’ well , call me myopic but i think that is wrong			0
yes , the scheduling of the match in @entity171 is ridiculous , straight after @entity7 ’s @entity173 tour , but the captain should be with his team			1
for now that issue can wait because @entity15 might not even be @entity7 captain by then if his side go out in the first round of this @entity180 .			1

@entity7 skipper @entity15 remains confident despite poor run of form
he called on fellow senior players including @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity141 to deliver and give a boost the younger players
