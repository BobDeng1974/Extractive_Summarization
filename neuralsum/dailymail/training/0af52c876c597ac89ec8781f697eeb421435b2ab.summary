a carpenter who spent three years and more than Â£ 1million building a full - scale replica of @entity2 has opened it to the public			1
as many as 3,000 tourists a day can step aboard @entity7 ' gigantic wooden boat in @entity8 , in the @entity9 , which now boasts two cinemas and a restaurant alongside its menagerie of life - sized plastic animals			1
mr @entity7 was inspired to embark on the ambitious project after having a dream in which he saw part of his native @entity9 submerged in a flood like the one featured in the @entity18			2
faithful recreation : @entity7 's replica of the ark , in @entity8 , in the western @entity9 , is now open to the public miracle worker : mr @entity7 poses with two of the life - size plastic animals that live on his 450ft ark he became obsessed with bringing the story of the @entity7 to life , and in 2004 he built a half - scale version and floated it along the country 's canals			1
long before the metric or imperial systems came along , craftsmen in various parts of the world dealt in less precise units known as cubits			0
as this was based on the length of a forearm , the exact value varies from one ancient civilisation to the next			0
it is most commonly defined as the distance from the elbow to the middle fingertip			0
the @entity49 cubit is generally thought to be about 18in , but @entity51 cubit rods measure closer to 20in			0
tourists flocked to see the smaller prototype when mr @entity7 opened it to the public , but the proceeds from admissions went straight back into funding his ambition to build a full - size ship			1
the narrative of the ark , in which @entity62 commands @entity63 to prepare for a great flood sent to purge the world of evil , specifies that the boat was 300 cubits long , 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high			2
mr @entity7 converted this ancient unit of measurement , which is based on the length of the forearm , to determine that his recreation had to be about 450ft long			0
this puts the boat , nicknamed ' @entity7 ' , at more than half the length of the @entity75			2
and though it may not be able to shelter two of every animal , as the original story dictates , it can hold 1,500 people - not to mention a menagerie of plastic creatures including giraffes , elephants and donkeys , as well as a few live chickens			0
two by two : a crocodile and cow are among the fake creatures on board the boat , which weighs almost 3,000 tons biblical proportions : a plastic giraffe pokes its head over the bow of the ark , which was inspired by a dream as it weighs in at almost 3,000 tons and is made from @entity100 pine reinforced with steel , it may be hard to believe that the ark is , in fact , seaworthy			2
it is docked in the western city of @entity8 , where mr @entity7 , the owner of a construction company , pieced it together with the help of some friends and two of his children			1
in the 15th century , the city was the site of one of the deadliest floods in history , named @entity118 's flood , which is thought to have claimed as many as 10,000 lives			0
prototype : the half - scale replica that mr @entity7 built in 2004 , later floating it through the @entity9 ' canals ambition : mr @entity7 stands in front of two model elephants on his first ship in 2007 @entity18 : a mural from the mid- 16th century shows @entity62 ordering @entity63 to load two of every animal on to his ark to avoid the imminent @entity133			1

@entity135 @entity7 spent three years building the gigantic wooden boat , which holds an array of life - size plastic animals
ark in @entity8 is now open to *visitors* , and features two cinemas and a restaurant
