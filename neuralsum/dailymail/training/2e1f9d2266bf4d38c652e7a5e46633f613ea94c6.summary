a greeting card company hoping for a laugh used a doll meant for @entity4 girls as the basis for a birthday card that depicts a headscarf - wearing little girl as a terrorist			1
in a pink hijab , or headscarf , and flowered dress , a doll is depicted on the card saying things like ‘ pull string for message if you dare ! ’ and ‘ she ’ll love you to death ! ’ insinuating that the innocent - looking @entity4 is a suicide bomber			1
joke ? a greeting card company published this parody card ( pictured ) of a talking @entity4 doll that suggests the girl in a headscarf is a terrorist the card appears to be based on a real doll meant for actual @entity4 girls			1
the @entity30 , which speaks phrases in @entity32 , is the brainchild of a mother who could n’t find dolls that resembled her daughter			2
‘ it all started when my daughter was 2 ½ years old , ’ writes founder @entity37 on her company website			0
‘ i was trying to find toys that would help her to speak her mother tongue , @entity44			0
failing to find anything , i embarked upon designing a talking @entity44 doll myself			2
’ the doll , which has a male counterpart in the @entity50 doll , was the first of many products created by @entity53 to celebrate @entity4 and @entity55 culture with toys			1
@entity57 wears a pink hijab and a dress with flowers , just like the girl on the card			0
that message has now been made into a joke by greeting card company @entity67 , a joke a @entity64 - area muslim rights group says plays upon hateful stereotypes			2
@entity72 : the card bears a remarkable resemblance to @entity57 , a talking doll meant for @entity4 girls , from company @entity77 appropriate ? a muslim rights group believes the card is unacceptable and ' criminalizes ' the culture of the children who play with @entity77 ( pictured ) the card was first released in 2011 , but was only recently noticed by the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) in a @entity64 novelty store			1
‘ islamophobic generalizations and negative stereotypes often hit those who are most visibly perceived as @entity4 , ’ wrote @entity81 ’s @entity83 , ‘ and women wearing the @entity88 are often the group hit the hardest			1
‘ @entity4 women around the world , certainly in the @entity92 , choose to wear the @entity88 as a free - willed expression of modesty and self - respect			1
for them , it is a message that men should address their minds and not their bodies			0
’ @entity67 , whose motto is ‘ @entity102 ’ features an extensive line of politically - themed humor cards on its website			0
messages : inside , the card reads ' hope your birthday is a blow out ! ' and it appears to have been taken from maker @entity67 ' website kids toy : the @entity114 company also makes a boy doll , called @entity50 a brief survey found a card on which president @entity118 uses the word ‘ cracker ’ as a derogatory term for whites , a card showing a quizzical president @entity124 at a dam construction site asking ‘ are the @entity126 ? , and one featuring two @entity128 and the slogan ‘ homeland security : fighting terrorism since 1492 , ’ among many others			2
also on the @entity67 website is a personal message from company owner @entity135			0
‘ i can only imagine folks and friends , ’ writes @entity135 , ‘ who receive or read our cards , can help but wonder as to whether laughing is the appropriate thing to do			0
but as our motto goes : " @entity143 ' em if they ca n't take a joke ! " ’ @entity81 responded in kind : ‘ the notion that a doll , that looks like any other doll that any little girl in the world would play with , can be presented as a terrorist doll simply and only because it is a “ @entity4 ” doll or because it has a “ @entity4 scarf ” on its head is not what defines “ funny ” for a lot of people , but bigoted , ugly , idiotic , moronic , etc. ’ the @entity4 group said it has written an official letter to @entity67 sharing its concern over the card they say exposes little girls ‘ to messaging that criminalizes their basic identity for profit			1
’ the card appears to have been removed from the @entity67 website			0
tool : the dolls were created as a toy that also teaches languages like @entity44 and @entity32			0
