click here to find out more from our brilliant @entity2 service - including this heat map from @entity5 unless he takes drastic action it might prove rather difficult for @entity9 to stop his players relying too much on @entity11			1
dropping him is probably the only solution , such is the impact @entity16 ’s magical captain is beginning to have at this @entity17			1
after scoring the winning goal in his side ’s first two @entity20 encounters , @entity11 was at it again here at a pulsating @entity24			1
only this time he struck twice before @entity25 stepped forward to settle another utterly absorbing encounter and become only the second @entity16 player to score at these finals			1
if anything , @entity9 needs to focus his attention more at the opposite end of the field			0
he might concern himself with the fact that @entity34 limped off the pitch in the first half with what looked like another muscle injury ; a worry for @entity40 too given the problems their striker has endured this past year			0

man of the match : @entity11 manager : @entity111 7 bookings : @entity89 , @entity88 goals : @entity96 ' , 47 ' referee : @entity115 * @entity117 ratings by @entity118 at @entity119 but @entity9 should start to recognise the contribution of @entity5 in his side ’s attacking play and demand that his defenders start to perform to the same high standard			2
as dramatic a game as this was , it exposed the defensive frailties we witnessed in @entity16 ’s first two games			2
the back four creaked against @entity131 and owed much to the goalkeeping heroics of @entity61 to stop @entity133 from scoring			0
in @entity11 , of course , we have a player capable of doing for @entity16 what @entity136 once did in @entity138 28 years ago			1
a player seemingly ready to display that remarkable ability on the grandest stage of all			0
he might have been a little slow to get going in this tournament but he is gathering momentum now and very much leading his team from the front			0
as well as being his fourth of the tournament thus far , @entity11 ’s second was his tenth in eight international appearances and his 42nd in 89 in total ; a better return and a better ratio than @entity136 and second only to @entity154 on @entity16 ’s all - time list			1
@entity11 might have scored more on wednesday but @entity85 took the sensible decision to take him off after 63 minutes			2
jubilant : @entity11 ( left ) , @entity67 ( centre ) and @entity25 celebrate the opening goal double : @entity161 ( left ) grabbed his first @entity17 brace to give @entity48 hope but if a side that moves into the last 16 as group winners , with nine points , is to make it all the way to @entity168 on july 13 , @entity9 needs to apply some discipline to a back four that has a tendency to go missing a bit			1
inspired , no doubt , by a crowd dominated by the blue and white stripes of @entity16 – apparently some 200,000 supporters have made the 500 mile journey from their border to the west of @entity119 – @entity11 struck after just three minutes			1
racing onto a super pass from @entity65 , @entity67 unleashed a shot that hit the post and rebounded back against it after striking @entity53 on the back and then bounced into the path of the advancing @entity11 , who with his left foot simple drove the ball into the roof of the net			2
timing : the bomb was an hour before @entity48 's football team ( pictured ) played in the @entity17 , losing 3 - 2 lucky : @entity25 ( centre ) managed to knee the ball home to put @entity16 back into the lead in the lead : @entity25 ( left ) beats his chest after scoring for @entity16 in the @entity20 match @entity48 forward @entity161 scored twice to give his side hope against @entity16 - click here to find out more from our brilliant @entity2 service strike : @entity161 scored in the fourth minute to pull @entity48 back into the game but within 60 seconds @entity48 had levelled to make this the first match in @entity17 history to see both teams score inside the first five minutes			1
while it was a goal that was stunning in its execution , it also owed much to @entity16 ’s failure to close down their opponents			2
@entity94 – who sadly would leave the field in the second half with what looked like a fractured arm after being struck be a fast - moving ball – surged forward unopposed before feeding a pass into @entity161 , who in turn would be allowed to take a couple of steps inside before curling a stunning shot beyond the reach of a diving @entity61			2
other chances would then follow for @entity16 , with @entity67 particularly impressive alongside the genius that is @entity11			1
and after 37 minutes @entity34 would drop to the ground with nobody near him , suggesting that he had indeed pulled something			0
finish : @entity62 ( centre ) is unable to stop @entity96 's fourth minute strike well done : the @entity234 players join @entity161 in celebration after his first goal level : the @entity48 forward celebrates scoring his first goal of the game against @entity16 @entity16 would continue to apply pressure , with the athletic @entity53 doing well to stop a @entity11 free - kick			1
but no sooner than his team - mates applauded him for that save than another @entity11 delivery would prove beyond him			2
a breathtaking dead - ball delivery			0
it amounted to a crushing blow to @entity48 , coming just moments before the break			0
but they responded brilliantly , @entity96 levelling just two minutes into the second half after accelerating onto a perfectly weighted , defence - splitting pass from @entity97			0
again , however , @entity16 ’s defenders , in particular @entity63 and @entity25 , should have been more alert to the danger			0
pain : @entity94 was carried off on a stretched with an arm injury in the second half out : @entity94 arm was heavily strapped as he was carried off the pitch sealed : @entity87 gives @entity96 ( right ) a kiss on the forehead as his first goal of the game my ball : @entity64 ( left ) @entity25 ( right ) challenge @entity48 's forward @entity90 so far , though , @entity16 always seem to have an answer , their winner coming from a @entity71 corner three minutes later			1
@entity64 got the flick on , with @entity25 scoring off his thigh from close range			0
@entity96 , excellent here on wednesday , would almost hit back for @entity48 , @entity62 denying him his hat - trick with a goalline block			0
but in the end it did not prove too costly , @entity131 ’s defeat of @entity133 meaning both these teams go through			0
all arms and legs : @entity53 does his best to stop a @entity69 strike surrounded : the @entity48 players attempt to get a bit closer to the @entity287 star battle : @entity92 ( left ) challenges @entity5 during the first half of the @entity20 clash			1

@entity11 scores twice to help @entity16 defeat @entity48
@entity161 also bags a brace during pulsating @entity20 clash
both @entity16 and @entity48 have *qualified* for the last 16
