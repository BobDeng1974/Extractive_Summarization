doctors have urged medicine manufacturers to make sweet - tasting @entity2 less appealing to children with 12 million bottles sold each year , @entity2 is a medicine cabinet staple in most homes , soothing childhood aches and pains thanks to its main ingredient – paracetamol			1
but now a leading doctor has warned that children could be at risk of accidental overdose from @entity2 and other brightly coloured drugs that ‘ look more like milkshake than medicines ’			1
doctors say that @entity2 ’s syrup - sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘ almost irresistible ’ to some youngsters			1
‘ some children go to alarming lengths to get their hands on it while their parents ’ backs are turned , ’ said one			2
health professionals have now urged @entity2 ’s manufacturers to make the medicine less appealing to youngsters to prevent accidental overdose of paracetamol , which can cause serious liver damage and , in rare cases , prove fatal			1
the plea comes as figures obtained by @entity41 reveal nearly five children a day were admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the - counter painkillers in one year alone			1
concerns have previously been raised that children are given too much paracetamol by gps and parents who do not realise there are doses in other branded products , such as @entity54			2
the @entity56 statistics show that a staggering 1,691 children aged one to four were admitted to hospital in 2012 - 13 because of ‘ accidental poisoning ’ by medicines including non-prescription painkillers ibuprofen , paracetamol and aspirin			1
although perfectly safe within the recommended doses , paracetamol is one of the easiest drugs on which to overdose			2
unlike with other drugs , patients do not need much more than the advised amount before it starts to cause problems			0
a 2007 study found 84 per cent of babies are given @entity2 in their first six months			2
the brand ’s @entity76 , suitable for babies aged two months and over , is pink and strawberry - flavoured , while the @entity80 formula is orange - flavoured and coloured			0
doctors say that @entity2 ’s syrup - sweet strawberry taste and pink colouring also makes it ‘ almost irresistible ’ to some children , but it can be dangerous doctor and author dr @entity87 warns that children could be getting ‘ mixed messages ’ on the potential dangers that lurk inside the bottles			1
‘ the introduction of child - proof tops and blister packs for pills mean it is harder for children to get hold of medicines these days , but these figures revealing the number of children admitted to hospital show that , sadly , some still do , ’ he says			1
‘ with a medicine like @entity2 , the bright packaging and appealing taste means a young child could mistake it for sweets			1
the purple packaging for the @entity76 reminds you of @entity116 ’s chocolate , and the medicine itself looks more like milkshake			0
‘ how can we expect a child to understand that something that looks and tastes so nice actually has the potential to do harm if they have too much ? ’ calpol is used to treat common childhood conditions including fever , earache and teething trouble			0
official guidelines state babies aged between three and six months should be given no more than 240mg of paracetamol a day			0
that ’s the equivalent of just two 5ml teaspoons of @entity137 formula			0
infants aged six to 24 months can be given 5ml up to four times a day			0
dr @entity87 has urged @entity141 and @entity141 , @entity2 ’s manufacturers , to rethink the formula – and its packaging			0
nearly five children a day are admitted to hospital with accidental overdoses of over-the - counter painkillers , such as paracetamol ‘ @entity151 is an everyday painkiller but it has potential to cause serious harm , particularly to a child as their organs are less developed and more fragile , ’ he says			1
dr @entity157 , an @entity158 consultant at @entity159 , says worried parents with children who have drunk over-the - counter medicines are a familiar sight in emergency departments			1
she adds : ‘ sometimes the child has climbed up to get it from the medicine cabinet , or the parents may not have put it properly out of reach or failed to make sure the top is on securely			2
older siblings may give it to their little brother or sister			0
‘ children may reach for @entity2 as they recall having it before , and that it tastes nice			1
’ online parenting forum @entity176 contains posts from concerned parents whose children have obtained the medicine			2
one wrote : ‘ i ’ve just found a bottle of @entity185 open			0
they [ the children ] climbed up into the cupboard and managed to open the so - called child - proof lid			0
half a bottle has gone			0
’ public health nutritionist dr @entity191 says she can not understand why sweeteners such as sucrose are used to make @entity2 more palatable when a spoonful of milk would help the medicine go down just as well			1
‘ the bright pink colour of @entity2 could be related to overdose in children who are picking it up and think it ’s something like @entity201 , ’ she warns			1
‘ @entity203 medicine would be fine , and would reduce this risk			0
there is no rationale for using colours or artificial sweeteners			0
’ a @entity141 spokesman said : ‘ we are committed to patient safety and have numerous safeguards in place to prevent any accidental childhood poisoning			0
‘ the caps on bottles of @entity2 are thoroughly tested to resist a child ’s attempts to access the product			2
‘ the pink colour in @entity137 is long - standing and helps compliance for children by making the medicine they need more acceptable for them			1
