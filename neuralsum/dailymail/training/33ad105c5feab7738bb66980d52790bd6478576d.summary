by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:04 am on 20th december 2011 a charity earns less than £ 4.50 a year from each of its shoe recycling bins despite attracting thousands of tons of donations from the public			0
the @entity8 – famous for its @entity10 coaches – has a network of 7,000 branded collection points in supermarket car parks , offices and local authority tips across the country			1
their familiar love heart logo encourages the public to believe their donation goes towards helping sick , disabled and disadvantaged children			0
the law says the shoe banks should have a breakdown of where the money goes but the @entity28 , which operates the bins , is understood to have donated only £ 30,000 to the charity in the past 12 months			1
that is an improvement on 2009 when it gave only £ 5,500 to the @entity8 while published accounts suggested the firm made profits of more than £ 350,000			1
the network of collection points is believed to generate an average of £ 1.9million annually in shoe sales for @entity28 , which is part of the @entity42 recycling conglomerate @entity41			1
@entity43 , chief executive of watchdog the @entity45 , said : ‘ this is a commercial contract between the @entity8 and the @entity28			1
it is down to the charity to negotiate the best possible contract			0
‘ but on the face of it this does not appear to be a good deal			0
’ the watchdog is investigating whether the @entity8 branded recycling bins break the law by not detailing how the proceeds of public donations are split			1
an @entity28 spokesman said the company had a ‘ very , very small margin ’ on the shoes , meaning that it ‘ can not afford to pay more ’ to the @entity8			1
@entity28 believes the figure for donations to the charity will rise to £ 35,000 for this calendar year			1
the @entity8 has defended the use of it logo on the @entity28 recycling bins , claiming the money raised has helped ‘ thousands of sick , disabled or disadvantaged kids ’			1
@entity72 's @entity28 processes the show bank donations ' the ratio is ridiculous , ' said @entity75 , 56 , who was giving a pair of shoes to a @entity79 bank at @entity80 in @entity81 , north @entity82			2
' obviously they have expenses , but i thought that at least 60 per cent of the proceeds would go to poor people			0
' @entity28 is controlled by @entity72 , whose @entity42 and @entity89 - based businesses makes millions a year in profits from textile recycling under the @entity41 brand			1
his registered headquarters are in the @entity89 tax haven of @entity97			0
mr @entity98 from @entity28 said : ' whatever we pay to the charity , we have a very , very small margin and we can not afford to pay more			2
' it is very hard to pay full freight , pair the shoes , sort them and to make money			0
yes , we make money , but two to three years ago it was much better because productivity per box has gone way down			0
' the question is , do we pay the charity right ? i do n’t know how much they pay , if there is more then we have to improve to pay more , but i can tell you the profitability on recycling is 10 per cent to 15 per cent gross margin			0
' @entity28 said that in 2010 it donated more than £ 19,000 from the @entity8 shoe collection			1
turnover that year was just over £ 2m , according to figures seen by the @entity121 which @entity28 would not confirm or deny			1
mr @entity98 's @entity42 company , @entity41 , which recycles clothes for the @entity42 @entity124 , made close to £ 7m in underlying profits on sales of more than £ 60m in 2009 , according to accounts filed in @entity42			2
@entity98 is listed on the accounts as the sole director of @entity28 , but described himself as a ' passive shareholder '			2
he said @entity132 's chief executive , @entity131 , has responsibility for its management			0
' people see the @entity8 and they say " every shoe i put in here , its value will go through to the @entity8 " , ' mr @entity131 said			2
' well , no , because you have operational profits , the same as the @entity141 has , the same as @entity142 has			0
' we are growing and we will continue to give bigger donations to the @entity8			2
we are increasing our collections through development			0
' we run a commercial business and it is important the business is sustainable and continues to grow and continues our growth to the @entity8			2
' we are not misleading , we have never misled , we have always been extremely open with the @entity8			0
