make - up artist @entity1 @entity0 loves @entity2 so much he 's shelled out Â£ 100,000 on procedures to look like her			1
he copies her beauty regime , her make - up and even has clothes made that are inspired by her outfits			1
now the @entity10 superfan , 23 , is taking his transformation even further - he 's having implants to get a bottom as large as the reality star 's			1
appearing on this morning on @entity34 today , he said : ' i love @entity2 , i love her so much			2
i 've always admired strong women			1
' i was brought up by my mum and my nan so i 've always admired strong women			1
' @entity1 , who began his @entity2 transformation four years ago said he 's similarly infatuated with @entity40 and @entity1 but @entity2 is his top idol			1
along with the injectables , he 's had his eyebrows tattooed , micro-dermabrasion and regular ' vampire ' treatments , in which is blood is extracted from his arm and injected in his face to help rejuvenate his skin - a facial @entity2 underwent on her show			1
he said : ' as soon as i saw @entity2 get it done on @entity54 i was just like , oh my @entity55 , i need to try that , i need to get it done			2
' the @entity10 make - up artist has had fillers injected into his jawline to give him more definition along with tattooed eyebrows and lip fillers , he has regular micro-dermabrasion and ' vampire ' facials but @entity1 's body transformation is far from complete			1
he 's about to boost his bottom to the same size as the curvaceous beauty			1
' i love her bum , her bum 's amazing			0
when she did the cover when the bum was out , i think she looked amazing , she 's an inspiration			2
' i 'd like to go as big as her			0
i 'm not going to get implants , i wo n't go down the route of implants			0
' i 've been looking at body contouring , it 's quite big in @entity83			0
' i want to get liposuction on my stomach and back			2
i lost 70lb last year , i 'm so lazy , i never exercise so i want to get lipo on my stomach and back and they put the fat back into your bum so you get two procedures in one and you get a big bum			2
' @entity1 has regular ' vampire ' facials in which platelets from his blood are injected into his face to boost skin @entity1 was inspired to have the gory - looking treatment after seeing @entity2 have the facial on tv in 2013 but there are downsides to looking like @entity2 , including having such swollen lips that they 've lost feeling			1
but he 's also hurt by nasty comments from internet trolls criticising his behaviour			0
he said : ' i 've always worked , i 've worked since i was 13			0
i 'm a make - up artist and i work in a health club as well			1
' i 've had boyfriends in the past who 've funded my lifestyle and they 've paid for things			0
i 've come from a hard - working family			0
@entity1 , whose top lip can sometimes feel numb , has also had @entity40 's name tattooed on his arm ' @entity2 's lips are big , they 're obviously not as big as mine , ' he added , before explaining that he uses eye - drops every day to mimic her bright eyes			1

@entity1 has tattooed both arms , as well as his eyebrows and wo n't rest until he has @entity2 's big bottom ' i saw hate online , but i 've never taken any money off the @entity147 , i 've never been on benefits			1
i do loads for charity - they do n't know what i donate for charity			0
' and to critics who think his obsession with changing his appearance can only stem from low self - esteem he said : ' i 'm extremely confident			0
i love the way i look			0
' people do n't understand how you can look different and be confident			0
' but what would @entity2 think about his efforts ? ' i think she 'd be like , " good for him whatever he wants to do "			2
he spends two hours every day copying @entity2 's sculpting and shadowing contouring make - up techniques @entity1 says @entity169 's influence means that @entity2 's outfits , which he copies , are always ' amazing ' @entity1 aims to have fat from his back and stomach injected into his bottom to achieve @entity2 's outsized curves			1
