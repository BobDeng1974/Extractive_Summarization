by @entity0 hoping for twins ? eating a yam wo n't make any difference it is not just children who may be confused about where babies come from			0
a survey has revealed @entity10 couples also hold on to a number of old wives ' tales when it comes to getting pregnant			1
popular myths include drinking grapefruit juice or cough syrup and planting a rosemary bush			1
even in this day and age some women trying for a baby say they think they have a better chance of conceiving if they avoid mints and will have twins if they eat yams			1
others fear that eating strawberries or seeing mice during pregnancy could give their babies birthmarks			0
another superstition is that a woman who gives gifts of silver will get pregnant , said family planning experts @entity35 as they launched specially created @entity37			1
while much of the advice dates back centuries , some are more modern and scientific - such as advising men to wear boxer shorts to keep sperm at a more ideal temperature			2
surprisingly , the survey found half of all couples do not know many of the basic facts about the best ways to conceive , such as when a woman is at her most fertile for instance			1
and because they get it wrong many couples then start to believe their lack of success is down to a medical problem , said the @entity35 , who surveyed 1,000 couples			1

avoid mint the health charity has launched new fertility guidance packs via its website in order to try and shatter some of the myths around pregnancy			0
the packs include basic information and guidance plus products like folic acid supplements - more useful to women trying for a baby than a rosemary bush or grapefruit juice			1
@entity97 , @entity35 director of information said : ' many people trying to conceive have never been taught the basic facts about their own reproductive cycle			1
' as a result couples may mistakenly believe themselves to be infertile , causing them to seek expensive fertility treatments and suffer a great deal of stress , when there is really no need			0
' equally , couples with a genuine problem may be waiting for nature to take its course , when in fact there is a fertility issue and they need professional help without delay			0
