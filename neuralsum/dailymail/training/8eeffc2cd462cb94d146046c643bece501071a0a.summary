the anger comes as a result of concerns that regulations on pre-booking services such as @entity17 , @entity155 and @entity32 are not tight enough and risk damaging the business of traditional hail - and - ride drivers who pay a heavy fee to attain a licence to carry passengers			1
the @entity5 government has already come out on the side of traditional taxi drivers , imposing a minimum 15 - minute wait between booking and pick - up on all pre-book services since the beginning of the year			2
