by @entity0 published : 09:59 est , 26 april 2012 updated : 10:18 est , 26 april 2012 it 's perhaps the most daring naval mission ever undertaken by mankind - sailing on the methane seas of @entity4 's @entity3			1
a new @entity6 mission , with @entity8 scientists on board , aims to explore these oceans - by parachuting a vessel into the seas of @entity3 , just less than a billion miles from @entity13			1
' it 's a boat , essentially			1
you 'd have been locked up if you 'd suggested that before , ' says professor @entity16 of the @entity17			0
' it 's a boat , essentially , ' says professor @entity19 of the @entity8 's @entity17 lakes filled with liquid methane on @entity4 's @entity22 , based on the images above from @entity6 's @entity25 spacecraft artist 's conception of the dunes on @entity4 's moon : the dunes are up to 300 feet high and a mile wide , and made of frozen hydrocarbons - the chemicals found in crude oil - not sand the ' boat ' proposal will be discussed at a conference in @entity38 this week the proposal is to be discussed at a space conference in @entity38 this week			1
previously , scientists have proposed heavier - than - air gliders to explore the icy moon - or other vehicles that could penetrate the thick clouds that shroud the planet			0
@entity6 's @entity25 probe discovered lakes of methane on the planet in 2008			2
the ' lakes ' of @entity3 contain more hydrocarbons - the fuels we use cars and other energy supplies - than the whole supplies of @entity13			1
the moon is thickly shrouded in clouds , and scientists are intrigued about what lies beneath			0
@entity3 is bigger than our own @entity61 and even the planet @entity62			2
the temperature at @entity3 's surface is about -178 178 degrees centigrade			1
the planet also has sand dunes , just like ours			0
@entity6 's @entity25 probe has found that the dunes on the surface of @entity4 's @entity22 vary in shape just like dunes on @entity13 - and even look similar to deserts on our planet			1
the similarities end there , of course - not only are the dunes on @entity3 300 feet high and up to a mile wide , they 're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand			2
there are four million square miles of dunes on @entity3 , an area the size of the @entity86			2
their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon 's mysterious weather patterns			0
the huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of @entity4 's @entity22 were captured by @entity6 's @entity25 - and the geographical variations on @entity3 are similar to variations on @entity13 various proposals for the further exploration of @entity3 have been proposed - including heavier - than - air gliders that would float above the planet analysis of images sent back by @entity6 's orbiting @entity25 probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on @entity13			1
the result gives new clues about the moon ’s climatic and geological history			0
dune fields are the second most dominant landform on @entity3 , after the seemingly uniform plains , so they offer a large - scale insight into the moon ’s peculiar environment			0
backing this hypothesis is the fact that @entity3 ’s lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude			2
these reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere , suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so , again , the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind			0
' understanding how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape , size and distribution on @entity3 ’s surface is of great importance to understanding @entity3 ’s climate and geology , ' says @entity137 , @entity138 ’s @entity25 project scientist .			0

proposal to ' *splash* down ' in methane seas of @entity3
to be discussed at @entity38 space conference
' it 's a boat , essentially ' , says *researcher*
more methane and other *precious* hydrocarbons than on whole of @entity13
