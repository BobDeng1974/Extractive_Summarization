the estranged wife of former @entity2 owner @entity1 turned her romantic rival 's words against her in court friday , playing a recording that showed her husband showered @entity8 with millions of dollars in gifts			1
in closing arguments in the trial seeking the return of more than $ 2.8million in community property the @entity16 acquired over six decades of marriage , @entity11 's lawyer relied on the words of miss @entity19 to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy			1
‘ the truth is that everything that i have , you 've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you , ’ @entity19 said in snippet			2
‘ that 's it , that 's over			0
end of case , ’ attorney @entity26 said			0
testimony in @entity31 was n't as clear - cut even after @entity1 's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks @entity1 drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of @entity19 's $ 1.8million @entity38 - style duplex near @entity39			1
judge @entity72 , who did n't indicate how soon he would rule , had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the @entity1 family 's real estate company to @entity19 's bank accounts			1
defense lawyer @entity79 reiterated that point in his closing argument			0
he attacked the credibility of witnesses , particularly @entity1 , who had suggested @entity19 got her name on the home title illegally because she was part hispanic and had buddied up to a @entity88 banker and escrow officer			2
it was @entity19 who recorded the now - infamous conversation with @entity1 in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to @entity2 basketball games			2
in the furor sparked when the remarks were made public , the @entity96 banned @entity1 from the league for life , and he was ultimately forced to sell the @entity2 franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $ 2billion			2
@entity79 spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law does n't allow @entity11 to go after a third party like @entity19 because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband			1
key witness : @entity19 was called to testify in the non-jury trial of a lawsuit brought by @entity1 's wife , which seeks the return of $ 3.6million ‘ say he gave $ 2,000 to a call girl , ’ @entity79 said			1
‘ mrs. @entity11 ca n't go and try to get that money back			2
we know that 's not how it works			0
’ in her testimony earlier friday , @entity19 painted two conflicting portraits of @entity1 , saying from the witness stand that he was a kind , generous mentor and father figure to her but was a bigot who was mean to others			1
she also testified that the 80 - year - old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant , driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children			0
‘ we were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual			2
he became my everything and i became his all , ’ she said , though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature			0
@entity11 , who accused @entity19 of fraud when she testified wednesday , has painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him			1
wife speaks : @entity11 , estranged wife of former @entity2 basketball team owner @entity1 , and her attorney @entity26 arrive at @entity31 friday			1
mrs @entity11 painted @entity19 as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts @entity19 , seen here outside the court thursday , testified that tolerating @entity16 's racist moments was ' part of the job ' @entity19 has not disputed @entity1 's largesse , though she has quibbled with the sums at stake and has emphatically denied she used sex to manipulate him			1
she repeatedly testified that @entity1 tried to manipulate her			2
the apparent contradictions finally led @entity11 's lawyer , @entity26 , to confront @entity19 with the question : ‘ who is the real @entity1 ? ’ ‘ the real @entity1 is a con artist , a bigot ... he 's mean , he 's despicable , ’ @entity19 replied , before quickly adding that to her , he was ‘ kind , loving , sweet ... a mentor , a father			1
... he treated me as he treated no one else			0
’ she added that tolerating his racist moments was ' part of the job ' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family			0
@entity19 broke down in tears as she described the @entity2 owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys			0
platonic relationship : the 32 - year - old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the @entity2 owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature she said , he said : @entity19 rejected the idea that she used sexual favors to manipulate the married billionaire and insisted that he was the one who tried to manipulate her in her testimony friday , miss @entity19 claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor , and she named a male friend of @entity1 's who accompanied them on trips to @entity205 , @entity63 and @entity206			1
@entity11 said outside court that the assertion was crazy , and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises @entity19			1
the judge allowed the testimony as @entity19 's lawyer tried to show where large , unexplained checks may have gone from @entity1 's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $ 1.8million duplex , luxury cars , jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman @entity11 asserts was his mistress			1
@entity19 said she saw cashier 's checks given to the man for $ 800,000 for a ' so - called business deal ' involving a property in @entity43 and a check for $ 75,000 to reimburse him for the @entity205 travel			2
@entity19 could n't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase			0
she has denied that those were her bank accounts , and @entity1 's lawyers could n't make that connection			1
the 32 - year - old witness said she had worked for @entity1 's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years , driving him to view real estate or attending @entity2 meetings and games together			1
she said he provided money , but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job			0
' as long as you 're with me side by side , i will take care of everything you need , ' she said he assured her			0
but @entity19 became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement			0
she said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork			0
' i know how he works his trickery , ' she said			0
' i knew something was n't right			0

@entity8 , 32 , said that to her @entity1 was a mentor and a father , but to others he was ' a con artist , a bigot ' ... mean and ' despicable '
' we were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual . he became my everything and i became his all , ' she testified
@entity1 's estranged wife , @entity53 , painted @entity19 as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts
mrs @entity11 filed lawsuit seeking return of $ 3.6million in community marital assets
@entity19 claimed @entity1 also lavished a male friend of his with gifts
