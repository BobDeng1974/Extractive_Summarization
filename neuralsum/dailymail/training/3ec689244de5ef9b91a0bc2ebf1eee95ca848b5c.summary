farce : 37stone @entity1 had to reason with staff who allocated his two seats rows apart before he boarded the plane , 37stone @entity1 had already been forced to pay for an extra ticket			1
the airline ’s rules for passengers weighing more than 20stone required him to buy two seats for himself			1
but when he got on board , insult was added to injury			2
for a dismayed mr @entity1 found his seats for the flight to @entity16 were not even next to each other – they were either side of another traveller ’s seat			1
and on his return journey the situation was even more farcical , with his allocated places two rows apart			1
mr @entity1 , 43 , had booked his tickets in advance of the flight			1
but he said the unnamed airline ’s employees did not seem to understand its policy on heavier passengers			2
‘ when i got to the airport i had to explain to all the staff why i had two tickets , ’ he said yesterday			1
‘ they did n’t have a clue			2
when i finally got on the plane one was an aisle seat and the other was by the window – in a three - seat row			1
' on the way back from @entity16 one seat was in row 17 and the other in row 19			1
’ mr @entity1 , of @entity44 near @entity45 , @entity46 , said the incident was one of many everyday difficulties he has faced since he began struggling with his weight			1

’ mr @entity1 , 43 , pictured at his home in @entity74 , south @entity46 , was coming home from @entity16 he was forced to book two seats on the flight as the airline does not cater for obesity but charges extra instead when his wife @entity80 died from cancer in 2009 he admits he turned to comfort eating			1
‘ i fell into a depression , ’ he said			0
‘ i could n’t be bothered to cook , would eat takeaways and want to treat my step - daughter @entity86 because her mother had died			0
‘ when i was working , i had to get the calories in			0
i ’d be up at 5am and have a cooked breakfast later			0
i also worked for a bakery , which involved physically hard lifting , moving things around			0
’ earlier this year a travel expert advocated a ‘ pay - what - you - weigh ’ airline pricing scheme because heavier people cost more in fuel to fly			2
passengers weighing above a certain threshold would pay more for their plane tickets and lighter ones would be charged less under plans put forward by @entity105 scientist dr @entity104			1
