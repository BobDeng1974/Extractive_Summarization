by @entity0 the best is yet to come from @entity2			2
that was the promise , at least , from coach @entity4 ahead of friday 's @entity6 quarter - final against @entity7 at the @entity8			1
while @entity2 looked impressive in a 4 - 0 win over @entity11 in its opening match , the three - time champions struggled in their next games , being held to a 2 - 2 draw by @entity15 , edging the @entity16 1 - 0 and needing extra time to beat @entity18 2 - 1			1
still , @entity2 are contesting their ninth straight @entity6 quarter - final			1
final preparations : @entity21 , @entity4 and @entity22 of @entity2 look on during a training session tough test : @entity4 was speaking ahead of @entity2 's quarter - final clash with @entity7 on friday ' we have not yet delivered our best possible performance , ' @entity4 said on thursday			1
' but i do n't think anyone has reached their absolute top performance yet			0
' it 's not a computer game that is easily figured out - you ca n't easily figure out your opponent and it 's not easy to program your own team			2
... and then there are other elements from beyond the pitch			0
' an element such as this : seven @entity2 players have been struggling with illness			2
' one - third of our squad has been complaining about a sore throat , ' @entity47 said			0
' but wednesday and thursday all players have been training and none were feeling exhaustion			0
i just hope that stays stable until friday			0
' @entity2 played its group matches in the warmer , northeastern climates of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 then faced @entity18 in the second round in cool and damp conditions in the southern city of @entity65			1
seal skills : @entity68 defender @entity67 balances a ball on his head during training care free : @entity72 and @entity73 seemed to be enjoying themselves at the @entity8 @entity75 : @entity2 highlights ' perhaps they got contaminated from others , or maybe it was the difference in temperatures , or the air conditioning , ' @entity4 said			1
center back @entity81 missed the @entity18 game due to illness but @entity47 indicated he 'll be back against @entity7			1
likewise , midfielder @entity84 is expected to return from severe cramps after being substituted against @entity18			2
the only @entity2 player ruled out is defender @entity87 , who will miss the rest of the tournament with a left hamstring injury			2
against @entity18 , @entity2 struggled when it lost possession and @entity18 put together swift counter-attacks			1
under control : seven @entity2 players have been struggling with illness throughout the week on the ball : @entity84 , @entity97 of @entity2 prepare for the quarter - final at @entity8 ' i think this kind of match is decided in midfield			1
if we can dominate there it will say a lot in terms of achieving a positive result , ' midfielder @entity22 said			0
' our style of play is to keep the ball on the ground and we have many players that are very good at that			0
we need to have more precise passes and have better concentration			0
that 's our match philosophy			0
' while @entity7 is aiming to exceed expectations , @entity2 had loftier goals from the start			2
' they want us to get the title , ' @entity22 said			0
' anything else will be ( considered ) a defeat			0
' impressive : @entity2 are contesting their ninth straight @entity6 quarter - final @entity128 are favourites - @entity129			1
