@entity0 believes @entity2 captain @entity1 should stick to playing in front of the back four rather than in a more advanced role			1
the @entity6 skipper has struggled to find his best form this campaign having missed out the @entity10 title last season			1
and @entity0 also expects @entity1 to see out his career at @entity2			1
@entity1 has struggled to capture his best form this season after missing out on the title in may @entity1 did manage to get on the scoresheet in @entity2 's win over @entity15 on tuesday writing in his @entity17 column , he said : ' for all the debate over where @entity1 plays out his days at @entity2 , i do not see his role as anything other than a holding midfielder			1
' playing in that no 10 playmaker role can be very difficult in your thirties			0
there is always a danger the game can pass you by , especially if the midfield behind you are not at the very top of their game			0
' it seems natural to me that @entity1 would stay at @entity2 for the rest of his career			2
the time to move , if ever , was a decade ago when he would have had a better chance of winning a league title elsewhere , most likely @entity39			2
' @entity2 have struggled both at home and abroad this season after their brilliant campaign last year @entity2 youngsters train ahead of @entity46 's visit to @entity6 on saturday manager @entity47 ( left ) has found himself under pressure this season @entity0 ' view differs from that of former @entity2 assistant @entity51 , however			1
he told @entity52 : ' @entity1 is a top player			0
' he is not in the same condition he was 10 years ago but he still has the quality to influence a game and the position he played against @entity15 , a little bit closer to the striker , is probably the position he enjoys the most and he 'll always score goals from that position			0
' he still has the legs to play in that position and i think that 's where he enjoys playing the most			0
' @entity2 were a different team last year with ( @entity68 ) @entity67 and ( @entity70 ) @entity69 up front and they could afford to drop @entity1 a little deeper , but they 've got a different team now and i think they 'll get more out of him by playing him a bit further forward			0
