@entity0 hardly broke sweat as they stayed firmly on course to reach the @entity4 quarter - finals by thumping @entity5 67 - 0 at @entity6			1
the @entity14 , with their juggernaut wing @entity8 in destructive form on his first appearance since being concussed during @entity12 ’ clash against @entity13 three weeks ago , had a bonus point wrapped up inside 35 minutes			1
and it proved to be their record @entity18 win , smashing a 68 - 21 success against another @entity22 side - @entity21 - during the 2006 - 07 season			0
@entity25 winger @entity24 crosses for the first of his three tries for @entity0 at @entity29 's @entity28 @entity30 winger @entity8 ( right ) was in destructive form for the @entity14 @entity33 forward @entity32 scored three tries after coming off the bench an early penalty try was followed by a short - range @entity38 touchdown before scintillating flowing moves led to scores for scrum - half @entity41 and wing @entity24 , with two @entity45 conversions leaving @entity46 whipping boys @entity5 24 points adrift at half - time			1
@entity38 , his leg strapped , went off early in the second period - his departure looked precautionary - but there was no let - up from @entity0 as further tries followed for @entity56 , @entity57 , two more by @entity24 and a 13 - minute hat - trick for substitute forward @entity32 , while @entity45 finished with four conversions and full - back @entity60 two			1
@entity62 champions @entity14 ’ 11 - try haul took them to 15 points in the group , and victories in their final two pool games next month away to the @entity69 and at home against @entity71 will guarantee a last - eight place			0
@entity0 fly half @entity45 makes a strong run through the @entity5 defence @entity0 strengthened their quest to retain control of @entity78 by recalling a number of their international stars , including @entity38 , plus the @entity83 forward trio of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
and after just 12 minutes an awesome display of @entity0 scrummaging power led to @entity90 referee @entity89 awarding a penalty try that @entity45 converted			0
@entity5 conceded seven penalties in the opening 15 minutes , and although @entity95 initially opted against awarding any yellow cards , the visitors found themselves under relentless pressure that resulted in a simple finish for @entity38			0
it was @entity38 ’s fifth try of the current @entity18 campaign , and came following impressive approach work by number eight @entity104 and @entity105 , before @entity14 rounded off a one - sided opening quarter by conjuring a stunning 80 - metre score			2
@entity83 star @entity86 ( right ) returned to @entity0 's starting line - up wing @entity24 , @entity60 and @entity56 were all heavily involved , and @entity105 provided a spectacular finish by turning @entity5 full - back @entity110 inside out to put @entity0 out of sight			2
and the bonus point try arrived six minutes before half - time after @entity38 ran powerfully from his own half , then without breaking stride he slipped a one - handed offload to flanker @entity118 , whose pass sent @entity24 sprinting over unopposed for a 24 - 0 lead			2
the try came with @entity5 temporarily down to 14 men after lock @entity123 was sin - binned , and @entity95 found his patience tested as the visitors began to infringe at regular intervals in the face of unremitting set - piece pressure			0
@entity14 backrower @entity104 is tackled by @entity5 's @entity129 ( left ) and @entity130 @entity56 crossed within four minutes of the restart from close range , then @entity60 ’s angled run created an opening for @entity24 ’s second score			2
@entity85 was denied a try when the television match official ruled the giant @entity14 lock had made a double movement			0
the closing stages belonged to @entity141 as the @entity142 international claimed two tries in four minutes after he replaced @entity118 , while @entity5 collected another yellow card when substitute prop @entity146 received his marching orders for a technical offence			0
@entity32 then effortlessly completed his hat - trick at the base of an advancing @entity0 scrum , and @entity24 also delivered a treble before @entity38 ’s replacement @entity57 added the final touchdown during a blistering finish .			1
