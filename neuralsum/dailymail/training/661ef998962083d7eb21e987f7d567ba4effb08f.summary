@entity5 , 35 , was arrested and questioned by detectives investigating the theft of precious artefacts from a museum on thursday , last week			1
but he was bailed on monday after the @entity20 apparently decided there was not enough evidence to bring a charge			2
police were unable to find him the next day when they decided to re-arrest him for further questioning			1
detective and prosecutors are now trying to pointing the finger at each other over who made the decision to free mr @entity5			1
a @entity3 spokesman said that they were under pressure because ' we are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold people without charge ' , adding : ' at the time we were both working exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging , fast moving conditions			1
' detective superintendent @entity41 told the mirror : ‘ he has been arrested , he has been interviewed , he has been bailed and now we wish to interview him again			2
' ‘ we will be making inquiries to tract him and re-arrest him			2
the evidence was felt by some not to be strong enough to charge , ’ he said , adding that the decision whether to charge was no longer down to police			2
however , the @entity20 said when it believed enough evidence has been secured it gave the green light to bring charges			0
but at some stage mr @entity5 was released			1
the @entity20 told the mirror : ‘ this was a fast moving matter with finely balanced decisions taken within strict legal custody time limits			1
’ mr @entity5 was one of five people from the @entity62 who were arrested and bailed pending further inquiries , following the night raid at @entity66 's @entity65			1
the raiders made straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a @entity70 porcelain figurine he is currently being hunted over the audacious heist in which a gang of thieves took just 120 seconds to steal artefacts worth £ 2million from a museum – after breaking in by cutting a hole in a brick wall			1
wanted : @entity3 also released a photo of @entity79 who is sought over the heist the ' highly organised ' criminals spent 40 minutes using specialist tools to force a 2ft by 3ft gap into the exterior of the building			2
but once they were inside , they needed only two minutes to snatch the valuable relics and flee			0
@entity3 named @entity5 , also known as @entity89 or @entity90 , 35 , and @entity79 , 32 , from @entity91 , @entity62 , as the two men they want to trace			1
both men will be aware they are wanted by police , det supt @entity41 , who is leading a 40 - strong team of detectives , said			1
after the thieves had broken through the brickwork , they headed straight for the @entity100 gallery , where they stole an 18th century jade bowl and a @entity70 porcelain figurine which were on display in separate cabinets			0
the bowl dates from 1769 and has a @entity107 poem written inside , while the figurine , of fairies in a boat , stands at about 12in			0
both are from the @entity112 , @entity107 's last imperial dynasty , which ended a century ago			2
detective superintendent @entity41 said : ' it seems very clear that this was a well - planned , highly organised break - in			0
' they have spent around 40 minutes creating a hole in an outside wall and when it has been big enough , they have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items			0
the figurine is of seven fairies in a boat and stands about 12in ( 30cm ) high			0
police believe the artefacts were stolen to order planned job : police said they were sure it was planned for quite some time and believe the artefacts were stolen to order , ' for someone who has already identified a potential market ' the gang spent 40 minutes making a hole in an outside wall at @entity66 's @entity65 before swiping two highly valuable artefacts ' i am sure this job has been planned for quite some time and i would think the artefacts have been stolen to order , for someone who has already identified a potential market			1
' there are fears the @entity107 artefacts may already have been spirited abroad to be sold			0
police have arrested five people in connection with the incident last thursday , all from the @entity62			0
officers also want to question @entity153 , 32 , and @entity154 , 35 , who are believed to have gone on the run			1
@entity5 , who is from @entity91 and also uses the names @entity157 or @entity90 , was interviewed at the weekend but his present location is unknown			2
@entity79 's last known address was also in @entity91			0
mr @entity41 said : ' they will both be aware of our interest and if anyone knows where they have gone , i would ask them to contact the police or ring @entity169			0
' three men aged 56 , 41 and 36 , and a 34 - year - old woman , were arrested at the weekend and released on bail			1
another man , aged 27 and from @entity91 , is under arrest and being interviewed at a police station in @entity177			0
a @entity3 spokesman said : ' @entity179 and the @entity20 have a very good working relationship			0
it ’s not correct to say , as some have , that a suspect was released in error			0
' at the time we were both working exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging , fast moving conditions			1
we are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold people without charge			0
' we will not be disclosing a detailed sequence of events ; it 's neither appropriate nor productive to focus on this one issue when we are concentrating our efforts on arresting those we believe to be responsible for an extremely serious crime and recovering priceless artefacts			0
' @entity66 's @entity65 : the raiders spent 40 minutes creating a hole in an outside wall before making a bee - line for two highly valuable artefacts			2

detectives questioned @entity5 after audacious heist then bailed him
but when officers went to re-arrest him the following day he had *vanished*
police blame ' challenging , fast moving conditions ' for the 35 - year - old 's release
