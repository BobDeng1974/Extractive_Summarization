the way @entity2 planned it , by this time he ’d have been managing against @entity5 teams every week			1
instead he leads @entity7 @entity6 into sunday ’s live tv fourth - round @entity10 tie against @entity11 rather glad to remind everybody he ’s still around , and still producing teams that can win games			1
it was nearly 13 years ago that @entity2 was the rising star of management			1
he ’d taken his home town club @entity19 from the @entity20 to what is now @entity7 , before moving to his first big club job at @entity23			1
@entity6 manager @entity2 is preparing for the visit of @entity11 in the @entity10 on sunday just five months and 13 games later he walked out and went to work with @entity26 at @entity27 — and it ’s been a topsy - turvy ride ever since			1
‘ i was impatient , i wanted to get to the top and i made bad decisions because of it , ’ said @entity2 , 50			2
‘ but nobody quite knows the real reasons i walked away from @entity23			0
i did n’t have @entity35 and @entity36 running the club , i had the @entity39 owners			2
‘ i left after five months , but i should have left @entity23 after five days			0
then more people would have asked why			0
’ a younger @entity2 on the touchline as @entity23 manager in september 2002 @entity2 celebrating leading @entity19 to victory in the @entity46 playoff final in 2002 the promise of following @entity26 into the top job at @entity27 was never kept , and he ended up in charge of @entity50 struggling in the championship			1
‘ we had nothing but i made about 16million quid through cup runs and selling players			0
then i could n’t get 300 grand one day and i spat my dummy and left			0
’ from there it was @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and then @entity6			2
so has he found the club to get back to the big time ? ‘ the chairman has put £ 50m into the team , and is putting in another £ 40m to rebuild the stadium			0
‘ @entity6 definitely could host a @entity5 club — about 550,000 people live here			2
i would n’t be in a hurry to walk out of this one			0

@entity2 would have been *hoping* to be @entity5 boss by now
leads @entity7 @entity6 in fourth round clash against @entity11
nearly 13 years since he was rising star of management at @entity19
he has managed six sides since leaving his *hometown* club in 2002
