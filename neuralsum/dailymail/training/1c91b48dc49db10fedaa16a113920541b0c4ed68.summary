by @entity0 published : 14:51 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 06:01 est , 24 january 2013 scientists have discovered the two - million - year - old fossil remains of a fox			2
the ancient ancestor of the modern - day animal was found in @entity6 at a site known as the @entity8 because of its significance in human fossil discoveries			1
in 2008 the @entity12 site yielded the discovery of @entity14 - thought to be an early human ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics			1
the mandible of 2million year old @entity19 - named after recently deceased mammalogist and ecologist prof @entity18 the ' @entity22 ' is one of eight @entity24 in @entity6			1
in 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the discovery of @entity14 - thought to be an early human ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics			1
the world - renowned @entity27 is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world			0
it is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as ' @entity35 ' , and an almost complete hominid skeleton called ' @entity37 ' , dated 2.3 and 4.17 million years old respectively			0
@entity14 was also dated at two - million - years - old so it looks like man and fox were just as well - known to each other as they are today			1
the discovery of the ancient mammal remains were made on tuesday by teams from the @entity6 universities of @entity46 and @entity47			1
the new fox fossils consist of a mandible and parts of the skeleton and can be distinguished from any living or extinct form of fox known to science based on proportions of its teeth and other aspects of its anatomy			0
the two - million - year - old fox - named @entity19 - after recently deceased mammalogist and ecologist prof @entity18			0
' the evolutionary history of foxes ( @entity66 ) is muchless well understood than that of the larger dogs of the @entity69 , ' the researchers wrote			0
dr. @entity70 from the @entity71 , head of the @entity12 carnivore studies , said : ' it 's exciting to see a new fossil fox			0
the team say the animal they found was relatively small			0
' @entity79 ( @entity80 sensu lato ) and wild dogs ( @entity82 ) are much larger than the specimen , ' they wrote			0

' professor @entity111 , director of the @entity12 project notes , also from @entity47 , said : ' @entity12 continues to reveal this extraordinary record of past life and as important as the human ancestors are from the site			2
' the site 's contribution to our understanding of the evolution of modern @entity6 mammals through wonderful specimens like this fox is of equal import			1
' who knows what we will find next ? ' the entire team has expressed their privilege in naming the new species after - @entity18 , one of the great names in the study of @entity6 mammals and particularly carnivores			2
further boners from the find , which as the earliest ancestor of the modern fox ever found			2
