defence secretary : @entity1 said @entity2 wanted @entity3 to become ' more involved ' in the fight @entity3 last night warned it was ‘ unrealistic ’ to expect it to launch a ground offensive against @entity7 without support from other @entity10 members			1
@entity2 and the @entity11 have been pressing @entity3 for weeks to play a major military role against the extremists who have now advanced to within less than a mile of its border with @entity16			1
defence secretary @entity1 yesterday said @entity2 wanted @entity3 to become ‘ more involved ’ in the fight against @entity18			1
but @entity3 foreign minister @entity19 has ruled out a unilateral offensive			1
speaking after talks in @entity22 with @entity10 secretary general @entity23 he warned that the @entity11 - led bombing missions against @entity18 forces in @entity16 would not be enough , but said that @entity3 would not get involved at this stage			1
‘ you need to take into consideration all options , including an operation on the ground , ’ he said			0
‘ you can not expect @entity3 to do a land operation			0
this is not a realistic approach			0
’ @entity3 has the second largest army in @entity10 but has chosen to stand by and watch the ferocious battle for the @entity16 border town of @entity38 , which is besieged by @entity18 fanatics			1
there has been growing frustration among members of the @entity11 - led coalition being assembled against @entity18 at the reluctance of @entity3 to intervene , despite having forces positioned on the border			1
one @entity2 defence source last night said @entity3 appeared to be waiting for an attack by @entity18 in order to invoke @entity10 ’s principle of collective self - defence , which could drag the entire military alliance into the war			1
@entity55 protesters throw stones at @entity3 soldiers on an armoured vehicle trying to disperse them during a protest demanding that the @entity3 government do more to help the @entity16 border town of @entity38 yesterday mr @entity1 yesterday confirmed that @entity2 and the @entity11 would be stepping up pressure on @entity3 to take the initiative against @entity18			1
‘ @entity3 certainly could help , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a matter for @entity3 , but other allies in the region have been helping			0
‘ from the south , some of the @entity68 countries and @entity69 were helping in @entity11 strikes and in the end , yes , this is a situation that can only be resolved not just by @entity11 and by @entity2 but by the region itself			2
‘ so we ’d certainly like to see @entity3 more involved , but in the end that ’s obviously a decision for their government			2
he went on : ‘ they ’re certainly very aware of the situation in @entity38 , the desperate situation there , and obviously we ’ll have to see whether they can help more ... not getting involved at this stage : speaking after talks in @entity22 with @entity10 secretary general @entity23 ( left ) , @entity3 foreign minister @entity19 ( right ) yesterday ruled out a unilateral offensive ‘ every country comes to this from its own position			1
they ’ve obviously had difficulties with @entity55 extremism in the past ; they ’ve had hostages very recently and so on			0
‘ but clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to deal with @entity18 [ @entity18 ]			0
otherwise we will have @entity102 falling apart and @entity16 falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region			0
’ mr @entity1 also confirmed that @entity2 is working with the @entity11 to set up military training camps for ‘ moderate ’ @entity16 fighters elsewhere in the @entity107			1
he said : ‘ we are looking , with the @entity11 , at training of the moderate @entity16 that we can identify , but outside @entity16			2
' providing training in camps elsewhere in the @entity107 , where we can train those in community self - defence in being able to resist @entity18 [ @entity18 ] , but doing that outside @entity16 and then putting them back into the fight in @entity16 , and we ’re trying to identify that effort at the moment			2
blast : smoke rises following an airstrike by @entity11 - led coalition aircraft in @entity38 , @entity16 , during fighting between @entity123 and militants of the @entity7 group yesterday ‘ there ’s the @entity127 , there are moderate elements in that , and there are other places in the @entity107 where they could be trained , in @entity133 for example , in @entity69 and elsewhere			1
that ’s something we ’re looking at very urgently now			0
’ mr @entity1 acknowledeged that @entity18 has to be defeated in both @entity102 and @entity16 , but said ministers do not believe that @entity138 is ready to authorise the extension of military action into @entity16			2
‘ we do n’t have authority from @entity138 to operate in @entity16 at the moment			0
our judgment at the moment is that @entity138 would n’t give us that authority , ’ he said			0
@entity147 , a labour member of the commons defence committee , said there was no case for further @entity2 intervention until @entity3 stepped up to take its share of responsibility			2
she said : ‘ let ’s talk about @entity3 ’s role – they wo n’t even let us fly our jets to help , so they have to fly from @entity159			0
there is no good that can come from @entity2 taking unilateral action			0

@entity1 says @entity2 would ' certainly like to see @entity3 more involved '
@entity3 foreign minister @entity19 rules out unilateral offensive
but says @entity11 - led bombing missions against @entity18 in @entity16 wo *n't* be enough
