by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 18 october 2013 a sex attack victim said yesterday that she has been betrayed by @entity3 justice after her attacker walked free from court citing his ‘ sexsomnia ’			1
the woman , a married teacher , said she was subjected to a violent assault by @entity9 , 41 , as she slept next to her husband at a friend ’s house			1
but the court accepted mr @entity9 ’s explanation that he was asleep at the time of the alleged assault , which happened after a birthday party			1
distraught : the mother - of - two - has complained to the @entity20 after her attacker walked free his wife also gave evidence in his defence , saying he would sometimes have sex with her while asleep			1
the victim has written to director of public prosecutions @entity26 to request a review of her case and other ‘ sexsomnia ’ cases			1
she claimed in court that mr @entity9 was awake during the assault and said later that the @entity34 failed to question his sleepwalking account properly			1
the @entity34 appeared to have breached its own guidelines that sleepwalking defences should be ‘ robustly challenged ’ , she added			2
a jury found mr @entity9 not guilty ‘ by reason of insanity ’ because he could not control his actions while asleep			1
he was allowed to walk free from court yesterday despite the judge admitting that he posed a ‘ serious risk ’ to others			1
free : @entity9 , 41 claimed he was asleep during the sexual assault and was found not guilty due to his ' sexsomnia ' the woman , a 42 - year - old mother - of - two , has branded the treatment of her case ‘ shambolic , disgraceful and inept ’			1
she told the @entity52 : ‘ i was assaulted where i should have felt safest , in the arms of my husband			1
i called the police and went through the ordeal of giving evidence because this man violated the sanctity of my marriage			0
' during the trial i suffered an extremely unpleasant and traumatic cross-examination , only to then find out that the @entity34 were n’t even challenging his sleepwalking defence			0
‘ i was violated by this man and then i was betrayed by the @entity34			0
i am now having to have counselling as i became continually tearful and anxious after the assault and i suffer horrific nightmares			0
’ the case is the latest in a series of controversial trials in which men have claimed they can not be held accountable for rapes or sexual assaults because they suffer from the rare sleep condition known as parasomnia , nicknamed ‘ sexsomnia ’ because of its use as a defence in sex crime trials			1
following the attack , mr @entity9 was assessed for three nights at the private @entity85 and diagnosed with a sleep disorder after a doctor hired by the defence saw his arms and legs move while he was asleep			2
but the prosecution ’s medical expert did not assess mr @entity9 independently and both of these doctors worked for the same chain of private clinics			2
neither expert was called to give evidence or face cross-examination at the trial and the jury was simply presented with their reports that mr @entity9 suffered from a sleep disorder			2
the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , said : ‘ it is a farce that the @entity34 did n’t challenge his defence properly			0
the law needs to change to stop other victims being let down by justice			0
’ the attack happened in february 2012 after the woman and her husband celebrated a friend ’s birthday at a @entity117 restaurant			2
mr @entity9 , a self - employed marketing consultant , and his wife @entity119 , 40 , were also there and several couples returned to a friend ’s house after the meal			1
he had been drinking heavily and was left to sleep on a sofa while his wife went alone to a hotel			0
the victim and her husband slept on a bed in the same room as mr @entity9			1
she said she was still wearing her tights and underwear when she woke to find mr @entity9 attacking her			2
‘ i was lying on my side , curled up , and he grabbed my shoulder and flipped me onto my back , ’ she said			2
' @entity137 ' : @entity9 's wife @entity119 gave evidence on her husband 's behalf , saying he would have sex with her while he was asleep ‘ i stopped him and he got up and tried to run away			1
i was screaming and hysterical and i called the police immediately			0
’ the attack lasted seconds and her husband only woke when she started screaming			2
mr @entity9 was charged with sexual assault and stood trial at @entity150 in august			2
the jury was told he suffered from insane automatism , a defence which means a defendant had no conscious knowledge of his actions and can not be held responsible for them			0
the jury found mr @entity9 was not guilty ‘ by reason of insanity ’ , a rare verdict which meant he was still put on the @entity160 for five years and was told to undergo medical treatment			1
mr @entity9 , who shares a £ 1.5million home in affluent @entity165 , @entity166 , with his wife , has agreed to pay the £ 3,900 bill for a year of private treatment for his sleep disorder			0
the judge also imposed a @entity172 banning from him from sleeping at friends ’ homes or any private home unless he has previously told householders he suffers from a sleep disorder and given details of his conviction			0
judge @entity180 said he had been assessed as posing a ‘ medium risk of serious harm ’ to others , and said the risk would rise if he slept near women			1
she said : ‘ steps must be taken to reduce the risk which , in my view , you still pose ... it seems to me that i have to have an eye to the protection of the public			0
’ the victim says in her letter to mr @entity26 : ‘ having experienced the trauma of my case being handled in such a shambolic manner , it is not surprising women are unwilling to report sexual crimes to the police			0
’ the @entity34 said it did seek to challenge the defence ’s medical evidence			0
its website sets out its policy on sleepwalking defences , saying : ‘ it is essential that this defence is robustly challenged			0
’ @entity209 , defending mr @entity9 , said : ‘ he was effectively not culpable for those actions			1
’ mr @entity9 ’s solicitor , @entity212 , said : ‘ my client is content that the jury accepted the account he provided from the start was the truth			1
‘ three experts were instructed and examined him – one by the defence and a second by the prosecution			0
the third – jointly appointed by the prosecution and defence – then endorsed the findings of the first two			0
all three experts agreed his actions occurred while in a sleep - induced state			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
