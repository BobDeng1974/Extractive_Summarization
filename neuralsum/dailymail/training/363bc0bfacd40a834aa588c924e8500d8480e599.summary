by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 11 january 2014 updated : 01:55 est , 12 january 2014 embattled @entity3 third baseman @entity2 has been banned for the entire 2014 season			1
arbitrator @entity5 handed down the 162 - game suspension saturday in a historic decision that @entity2 announced shortly after he intended to fight in federal court			1
it includes the postseason , should the @entity3 qualify			0
the season - long ban is a reduction from the 211 - game suspension initially imposed by @entity14 commissioner @entity13 , but is a win for the league since it was clear from the beginning it wanted him gone for all of 2014			1
yer outta there ! : @entity21 will not be able to step foot on a baseball field again until he is almost 40 - years - old judge and jury : arbitrator @entity5 , who handed down the 162 - game suspension , pictured in 2009 the arbitrator ’s decision is another chapter in what has been a dramatic five months for the steroid - tainted slugger that saw him spend the majority of the season rehabbing from injury only to be hit with the historic suspension			1
he was one of a dozen players suspended as part of the @entity40 investigation			0
all but one of the other players suspended received 50 - game bans , @entity45 left fielder received a 65 - game suspension that he accepted			2
they all accepted their bans , but he immediately appealed			0
the next week saw a series of terse press conferences as the game ’s highest paid player grinded through a rehab assignment at @entity55 and followed each game with three - ring - circus press conferences accusing the @entity3 of trying to keep him off the field			0
an all - time great : mr @entity2 has 654 career home runs , good for fifth-most in baseball history unprecedented : @entity2 ban is the longest @entity65 - related suspension in baseball history the one - time @entity68 champion made it on to the field for the final month of the season and vowed to take his fight against the suspension as far as he had to get it overturned			1
‘ the number of games sadly comes as no surprise , as the deck has been stacked against me from day one , ’ he said in a statement			0
‘ this is one man 's decision , that was not put before a fair and impartial jury , does not involve me having failed a single drug test			0
’ the 14 - time all - star and his legal team said the suspension ‘ is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the @entity90 and the @entity91			1
’ ‘ [ it ] relies on testimony and documents that would never have been allowed in any court in the @entity97 because they are false and wholly unreliable , ’ the statement continued			0
another long road back : the fading slugger spent almost the entire 2013 season rehabbing his injured hip , he will now not be allow back on a baseball field for one full year ‘ i have been clear that i did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline , or violate the @entity91 or the @entity90 in any manner , and in order to prove it i will take this fight to federal court			1
’ mr @entity2 has long argued that accusations stemming from the @entity40 performance enhancing drug investigation lacks credibility , and that evidence against him was obtained illegally			0
he even famously once walked out of an arbitration hearing late last year in protest over mr @entity13 not being forced to testify – he said he was being treated unfairly			0
the player ’s union stood by the player in a statement of their own			0
‘ the @entity124 strongly disagrees with the award issued today in the grievance of @entity2 , even despite the arbitration panel 's decision to reduce the duration of mr. @entity2 's unprecedented 211 - game suspension			1
’ the ballplayer ’s legal team tried to argue that @entity40 founder @entity40 was a consultant , but @entity14 reportedly produced mountains of evidence to the contrary , and was able to portray a close relationship between the two men			0
mr @entity40 also testified to the contrary during the arbitration hearing			0
mr @entity2 arrives oct 1 at the offices of @entity14 in @entity141 for an arbitration hearing evidence linking mr @entity40 to @entity146 was first published last january in the @entity147 , a spokesperson for mr @entity144 denied at the time he had any ties to the clinic			2
naming @entity2 and a host other ballplayers to investigate , and once investigators dug the paper trail led to the man whose 654 career home runs rank fifth all - time			1
the three - time mvp stands to lose at least $ 25million for missing the 2014 season , per the widely reported terms of his record - setting contract			1
he was also set to earn a $ 6million bonus if he hit a mere six home runs during the season to tie @entity163 with 660 all - time			1
mr @entity2 will still earn a $ 3million bonus jan 15 despite the suspension since he agreed to defer his signing bonus			2
the 38 - year - old is signed through the end of the 2017 season , and the team still owes him at least $ 84million through those seasons			2
since he will be almost 40 by the time he is allowed back on the field , he may have already played his final games .			2

@entity2 has been banned for all 162 regular season games and the *playoffs* for the *upcoming* season
the suspension is 49 games less than the *original* 211 game ban he was given last year
@entity2 will be almost 40 - years - old by the time he is allowed to play again
he has vowed to appeal in federal court
