mixed @entity1 is the biggest growing sport in the world and every thursday , @entity0 will bring you a buzzing story			0
their five - star @entity6 “ @entity7 ” helps you follow the @entity8 24 - 7 : download now @entity10 title shots do n't come around all too often			1
they are rarely earned without sacrifice and can serve as a fighter 's career - defining accomplishment			0
but as difficult as it is to cement a shot at promotional gold , it 's even tougher to take advantage of the opportunity			0
and for those challengers who taste defeat only to feel their time in the spotlight slip away , forging a divisional comeback is the only way to patch the wound			0
here are three recently vanquished title threats who may be close to earning another shot at gold			1
@entity31 @entity32 standout @entity31 resides in a division dictated by arguably the most dominant champion around in @entity35			2
but considering @entity31 is the flyweight version of @entity38 , meaning he does n't lose outside of a title fight , the two men should cross paths once more			1
@entity31 ( right ) kicks @entity41 in their flyweight bout during the @entity10 event in november @entity41 ( right ) punches @entity31 in their flyweight bout during the @entity10 @entity46 event expected to take on fellow @entity50 leftover @entity48 at @entity10 , the 30 - year - old has a chance to extend his current win streak to three			1
and in a weight class as shallow as a glass of water , @entity31 could once again find himself fighting for a title by the end of 2015 ( if not early next year )			1
he 's a premier draw at 125 pounds , and one of only a few contenders who can actually instil some doubt about the champ 's unheralded reign			0
@entity64 despite a recent jump up to welterweight and an impressive finish over rising contender @entity68 , former lightweight champ @entity64 is still in the mix at 155 pounds			2
add in the fact that @entity71 just handed his title over to @entity73 at @entity10 185 , and @entity64 should have an easier track back to contention considering @entity76 had beaten him twice			1
@entity64 ( left ) lands a kick to the body of @entity68 in their welterweight fight @entity64 attempts a submission against @entity68 in their welterweight fight last month while @entity84 also defeated @entity85 via knockout less than one year ago , it was a close contest before the @entity86 landed on unforeseen uppercut that shortly put @entity64 on another planet			2
needless to say , the 31 - year - old is still in the pinnacle of his career and remains one of the most dangerous entities in the deepest division in @entity8			0
he 'll be able to log two more octagon appearances by the end of the year and will have enough momentum to earn a shot should he win both outings			0
@entity103 with an epic showdown between featherweight kingpin @entity106 and @entity108 sensation @entity107 looming in the distance , guys like @entity103 are being drastically overlooked			2
while @entity106 swiftly defended his title opposite @entity111 at @entity112 , @entity103 did enough in the championships rounds to suggest an upset could happen should he dominate early			1
@entity103 punches @entity115 in their featherweight bout in @entity118 last november @entity103 knocks @entity115 to the mat with a kick in their featherweight fight but in order to get back into the mix in a division ruled by two international dynamos , the 32 - year - old @entity123 must debunk the evolving arsenal of former title contender @entity129 when the two collide at @entity131			1
@entity129 is another name that could easily make this list , but he is at least two impressive victories away from a trilogy fight with the champion			0
of course , if @entity107 captures the title from @entity106 in july at @entity139 , then all slates will be wiped clean .			0

@entity31 could soon be set for another shot at a @entity10 title
@entity64 and @entity103 also make the list
