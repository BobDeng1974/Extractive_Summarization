by @entity0 for @entity1 the @entity2 has effectively grounded uber - style flight - sharing services that allowed passengers to hitch a ride with private pilots			1
a legal ruling by the @entity2 on wednesday said pilots were generally not allowed to advertise available seats on their planes and accept payment for fuel costs unless they have commercial licenses			2
that premise - connecting private , small plane pilots with passengers - was the basis for @entity16 and several other online start - ups that were hoping to do for the skies what @entity19 and @entity20 have done for sharing apartments and hailing cabs			1
it seems now that the concept may have crashed before it even got a chance to get off the ground			0
@entity16 and other services allowed private pilots and passengers going to the same destination to connect and exchange payment for fuel and flight costs ( stock image ) @entity16 asked for legal advice from the @entity2 on whether its business model was permissible			1
@entity2 assistant counsel for international law @entity38 responded : ' in your request for legal interpretation , you maintain that the @entity16 service is not a commercial operation and does not involve common carriage because there is no compensation for pilots			1
' @entity16 maintains that the company satisfies a big demand for paring passengers who want to get away and pilots who are hoping to save some cash on their next flight			2
' there ’s a really deep underlying economic basis			0
it ’s much more than a fad for the shared economy because you have all these assets around that are being underutilized , ' @entity16 ceo @entity58 told @entity64			0
@entity16 operated as a ' car pooling for the skies ' - like an @entity19 for planes - that allowed passengers and pilots to split the cost of a private plane flight the ' sharing economy ' has led to major success for companies like @entity20 and @entity19			1
@entity20 , which lets users circumvent traditional taxi services by summoning private cabs from the smart phones , is worth an estimated $ 17billion			0
@entity19 , which allows people to rent out their apartments - or rooms in their homes - for short periods of time raised $ 500billion from investors in april			0
@entity16 and similar companies like @entity87 say they will continue to negotiate with the @entity2 to find a way to operate within the rules			2
in the meantime , the flight sharing board has gone dry			0
there are currently no available flight sharing offers listed in major markets on @entity16			0
the @entity2 ruling leaves one small glimmer of hope for the future of flight sharing			0
the regulator said that existing laws allow private pilots to receive payment for fuel and maintenance from passengers - as long as the fliers had already planned to travel to a specific destination			1
the rule had previously been exercised through world - of - mouth and offline ride boards , however , and the @entity2 said that @entity16 's system did n't operate within the narrow definition of the law .			1

@entity2 legal opinion came after @entity16 asked the agency to review its business model
@entity16 and similar start - ups connected passengers and pilots who were going to the same destination
under the system , passengers paid for their portion of fuel and other flight costs
the @entity2 ruled this did not meet the narrow legal requirements and *amounted* to *illegal* compensation for private pilots
