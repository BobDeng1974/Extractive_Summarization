by @entity1 reporter published : 01:00 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 01:00 est , 18 june 2013 a woman fired from her teaching job because of a menacing , abusive ex-husband 's behavior is back in the news			1
but this time it 's good news			0
thanks to her courage leading her to take her story to television , @entity10 has been offered a fresh start with a brand new teaching position			1
sometime after her story aired on @entity18 local news , @entity10 was contacted by a concerned viewer			1
the woman , who did not want to release her name , runs a private school in @entity23 and offered to take @entity10 on as a new employee			1
brave : @entity10 thought her career as a teacher was over when she took her story -- of being fired for being the victim of constant domestic violence -- to local television and @entity10 , who thought all the publicity would spell the end of her career as a teacher , was overcome by emotion			2
' it 's good to know that people generally care about other people , ' a teary - eyed @entity10 told @entity18 's @entity38 7			1
though @entity10 said she would be willing to relocate for the job , she and the good @entity39 still have much to discuss			2
nonetheless , the offer itself was enough to bring hope back to a woman whose life was so recently torn apart			0
a victim of domestic violence has been fired from her job as a sixth - grade teacher in @entity50 because the private school have deemed it too dangerous to keep employing her			1
darker days : second - grade teacher @entity10 says the diocese that runs her school called her a liability and fired her because of her menacing ex-husband @entity10 recently received a letter from the @entity58 informing her that her ex-husband ’s ‘ threatening and menacing behavior ’ was too much of a concern , and they could no longer allow her to work at @entity63 in @entity64			1
the shocking decision not only impacted @entity10 ’s career and ability to earn , but her four children who also attended the school have also been barred from returning			1
‘ they ’ve taken away my ability to care for my kids , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s not like i can go out and find a teaching job anywhere			1
’ the incident dates back to january when @entity10 was forced to call police after what she called ‘ a very bad weekend with him			0
’ the next day , she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband , @entity81			0
not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown			0
since then @entity10 and her four children have not returned to the school			1
her ex-husband was jailed on two felony charges , but is due to be released later this month			0
a letter was sent to parents at the time of the incident explaining what happened and explaining that @entity10 and her children had been put on ‘ indefinite leave			2
’ in a letter from the @entity53 who runs @entity63 , @entity10 was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was ' too dangerous ' three months later @entity10 received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the @entity53 means she is now barred from working at any of its area schools			1
the letter from the @entity53 explained that @entity10 was being fired because of her husband ’s ‘ twenty - plus year history of violence , abuse , and harassment of people - mostly women			0
’ ‘ we know from the most recent incident involving you and mrs. @entity115 ( the principal ) while you were still physically at @entity63 , that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him , ’ stated the letter			0
‘ although we understand he is currently incarcerated , we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall			0
' in the interest of the safety of the students , faculty and parents at @entity63 , we simply can not allow you to return to work there , or , unfortunately , at any other school in the @entity53			2
’ @entity10 , who says she feels like she ’s being treated like a criminal , has hired a lawyer and intends to sue the school			2
but @entity38 reports that several parents at the school said the district did the right thing in a no - win situation because they feared for the safety of their own children			0
there was even a movement to ' pull kids out of the school ' if @entity10 returned			2
' i mean that ’s why women of domestic violence do n’t come forward , because they ’re afraid of the way people are going to see them , view them , perceive them , treat them , ' said @entity10			0
@entity10 received this letter from the @entity58 informing her that she was sacked			1

an employee at a @entity23 private school wants to give @entity10 a second chance and has offered her a new teaching job , miles from her menacing ex-husband
@entity10 lost her @entity18 job because her employer was concerned about her ex-husband 's ' threatening and menacing behavior '
the decision prevented her from working for any schools under the control of the @entity58
her four children were also barred from returning to @entity63 in @entity64
