the @entity2 drew 1 - 1 with @entity7 's side at the @entity8 and @entity1 was full of praise for a player he previously coached at @entity12 before bringing him to the @entity13 during the summer			1

praise : @entity2 boss @entity1 was impressed with @entity4 's ( right ) display against @entity5 impressed : @entity1 thought @entity4 showed his direct ability as a winger against @entity5 at the @entity8 @entity1 said : ' when i first saw him , no. but he was learning , listening			2

' he is confident with the position that we play him , he knows what we want from him			0
when it 's clear , it 's supposed to be easy			0

' unexpected : @entity1 did not think that @entity4 would make it as a @entity20 player when at @entity12 @entity2 retain an interest in @entity44 forward @entity43			1
they hope to tie up another loan deal for the @entity46 , similar to the one they agreed last season , but are unlikely to buy him for £ 14million			0
@entity51 's @entity50 forward @entity49 is also a target			2
