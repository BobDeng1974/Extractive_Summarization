it was one of the most astonishing battles in the animal world - when a snake decided it was going to swallow a whole crocodile for lunch			1
if it seems an impossible notion , these photos show the astonishing result as the snake slithered slowly away with the crocodile filling its body			1
local woman @entity13 saw the snake , a python , heading towards the freshwater crocodile on the edge of @entity18 , some 12 miles north east of @entity19 , in outback @entity20 , reported the @entity21			1
no matter how much the crocodile struggled , it had no hope of freeing itself from the snake ’s powerful body			0
it was n’t long before life was squeezed out of the croc			0
wisely deciding not to intervene , ms @entity13 quietly took photographs of the rare event as the snake turned to the object of the attack and began slowly consuming the reptile			2
that seemingly impossible task took a little more time but eventually the entire crocodile disappeared through the python ’s mouth			0
then , twice its normal size , the snake slowly made its way into the nearby swamp bushes to digest its hearty meal			0
try as it might , once the crocodile was caught in the python 's death grip , it could not fight its way free once the snake had killed the crocodile , it proceeded to swallow it whole once the snake had devoured the crocodile it slithered off , double its original size , to digest the croc in peace			2
