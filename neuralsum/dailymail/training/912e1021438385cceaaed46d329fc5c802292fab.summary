@entity0 is a small island - and @entity1 is the smallest capital in the @entity3			1
but now the former @entity5 colony is getting a planet - sized chunk of attention			2
this month , the @entity9 will represent the @entity10 on her first official overseas trip without @entity12 ( or @entity13 ) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of @entity0 independence			1
truly splendid : @entity1 may be the @entity3 's smallest capital , but it has one of the continent 's finest skylines already the island has gone @entity21			2
people could talk of little else as i travelled around @entity0 and its neighbour , @entity25			1
as if that was n’t enough , @entity26 - the newly wed @entity27 and @entity28 - have been in @entity30 , written by @entity28			1
the couple took over the secluded pebble beach of @entity33			2
@entity34 will feel at home on @entity0 , where 150 years of @entity5 rule have left their mark			1
the @entity0 drive on the left , @entity5 phone and post boxes are everywhere , there ’s even a @entity44 in @entity1 - and they still use three - pin electric plugs			1
what ’s more , @entity0 has been held in great affection by the @entity10 for nearly 70 years			1
between 1949 and 1951 , as princess @entity48 , she lived just outside @entity1 , when prince @entity49 was stationed there as a naval officer			2
famous faces : @entity34 of @entity53 ( left ) will in @entity0 for an official visit on 20 and 21 september ; ( right ) newlywed @entity28 has been on @entity25 with new husband @entity27 , filming her latest project @entity55 the links were strengthened during the war when the island came under @entity60 bombardment			1
it held out and was awarded the @entity62 by @entity63 as a result			2
it ’s a pity the @entity9 will be there for only two days - there ’s so much to see on these small , but fascinating islands			2
@entity0 is by far the larger of the two , and the more crowded , while @entity25 is the deserted , rural cousin			1
do take the regular 25 - minute ferry across the channel that separates the islands			0
both are so rich in history that i swam off the golden - red sands of @entity75 , on northern @entity25 , without realising its significance			1
only later did i discover this was the beach where @entity79 , hero of @entity80 , was washed up , clinging on to a timber , the last fragment of his shipwrecked boat			0
he was given refuge in a nearby cave by @entity88 , a drop - dead gorgeous nymph			0
he promptly hopped into bed with her			0
sadly , in reality , @entity88 ’s @entity94 , on the hill overlooking the bay , was depressingly short on attractive nymphs			0
back on @entity0 , @entity1 was a delight			1
it ’s only a three - hour flight from @entity99 , but it feels tropical : a place where @entity101 meets @entity102			0
@entity103 is only 50 miles to the north ; @entity105 176 miles west			2
happy days : the queen ( then princess @entity48 ) and prince @entity108 survey @entity1 harbour while living on @entity0 the city is built on a grid , like an early @entity112 , but there are no skyscrapers and all but essential traffic is banned			1
at its heart is @entity118 , built by the @entity119 from 1573			0
the knights - from @entity101 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 - competed to produce the most ornate chapels			0
the result is a blingy series of gilded rooms , studded with baroque monuments			0
the generous knights gave two caravaggios , of @entity131 and the beheading of @entity133 , to the cathedral			0
as a crucial naval port , @entity1 once had a rackety side , concentrated on @entity139 , in the heart of the city			0
nicknamed ‘ the @entity143 ’ by heavy drinking sailors , it was once thick with brothels , bars and seedy lodging houses			0
these days , the @entity143 has cleaned up its act - i ate well at @entity150 , a 16th - century palace at 54 strait street , run by the pretty , young @entity152 sisters , @entity153 and @entity154			0
for a grander experience of @entity0 , stay at the @entity156 , which the @entity10 and prince @entity49 visited for naval parties when they lived on @entity0			1
it has all the charms of a grand colonial hotel - along with free wi - fi and excellent service			0
i can understand how @entity79 could n’t tear himself away from @entity0 and @entity25 for seven years			1
you might find it just as difficult to leave			0
double rooms at the @entity167 ( 00356 2291 1023 , www.phoeniciamalta.com ) cost from £ 100 a night , room only			0
@entity169 ( www.easyjet.com ) flies to @entity0 from @entity170 from £ 42 return .			1

@entity34 of @entity53 will visit the island on 20 and 21 september
this , her first solo royal tour , will mark 50 years of @entity0 independence
@entity28 and @entity27 have been filming on neighbouring @entity25
