by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity3 - @entity2 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity4 has revealed he would love to be the next manager of @entity6			1
the 62 - year - old @entity7 will be unveiled as the new @entity9 boss next week , once he and the club have agreed the make - up of his coaching staff			1
speaking in @entity14 , the @entity7 national coach said he he is still speaking to other clubs , but was quite happy to let it be known how much he wants the @entity6 job			1
@entity19 : @entity6 biggest club in the world soon to come ? @entity4 sang the praises of @entity6 , saying he 'd love to join @entity6 bound : @entity23 with assistants @entity25 ( centre ) and @entity27 at the @entity7 training camp ‘ i would love the ( @entity6 ) job , ’ @entity23 told @entity29			1
‘ for every coach who takes the job it ’s a fantastic challenge			2
‘ i hope i shall be the one but you ’ll have to wait and see			0
there are more clubs interested			0
it is a process we ’re in and everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs			0
‘ but @entity6 are the biggest club in the world ’			1
@entity6 had hoped to officially unveil @entity23 as @entity47 ’ replacement this week			1
they have agreed most of the details with the former @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity52 coach but want to announce his appointment , and the composition of his coaching staff , all at the same time , rather than have a drip - feed of information as was the case when @entity47 took the job last year			0
@entity6 also have to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the @entity7 fa			1
@entity14 have a @entity63 to prepare for under @entity23 and understandably do not want their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach ’s future beyond @entity69 2014			1
where do i sign ? @entity23 pens autographs for young @entity7 fans at the @entity63 training camp through the door : @entity23 says @entity6 are the biggest club in the world as @entity23 gets ready to take over , @entity77 , one of the @entity6 coaching team under the sacked @entity47 , revealed how the @entity9 lap of honour after tuesday ’s 3 - 1 win over @entity82 was the emptiest moment of his career			1
@entity77 could not hide his pain as he spoke about the traumas of a season that reduced @entity89 ’s most successful club to an object of fun			1
‘ it ’s been a real difficult season , ’ said @entity77			2
‘ a club that should be challenging for league titles to finish seventh is obviously not good enough			0
and to see a man who , for the last eight years , has put so much confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the toughest days i ’ve had in football			0
‘ walking around the pitch after the @entity82 game was probably the emptiest i ’ve ever felt on a football field			0
i took the job expecting to be walking around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league title or parading a league title			0
that ’s what this club demands and we ’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that			0
’ all smiles : it is unknown whether current interim manager @entity118 will stay at @entity9 it has been the fall of @entity47 that has particularly stung @entity77			1
‘ he has taken the majority of criticism from outside the club , but if you speak to anyone inside then we ’ve all got to take collective responsibility — from players , the staff , the coaching staff , everybody , ’ said @entity77			1
‘ it was really disappointing when @entity47 lost his job because @entity135 him as a friend			0
as a player , i ’ve never experienced anything like that with a manager — maybe once with @entity140 at @entity89 , when he lost his job			0
‘ the thing we ’ve all collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games ( in all competitions ) at @entity9 this season			2
‘ if we played all our games away , then we ’d be champions			0
but we ’ve lost games at @entity9 against teams that we should be beating			2
that has been the biggest single failing			0
’ happy : but @entity77 , with @entity153 , slammed @entity6 's dismal season @entity77 ’s future , and that of the rest of the class of ’ 92 — @entity118 , @entity159 and @entity160 — is uncertain pending @entity23 ’s arrival after sunday ’s final game of the season against @entity164 but @entity77 is keen to stay on			1
‘ i do n’t know what ’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job , ’ said @entity77			2
‘ but the season as a whole has just not been good enough			0
we ’ve got to make sure next season , whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching , that we get back challenging for league titles			0
‘ i want to be part of @entity6 ’s future , i ’m a @entity6 person , i love the club			1
‘ results aside , it ’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that i love			2
i want to be here for the rest of my life , being involved with @entity6			2
so that ’s my hope			0
’ axed : but @entity77 insisted the blame for the campaign does not lie solely with @entity47 @entity77 was speaking at the launch of the @entity29 ’s @entity63 coverage .			1
