by @entity0 from @entity1 to @entity3 winner @entity2 , the colourful , beautifully embroidered rebozo has long proved popular with stylish creatives			1
but it was n't always so as an exhibition opening early next month at @entity9 's @entity8 reveals			1
loved by revolutionaries who sported it during the @entity13 , the garment has since become synonymous with @entity15 culture as well as a fixture in the nation 's wardrobes			1
popular : the rebozo remains an integral part of @entity15 culture , as seen in the @entity24 / @entity23 collection ironically for a garment beloved of revolutionaries , the rebozo started life as a relative of the @entity31 mantilla shawl - introduced to @entity15 when colonisers arrived in the @entity33 in the wake of early explorers @entity36 and sir @entity37			1
even its name derives from @entity31 @entity40 , with the word rebozo translated as the act of covering or protecting yourself , as defined by 17th century grammarian , @entity45			2
nevertheless , the garment , known to nahuatl - speakers [ @entity48 ] as ' ciua nequealtlapacholoni ' , was soon adopted by the locals and given a colourful makeover that included native textiles and embroidery techniques			2
by the 1800s , its popularity was such that all women , regardless of their ethnicity or social class , wore them , whether at work , home or church			0
stunning : a modern @entity64 design , as worn by @entity65 and styled by @entity66 iconic : an indigenous @entity15 woman shows how to wear the rebozo ( left ) and right , artist @entity1 later , during the @entity70 , the garment was worn by @entity71 , wife of @entity15 's first and only @entity73 emperor , @entity74 but @entity71 was n't the only one to wear it			2
along with famous proponents such as @entity1 , who popularised the garment abroad , the rebozo also proved a hit with a very different sort of wearer - the revolutionary			0
the @entity13 brought the rebozo global notoriety as the garment of choice for the ' @entity87 women who used it to smuggle guns and other weapons past government checkpoints			1
by the time the strife ended in 1920 , with a victory for the @entity95 [ @entity95 ] , the rebozo had become synonymous with @entity15 's struggle for independence			1
today , the garment remains a key part of @entity15 national dress , the @entity101 , and represents the journey from birth to death , thanks to its use as both a baby carrier and a shroud			1
the new exhibition celebrates all of its many uses as well as drawing heavily on the collection of @entity113 diplomat @entity112 , who between 1902 and 1906 lived and worked in @entity114			0
stunning : @entity116 's @entity115 ( left ) and @entity117 both feature rebozos one of the first to recognise the rebozo 's cultural significance , @entity112 collected thousands of pieces , some of which will go on display in @entity9 for the first time			0
another to contribute work to the exhibition is @entity129 designer @entity128 who has created a unique rebozo of her own			2
other highlights include work by @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , while an installation by artist @entity137 takes a closer look at the ‘ aroma de luto ’ rebozo and its use as a death shroud			0
commenting on the exhibition , @entity142 , head of the @entity8 , said : ‘ this important exhibition powerfully demonstrates the vibrancy of textiles in historic and contemporary @entity15			1
' we are delighted to be showing the work of leading @entity15 artists , designers and museums , in the only @entity129 building designed by @entity15 architect @entity153			0
' made in @entity15 : the @entity154 in @entity155 opens on the 6th june and runs until the 30th august			0
