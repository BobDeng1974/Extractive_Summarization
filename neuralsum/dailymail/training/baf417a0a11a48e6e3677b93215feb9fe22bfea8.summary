by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:33 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 30 september 2013 @entity2 was hit by a fresh race row yesterday after a senior aide to @entity5 referred to a @entity7 journalist as being ‘ of some form of ethnic extraction ’			1
@entity10 , the party ’s chief press officer , came under fire after he accidentally texted the description to one of the journalist ’s colleagues			1
mr @entity10 , who is also a lead candidate for the party in next year ’s @entity19 elections , insisted he had meant no offence and wearily referred to himself as ‘ today ’s comedy racist ’			1
but @entity23 @entity22 called for him to apologise			1
row : @entity10 , left , referred to journalist @entity24 , right , as being ' of some form of ethnic extraction ' @entity27 , secretary of the backbench 1992 committee , said : ‘ there ’s no room in any walk of life , let alone politics , for this type of racially insensitive language			1
’ fellow @entity23 @entity37 added : ‘ it ’s outrageous			1
nobody in 2013 should use language like this – especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country			0
’ it comes after @entity44 faced criticism for complaining about foreign aid going to ‘ @entity47 ’ and mr @entity5 referred to ‘ coloured people ’ in a radio interview			2
last week a @entity2 councillor insisted he was not racist – because he has been on holiday to the @entity52			0
@entity53 , 83 , repeatedly insisted ‘ i like coloured people ’ as the party again faced claims it was out of touch with modern @entity57			2
mr @entity10 is one of mr @entity5 ’s closest aides and runs the party ’s communications operation			1
he is standing for the party in next year ’s @entity19 elections and is the candidate to become mp for @entity65			1
in a text message exchange he was informing @entity2 organisers of a visit to @entity69 by mr @entity5			1
he warned that there would be two journalists from the @entity72 meeting them at @entity74 station			0
he wrote : ‘ @entity75 , my fault but i told the @entity72 that @entity5 would be arriving at approx. 10.30 this morning			2
publicity : the row risked distracting from @entity2 leader @entity5 's visit to @entity69 where he hopes to woo disaffected @entity80 ‘ they have called and i expect a snapper and a female journalist ( of some form of ethnic extraction ) at @entity74			1
’ the remark about @entity24 , a @entity7 journalist who works for the @entity72 , sparked a furious backlash			2
mr @entity10 rejected the claim he was racist , telling reporters his wife is @entity91			2
but he added : ‘ i am today ’s comedy racist			0
’ he blamed a poor quality answerphone message in which he had not picked up the ‘ multi-syllabled ’ name of the journalist			0
he later told @entity96 : ‘ if i ’d got the right name i would have used it but i did n’t so i needed to give a head up ‘ i was thinking of using the term “ babe ” but they are n’t going to have the first idea what i ’m going on about			0
’ but @entity80 at their party conference in @entity69 condemned the remarks			2
@entity27 told the @entity72 : ‘ there ’s no room in any walk of life , let alone politics , for this type of racially insensitive language			0
’ apology : @entity2 councillor @entity53 , from @entity115 , repeatedly referred to ' coloured people ' during a tv interview but denied being racist @entity37 added : ‘ it ’s outrageous			0
nobody in 2013 should use language like this — especially if you want to be seen as fit to run the country			0
’ the row distracted attention from mr @entity5 ’s appearnces in @entity69 where he tried to woo @entity23 to back his party in next year ’s @entity130 elections			1
mr @entity5 insisted mr @entity10 ’s remark was ‘ not meant maliciously ’ and only people who were ‘ very silly ’ could consider it to be racist			1
asked whether mr @entity10 should be sacked for the comment , he added : ‘ what would you suggest , prison camp ? forced labour ? ’ mr @entity5 has tried to repair the party ’s reputation in recent weeks , insisting it had ‘ grown up ’ and was ready to win seats in the @entity143			1

asked about @entity2 ’s immigration policy , he said : ‘ i have already had heated arguments about that			0
‘ i have been to the @entity151			0
i have sampled their hospitality			0
