by @entity0 @entity1 has unveiled a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that aims to prevent another government shutdown which boosts funding slightly for military and domestic programs - but not for ' @entity7 ' health reforms			1
with a deadline looming at midnight tomorrow for new spending authority , lawmakers will still need a three - day stop - gap funding extension to ensure enough time for passage of the spending bill this week			1
the measure eases across - the - board spending cuts by providing an extra $ 45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014 , to a total of $ 1.012 trillion			1
it also provides an additional $ 85.2 billion for @entity20 war funding that is typically handled off - budget			1
' ca n't please everyone ' : @entity24 chair @entity23 ( center ) said a new $ 1.1trillion spending bill unveiled by @entity1 yesterday could not reflect the wants of just one party the spending measure fills in the details of a budget agreement passed in december in the aftermath of a 16 - day shutdown of many government agencies in october			1
the shutdown was prompted largely by disputes over funding for ' @entity7 ' health insurance reforms			1
although many programs will get a slight increase over 2013 levels and avoid steep cuts previously slated for this year , the proposed bill does not provide any increase for implementation of the @entity7 , president @entity46 's signature healthcare reform law			2
according to a @entity50 @entity49 summary , a public health fund will be reduced by $ 1 billion to prevent @entity51 secretary @entity52 from ' raiding ' these funds to spend on @entity7 insurance exchanges			1
boost : the bill provides an extra $ 85.2 billion for @entity20 war funding that is typically handled off - budget the chairs of the @entity24 and @entity50 said in a joint statement that the deal will eliminate the economic instability caused by @entity1 ' recent funding battles			1
' as with any compromise , not everyone will like everything in this bill , but in this divided government a critical bill such as this simply can not reflect the wants of only one party , ' @entity72 senator @entity23 of @entity73 and @entity49 representative @entity74 of @entity75 said in a statement			1
@entity78 budget director @entity77 said the measure will help fund critical investments in education and infrastructure			0
' this legislation adheres to the funding levels in the budget agreement enacted in december , unwinds some of the damaging cuts caused by sequestration , ' she said in a statement			0
the military avoids about $ 22 billion in the across - the - board cuts , with total non-war spending of about $ 520.5 billion under the bill , while agencies focused on domestic programs will get $ 491.8 billion , representing an increase of about $ 22 billion over sequester levels			1
blow : the proposed bill does not provide any increase in funding for implementation of the @entity7 , president @entity46 's signature healthcare reform law but some controversial budget items took a hit			2
the spending measure provides no funds for high - speed rail projects , and it again denied a funding transfer needed to pay for critical reforms to the @entity110			2
but both @entity49 and @entity72 touted a provision in the bill that reverses planned military pension cuts for disabled veterans , a controversial part of the december budget deal that helped pay for about $ 6 billion in new spending			2
military retirees of working age were to see smaller cost - of - living increases in their pensions starting in 2015 , but it was later discovered that the change was inadvertently applied to disabled veterans and survivors of deceased veterans as well			2
while the spending bill will reverse the cuts for disabled veterans and survivors , many republicans in @entity1 still want to cancel the cuts for all retired military service members			0
negotiations on the measure bogged down as lawmakers attempted to attach policy provisions on issues ranging from restricting abortions to curtailing regulation of carbon emissions			0
many of these were successfully fought off , including new abortion provisions , @entity23 told reporters			0
@entity72 aides said the bill includes no new provisions prohibiting regulations on greenhouse gas emissions , nor forestry and stream management			0
they also prevented new gun - rights language from inclusion			0
but @entity49 did get a policy provision into the measure that prohibits funding of the @entity46 administration 's ' light bulb standard , ' which prohibits the manufacture of incandescent light bulbs in favor of newer technologies that reduce energy consumption			0
passage of the measure would leave just one more significant fiscal policy hurdle during the current fiscal year which ends on september 30 - an increase in the federal debt limit			0
this will likely be needed by march or april to avoid a default on the @entity173 's debt and the resulting market turmoil .			0

provides an extra $ *45billion* for military and domestic programs for 2014
@entity20 war chest to be boosted by further $ 85.2bn under new plans
but health fund will be cut by $ *1billion* to prevent spending on @entity7
measures aim to ward off second crisis after 16 - day shutdown in october
