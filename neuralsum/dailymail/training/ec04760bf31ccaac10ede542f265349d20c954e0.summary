an eccentric @entity1 man known for his @entity3 costume ended up wearing it even when he was dead , after being embalmed and dressed in the outfit to welcome guests to his own funeral			1
@entity8 , 55 , had found the costume in a box next to be a bin in the city of @entity13 , in the north - eastern @entity14 and was known for wearing it around his local area			1
when he died last week after suffering a severe asthma attack , his family decided it was appropriate that he was also buried in it			1
so after he was embalmed , his body was then propped up in the corner of the hall where the funeral took place under the instructions of his sister @entity27 , 51 , who said : ' it is what he would have wanted			0
he 's pictured here in the outfit at his own funeral @entity8 had found the costume in a box next to be a bin in the city of @entity13 the @entity3 was brought to the big screen in 2011 , with @entity43 playing the superhero she said that she remembered @entity8 had loved reading comic books as a boy and he was a great joker , and loved walking around town in his costume after he found it lying next to a rubbish bin			1
the man 's corpse was not only upright but was surrounded by flowers as he stood in the suit complete with the @entity3 power ring			2
she said : ' he did have really bad asthma and was regularly getting oxygen in the local hospital			0
he used to turn up there as well with his @entity3 costume			1
' when he died it was the thing everybody was talking about , and so we thought it was obviously so much a part of him that we decided to bury him with it			0
' she added : ' in keeping with the @entity1 tradition of embalming bodies for funerals , there was no point in burying him in the suit if nobody saw that he was wearing it , and therefore he was put on display in the funeral hall			2
' the @entity3 was brought to the big screen in 2011 , with @entity43 playing the superhero			2
@entity8 's is just the latest in a number of bizarre funerals in @entity14			1
last june , the body of a builder was taken to the funeral in the shovel of a bulldozer			0
shortly before , a @entity1 octogenarian woman , @entity89 , had a wake dressed in her wedding dress and sitting on her favourite rocking chair			0
@entity8 's is just the latest in a number of bizarre funerals in @entity14 even @entity8 's dog paid homage to the green - themed superhero then there was the boxer who had asked to be dressed in his boxing attire and placed on his feet in the corner of a boxing ring - and the 22 - year - old man who wanted to have his wake held with him riding on the motorcycle he used to ride			1
other cases have included the man who was embalmed and driven around town in one of the ambulances he owned and the man who asked to be dressed as @entity113 , whom he had admired			0
these odd wakes are taken very seriously by the families of the deceased , who say they are attempting to pay tribute in a special way to their loved ones , although local authorities have been trying fruitlessly to find legal ways to prohibit them			0
meanwhile , the practice , which is thought to have originated in @entity14 in 2008 , seems to be spreading to the continental @entity122 and last year @entity123 reported that similar wakes had been held in @entity125 and @entity126 .			0
