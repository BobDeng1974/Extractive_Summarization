by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent @entity2 is completely dependent on his wife @entity3 , but was treated ' disgracefully ' by @entity4 when staff refused to let the couple sit together a severely disabled passenger treated ‘ disgracefully ’ by an airline can not sue for compensation because of a shocking legal loophole , senior judges said yesterday			1
@entity4 staff left @entity2 ‘ humiliated ’ by refusing to let him sit with his wife @entity3 on a plane , even though he needs constant attention and the couple had paid extra to do so			1
but @entity17 judges said the holiday firm had done nothing wrong in law , because airlines are governed by an international convention which says nothing about mistreatment of the disabled			1
cabin crew left mrs @entity27 kneeling in the aircraft aisle trying to look after her husband throughout a flight that lasted more than three hours			1
the airline failed to find a way for the couple to sit together even though they had paid a fee to do so , and despite assuring them twice that they would get the seats they needed			2
@entity39 failed to ask other passengers if they would agree to move to accommodate @entity41 and mrs @entity43 crew did not help even when mr @entity2 ’s wheelchair overturned and he fell to the floor of the aircraft			1
if the couple had been treated the same way on the ground , the firm concerned would have faced criminal prosecution under disability discrimination laws as well as the prospect of a compensation bill			0
but @entity4 will face no sanctions and does not need to pay even token compensation , the judges said , because airline flights and the embarkation of passengers are governed by the @entity61			2
mr @entity2 , 58 , a former pensions administrator , said : ‘ the convention that covers airlines was last rewritten in the 1990s and it did n’t make any allowance for disability			2
’ the judges called for the agreement to be revised urgently to plug the loophole			0
the couple , from @entity70 in @entity71 , went on holiday to the island of @entity74 in @entity75 in 2008 and paid a £ 30 premium to sit together mr @entity2 , who has been paralysed from the shoulders down since a cycling accident at the age of 21 , relies entirely on his wife for such basics as movement and feeding , the court heard			1
