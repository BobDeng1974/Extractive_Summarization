by @entity0 you may not be familiar with the name @entity3 , but you will certainly know her fans			1
the @entity7 accessories designer 's fur and faux fur stoles are regularly seen adorning the necks of the fashionable and the famous			1
among the label 's following are stylemakers including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , to name but a few			1
indeed , @entity14 loves the fuzzy neon wraps so much , she even posed for the @entity3 campaign			2
celebrity fans : @entity15 pictured in her @entity3 emerald green fur cuff ( left ) and @entity14 in her berry red version ( right ) trendsetters : a blonde wig - clad @entity13 wore her @entity24 ' to @entity26 's recent hen party ( left ) while @entity16 chose one in black and bright blue ( right ) @entity28 , the woman behind the much - loved designs , came up with the concept while studying at @entity31 18 months ago			1
now she has 120 stockists across the globe - largely thanks to her celebrity following			0
but while the flashes of neon fur , which cost upwards of £ 155 , have become her signature , @entity35 says she does n't consider herself a ' fur label '			2
friends in high places : @entity14 loves the fuzzy wraps so much , she posed for the @entity3 campaign cosy : @entity46 shared a selfie on @entity48 while wearing @entity3 's dark green hood ' we 've become known for fur pieces - like the fur - trimmed hood and the colourful popsicle scarf - but everything also comes in faux fur , ' she told @entity57			1
brains behind the brand : @entity28 came up with the concept while at @entity31 18 months ago ' i never wanted to do fake fur just to be able to say we offered it , i really wanted to do a product that i believed in			0
nice quality faux fur , that wears well and looks luxurious , is very expensive , and while i understand that some people choose fake fur rather than real as a lifestyle choice , i really did n't want to offer it just as a cheap alternative			1
it needed to be as beautiful as real fur - and in some styles it actually looks better			0
' and her success with fur and faux has spurred her on to experiment with other luxury materials			2
' super-soft cashmere , really chunky knits , woven leather , shearling , silk , lambswool - the pieces have to feel great and the shapes are designed to be easy to wear , ' @entity35 explained			0
nor is the collection solely geared at the twentysomething trendsetters			0
' everything from the hood , to the cuff , to the popsicle can be worn in several ways - and i love to see them being styled in different ways by different girls , ' she added			0
' my mum might wear something that @entity14 has worn , but in a totally different way - i think that 's so cool			0
' must - haves : the @entity3 collection includes fur cuffs ( £ 250 , left ) , fur - trimmed hoods ( from £ 160 , centre ) and two - tone ' popsicles ' ( right , £ 298 )			2

@entity13 , @entity16 and @entity46 are also firm fans of @entity3 's fur and faux fur *neckpieces*
