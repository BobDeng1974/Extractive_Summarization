by @entity0 @entity1 , 34 , cured her hyperhidrosis using new @entity4 treatment ever experienced that awful feeling of lifting your arms only to realise you 're sporting some unwanted dark patches ? even the thought of it is enough to induce a cold sweat			1
but for one unfortunate mother , the crippling embarrassment of having visible sweat patches was a daily occurrence			2
and no amount of deodorant could cure it			0
following the birth of her daughter three and a half years ago , 34 - year - old @entity1 from @entity19 was diagnosed with ' unexplained hyperhidrosis ' , which doctors attributed to hormonal change			1
until the age of 34 , @entity1 had never suffered with sweating			1
as a nurse , she was constantly running around wards , but always managed to control her perspiration with a spritz of deodorant			1
but following the birth of her daughter her sweating became excessive until it reached the point that deodorant was completely ineffective			1
' as a nurse , part of my uniform is to wear the traditional scrubs			2
anyone who suffers with hyperhidrosis will tell you that light colours , blues and greys are a no - go , yet i had no choice , ' she explains			2
' i felt completely embarrassed , as the wet patches would show up on my scrubs			0
i was very aware that the patients would look			0
i felt dirty and was always self conscious that i might smell			0
' after her diagnosis , @entity1 was left in despair and was desperate to find a cure , but the only option she found was @entity53			2
' i did n’t know of any other treatment so decided to give a try , ' she says			2
' it was effective short - term but i had to continue going back and spending money because i needed around three sessions a year			0
it was also very painful and i would dread the thought of the next appointment being round the corner			0
' @entity1 continued with the treatment , but was desperate for a more permanent solution			1
eventually , after two and a half years of enduring @entity53 , @entity1 's online research uncovered @entity66 - a non-invasive and permanent solution to hyperhidrosis newly available in the @entity70			1
the treatment , works by delivering precisely controlled electromagnetic energy using a handheld device to kill underarm sweat glands			1
while the sweat glands are being eliminated through electromagnetic technology , the top layers of the skin are simultaneously cooled and protected			1
dermatologist and founder of the @entity81 , dr @entity82 , pioneered the treatment in the @entity70 and explains , ' @entity66 works by delivering energy to the underarm sweat glands , whichheats and destroys them eliminating them permanently			1
' say goodbye to sweaty armpits : new @entity66 treatment offers a permanent solution to sufferers of excessive perspiration the procedure usually lasts one hour and a second procedure is normally recommended around 3 months later to create permanent results			1
after talking through the treatment carefully with dr @entity82 , @entity1 booked herself in for the £ 3,000 treatment			1
' when i worked out the cost in terms of having a permanent solution to my condition , it seemed like a no - brainer			0
i would ultimately end up saving money in comparison to continuous @entity53 for the rest of my life			0
' plus i could not put a value on the effect it would have on my self esteem and confidence			0
' ' the treatment started with a small numbing injection before the machine head was placed under my armpit and put to work			0
there was a bit of swelling for a day or so after my treatment , but no pain			0
' the real test came when @entity1 was due for her next hospital shift on the monday			2
i wore my scrubs all day but not a drop of sweat could be seen , ' she says			0
not only was @entity1 able to ditch the deodorant , she also experienced an unexpected but welcome side effect			2
' i have also noticed a dramatic reduction in underarm hair , ' she explains			0
@entity1 is due to go back for a follow up treatment in a few weeks but is already feeling underarm confident			1
