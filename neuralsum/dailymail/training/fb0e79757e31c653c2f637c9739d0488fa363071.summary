@entity2 ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity0 raised the issue with @entity5 government ministers in @entity6 this week @entity7 is handing out £ 600,000 every week in child benefits to @entity10 immigrants whose children live abroad			1
the most recent figures show that 20,400 families received payments for a total of 34,268 children , setting back taxpayers £ 31million a year – or some £ 600,000 every week			1
a detailed breakdown of the figures revealed that nearly two - thirds of the children are in @entity22 , with payments for 22,093 youngsters going to the eastern @entity10 country			1
of the rest , 1,231 families in @entity27 get cash for 2,505 children , while 1,215 families in @entity32 , 797 in @entity33 and 789 in @entity5 also benefit			1
children living abroad receive the same amount of money as those in the @entity7 – even if they have never set foot here – despite the cost of living being much lower in many other countries			1
migrants working here claim the @entity7 money rather than use equivalent schemes at home as the handouts are much more generous			1
parents receive £ 20.50 a week for their first child and £ 13.55 for any further children in @entity7			1
by contrast , the @entity22 government pays out £ 13.60 a week for children under five , £ 18.20 for children aged 5 - 18 and £ 19.60 for those aged 18 - 24 in education			1
the figures were uncovered by @entity2 – who accused @entity60 of ‘ giving up ’ on reform to @entity63 benefit rules and attacking the payment of child benefit abroad as ‘ unfair and not affordable ’			2
@entity2 ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity0 raised the issue with @entity5 government ministers in @entity6 this week			0
she said : ‘ @entity60 ’s government seems to have given up any effort to end the scandal of millions of pounds of child benefit being sent abroad every year			0
‘ rather than admitting defeat the prime minister should be ordering his ministers to work with governments across the @entity63 to bear down on this abuse of our benefits system			0
‘ people who work hard and pay in to the social security system are right to be angry when they see child benefit being sent abroad			0
‘ it ’s unfair and it ’s not affordable			0
that ’s why i have raised this important issue with @entity5 government ministers this week			0
if the @entity89 - led government continues to fail to act over millions in child benefit being sent abroad each year , a @entity2 government will			2
’ miss @entity0 will also meet a series of ministers from other @entity63 countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘ abuse ’ of the child benefit system miss @entity0 will also meet a series of ministers from other @entity63 countries to argue for an end to what she called ‘ abuse ’ of the child benefit system			0
earlier this year @entity60 admitted changes to the rules will have to wait until after the 2015 election			0
he said : ‘ today if you travel and work from another @entity10 country into @entity7 , you can then claim child benefit and other benefits for your family back at home even though actually they ’re not living in the @entity7 and going to @entity7 schools and all the rest of it			1
‘ and under the current rules , it seems extremely difficult , if not impossible , to change that			0
‘ now i have n’t met anybody who thinks this is sensible … so that is again a really big change			0
’ however , when in opposition , the @entity122 pledged to change the rules so the controversial payments would cease			0
the party ’s then @entity127 spokesman @entity126 said : ‘ it beggars belief that @entity130 is continuing to send millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money to children who do n’t even live in this country			2
’ the number of families claiming benefits for children living abroad has fallen slightly in the past two years by 3,682			2
but recent changes to child benefit rules mean that families in @entity7 where one parent earns more than £ 60,000 a year do not receive any child benefit , and the money is cut on a sliding scale for those earning between £ 50,000 and £ 60,000			1
a @entity127 spokesman said : ‘ as the prime minister has made clear , we need to change the rules around paying child benefit in respect of children who live in other @entity10 countries			2
' we need a change of @entity63 law to do this , which is why the government is pursuing renegotiation of the relevant @entity63 rules with our @entity10 counterparts			2
