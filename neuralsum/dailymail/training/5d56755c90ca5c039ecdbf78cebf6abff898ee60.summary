by @entity0 published : 14:17 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 14:34 est , 16 may 2012 guilt : @entity2 was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity former @entity6 president @entity2 begged for leniency ahead of his sentencing for a catalogue of brutal war crimes saying he has sympathy for @entity12 ’s civil war			1
@entity2 was found guilty of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including murder , rape , and conscripting child soldiers , during a landmark ruling by judges at the @entity22 - backed @entity21 in april			1
he asked judges at the @entity24 to render their sentence against him in a spirit of ‘ reconciliation , not retribution ’			0
however , he stopped short of admitting any wrongdoing , apologizing for his actions , or expressing remorse			0
prosecutors said there was no reason for leniency , given the extreme nature of the crimes , @entity2 's ‘ greed ’ and misuse of his position of power			1
‘ the purposely cruel and savage crimes committed included public executions and amputations of civilians , the display of decapitated heads at checkpoints , the killing and public disembowelment of a civilian whose intestines were then stretched across the road to make a check point , public rapes of women and girls , and people burned alive in their homes , ’ wrote prosecutor @entity43 in a pre-hearing brief			1
the court found his aid was essential in helping rebels in @entity12 continue their bloody rampage during the @entity70 nation 's decade - long civil war , which ended in 2002 with more than 50,000 dead			1
it was the first time a former head of state had been convicted of war crimes since the aftermath of @entity75 attacked : victims of the brutal crimes committed during the @entity12 civil war nurse their wounds crimes : @entity2 was found guilty of conscripting child soldiers during the decade - long @entity12 civil war child soldier : youngsters were forced into the army during @entity6 's violent civil war , where women were held as sex slaves and civilians had limbs hacked off with machetes innocent victim : a young girl , who has had both of her hands amputated , rests at a camp for amputees and wounded from @entity12 's civil war @entity2 is due to be sentenced on may 30 , with prosecutors demanding an 80 - year prison term , and defence lawyers arguing he should at least be given a sentence that leaves him some hope for life after release			1
‘ i express my sadness and deepest sympathy for the atrocities and crimes that were suffered by individuals and families in @entity12 , ’ @entity2 said			2
he insisted his actions had actually been done to help stabilize the region and claimed he never knowingly assisted in the commission of crimes			0
‘ what i did ... was done with honour , ’ he said			0
‘ i was convinced that unless there was peace in @entity12 , @entity6 would not be able to move forward			2
’ chaos : the decade - long civil war saw tens of thousands of people killed and many more horrifically mutilated during the bloody conflict bloody : a soldier loyal to @entity2 keeps watch on the streets of @entity127 during fighting judges found @entity2 helped the rebels obtain weapons in full knowledge they would likely be used to commit terrible crimes , in exchange for payments of ‘ blood diamonds ’ often obtained by slave labor			1
defence attorney @entity137 argued for a sentence that reflects @entity2 's indirect role : he was found guilty only of aiding the rebels , not leading them , as prosecutors originally charged			2
he said @entity2 's conviction has been ‘ trumpeted ... as sending an unequivocal message to world leaders that holding office confers no immunity ’ from war crimes prosecution			1
' but the reality is that while many @entity150 countries have funded militias that have committed atrocities , no @entity150 leader has ever been indicted by a war crimes tribunal , he said			2
real prize : miners from @entity12 wash gravel in large sieves looking for rough diamonds country 's gems : diamonds from @entity164 town in eastern @entity12 , which sparked horrifying civil war that would later inspire the film @entity166 the lesson is ‘ if you are a small , weak nation , you may be subject to the full force of international law , whereas if you run a powerful nation you have nothing to fear , ’ @entity137 said			2
@entity2 added that once @entity174 and the @entity175 decided they wanted him out of power , his conviction was a foregone conclusion			0
‘ the conspiracy was born , all systems put into motion , and here i stand today , ’ he said			0
‘ i never stood a chance			0
’ leaked @entity184 diplomatic cables admitted into evidence appeared to show the @entity175 government hoped @entity2 would never return to power , but the cables did not prevent his conviction			0
judgement day : judges @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 , rear row from left to right , will sentence @entity2 on may 30 @entity137 said the 80 year sentencing demand is ‘ manifestly disproportionate and excessive ’ for @entity2 , who is 64			0
in court , @entity196 scoffed at that			0
she said @entity2 's involvement in the crimes was ‘ more pervasive than that of the most senior leaders ’ of the @entity12 rebels who have already been sentenced			1
the longest sentence so far , 52 years , was handed down to rebel leader @entity206 , who testified on @entity2 's behalf in 2010			2
@entity2 fled into exile in @entity209 after being indicted by the court in 2003 and was n't arrested for three years			0
while the @entity12 court is formally based in that country 's capital , @entity2 's trial is being staged in @entity215 , a suburb of @entity24 , @entity216 , for fear holding it in @entity70 could destabilize the region .			1

@entity2 's aid to rebels in decade - long @entity12 civil war contributed to horrific violence against civilians
