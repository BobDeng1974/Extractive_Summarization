by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:23 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 17 september 2013 @entity2 issued a blunt warning to @entity4 today that the @entity5 can not claim credit for the government ’s biggest tax cut			1
the @entity10 leader revealed his fury that the @entity12 have produced a poster claiming the ‘ tax cut for 25 million ’ as their own			1
mr @entity2 , who earlier showed off his skills playing table tennis , vowed to bat away any attempts by the @entity5 to steal a policy which they had warned was unaffordable			1
backhand : @entity2 , who tried his hand at table tennis today , hit back at @entity5 trying to claim the income tax policy was theirs parliamentary ping pong : mr @entity2 played against @entity27 , 14 , at @entity28 with members of @entity31 club the @entity10 manifesto promised that ‘ you will not have to pay any income tax on the ﬁrst £ 10,000 you earn ’			1
during the tv leader ’s debates before the general election , mr @entity4 told mr @entity2 : ‘ i would love to take everyone out of their first £ 10,000 of income tax , @entity2 ... we can not afford it			1
’ but during coalition negotiations , mr @entity2 insisted on the policy being implemented and it will have been delivered in full by next april , making everyone £ 700 better off			1
a poster produced for the @entity12 later this month lists policies which the party says are ‘ for hardworking people ’			1
alongside reducing the deficit , crime and immigration , it also boasts of ‘ a tax cut for 25 million people ’			2
swipe : this @entity12 poster suggested the tax cut was a @entity12 policy speaking at the @entity10 conference in @entity61 , mr @entity2 told delegates they had to be vigilant to the threat of @entity5 stealing their policies			1
he said : ‘ i saw on the news this afternoon that the @entity12 , when explaining what their top message is for their conference the week after next , ( said ) it 's raising the income tax allowance , " said mr @entity2			1
‘ that was our manifesto commitment			0
it was not the @entity12 ' commitment			0
@entity4 told me - and you can look it up on @entity80 - in one of the leader 's debates in front of millions of people , he said it ca n't be done			2
‘ we did it , not them			0
we must never , ever , ever allow the great progressive reforms that we are introducing in this government to be appropriated by others			0
’ taking part in a q&a session , mr @entity2 suggested the @entity10 will go into the next election promising to protect the @entity96 and schools budgets from further cuts			2
the deputy prime minister said retaining the ring - fencing as fresh cuts were made to public spending would be an expression of @entity10 values			0
the party would suffer at the polls if it was seen to be merely a ' passive recipient ' of tough @entity12 fiscal discipline			0
anger : mr @entity2 told delegates at the @entity10 conference in @entity61 that they had to protect their policies from being stolen mr @entity2 said he had fought after the last election for schools budgets to be given the same protection as the health service			2
' we have done that between 2010 and 2015 , " he said			0
' my personal view , and we will have to discuss it , but my personal view is we should do that again for 2015 to 2020			0
' and make sure that one of the bedrocks of our approach , our @entity10 approach , is that as we continue to make savings , as we clear the decks up to 2018 , we do not make savings in the schools budget and the @entity96 budget - which i do not think is consistent with our views			0
' it is also increasingly likely that the @entity10 would insist in any future coalition that a mansion tax would be introduced to ensure that anyone on the minimum wage paid no income tax .			0

@entity10 promised workers would pay no tax on first £ 10,000 of earnings
