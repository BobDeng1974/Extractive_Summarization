by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 11:58 est , 14 january 2014 a cash - strapped council has launched a cut - price bid to stop sand being blown away from a popular beach - by covering it with @entity9 trees			1
officials at @entity11 came up with the festive solution after locals complained @entity14 was being eroded by high winds			1
the authority asked residents to donate their old trees then planted them in several rows across the dunes			2
parish councillor @entity21 helps plant @entity9 trees on the beach to try and stabilize the sand dunes which have been blown away dozens of @entity9 trees have been buried on a @entity28 beach in a scheme to prevent erosion they say the pines will act as a temporary wind break and provide shelter which will allow marram grass to grow across the sand			1
grass roots will then bind the dunes together and the trees will eventually be removed			2
the council has attempted to manage the dunes in the past by putting up fencing and pathways but says @entity9 trees provide a cheap , environmentally friendly alternative			1
councillor @entity45 said : ' the dunes are an important part of the beach environment providing coastal defences and a habitat for a variety of insects , small mammals and birds			2
the project , which has met strong opposition from @entity57 , aims to capture the wind to allow the marram grass to grow and hold the sand togethe @entity11 , which launched the tree planning , said residents would see a difference within a year as the sand dunes took shape the council has attempted to manage the dunes in the past by putting up fencing and pathways but says @entity9 trees provide a cheap , environmentally friendly solution ' they are also used by many people for a range of recreational activities and while it 's fantastic to see the area is well used and appreciated , unfortunately , over time , these activities have damaged the dune			1
' a sustainable way of protecting the dune is to use natural materials to limit sand movement and we hope the trees will be the first step in stabilising the area			0
' the plan has split opinion in the coastal village , where residents say the winds whip up sand storms and damage their homes			0
@entity93 with his christmas tree which he bought fifty miles from @entity95 to help reclaim the sand dunes at @entity14 volunteers help plant @entity9 trees on the beach at @entity14 on the @entity101 coast @entity102 , local businessman and a member of the @entity104 , dismissed it as a ' crack - pot idea ' and called for proper investment in sand defences			1
he said : ' we have toyed with this issue for years and we have seen the sand dunes get out of control			0
' consequently there is no sand on the beach as it has spread on to the green and the road			0
' due to a @entity120 directive , much of the sand blown on to the nearby green and road has to been taken to a landfill site rather than being returned to the beach			0
' the beach is literally being carried away and dumped inland , and this tree burying idea is just another crack - pot idea from the council			0
