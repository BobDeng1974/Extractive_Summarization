it represents a unique and quite eye - opening twist on the old ‘ show us your medals ’ game so beloved in professional football			1
while @entity9 as a club have had five trophy triumphs to celebrate across 106 years , their current manager , @entity7 , boasts 10 winners ’ gongs from just a decade of service at @entity15			1
those starkly contrasting totals serve to drive home to @entity7 just how fleeting it is for teams outwith @entity20 and @entity15 to lift silverware			1
@entity7 insists his @entity9 side must make amends for last term 's @entity25 anguish and as he prepares his @entity9 side to face holders @entity29 in today ’s @entity25 semi-final , it also serves to imbue the highly - decorated 41 - year - old with fresh desire to avenge the crushing low of last season ’s 2 - 0 @entity33 loss to @entity35			1
at @entity38 , @entity7 ’s band of talented youngsters wilted in the may heat , blowing their big chance to capture the trophy for just the third time in @entity44 history			1
for the @entity9 boss , the regrets remain			1
but he wants his side to make amends by seizing the day against the @entity29 this afternoon and moving one step closer to the @entity53 club ’s first @entity25 success since 1980			1
@entity7 is happy the @entity20 vs @entity15 has taken the top billing for the @entity25 semi-final ‘ the chance to win trophies does n’t come around all that often , so you need to grasp it , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ but last season , after @entity15 had been knocked out of the @entity33 , we did n’t manage to do that			1
‘ @entity65 football has changed a lot in the last four or five years and the gulf is n’t as big as it possibly should have been			2
the gap is still there in terms of budgets but , when it comes to quality , it ’s not as big as it should be			2
so it was a real chance for us last season			0
‘ could i have done anything differently ? yes , you would n’t be human if you did n’t make mistakes			1
‘ i make mistakes every day and so do players			2
i ’m always learning and i learned from last season			0
disappointments makes you stronger and hopefully good things will come from it			0
‘ but , to be honest , i tend not to look at the past			0
as a player , i won finals and lost finals			0
and , when you win , it ’s all about winning the next one			0
when you lose , it ’s about going again			0
@entity9 are looking to reach the @entity33 final again and do themselves justice on the day ‘ for me , we did well to reach the @entity33 final but just did n’t do ourselves justice on the day			1
so the important thing for us is to get back there – and not leave anything behind this time			0
’ @entity7 does not wholly subscribe to the view that the fall of @entity20 represents a limited window of opportunity for clubs like @entity9			1
the theory goes that the @entity101 club – as unlikely as it seems in these present times - will one day get their act together off the park , making it more unlikely for trophies to end up at @entity44			0
for the @entity9 boss – who has a track record of unearthing low - cost gems like @entity111 and @entity112 – it depends on how you manage your resources			1
‘ whether it ’s a window of opportunity remains to be seen , ’ he said			2
‘ it all depends on what happens there and at @entity15 , as well			1
@entity20 still have a budget that dwarves ours – and @entity29 ’s , as well			1
so i do n’t see that as a given			0
‘ if you look at when we beat @entity20 in the @entity33 semi-final last year , they dwarfed our budget then			2
‘ we were playing kids like @entity131 and @entity132 , who we ’d brought through the youth system			0
it ’s about how you use the resources , and about having a structure in place for the future			0
’ @entity7 proves a touch sheepish when recalling his first @entity25 win with @entity15			1
@entity141 is looking to guide @entity9 to @entity142 with a win against @entity29 ‘ it was against @entity9 at @entity101 ( in 1997 ) , ’ he said			1
but he was more forthcoming about his love of playing at @entity142 during his career , especially scoring the opener in a 3 - 0 @entity33 final win over @entity149			2
and he urged his players to fulfil their dreams at the national stadium against an @entity29 side he considers favourites			1
‘ i loved playing at @entity142 , ’ he continued			2
‘ as a kid , you dream of playing here and scoring in finals			0
i was fortunate enough to do it at @entity15 and there ’s no better feeling			1
i want my players to live the moments i had as a player			0
i ’m effectively like a schoolteacher passing on bits of wisdom and belief			0
‘ i ’m sure that every kid still dreams of playing and scoring at @entity142 in a cup final , never mind a semi			2
so the big thing for us on saturday is to get the win which will take us to the final			2
@entity177 looks ahead to his side 's crucial cup clash against @entity29 ‘ i think @entity29 go into it as favourites because they won it last year and they have a bit more experience in their squad – guys like @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 , who have been at @entity15			1
‘ we only have one or two who have the experience of winning trophies			0
it will be about getting them to settle down , not think about the occasion too much and just to play their normal game			0
’ @entity7 is happy the @entity20 v @entity15 match tomorrow has taken top billing over today ’s encounter which is likelier to be a better , closer contest			1
‘ not at all , ’ he said when asked about whether it bothered him			2
‘ when the draw was made , no one spoke about our game because the @entity206 have not played for a few seasons			0
‘ if anything , it has made our game a bit more low key , which is fine			0
the players are not as nervous about it as much			0
i ’ll probably watch the other game in the house on sunday			0
it is probably better to stay out the way			0
’ nor is @entity7 worried about the prospect of @entity9 fans being outnumbered by up to three to one at @entity142			1
‘ @entity29 have fantastic backing , they ’re a one team city and they won the cup last year , ’ he said			1
‘ it ’s a bit less for us because we have two teams in the city			0
‘ but we will still have a healthy crowd coming down			0
hopefully we can send them back up the road happy and then we will have even greater numbers for the final			2
