a young woman suffering excruciating stomach pains diagnosed herself with ovarian cancer using @entity3			1
by the time the @entity5 's disease was discovered , a tumour growing on her ovary had reached the size of a melon			2
until then , the 22 - year - old had been told her agonising stomach pain and constipation were caused by irritable bowel syndrome ( @entity15 )			1
as her pain became unbearable mrs @entity16 turned to the internet to search for answers			1
she discovered her symptoms met almost all the key signs of advanced ovarian cancer			1
doctors operated , right , in january last year - but discovered there was nothing they could do but after returning home to be told by doctors she was suffering @entity15 , she did her own research when her pain became unbearable			1
she discovered she had most of the signs of ovarian cancer			1
after she requested more tests doctors discovered a tumour the size of a melon in her stomach after requesting more tests doctors diagnosed her with stage four ovarian cancer in september 2013			1
in january last year doctors performed an exploratory operation but discovered they could not remove the growth , because it had attached itself to her internal organs			2
the advanced cancer had spread to her small bowel , liver , diaphragm , heart and lungs			1
mrs @entity16 has now been told she has between one and two years to live			1
but the positive 23 - year - old has responded well to chemotherapy , which has shrunk the tumour			1
in june last year , mrs @entity16 's then boyfriend @entity29 got down on one knee to propose			1
the couple , who met at university , married surrounded by friends and their families the next month			0
mrs @entity16 , from @entity70 , @entity71 , said : ' the trouble i had was that ovarian cancer is very rare in people under 50 , and the type i have is even more rare , so i do n't think it was ever even something that was considered			1
' still , when my problems seemed to get worse , i remember looking online and saw i had eight out of the nine symptoms of ovarian cancer			1
' i asked my mum what she thought and , like any friend or mum would say to reassure you , she said " do n't be silly , you do n't have cancer "			2
' but i knew my body and i could tell something was n't right			0
i 'm a very happy person and i 'm determined to stay that way			0
' when my doctor gave me the diagnosis , he said : " i 'm really sorry , you 're such a positive person "			0
' @entity29 has been amazing throughout all this			2
when he proposed i burst into tears because i could n't face leaving him behind			0
six months after first going to the doctors mrs @entity16 was told her cancer was terminal			1
in july last year she and @entity29 tied the knot , after he got down on one knee to propose in the june mrs @entity16 , from @entity70 in @entity71 , said she burst into tears when her husband proposed because she could n't bear the thought of leaving him behind the signs of ovarian cancer are not easy to spot and can be vague			1
they can just about all be attributed to another less serious condition , particularly where the disease is less advanced			0
many women suffering the very early stages of ovarian cancer , stage one , wo n't have any symptoms at all			1
if they do notice changes , they are most likely to suffer pain in the lower abdomen or side , and bloating , or a full feeling in the abdomen			2
by the time ovarian cancer has spread outside the ovaries ( stages two and three ) , the symptoms include : when the cancer spreads to a distant body organ , for example the lungs , it is classed as being stage four ovarian cancer			1
symptoms in this late stage include : source : @entity133 ' but the wedding was the best day of my life and he 's helped me through so many struggles , including losing my hair			0
' he would tell me my bald head was beautiful			0
' mrs @entity16 first began suffering with stomach pains and constipation when she went travelling with her now husband , who is also 23			1
they spent six months in the @entity30 outback after graduating from the @entity147			0
initially , mrs @entity16 put the symptoms down to a change in her diet and new surroundings			1
but her health continued to deteriorate , despite all her blood tests and scans coming back clear			0
and it was n't until the couple returned to the @entity157 in may 2013 that she went to see her gp - by which time she had not been to the toilet for five weeks			0
she was told it was @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and prescribed laxatives			2
over the next four months , while in constant agony , mrs @entity16 returned to the surgery five times			2
her pain became so unbearable she would double over in agony and could only stand for a few minutes			2
she said : ' when my symptoms began in @entity30 , i put it down to the water or the change in diet			2
' but it was getting worse and worse and i was feeling so awful			0
' i had two ultrasounds and some blood tests but nothing was picked up			0
' by the time i flew home to the @entity157 , i had n't been to the toilet in five weeks			0
' my mum said i looked really ill and took me to the doctors that day , but they just put me on laxatives			2
' in the end i said to my gp : " i 'm not leaving here until you look at me and tell me i need to go to hospital "			0
doctors told mrs @entity16 she has between a year and two years to live			1
by the time her disease was detected it had already spread to her liver , bowel , heart and lungs			2
despite her terminal diagnosis , the now 23 - year - old is determined to remain positive ' i could n't take any more , i felt horrific and i could n't even go to the supermarket without needing to sit down after five minutes because i was in so much agony			1
' i had really bad pain in my stomach and when the doctors finally said it could be ovarian or bowel cancer , i thought it all made sense			1
' i should have said to my doctor " i think this is what i 've got , do something about it , " but there 's no point on dwelling on what i could have done			0
' mrs @entity16 is being treated at the @entity212 and responded well to weekly chemotherapy , which successfully shrank the tumour			1
but when it stopped working in september , she was put on a clinical trial with monthly sessions			0
the 23 - year - old said she wants to share her story to encourage young people to be more persistent with doctors , and to raise awareness			1
she said : ' i 've met lots of young people aged 24 and under with cancer on my journey and there 's a massive problem with young people being diagnosed in later stages because doctors do n't believe it could be cancer			2
' i 'd absolutely urge people to go the doctors and be persistent			0
' when you know something 's really wrong with your body you know and you need to make the doctor believe it			0
' her husband @entity29 , who now works one day a week at a supermarket and devotes the rest of his time to his wife , has been by her side throughout			2
the pair have been determined to make the most of their time together by enjoying as many days out and memorable experiences as possible			0
he said : ' @entity16 is quite simply the most amazing young lady i have ever met in my life			2
she has now urged other young people who fear something is wrong to push doctors for a diagnosis mr and mrs @entity16 have raised more than £ 35,000 for the gynaecological unit at the @entity212 , where she is undergoing treatment ' through everything she has gone through , she never moans and always finds a positive no matter how bad things are			1
' i 'm the luckiest man in the world - firstly to have met her , but now being married to her means the world to me			0
' we make the most of every minute together and take each day as it comes			0
' we have no idea how long we have left together so for us , so all we can do is enjoy each other 's company and make the most of it			0
