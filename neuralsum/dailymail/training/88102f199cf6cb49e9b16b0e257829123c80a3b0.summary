by @entity0 published : 06:59 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 1 april 2013 in the sitting room of @entity2 and @entity4 ’s home , the black and white photograph on the right takes pride of place			1
it shows the couple as teenage sweethearts , cuddled up in a photobooth during a charabanc outing to the seaside at @entity15 , @entity16 , in 1950			2
you would naturally assume that @entity2 , now 78 , and @entity4 , 79 , had been together ever since			1
devoted : @entity2 and @entity4 first met as teenagers but her father refused to allow them to marry first love : @entity2 and @entity21 met aged 16 and 17 but were n't able to marry until their 70s n fact , they married only two years ago – after spending six decades apart			1
the first part of their love story ended in heartbreak , after @entity2 ’s father ruled that , at 18 and 19 , they were too young to get married			1
both went on to enjoy happy marriages , have children , celebrate their golden weddings and become grandparents			0
but they never forgot each other – and @entity2 always treasured that photobooth snap , even asking her sister to look after it in case her husband asked her to destroy it			1
six decades later , after both were widowed , @entity2 and @entity4 met again through a mutual friend			1
they realised they still wanted to be together and , with nothing now to stop them , finally got married			1
yesterday @entity2 said : ‘ it ’s as though we ’ve never been apart			2
as well as loving each other , we are good companions , just like when we first met			2
in fact , we are just like an old married couple			2
’ the couple grew up in @entity56 , @entity57			0
they met in 1950 after @entity4 , 17 , noticed @entity59 , then 16 , walking down the street with her sister @entity61 , whose boyfriend was a friend of his			1
‘ i saw her and i was smitten , ’ said @entity4			0
‘ i waited for them to come out of @entity61 ’s boyfriend ’s house and come back up the road			0
‘ i got a pair of garden shears and pretended to cut the hedge outside my parents ’ house			0
when they passed , i said , “ @entity74 , who ’s that with you ? ” and we got talking			0
’ shortly afterwards , @entity4 enlisted in the @entity79 and was stationed at @entity80 in @entity81			0
@entity2 , an aspiring tap dancer , worked for the gas board and performed in pantomimes			2
eventually @entity4 wrote to @entity2 and asked her out on their first date			2
after that they wrote to each other every day			0
happy : the couple are enjoying a contented retirement together in the @entity92 town of @entity93 long lasting love : according to @entity4 , anyone who says they 've forgotten their first love is fibbing two years later they decided to become engaged , but @entity2 ’s widowed father said they were too young			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i thought @entity2 ’s father was wrong , but i did n’t propose			1
somehow , we just parted after that			0
it was my fault , i just went my own way			0
’ in 1956 , @entity2 married @entity106			1
they had a son and a daughter and ran a hotel in @entity93 , @entity92			0
meanwhile @entity4 got married , to @entity111 , in 1957			0
the couple had three sons and were together for 53 years until @entity111 died in 2010			0
@entity2 and @entity4 did not see or speak to each other after they split , but a friend of @entity4 ’s used to stay at @entity2 ’s hotel and she would always ask how @entity4 was			2
after the friend told @entity2 about @entity4 ’s bereavement they picked up the phone and spoke again for the first time in six decades			1
a year later , @entity4 plucked up the courage to ask @entity2 to visit him at his home in @entity123 , @entity57			1
eventually , with the approval of both families , @entity4 moved in with @entity2 in @entity93 , and on december 6 , 2011 , they married			1
@entity4 said : ‘ we both often wondered about what might have happened if things had worked out differently			0
but we do n’t dwell on it now			0
we are both reasonably fit and healthy for our ages and are looking forward not backward			0
’ at last ! after 60 years apart , the couple finally married in @entity132 this year with family and friends around them			1

@entity2 and @entity21 met aged 16 and 17
the pair wanted to marry in 1950 but her father refused
both married other *people* but were widowed at the same time
they finally married aged 78 and 79 in @entity132 this year
