dr @entity0 has produced a mathematical formula that will guarantee the perfect tennis serve , first time and every time a maths professor has created an equation that he claims is key to the ' perfect ' tennis serve - a fast , flat serve that hits the same spot every time , but with unpredictable top spin			1
dr @entity0 has produced a mathematical formula that will guarantee the perfect tennis serve , first time and every time			1
but although he knows what the players need to produce in maths terms , he has no plans to replace their coaches			1
dr @entity0 , a lecturer in applied mathematics at @entity20 , said : ‘ i was given a question about what is the perfect tennis serve so i thought about how professional tennis players win games			1
‘ a fast tennis serve is great , if you have a fast serve that 's wonderful but if you keep doing the same serve over and over again your opponents will be able to respond to it			1
‘ you need to put some degree of uncertainty into it whilst still having control			0
’ players use spin to create that uncertainty , adding either top spin or side spin to their serve , he said			1
he said that spin changes the trajectory of the ball through the air , something called the ‘ @entity44 ’			2
varying degrees of spin either pull the ball down to the ground faster , giving a higher bounce , or cause it to curve			2
according to dr @entity0 , a typical player can spin the ball at 2,000 - 2,500 revolutions per minute			2
and despite a difference in service speeds between men and women , their spin rates are often similar			2
he said he has calculated an equation that will help players serve a ball into the same spot of the service box as if they played a fast flat serve - but with topspin			1
‘ you want to add this uncertainty of spin , but you want to put the ball in the same place , ’ he said			2
@entity73 in action during his win over @entity76 ‘ you want the ball to go in the far corner of the service box but you want spin on it			0
‘ the equation does n't tell you how you should move the racquet , it tells you how the ball should be moving when it leaves the racquet			0
‘ it gives you a nice relationship between the speed you hit the ball at , the spin you put on it , and the angle you aim it up and down			0
‘ it tells you which way the ball goes and how			0
’ the equation relates to serve speed , height of the ball when it is hit , and the ball 's angle of elevation as it leaves the racket , along with the top spin in revolutions per second			1
other fixed parameters are the horizontal distance the ball has to cover , around 18 - 19 metres , the impact of aerodynamic drag per metre travelled , and the @entity44 force effect			0
dr @entity0 said the formula shows how putting top spin on the ball reduces the left - hand side of the equation so the player has to alter the serve in another way to rebalance it			1
serving with top spin must be compensated for , he said , either by stretching the height of the serve , increasing the speed , or slightly increasing the elevation angle			1
but he said despite finding the mathematical formula , he does not plan on replacing tennis coaches			0
‘ i 'm not aiming to replace tennis coaches , because they can tell you exactly how to do this			0
‘ i 've not modelled what the racquet should be doing , just the ball , so i wo n't be starting to give tennis lessons any time soon			0
’ dr @entity0 worked with @entity134 and @entity135 on the equation as part of a series of activities to celebrate the launch of the new @entity142 series .			0
