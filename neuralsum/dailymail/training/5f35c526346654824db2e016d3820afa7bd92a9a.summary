since @entity1 disappeared from our screens in february in a flurry of betrayal , dead bodies and elaborate plot twists , it 's been a frustrating time for fans of @entity10			1
what was in the files that @entity14 detective @entity13 saw that related to the childhood of his blunt - speaking @entity16 colleague @entity1 ? is @entity13 himself guilty of murder ? and does the temperature ever rise above freezing in this corner of @entity22 ? @entity22 drama @entity1 takes its name from the five - mile bridge across the @entity26 , linking @entity27 in @entity14 and @entity28 in @entity16 the good news is that we wo n't have to wait too much longer to find out			1
filming for a third series of the @entity33 hit is under way , so there was only one thing to do - head to the scene of the crime			1
the drama takes its name from the five - mile bridge across the @entity26 , linking @entity27 and @entity28			1
in the first series , a body is found at the point on the bridge where @entity14 and @entity16 meet , which is why detectives from both countries are brought together to solve the case			1
our base for the night is a 1960s motel , the @entity50 , just outside @entity28 - it 's where @entity13 stays when his wife kicks him out after discovering he has been unfaithful			1
those who sign up to @entity1 tour visit the @entity27 's colourful harbour of @entity55 in @entity1 , it 's a symphony of misery , augmented by depressing decor , despair and @entity13 's haunting visions in the subterranean swimming pool			1
in reality , it 's a clever , chic budget hotel , filled with thoughtful @entity10 furniture and views of the forest			2
in the morning , happy families tuck into a generous breakfast buffet before heading out into the sunshine			0
@entity33 drama @entity70 was adapted from the @entity16 novelist @entity72 's @entity70 novels once in @entity27 , visitors on the tour are able to visit popular tourist sights such as the @entity77 by and large , there 's a lot of rain , snow and sleet in @entity1 , and the drama certainly does n't showcase the architecture of the two cities			1
this is mostly by design , according to scriptwriter @entity88 , when i track him down in @entity28			1
we meet in the @entity92 , a cafe at the end of a pier which is the site of a pivotal scene in the first series when @entity13 realises just who might be responsible for a series of murders			0
over coffee and cinnamon buns , i subject hans to a police - style interrogation			0
what 's happened to cuddly @entity13 ? will @entity108 , his glamorous but decidedly non-cuddly colleague , ever get a boyfriend , or even master the art of small talk ? @entity28 's city centre includes @entity114 , a square filled with half - timbered houses , bars will we be seeing more of @entity108 's vintage mustard - coloured @entity119 and leather trousers ? the next series will apparently be about responsibility and notions of family while also delving into @entity108 's childhood			1
i hoover up the dramatic crumbs as eagerly as i 've been devouring the tasty cinnamon buns			0
then it 's time for a tour designed for @entity1 obsessives			2
we start in @entity28 , a powerhouse during medieval times , when its wealth was built on the herring trade			2
the gorgeous city centre includes @entity114 , a square filled with half - timbered houses , bars and happy @entity16 celebrating the weekend in the early autumn sun. @entity28 is @entity16 's most multi-cultural city , a legacy of its ship - building days			1
that industry may have dwindled away , but now it 's also a showcase of cutting - edge , sustainable architecture , especially the @entity149			0
it 's apparently where @entity108 lives ( alone )			0
our bus takes us past some of the buildings that feature in the second series , including the site of the @entity28 police station that is actually part of a hospital , and has a exterior that 's dark grey / blue			2
' the designer is very into this colour , ' says our guide , as we head off to a street in the same muted palette			0
then it 's time for the highlight - a trip across the bridge itself			2
@entity28 is @entity16 's most multi-cultural city and is a key destination on the tour offered to fans of @entity22 drama , @entity1 there 's a slow incline as we head out from @entity28 , and before we reach the central area we pick up a key bit of information with which we can share with less informed devotees back home : the actual border is a few hundred yards further along , and a simple sign denotes we have now reached @entity14			1
once in @entity27 , we eschew such commonplace tourist sights as the @entity77 and colourful harbour of @entity55 in favour of the modernist architecture of the @entity27 police headquarters and the trendy harbourside building that serves as the home of it entrepreneur @entity195 in series two			2
most of @entity1 is actually filmed along the @entity16 coast in @entity199			1
this cute town - population around 20,000 - regularly sees some of the darkest fictional deeds unfold in its streets			0
most of @entity1 is actually filmed along the @entity16 coast in the town of @entity199 the real police investigate one murder a year here on average , but thanks to @entity72 , the creator of local detective @entity70 , dozens of fictional ones have taken place in its cobbled streets			1
the tourist board has a handy map with blood splashes to denote the area			0
and the body count is set to rise alarmingly			0
from this month , @entity218 will be dusting down his weariest expression to film @entity70 in one studio , with @entity108 striding around in @entity1 in the next one , while both will make regular forays into the @entity199 and @entity28 and nearby countryside for location shoots			1
the locals are pretty blasé about these incursions - many of them have acted as extras and do n't bat an eye at one of the full - scale bollywood film productions that regularly turn up here either			0
the @entity70 industry is kept low - key , largely because @entity72 has refused to allow commercialism			0
a @entity199 cafe that features as the diabetic detective 's favourite tried to introduce a @entity70 cake			2
@entity72 refused , but you can find it today - a family called @entity70 gave the cafe permission to name it after them			0
a conspiracy of sugar , cream and @entity22 baking excellence , it would have been a crime not to experience it			0
double rooms at the @entity50 ( scandichotels.com ) start at £ 75 per night			0
the @entity252 costs around £ 33pp			0
for more information , go to @entity254 / en. return flights to @entity27 from @entity256 with @entity257 ( flysas.co.uk ) start at £ 110pp .			2
