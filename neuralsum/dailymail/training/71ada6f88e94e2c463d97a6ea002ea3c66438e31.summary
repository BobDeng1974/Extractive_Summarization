long before @entity1 and her power brows took the modelling world by storm , there was another member of the @entity7 clan rocking the catwalk			2
@entity9 , 28 , began modelling in 2008 after being spotted by the same model scout as sister @entity1 and has since worked for @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , among others			1
now , the @entity17 brand ambassador has used her fashion expertise to design a range of swimwear - and has modelled everything herself			0
@entity9 , who is also ' @entity32 ' for the @entity33 , was already a fan of the brand and wore the designs during her @entity37 hen weekend at the @entity39 festival			1
speaking to @entity40 about her efforts , which are being sold through @entity42 , she said : ' i was instantly drawn to the suits because they were sexy and fun and you did n't feel uncomfortable in them			2
' i could run around and do cartwheels in them ! ' the pieces are , said the model , designed to reflect her ' active ' lifestyle and come with fun prints , among them flamingo motifs , and bold block colours			2
activewear : @entity9 , who has a busy schedule , says she wanted her designs to reflect that and cater to active women lithe : @entity9 was spotted back in 2008 and has built a huge name for herself in the modelling world ever since , so it was only a matter of time before she turned to designing collaboration : the newlywed 's range for @entity71 & @entity72 came off the back of her wearing and loving the range something for everyone : as well as skimpy bikinis , there 's also plenty of more modest swimsuits in the new range , which is available on @entity42 ' i have an active schedule and life - this is for the active girl , ' she added			1
it has certainly been an active few weeks for the model and muse , who put in a stylish appearance at the @entity93 's 2014 film benefit honouring director @entity91 on monday			0
dressed in a colourful @entity17 dress , the model ensured that all eyes were on her as she arrived at the @entity99 event			0
but one man who was n't there to witness her dramatic dress sense was @entity9 's husband @entity104 , who remained behind in @entity105			0
the pair married six months ago in a lavish two - part wedding , which began in the @entity109 capital and continued in the @entity111 city of @entity112			0
@entity1 , who ? her little sister is focusing more on her acting career in the @entity116 and it looks like @entity9 is getting ready to take her place in the fashion world fun prints : @entity9 wanted the designs to reflect her personality and lifestyle so opted for colourful prints such as this flamingo one party girls : @entity9 was already a fan of the brand and wore the designs at her @entity37 bachelorette weekend at @entity39 with sister @entity1 , left , and @entity130 model and muse : @entity9 was scouted by @entity134 's @entity133 in 2008 and has since worked for @entity17 and @entity13 frowing : ( @entity135 ) @entity137 television presenter @entity136 , model @entity7 , founder of online channel @entity140 , @entity143 entrepreneur @entity142 and @entity144 sit in the front row at @entity146 show			1
