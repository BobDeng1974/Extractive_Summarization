with its white sandy beaches and year - round sunshine , the @entity1 family could n't wait to leave their dreary home in @entity6 to start a new life in @entity8			1
but just two months after making the move of a lifetime , the family - of - three have returned to @entity12 - because of the sky - high price of teabags and the lack of @entity18 's squash in @entity8			1
@entity19 and @entity1 spent £ 10,000 to move with two - year - old daughter @entity20 halfway around the world from their home in @entity6 to @entity25 in september last year			1
home sweet home : @entity19 and @entity1 , pictured with their daughter @entity20 , have returned to the @entity12 just two months after starting a new life in @entity8 move of a lifetime : the @entity31 spent £ 10,000 uprooting their life in @entity6 , pictured left , to start afresh in @entity25 , @entity8 , pictured right but far from experiencing the life of luxury she 'd expected , mrs @entity34 and her family were left shocked at the soaring cost of living in the country - with the final straw coming when she could n’t find her daughter ’s favourite juice in the supermarket			1
having never been to @entity8 and with no family and only few friends living in the country , the idea to move struck mrs @entity34 after watching @entity50 documentary series ‘ @entity53 ’ about @entity51 who have settled in @entity52			1
mrs @entity34 , 35 said : ‘ i ’m really impulsive and i can be quite a bully when i ’ve made my mind up on something but this was a big decision so i left it with @entity1 for a few weeks to think about			1
i did n’t think he ’d say yes			0
i did n’t think he ’d leave his mum			0
‘ it was only when he came back to me and said , i think we should definitely do it , that i started taking it seriously			0
‘ because of my daughter ’s age we said it would be the right time , when she was n’t going to be affected because she was n’t in school or anything			2
’ not living the dream : @entity34 , 35 , said the cost of living in @entity25 , pictured , was sky - high so the couple decided to move over 10,000 miles from the three - bedroom , semi-detached house in @entity6 they had shared for eight years , to start a new life in @entity25			1
mrs @entity34 started looking for a replacement job in recruitment in april while mr @entity1 , 40 , agreed to leave his job as a forklift truck driver and stay at home looking after @entity20 until they were settled down and he could start looking for work himself			1
they booked themselves on to a 32 - hour flight leaving from @entity87 airport on september 3rd , packed their furniture into a shipping crate and let their property to a young family with two children			2
they even sent their eight - year - old @entity95 to have vaccines and get a pet passport			2
when they landed the family checked themselves in to a plush , two - bedroom hotel apartment in the centre of @entity25 , which came with a shared swimming pool , until they found somewhere to rent			2
but the dream quickly unravelled			0
mrs @entity34 continued : ‘ we knew almost straight away that something was n’t right , but we just did n’t say anything to each other			0
big ideas : @entity34 had never been to @entity8 but made the decision to move there after watching the @entity50 documentary series ' @entity53 in @entity114 ' about @entity12 who have moved to @entity52 taking the plunge : @entity1 , pictured left with his daughter @entity20 , gave up his job as a forklift driver to make the move to @entity8 - hoping it would provide a better life for his little girl , pictured right ‘ it just was n’t what we were expecting			1
you think you ’re going to be able to go out there and afford a great quality of life because the wages are all higher , but it ’s also really , really expensive			2
‘ i drink green tea and out there a box of 80 green tea bags can cost £ 8			2
you can spend £ 80 on shopping and only come away with two carrier bags			0
‘ it ’s the little things you miss as well , like not being able to get my daughter ’s favourite juice			1
all they have over there is the thick @entity148 cordial and she likes @entity18 ’s apple and blackcurrant			0
i remember going round the shops and thinking , what are we going to do ? ’ after just two weeks in their new home the pair sat down in their apartment and had a tearful conversation			0
she continued : ‘ one night we were sitting in the apartment and @entity1 got upset and asked if i felt the same way			1
that ’s when we realised we both felt the same but just had n’t wanted to say anything			0
‘ we missed our families more than we thought we would , and talking to them was difficult because of the time difference			0
‘ we said we would go on a bit longer and see how we felt but we both knew from then			0
’ homesick : @entity1 , 40 , and his wife @entity19 found they missed their home comforts and could n't find their daughter 's favourite @entity18 's squash when they reached @entity25 , pictured urgent calls were made to the @entity177 where their furniture was sitting on the dock waiting to be loaded onto a ship			1
the couple asked staff to hold it , before telling mrs @entity34 ’s sister not to put their dog on a plane which would have cost them another £ 4,000			1
they then called the travel agent and booked flights home for the following week , but in their indecision called back twice to delay it			0
‘ we were uneasy about it but we had to make a decision			0
before we left there was no doubt in my mind that it was going to work			0
we thought our daughter was going to grow up @entity8			1
‘ we both looked at each other when we got the airport and thought , are we doing the right thing ? ’ eventually the family ended up living with family in @entity87 by the end of october - just two months after leaving			1
mrs @entity34 continued : ' i do n’t think @entity20 ever realised what was happening , she just got on with it			1
costly move : the @entity211 decided to return to the @entity12 before their pet dog @entity95 , pictured with @entity20 , was sent out to @entity8 to join them - which would have cost them £ 4,000 for the flight alone ‘ we were worried about the amount of flying she ’d have to do but she was always really good and never complained			1
‘ when we tell her about this in a few years she ’ll probably say : “ you did what ? ! ” ’ mrs @entity34 is now working for her former recruitment company in @entity222 , while her husband works shifts driving cargo on and off ships at nearby docks			0
they are sharing a house with her sister while they try and find somewhere new to live			0
she said : ‘ we have always wanted to move to the @entity232 and now seems the perfect time			0
the family renting our old house have offered to buy it and all our things are already in storage			0
' but despite their disastrous first attempt at settling in @entity8 , mrs @entity34 admits she could be tempted to try it again in the future			2
she revealed : ‘ i would go back to @entity8 , to @entity243 or @entity52 or @entity244 , but not to @entity25			2
' on average , the cost of living in @entity8 is significantly higher than in @entity12			1
consumer prices are approximately 22 per cent higher while groceries are 25 per cent higher			0
here 's how every day items in a daily shop compare : @entity250 @entity251 ( 500g ) £ 1.71 £ 1.00 +71.39 % @entity252 ( 1kg ) £ 1.85 £ 1.50 +23.03 % @entity253 ( 12 ) £ 2.46 £ 2.00 +23.03 % local cheese ( 1kg ) £ 6.15 £ 6.00 +2.52 % apples ( 1kg ) £ 2.46 £ 1.66 +48.23 % @entity256 ( 1kg ) £ 1.85 £ 1.60 +15.34 % @entity257 ( mid-range ) £ .9.23 £ 6.00 +53.79 % @entity259 ( 0.5 liter bottle ) £ 2.77 £ 1.68 +65.03 % ( source : www.numbeo.com )			2

@entity19 and @entity1 spent £ 10,000 to start new life in @entity8
but two weeks after the move , the couple decided they 'd made big *mistake*
not being able to buy daughter @entity20 's favourite squash was last straw
couple have returned to @entity12 - just two months after moving to @entity8
