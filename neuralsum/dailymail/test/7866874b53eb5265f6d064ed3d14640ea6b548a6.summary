business leaders have voiced their fears over the ' disastrous @entity3 campaign ' which they believe has been too focussed on ' personal attacks and scaremongering '			1
they expressed concerns over the negative tactics employed by the @entity3 campaign ahead of the general election next month – which they believe have done little to discredit @entity10			1
as it emerged that the @entity14 leader is now the bookies ' favourite to be the next prime minister , a number of business leaders revealed they are worried @entity18 will lose the battle for @entity20			1
and it appears mr @entity18 's advisers have the same fear and have called on campaigners to change tack today			2
pictured : @entity18 in @entity31 today ( left ) and @entity10 campaigning at @entity32 , @entity33 , today business leaders said @entity18 's role in delivering economic growth had become the ' background noise ' of the @entity3 campaign when it should have been the focus the critique comes just weeks after more than 100 of @entity41 's top business leaders backed the @entity43 ' economic plan in what was described as an ' unprecedented move ' urging voters not to risk a ' change of course '			1
in a notable intervention weeks from the election on may 7 , the business chiefs , who run companies with well known retail brands such as @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , signed a better claiming a @entity14 government would ' put the recovery at risk '			2
but now , a number of @entity62 and other business leaders have anonymously criticised mr @entity18 's use of personal attacks on his opposition			0
speaking to the @entity68 on the condition that they would not be named , one chairman said : ' the negative campaign has been disastrous '			0
another added that the successes of the coalition government , including delivering real economic growth and jobs has become the ' background noise ' of the campaign instead of its focus			1
but a @entity3 spokesman insisted that the campaign 's focus on the idea of the @entity84 in a coalition with @entity14 is doing well on the doorstep , according to the @entity68 some argued the campaign 's focus has been too narrow and that ' fear tactics ' could backfire badly			1
' the @entity92 scaremongering plays into the @entity84 's hands , ' said one chief			0
and it appears @entity3 tacticians had believed mr @entity18 's economic record would have delivered a solid poll lead by now			1
the polls put mr @entity18 and mr @entity10 on equal footing – and several business leaders suggest this is a result of the @entity43 underestimating the leader 's appeal to voters			2
as bookies named @entity10 the favourite to be the next prime minister , one business leader said : ' every time @entity10 is visible , he appears credible ' ' every time @entity10 is visible , he appears credible , ' said one			1
' the worst thing is when ( @entity3 ) @entity113 tries to be helpful , ' one conservative candidate told @entity114			2
' on the doorstep , when you speak to voters , very little is changing			0
the campaign has been almost genteel			0
' mr @entity18 helped nurture a recovery that has lifted the economy out of its deepest downturn since @entity123 to give @entity41 one of the fastest growth rates in the developed world			0
@entity127 , @entity18 's @entity128 election guru , has now told the @entity43 to focus on that			0
