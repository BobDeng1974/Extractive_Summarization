if @entity0 is to prolong what appears a doomed existence as @entity4 manager then a first @entity6 derby defeat in 28 years – in which another of his players was sent off and he was mocked by his own fans – will hardly aid his sorry cause			1
the 56 - year - old cut a shocked and lonely figure amid the cauldron of noise that greeted the climax of a pulsating tie which – for 115 seconds – had even threatened the most unlikely reprieve for the under - fire boss			1
that two - minute period was the time between @entity21 ’s 82nd - minute breakthrough for 10 - man @entity4 and @entity24 ’s stunning leveller			1
fast forward another 90 seconds and @entity25 , thanks to @entity28 ’s header , were in front			1
hero : @entity25 forward @entity28 is congratulated after scoring his side 's late second goal @entity25 4 - 4 - 2 : @entity33 6 ; @entity34 7 , @entity35 6 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6 ; @entity38 6 , @entity39 6.5 , @entity40 7.5 , @entity24 7 ( @entity41 97 ) ; @entity42 6 ( @entity43 70 ) , @entity28 6 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 booked : @entity37 goals : @entity24 84 , @entity28 86 @entity4 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity51 6 ; @entity52 6 , @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6.5 ; @entity56 3 , @entity57 6 , @entity58 5 ( @entity59 90 ) , @entity60 5.5 ; @entity21 6 , @entity61 6			1
subs not used : @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 sent off : @entity56 booked : @entity56 , @entity54 goals : @entity21 82 att : 18,750 ref : @entity70 ( @entity71 ) the reward for the @entity74 side – beaten finalists in this competition two years ago – is a trip to @entity78 – conquerors of @entity80 - in four weeks ’ time			1
@entity0 , though , can not look beyond saturday ’s visit of @entity82			2
indeed , he may not make it that far , for owner @entity84 had exited @entity85 even before the late drama and chants of ' you 're getting sacked in the morning ' emanating from the away end			2
in the wake of last weekend ’s 4 - 1 defeat at @entity93 – in which @entity94 and @entity95 were dismissed – there was talk that @entity84 was set to axe the former @entity98 manager just five games into his surprise tenure			2
but @entity0 has hardly been helped by his players ’ indiscipline and @entity56 was red carded after just 31 minutes			1
the midfielder had already tried his damnedest to be sent off for a knee - high lunge on @entity39 before he collected a second yellow for an equally irresponsible challenge on @entity108			2
and @entity0 said : ‘ one player has given us a mountain to climb			2
but we pretty much climbed that mountain			2
‘ the rest of the team were magnificent to a man			2
as the game wore on we got stronger and got our reward with the goal			0
‘ when we scored i was proud of the boys and then thought “ right , how do we kill the game ? ”			0
‘ but sometimes you have to say “ that ’s a great strike ”			0
then we had to steady it down but a couple of lads slipped in the box and their player got the run on them and he ’s scored the winner			0
' ouch : @entity56 was booked for a second time for this challenge on @entity108 marching orders : @entity56 was dismissed in the first half to make @entity4 ' task even harder not exactly eye - to - eye : @entity25 manager @entity138 and @entity4 striker @entity61 come to blows is @entity0 confident , then , he will see the weekend ? ‘ i ’ve got a job to do and the players are behind me , ’ he answered			1
‘ they have come to see me and they ’re desperate to do well for @entity4			1
‘ we ’ve been written off and we ’re making it difficult for ourselves on the pitch with the red cards			0
but the team spirit is there and we have to take this on the chin			0
' it ’s a difficult situation and the sooner we win a game the better			0
‘ but my approach has just been one of determination			0
i ’m a fighter , not a quitter			0
my concern is the team but i just feel things are n’t going their way			0
‘ in the dressing - room they are devastated and we do feel we can turn things around			0
we can not wait for saturday and that is where we are now looking			0
’ head boy : @entity21 looked to have won the game for @entity4 when he headed them in front late on leveller : @entity24 scored the equaliser after @entity4 had edged in front with eight minutes remaining game on : @entity24 celebrates his goal that levelled the game before @entity25 went on to win the tie opposite number @entity138 , meanwhile , was thrilled with his side ’s comeback , achieved thanks to @entity24 ’s 25 - yard fizzer and @entity28 ’s stooping header			1
‘ we created chances but we just had to be patient against 10 men			0
we went behind and it took a bit of inspiration from @entity24 to get us back in – it was top class , ’ he said			1
‘ to then get the winner was brilliant and i ’m proud of my players , it was a crazy end but it was a fantastic night for the club			0
it ’s a big moment for this club because we know what it meant to the people of @entity25			1
‘ we gave everything to make a bit of history and won at @entity85 for the first time in over 80 years			1
’ under pressure : @entity0 is on borrowed time at @entity4 after another defeat winner , winner : @entity28 completes a dramatic turnaround with @entity25 's second goal at @entity85			1

@entity25 came from behind in the dying minutes to beat @entity4
@entity21 put @entity4 in front eight minutes from time
@entity24 and @entity28 hit back immediately for @entity25
@entity56 was sent off for @entity4 in the first half
