insurers are facing a multi-million pound compensation bill after a major report has revealed how they duped savers into taking poor value pension deals			1
the @entity6 watchdog yesterday laid bare how pensioners were missing out on income of up to £ 230million a year because of the tactics used by some major firms			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) found that companies had flouted their own fair play rules , sent out pages of jargon - filled documents , failed to encourage pensioners to shop around and used misleading telephone sales tactics			1
insurers are facing a multi-million pound compensation bill after a report revealed they duped savers into taking poor pension deals - meaning pensioners are missing out on up to £ 230million a year ( file picture ) it is a stunning victory for @entity24 – which last year exposed the dirty tricks that insurers use to stop customers getting the best pension income possible			1
yesterday , an expert said that hundreds of thousands of savers may be entitled to compensation if it is discovered that they were misled in signing up to a pension income known as an annuity			1
government - appointed older workers ’ champion @entity36 said : ‘ it is vital that anyone who has suffered from the disgraceful mis - selling identified by the regulator should be compensated			2
‘ a clear message needs to be sent to insurers that such careless selling of potentially unsuitable and irreversible products is a serious failure that will result in money being paid out			1
’ in 2013 , the @entity11 launched an investigation to probe why pensioners were failing to get the best deals			1
yesterday , it described how they were misled			0
it found : the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) found that companies had flouted their own fair play rules the amount that retirees can receive from an annuity varies hugely between insurers , and the sick or smokers can get much bigger payouts			1
insurers have their own codes of conduct , which lay out the responsibilities of firms to tell customers they should shop around for the best deal			1
however , around four in ten pensioners just take a payout offered by the insurer with which they have saved			0
the @entity11 found that 79 per cent of them could have got a much bigger income if they had shopped around			1
and 91 per cent of savers who are ill or who smoke could also have got a bigger income – in some cases as much as 40 per cent			2
in total , 150,000 people a year receive a worse income than they should have			2
and one in five never even realised that they could switch to a better deal			0
@entity83 of the @entity84 , said : ‘ annuities have often been a licence to print money for those selling them			0
uninformed , vulnerable customers put faith in companies to give them help but they have been let down			0
’ the @entity11 has demanded the insurers ’ code of practice be scrapped and has ordered firms who are believed to have sold unsuitable annuities to review sales dating back to 2008			1
an estimated 2.4million annuities are thought to have been taken out since this time			0
pensions minister @entity101 said : ‘ the most striking thing is the @entity11 is suggesting if you try to buy an annuity , the company will have to do the shopping around on your behalf			1
if they can make that work , it is a game - changer			0
’ the @entity11 added that firms need to overhaul their practices ahead of pension reforms coming in next april which will allow savers to cash in their pension pots rather than having to buy an annuity			1
last september , @entity24 published an expose of the dirty tricks that insurers used to deprive savers of thousands of pounds worth of pension income			1
we accused these giant firms of flouting their own codes of conduct , using telephone sales teams to dupe customers into taking poor deals , sending out information designed to confuse , and failing to tell customers , particularly the sick , that shopping around could nab them a bigger income			1
the investigation was the culmination of weeks of work , part of which was a dossier of evidence put together by whistleblowers			0
when we published , it shook the insurance firms			0
a number immediately accused us of scare - mongering			0
the trade body the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) launched an investigation , but it was a whitewash			0
director - general @entity145 told us : ‘ we did not find the code was breached or that our members were trying to undermine the aims of the code			0
’ the @entity142 ’s findings bore no relation to the experiences of ordinary savers , such as widows who lost a pension because their husbands were misled or workers who missed out on thousands because they did n’t know to shop around			2
with the publication of the damning report by @entity6 watchdog the @entity11 yesterday , the @entity142 ’s findings seem incredible			1
it is vindication of @entity165 ’s excellent investigation and @entity24 ’s long - running campaign			2
but now the multi-million pound annuity rip - off may finally be at an end , those who are suffering in retirement because they have been duped need justice			1
this fight has only just begun			0
insurers have been told to go through their past sales			0
it could lead to a flood of mis - selling claims			0
we must avoid another whitewash			0
you can guarantee these firms which have cheated their customers all the way down the line are going to battle every step of the way to deny them a proper payout once more			2
cancer patient @entity190 ( pictured ) missed out on the best pension deal because he took an annuity designed for healthy savers cancer patient @entity190 missed out on the best pension deal because he took an annuity designed for healthy savers			1
when he retired last year , the company he had saved with for 23 years , @entity195 , passed him on to insurer @entity196			0
the 62 - year - old from @entity198 , @entity199 , was ill as a child and last year he underwent tests for suspected cancer			2
but he said neither firm asked him about his health			0
after discovering he could be entitled to more money , mr @entity190 contacted @entity195			0
in august , @entity196 paid back his remainder of his £ 27,000 pot , less the income payments he had received			2
@entity195 paid him £ 300 compensation			2
mr @entity190 said : ‘ you save all your life for your pension but you may as well take it to the bookies and gamble it away			2
’ @entity195 said mr @entity190 had not told it of his health problems but ‘ we subsequently put mr @entity190 back in the same position he would have been in had he not bought an annuity ’			1
@entity196 said it ‘ apologised unreservedly ’ .			0
