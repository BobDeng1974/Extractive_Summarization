a @entity0 directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts comes into force today in an attempt to reduce energy use			1
it is a blow to families and pet owners who value powerful vacuums for making house cleaning quick and easy			1
the @entity0 also plans to target other high - powered devices from next spring			1
it has conducted a study which suggests there could be 30 per cent energy savings on hairdryers , smartphones and lawnmowers			0
@entity35 , from the @entity36 , told the @entity37 : ‘ it ’s ludicrous			0
if you ’re reducing the power it ’s taking longer so the client is unhappy , but if you ’re reducing the power you ’re holding the dryer for longer so they ’re using the same amount of energy anyway			0
’ kettle manufacturers could be told to make their products consume less energy by switching off ten seconds earlier , and by redesigning to reduce ‘ surface heat loss ’			0
the final decision on which products to target will be made next year			2
the @entity0 ruling bans the import or manufacture of vacuum cleaners over 1,600 watts from today , although stores will still be able to sell their remaining stock			1
popular models by @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , which will be affected by the ban , had already sold out online last week at @entity64 and @entity65			0
@entity65 had exhausted stocks of the 2,300 - watt @entity67 and 2,000 - watt @entity69 cleaners , while @entity64 had sold out of models including the 2,100 - watt @entity71			1
at the weekend some shoppers said they had found out about the ruling only at the last minute			0
@entity74 , 30 , who has just bought his first home in @entity76 , @entity77 , said : ‘ i was just about to get the keys when i saw about the high - powered vacuums being banned			1
i panicked and wanted a powerful one so went to @entity81 to try to avoid disappointment			0
‘ i ca n’t believe they ’re banning them , it does n’t make any sense			2
’ hairdressers have come out against banning powerful hairdryers , saying it will upset clients and less powerful dryers would be used for longer - using more electricity ( stock picture ) june @entity94 , 60 , shopping in @entity96 , said : ‘ the powerful models are the only ones which can get the house properly clean			1
i ’ve just bought a @entity100			0
i think the new rules are ridiculous			0
’ some stores were allowing shoppers to buy by phone to collect at a later date			0
other stores said weekend trading had been normal – but @entity65 has reported an increase of nearly 44 per cent in sales of 2,000 - watt cleaners in the past fortnight , while the co-op ’s sales rose by 38 per cent			2
today ’s ban on cleaners over 1,600 watts will be followed by a further reduction to 900 watts from 2017			1
the average vacuum is currently 1,800 watts , and lower power has previously meant less suction			2
but sir @entity120 said the change could force firms to invest in more efficient technology			2
he said : ‘ @entity120 has never made a vacuum cleaner of more than 1,400 watts because it is intelligent engineering that leads to high cleaning performance , not energy - thirsty motors			1
’ @entity120 has reported a 78 per cent increase in cleaner sales since the news over energy labelling broke .			0
