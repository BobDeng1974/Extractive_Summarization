the @entity10 professor stood to inherit a vast @entity3 estate but ignored it and died impoverished aged 85 in a nursing home how the life of a @entity34 - educated ancestor of @entity3 gentry spiraled into bankruptcy and ill health , has been revealed to @entity38 by mr @entity8 's close friend @entity39			1
@entity8 was born and raised in @entity40 , @entity10 with his sisters @entity22 and @entity23 ( known as @entity42 )			1
his father @entity43 was a high school principal in the area			2
mr @entity8 's mother liked to travel and lived separately from their father once the three children had grown up			1
free spirit : @entity50 was educated at @entity34 , loved nature and adventure stories as a young man , @entity8 studied at @entity34 , where he was on the track team and excelled in his major biology			1
in the summer , he went on college expeditions to identify native fauna in regions like the @entity59			2
mr @entity8 was a close friend of the second son of aviator @entity61			1
@entity62 was a renowned diver and a pioneer of cage diving who studied marine biology at @entity34			1
in his youth , @entity50 was extremely handsome but , according to mr @entity39 , had no known romances and he never married			1
after gaining his masters degree , mr @entity8 took up a teaching post at @entity34 and later taught at @entity72			1
upon the death of his father in 1965 , @entity8 moved into the family home in @entity40 with sweeping views of the @entity77			2
his sister @entity23 , who was around ten years younger than @entity8 , also attended @entity34			1
@entity23 , known as ' @entity42 ' , was involved in organic agriculture and established the @entity80 in @entity40 alongside her elder brother			1
around 2005 , mr @entity8 suffered a stroke and his sister became his only carer , defying any use of @entity87 medicine and relying on her own remedies			1
the brother and sister moved to the @entity91 in @entity92 the following year			1
the way it was : this archive photo from the 1930s shows @entity97 in all its pride on the @entity8 estate in @entity13 falling down : this derelict remains of the 19th century @entity97 manor house on the @entity8 estate in @entity13			2
the estate ran to ruin after lying uncared for over 40 years he told @entity38 : ' i met @entity8 and @entity23 in late 2006 and decided to help them with their legal problems			2
i visited with @entity8 frequently and i would take them to church on sundays			0
' they ended up living in an old camper and were content , having no debts and living quite simply on their combined @entity115 checks of $ 1,400 monthly			0
' @entity8 only talked to people he felt comfortable with			0
he could read out loud in a strong voice and loved to read adventure stories and stories of the @entity120			0
' however mr @entity39 said that the fortunes of the free - spirited mr @entity8 changed when a relative filed a lawsuit to become @entity8 's guardian			1
mr @entity39 added : ' @entity42 ignored the court summons until an attorney representing the @entity127 served them personally			1
from that day on , their life spiraled down hill			0
' mr @entity39 had a friend represent mr @entity8 pro bono - where a judge handed over guardianship to @entity135 , including his possession and @entity115 checks			1
fellow adventurous spirit : @entity34 graduate student @entity62 , son of aviator @entity61 , was a close friend of @entity8 - @entity8 his friend continued : ' it was then reported that @entity23 was not taking good care of @entity8			1
he was placed in a '' guest home '' subject to only approved visitors and limited outings			0
' following the death of the rightful heir to @entity8 estate two years ago , the property and vast lands once again were open to dispute			2
the next male heir - the only person who wanted to restore the estate to its former glory - has been left with a vastly reduced sum because of a change to the century - old will			1
the legal document had originally said that only a male heir could inherit the lands and 19th - century @entity97 manor house			1
esteemed : mr @entity8 excelled in his studies at @entity34 and later went on to teach at the college @entity162 never indicated to the @entity164 @entity163 that he wanted to accept @entity165 after the death of his father @entity43 in 1965			1
this meant it was prevented from passing to the second - in - line , his cousin and only male heir , @entity172			1
the retired farmer and father - of - four from @entity175 said that he wanted to live and work on the family estate			2
the @entity164 courts recognized mr @entity178 as a legitimate heir			2
however because of the legal impasse , @entity180 lay empty			0
over the years , the mansion fell into disrepair after lying empty and unloved while the land and gardens became overgrown			0
parts of the estate were sold off to pay death duties and administration costs			0
cut out : @entity172 , pictured with his wife , visits the estate which he was due to inherit as the only male heir before changes to the will cut him out mr @entity8 's death allowed the destiny of the estate to be decided by a judge at the @entity198 in @entity199			2
an original clause which said the estate would pass to a male heir was cut out and the sale proceeds of the estate split between @entity26 's next - of - kin , his elderly sisters in @entity10			1
some £ 130,000 ( around $ 200,000 ) will go to the closest surviving male heir , @entity178 , their cousin			2
@entity164 's @entity209 , who deals with such property matters , tried in vain to contact @entity50 about his vast inheritance 30 years ago			1
in 1985 , the @entity209 wrote : ‘ @entity26 , by the stroke of a pen and by meeting some other details , can take over the property			0
' yet i do not know his address			0
’ the history of @entity180 has long been marked with scandal and family tragedy			0
in 1856 , @entity222 was the first to move into @entity97			0
he lived there in grandeur with his wife , son and four daughters			1
@entity222 with three of his children , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 however their idyllic life came to be tainted by a bitter legal battle surrounding @entity222 's will			0
the estate , according to legal documents drawn up by a previous owner , was intended to pass to the eldest male heir			2
however @entity222 also wanted his daughters to share in the property			0
however @entity8 's eldest son @entity229 , a known heavy drinker , challenged the legal changes while his father was still alive			2
@entity229 lost the battle against his sisters soon after his father died and shortly before his own early death			0
the @entity13 estate was then thrown into turmoil			0
with only four @entity253 daughters left - all spinsters and with no male heir - no one could inherit the house and lands			1
two remained spinsters and one married but did not have children			0
and the fourth sister scandalized local society with her love life			2
when she was 19 , she ran off to @entity263 with coachman @entity264 who was in his thirties and married with four sons			0
@entity231 soon regretted her actions			0
the @entity268 reported in april 1882 : ‘ the unfortunate girl ’s story was a pitiful one			0
' she wished herself back home within 24 hours of leaving , and left her swain distinguishing himself as a waiter at an hotel			0
’ her parents were on the dockside to greet her on her return to @entity279 , @entity280			0
she found a more suitable partner in @entity282 , a tea broker 's son , and they married in march 1884			2
the couple moved to @entity285 and then to @entity10 , and their four children took the surname @entity288			1
@entity231 ’s eldest son @entity290 , a gold miner in @entity10 , was due to take over the estate on the deaths of his mother and @entity13 aunts			1
in 1947 , he visited the estate and invited the tenant farmers to a meeting at @entity299 to announce his intention of restoring the estate to its former glory			0
however @entity43 was annoyed that his elderly aunts had let the estate become run down			0
he would not sign a document saying that he was satisfied the estate and would take it on			0
he returned to @entity10 and died in 1965			1
the estate then passed to his eldest son @entity26 where the legal wranglings continued until this year			2
@entity311 , vice-chairman of @entity312 said recently that he was delighted the long - running will dispute was finally settled			2
he said it gave a chance for the estate to be rejuvenated			0
mr @entity311 said that just before @entity318 , @entity317 , a distant cousin of @entity26 , addressed @entity312 with plans to open a new campsite on part of the estate he had just bought			0
that plan will be subject to planning approval from @entity326			0
‘ most people have forgotten the estate is there because the dispute went on so long , ' mr @entity311 added			0
but i think locals will be pleased to know it 's finally been settled			0
’ crumbling : this picture shows the stable block at @entity97 on the estate in @entity13			0
