@entity0 has a vocal supporter in fellow former @entity3 captain @entity2 as he clings to renewed hope that he might yet play international cricket again			1
@entity3 and @entity7 chairman @entity6 has provided the first hint that @entity0 could resume a career which reached an apparently irrevocable full stop when he was sacked 13 months ago			1
@entity0 was in optimistic mood again on monday that an unlikely reconciliation could be achieved , tweeting : ' incredibly humbling how supportive you 've all been since the news broke yesterday from mr @entity6			2
gon na try work this out for sure ! ' @entity0 has made no secret of his desire to return to the @entity3 setup but it seems unlikey indications in the 24 hours since @entity6 ' @entity22 interview appear to have been less encouraging for the exiled 34 - year - old batsman			1
the @entity24 issued a statement on sunday , insisting ' nothing has changed ' in his status and adding ' only players who are playing consistent high - quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for @entity3 '			1
but @entity22 pundit @entity2 has called for face - to - face discussions in which the governing body is ' fair ' to @entity0 and does not ' lead him on ' without a true intention to recall him as long as he plays well			1
he also suggested that , if key personalities such as @entity24 managing director @entity37 and national selector @entity38 disagree with @entity6 , they should leave their jobs			2
@entity6 stressed the pre-requisite of any conceivable progress must be a return to county cricket , something @entity0 's summer @entity46 contracts in the @entity48 and @entity49 premier leagues will hardly help			1
new @entity24 chairman @entity6 suggested over the weekend the door could still be open for @entity0 his involvement in @entity54 domestic cricket for @entity55 last summer was fleeting - exclusively in the @entity57 - following his sacking by @entity3			1
@entity37 has spoken on several occasions since then of the record - breaking batsman 's apparent ' disengagement ' with his team - mates while @entity3 were losing the final @entity62 in @entity63 by 281 runs			2
@entity55 de-registered @entity0 at the end of last season , and are not publicly inclined to reopen negotiations			0
boycott has identified clear communication between @entity0 and @entity6 as the starting point to ensure no new stumbling blocks are created			1
he told the @entity22 : ' it says to me that @entity0 needs to get a meeting with @entity6 as soon as he can - and , preferably , with @entity37 and @entity38 there after he has spoken to the chairman - because he wants to be clear			1
@entity77 chairman @entity6 wants @entity0 ( right ) to play county cricket ' it 's all right the chairman saying he has to play county cricket			1
but if he does that and gives up a lucrative @entity85 contract and @entity37 and @entity38 are still not going to pick him , that 's kind of like leading him on is n't it ? and that 's not fair			0
' it needs to be put clear to him that if he plays well in county cricket then there 's going to be a genuine - and i mean the word genuine - change of heart and change of opinion that he is going to be open for selection and that they are going to put bygones to one side			1
' i do n't think that it is fair to ask anybody to give up an @entity85 contract - because that 's all he has			0
' he only has @entity46 around the world			0
' boycott senses @entity37 and @entity38 could even be expendable , if there is a difference of opinion on @entity0 between them and former @entity112 chairman @entity110			2
he added : ' if @entity38 and @entity37 ca n't accept a change of plan or opinion from the chairman then they have to resign , do n't they ? former @entity3 captain @entity2 has warned the @entity24 to not ' lead on ' @entity0 over a possible return ' it 's simple			1
they have to do what the chairman tells them , or go			0
' we need to listen to our chairman from @entity112			0
he is very quiet and a nice man - but underneath he has got some steel about him			0
' there was , understandably , little engagement in the @entity0 topic from former team - mate @entity134 who has more pressing issues to confront in @entity136 and @entity137 as @entity3 try to stay in the @entity138 after three defeats in four matches			2
@entity134 is tipped by many as a future @entity3 captain , however , and opinions such as his could yet be pivotal to @entity0 's chances of a recall			2
he made it clear @entity0 is hardly uppermost in his mind at present , but also that he has a good working relationship with the @entity150 - born batsman			0
@entity0 ( left ) has recently been playing for the @entity151 in @entity136 's @entity153 competition ' we 're in the middle of the @entity138 , and there 's plenty of other stuff we need to be focusing on , ' said @entity134			0
' he does n't really enter that			0
i 've no problems with @entity162			0
i 've not spoken to him for a while , but he seems to be doing okay			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , intends to seek an audience with @entity6 - well aware he and his advisers must somehow try to resurrect a county career before they can think about any more glory days with @entity3			1
his world - class standing means he can command a budget - busting salary , but if he finds himself in a position where he needs a county contract at all costs , he could perhaps be re-entering a buyer 's market			0
he closed his monday tweet with a ' peace ' motif - but it will surely be a vexed process if he is to get his wish .			0

@entity0 admits he *'d* love to play cricket for @entity3 again

the batsman would be forced to drop a @entity46 *franchise* to play county
