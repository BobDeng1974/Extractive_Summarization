it should aim to protect you from the wind and avoid possibly perilous spots such as a riverbank if you 're a skier you should use your skies to help you gather a huge pile of snow - around five foot high or more			2
you should then pat it down and leave it to settle before you hollow out a cave the cave should be several feet deep sloping slightly up			0
pine boughs should be placed at the base for added insulation and to stop the body being in contact with the snow the ceiling is then carved into a dome shape the site recommends a wall thickness of 12 + inches with a ventilation hole general manager of @entity9 @entity81 was with the family when they heard the news			2
