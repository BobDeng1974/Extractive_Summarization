speaking in @entity10 , @entity1 chief executive @entity0 said that the firm is working on a paid - for service , and is ‘ optimistic that [ users ] will see it soon			1
’ it is expected to rival @entity16 by offering ad - free , and offline access to millions of videos			1
but ms @entity0 declined to say exactly when the service would launch while addressing the audience at @entity22 ’s @entity21 in @entity10			2
prices have not been announced either			0
speculation about @entity1 ’s @entity16 rival began last year when ‘ two people familiar with the matter ’ announced its arrival was imminent			1
it is expected to allow playback of videos without adverts , and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices			2
this would match the options offered by @entity16 on its own paid - for subscriptions , but with the added bonus of videos			1
reports claim @entity1 has already reached deals with all three major music labels - @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 - and many independent labels , representing about 95 per cent of all labels			1
but the sources added that a small number of independent artists who had not agreed to new deal terms will have their videos blocked in some countries starting in a few days , even on the free version of @entity1			2
@entity1 is rumoured to be looking at ways to block the music videos so users of the test version wo n't be confused about which content they can access for free and with features require payment			1
the move also adds pressure on those labels to sign , because not being on @entity1 altogether will result in less advertising revenue and exposure			0

it is expected to allow playback of videos with adverts , and let people watch videos offline on mobile devices			0
this would match the options offered by @entity16 on its own paid - for subscriptions , but with the added bonus of videos , for example it will not be the first time @entity1 has experimented with paid - for plans			1

over 50 channels were launched as subscription - only , but not all paid - for channels can be subscribed to in the @entity107 - namely @entity111 , and @entity112			2
the revenue split between @entity1 and the channel producers and musicians is expected to be similar to the 45 - 55 split that @entity1 currently has with advertising revenue			2
at a media conference last year , @entity1 's ceo @entity118 said that a subscription model would give networks and producers a more direct line to their audience with lower costs			2
a @entity84 spokesman added : ' we have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models			0
' there are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions , so we 're looking at that			0
' it will not be the first time @entity1 has experimented with paid - for plans			1
