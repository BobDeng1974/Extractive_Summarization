the new creature named @entity1 is a relative of the snow leopard			1
here the big cat is illustrated based on details from the skull discovered the world 's oldest big cat has been unearthed in @entity9			2
its skull was discovered in the @entity12 and could date back almost six million years			2
the new creature , named @entity1 , is a relative of the elusive snow leopard and sheds new light on the evolution of lions , jaguars and tigers , @entity14 scientists said			1
using magnetostratigraphy - the technique of dating fossils based on the distinctive patterns of reversals in the @entity28 's magnetic field that are recorded in layers of rock - the skull is estimated to be 4.1 to 5.95 million years old			1
it points to central @entity32 as the place of origin for big cats and the @entity9 plateau as a critical region for understanding their diversification			0
dr @entity40 , of the @entity42 in @entity43 , said : ' this find suggests big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspected			0
' dna evidence suggests big cats - known collectively as @entity47 , which include lions , jaguars , tigers , leopards , snow leopards and clouded leopards - diverged from their nearest evolutionary cousins @entity56 , typified by cougars , lynxes and domestic cats about 6.37 million years ago			1
however , the oldest fossils of big cats , which were found in the 1970s , are tooth fragments uncovered at in @entity62 alongside early humans and are 3.6 million years old			2
the latest species described in @entity65 challenges previous suppositions about the evolution of big cats and helps place them in geographical context			0
using magnetostratigraphy - dating fossils based on the distinctive patterns of reversals in the @entity28 's magnetic field which are recorded in layers of rock - the skull is estimated to be 4.1 to 5.95 million years old the discovery was made in a region that includes the majority of current big cat habitats and suggests the group evolved in central @entity32 and spread outwards			1
the skull was discovered in the @entity12 and could date back almost six million years the new creature , named @entity1 , is a relative of the elusive snow leopard and sheds new light on the evolution of lions , jaguars and tigers			1
it points to central @entity32 as the place of origin for big cats some six million years ago and the @entity9 plateau as a critical region for understanding their diversification dr @entity40 , of the @entity42 in @entity43 , said : ' this find suggests big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspected			2
' recent estimates have suggested that lions , tigers , jaguars , leopards and snow leopards did not split from clouded leopards until 3.72 million years ago , which the find also disproves			1
dr @entity109 , his wife dr @entity111 of @entity112 in @entity113 and dr @entity114 , of the @entity115 , discovered the skull in 2010 while scouting in the remote border region between @entity118 and @entity119 - an area that takes a bumpy seven - day car ride to reach from @entity122			0
dr @entity111 found over one hundred antelope limbs and jaws likely deposited by a river and below these was the crushed , but largely complete , remains of the skull			0
dr @entity109 , a student at @entity128 when he led the expedition , said : ' it was just lodged in the middle of all that mess			0
' the new creature , named @entity1 is a relative of the snow leopard ( pictured ) and throws new light on the evolution of lions , jaguars and tigers for the past three years the researchers have used both anatomical and @entity144 data to confirm the skull does represent a new species			1
they plan to return to the site next summer to search for more specimens			0
professor @entity149 , curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the @entity115 , said : ' we are in the business of discovery			0
we go out into the world in search of new fossils to illuminate the past			0
' the cat has taken its name from @entity160 ; the snow - leopard - loving daughter of @entity163 and @entity164 who are avid supporters of the @entity115 of @entity166 .			2
