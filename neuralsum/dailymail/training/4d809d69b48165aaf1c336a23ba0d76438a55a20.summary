it would be decades before what was left of the crew aboard the plane known as @entity34 would be returned home			2

she says she has never really gotten over the loss of her love @entity42 : @entity36 displays her deceased husband 's military identification tag , the only relic returned to her after his remains were discovered last year frozen memories : a @entity22 family photo and a photo of @entity38 in his air - crew flight suit is seen in the home of @entity36 in @entity23 , @entity24 their charred remains were found last year and identified through dental records , personal items and other circumstantial evidence			1
all six were buried in a single casket with full military honors , as is common in situations where remains ca n't be conclusively linked to a specific individual			1
love : a picture of @entity38 in his @entity65 service uniform contains the inscription : ' to my dearest darling @entity69 with all my love , @entity71 ' the @entity65 gave all six posthumous promotions , a military spokeswoman said			1
their job was a search - and - destroy mission on the @entity78 trail			1
their target was a way station believed to be housing ammunition depots and anti-aircraft batteries , according to @entity84			2
but at one point , something went wrong			2
they were last heard from somewhere over the @entity6 jungle when a distress call rang out : ' @entity90 , @entity34 21			2
' they were never seen again			0
it 's unclear whether the plane had suffered a mechanical malfunction or was shot down by enemy forces			0
for nearly half a century , the airmen 's families endured an emotional kaleidoscope that they say is difficult to describe to those who never had to face it			0
the men were listed for years as missing , and family members held out hope at first that their loved ones had survived			1
for most that hope faded over time , despite an occasional unconfirmed report that crew members were seen alive			0
the crash site has been excavated several times over the past decade , but it was not until 2010 and 2011 that human remains were recovered			0
even though @entity36 's husband perhaps had the most conclusive identification of all six crew members - a tooth of @entity22 's was recovered and matched through dental records - she and her son @entity112 said they still have nagging doubts about what happened			0
both said they appreciated monday 's service and were grateful so many people came to pay respects , but they said they have had a difficult time getting answers over the years			1
combat : the servicemen were flying in an @entity128 when it was shot down the tooth , in their mind , raises more questions than answers : if a single tooth was found , they wonder , would n't it make sense that other teeth or perhaps his skull could be found also ? @entity112 said that while they approached last year 's burial service at @entity144 with the feeling it might help provide closure , that comfort proved elusive			1
' this may be the only thing we get , ' he said			0
for @entity152 , 86 , of @entity153 , @entity154 , the hardest part of the service was seeing how emotional it was for her children , who were teenagers when their father died			0
' i 've lived with it for so long , i 'm all teared out , ' said @entity14 , who appreciated the opportunity to meet the families of her husband 's fellow airmen			0
' for all these years we just had a list of names			1

the first joint @entity188 - @entity195 team did n't visit the crash site until 1995 in the southern province of @entity198 , which was heavily bombed during the war as it lay on the @entity78 supply route that supplied @entity202 communist guerrillas in southern @entity6			1
a villager recalled seeing a two - propeller aircraft crash near the village			0
a second villager had found wreckage of it and took the team to the crash site			0
follow - up teams revisited the site four times between 1999 and 2001 and recovered military equipment but no human remains , and excavation was suspended			2

it is not uncommon in situations like these for joint sets of remains to buried at @entity144			1
the @entity239 's @entity238 lists more than 83,000 service members as missing in action , the vast majority from @entity243 in 2011 , the office identified the remains of 62 service members previously unaccounted for			0
in an interview with the @entity1 last year , @entity247 of @entity12 , @entity13 , who was only 2 when his father 's plane went down , said monday 's burial brings his father home and resolves ' this nagging , disjointed feeling that he 's not where he belongs			0
' he said he has struggled to understand his own emotions in the months since learning that his father 's remains had been found and would be buried at @entity144			1
