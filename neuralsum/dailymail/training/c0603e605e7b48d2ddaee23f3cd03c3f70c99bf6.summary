a stowaway fell thousands of feet from a plane on to a quiet suburban street after apparently hiding in the landing gear			1
the body of the victim , in his thirties and from @entity8 , was discovered in an affluent @entity10 neighbourhood under the @entity12 flight path			1
aviation experts say he was probably dead before he hit the ground either because he had been crushed by the retracting landing gear shortly after the plane took off or because of the extreme cold at high altitude			1
detectives initially believed mr @entity21 was from @entity22 as he had the country 's currency on him when he was found in the street in @entity27 , pictured probe : forensics were on the scene in the affluent @entity10 suburb after the extraordinary incident it is thought the man ’s body dropped from the aircraft undercarriage as the plane came in to land			1
residents on the tree - lined road in @entity27 , on the south bank of the @entity42 less than ten miles from the airport , yesterday spoke of their shock on finding the body after hearing a loud bang			1
@entity47 , 26 , a security guard who lives opposite where the man fell , said he saw the body ‘ all twisted up ’			2
he said : ‘ it is unbelievable			0
the first thing i thought when i saw the body was that it must have fallen from quite a height			2
location : home : the only evidence left on the scene in @entity27 , south west @entity10 , was dark smears on the pavement where the blood was cleared up ‘ you could tell by the way his body was mangled			1
there was a big pool of blood coming from his head			0
’ last night , others said they were amazed blood could still be seen on the family street			0
@entity74 , a mother of two , said it was ‘ disgusting ’ that the scene had not been cleared up			0
‘ it ’s shocking you can still see splatters of blood , ’ she said , adding that the body was left uncovered by police for ‘ a good few hours ’ after it was found			2
she said : ‘ we just wonder what made him get in that plane and want so badly to escape			0
’ another resident , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ no one saw him fall because it was early on a sunday morning			0
‘ whatever he was trying to escape from must have been horrendous to make him do that			0
’ @entity91 , of the @entity92 , said a stowaway in an aircraft undercarriage was unlikely to have survive as he would either be crushed by the wheels after take - off or freeze in temperatures as low as minus @entity97 ( minus @entity98 )			0
he said : ‘ the chances of survival for a stowaway are very slim , particularly in the recess of the landing gear			1
‘ i do n’t know of anyone who has survived being stowed away on a long - haul flight			0
‘ when the landing gear comes down at the other end , a few miles from the runway and about 2,000ft in the air , if there is a person who had died they would fall out			1
’ police said they were investigating whether the body was that of a stowaway			0
’ the discovery comes just over a fortnight after the body of a stowaway was found in the landing gear recess of a @entity122 plane arriving at @entity12 from @entity123			1
