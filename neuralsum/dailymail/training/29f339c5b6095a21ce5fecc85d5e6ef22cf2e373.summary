do n't they know they 're meant to be at each other 's throats this weekend ? @entity5 pair @entity4 and @entity6 were all smiles with @entity9 star @entity8 as they took part in a joint @entity13 charity event			1
but the @entity14 all did seem incredibly chummy considering the tension that 's building in the city ahead of one of the biggest clashes of the season			0
@entity5 pair @entity4 ( left ) and @entity6 and @entity9 defender @entity8 ( right ) the @entity14 trio were taking part in the event ahead of the @entity24 derby on sunday the trio , representing the @entity25 and @entity9 in the @entity26 , also put some young fans through their paces at a training session on friday afternoon - while @entity30 showed off a few flicks and tricks of his own			1
they may very well have been reminiscing about their run to the @entity35 final in the summer with @entity36 , even though @entity30 missed the latter stages through injury			0
but you imagine things will be a lot more hostile when they take to the pitch at the @entity43 on sunday , with four points and five league positions currently separating the sides			0
for @entity8 , who has been at @entity9 since 2008 , the derby is something he has experienced many times before			1
however , for the @entity5 pair it will be a new world entirely , although @entity30 's @entity53 experience with @entity54 , and @entity6 's time playing for @entity55 against @entity56 in the @entity57 should stand them in good stead			2
@entity30 puts a young @entity5 fan through his paces during the event in @entity24 and the forward watches as another attempts a few of her best flicks and tricks the @entity14 then showed off a few of his best moves as the lucky youngsters stood back and admired after years of domination over their city rivals , @entity5 have been forced into @entity9 's shadow in recent clashes			1
@entity9 have won the last three derbies in the @entity13 , and you have to go as far back as december 1970 for the last time they made it four in a row in the top flight			2
@entity5 have not won a derby since 2012 , when a @entity84 free - kick gave them a last - gasp 3 - 2 victory			0
@entity86 will have captain @entity87 - the top scorer in @entity24 derbies - at his disposal following suspension but @entity91 will be without playmaker @entity92 , who has been ruled out for three weeks with a knee ligament injury .			0
