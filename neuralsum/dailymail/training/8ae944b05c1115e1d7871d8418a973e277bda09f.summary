@entity1 was still barking out the orders in @entity3 on the rain - swept pitches of @entity7 's @entity6 training ground this week , shouting : ' chance to score , you should score ! ' at players over-elaborating in front of goal in the morning six - a - sides			1
it will be a while before he 's directing his new charges in @entity16 but ahead of his first @entity18 derby on sunday night , midfielder @entity15 has reassured him : ' nothing is being lost in translation '			1
@entity1 has already been teased for a recent press conference when he dared try out his first few words in @entity16 ' dos , tres , cuatro ' before reverting to @entity3 but @entity15 knows all about the language barrier from his days playing under @entity27 at @entity28			1
@entity1 speaks with the bench during a @entity31 match between @entity7 and @entity32 former @entity33 and @entity28 midfielder @entity15 has every faith that @entity1 will succeed in @entity16 the midfielder claims he finds @entity1 ' accent easier to undertstand than his former boss @entity27 ' @entity27 's accent was tough , @entity1 is easier to understand , ' says the former @entity33 midfielder who also played under @entity41 and @entity42			1
' we have a translator who is doing an excellent job and @entity3 is not such a strange language for us to understand			2
there are five or six players who speak the language and our goalkeeper @entity51 has also started classes			0
' @entity15 was the player @entity1 mistakenly referred to @entity53 in his opening match in charge but the midfielder has pointed to another top @entity58 coach who thrived in @entity59 without having the greatest command of @entity16			1
@entity61 won the @entity16 cup in 1987 with @entity63 but was also famous for turning standard @entity3 phrases such as ' headless chicken ' and ' pigs might fly ' directly into @entity16 , much to the amusement and bemusement of fans			1
@entity15 said : ' @entity61 is a legend here and not just because of those phrases , but it 's true they only added to the legend			1
we have a very important job to do here and that eclipses everything else			0
there might be a little thing that makes you laugh from time to time but that in no way affects the authority of the manager			2
we know he is the boss and we are ready to follow what he asks of us			0
' he has arrived at a moment when we have more desire than ever to learn and improve			0
anything he says to us , to that end , be it in @entity16 , @entity91 or @entity92 is important and will be taken in			1
' @entity61 became a legend with @entity63 after introducing his own phrases to the @entity16 vocabulary @entity7 have not posed as great a threat this season after selling star player @entity101 new signing @entity102 has struggled to score following his 7.5m euros move @entity15 has played for @entity27 , @entity41 and @entity42 in his career @entity1 has not got it easy			1
the team reached the @entity108 two seasons ago and finished seventh last year but much of that was down to @entity111 winger @entity101 who scored 16 goals in the last campaign but moved to @entity114 in the summer for 30m euros			1
the club spent 7.5m euros of that money on a new record signing before the season started brining in 25 - year - old @entity119 international @entity102 but after one training session this week he could be seen being given one - to - one tuition on receiving the ball on the half turn by @entity1 ' new assistant @entity124 – basic stuff for such an expensive acquisition			1
the new striker has so far been a massive disappointment , and elsewhere the squad could do with a couple of new signings , preferably in january			0
the biggest single message from the manger to his players since he arrived a month ago has been to drive home the need for greater intensity and aggression and it is a message that @entity15 , as a former @entity41 player , is no stranger to			1
' for @entity41 the aggression was very important , ' he says			0
' we were up against a @entity145 side at their absolute peak and it was almost impossible to get the ball off of them yet we still managed to win the league and beat them in the @entity152 and that was due , in no small part , to us imposing ourselves physically			0
' at @entity28 @entity27 was the same ; he wanted his team to be aggressive			1
in the @entity157 if you are not aggressive then you do n't touch the ball			0
' when i first moved to @entity160 i would find myself stopping during games thinking that the referee was going to give a foul but the whistle never came			0
it took me a while to readjust when i came back to @entity16			1
@entity1 will get used to the different refereeing here			1
' @entity15 takes the ball past @entity114 midfielder @entity170 during a @entity31 game this season the @entity16 midfielder believes there is very little difference between the @entity157 and @entity31 @entity1 watches over a training session ahead of his first home game in charge at the @entity178 that reference to the match officials is an important one			1
@entity182 can demand his team be more physical but he has to factor in the philosophy of many match officials that every foul is a yellow card			0
there will be other cultural differences to be overcome but @entity15 says @entity157 football and @entity31 fútbol are no longer miles apart in terms of style			1
' give it a few more years and there will be almost no difference at all , ' he says			0
' where there is a still a difference perhaps is with the forming of young players and how good the youth academies are in @entity16 but the @entity58 are n't stupid and they know that mixing the aggression and the physicality of their football with a better way of educating young players - something they have been doing for the last six or seven years will end up giving them a very strong team			2
give it another decade maximum and @entity160 will have one of the strongest teams in @entity214 again			0
' @entity15 speaks positively about @entity1 since his arrival at @entity7 one of the special things about sunday night 's derby is that almost all the players on both sides will be homegrown			1
@entity220 retain their @entity18 - only policy and @entity7 still learn heavily on their @entity222			1
@entity1 was five games into his reign as @entity226 manager last season when he faced his first @entity229 derby			1
on sunday night he finds himself facing his first @entity18 derby , once again , five games into a new job			2
@entity226 were beaten 4 - 1 by @entity233 last september and it was the first sign that not everyone was playing for the new man			2
it 's a very different scenario at @entity63 where players have been buoyed by his arrival			2
@entity15 believes he can lead them back towards the @entity108			2
@entity1 looks downcast while losing the @entity229 derby 4 - 1 to fierce rivals @entity233 in september 2013 @entity15 called on the advice of his close friend @entity244 ( left ) after @entity1 was appointed manager @entity1 was brought to the @entity16 club to realise their ambition of returning top the @entity108 he said : ' that is the challenge			1
the president wants it and i think the coach has come for that			0
we achieved it last season and we want it again			0
we know we have to go one step at a time but we have to be confident and ambitious			0
' we know we have to improve and we look to @entity1 as the key to that			2
he has prestige as a coach and this is a prestigious club			0
his ideas are very clear and he is really motivated			0
he wants to coach a big club and we want that the big club to be @entity7			2
getting back in the @entity108 is the challenge ; it is what we all want			0
' @entity15 was straight on to the phone to close friend @entity244 when @entity1 was confirmed as his new coach			1
' he spoke very highly of him			0
we all know what the big clubs are like – the criticism comes quickly and the coach always pays			0
but @entity244 said to me that he was unlucky there and that he would have liked for them to have shown a little bit more patience with him			0
their loss is now our gain			0
' the @entity18 derby is @entity16 's friendliest derby			1
' not unlike the @entity288 derby ' says @entity15 who played in two west @entity290 derbies in his season under @entity27			1
he won the fixture at @entity293 getting the better of @entity294 in charge at the time			0
@entity15 also played for current @entity233 manager @entity42 at @entity33 and comparing the @entity297 to @entity41 he said : ' they are a lot more alike than people would imagine			1
they each project a very different image but the reality is @entity42 shows plenty of fire in the dressing room and @entity41 usually stays very calm			0
' @entity42 is more calm in the dressing room than @entity41 , says @entity15 @entity15 insists there is more than meets the eye with his former boss @entity27 he also says @entity27 does not quite fit the image he projects			1
' there is more to @entity27 than meets the eye			2
he is a lot more studious and far more on top of things tactically than it seems			0
he can seem to be someone who is not completely on top of the training sessions but he is aware of everything that is happening			0
you do n't stay in football that long without that intelligence			0
' if @entity1 wants to stay in @entity16 football at @entity7 long term , getting the better of @entity63 's local rivals will be vital			1
his side will move to within two points of @entity220 if they can get the win the game			2
there has been a warm welcome for him on @entity16 's cold , wet northern coast			2
' he has come to the right place , ' says @entity15			2
' we hope he stays			0

@entity1 is preparing @entity7 for derby against @entity220
former @entity226 manager has been *mocked* for @entity16 accent
@entity15 says @entity343 is easier to understand than @entity27
@entity63 have not been as *threatening* since selling @entity101 , especially with @entity345 struggling to score
