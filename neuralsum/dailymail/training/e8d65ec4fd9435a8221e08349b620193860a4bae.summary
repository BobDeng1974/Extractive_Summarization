@entity1 batsman @entity0 believes new one - day captain @entity2 is the ' strong leader ' needed to drive the side forward			1
the squad convened in @entity5 this week without former skipper @entity6 , whose chronic lack of form saw him cut adrift and replaced with @entity2 on the eve of the @entity10			1
the @entity11 only has this month 's @entity12 against the host nation and @entity14 to put his stamp on a team that has struggled to find a winning formula in 50 - over cricket			2
but @entity2 is an entirely different character to @entity6 , having made his name as a dynamic short - form player rather than a @entity23 lynchpin , and @entity0 is confident he is the man to inspire a change in fortune			1
@entity1 captain @entity2 has been described as a ' strong leader ' by @entity0 jan 12 : @entity29 v @entity28 , @entity30 * jan 14 : @entity29 v @entity31 , @entity30 tri-series jan 16 : @entity5 v @entity1 , @entity34 jan 18 : @entity5 v @entity14 , @entity35 jan 20 : @entity1 v @entity14 , @entity36 jan 23 : @entity5 v @entity1 , @entity37 jan 26 : @entity5 v @entity14 , @entity34 jan 30 : @entity1 v @entity14 , @entity38 feb 1 : tri-series final , @entity38 * all matches are day / night except from @entity1 's first warm - up ' it 's an exciting time for @entity1 under @entity44 , it 's a new era , ' he said			1
' we 're all looking forward to playing under him			0
i know the kind of guy he is , he 's a strong guy and i 'm sure he 'll be a strong leader too			1
' he 'll be very similar to the way he bats : exciting and aggressive			0
' i have played under him in a couple of @entity55 against @entity56 and he 's a great captain			0
' @entity6 might find it hard to share in the sense of enthusiasm as he broods on his axeing and watches the side he led for three - and - a - half years on television			0
but with the odds stacked against @entity1 in both the tri-series and the @entity10 , the 15 - strong squad who began their trip @entity66 with a training session in @entity30 on friday can not afford to ponder their former 's leader 's fate			1
' it was a tough call but we 've got to move on , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's something we ca n't dwell on too much			0
you 're judged on performances and that 's what happened in the end with @entity6			0
' ultimately we 're all judged on performances and winning games and that 's what we 're aiming to do			0
@entity0 is looking forward to the new era under @entity2 ' we 're looking to get a bit of rhythm and form in the tri-series then in the @entity10 who knows what we could do			1
' @entity0 has just six odi caps to his name but booked his place on the plane by cracking 90 and 68 in successive innings in @entity97 last month			2
@entity6 's absence means a top - order shake - up is inevitable but what role the 25 - year - old @entity101 man has in it remains to be seen			0
@entity6 was sacked as @entity1 one day captain after a run of bad results and poor form ' hopefully it does open up a spot for me to play but it 's up to me to take the opportunity if it does appear , ' he said			2
' i do n't know where i 'll be batting in the side , i 'm just looking to get in the team			0
if it 's in the middle order or at number three i 'm not really fussed as long as i 'm playing			0
' i had a brief little taster in @entity97 and hopefully i can go one step further to cementing my spot in @entity5			2
' @entity1 are in action on monday , kicking off their trip with with a tour match against an @entity121 at the @entity122 .			1

@entity2 will lead @entity1 at the @entity10 in @entity5 in *february*
@entity0 says @entity2 is a ' strong leader ' and will drive @entity1 forward
@entity1 face an @entity121 in their first warm - up game on monday
