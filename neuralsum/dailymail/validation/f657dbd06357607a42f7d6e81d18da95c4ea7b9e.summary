the families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the @entity3 have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time			1
patients were infected with @entity10 and hepatitis c after receiving blood supplies which had not been properly tested			1
campaigners estimate more than 30,000 patients across the @entity15 were affected in the 1970s and 1980s , of whom 2,000 have died			2
many had the rare blood disorder haemophilia and were given regular transfusions with a clotting agent known as @entity21 to stop internal bleeding			2
the true scale of hepatitis c contracted via hospital transfusions has taken years to emerge because of the time it can take to start to experience symptoms			1
dame @entity44 caught it after a hospital blood transfusion following the birth of her daughter @entity49 in 1971			0
@entity51 founder lived with the disease for more than 30 years before discovering she had it , by which time she was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver			0
she died in 2007 aged 64 of a brain haemorrhage , a rare complication of the disease			0
the scandal was described as the ' worst treatment disaster in the history of the @entity3 ' and yesterday the prime minister apologised on behalf of the government			1
@entity63 addressed the @entity64 shortly after the @entity66 government published the findings from its own six - year , £ 6million inquiry into what happened			1
but victims and bereaved relatives who had gathered at the @entity72 in @entity26 , where the findings were read out , called it a ' whitewash '			2
they are furious that the inquiry did not blame individual doctors , @entity3 staff or politicians and said nothing could have been done differently			1
@entity81 from @entity82 criticised the findings of the six year @entity84 today mr @entity63 's apology follows a lengthy campaign by the @entity87 highlighting the plight of victims and relatives			1
addressing mps during prime minister 's questions in the @entity64 , mr @entity63 said he wanted to recognise the ' pain and suffering experienced by people as a result of this tragedy '			1
the prime minister added : ' it is difficult to imagine the feelings of unfairness that people must feel as a result of being infected by something like hepatitis c or @entity10 as a result of a totally unrelated treatment within the @entity3 , and to each and every one of those people , i would like to say sorry on behalf of the government for something that should not have happened			1
' in january , the @entity111 for @entity112 and @entity113 criticised the help provided to the thousands infected by contaminated blood during the 1970s and 80s			2
it said between 1970 and 1991 , contaminated @entity3 blood products caused an estimated 32,718 people to be infected with hepatitis @entity120 between 1978 and 1985 , 1,500 people were infected with the hiv virus in a similar way , most of whom were also infected with hepatitis @entity120 the @entity127 's @entity84 investigated only the cases of @entity66 victims , and the widow of @entity131 , who died of hepatitis c after being infected during a treatment for haemophilia , said it was a waste of time			1
@entity137 said : ' we have lost the heart and soul of our family			0
' it just ruined years of our lives			0
we wanted the truth , we wanted them to come out and say ' we did things wrong '			0
' @entity147 , 53 – a haemophiliac who was infected with hepatitis c – added : ' it does n't go deep enough , it does n't give everybody 's story			2
everybody 's case should have been in there			0
' there are still so many people who do n't know that they have actually got it			0
some people maybe do n't want to know			0
' by @entity160 it was a remedy that became a killer at the centre of a huge public health scandal			0
factor viii was a clotting agent developed in the 1970s for haemophiliacs			2
their condition means their blood fails to clot , and a minor cut can put sufferers at risk of bleeding to death			0
@entity177 companies made @entity21 from blood from donors including drug addicts and vagrants infected with hepatitis c and @entity10 who had been paid cash			2
the unscreened products were imported because @entity15 did not supply enough ' home - grown ' product			0
a quarter of a century ago , the @entity87 campaigned to highlight the plight of haemophiliacs infected with contaminated blood products as part of their @entity3 treatment			2
the families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the @entity3 have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time the @entity87 's coverage included telling the story of @entity202 , then 36 , a haemophiliac who contracted @entity205 through a blood clotting agent , under the headline : ' a blindness to moral justice has abandoned this dying man			1
surely his family deserves better			0
' mr @entity202 , a married father of two from @entity214 , had to give up his job as a computer systems designer because of his deteriorating health			0
the article asked : ' why does n't the government do the honourable thing about what the @entity221 describes as ' the biggest tragedy in @entity3 history ' ? ' after pressure on the government to recognise the unique circumstances of the case , 1,200 haemophiliac @entity205 victims were promised £ 42million compensation in 1990			1
regardless of whether they were taking legal action , those affected and their families got lump sums ranging from £ 21,000 to £ 60,500			0
mr @entity202 said he would accept the offer to give him ' peace of mind ' that his family would not be left penniless			0
but others said it was not enough , and accused the government of ' buying off the embarrassment ' of a court case			0
@entity82 is the only part of the @entity15 to hold an inquiry into the scandal			2
the @entity84 , which gave its findings yesterday , said 478 people acquired the hepatitis c virus from blood product therapy in @entity82 and 2,500 acquired the virus from blood transfusion in @entity82 between 1970 and 1991			1
sixty patients acquired @entity10 from therapy with blood products and 18 from blood transfusion in @entity82			1
the @entity87 's coverage included telling the story of @entity202 , then 36 , a haemophiliac who contracted @entity205 through a blood clotting agent the @entity84 did not have the power to summon witnesses from outside @entity82 – and has done little to abate the anger of many victims			1
@entity263 , of @entity264 , @entity265 , who contracted hepatitis c and @entity10 from contaminated blood he received as a child , said yesterday he had been treated as nothing more than a ' lump of meat to be experimented on '			1
he told the @entity272 that the treatment was ' so dirty and filthy , and the places it was being sourced ... anything could have been in that blood ' , adding : ' we were used as objects of research			0
' three men who contracted hepatitis c from blood transfusions have started a legal case to challenge the support available to them , and it is likely further legal action will follow .			1
