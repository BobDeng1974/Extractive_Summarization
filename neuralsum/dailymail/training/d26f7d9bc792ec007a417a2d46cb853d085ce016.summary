@entity0 today sought to quash speculation that the @entity3 ’ local election losses will trigger a challenge against @entity6 ’s leadership			1
the @entity7 said the idea of ousting the prime minister was ‘ bonkerooney ’ as defeated @entity11 councillors demanded change at the top			1
the @entity3 lost 335 seats in county and unitary council elections in @entity18 , and were pushed into third by @entity21 ’s @entity20 in the @entity22 by - election			1
education secretary @entity0 said it was ' barmy ' to talk about ousting @entity6 as @entity11 leader conservative ministers moved to promise tougher policies on immigration and @entity29 in an attempt to steady the mood in the party			1
but some of the councillors who lost their seats at the hands of @entity20 said there had to be fundamental change in the direction of the party			1
@entity11 @entity40 , who lost her seat in @entity42 , pinned the blame on the prime minister			1
' clearly the message was to the government			2
i hope the government will listen because they never do , ' she told the @entity50			0
' they are arrogant , out of touch and because of them good councillors have now been lost			2
' @entity55 , a former @entity11 councillor in @entity56 who also lost his seat said : ‘ my rock - bed supporters were absolutely fed up by coalition policy			2
’ a conservative mp told @entity61 4 : ‘ it 's time for a leadership election now			0
’ as news of @entity11 council election losses emerged , mr @entity6 was meeting scientists before opening the ' @entity67 ' at @entity68 mr @entity6 , who also visited @entity69 in his @entity71 constituency , was accused of running an ' out of touch ' government by @entity11 members but mr @entity0 said no - one in the @entity11 party should think that removing mr @entity6 from @entity76 was the solution to the party ’s problems			1
‘ i think that any of my colleagues who want to indulge in leadership speculation should spend the weekend reading the history books and consider if leadership speculation has ever helped any political party to enhance its position with the voters			0
‘ with great respect to anyone – actually , with no respect , it ’s barmy			0
the idea of changing the leader is bonkeroony			0
’ he suggested that many @entity20 voters return to the @entity11 fold when faced with the prospect of @entity98 becoming prime minister in 2015			1
‘ at the next election it ’s a straightforward choice between @entity6 and @entity98			0
‘ the second thing is that those people who are voting for @entity20 – and they have a number of concerns that we have to respectfully address - those people who are voting for @entity20 are emphatically not people who at the next general election are likely to vote for @entity98 and they have n’t been persuaded by what passes for his analysis of our current problems			2
@entity11 vice-chairman @entity114 said there had to be ' serious research ' into why voters backed @entity20 ‘ given how poorly @entity117 have done today i think there ’s every chance at the next general election that many of those who have voted for @entity20 will support the conservatives because faced with that choice between @entity6 and @entity98 , i think the majority of the people in the country will conclude that @entity6 is the right person to change @entity127 for the better			1
’ ministers are preparing to use next week 's @entity129 to set out new measures on welfare and immigration aimed at winning wooing voters who have switched to @entity20			2
new laws will be set out to curb benefits for immigrants , amid concern about the impact of the influx of @entity140 and @entity141 when movement restrictions are lifted next year			0
a bill which will limit the right of immigrants to access benefits , the @entity143 and other public services will form a centrepiece of the coalition 's programme			0
however , @entity11 vice-chairman @entity114 said the party had to carry out ‘ serious research ’ into the message @entity20 voters sent at the ballot box he tweeted : ‘ if nothing else , let us be polite to @entity20 and their supporters , eh ? ‘ i hope there will be some serious research about exactly what message @entity20 voters are giving : none - of - the - above or specific issues			1
’ mr @entity114 added ‘ life can not go on as normal ’ for the main three parties ‘ unless they have no ambition for 2015 ’			0
conservative @entity169 tweeted : ‘ we have 2years to communicate loudly that conservatives are party which will have in / out @entity172 , vetoed @entity168			0
