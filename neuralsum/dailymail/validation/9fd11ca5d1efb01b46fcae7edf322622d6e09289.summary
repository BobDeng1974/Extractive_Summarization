the @entity0 has backed @entity1 over @entity3 ’s use of the word ‘ pikey ’			1
the word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a ‘ running gag ’ between @entity3 and fellow presenter @entity12 about their colleague @entity14 ’s perceived cheap style			1
a complaint was lodged by the @entity18 charity after it appeared on a placard in a @entity1 episode from february last year			1
@entity1 hosts : the word ' pikey ' was part of a ‘ running gag ’ between @entity3 ( right ) and fellow presenter @entity12 ( left ) about the perceived cheap style of their colleague @entity14 ( centre ) the @entity28 acknowledged that the word ‘ pikey ’ derived from ‘ turnpike ’ and so related to @entity31 in a ruling due to be published today			1
but the @entity28 ’s @entity32 said there had been ‘ no intended racist reference ’ by the @entity1 team			1
the ruling stated : ‘ the committee believed the word “ pikey ” had evolved into common parlance among a number of people to mean “ chavvy ” or “ cheap ” and … viewers would not necessarily associate it with the @entity44 communities			1
’ but a @entity18 spokesman told the newspaper : ‘ we are horrified by the @entity0 ’s green - lighting of the use of the word “ pikey ” by the @entity1 presenters			1
embattled presenter : the future of @entity3 ( pictured leaving his house in @entity56 yesterday ) at the @entity0 is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in @entity60 ruling : the @entity0 committee said it ‘ accepted that the word “ pikey ” did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the @entity44 communities ’ ( file picture ) ‘ the claim that it has evolved a new meaning and that most people do not realise it has any reference at all with @entity69 and @entity31 is absolute rubbish			1
’ the word ' pikey ' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century			2
but it was not seen in print until 1837 , when @entity73 used it to describe strangers who visited the @entity76			0
the actual origins of the word are unclear			2
it could be connected to the word ' turnpike '			2
these were toll roads , which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century			0
an alternative version of the word is ' piker ' , which is said to have come from the verb ' to pike ' - which once meant to run away			2
now , the word is used as an insulting term towards gipsies - who have claimed in recent years that it is the equivalent of calling a black person a ' n * * * * * '			2
it is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class			0
the @entity0 committee said it ‘ accepted that the word “ pikey ” did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the @entity44 communities ’ , but it cleared the programme of wrongdoing			2
@entity3 ’s future at the @entity0 is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in @entity60			1
he now faces an interrogation over his row with @entity1 producer @entity115 by @entity0 chiefs , who are said to be ‘ desperate ’ to get rid of him			1
@entity118 , head of @entity119 , is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days			0
last night @entity3 was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the march edition of @entity1 magazine that foreign taxi drivers in @entity56 have ‘ vehicles smelling of sick ’			1
he also turned on drivers in the @entity60 , saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants ‘ who have never experienced tarmac before ’			0
the inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows			0
last year , @entity3 apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the n - word in the poem ‘ @entity141 , meeny , miney , moe ’			1
shortly afterwards , he used the racist term ‘ slope ’ in a show about @entity143			2
the racing driver who was @entity147 on @entity1 for eight years has said that the @entity0 show could thrive without the embattled @entity3			1
@entity149 fell out with the broadcaster when it launched legal action - which it failed to win - over his decision to reveal his identity and publish his autobiography			0
he told @entity158 magazine that the presenter was not supportive of him in his own clash with the corporation			0
and he said that the @entity163 show could continue to succeed without him			0
claim : @entity149 ( left ) , the racing driver who was @entity147 ( right ) on @entity1 for eight years , has said that the @entity0 show could thrive without the embattled @entity3 the stuntman stated : ‘ @entity1 has achieved huge status and @entity3 has certainly been part of that because he ’s got such a big personality ... he ’s an unstoppable force			1
‘ but fans of the programme love it for lots of different reasons			0
@entity3 is certainly one of them , but not the only one , ’ @entity149 , who was @entity147 until 2011 , said			1
‘ the @entity177 franchise ...			0
@entity1 will always continue ...			2
it will carry on and continue to be successful because millions of people watch it			0
’ mr @entity149 said that it had become harder for the show ‘ to reinvent itself ’ , as it was ‘ possibly starting to strain under the weight of its own success ’			0
meanwhile , @entity185 , who was @entity147 from 2002 to 2003 , said that @entity1 without @entity3 would take ‘ the fire out of it ’ and ‘ wo n’t work ’			1
‘ i think you ’re going to have a diluted product			0
i do n’t think it will have the value that it did , here and overseas ’ , he said			0
‘ and @entity191 help any soul who takes his place , because that ’s like signing up for your own firing squad			0
the only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose			0

@entity202 became part of ' running gag ' between @entity3 and @entity12
it was about their colleague @entity14 *'s* perceived cheap style
complaint lodged by @entity18 after word appeared in *epsiode*
