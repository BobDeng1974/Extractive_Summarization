by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a landmark budget agreement that passed in the @entity3 on thursday faces certain death in the @entity5 unless at least five @entity6 step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all			1
the @entity11 's @entity5 leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short - changes military veterans and other government retirees			1
senate majority whip @entity20 conceded that he needs to find republicans who will vote for the measure after @entity11 announced their intention thursday night to block the deal			1
' we need @entity11 votes to pass the budget agreement , period , ' @entity20 told reporters on thursday			1
' we need at least five			0
and i ’m hoping that there will be more than that			0
' @entity20 , an @entity34 @entity33 and the third-most powerful @entity5 leader , acknowledged that ' there are not five republicans who have announced they ’re for it			0
' in fact , no @entity11 senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that @entity11 rep. @entity11 and @entity44 sen. @entity43 unveiled tuesday evening			1
turtle in the headlights ? senate minority leader @entity47 is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the @entity3 passed easily thursday night no way , @entity52 : @entity54 senator @entity53 , a conservative tea - party darling , said the budget proposal ' spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for @entity60			1
i can not support it ' their plan would roll back $ 63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so - called budget sequester that took effect in march			1
some of that restored spending would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions			1
annual cost - of - living increases in most military veterans ' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent , an amount that the @entity75 says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor $ 80,000 over a 20 - year period			2
the @entity11 's three most senior senators , including minority leader @entity47 , have announced that they will vote ' no. ' senators @entity53 , @entity81 and @entity82 , all considered top - tier presidential contenders in 2016 , are all lined up against the measure			1
the proposal ' spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for @entity60 , ' @entity53 said thursday			0
' i can not support it			0
' gang of two : @entity90 chairman @entity11 and @entity91 chair @entity43 negotiated a shutdown - averting agreement that could be headed nowhere @entity81 emailed supporters on wednesday , saying that the agreement @entity11 and @entity95 negotiated over a six - week period ' continues @entity97 's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday @entity1			1
' house speaker @entity101 fanned the flames of a civil war inside the @entity11 by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his @entity5 colleagues decide to kill it and @entity82 said in a statement that the march sequester cuts ' were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem			1
undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed			0
' other republicans who face primary challenges from tea party - backed candidates are also vowing to cast ' no ' votes			2
' after careful review of the agreement , i believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees , ' @entity120 @entity119 sen. @entity119 said in a statement			0
' our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation ’s most troubling times			0
they deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides			0
' sen. @entity137 , a @entity138 @entity11 , echoed @entity119 's complaint			2
' i do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops , ' @entity137 's thursday statement read			2
' @entity146 should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military			2
... the plan should be rejected			0
' other republicans object to what one @entity11 @entity5 staffer told @entity158 is the agreement 's ' pixie dust approach to budgeting			2
' ' we 're doing what we always do , ' said the aide , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
' we set out a ten - year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again			0
' looking toward 2016 : sen. @entity82 said the unpopular ' sequester ' budget cuts ' were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem ' and should never be rolled back @entity173 @entity11 @entity172 explained that @entity174 will need 60 ' yes ' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it			1
the @entity11 's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of @entity5 time when the measure is considered early next week			0
even if @entity174 manage to find enough @entity11 support to pass the agreement , it wo n't have the force of law			2
what @entity11 and @entity95 proposed wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written			1
members of @entity146 who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by january 15			1
unless they can pull it off , the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months .			0

@entity146 needs to pass a new budget by january 15 to avoid another government shutdown
@entity11 rep. @entity11 and @entity44 sen. @entity43 negotiated a framework and tried to sell it to their *respective* majorities
the @entity11 - led @entity3 passed the plan thursday night despite complaints from tea *partiers* and other budget hawks
but objections from @entity6 , including a claim that the plan restores spending cuts by *shortchanging* veterans ' pensions , could kill it
