by @entity0 an exhausted leopard seal in need of a good sleep was spotted seeking refuge from the serious swell battering the @entity7 coast on monday			1
the young seal lay sprawled out in the sand on @entity10 on @entity12 's northern beaches , looking somewhat sad as he struggled to get some shut eye			1
the cute creature was seen flopped on his front with his flippers by his side and tail straight out behind it , covered in sand with his eyes closed			0
dozed off : the leopard seal took a nap on @entity10 on @entity12 's northern beaches on monday in another shot the seal had opened his eyes slightly and rolled over on to his back , baring the lighter coloured fur on his belly			1
however authorities are very concerned for the welfare of the ' underweight ' animal , who is originally from the @entity38 region south of @entity39			2
' he 's a long way from home , we 've had very very big seas over the last four to five days so the seals are getting bounced and pounded around in the waves , ' @entity40 for the @entity43 in @entity39 ( @entity42 ) vice president @entity41 told the @entity50			0
exhausted : the animal was worn out from the big seas which have been beating off the @entity7 coast officers from @entity54 and the @entity55 were at the beach keeping an eye on the seal , but he slipped back into the sea before a vet arrived to do an assessment			2
this time of year is the most common for seals to be sighted along the coast of @entity7 , but it is very rare to see leopard seals as their main habitat is in the @entity38 and sub-antarctic regions			2
' we wish that the seal could have stayed a shore so we could have had a look at it , ' ms @entity41 said			0
@entity54 is hoping the animal will reappear along the coast in the morning so they can check on its health			0
ms @entity41 also assured that the creature was not injured , but she is concerned about its survival as it is visibly underweight			0
