here ’s an amazing stat : @entity1 have kept more clean sheets this season than any of last year ’s top seven clubs			1
in fact , those seven : @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 have managed just nine clean sheets between them			1
at this stage last season , they had kept 19			2
the @entity16 is gradually becoming more like @entity17 in @entity18 ; the emphasis moving from building a solid team from the back to throwing men forward to outscore your opponents			1
@entity12 spent all their money during the summer on attacking players teams are coached to pass and commit men forward , full backs are encouraged to attack more than defend and players are asked to play with freedom			1
it ’s a far cry from the old days when the emphasis was on staying in your position and playing long balls from the back			2
the managers of those seven clubs : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 all set up their teams to attack			1
even @entity47 does that now , although he still occasionally adjusts for tough games			0
in the early part of my career , managers adopted a safety - first approach but how many teams do now ? maybe @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity1			1
top teams always played attacking football but now everybody is trying to play			2
the influence of @entity18 players like @entity64 has opened up the @entity16 @entity66 , for years associated with direct football , is using a diamond and @entity68 , another criticised for boring football , got @entity58 playing an exciting brand last season			1
we ’ve seen it in @entity18 for years , the attitude of ‘ we ’ll outscore you ’ ; that you might as well try to win three points in one match rather than run around like crazy and get three draws			1
it is more exciting for players and fans			0
obviously , defences are exposed and in the past 10 years the top seven teams in @entity17 have kept fewer clean sheets each season than their equivalents here			1
@entity9 forward @entity85 has flourished as defences are exposed when i played under @entity43 at @entity8 , if one full back went forward , the other stayed back			2
that meant we had three defenders and at least one or two midfielders ( usually @entity94 and @entity95 ) defending too			0
the rest of the team was free to attack			2
now most teams push both full backs forward , only leaving two centre - backs and a holding midfielder behind			2
it ’s not that you ca n’t defend with those seven pressing high up the pitch , it ’s the gaps left behind that are the problem			0
teams just run into the space , as @entity12 found to their cost at @entity111			0
@entity6 's @entity112 operates in the pocket just in front of the defence the @entity18 influence is clear			1
eight @entity16 managers have experience in @entity18 and only @entity1 , @entity119 , @entity58 , @entity120 and @entity111 have n’t had a manager who has played or managed there			1
it was only a matter of time before our game opened up			1
i imagine that around 90 per cent of the emphasis in training concerns the final third			0
the position of maximum opportunity ( @entity132 ) used to be at the back post			0
now , with many teams playing a diamond , the @entity132 is that pocket in front of the defence where @entity141 , @entity64 , @entity85 and @entity112 operate			0
even crossers of the ball such as @entity144 are finding success there			0
teams are more innovative and imaginative than ever			0
who cares if we lose a few clean sheets in the process ? tackle @entity152 @entity153 via email asks : will you be watching the @entity156 this weekend ? are you much of a golfer ? @entity158 says : try to stop me ! the @entity156 is the reason i got @entity162 tv all those years ago			1
it will be so close this weekend but after the miracle of @entity165 , you wonder how often @entity166 can dig out performances like that			0
i ’d love to get on the course more than i do but i did n’t play golf as a footballer because it affected my back			0
at @entity173 and @entity174 ( right ) were probably the best two but you always had to keep an eye out for @entity177			0
he was a bit of a handicap bandit !			0

@entity181 has moved from building a solid team from the back to throwing men forward to outscore your opponents
@entity1 have kept more clean sheets ( three ) this season than any of last year 's top seven clubs
eight @entity16 managers have experience in @entity18 and it was only a matter of time before our game opened up
