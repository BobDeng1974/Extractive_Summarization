when police officers in minority report predicted who would commit crimes , and stopped them before they happened , it was considered so futuristic the film was set in 2054			1
but , police in @entity8 are considering adopting a similar software that predicts crimes and is named ‘ @entity11 ’ - in a nod to the sci - fi film			1
other forces , including police officers in two @entity17 states and @entity19 ’s @entity18 are also trialling predictive systems to catch would - be criminals			2
when police officers in the @entity2 ( pictured ) predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they happened , it was considered so futuristic the film was set in 2054			1
but , police in @entity8 are considering adopting similar software that predicts crimes , and is named ‘ @entity11 ’ in a nod to the sci - fi film developed by a @entity33 firm , the software program predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur , based on different sets of data			1
it is being tested by police in the southern state of @entity41			0
‘ the @entity8 police is first waiting for the results of the trial run in @entity41 ’ before deciding on on whether to acquire @entity11 , a spokesman said			1
the name is a contraction of ‘ @entity47 ’			2
the ‘ @entity11 ’ title borrows deliberately from the ‘ precog ’ term used in minority report referring to three psychics who predict crimes before they happen			1
developed by a @entity33 firm , the software program predicts when and where a crime is most likely to occur , based on different sets of data			1
it is being tested by police in the southern state of @entity41			0
a stock image of a @entity33 police officer wearing protective clothing is pictured last year , law enforcers in two @entity17 states used crime - prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder , and supervised them accordingly			1
instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records , the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them			0
the minority report - style software is already being used in @entity77 and @entity78 to predict future murderers			2
it has been developed by professor @entity81 , a criminologist at the @entity82 , who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes			0
professor @entity81 says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future			0
it could also be modified to predict lesser crimes			0
the 2002 movie starring @entity95 and directed by @entity96 was based on a story by @entity98			0
the @entity33 @entity11 system relies on data of the location , time and other details of past crimes , such as home break - ins			1
when a new incident is reported , the software analyses the data to look for a pattern that will point to a future target			1
it was developed by the institute for pattern - based @entity112 in @entity113			0
the initial results from tests on burglaries in the @entity41 cities of @entity121 and @entity122 are ‘ promising ’ , the state 's interior minister @entity114 said in a progress report last month			2
but a civil rights activist voiced concern in tuesday 's @entity125 that personal data could eventually be used , instead of the currently anonymous information			1
two months ago , @entity19 's @entity18 announced it has tested a system that analyses a person 's criminal history , and posts on social media , to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime			0
the 20 - week pilot study , which is the first of its kind in the @entity138 , combined data from different crime reporting and crime intelligence systems used by the @entity18 to pinpoint gang members who are more likely to commit violent crimes			1
developed by global consulting group , @entity145 , the latest software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across @entity19 's 32 boroughs across a four year period			2
police then compared the software 's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year to test its accuracy , but they are keeping quiet about the results			2
in @entity161 , authorities are undertaking a @entity163 initiative that combines electronic vision technologies and predictive analytics into @entity167 video feeds to detect street incidents			0
other forces , including police officers in two @entity17 states and @entity19 ’s @entity18 are also trialling predictive systems to catch criminals			0
a stock image of @entity175 is pictured			0

police in @entity8 are trialling software that predicts crimes using old data
the name of the ‘ @entity11 ’ program is *inspired* by the film @entity2
in the film , psychics called ' precogs ' have visions about future crimes
the @entity33 program predicts when and where crime is likely to occur
but , a civil rights activist voiced concern that personal data could eventually be used , instead of the currently anonymous information
