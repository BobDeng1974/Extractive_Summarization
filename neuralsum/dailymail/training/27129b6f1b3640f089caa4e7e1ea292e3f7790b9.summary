by @entity0 and @entity1 one of the models whose account of an encounter with @entity6 appears in @entity8 's controversial profile piece on the photographer has decided to set the record straight on what really happened that day			1
in @entity15 's cover story , model @entity12 , is portrayed as a somewhat naive teenage model , who ' laughs ' when @entity6 presents his penis to her during a photo - shoot and is asked to ' twist and squeeze it really hard '			1
in a written response made public on monday , @entity12 refutes this account of the session which happened when she was 19 , describing instead @entity6 's nudity as ambush - like and even more disturbingly says the ' experience was not consensual			1
it was revolting and humiliating			2
' she even goes on to describe him as a ' poor sick man			0
' scroll down for @entity30 setting the record straight : @entity32 has written a strong denial regarding the circumstances of her photo shoot with @entity6 when she was 19 - years - old fashion photographer @entity6 , 48 , used the @entity8 piece published this week to vehemently deny all accusations of inappropriate conduct during his photo shoots , saying the pictures were taken as part of collaborations by those involved who were ' exploring sexuality			1
' indeed , a source close to @entity6 told @entity48 that despite the email they received from @entity12 , she instigated the sexual encounter and that the shoot was not her last with the photographer , nor was it the last time they took sexual pictures together			1
however , in her strongly worded rebuttal of the interview and @entity6 's behavior , @entity12 , now a mother of two , recounts a very different story from the @entity8 piece			1
controversial : the cover piece for the latest edition of @entity8 has infuriated one of the models mentioned who claim to be one of @entity6 's alleged victims while @entity15 writes that she was unaware of @entity6 's reputation for producing ' risqu√© ' work , @entity12 claims that she ' completely taken off guard			1
' ' i was not warned that i would be expected to pose nude of engage in any sexual activity at the casting			0
' while @entity12 does not deny at any point that she did grab @entity6 's penis and posed for pictures like this , she is adamant that she ' did not instigate the penis twisting , nudity or any kind of sexual touching			1
' while @entity15 writes that @entity12 ultimately found the experience ' weird ' , the model instead writes she found it ' humiliating '			0
@entity12 admits that there is merit to the argument @entity15 frames of @entity6 as an artist or a predator			2
but her email to @entity48 claims that ' what the article does not make clear is that @entity6 's sexual escapades go way beyond artistic ' boundary pushing ' and involve serious sexual harassment and abuse of young models in the workplace			1
' @entity12 contends that she was ' abused ' by @entity6 and labels him a ' poor sick man			2
' in one heartbreaking section of her email , @entity12 outlines the hurt caused by the source close to @entity6 who claimed she instigated the touching			2
' this is a flat - out lie			0
i remember going home after the casting and crying hysterically , unable to tell my boyfriend why i was upset and unwilling to share with him that i had been coerced into this bizarre sex act at work , ' writes @entity12			0

' recently in an e-mail to @entity153 , a @entity8 - based writer and stylist named @entity156 claimed that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home , where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her ' tits ' while he posed next to her			2
he then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor , and ' suddenly , i felt a d * * * pressing into the side of my face , ' she reveals			0
' he pressed it to my lips			0
he clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera			0
' she described the horrifying moment when she realized @entity6 , who was 43 at the time , was pressing himself against her while his assistant giggled and snapped photos			2
' i did n't want to act scared or angry because i was in this guy 's apartment with no one else around aside from his equally screwed - up assistant and who knows what these psychos were capable of , ' she wrote			0
location : a stylist and writer named @entity156 says she was at a launch party for @entity189 ( pictured ) in @entity190 in 2008 when @entity6 's assistant @entity191 asked her to come to his apartment for a shoot @entity156 said @entity6 , who was 43 at the time , ' pressed his d * * * against her face ' while his assistant ( pictured ) giggled and snapped photos @entity156 said she was has n't revealed her story until now because she thought no one would care about a ' non-model ' being sexually assaulted , especially without any solid proof			2
but she was finally prompted to open up after hearing recent reports that @entity8 is planning on doing a cover story absolving @entity6 of the multiple sexual assault accusations he has faced over the years			1
' the guy should n't just be locked out from the fashion photography world , he should be in jail , ' she stated			0
' add another girl to the list ! ' @entity6 , 48 , has strongly denied previous accusations - mostly from models he has worked with - that he has acted inappropriately towards them			1
in a letter obtained by @entity213 in march , he called the allegations ' lies ' and said the claims were nothing more than an ' emotionally - charged witch - hunt '			2
popular guy : despite the numerous accusations against him , mostly from models he has snapped , @entity6 continues to be one of the mot sought - after fashion photographers ( left with @entity225 , and right with @entity226 ) ' people have become comfortable concocting hate - filled and libelous tales , ' he said			1
' in writing this , i make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors			0
without my voice , all that remain are the lies			0
' allegations against @entity6 have come from high profile celebrities and actresses , as well younger , more anonymous models , but most have been incredibly damning of his conduct towards the women he works with			1
supermodel @entity244 told @entity246 magazine in july 2010 : ' i 've shot with [ @entity6 ] but i did n't feel comfortable and i wo n't do it again			0
' and @entity248 model @entity247 said that the girls who work with @entity6 ' are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves			0
