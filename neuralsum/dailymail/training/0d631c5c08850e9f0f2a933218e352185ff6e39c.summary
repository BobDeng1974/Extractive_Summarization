by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 18 march 2014 updated : 15:04 est , 18 march 2014 a former @entity4 mayor is accused of major tax evasion and newly unsealed documents revealed monday that the politician , whose wife is facing charges along with him , allegedly used illicit funds to keep a mistress			1
@entity12 was once top dog at the city of @entity15 , @entity4 's sixth largest , but now faces possible jail time in part for allegedly loaning his convicted @entity19 schemer friend $ 850,000 and then taking over $ 300,000 in secret cash interest payments with no cut for @entity22			1
and no cut for his wife @entity25 , it appears , though she 's remained by her husband 's side nonetheless			2
she stayed with him : the ex-mayor of one of @entity4 's biggest cities , @entity15 in @entity32 , is on trial with his wife for alleged tax evasion			1
but @entity12 , left , may have been hiding money from his wife @entity37 ( right ) in order to pay to keep a mistress it 's just part of what prosecutors say was over $ 1 million in ' shadow banking ' profits delivered to @entity25			1
and while the state attorneys have urged @entity25 -- who they do n't believe was a direct recipient of the untaxed cash -- to get her own attorney , she has refused			0
which comes as a surprise after the @entity52 revealed monday that @entity25 was spending the money on a mistress and needed to keep it below board so his wife would n't find out			2
' the government expects its evidence to show that the cash interest payments were delivered to defendant @entity12 , rather than defendant @entity62 , ' read the newly unsealed documents			0
dirt deeds ? @entity25 and his wife are accused of hiding $ 1 million from the government			1
documents unsealed monday reveal @entity25 is accused of taking cash from his debtors in order to keep a mistress and hide it from his wife this fresh twist in the @entity25 's saga revolves around their alleged involvement with @entity80 , who 's now serving 10 years after pleading guilty to running a $ 45 million jewelry investment @entity81			2
according to the @entity52 , prosecutors say @entity80 agreed to pay the couple 18 percent interest on over $ 850,000			0
but they say the arrangement was with he former mayor and not his wife , because the $ 300,000 or so he made from @entity80 helped him keep an unnamed mistress on the side			1
meanwhile , it 's mrs. @entity25 who 'll be standing alonside her husband at the april 10 trial			0
' we feel an obligation to notify the court and defense counsel of this difference between the two defendants , ' the prosecutor said in a closed - door hearing in february			0
despite urgings from the prosecutors over her conflict of interest , @entity25 continues to retain the same attorney as her husband in the case			0
meanwhile , the alleged dealings with @entity80 are n't the only misdeeds the couple is accused of			0
the may 2013 indictment alleges that @entity25 and his wife avoided paying their full share of taxes and instead used the money to purchase two @entity32 beach condominiums and a @entity117 sports car			1
the @entity118 , @entity119 - born @entity25 , a @entity120 , was first elected mayor of @entity15 in 2005 and elected to a second term in 2009			1
he stepped down in 2011 to launch a losing bid for mayor of @entity32 , a year after the @entity126 had begun investigating his personal finances			2
@entity15 , a blue - collar and predominantly @entity131 - @entity130 district , is better known for its ubiquitous warehouses than for its once regal @entity135 race track			0
one of @entity4 's biggest cities , it has a long history of graft and corruption and former mayor @entity141 , who died in office in 1974 after 27 years in power , survived numerous scandals , including a grand larceny conviction			0
more recently , in the 1980s and ' 90s , @entity131 - born @entity146 , a longtime @entity15 mayor , won re-election despite a federal influence - peddling indictment and two hung juries .			2

prosecutors allege former @entity15 , @entity4 mayor @entity12 accepted some $ 300,000 under the table from his now - jailed friend @entity153
@entity25 , who *unsuccessfully* ran for @entity32 mayor in 2011 , and his wife now face charges for *conspiring* to evade paying income tax
