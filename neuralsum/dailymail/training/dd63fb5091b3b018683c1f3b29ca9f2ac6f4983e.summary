@entity0 revels in hostility , he says , which is fortunate because his first derby against @entity4 is swiftly followed by a @entity6 tie against @entity7 and a clash with @entity9 , the club he quit for @entity11			1
it promises to be a testing week for the new @entity11 boss and he is arming himself with memories of success playing for @entity17 in the home of their fierce rivals , @entity19			1
‘ it was difficult to leave the stadium , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was difficult to arrive , as well			2
we had all the windows closed and everyone was lying on the floor			2
in the dressing room and on the coach , the windows were broken			2
you need to be brave in @entity19 if you play for @entity17			2
’ @entity11 boss @entity0 believes he is ready for saturday 's north @entity34 derby @entity4 captain @entity35 used to play alongside @entity0 during his time at @entity17 @entity35 has spoken of the hostile reception @entity17 used to receive at the @entity38 @entity4 captain @entity35 played in one of those games alongside @entity0 and told how @entity17 boss @entity41 became the touchline target for a barrage of missiles from the home crowd at the @entity38 , including radios , mobile phones and golf balls			1
‘ he picked up one phone and held it to his ear and said “ @entity53 ” , ’ said @entity35 , another veteran of the world ’s hottest rivalries			2
the @entity4 captain has witnessed derby day in @entity56 and @entity57 , as well as in the @entity58			1
after @entity0 ’s early career in @entity62 , however , a trip into @entity60 should hold no fears			2
while playing for @entity66 in the @entity68 semi-final in the @entity70 city of @entity71 , his team - mate @entity64 , who is now the manager of @entity65 , left the pitch with blood pouring from a wound on his head after being hit by a battery			1
@entity0 played at @entity17 for two years after moving to the @entity78 capital from @entity80 outfit @entity79 both sides will be hoping they can do their talking on the pitch rather than being involved in confrontations @entity4 winger @entity84 wound up @entity11 fans in january while being carried off on a stretcher @entity0 claimed he would be happy to assume a familiar position on the floor of the team bus on the way to the @entity91			1
‘ it is not strange for me , ’ he smiled , but he was not joking when he added : ‘ i am stronger in the hostile situation			2
’ fortunately , the north @entity34 derby rarely reaches such extreme levels , but it has been an uncomfortable ride for @entity11 managers in recent years			1
including @entity100 , who was caretaker for most of the 2003 - 4 season , @entity0 is @entity11 ’ 12th manager since @entity103 arrived at @entity4			1
the others , for the record , are @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			2
if he finds the instability amusing , @entity103 managed to disguise it on friday , insisting his personal hold over @entity11 ( he has lost only six of 43 ) is not important compared to the wider picture of finishing in the top four			1
‘ i honestly do not look at the satisfaction of my job by comparing it to @entity11 , ’ said @entity103			1
‘ i am more proud to achieve our targets every year			2
that was to be in the @entity128 — apart from that most of the time to be in the @entity128 , one of our rivals was @entity11			1
for many years it was them or us and we always managed to get above them			0
’ what is wrong with @entity4 ... it 's been a bit of a mixed bag this season and they are inconsistent			1
injuries have not helped and @entity103 still has to work out his best xi. the solution ... once @entity103 cracks the code , they can produce big things this season			0
what is wrong with @entity11 ... with three managers in less than a year , there has to be some sympathy for the players			1
that lack of stability is affecting the performances			0
the solution ... @entity0 has to see who in the squad can cut it			0
bust must do so quickly			0
he did , however , accept that fulfilling those ambitions was never harder than during the years when his club were locked into the process of building a new stadium , a project @entity11 are about to embark upon			1
‘ it is massively difficult , ’ said @entity103			0
‘ if you look at the history of all the @entity173 clubs who have built a new stadium and look at where they have finished , then it tells you how difficult it is ... when we were in a position where we had to be in the @entity128 just financially and you get into march / april and you are not , that is extremely difficult			0
‘ the stress is terrible , because you feel the future of the club is at stake and you have not a lot of margin			0
every point you lose can be dramatic			0
’ asked how @entity11 might cope , @entity103 said : ‘ it depends what kind of financial potential they have			1
it looks like they want to sell the club			0
if an owner comes in , and puts down £ 400million to buy the stadium , it is easy			0
‘ the way we did it is the hardest way , because we had no outside financial help			0
we had to negotiate with the banks just to get the money at the start			0
let ’s not forget we paid £ 120m just for the ground , we contributed to build a rubbish centre at @entity60			0
‘ we had a lot of financial problems			0
in the end , we built the stadium for £ 400m			0
today it would cost £ 600m or £ 700m			0

@entity11 travel to the @entity91 to face @entity4 on saturday evening
@entity213 will be involved in his first north @entity34 derby since taking over the reins at @entity216
the @entity218 believes playing in @entity78 and @entity218 has prepared him for such derby matches
