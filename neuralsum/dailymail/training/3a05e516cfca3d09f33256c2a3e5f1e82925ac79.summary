a new winter misery index confirms what many @entity1 in the @entity3 and @entity4 know in their all - too - chilled bones : this has been one of the harshest winters of our lifetimes			1
and nowhere has been hit harder , relatively , than @entity10			0
sure @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15 , are in the midst of their third most extreme winters in more than 60 years			1
but @entity10 , a city that is trying to crawl out of bankruptcy , is also slogging through what so far is the most extreme winter it has had since @entity22 was president , at least , according to a winter extremity index created by a @entity25 meteorologist @entity24			1
freezing : temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the @entity3 as the @entity28 returns for a third round of severe arctic weather			1
wednesday forecast : the eastern two - thirds of the @entity1 is expected to see below - average temperatures this week after january averages were found to have been well below normal brutal : cars with their high beams on drive slowly through the powdery snow in @entity37 , @entity38 the index is based on cold temperatures and snowfall			1
and so far @entity10 has had more than 6 1/2 feet of snow and 100 days when the thermometer plunged below the freezing mark			0
of two dozen cities studied , @entity10 alone is in the middle of its harshest winter since 1950			0
@entity24 , a former @entity10 - area resident who now works in @entity48 , @entity49 , created the index a couple years ago to judge the severity of winters			1
@entity48 , by the way , is the only city in two dozen metro areas that @entity24 examined that is not having an ' extreme ' or ' severe ' winter			1
@entity24 uses daily high and low temperatures and daily and accumulated snowfall to come up with a winter index that 's equivalent to the way meteorologists categorize hurricanes and tornadoes			2
officially , it is called the @entity64			0
' i personally would call this a misery index , ' said @entity24			2
not so high : northern parts of the @entity1 will reach highs of 0 degrees brutal : the arctic blast will plunge temperatures in @entity72 and @entity73 into single digits @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 are in the midst of their fourth harshest winters			1
also having top - 10 harshest winters are @entity83 - @entity82 in @entity84 ; @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87 , @entity88 , and @entity89 , @entity38 the idea is to put winter in context			1
this winter seems unusually harsh because it has been a while since the late 1970s and early 1980s when severe winters were far more frequent			2
plus , for almost three - quarters of the places studied the winter of 2011 - 2012 was the mildest on record , @entity24 said			2
but why @entity10 ? just bad geography and luck			0
much of the cold and snow this winter is because of a change in the jet stream that has funneled frigid air south from the @entity107 ' right down the alley ' through @entity10 , @entity101 said			0
here we again : @entity110 digs through a foot of snow to create a path to her @entity115 home the winter index keeps going , until the cold , snowy weather stops			0
and that 's at least a couple weeks away , according to forecasts			0
' we 're going to push that index a little bit higher , ' @entity24 said			0
' let 's see how much higher we can go			0
' the relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic - related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years			0
@entity1 airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since december 1 , including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987 - 1988 , when records began			2
condition of the job : a @entity141 member and his dog stand post in the falling snow on the @entity145 of the @entity146 in @entity147 yesterday battling through : @entity148 and @entity149 leave the grave of their son @entity153 lt. j.g			0
@entity154 after placing flowers during a snow fall yesterday still smiling : not even the driving snow could dampen the spirits of this fashionista attending the @entity160 show in @entity75 last week meanwhile , temperatures are set to drop up to 30 degrees below normal mid-week across the @entity3 as the @entity28 returns for a third round of severe arctic weather			1
the arctic blast will head east plunging temperatures in @entity72 and @entity73 into single digits			1
even the @entity168 will experience temperatures below freezing , according to the @entity25 ( @entity25 )			1
the @entity25 said it will not be as severe as the first @entity28 to hit the @entity1 in january but described it as ' a cold mass of arctic air			1
' cities including @entity75 to @entity11 , @entity83 , @entity10 and @entity147 had all been enjoying temperatures in the 50s last weekend			1
the @entity3 and @entity4 were thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the past week , but forecasters have warned it wo n't be for long as another cold front is on its way			0
the eastern two - thirds of the @entity1 is expected to see below - average temperatures this week after january averages were found to have been well below normal according to a to a monthly climate report by the @entity185			2
the cold spell comes from the northern polar vortex , a high - altitude flow of air that circles west to east above the @entity190			2
resilient : pedestrians get little protection from the elements under their tiny umbrellas in @entity195 , @entity75			0

winter extremity index created by @entity25 meteorologist @entity24
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 experiencing third most extreme winters in more than 60 years
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 in their fourth harshest winters
in the top 10 are @entity83 - @entity82 in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity89 , @entity38
polar vortex returned mid-week plunging temperatures in @entity72 and @entity73 into single digits
even the @entity168 will experience temperatures below freezing , according to the @entity25
it will not be as severe as the first @entity28 to hit the @entity1
