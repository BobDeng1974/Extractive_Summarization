it was a fishing trip with a very big catch – namely the £ 9 homemade rowing boat in which the two anglers ventured out on to the open sea			1
built with discarded scraps from house conversions including loft insulation board and polystyrene , it was glued together with silicone sealant			0
amazingly , the 6ft vessel held together long enough for the men to set up their rods and haul in some fish			2
but they were scuppered when an oar snapped 200 yards off @entity18 , @entity19 , and they had to call 999			2
the bungling fishermen who had to be rescued from their @entity23 boat , who have been named as @entity25 , right , and @entity26 , left the @entity23 boat used by a pair of fisherman , who had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew			1
the men cobbled it together using insulation boards , scrap plywood , laminate flooring , coat hangers and silicone glue the anglers had already taken the boat out to sea the day before their rescue without any problems			1
they got the materials to build the boat for free and spent £ 9 on silicone glue to hold the boat together a lifeboat crew arrived to find neither man wearing a lifejacket , and one unable to swim			1
despite the experience , one of the men yesterday pledged to return to the water with another homemade boat			1
@entity26 , 27 , a self - employed builder , said : ‘ i ’m already thinking about doing it again but next time i ’ll get a little engine instead of oars			2
‘ the boat itself was solid – it was waterproof			2
we took it out the day before and we were in it for two or three hours and it floated , no problem			0
the long and the short of it is that this time one of the oars snapped			1
they were proper oars but one snapped at the join so we were stranded with only one oar			1
‘ i only called 999 as i was worried for my mate as he ca n’t swim			0
he was panicking and shaking because it was cold , so i was more concerned for his safety than my own			0
‘ if it was just me out there i would have tried to swim to shore			2
what ’s the worst that could happen ? i would have drowned			0
’ the boat was put together by mr @entity26 ’s friend @entity25 , who scavenged 4in - thick insulation board , polystyrene and scrap wood			1
the @entity23 boat during its construction			1
the pair used scrap wood that they had found and spent just £ 9 buying silicone adhesive as well as using scraps of wood , the pair also made a @entity23 anchor using a 15 metre rope and a lump of scrap iron after rescuing the men , who were found without lifejackets the @entity100 crew had to bring the boat to the shore after the rescue , @entity100 returned the fishing equipment to the pair before they destroyed the unseaworthy boat one of the men , named as @entity26 , who had to be rescued coathanger wire was used to make the rowlocks , the rings on either side of the boat that provide the pivot for the oars			1
the only outlay was £ 9 on the sealant to glue and waterproof the craft			2
mr @entity25 , who is also in his 20s , refused to comment yesterday			0
but mr @entity26 added : ‘ we ’re just two lads who were bored and wanted to make a boat – why not ? it ’s better than going out and doing drugs and committing crime			0
' obviously i said thanks to the lifeguards and sorry for being a bit of an idiot and going out with no safety gear			0
‘ i was quite calm as i ’d already been in that situation before so i knew what to do			0
‘ in about 2006 me and a few mates bought a rubber dinghy and got p * * * * * up as we wanted to see how far we could get out before needing to be rescued			0
’ the pair , from @entity18 , lost their anchor , made from scrap iron , in the rescue			1
but they did come home with a dogfish , two cod and three crabs			0
@entity147 , of @entity100 , said the lifeboat crew had been stunned by the men ’s stupidity			1
the boat was destroyed .			0

two men had made the @entity23 boat at their home using scrap wood and glue
but the pair became stranded from the shore after their oars snapped
rescuers were stunned to see a homemade boat being taken out to sea
