by @entity0 published : 22:48 est , 23 february 2014 @entity2 : 05:40 est , 24 february 2014 @entity3 was introduced by @entity5 prime minister @entity4 @entity6 is backing a bid to change the name of @entity3 to ‘ earnings tax ’			1
@entity11 mp @entity10 will introduce a @entity12 tomorrow to rename the century - old levy on the grounds that it has become misleading			0
@entity3 was introduced by @entity5 prime minister @entity4 in 1913 to pay for state pensions and other benefits			1
but it has been decades since national insurance funds went solely to pay for the welfare state , leading to the charge that it has become just a hidden form of @entity23			1
the chancellor is understood to be ‘ attracted to the idea ’ of renaming @entity3 , having previously called for a review of whether it should simply be amalgamated with @entity23			1
but mr @entity6 has not yet made that move fearing voters would be alarmed to see their headline tax rates rise			1
mr @entity10 said he was campaigning for the change in order to encourage transparency in the tax system			2
he said : ‘ i am very pleased the government is interested in the idea			0
' they have been very receptive to trying to make the tax system more transparent			2
‘ this would be a really good step forward in making what the government takes from taxpayers clearer and simpler			0
the chancellor is understood to be ' attracted to the idea ' of renaming @entity3 ‘ the most important part is changing the name so in the public mind we can begin the two as the same , which they are			2
this is a first step			0
’ the government has previously resisted changing the name since focus groups have shown that elderly voters still believe national insurance funds pensions and the @entity57 and would be horrified if it were abolished , even in name alone			2
national insurance rakes in billions every year for the @entity61			0
workers earning between £ 149 and £ 797 a week pay 12 per cent of that income in @entity3			1
a further 2 per cent is paid on all earnings over that level			0
that means many taxpayers are effectively paying 2 per cent extra in income tax , raising the higher rate to 42p in the pound and the top rate to 47p			0
critics say @entity3 is particularly pernicious because , unlike income tax , mps are not allowed to vote on whether it should be levied every year			1
instead they are only asked to approve level of the charge .			0

@entity6 backs bid to change @entity3 to ' earnings tax '
@entity3 introduced by @entity5 prime minister @entity4 in 1913
was *originally* intended to pay for state pensions and other benefits
