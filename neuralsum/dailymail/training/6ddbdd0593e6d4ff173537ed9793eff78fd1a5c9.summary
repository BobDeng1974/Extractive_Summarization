hive : @entity8 , 45 , was shocked to discover a swarm of 15,000 bees were using his boiler as their hive mr @entity8 , who immediately fled the office after being stung , was forced to call on local beekeeper @entity23 , 41 , and his 39 - year - old wife , @entity24 , to tackle the infestation			1
donning protective white suits and parcel tape around their wrists and ankles , the couple managed to safely remove the colony by encouraging them into a nucleus box			1
today , mr @entity8 , who runs the heating engineering firm @entity34 , said he had not noticed the bees ' buzzing because the boiler in his office 's kitchen area had ' sealed in ' the noise			1
' i was standing next to the boiler when it was opened , ' he said			0

infestation : mr @entity8 called a local workman when his central heating system at his company 's office stopped working			1
but after opening up the boiler , the pair were stunned to find it was infested with bees removal : local beekeeper @entity23 , 41 , and his wife , @entity24 , 39 were called upon to remove the insects ' it is a new boiler and all the noise is sealed in so i did n't hear any buzzing or anything like that			1
' we are an engineering firm as well so you can imagine there is a lot of noise			0
' mr @entity8 added that the swarm of insects had destroyed his £ 2,000 boiler , which he might have to pay for out of his own pocket			1
' we are not covered by our insurers on this because it is an " insect infestation " , ' he said			0
' it was a new boiler and cost about £ 2,000 but hopefully we wo n't have to pay that out again			0
' office : mr @entity8 , who runs the heating engineering firm @entity34 ( pictured ) in @entity13 , @entity14 , said he had not noticed the bees ' buzzing because the boiler in his office 's kitchen area had ' sealed in ' the noise taking them away : mr @entity23 tips some of the insects into a box , while hundreds of others are on the floor mrs @entity86 who had passed a beekeeping course just a week before the infestation was discovered , said the swarm of bees had likely entered the boiler through an outside vent			1
' there is a vent at the back of the boiler that goes outside and that must be how they managed to get in , ' she said			2
' i asked for a bit of advice from more experienced beekeepers			0
they advised that we cut out the comb from inside the boiler and encourage the bees to move away			2
' fortunately , we were able to attract the vast majority into a nucleus box and they are now sitting happily in our garden waiting to be transferred to their new hive			2
' they had basically made their own hive			0
they were happy there until we came and got them out			0
' having a suit on and parcel tape around my ankles and wrists gives you that little sense of bravery			0
' she added that after she and her husband had left @entity130 , staff had been left with a huge clean - up job on their hands			0
' there was a lot of honey in there so it was a bit of a sticky job , ' she said .			0
