fifteen years ago , @entity3 ' shimmering , navel - baring @entity1 gown captivated the world fifteen years ago , @entity3 ' shimmering , navel - baring @entity1 gown captivated the world			0
so much so that , long before @entity7 was breaking the internet , @entity3 's 2000 red carpet appearance set the web ablaze			0
it even caught the attention of @entity13 executive , @entity12 , who has revealed that the plunging dress was his inspiration for creating @entity16			1
' when @entity13 was launched , people were amazed that they were able to find out about almost anything by typing just a few words into a computer , ' he told project - syndicate.com			1
@entity13 co-founders @entity23 and @entity24 – like all other successful inventors – kept iterating , said @entity12			1
they started with images , because people wanted more than just text			1
' this first became apparent after the @entity29 , where @entity3 wore a green dress that , well , caught the world 's attention , ' added @entity12			1
' at the time , it was the most popular search query we had ever seen			1
' but we had no surefire way of getting users exactly what they wanted : @entity3 wearing that dress			1
' before @entity16 , web surfers could only search through a page of text divided by 10 blue links			1
this meant they first had to click on these links before finding out if @entity3 's dress was featured			2
when @entity16 was launched in july 2001 , the site offered access to 250 million images			0
just ten year later , that figure reached more than 10 billion			0
the dress is one of the few articles of specific clothing to be honoured its own wikipedia page			0
after hearing the news , the 45 - year - old singer shared an old picture of her in that dress on @entity60			1
she added : ' who knew ! ! # onepersoncanchangetheworld # onedresscanchangetheworld # jlo + versace = history # positivechange # funfacts lol ' the dress caught the attention of @entity13 executive , @entity12 ( pictured ) , who recently revealed that it was his inspiration for creating @entity16 @entity13 has big plans for its image search			1
a team of @entity13 researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called @entity73 , which is twice as effective than previous programs			2
it is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image , and it can also determine an object within , or on top of , an object , within the photo			0
the software recently placed first in the @entity85 large - scale visual recognition challenge ( @entity86 )			0
@entity13 has made the software open to other developers , to help increase its accuracy , and in the future , the technology could be used to improve @entity16 searches			2
it could also scour @entity94 videos for specific objects or shapes			0
he may have helped to build the internet , but dr @entity99 has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs , or risk losing them			0
the @entity13 vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated , documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible			2
he went on to say that our dependence on technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history , with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital ' black hole '			0
in centuries to come , future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the @entity122 period in @entity123 about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records			0
dr @entity99 , who also has the title of @entity129 at @entity13 , said : ‘ if we ’re thinking 1,000 years , 3,000 years ahead in the future , we have to ask ourselves , how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create ? ‘ we are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it			2

the now 45 - year - old singer wore the dress at the @entity29
' it was the most popular search query we had ever seen , ' said @entity12
it inspired @entity13 to launch @entity146 so people could find it easier
previously users had to search through pages of text broken up by links
