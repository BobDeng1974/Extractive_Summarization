by @entity0 a @entity2 witch doctor who conned her ' patients ' out of £ 1million to become one of the most prolific conwomen in history has been jailed for 10 years			1
@entity8 , 59 , persuaded 11 clients to hand over their life savings - which she insisted would be hung from a magic tree in the @entity12 as a sacrifice			1
instead she spent the cash on first class flights , antique furniture and a £ 3,000 @entity18 handbag			0
' pure evil ' : @entity8 told one client that a relative would die if she did not continue giving her money jailed : @entity8 has been described as one of @entity2 's most prolific conwomen in history bizarrely , she would buy designer goods she never used and rent luxury homes which she never visited			1
today @entity8 was jailed for 10 years at @entity28 , where police claimed she was every bit as dangerous as a violent criminal			1
judge @entity32 said she had cast a ' spell ' over her victims - who had cancer , disabilities , sick relatives , job worries and fertility problems - persuading them to hand over the money or face ' terrifying ' consequences including the death of their loved ones			1
a jury took just an hour to convict her of 23 counts of fraud and obtaining property by deception , spanning 12 years from 1998 to 2010			1
the self - proclaimed healer said she had helped cure @entity54 ’s daughter of cancer , boasted of knowing princess @entity56 and claimed she could introduce a young singer to @entity58			1
advertising her services in @entity61 magazine , she charged just £ 35 for a consultation but then demanded huge sums to be used as the ' sacrifices ' in @entity65 , @entity66			0
there she claimed two other shamans would perform rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims ' problems resolved - but the money was never returned			1
in one especially horrifying case , a client handed over £ 176,000 in a desperate bid to fall pregnant			0
the witch doctor of @entity79 : the 59 - year - old spent the money on luxury goods she never used when she finally conceived , @entity8 told her to have an abortion because her foetus would be grossly deformed and ‘ evil ’			1
her lies were finally uncovered , along with ‘ voodoo black magic ’ which included freezers stuffed with rotting meat and an abandoned capuchin monkey which was later adopted by @entity90			1
judge @entity91 told her today : ' it is the worst case of confidence fraud i have ever had to deal with or indeed that i have ever heard of			2
' the most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed			0
' you told a number of victims the money would be returned			2
the reality , as it has emerged , is that you did n’t send any of this money to @entity66			2
you used the cash for your own purposes			0
' you cheated each and every one of these victims			0
you were able to exercise a considerable influence and indeed a spell over these victims			0
' a number of victims were ' subjugated ' to her will so that they ' lost all of their autonomy ' and became ' entirely dependent ' on her , he said			0
' to reinforce their dependence on you , you initially saw to it that they were cut off from their friends and family , ' he added			0
' you warned them about the " evil temperament " of the people to whom they were close			2
' many victims were left in financial ruin , with one man ' as poor as a church mouse ' , while the conwoman ' remorselessly extracted ' more than £ 200,000 from an elderly woman over several years			2
the official amount she defrauded was £ 908,400 , but on the evidence given by victims the final sum was closer to £ 1million			0
police believe the total taken by @entity8 - who had similar previous convictions - could be higher still			1
@entity149 ’s web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes which aroused her victims ’ suspicions			0
she claimed to have attended @entity155 ’s college , @entity156 , which does not exist and got the name of princess @entity56 ’s sister wrong			2
the woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to @entity79 police station in north @entity162 , but said officers ‘ laughed in my face ’			1
victims : @entity79 osteopath @entity166 , left , referred clients to @entity8 in the belief she could help			1
opera singer @entity169 handed over £ 256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in @entity173 this left her so angry she forced her way into @entity149 ’s home with the help of mr @entity166 , who was paying the rent on that property , and three others			2
inside they found the voodoo treasure trove – which also included drawings of an ‘ evil eye ’ , burned photos and a brand new barrister ’s wig			0
@entity149 would give her ' customers ' detailed instructions about how the money was to be paid - always in cash and in a brown envelope			1
part of her system was to demand a full - length photograph from each victim			1
one victim - who was told to pay £ 18,000 or her partner would die - said : ' i was absolutely terrified			1
i was living in fear and doing what i was told			0
' another was 82 - year - old former opera singer @entity203 , who was duped out of more than £ 350,000 by @entity149 between 1998 and 2010			2
another still was the mother of a ten - year - old boy with @entity207 who was conned out of £ 42,000 when @entity149 claimed she could cure his behavioural problems			1
the widow , whom the judge described as a ' delightful lady ' , handed over the money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to ' save ' her ill sister			1
voodoo dolls : @entity8 's con was exposed when mr @entity166 and property manager @entity219 grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at @entity221 in @entity79 , north @entity162 pet : mr @entity166 had been visiting one flat to feed @entity8 's pet monkey , @entity225 , but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed			1
the money was later adopted by the tv comic @entity90 ' i ’m relieved that she wo n’t be doing it to anybody else , ' @entity231 said today			2
' i feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort to that , especially as she was a friend of mine			2
i feel terribly let down that she could behave like that			2
' she relieved me of a lot of money but i ’m still here			0
i was gullible , i suppose , but my sister was very ill at the time			1
' other victims included retired solicitor @entity243 , who paid £ 7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia , and former photographer @entity245 , who handed @entity246 thousands to improve the health of his mother who was having heart surgery			0
a couple , who can not be named , gave tens of thousands to the fraudster after she claimed she could help with their child ’s disability and behavioural problems			0
another victim , @entity256 , handed over around £ 160,000 to ' protect ' him from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin			0
gear : piles of rubbish filled the flats and stacks of carrier bags from designer stores littered the rooms her barrister , @entity267 , told the court @entity149 ’s elderly mother had been unwell for a considerable time and she visits her every day			0
but the judge told her : ' i find no mitigating factors in your case at all			0
' detective constables @entity277 and @entity278 said : ' we are very pleased with the sentence			0
it reflects the serious nature of her actions and the fact that she has shown no remorse			0
' we are relieved that her evil schemes have been stopped as we consider @entity149 as dangerous as a violent offender			1
' she is a nasty , cruel person who targeted vulnerable people , preying on them when they were desperate for support and guidance			1
in the end , her greed and arrogance was her downfall			0
' we want to thank the victims for showing great courage in standing up to her and giving their evidence			0

@entity8 , 59 , from @entity162 , conned life savings from 11 people
she said money was a ' sacrifice ' that would be hung from a magic tree
she ' helped ' one woman conceive - then forced her to have an abortion
police : ' she is as dangerous as violent offender *...* a nasty and cruel person '
victim : ' i was gullible , but my sister was ill at the time . i feel let down '
