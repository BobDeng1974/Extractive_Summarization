a woman has spoken of her regrets about going under the knife after a @entity4 surgeon botched her facelift and left her with her ears sewn awkwardly to the side of her face			1
@entity9 , 56 , from @entity10 , had hoped the operation would deal with her jowls and says she was looking ' worn out ' ahead of the procedure			1
but the ' horrendous ' scars produced by the bungling surgeon have left her bereft of confidence and feeling worse than ever before			0
plastic surgeon consultant @entity35 commented : ' her scars are really very poor			0
they 're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes			2
' @entity9 's problems began when she noticed she was looking more tired than usual and set about finding a cosmetic solution			2
in the @entity43 , the average facelift costs Â£ 7,900 , so @entity9 was thrilled when she found a @entity4 surgeon offering cut - price operations that cost a fraction of the @entity43 equivalent			1
having already had successful cosmetic procedures in the past , among them breast implants and a tummy tuck , she says she felt positive about the prospect of facelift			0
her husband agreed at the time , hoping it might ' freshen her up ' , but says , with hindsight , that ' it was one of the worst ideas i 've ever had in my life			0
' expert opinion : ' her scars are really very poor , ' admits plastic surgeon consultant @entity35 , who set out to correct the damage by re-doing her facelift			2
' they 're stretched and they are dragging down her earlobes ' mr @entity35 ( left ) recommends another full face and neck lift to correct the damage , but warns @entity9 ( right ) she could be risking nerve damage and further scarring an excited @entity9 then travelled to @entity4 for the procedure , where such ' bargains ' are common , checked into an @entity75 clinic and went under the knife			1
initially thrilled with her ' fresh , plumped - out skin ' , doubts began to set in during the healing process			0
expecting a dramatic change , the healed facelift , says @entity9 , ' had n't done anything ' - except , much to her horror , leave her with earlobes that had been ' sewn ' to the sides of her face			1
according to mr @entity35 , this was due to the surgeon stitching up @entity9 's face in the wrong position , resulting in bad scarring that should have been concealed behind her ears , not around them still , @entity9 is determined to go ahead , and after a gruelling session on the operating table at the hands of mr @entity35 ( pictured ) , she comes out smiling ' we 've lifted her neck , we 've pulled up her face , and got rid of all those scars , ' mr @entity35 states			1

@entity9 , who had been left miserable by her experience , says the new face lift has restored her confidence and left her happier			1
' finally i am happy , ' she says			0
' my scars have drastically reduced and now i can stop worrying about going out , or about people looking at me from the side			0

' my scars have drastically reduced and now i can stop worrying about going out , or about people looking at me from the side '			0
