@entity0 in @entity1 is famous for @entity2 , also known as the @entity3 , but another airborne animal is nowhere near as popular			1
grasshoppers in ' plague proportions ' have destroyed hectacres of land in @entity0 in recent days after a severe drought there			1
‘ you walk out on your garden and they just swarm up from the lawn ’ one local told @entity15			1
they are finally moving on but they have laid eggs and left devastation behind			0
the locusts have destroyed any greenery they can find , chewing up the leaves and lawns , and stripping trees bare			2
' it 's at plague proportions here , ' another local said			2
although some insects thrive in moist conditions , heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers			1
they are the most most common insects that cause problems during periods of heat and drought			1
the @entity46 told @entity47 it has been monitoring the situation , but there was no plague			0
all that 's left on the tree is the fruits as the grasshoppers ate all the foliage ‘ what we have got is some areas where there is a localised , high - density infestation , ' spokesman @entity56 said			1
‘ but the extent of the infestation certainly does not qualify the current population levels to plague proportions			2
‘ we have been watching that population very closely , obviously			0
we have our own field staff based at @entity0 and they are very aware of what is in that area			1
' @entity70 and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers even if the grasshoppers are about to move on they still have left a calling card that could prove disastrous in the future			1
‘ what we will see now is that those adults that are still in condition to do so will lay some eggs , " he said			0
‘ we would expect that within the next two to four weeks we would start to see the third generation of nymphs coming out of the ground			2
‘ that generation and the extent and the density of that generation will determine what if any control is implemented			0
' another worry are @entity94 looking for food with groups of 25 - 30 coming in groups in and around the town			0
until the grasshopper infestation it was the @entity3 that @entity0 was famous for after one of the founding centres for @entity2 , the @entity103 domestic and international airline			2
one of the airline 's original hangars remains in use at the @entity107 and is listed on the @entity108			0
the town is now the home of the @entity111			0
groups of kangeroos have been seen in and around the town searching for food			0

hectacres of land in the town of @entity0 have been destroyed
‘ you walk out on your garden and they just swarm up , ’ one local said
weeks of severe drought in the region has already made life *difficult*
