by @entity0 published : 23:58 est , 1 january 2014 updated : 00:57 est , 2 january 2014 a woman mauled by a bear in central @entity4 earlier this month has spoken out publicly about the attack for the first time , telling state wildlife officials she thought she might die			1
' that bear was trying to kill me , it just kept coming , ' said @entity10 , who suffered injuries to her face and head during the december 2 incident in her secluded neighborhood in @entity16			2
@entity10 , 54 , has declined media requests for interviews after surviving what officials have described as the worst reported bear attack on a human in @entity4 history			1
' that bear was trying to kill me ' : @entity10 ( right ) was the victim of the worst bear attack in @entity4 history last month and is now speaking out about the horrific mauling in the report released on tuesday by the @entity27 , @entity10 told investigators she said she had just stepped out of her house for an evening stroll with her two dogs when a black bear charged at her from bushes nearby			2
the ' snarling and growling ' beast stopped short of her location but ' continued to lunge forward and then back away over and over , ' the report said			0
as @entity10 backed away , hoping to retreat to her home , the bear circled her and cut off her escape route and knocked her to the ground , the report added			0
she got up but the bear pushed her down again , it added			0
@entity10 said she fought back with her fists as the bear started biting her in the face and shaking her , trying to hit it and gouge the animal 's eyes out			1
but she sustained multiple injuries before managing to get up and rush to a neighbor 's house for help			0
' deep , ragged lacerations ' : black bears like this one have become increasingly common in @entity4			1
however , attacks -- especially those like @entity10 's , which left her badly injured -- are extremely rare ( file photo ) the extent of @entity10 's injuries was unclear , since she declined to be photographed or release any records kept by her medical providers , according to the @entity27			1
a commission investigator who saw @entity10 , before and after surgery , said he observed ' deep , ragged lacerations on the face and head that appeared consistent with wounds inflicted by an animal 's teeth			1
' the commission 's report said investigators had concluded that @entity10 did nothing intentional to provoke the adult female bear that lunged at her			2
the animal , which was captured and later identified through dna tests as the attacker , may be a ' highly protective ' mother who saw @entity10 as a threat to her three cubs			2
dangerous : experts believe the bear was protecting its cubs when it attacked @entity10 , who was out walking her dogs ( file photo ) @entity88 , a wildlife commission spokeswoman , said the bear that mauled @entity10 was being held in a non-public area of @entity90 in @entity91 with two of her cubs			1
' in the springtime the plan is the two cubs will be released and she will be held in captivity for the rest of her life , ' @entity94 said			0

' this is the worst reported attack on a person in the state 's history , ' @entity94 said .			0

@entity10 , 54 , endured ' deep , ragged lacerations on the face and head that appeared consistent with wounds inflicted by an animal 's teeth '
the @entity127 , @entity4 woman did nothing to provoke the bear , which experts believe was *defending* its cubs
@entity10 's area of @entity4 has a high incidence of bear - human *encounters* but attacks are extremely rare
