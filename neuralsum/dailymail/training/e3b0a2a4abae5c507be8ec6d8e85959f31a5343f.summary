by @entity0 a personal trainer to the stars says you do n't need to match the salaries of celebrities in order to emulate their athletic physiques			0
instead , @entity9 - whose clients include singers @entity11 and @entity13 and @entity15 star @entity14 - said all you need to stay in shape is some basic equipment like dumbbells ... and his new book			1
and if you ca n't afford the dumbbells he recommends working with what you have instead , whether that 's a water bottle , brief case or handbag			2
solutions for all : @entity9 says anyone can get fit without expensive equipment - even a water bottle could be used as a weight			1
the svelte @entity11 , right , is one of his celebrity clients @entity30 based @entity9 , 39 , has written ' the @entity31 ' , published by @entity32 next week , in which he reveals the fitness secrets he shares with the stars			1
he explained to @entity35 that it 's not about spending money but changing lifestyle habits and getting active - no matter where you are			2
as such , his workouts can be done at home , in the local park or even at work or while on holiday			0
he said : ' working with people in the entertainment and business worlds , i have had to find fitness solutions for them that are creative and spontaneous , for example at the recording studio , on set or in hotel rooms on the road			0
the book is a natural progression of this type of work			2
' the park is your oyster : a local bench can be used for step ups , or you can do the moves on your stairs at home no dumbbells ? use your bag to tone up your arms by weightlifting without going to the gym no need for fancy equipment : @entity9 demonstrates to a client how a tree can be used for pull ups he added : ' i hope that it breaks down some of the barriers to fitness and demonstrates just how easy it can be to enjoy fitness and have fun			1
it 's aimed at anyone who wants to become more active , particularly those who are time pressured and who do n't always have fancy equipment close by			0
' @entity9 has devised a number of routines aimed at raising the heart rate and strength and conditioning			1
moves include lunges , squats and press ups and high intensity interval work			0
while this type of workout is nothing new , @entity9 said it is often overlooked as people look for complicated challenges over simplicity - when the latter can provide just as good , or better , results			1
mobile workouts : @entity9 said the aim of the book is to help people keep fit wherever they are he said : ' most experts try to make fitness sound complicated , i wanted to create something that was so simple that it would be usable			1
i 've always felt that simplicity is an art form , fitness unplugged if you like			0
' as a result , @entity9 is all for using what you have around you to help you achieve your fitness goals , rather than splashing out on expensive gym membership and equipment			1
for example , if you ca n't afford to buy dumbbells or an @entity132 bar , he suggests lifting a heavy bag or brief case instead or do pull ups using a tree branch			1
your local park bench is a useful tool for step ups and press ups while the stairs at home can also be used to keep fit			1
he said : ' everyone is an individual			0
i want people to work as hard as they can safely , while having fun			0
i want them to create habits that encourage consistency - this is where so many people fall short in their fitness routines , you have to be in it for life			0
' this is why @entity9 says it 's important for people to find out which location works for them			1
for some of his celebrity clients , like blogger @entity164 , this means exercising in his hotel room when travelling for work			0
@entity164 said : ' despite my poor diet while i was in town and drinking like a @entity30 , i still managed to lose weight and improve my fitness during my recent trip			0
and i have @entity9 to thank for that			1
' busy @entity30 mayor @entity174 is another of @entity9 's clients and he advised him to do daily stretches and moves that were possible to do in his office incorporating his furniture like his desk and chair			1
even though @entity9 owns a fitness studio of his own , club 51 , in @entity30 , he believes exercising in a non-gym environment is the future			2
he said : ' gyms need to spend more time working on behavioral change and helping people plan lifestyle fitness solutions , they are too easily led down the fad route and often do n't offer value , this is why the budget gyms are booming			0
' thanks to advances in wearable technology and remote - based coaching , people can now get levels of support and help that the traditional gym will be unable to match			0
' along with the exercise routines , @entity9 explains how to get your mind in gear for a long - ­ term commitment to fitness			2
he also shares motivational tips , fat ‐ burning advice and nutritional information			0
the @entity211 by @entity9 is published by @entity212 on 8th may , paperback £ 12.99			2

@entity9 has worked with @entity11 , @entity13 and @entity14
devised exercises they could do anywhere
