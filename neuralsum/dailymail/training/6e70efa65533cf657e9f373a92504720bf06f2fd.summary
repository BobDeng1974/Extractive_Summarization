by @entity0 published : 16:48 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 01:20 est , 15 may 2012 @entity2 passengers caught entering @entity3 with cannabis in their luggage are being let off with just a ‘ slap on the wrist ’			1
customs staff were found to have handed out nothing more than a warning to passengers arriving at @entity3 ’s second biggest airport			1
@entity14 officials insist that anyone caught with the illegal class b drug in their luggage should be arrested on the spot			1
they can face a jail term of up to 14 years			2
but inspectors found that at @entity21 , where small amounts of cannabis were discovered , passengers were not even detained by officials			1
no punishment : critics fear @entity3 is now an ' open door ' for drug smugglers instead they were given an oral warning , had the drug confiscated and then were allowed to continue their journey			1
the revelations have prompted fears that cannabis laws are being widely ignored across @entity3 ’s airports , leading to a virtual ‘ open door ’ situation for drug smugglers who know they have every chance of escaping any punishment even if caught			1
details of the practice at @entity21 emerged in a report by the chief inspector of the @entity44 , @entity45			2
airport records for april and may 2011 showed that a total of four passengers were found with small quantities of cannabis after luggage searches at @entity52			1
four passengers caught smuggling cannabis were let off with a slap on the wrist in april and may 2011 under the rules , they should have been arrested and their case passed to an investigation team			1
but instead , inspectors said , all four ‘ were allowed to proceed with a warning ’			1
inspectors are allowed to let low - level drugs offenders pay a fine known as a compound settlement , but this must be done with the approval of a senior officer			2
in none of the four cases was the passenger even given a financial penalty			2
the passengers ’ personal details were recorded on an internal @entity44 computer system , but were not passed to the police or placed on the @entity76			1
in effect , they have nothing against their name unless they commit the same crime again			2
one former customs officer said : ‘ the police are now giving out warnings for bringing in cannabis ... it would not surprise me in the least if this was more widespread			2
’ last night @entity89 , of campaign group @entity90 , said : ‘ this is ridiculous			0
it sends the message , “ bring your cannabis here to @entity3 and if we catch you it does n’t matter ”			1
‘ this is simply an extension of the police ’s lax attitude on the streets towards cannabis into the airport			0
they do not consider it a crime and they are happy to turn a blind eye			0
‘ those who are caught should be dealt with properly and arrested			1
‘ if the authorities did prosecute a few it would send a message that we take cannabis seriously , which we obviously do not at the moment			0
’ @entity111 , assistant chief inspector of the @entity44 , said that what the inspectors found was ‘ worrying ’ and officials were acting outside the law			0
‘ clearly we were concerned with what we found , ’ he said			0
‘ they should comply with the rules that are set out and they did not			0
' under the @entity123 the maximum penalty for bringing a class b drug such as cannabis into @entity3 is 14 years in jail and an unlimited fine			1
but in practice , penalties for cannabis possession on @entity3 ’s streets have been steadily eroded in recent years			1
the drug was downgraded to @entity131 by the then @entity132 , @entity134 ’s @entity133 , in 2004			2
decriminalised : cannabis was downgraded to @entity131 by the then @entity132 , @entity134 's @entity133 , in 2004 since then , users have no longer faced automatic arrest			0
instead , police give a formal warning for cannabis possession on the street			2
even after it was restored to @entity131 in 2008 police were allowed to give out cannabis warnings , which were handed to nearly 19,000 offenders in 2010 and do not go on offenders ’ formal record			0
experts warned that ignoring penalties would encourage more people to bring in drugs			0
criminologist dr @entity151 , director of the @entity153 think tank , said : ‘ if you allow it to be known that the law is not enforced , people will break it more frequently			0
‘ @entity159 will spread that you can get cannabis in at @entity21 and more people will try to bring it in			0
’ the report said staff had been moved away from @entity166 checks to staff immigration controls			0
@entity168 , deputy general secretary of the @entity169 , said : ‘ i ca n’t say i ’m surprised			0
like everything , the customs side of the operation is limited and there ’s a lot of pressure to put people on to immigration checks			0
‘ given the pressure on staff i can understand if the view was to confiscate the drugs and let the individual go			0
’ a @entity184 spokesman said : ‘ our message is clear : importing cannabis is illegal and our officers will seize it and other illegal drugs if smugglers try to bring it into the @entity3			1
‘ in recent weeks we have seized 100 kilos [ 220lb ] of cannabis alone , and we are continuing to tackle the drug trade and prosecute smugglers			1

passengers caught with small amount of drug are escaping with a warning
critics fear smugglers will flock to @entity3 , without fear of prosecution
