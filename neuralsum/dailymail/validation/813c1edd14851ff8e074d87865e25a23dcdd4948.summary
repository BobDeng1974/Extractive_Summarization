police say there is little that can be done against a man who made a @entity4 salute while urinating on a memorial in a former concentration camp			1
photos of @entity8 , 24 , urinating next to the @entity9 at the @entity11 concentration , were handed to @entity13 police by a disgusted former friend			1
but the force investigated have admitted it may be difficult to take legal action against @entity17 , as promoting @entity4 ideology is not illegal in the @entity13 like it is in neighbouring @entity19 or @entity20			1
disgusting : @entity8 was said to be drunk when he was photographed urinating on a memorial in a concentration camp in the @entity13			1
he has since denied being a nazi to @entity13 media the pictures were taken when @entity8 was visiting the former camp , situated in the north of the @entity13 close to the @entity19 border with @entity29 , 25			1
@entity29 said he decided to hand the evidence over to the police after he was appalled by his former friend 's action , who was allegedly drunk at the time			2
' i knew that he had some questionable ideas but when he started urinating alongside star @entity38 and then stood on the wall making a @entity4 salute i just felt it was going too far , as i handed the photos in to the police ' , he said			1
' i have n't had anything to do with him since but i reckon he should be punished for what he was up to			0
' @entity13 media has reported that @entity17 has a @entity4 tattoo on his arm with the words ' arbeit macht frel ' - meaning ' work makes you free ' , the same chilling saying that was put above the entrance to @entity54 and other concentration camps			1

the pair were visiting the @entity69 monument in the north of the @entity13 , the site where thousands of people died at the hands of @entity74 offices after speaking with the media by telephone , @entity8 added that he is not a @entity77 and said his tattoo had been removed since the pictures were taken			2
thousands of people died at the hands of the @entity74 officers and from malnutrition while being held at the @entity11 concentration camp , which was open between november 1941 and may 1945			2

more than 150,000 people , including tens of thousands of children , were held in the camp for either months or years before being sent to their deaths at @entity94 and @entity54			0
