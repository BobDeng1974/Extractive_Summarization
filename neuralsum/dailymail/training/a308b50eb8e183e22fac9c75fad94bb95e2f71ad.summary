@entity0 announced himself to @entity2 football by scoring during @entity4 's 4 - 0 win against @entity5			1
but who is the 20 - year - old @entity8 midfielder ? @entity10 's resident @entity8 expert @entity9 takes a look			1
who is @entity4 ’s latest start turn ? @entity0 is n't 21 until next march and already he 's a @entity14 scorer			2
born in @entity15 , he was missed by the biggest local club ’s scouts but @entity4 brought him to the capital			0
how long has @entity19 had his eye on him ? @entity0 scored for @entity4 during their 4 - 0 win against @entity5 in the @entity14 the 20 - year - old is congratulated by his @entity24 team - mates at the @entity25 on tuesday night when he was a @entity26 player last season @entity0 was already getting games for the b - team in @entity8 ’s second division			1
last summer he was taken on the pre-season tour , largely because @entity4 bulked the squad out with youth - teamers because only 10 senior players were back from @entity35 duty			0
but he impressed enough in training @entity36 to debut against @entity37 in @entity38			0
this season he has been a regular for the b - team but has already played 90 minutes in the @entity40 for the first time			0
what ’s his profile ? he has been likened to @entity44 and can certainly offer plenty going forward as five goals for the b - team show			1
he can play as a no 10 or in @entity4 ’s 4 - 3 - 3 either side of the central midfielder			2
he played to the left of @entity51 in @entity4 ’s second - leg 5 - 0 cup win over @entity53 last week			0
@entity0 has been likened to one of @entity4 's other attacking midfielders , @entity44 manager @entity19 has been keeping a careful eye on the midfielder in recent months so there will be no stopping him now ? a @entity14 goal does n’t always make for a @entity4 career			1
@entity61 scored in the competition while coming up from the youth team but had to leave the club to make a career for himself			2
but @entity19 is a big fan of @entity0 and for as long as the @entity66 is at the @entity25 he will have a chance			1
with @entity68 and @entity69 currently out injured he is closer to the first team than ever			0
he will play out the rest of the season in the b - team if @entity4 sign @entity74 in january , but he is expected to tour with the first team against next summer .			0
