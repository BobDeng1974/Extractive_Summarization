by @entity0 published : 19:33 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 19:33 est , 16 june 2013 doomed and saved : an ash tree infected by dieback which may now be a sight soon forgotten scientists have made a breakthrough in the battle against the disease that is ravaging @entity9 ’s ash population			1
they have unravelled the genetic code of a tree that is resistant to ash dieback			1
the information could be used to breed ashes that are impervious to the killer fungus – and , in time , repopulate @entity9 ’s forests and woodlands			0
the scientists behind the breakthrough describe it as ‘ giving nature a helping hand ’			2
however , it may not be a help in protecting the @entity9 ’s existing ash population , which is being killed off by the rapid spread of the disease			1
@entity28 , which ravaged other @entity30 countries before entering the @entity9 , kills 90 per cent of the trees it affects			0
it has spread to 500 sites since first spotted here little more than a year ago experts fear it could become the new @entity37 elm disease , causing widespread destruction of one of @entity9 ’s best - loved trees			0
the country ’s 80million ash trees support wildlife as well as the £ 10billion timber industry and take up about a third of @entity47 woodland			1
researchers at the @entity49 and the @entity50 , both in @entity52 , have decoded the dna of a @entity55 ash tree that was found to be able to withstand the fungus			1
known as @entity58 , it remained healthy , while other trees around it withered and died			0
scientists around the world are being encouraged to analyse the data , which could be used to seek out ashes in @entity9 that have a similar genetic profile			2
other options include crossing @entity67 with native ashes – or breeding with other trees known to be immune to ash dieback – to create a stock of super-resistant saplings			2
saviour : scientists have identified the genetic code of tree resistant to ash dieback , which kills 90 per cent of the trees it infects it will take ten to 20 years to breed saplings suitable for restocking the countryside			1
professor @entity83 , of the @entity50 , said : ‘ we ’re trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of trees to do the appropriate crosses			0
‘ it would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and breeding is going to take a long time			0
’ while fungicides might help in some cases , the probability is that @entity9 will lose most of its ash trees , he said .			0

scientists have identified the genetic code of tree resistant to dieback
@entity107 may help save the @entity47 ash tree population
