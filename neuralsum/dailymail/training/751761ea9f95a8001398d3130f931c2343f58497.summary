legal channels : a district court judge is going to mediate a hearing between @entity15 's family and her doctors after a continued battle over whether or not her life support can be turned off @entity35 in @entity1 , @entity36 , claims the damage is so severe that the child is effectively dead and they want to turn off a respirator keeping her heart pumping			1
but the family are adamant she can recover and want her moved to a different medical facility where she can receive long term care			2
the war of words , which has divided public opinion , has become so heated that each side is accusing each other of lying and using the tragedy to further their own ends			2
now they have been dragged into @entity52 for a ' mandatory settlement conference ' to try to hammer out their differences			0
the meeting at 11am will bring to a head three weeks of legal wrangling encompassing three courts and two injunctions – the last of which will run out on tuesday			0
grief : @entity63 and @entity64 react as they speak to the @entity66 outside of @entity35 in @entity1 on january 1 , 2014 @entity15 ’s family , citing religious beliefs and the hope that she will pull through , want to continue life support indefinitely			1

the @entity111 has been working with @entity15 's relatives to get her moved to a care facility			1

@entity97 's parents set up the foundation in 2001 to fight for @entity124 's case and now the organisation is devoted to helping families of incapacitated patients facing a loss of life support			1
@entity15 's mother @entity64 , believes her daughter can recover and is fighting plans to turn off her ventilator			1

' she was very scared			0
she knew something was wrong			0
to see your daughter like that is just heartbreaking			0
' but i still have hope			0
in fact i have more than hope			0
i am positive my daughter is going to wake up			0

' they do n’t even refer to her by name			0
they refer to her as the deceased , or the body , or the dead and my daughter is not dead			2
' they are awful , they have no compassion			0
' backing : @entity97 was at the center of a right - to - life debate that captivated the @entity213 for several years in the late 90s and early 2000s , and a foundation set up in her name is supporting @entity15 's family mrs @entity64 , who has three other children , said all she wanted to do was get her daughter away from the hospital to a place that cared for her			1
' the doctors here pretty much want my daughter gone ' , she said			0
' i want the same thing but i want her out of here alive , they want her out of here dead			2
