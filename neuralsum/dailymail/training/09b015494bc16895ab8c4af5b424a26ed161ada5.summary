in the end , @entity0 remembered their duty to play like champions			1
two goals conjured from the dying embers of a testing match restored their confidence and increased their optimism that their title can be retained			0
the @entity10 may not be won at this autumnal stage of the season , but a defeat would have proved crushingly expensive			1
as it turned out , the fans were singing , blue flags were waving and the table was looking a happier place			0
the goals came from the kind of players who were acquired — at enormous expense — with precisely these occasions in mind			0
@entity26 , after emerging slowly into the match , remained icily cool amid the uproar as he simply passed his chance into the net			1
and @entity30 , totally unruffled by his earlier misses , did what he does supremely well — surging on to the chance , controlling the ball at pace and tearing off a scoring drive			1
at such moments , their talents seem to have been purchased all too cheaply			0
in truth , @entity0 were not entirely convincing			1
there was an incoherence about their approach play , their finishing lacked its usual authority and while they were rarely put under genuinely testing pressure , their defence allowed the kind of space which better teams than @entity53 might have exploited			1
but they retained a conviction that everything would work out , that this story would have a happy ending			0
@entity30 celebrates finally finding a way beyond @entity53 goalkeeper @entity61 @entity0 captain @entity62 ( left ) walks back to his post after celebrating @entity26 's opening goal @entity0 manager @entity65 and assistant @entity66 look on during their match at @entity69 @entity69 is the kind of place where prospective champions must come to state their case			1
they have to look impressive , at ease with their talents , perhaps the touch of an intimidating swagger			0
@entity0 understood the demands ; meeting them was proving a problem			1
they offered energy to spare , commitment to burn , but little of that crisp , incisive passing which distinguishes their better days			0
as ever , the major players were as good as their reputations			0
@entity62 was massively influential in central defence , perceiving problems seconds before anybody had even suspected them and dealing with them with his customary authority			1
@entity95 ghosted through the game with intelligent awareness ; controlling the tempo of the effort , subtly investigating defensive lapses			1
and at the point of the attack , @entity30 simply oozed menace and intent , reminding us why he is possibly the finest striker in all @entity106			1
but given such resources , @entity0 were making hard work of their task			1
at times in the first half , they looked not so much a good team as an extremely expensive one			0
@entity0 's toure is tackled by @entity53 's @entity114 on saturday evening @entity0 defender @entity115 struck the post with an early shot at @entity69 despite early frustration , @entity0 proved their title credentials with a win at @entity69 and the home side , in truth , had been no more than awkward			1
a combination of finance and circumstance has made @entity53 one of those clubs who seem to know their place			2
and that place is not to be found alongside the likes of @entity0			2
they work with energy , they toil unsparingly to put their plans into action , yet they remain a team who seem grateful for small mercies			0
and yet , there is a genuine spirit about their game , and they revealed it within moments of the second half			0
first , they allowed @entity30 the kind of chance which the finest striker in all @entity106 usually buries			2
this time , @entity30 thumped it wastefully against a post			2
at which relief , @entity53 scampered purposefully into @entity0 ’s defensive quarters and @entity157 was frustrated only in the final step of an enterprising attack			1
a @entity53 goal at that stage would have provoked a real examination of @entity0 ’s credentials			1
as the match entered its final third , as the game became stretched and as @entity53 legs began to betray the strain of endless chasing , we waited for the major players to strike the telling blows			2
but as minutes ticked past , so the nerves grew taut			0
@entity30 struck a fine blow , well parried by @entity61			2
@entity95 ’s finish met a similar fate , while the sweeper @entity177 was allowed the finest chance of all , but fluffed his header			2
suddenly emboldened , the @entity53 fans started to mock their aristocratic visitors			2
they even began to believe that their own folk hero , the substitute @entity182 , might upset form and overwhelming fancy			0
and then , with eight minutes remaining , @entity26 scored the goal which shattered their illusions			0
it was a touch of glittering class			0
when @entity30 made his contribution , the argument was over			0
they may have cause to remember those moments when the points are counted in may			0
@entity65 brought @entity196 on with the scores at 0 - 0 as @entity0 attempted to go ahead @entity26 's teammates joins him in celebrating the opening goal against a resilient @entity53 side @entity30 strokes the ball beyond @entity53 goalkeeper @entity61 early in the second half , but it hits the post			1
