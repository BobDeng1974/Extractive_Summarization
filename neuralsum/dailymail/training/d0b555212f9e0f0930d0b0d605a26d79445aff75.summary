reverend @entity1 used his internet accounts to spread ideas which were ' clearly anti-semitic ' , the @entity0 said a vicar who suggested @entity5 was responsible for the 9/11 attack on the twin towers has been banned from @entity8 and other social media for six months , the @entity0 said yesterday			1
the reverend @entity1 used his internet accounts to spread ideas which were ‘ clearly anti-semitic ’ , it said			1
but despite his ‘ indefensible ’ actions the cleric will be allowed to remain a priest and to keep his job as vicar of the wealthy parish of @entity16 in @entity17 in @entity18			1
the @entity0 ’s verdict on mr @entity1 follows a series of clashes between the vicar and @entity25 leaders over his vehement campaigning against @entity5 , during which he attended a conference in @entity28 during which @entity5 was accused of plotting the 9/11 attack			1
the controversy over the vicar came to a crisis last month when he posted an article on his @entity35 page which attempted to connect wealthy @entity25 to the attacks			1
‘ is this antisemitic ? ’ mr @entity1 commented under the link , adding ‘ it raises so many questions			2
’ yesterday @entity40 the right reverend @entity41 said that the vicar ’s campaigning on the @entity44 was ‘ no longer compatible with his ministry as a parish priest			2
’ the bishop declared : ‘ i do not believe that his motives are anti-semitic ; but i have concluded that , at the very least , he has demonstrated appallingly poor judgment in the material he has chosen to disseminate , particularly via social media , some of which is clearly anti-semitic			1
‘ by associating with or promoting subject matter , which is either ambiguous in its motivation , or , worse still , openly racist , he has crossed a serious line			0
i regard these actions as indefensible			0
’ bishop @entity41 said he welcomed the fact that mr @entity1 apologised amid the controversy that followed his latest @entity35 intervention in the debate over terrorism together with ‘ his recognition of the deep hurt caused by his actions , his acknowledgement of the gross insensitivity of their timing just prior to @entity72 , and his retraction of the ridiculous suggestion that @entity5 may have been complicit in the events of 9/11			1
’ the bishop set a series of conditions for mr @entity1 keeping his job			0
they include a promise from the vicar to stop using social media entirely for six months , to stop writing and speaking about the @entity44 and its history , and to stay away from conferences that promote an anti-zionist agenda			1
he has also undertaken to stop writing or preaching anything on the subject , to avoid posting links to articles on the subject , and to prevent anyone else from speaking on his behalf on the matter			0
@entity94 terrorists crashed two hijacked planes into the @entity96 , killing thousands mr @entity1 will resign from his job at @entity16 immediately if he breaks his pledges ‘ in letter or in spirit ’ , the bishop added			2
bishop @entity41 said that mr @entity1 will ‘ redirect his energies into his work as a parish priest			2
’ the bishop added : ‘ i am hugely sorry for the hurt which has been caused to members of the @entity108 , and i hope and pray that the storms of the past two weeks will ultimately serve to deepen and strengthen our relationship , one with another			0
this is a time when i would urge all @entity114 people to stand shoulder to shoulder with our @entity25 brothers and sisters in countering the alarming rise of anti-semitic incidents being reported			0
’ the @entity120 , the representative body for @entity123 jews , said : ‘ we are grateful that the @entity0 shared our deep concern that mr @entity1 had indeed crossed a line in the offensive materials he was posting and linking to online			2
‘ we hope that mr @entity1 ’s unbecoming and inappropriate conduct has now been brought to a close			0
’ yesterday ’s pledges were not the first time the vicar has undertaken to moderate the views he promotes on the internet			0
following complaints by the @entity120 in 2013 , he promised that in future three people would read his website and blog in order to check the content and monitor links to websites .			0
