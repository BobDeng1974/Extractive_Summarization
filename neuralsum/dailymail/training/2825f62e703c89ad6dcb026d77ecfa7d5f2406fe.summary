@entity0 will be hauled over the coals by @entity2 after he ridiculously swapped shirts with @entity5 defender @entity4 at half - time			1
on a night when @entity9 's @entity8 ambitions were left hanging by a thread after a goal from @entity13 and two from @entity15 condemned them to a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity17 , @entity0 came in for huge criticism , especially from the @entity19			1
the local publication insisted that @entity0 must apologise to the club to continue his career with the @entity23			1
the striker was taken off after another ineffectual performance and @entity2 , who described the switch as ' tactical ' , revealed he would be speaking to the @entity27 , as swapping shirts early is not something of which the manager approves			1
@entity0 swapped shirts with @entity5 defender @entity4 as he wandered down the tunnel at half - time @entity0 endured another torrid night in a @entity9 shirt and was replaced at half - time at @entity17 @entity9 manager @entity2 was not impressed by @entity0 's decision to swap shirts before half - time the @entity19 's back page on thursday last season @entity2 took measures against @entity40 after he traded jerseys with @entity42 during a defeat by @entity44 and @entity0 will be summoned to see @entity2 in his office at @entity9 's @entity47 training ground			1
' i had a similar incident last year and it was dealt with internally , ' said @entity2			2
' it 's exactly the same			0
i heard about it when i came off pitch			0
if you want to do that , it 's something you do at end of the game and something i will deal with			2
' i needed more movement centrally to occupy their centre halves and i felt @entity62 's speed would give us that			0
in the second half you could see every player pressing and working – for us that 's the minimum			0
@entity67 came on and did it very well			0
@entity62 played in position a bit alien to him			0
' others were more damning of @entity0			0
@entity73 's @entity72 said on @entity74 : ' i ca n't change the way i feel about @entity0 and that is nothing to do with what he 's done in a @entity9 shirt			1
it 's what he 's done at @entity83 and @entity84			0
' do i think he 's going to be here long - term ? no , i 'd be surprised to see him here next season if i 'm being honest			2
@entity89 was here a few years , bought @entity90 and sold him in january			0
it might not be that quick but i 'd be surprised if @entity0 is at the club next season			1
' former @entity9 skipper @entity94 added : ' i think it 's disgraceful			2
i think it 's disrespectful to both players			0
if you 're swapping them , what 's the other guy thinking about ? you 're giving away your shirt at half time , what is in his mind ? ' @entity4 places his hand on @entity0 's back as the forward leaves the field not to return for the second half @entity40 ( right ) swapped shirts with @entity44 's @entity42 at @entity112 last december ' he still has a future at @entity9 , ' @entity113 told @entity115			1
' the fans are some of the most patient , but he has to realise he 's playing at @entity9 , not just any other club			2
' he 's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch			0
' the @entity9 fans are very knowledgeable , and you just do n't do that ( swap shirts at half time )			1
' i 'm sure @entity2 will have a word with him behind closed doors			0
' @entity0 's indiscretion , however , should not disguise the fact @entity9 were comfortably beaten by a @entity5 side that moved ominously through the gears , took advantage of some wretched defending and then easily held them at bay in the second period once the game was won			1
@entity2 said : ' we started very well , aggressive in pressing and passing and coped very well			0
then that period after the first goal to half - time – it was a disappointing first goal and the other two were sloppy			1
obviously then 3 - 0 against a team that 's so dangerous is very disappointing			1
' @entity5 are aiming to become the first team in the modern era to retain the @entity8 and @entity13 , who scored the opening goal , said : ' we are thinking step by step and we are going to try to retain it			2
' we know it will be very tough , but we are positive and i think it will be possible if we play like that			0
' @entity13 ( 2nd left ) sent @entity5 on their way with a brilliant effort to open the scoring @entity13 has set his sights on being part of the first team to retain the @entity8 trophy @entity0 looks on despondent as the @entity9 players trudge back to the centre circle following @entity5 's third the @entity27 forward holds his face in his shirt as he wanders away after @entity5 score their third goal @entity169 laments first - half showing			1
