by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 11:01 est , 26 august 2013 experts have found that dramatic surgery carried out on young epilepsy sufferers to remove half of their brain can give children the best chance at living a life free from seizures			1
the rare and dramatic surgery , known as a hemispherectomy , involves surgeons removing , or disconnecting , one half of the brain and a new study has found that the procedure can prevent the seizures			1
scientists reviewed the medical records of patients living with epilepsy and found that after the surgery 56 per cent were left seizure - free			1
medical marvel : experts have found that dramatic surgery , known as a hemispherectomy , can give children the best chance at living a life free from seizures ( picture posed by models ) of the 115 patients involved in the study another 36 per cent still had seizures but around 15 per cent of them saw a reduction in their frequency of more than 90 per cent			1
the study , published in specialist medical journal @entity40 reviewed the records of patients aged two to 28 , most of them children , who had developed epilepsy before the age of three			2
three - quarters of those monitored had daily seizures , while 18 per cent had seizures every week prior to the surgery			2
all of those involved in the study had been treated at the specialist unit of the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			1
head of pediatric epilepsy at the clinic , dr @entity61 , and his colleagues looked at 186 operations performed at the medical centre between 1997 and 2009 , with a particular focus on the 155 patients , as part of the first extensive study to look at the children who have undergone a hemispherectomy			2
the researchers were able to confirm what many doctors had already known , despite the fact that there was little data to support the idea that removing the diseased part of a seizure - prone brain can allow those affected by epilepsy to lead a more normal life			1
' the brain has an amazing capacity to work around the function that it has lost , ' dr @entity61 told @entity88			0
recovery : researchers found that nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance after their operations ( posed by model ) only a small number of people with epilepsy are eligable for a hemispherectomy , which involves surgeons either removing half of the brain entirely , disconnecting the links between the half in which the seizures were originating from the other side			1
dr @entity61 said that doctors at his clinic performed around 15 of the operations every year , and that they were often carried out when anti-seizure medication stops working effectively			0
one of the children featured in the study was three - year - old @entity113 , from @entity114 , @entity57 , who was having more than 12 seizures a day before his operation , after he was diagnosed at just 10 - months - old			1
his father @entity118 said the effects the seizures were having on his little son were such that the child had forgotten his alphabet and how to count			0
when @entity113 turned three his medications stopped working and he started seizing almost constantly , making surgery the only option			0
however , since having the operation to remove almost all of the right side of his brain @entity113 has not had a single seizure , and is a healthy child who loves playing baseball and basketball			2
' i did nâ€™t think the recovery would be anywhere near the point that it is , ' mr @entity113 said			0
the researchers discovered that after their operations , 83 per cent of patients were able to walk without aid , and 70 per cent had satisfactory speaking skills			0
nearly 60 percent of the children were able to attend mainstream schools with assistance , and 42 percent of children older than six had satisfactory reading skills			0
' given that if you had not done the intervention most of these kids would be so severely disabled , the results are actually pretty positive , ' said dr @entity153 , professor of neurosurgery at the @entity155 at the @entity156 , @entity157 .			0
