@entity0 has hit back at criticism levelled at @entity2 , chiefly by @entity3 , and suggested there were ' double standards ' at play in the club versus country row to have engulfed the @entity10 ' season			1
@entity11 ( hamstring ) and @entity13 ( groin ) withdrew from @entity16 's squad for a @entity18 qualifier with @entity19 and a friendly against @entity21			1
it prompted @entity16 defender @entity3 to say he would like players to show the same commitment to the national side as they do their club			2
' @entity3 is a fantastic player but he is not a doctor , ' said @entity0			2
' he is not a doctor and i am the same			0
' my doctor and the @entity44 national team doctor , they had the scans and decided the player was not in a fit condition to play			0
i do n't think @entity3 did a medicine masters in the last couple of years to understand it			2
' @entity51 played for @entity52 , but he did n't play for @entity53 ( against @entity54 ) , ' the @entity50 added			1
okay ? @entity0 drew attention to @entity51 playing for @entity52 after missing @entity53 against @entity54 ' did @entity56 play for @entity57 ? no , he did n't but how many players were injured for the international teams and could recover one week later , doing his work at the club ? lots of them , lots of them			1
' my doctor and the doctor of the @entity44 national team , they had the scans and they decided that the player was not in the condition to play			0
' @entity0 suggested there have been double standards in the reports about @entity13 , again highlighting @entity51 's absence and subsequent return for @entity52 as they beat @entity78			1
' @entity51 did n't play for @entity53 against @entity54 and he played on saturday , ' he said			1
' has he a compromise with his national team ? i think he has			0
he is the captain of @entity53			0
' did he , how do you say , " cheat " by not playing against @entity54 to play today ? i do n't think he did			0
so we all accept that he was injured			0

@entity13 and @entity11 started for @entity2 on saturday
pair were n't fit enough to play for @entity16 during the international *break*
@entity3 questioned the commitment of certain international stars
@entity51 missed @entity53 game but played for @entity52 vs @entity78
