by @entity0 published : 03:25 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 17 june 2013 @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has announced that he will resign amid claims his chief - of - staff and alleged lover recruited government agents to spy on his wife			1
@entity1 , 48 , has been embroiled in a sleaze scandal that has seen seven people , including the current and former heads of the military intelligence agency and three former politicians of his party , charged with bribery or misuse of power			1
but most sensational is the arrest of his closest aide and the head of his office @entity22 who was charged with ordering a military intelligence agency to spy on three people , including @entity1 ’ estranged wife , @entity26			1
@entity1 has insisted that he knew nothing of @entity29 's alleged skullduggery nor did she push him into divorcing his wife			1
affair ? @entity31 ( left ) is alleged to have had an affair with his chief - of - staff @entity22 ( right ) who herself is accused of ordering government agents to spy on @entity1 ' wife @entity22 is also alleged to have bribed three senior mps to step down in return for lucrative jobs in state - run companies			1
she faces five years in jail for abuse of power if convicted			0
she claims she ordered security services out of concern for mrs @entity46 , far from the nefarious motives of which she has been accused			0
her lawyer said : ' this [ surveillance ] was not done for the reason of damaging someone or harming them but rather , due to being cautious , she rached the conclusion that it is necessary to find out some things			0
' the ex wife : @entity1 refused to confirm or deny if ms @entity57 was the reason behind his divorce , finalised last week , to @entity60 ( left ) , the mother of his four children and teenage sweetheart @entity1 said he also will quit on monday as chairman of his conservative @entity65			1
asked directly if ms @entity57 was the reason behind his divorce , finalised last week , to the mother of his four children and teenage sweetheart , @entity1 responded : ' i consider these things to be so bizarre that they do not deserve my comment			1
' the alleged lover : @entity22 is also alleged to have bribed three senior mps to step down in return for lucrative jobs in state - run companies			1
she faces five years in jail for abuse of power if convicted ' i am aware of my political responsibility , ' @entity1 said			1
his decision will end his three - party coalition government , which was created after the 2010 parliamentary election			0
but @entity1 said he hopes it can stay in power until a parliamentary election planned next year			2
this is an optimal solution of the current situation , ' @entity1 said			2
two coalition partners , the conservative top 09 party and the @entity90 , agreed with that plan sunday			0
' we ’re obliged to do all we can for the government to continue , ' said finance minister @entity94 , the deputy head of @entity95			0
that might not happen , however			0
it is up to the president @entity98 to select a new prime minister who would try to form a new government , and it is not immediately clear if he is ready to accept such a solution			0
the current coalition also does n’t have a clear parliamentary majority and governs with the help from independent lawmakers			0
early elections also are not easy to call because it would have to be approved by three - fifths of the 200 lawmakers , and the opposition does not have enough seats to force it			0
the negotiations between the parties are expected to start immediately , and it is not clear how much time they will need to find a solution to the crisis			0
earlier this week , prosecutors said @entity22 was suspected of directing the alleged illegal surveillance without any authorization			2
in their explanation for the sweeping raids at government offices and other locations , they said @entity22 ’s motives were ' purely private			2
' @entity1 announced earlier this week that he and his wife , @entity26 , have filed for divorce			1
newspapers have speculated about an affair between him and @entity22 .			2

@entity1 was under pressure since 7 *colleagues* charged with bribery
chief of staff @entity22 charged with ordering agents to spy on wife
she is also accused of bribing mps to resign in return for state - firm jobs
