by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 13 january 2013 updated : 08:38 est , 14 january 2013 when it was released in 1995 , ‘ @entity3 ’ was revolutionary for being the first feature - length computer animated film			1
nearly two decades later , two amateur film makers have taken it upon themselves to reconstruct the movie in a more traditional medium , making a full - length live action tribute to the @entity10 classic			1
@entity11 , 19 , and @entity12 , 21 , spent the better part of two years meticulously recreating the iconic movie , and recently posted their finished film on @entity17			1
‘ it was just something fun to do , ’ he said , adding that the two worked on the movie in their free time			2
‘ we started by filming on the weekends , all day on saturdays			0
eventually it ended up being , we have to finish because we ’re using this person ’s time or space			0
’ ‘ @entity3 , ’ he added , was his favorite film as a child ( and still is )			2
prior to the project , he had already watched the film ‘ hundreds of times			0
’ the actors , mr @entity11 said , were mostly friends or acquaintances from church			1
‘ @entity34 and @entity61 are brothers to each other , friends of mine from my old church , ’ he said			0
‘ they fit the part closely enough , and they were always anxious to be in one of my films			0
’ the full - length film was shot on a consumer camcorder , using an amalgamation of green screens , stop - motion animation , and good old - fashioned puppetry			1
dynamic duo : @entity11 , left , and @entity12 , right , worked two years on their film incredible journey : after their film 's completion , the @entity81 - based directors traveled to @entity10 's studios outside of @entity85 you 've got a friend in me : @entity26 and @entity30 made the journey too mr @entity11 was usually behind the camera while mr @entity12 operated the puppet ’s strings , though the two would sometimes switch roles			1
filming a live - action ‘ @entity3 ’ proved to be difficult in spots			1
the actors were all young volunteers ( @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and @entity102 ) and some scenes required tricky camerawork and post-production			0
the most difficult scene , mr @entity11 said , was the finale , where some of the toys are chasing their owner @entity34 in the rv			2
he said it was difficult getting the exact shots with actual dogs , and from a moving vehicle			0
after countless hours of shooting and editing , the film was done			0
fearless leader : the aliens responding to @entity30 after he crawled into the ' spacecraft ' at @entity121 the claw : and again in the @entity10 version , @entity30 speaking with the now - iconic green toy aliens mr @entity11 , who is currently studying film at @entity126 , said he and his filming partner had always imagined traveling to the studios outside of @entity85 to celebrate			1
upon their arrival to the @entity132 studios , the young men were allowed to stand out front and hand out dvds of the finished movie			0
‘ a number of ( the @entity10 employees ) were excited to watch it and hear about it , ’ he said			2
the live - action ‘ @entity3 ’ uses the audio from the film , which stars the vocal talents of @entity27 as @entity26 and @entity144 as the unflappable @entity30			1
risky business : mr @entity11 said that the final rescue scene with @entity26 and @entity30 was tricky to film , because it was a moving shot involving real animals and difficult angles reach : the original ' @entity3 ' cost $ 30million to produce and was the first feature - length film to be computer animated while the duo never got explicit permission to be able to use @entity10 ’s material , mr @entity11 said that he and mr @entity12 had tweeted at top - @entity10 executives several times before publishing their work to @entity17 , and had never gotten an explicit ‘ no. ’ ‘ they said just do it , ’ he said			1
‘ if they ’re okay with it , that ’s cool			0
’ mr @entity11 said he loves the end product			2
‘ i ’m glad we did it , ’ but adds that it was a learning experience			0
as of sunday evening , their film has garnered some 253,000 views to very positive acclaim			0
one viewer wrote : ‘ this is so cool on so many levels ! fantastic ! ’ @entity10 ’s ‘ @entity3 ’ had an estimated $ 30million budget , and grossed more than $ 360million worldwide			1
puppet master : @entity12 was usually the one operating the strings of the characters			2

amateur *filmmakers* @entity11 and @entity12 spent two years filming live - action ' @entity3 '
used green screens , stop - motion animation , puppetry , and real - life actors to play out *famous* @entity10 movie
