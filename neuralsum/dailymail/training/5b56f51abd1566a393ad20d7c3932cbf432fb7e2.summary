former vice president @entity0 cautioned on sunday that the next attack on the homeland will be ' far deadlier ' than the last one			1
' we 're in a very dangerous period , ' @entity0 told the @entity7 's @entity6 in a video interview released on sunday			1
' i think it 's more threatening than the period before 9/11			0
' i think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the @entity13 , which , if and when it comes , will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters , ' he continued			1
all the @entity13 had to worry about before 9/11 was @entity32 , he said			2
now the @entity13 faces significant threats from terrorist cells in @entity35 , @entity36 , and all of @entity37 up through the @entity38 to @entity39			2
the former @entity41 administration official acknowledged that ' some of the decisions ' his boss made were controversial and still are now , six years later , the administration 's methods were effective at ' preventing another mass casualty attack on the @entity13 ' ' i do n't think we have any apologies to make , ' @entity0 said			1
' i think in a similar situation today , i would do exactly the same thing , ' he stated			0
sorry i 'm not sorry : @entity0 told @entity7 founder @entity6 he has no regrets about the way he and @entity41 's administration aggressively combated terrorist threats not citing the sitting president , @entity56 , by name , @entity0 suggested that his unwillingness to engage @entity38 countries militarily could prove detrimental to the @entity13 and the international community			1
' for us to look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean , everything 's fine , that 's crazy , ' he said			0
' you got ta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go			0
' we have no choice to be involved in that part of the world , and if we 're not actively involved , some very bad things are gon na happen , ' he added			0
@entity0 also listed a nuclear @entity74 , cuts to the military and @entity77 hackers as worrisome threats to the @entity13 ' i think we 're entering a period of considerable danger with the @entity13 that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be , ' he said			1
' what we need is strong leadership			0
we need a president and a @entity87 who understand the nature of the threat			0
the retired politician expressed hope that the @entity13 ' will rise to the occasion now as we did in the past ' during @entity93 and @entity94 and warned that it 's ' very important that we do so			2
' ' this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels ' or cut defense budget he said , referring to @entity56 's reduction in the military 's size and scope			0
@entity0 did not indicate who he thought would make a good replacement for @entity56 once he leaves office in early 2017 , but he said @entity13 needs ' somebody who will step up and remind the world what the @entity13 is capable of and demonstrate the ability and willingness to do that			1

' i think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the @entity13 , ' @entity0 said
the former vice president credited the increased odds of an attack to ' the dramatic spread of terrorist organizations ' over the last several years
he also defended the @entity41 administration 's aggressive *anti-terrorism* *tactics* : ' i do n't think we have any apologies to make '
