an @entity1 counter-terrorist rescue team is primed and ready to deploy on a mission to fly into @entity3 and rescue @entity6 hostage @entity4 as soon as his location has been pinpointed			1
the team , based a few hours ' away in @entity9 , will be whisked into the war - torn country as soon as @entity6 's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker kidnapped by @entity14 and @entity15 gives the go - ahead for them to go in			1
the director of @entity19 , a @entity6 major general , has already briefed the prime minister on the likely success of a rescue operation and the dangers to troops being inserted into what is arguably the most dangerous country on earth			2
the @entity6 's secret intelligence service @entity44 , @entity46 experts at the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) in @entity48 and the @entity1 are working together in a race against time to establish mr @entity4 's location before the terrorists carry out their threat to execute him - and to reach him before he is moved once again			1
the first priority is to obtain ' proof of life ' , and officials will be working on the assumption that mr @entity4 is still alive because @entity14 has not released a video of his execution			1
but intelligence sources believe that the @entity62 aid worker , who was kidnapped from a refugee camp in @entity64 , northern @entity3 18 months ago , is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another			1
race against time : this video grab shows a masked militant threatening to kill mr @entity4			2
the first priority - before sending in the @entity1 - is to obtain ' proof of life ' , and officials will be working on the assumption that mr @entity4 is still alive because @entity14 has not released a video of his execution ready to go : the team , based a few hours ' away in @entity9 , will be whisked into the war - torn country by @entity79 as soon as @entity6 's intelligence agencies are confident they have located the aid worker ( stock image of @entity83 on a mission in @entity85 in 2002 ) @entity86 : a @entity19 ac - 130 gunship may be used for air support during the mission hard to track : mr @entity4 was abducted in @entity64 , northern @entity3 , but intelligence sources believe the @entity62 aid worker is being moved relatively frequently from one safe house to another so the first stage in any rescue operation is the ' find ' - potentially the most difficult phase - before the hostage 's location is ' fixed '			1
the @entity1 will need to know the exact room of the house in the street of the city , town or village , where he is being held			0
they will need to know how many terrorists are on guard , their weapons and where the closest reinforcements are based			0
with this level of intelligence they can begin to fine tune the plan and start the number crunching process , which will deliver the number of troops and the assets , such as helicopters and combat air support and medical staff , needed to deliver a successful operation			0
one of the greatest intelligence gathering assets at the @entity1 's disposal is the @entity128 @entity127 spy plane , inside which is a bewildering array of gadgetry supposedly capable of ' seeing inside buildings ' and intercepting mobile phone calls			0
but the real hardcore information will come from human sources , disaffected members of @entity14 ready to deal with either @entity44 or the @entity136			0
it is their information , which is likely to pinpoint the ' fix ' - the exact location to within a matter of yards of the hostage 's location once the ' fix ' has been established , the extraction begins			0
hellfire : they will have air support from predator drones armed with hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs , and @entity152 based in @entity9 high tech : one of the greatest intelligence gathering assets at the @entity1 's disposal is the @entity128 @entity127 spy plane , inside which is a bewildering array of gadgetry supposedly capable of ' seeing inside buildings ' and intercepting mobile phone calls last leg : ground crew prepare a @entity128 ( @entity128 ) @entity166 fighter bomber at @entity167 , @entity9 , where @entity4 will likely be taken back to should the mission prove a success a squadron - sized @entity1 force , around 90 to 100 troopers , supported by members of the @entity173 , will insert into the target area and begin the actual rescue			1
they will fly over to @entity3 - or @entity85 if he has been moved across the border - in @entity177 or heavier duty @entity179 helicopters			0
this is the crucial phase and where the element of surprise is vital			0
the operation will be launched at night during the very early hours , before the first muslim prayers of the day			0
they will have air support from predator drones armed with hellfire missiles and 500lb bombs , and @entity191 based in @entity9			2
if @entity37 are assisting the mission there could also be support from @entity37 @entity128 @entity196 gunships , which are equipped with a 30mm cannon , a 40mm @entity199 auto - cannon , missiles and bombs			2
from the moment of ' contact ' with the enemy , the @entity1 may have just minutes to rescue mr @entity4 and other hostages			1
the @entity1 will be equipped with sniper rifles , @entity37 special operations assault rifles , grenade launchers , pistols , stun grenades , silenced weapons , night vision goggles and real - time video satellite - linked to a ground operations room in a safe location - like that used when president @entity216 watched the @entity37 special forces mission to kill @entity218			1
the @entity1 will assume that the guards could be wearing suicide vests and under orders to kill the hostages at the first sign of trouble			2
the ' find , fix , extraction ' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken , so the capture of the militant ' @entity230 ' who executed @entity37 @entity39 and @entity41 - and who threatened mr @entity4 in the video released this week - will not be a priority			1
not a priority : the ' find , fix , extraction ' mission does not allow for prisoners being taken , so the capture of the militant ' @entity230 ' , pictured moments before he beheaded @entity37 journalist @entity41 will not be a priority once the hostages have been freed the exfiltration process begins			1
this will involve moving as quickly as possible to a secure and heavily defended rendezvous point , where the @entity1 and the hostages can be flown out of the target area via helicopter to a safe location , probably @entity9			1
once back at a @entity6 base , mr @entity4 would be flown back to the @entity6 , if necessary on a specially equipped medical flight			0
the key to any military operation is simplicity			0
the more working parts the greater the risk of mistakes			0
the failure of @entity257 , the botched @entity37 special forces mission to rescue @entity37 citizens imprisoned in the @entity259 in @entity260 in 1980 , still lives long in the memory of all special forces units			1
even today the @entity1 's working mantra is ' if it can go wrong , it will go wrong '			0
consequently all plans are based around that assumption			0
and while the @entity1 see it as their duty to ' risk all ' in attempting to rescue a @entity6 hostage , the government is likely to be more cautious with senior advisers assessing the ' cost and benefits ' of a raid , with the obvious fear being mission failure could see members of the @entity1 killed or , even worse , captured .			2

the @entity1 team is *awaiting* orders in @entity9 to rescue @entity4 in @entity3
special forces chief has already briefed @entity282 on likely success of mission
they need to know where he is , how many guards andhow they *'re* armed
but capture of ' @entity230 ' , who beheaded 2 @entity37 prisoners , is not a priority
it *'ll* be second attempt to save him after @entity37 commandos failed this summer
but experts say @entity14 is moving the @entity300 frequently to avoid *detection*
@entity4 was kidnapped 18 months ago from refugee camp where he worked
