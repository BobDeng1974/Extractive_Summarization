@entity0 urged an audience to support @entity2 during a speech yesterday - despite the fact he 's always claimed to be an @entity6 fan			1
the prime minister subsequently admitted he 'd suffered a ' brain fade ' during the election campaign address in @entity10 , where he was outlining his vision for black and ethnic minority communities			1
he said : ' this a country where people of all faiths , all colours , creeds and backgrounds can live together in one place			0
@entity0 looks a bit sheepish after accidentally urging the audience to support @entity2 - though he did n't correct himself until asked about the gaffe afterwards last week the @entity26 leader tweeted his delight at @entity6 reaching the @entity29 final by beating @entity30 ' we are a shining example of a country where multiple identities work			1
' a country where you can be @entity41 and @entity42 and @entity39 , @entity37 and @entity38 and @entity39 , where you can wear a kilt and a turban , where you can wear a hijab covered in poppies			0
' where you can support @entity47 , the @entity48 and @entity49 all at the same time			0
' of course , i 'd rather you supported @entity2			0
' the @entity26 leader was pulled up on the error after the speech , which he read from an autocue , though the party has since admitted it was not included in his prepared text but was an off the cuff remark			1
it was omitted from the official transcript of his speech issued by the @entity26			1
@entity0 blamed his gaffe on a ' brain fade ' like that suffered by @entity64 leader @entity63 earlier in the campaign			2
he said : ' i 'm a @entity6 fan ... i must have been overcome by something ... this morning			1
' but there we are , these things sometimes happen when you are on the stump			1
' the two teams do both play in a claret blue colours - albeit in stadiums 130 miles apart			1
only last week @entity0 tweeted his delight at @entity6 reaching the @entity29 final by beating @entity30 2 - 1 at @entity78			1
he told the @entity79 : ' it was a tremendous game with [ club stars ] @entity82 and @entity83 doing @entity6 proud , against the odds			1
i ca n't wait to watch the final at the end of may			0
' the pm has been a fan since his teens after after he was taken to @entity90 aged 13 by his uncle sir @entity91 , who was club chairman from 1975 to 1982			1
sir @entity91 died last year			0
the pm has been a @entity6 fan since his teens and is pictured here during a game against @entity96 in 2011 @entity97 was one of a number of football fans to lay in to the prime minister on @entity101 over his error his error was swiftly seized upon by his political rivals , as the hashtag # villagate began trending on @entity101			1
@entity107 's former communications chief @entity106 - whose own team @entity108 also play in claret and blue - said the mistake ' says a lot about his character which impacts upon policy			1
' @entity106 said every sports fan would have their ' stomach churning ' to hear the @entity97 apparently forget the name of the team he supported , adding : ' i am sorry but this alone means @entity0 has to go			2
total million percent phoney , as ( @entity6 manager ) @entity123 might say			1
' shadow chancellor @entity126 , a fervent @entity127 fan , tweeted : ' hey @entity0 ... i 'm off to see that football team i support this afternoon			2
name escapes me ... they play in yellow ... @entity132 ? ' but former conservative press officer @entity133 , a fellow @entity6 supporter , said he believed the mistake was down to an error in mr @entity0 's speech			1
' @entity97 is a passionate @entity6 fan			1
takes son to matches ... suspect speechwriter error , ' said mr @entity133			0
soon after the prime minister 's gaffe comedian @entity140 took to @entity101 , creating an amusing new team name			0
he posted : ' @entity0 just remembered his favourite football team is @entity144			0
' while former @entity146 footballer @entity145 posted a video of the ' brain fade ' and wrote : ' @entity0 has forgotten which @entity149 he supports			0
@entity6 last week , @entity2 this			2

' the first mentions in the national press of his liking for @entity6 came after he was elected @entity26 leader in 2005			1
he was reported in 2006 to have written on his blog that he ' half - heartedly ' supported @entity6 and could name only three of their players			2
mr @entity0 was asked about the slip - up in an interview with @entity204 ' @entity203 to be broadcast tomorrow			0
asked to confirm which team he actually supports , he said : ' i 've been an @entity6 fan all my life , i literally opened my mouth and i was going off - piste about the fact that in @entity39 you can be a supporter of the @entity48 , a supporter of @entity47 , and a supporter of @entity49 ' i was then busking about other things you can support and was ... i do n't know what happened to me , it was just one of those things			1
' former @entity107 spin doctor @entity106 , also a fan of a claret coloured team , enjoyed the @entity97 's gaffe asked if it was on the script , he said : ' no , it was n't on the script , i was going off - script to add to the examples , and i suppose it is just the campaign			2
by the time you have made as many speeches as i have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth			0
' asked if he remembered watching @entity6 beat @entity238 in the @entity240 final as a child , he said : ' i do , that 's why i became a @entity6 fan			1
' pressed to say when it was , he replied : ' i 'm not doing quiz time because i 'll get them all wrong , but that 's not what i 'm here to talk about			0
' that 's why i became a @entity6 fan , because my uncle was involved in the club , and back in the early 80s , with all those successes , and @entity254 and @entity255 , and that 's what got me going			1
' but i do n't go very often , in fact i have n't been for years and years , but i try and keep up , and i 'm hoping we are going to escape the relegation zone , which we 're out of now , and obviously the @entity29 final is very exciting			0
' the prime minister ' mistake was soon trending on @entity101 as # villagate			0

' but when they get snug in the middle of the table i tend to sort of , i tend to back off a bit			0
when we get close to the bottom i get nervous , but i do n't know what happened this morning			0
' asked a final time to name the year @entity6 won the @entity240 ( 1982 ) , he said : ' it was early eighties			2
i 'm not going to give you a date because i 'll get it wrong			0
