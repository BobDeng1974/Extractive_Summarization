not a conspiracy — but it turns out @entity1 may have a point about @entity3 , penalties and @entity5 referees after all			1
statistical analysis provided by @entity8 shows an incredible discrepancy between the number of penalties @entity3 receive in @entity13 games and the amount they are awarded in domestic league competition			1
in seven @entity18 fixtures this season , @entity3 have won four penalties , at a rate of one every 1.8 matches			1
in the @entity5 , this skips to just two penalties in 26 games , at a rate of 13			2
@entity1 claims that his @entity3 side do not get the refereeing decisions they deserve @entity3 's @entity29 appears to get pushed over by @entity30 in the recent 1 - 1 draw with @entity32 @entity29 looks bemused after @entity33 refuses to award him a penalty after the tussle with @entity30 @entity3 were denied another penalty against @entity32 when @entity38 's shot hit @entity40 's arm what makes the statistic so curious is that , for the other clubs , the rate at which penalties are won in the @entity5 and @entity13 barely differs			1
@entity46 and @entity47 also find it harder to win penalties in the @entity5 but only by a variation of 0.2 and 0.5 respectively			2
@entity51 actually find it almost twice as easy to earn penalties in the @entity5 as they do in @entity53 , but even then the gap between the competitions only equates to 3.3 matches			1
yet @entity3 take a whopping 11.2 additional games to win a penalty in the @entity5 , compared to their @entity53 form			2
it represents the first corroborative evidence that @entity1 ’s fears his team are getting a raw deal may have substance			0
it makes no sense that the team that has won most @entity5 matches , has the best goal difference and ties with @entity46 for the most goals scored , is not picking up as many fouls in the penalty area			2
@entity3 and @entity46 have both scored 56 league goals this season			0
that ’s a lot of attacking play			0
@entity1 asked specifically to be a guest on television show goals on sunday to air his grievances @entity1 launched into a 27 - minute rant against numerous parties he believed to have wronged @entity3 @entity84 is fouled by @entity51 's @entity85 , leading to one of @entity3 's two league penalties @entity38 is hauled to his feet by @entity90 players after going down in the box at @entity92 yet while @entity46 are awarded a penalty every 3.7 games , such an opportunity for @entity3 comes around once every 13			1
maybe @entity1 is aware of this anomaly and it is fuelling his belief that there is a campaign against his team			0
those not wrapped in @entity3 blue will still find it hard to believe that there is a conspiracy against the league leaders — who would be behind it and what would be the purpose ? yet , certainly , numbers as illogical as this will merely confirm the feeling at @entity92 that they have been unfairly treated too often this season , and it could cost them with the gap at the top now down to five points			1
yes , the margins are small			0
had a foul on @entity29 at @entity32 and another on @entity122 at @entity123 been spotted — both players were wrongly booked for diving instead — then @entity3 ’s aggregate would have fallen to 6.5 in the league , still high but at least in the ball park			0
a ratio of 13 , however , suggests a flawed process , worthy of conversation between the club and referees ’ chief @entity134			0
not a conspiracy , but without doubt it does n’t add up			0
additional reporting by @entity139 @entity3 have won many more penalties in the @entity13 than they have in the @entity5 referee @entity33 has been backed by the referees ’ assessor for his handling of @entity3 's game @entity1 was also angry over the dismissal of midfielder @entity146 by @entity33 against @entity32 @entity146 reacted angrily after a two - footed challenge from @entity32 forward @entity148			1

@entity1 claimed there was a conspiracy against @entity3
evidence has *emerged* showing the @entity154 are hard done by
@entity3 have won just two penalties in the @entity5 this season
but in the @entity13 they have won four from seven matches
