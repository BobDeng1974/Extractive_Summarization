@entity0 have overhauled their backline for saturday 's final test against @entity3 in @entity4 with @entity5 and @entity6 reunited in the centres			1
the experiment of playing @entity6 on the wing has been abandoned after just one match , although head coach @entity11 insists it will be revisited in the future			1
making his first start since the autumn , the revitalised @entity13 returns in the number 14 jersey for the @entity18 encounter			1
@entity19 : @entity6 will return to his favoured position when @entity0 meet @entity3 in @entity4 demoted : @entity21 ( @entity22 ) and @entity23 have been sacrificed to make changes the @entity23 and @entity21 partnership that flourished throughout the @entity26 has been disbanded following the 28 - 27 defeat in @entity28 that completed a series triumph for the @entity3			1
instead , @entity5 and @entity6 have been offered the stage to reproduce the fireworks that lit up @entity32 in the first test in a selection @entity11 insists is based on form			2
@entity23 has paid for his erratic display at the @entity37 with @entity11 admitting it was a ' big step ' for him to play his first match since may 3 in that game			2
fitness was an issue for @entity23 having been sidelined by an ankle injury for six weeks , and while he will be given another chance at a later date , there is a sense that @entity0 are losing patience with the @entity50 playmaker			1
' this is a reflection of us feeling that the centre partnership worked better in first test than in he second , ' said @entity11 , who has picked @entity21 on the bench			1
diving in : @entity13 will take over @entity6 's place on the wing against @entity3 ' we are still finding out which players can and ca n't really deliver at the highest level			1
' we 've had a good chance to look at @entity23 during the course of the season			2
' @entity5 's had one opportunity and he 's taken it			0
now 's the right time to give him a second chance			0
' @entity23 was n't that far off it at the weekend , but when i look at the two games i thought @entity5 edged him			2
' @entity72 's tour - ending knee problem means @entity73 , another standout player at @entity32 , starts at fly - half with @entity75 holding off a strong challenge from @entity77 in the absence of shoulder - injury victim @entity79			1
in a spin : @entity0 coach @entity82 denies that his seven personnel changes are excessive ' @entity73 played well in the first test and the challenge for him is to back that up with a comparable performance , ' @entity11 said			1
following a fine display in tuesday 's 38 - 7 victory over the @entity91 , @entity88 has been chosen ahead of @entity92 to provide specialist cover at 10			0
@entity11 admits he made the decision on the strength of @entity88 's game management at @entity98 's @entity97 as the once - troubled @entity100 playmaker continues his climb back up the pecking order			0
' i was really pleased with @entity79 's 45 minutes against the @entity91 , ' said @entity11 , who admitted @entity92 had been a victim of the fixture congestion that marred preparations for the first test			2
' i needed to see @entity79 start and needed to see whether he could control and run a game as well as do the other bits and pieces			0
i thought he did that really well			0
ballast : @entity110 will provide physicality and intensity as part of @entity0 's front three ' the decision to pick @entity79 was only made after the game			1
i wanted to have a chance to sleep on it and look at it overnight			0
' youngs was disappointing in the first test , but @entity120 has been pleased with the half - back generalship he has displayed while @entity79 has sat out training			0
' i get the sense that @entity75 is approaching the player who played in november 2012 - he 's shown that sort of character so that 's why we 're starting with him , ' @entity11 said			0
@entity128 , lock @entity129 and number eight @entity110 return to freshen up the pack with @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 dropping to the bench			1
@entity137 continues in the second row with @entity11 describing him as @entity0 's ' outstanding forward ' in the series to far			0
@entity141 ( @entity142 ) ; @entity143 ( @entity144 ) , @entity145 ( @entity146 ) , @entity147 ( @entity148 ) , @entity149 ( @entity142 ) ; @entity150 ( @entity146 ) , @entity151 ( @entity146 ) ; @entity160 ( @entity142 ) , @entity152 ( @entity153 ) , @entity154 ( @entity148 ) , @entity155 ( @entity153 ) , @entity156 ( @entity146 ) , @entity157 ( @entity153 ) , @entity158 ( @entity142 , capt ) , @entity159 ( @entity144 )			0
replacements : @entity162 ( @entity148 ) , @entity163 ( @entity164 ) , @entity165 ( @entity166 ) , @entity167 ( @entity164 ) , @entity168 ( @entity50 ) , @entity169 ( @entity153 ) , @entity170 ( @entity171 ) , @entity172 ( @entity153 ) .			0

@entity6 will return to the centre for @entity0 against @entity3
@entity21 and @entity23 have been dropped as a result
@entity75 and @entity73 replace @entity79 and @entity72
@entity13 will fill wide position vacated by @entity6
up front will be @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity110
