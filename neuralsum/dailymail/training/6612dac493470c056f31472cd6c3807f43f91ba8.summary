at just 12 years of age , @entity0 had no idea he was not supposed to be attracted to other boys			1
so when he told his father , a @entity5 missionary from @entity6 , that friends had found a @entity8 - and that he did n't get excited like they did because he only felt that way about his best friend , @entity10 - he could never have predicted the torture that was to follow			1
after being knocked out cold by his father , so hard that he had to be rushed to the @entity13 , @entity0 was repeatedly beaten up before being subjected to months of excruciating aversion therapy			1
freezing ice cubes were placed in his hands while he was shown pictures of men hugging - so that he would associate pain with intimacy between men			1
he was then repeatedly burned when shown similar images but untouched when images of men and women together were shown			1
' @entity35 consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures of explicit acts between men would be shown and i 'd be electrocuted ' eventually , he was subjected to what was called the ' @entity35 '			1
tiny needles were stuck into his small fingers and he was electrocuted repeatedly while shown explicit pictures of men			1
after being excommunicated by his family almost a decade later , @entity0 has spoken about the ordeal he suffered as a child at the hands of his @entity5 community			1
@entity0 was interviewed as part of a series of gay , lesbian bisexual and transgender stories from across @entity54 found by a group called i 'm from @entity57			2
the forum 's founder and executive director @entity58 travelled the country with two colleagues to discover the many untold stories of struggles faced by gay teens in small towns and cities			2
@entity0 , who now studies at @entity68 , described in detail the abuse he suffered as a result of the innocent admission he made to his father when he was a child			0
he speaks of being hospitalised by his father six times before the therapy even began , before describing in detail the ' treatment ' to which he was subjected			0
' @entity78 consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures of explicit acts between men would be shown and i 'd be electrocuted , ' he said			1
after months of torture he considered suicide , climbing onto the roof of the three - storey building where he lived			0
his mother 's attempt to lure him down consisted of her saying : ' i 'll love you again if you just change			0
' fighter : @entity0 was raised in a @entity5 community and was not accepted for being gay story : @entity0 has told of his ordeal to help others who may be going through similar experiences with parents who do n't accept their sexuality ' it 's not the thing to say to someone standing on the edge of a building , ' @entity0 said			2
he eventually came down and convinced his parents he had , in fact , changed - a fa√ßade that he maintained until leaving home for university , and one which brought an end to his brutal therapy			0
after coming to terms with his sexuality away from home , @entity0 returned to come out to them once again			0
