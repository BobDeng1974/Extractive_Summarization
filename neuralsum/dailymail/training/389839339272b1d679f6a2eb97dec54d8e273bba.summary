by @entity0 published : 06:52 est , 4 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:06 est , 4 february 2014 a group of inspiring women in their fifties are proving it 's never too late to get fit by embarking on a workout programme that involves weight lifting and high intensity exercise			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 are all age 53 and admit they have never been fitter than they are now			1
from running marathons to becoming models and changing careers , the women admit exercising has given them the confidence to do things they never believed they were capable of before			1
self - esteem boost : @entity10 always hated having her picture taken but a fitness regime gave her the confidence to become a model @entity10 , from @entity27 , told @entity28 she wanted to get fit at the age of 50 in order ' to be healthy as i entered a new phase of life			1
' however , she never expected her fitness journey to end in a new career and a stint as a model			1
the former hr manager signed up for a fitness programme with personal trainer @entity40			1
@entity40 advocates high intensity exercise that can be done in the home and encourages people to lift weights to tone up and burn fat			2
@entity10 admits she loved the new challenge and coupled her exercise regime with @entity40 's healthy eating advice to limit processed foods , dairy and sugar			1
look at me now : @entity10 , 53 , demonstrates moves using an exercise ball in the @entity55 published book @entity57 fit and strong at 50 : @entity10 got into shape following author @entity40 's advice however , one aspect she disliked was the requirement to take before and after pictures in her underwear so she could track her progress and changing body shape			1
' i have never liked having my photograph taken so that was not the easiest thing to do , ' she admitted			2
@entity10 had never been overweight but by following @entity40 's plan , she became stronger and gained a trimmer , leaner body			1
she said : ' itâ € ™ s hard to see changes in yourself , but it was n't long before my old clothes did n't fit , telling me that an improvement had been made			2
' she also began to grow in confidence and having her picture taken no longer seemed quite so abhorrent			2
when @entity40 was commissioned to turn her weightloss programme into a book published by @entity55 called @entity57 , @entity10 had the opportunity to prove just how far she had come			1
new lease of life : @entity10 never thought she would become a fitness model and has now qualified as a personal trainer she explained : ' in may 2013 , came a totally unexpected request from @entity40 - would i be one of the models in her book ? wow ! what a request			1
i did n't allow myself time to think and immediately agreed			2
' i ca n't in all honestly say that i was looking forward to the photoshoot but at no stage did i regret this decision			2
' @entity10 features in a number of chapters of the book demonstrating the various moves using dumbbells and an exercise ball			1
she said : ' i ca n't believe at the age of 53 i can add " fitness model " to my c.v			1
her new found confidence and love of exercise has also led to her taking a new career path and she has qualified to be a personal trainer and pilates instructor			2
fitter than ever : @entity11 , 53 , completed a tough military - style obstacle race last year @entity11 , from @entity112 , has also found a new lease of life and improved body tone after joining the @entity57			1
she said : ' my body was a bit lumpy and bumpy and i resigned myself that at 53 this was the best i could be			1
' @entity118 and cakes were my downfall and a lung condition gave me an excuse not too work out and feel sorry for myself			2
i found it too intimidating to go the the gym so when i heard i could do @entity40 's programme at home it appealed to me			2
i joined the @entity129 group and having that support and encouragement made me stick with it			2
' @entity11 took 17cm off her waist after taking up the programme and the symptoms of her lung condition abated			2
' i am definitely now smaller and fitter than i was 20 years ago , ' she said			0
last year she also took part in a muddy obstacle race - the @entity139 - with other people she met through the @entity57			0
she said : ' i would never ever done this without this programme and now want to do more			0
' @entity13 , from @entity143 , was another of the @entity144 to take part in the major race			1
she has also completed the @entity147 since turning 50 and has loved taking up weight lifting			1
she said : ' i had never been interested in weights before			0
i 've always had the flimsiest arms and really had no arm strength at all			0
i did n't think i would be able to lift them			0
' but @entity40 advised her to try weighting lifts because she explains : ' adding muscle not only gives your body a firmer , more attractive shape , it improves athletic performance , reduces injury risk , aids mobility and agility , reduces aches and pains , brings a huge range of health benefits and of course makes you strong			0
' after starting with the lowest weight dumbbells , @entity13 's strength increased and she now lifts 8.5kg			1
she recommends other women try weight lifting - whatever their age - and that they should n't be concerned about becoming too bulky			1
she said : ' if you have n't tried weights , give it a go			0
you can start at the lowest of dumbbells like i did			0
you simply do n't get big muscles			0
what you get is toned and stronger , and you can eat more because muscle burns more calories than fat			1
from ' couch potato ' to super woman : @entity13 has toned up by lifting weights and ran a marathon after turning 50 ' i would say that i am fitter than 20 years ago			1
back then although i was very skinny , i had no tone or aerobic fitness			1
now , i would say that i pretty fit for my age			1
' she added : ' it 's never too late to get fit			0
i was a complete couch potato until i was 48 and started running			0
i could n't run for more than 15 seconds at a time then , but three years later i completed the @entity147			0
' i feel pretty body confident now and i can still wear a bikini			0
i am pretty proud of myself for not " letting it all go "			0
' @entity12 , a film editor from @entity196 , has dropped 5st since turning 50 and starting to work out following @entity40 's advice			1
she can now give her two grown up sons a run for their money doing sit ups and press ups			0
she said : ' i used to eat too much			0
wine with dinner were unused calories and had become a daily habit			0
i was amazed at quite how out of shape i was at the beginning of the 12 week programme			0
' now i am a lot fitter , my energy levels now are fantastic			0
' she admits that she was wary of lifting weights at first , especially as the free weights areas of gyms always seemed to be ' men only			0
' she explained : ' the main worry is looking like a male weight lifter , but i learnt that really is n't going to happen unless you take it to extremes and take supplements			0
the only outcome you will get are lovely toned muscles			2
' i invested in a good set of weights so i could use them every day in the privacy of my own home , my weights collection has grown and grown			0
i even have a pull up bar on the door now			0
' she added that she hopes she and her other ' @entity235 ' members of the @entity57 can inspire other women to get into shape and not be afraid to pump iron			1
' it 's never too late in life to try anything , and 50 is nothing these days , ' she said			2
' i want to stay as mobile , strong and mentally alert for as long as i can , that means investing some time now			0
