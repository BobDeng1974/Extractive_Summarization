for anyone with a fear of spiders , having one crawl into your bed and bite you is truly the stuff of nightmares			0
but for @entity10 , the nightmare is still continuing almost two months later , as a bite – believed to have been from the @entity13 ’s most venomous species of spider – nearly caused her to lose her left hand			1
the 48 - year - old woke up in excruciating pain one night in february , and her hand began to swell dramatically			1
recovering : @entity10 woke up in excruciating pain when she rolled over and was bitten by the false widow on the back of the left hand deadly bite : @entity23 from near @entity24 , @entity25 , spent six weeks in hospital recovering from the venomous bite of the false widow she was taken to hospital , where surgeons operated on her three times to remove the poison and decaying flesh and to try to prevent the venom from spreading up her arm			1
at one point her condition was so bad doctors feared they would have to amputate her hand			1
her body temperature plummeted as the skin infection cellulitis set in and an inflamed patch on one of her legs even sparked concerns it had spread via her bloodstream			2
mrs @entity10 has spent six weeks in hospital and is now at home waiting for the infection to leave her body before she can have her tendons , which were left paralysed , rebuilt			1
from the nature of the marks on her hand and her symptoms , doctors believe the culprit is likely to have been a noble false widow spider , named after its similarity in appearance to the black widow spider			2
mrs @entity10 , a former medical photographer who lives near @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ‘ i have been terrified of spiders all my life			1
race against the clock : surgeons operated on her three times to remove the poison and decaying flesh to prevent the venom from spreading up her arm ‘ people tell you it ’s such a silly phobia and they ca n’t hurt you , but now i know that they can			1
’ she added : ‘ for a while the doctors were worried that i may even lose the hand completely and i had to sign for amputation every time i went under anaesthetic			2
‘ every time the surgeons operated they found more and more decay			1
they just kept taking away the dead flesh			2
every time i woke up i made sure my hand was still there			2
’ she continued : ‘ for the first week i felt very poorly and had a very high temperature and felt like i had a really bad case of the flu			0
‘ the pain in my hand was so awful and they operated three times in seven or eight days			1
‘ at the moment it feels like it ’s never going to end			0
‘ i think i would have died if it had gone untreated			0
cellulitis when it gets going can be nasty and there was no question of not treating it			0
’ she said of finding out a spider was to blame for her suffering : ‘ i could n’t believe it until i looked it up on the internet			0
i just thought , “ this is @entity110 for goodness ’ sake ”			0
’ she now wants others to be on guard , saying : ‘ little boys out playing would pick a spider up			0
‘ or they could fall on babies in prams			0
in the old days you used to put nets over prams , but you rarely see them now			0
’ noble false widow spiders are about the size of a 50p piece but have the most venomous bite of any spider in the @entity13			0
they tend to be found more commonly in southern @entity110 but it is thought they are now spreading further across the country due to climate change			0
for the most part , they bite only when provoked , and mrs @entity10 believes she may have caused the one that attacked her to bite after rolling on to it as she slept			1
in february , father - of - one @entity136 , 31 , collapsed after being bitten ten times by a false widow spider on the back and neck in @entity141 .			1

@entity10 was bitten on the back of her hand
toxic venom caused flesh to *rot* and began spreading through her body
surgeons operated three times to save her hand
