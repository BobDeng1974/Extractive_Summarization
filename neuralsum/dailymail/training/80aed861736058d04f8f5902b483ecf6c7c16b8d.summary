president @entity0 believes that marijuana is not as dangerous as alcohol and that the ban in most states unfairly targets the poor and minorities			1
in an interview with the @entity8 , the president stated that marijuana use is not something that he would suggest for his daughters or anyone else , but prohibition has become a problem for the @entity15 ' as has been well documented , i smoked pot as a kid , and i view it as a bad habit and a vice , not very different from the cigarettes that i smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life			0
i do n’t think it is more dangerous , ' mr @entity0 said			1
@entity27 view : in an interview with the @entity8 , president @entity0 stated that he believes marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol marijuana has been a taboo topic for politicians , and even caused former president @entity34 some troubles while running for office in 1992 when it was revealed he smoked pot while studying in @entity38 , and he responded that he ' did n't inhale ' and ' did n't try it again '			1
president @entity0 on the other hand , has been far more candid , admitting to smoking pot and even taking cocaine in his 1995 memoir @entity43			0
' i think that , at this stage , my life is an open book , literally and figuratively , ' he said while running for @entity47 in @entity48			0
' voters can make a judgment as to whether dumb things that i did when i was a teenager are relevant to the work that i 've done since that time			0
' by 2008 , voter sentiment across the @entity15 had relaxed on the issue of marijuana enough that it did n't seem to factor much in his campaign			0
in the @entity8 interview , mr @entity0 clarified that he believes pot is less dangerous than alcohol ' in terms of its impact on the individual consumer			1
it 's not something i encourage , and i 've told my daughters i think it 's a bad idea , a waste of time , not very healthy			0
' but the most troubling aspect of the federal ban on marijuana is it 's impact on specific segments of the population - especially african - americans like himself			2
the future : @entity15 opinion seems to be falling in line with mr @entity0 following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in @entity82 and @entity83			1
above , a legal @entity85 dispensary ' middle - class kids do n’t get locked up for smoking pot , and poor kids do , ' he said			0
' and @entity91 - @entity15 kids and @entity93 kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties			0
' ' we should not be locking up kids or individual users for long stretches of jail time when some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done the same thing , ' mr @entity0 added			1
following the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in @entity82 and @entity83 , the tide seems to be turning towards a more liberal view of pot usage			1
the president said it 's important for legalization to happen in @entity82 and @entity83 because ' it ’s important for society not to have a situation in which a large portion of people have at one time or another broken the law and only a select few get punished			2
' at the same time , mr @entity0 believes legalizing marijuana is going to be a challenge for the two states , and that legalizing the substance nationwide lead society in the wrong direction			1
' i also think that , when it comes to harder drugs , the harm done to the user is profound and the social costs are profound			2
and you do start getting into some difficult line - drawing issues , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' if marijuana is fully legalized and at some point folks say , well , we can come up with a negotiated dose of cocaine that we can show is not any more harmful than vodka , are we open to that ? if somebody says , we ’ve got a finely calibrated dose of meth , it is n’t going to kill you or rot your teeth , are we o.k. with that ? '			0

in an interview with the @entity8 , mr @entity0 said that the federal ban unfairly targets minorities and the poor
however he says legalization in @entity82 and @entity83 will be a ' challenge '
if legalized on the national level , he says it could lead to a *slippery* slope with harder drugs
