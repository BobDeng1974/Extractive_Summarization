by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:38 est , 16 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:13 est , 16 december 2013 @entity3 had a stroke in 2012 and has since had a vagus nerve stimulator around 150,000 @entity6 a year suffer a stroke			1
@entity3 , 42 , a taxi driver from @entity8 , @entity9 , had one last year and underwent a new procedure to help him recover movement in his arm , as he tells @entity13			1
after driving my taxi around @entity16 one sunday in may 2012 , i went to fitness training and then to my granddaughter @entity18 ’s first birthday party			2
i fell into bed , exhausted			2
my next shift was due to start at 4am			2
but when my wife @entity22 woke at 5am , i was still asleep			2
she shook me to wake me up , but no matter how hard i tried , i could n’t get up - my right leg was numb			2
nor could i move my right arm or hand , and i could n’t speak			2
i ’d try to move my mouth but could n’t think of the words			2
i had tests at @entity30 in @entity31 , including an mri scan of my brain , and was told i ’d had a stroke			1
i was shocked - i was fit with no risk factors such as a family history or smoking			2
i spent three months in hospital , doing physiotherapy to learn to use my body again			0
but i was still left in a wheelchair and could barely speak above a whisper			0
my right arm hung uselessly , supported by a sling			0
luckily , i ’m left - handed , so i could feed @entity45 three or four weeks , i learned to walk again using a stick , and had speech therapy and physiotherapy			1
but my right hand was next to useless - i could move my fingers but barely raise my hand			0
the physiotherapist said to keep trying to move it so my brain could learn new @entity55 still could n’t form words , so i ’d point to things to communicate with @entity22			1
she stopped work as a taxi driver to become my carer			0
she even had to dress me			0
after my speech therapist told me about a trial of a new device that could help , i saw dr @entity64 at the @entity65 in @entity66 in july			1
he asked me to lift a tiny ball bearing and a marble to test my strength and dexterity , but i struggled and dropped them			0
even lifting a baseball cap from the table was difficult			0
dr @entity64 told me a nerve stimulator would be fitted around my vagus nerve , which runs from the brain to the abdomen			1
the stimulator ( the size of a matchbox ) would be implanted in my chest and linked to an electrode wrapped around the nerve in my neck			1
it sends electrical signals to activate the nerve to prompt my brain to release more chemical messengers ( neurotransmitters ) that help make connections in the brain			1
the stimulator would be fired while doing my arm rehabilitation exercises and would hopefully retrain my brain to do the actions			1
@entity3 pictured before the stroke			1
he underwent three months of physiotherapy the one - hour operation took place in august under general anaesthetic and i left the next day with dressings on my neck and chest			0
i had six weeks of physiotherapy , when doctors fired the stimulator using a remote control			1
at first , i struggled to reach a bottle on the table , but after a few weeks i could do it			0
when the stimulator was on , i felt an odd tickle in my throat but it did n’t hurt			1
week by week , i improved			0
gradually , i could lift a baseball cap above my shoulder , and pass a newspaper from my damaged right hand to my left			0
doctors ca n’t say for sure if it is due to the stimulator , though			1
now i only use a stick on long walks , i can drink tea and dress myself again			0
it ’s been a long haul , but i ’ve been told i should keep improving - and by next year i hope to be driving again			1
dr @entity64 is clinical senior lecturer in medicine at the @entity129 and consultant physician at @entity66 and @entity131			0
strokes occur when the brain is damaged by blood supply being interrupted by a blood clot or a ruptured artery			1
it can interfere with speech or memory and leave weakness in arms or legs			1
do n't put off visiting your gp if you experience worrying symptoms			0
two in five @entity6 residents admitted to doing this , according to a new survey from @entity149 , and as a result , one in five had to be prescribed a stronger course of treatment			0
when asked why they put off visiting their gp , half of respondents thought symptoms would clear up on their own and more than one in three did n’t want to waste their gp ’s time			0
weakness down one side is common after a stroke and often the arm recovers poorly , because rehab usually focuses on getting patients walking , and complex functions in the hand need a lot of input from the brain			1
despite the damage , new connections between brain cells can form , probably mediated by neurotransmitters			1
effectively it means the brain can rewire itself , so different parts do jobs usually done by the damaged part			1
patients have extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation to stimulate this			0
many are left with permanent one - sided weakness			0
our trial aims to tackle arm weakness with a device to stimulate the left vagus nerve ( the right one controls heart rate , so could cause it to drop if used )			1
around 90,000 patients worldwide have had vagus nerve stimulation for conditions such as epilepsy and depression , but this is the first time it has been used for stroke rehabilitation			1
stimulating the nerve can prompt production of more neuro - transmitters ( the nerve is linked to important networks of brain cells )			1
we are testing to see if doing this during physical therapy helps the brain re-wire more effectively			1
this is designed for arm movement , but it has potential for other body parts affected by stroke			1
in the trial , all the patients will have extensive physiotherapy , but half will also have the vagus nerve stimulator fitted			1
the operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic			0
first , we make a 5cm incision in the side of the neck above the vagus nerve			1
moving blood vessels to one side , we wind the last 2cm of the electrode - a 15 - 30cm long thin wire - around the nerve			1
now he only uses a stick on long walks , can drink tea and dress himself again we then make a 6cm incision on the left side of the chest , between the collarbone and the nipple			0
this is where we implant the 1cm thick matchbox - sized stimulator , which is stitched into place			2
we then plug in leads from the stimulator to the electrode ( tunnelled under the skin ) and close the incisions with stitches			2
most patients go home the next morning			0
when patients return for rehabilitation exercises two weeks later , we use a remote control linked to a laptop to fire the stimulator			2
it sends an impulse to the electrode wirelessly , which stimulates the nerve			1
during two - hour rehab sessions , we fire the device repeatedly as the patient attempts to do tasks.the implant can remain in situ for life as it ’s virtually risk - free , which means we can continue giving therapy if it ’s beneficial			0
so far , three patients we ’ve finished treating with the stimulator responded well , while one did n’t have much response			2
this compares with two having a good response to just the rehabilitation ( two had a poor response to that )			0
when the trial finishes next summer we should see if the implant produces greater improvements			0
there is a 1 to 3 per cent chance of damaging the vagus nerve , says dr @entity64			1
as the nerve stimulates vocal cords , it can cause a hoarse voice			2
this is rare and usually temporary if it happens , although there is a very low chance this could be permanent			0
there is a small risk of nerve damage , which could cause drooping eyelids and facial @entity293 risks are very low since this is a straightforward procedure , adds dr @entity296 , consultant neurologist at the @entity298 , @entity299 , and @entity300 , @entity301			2
' @entity303 nerve stimulation has been used for other conditions , so we know it ’s safe			2
the main risk is it not working			0
all operations carry small risks of bleeding and infection			0
’ the operation costs the @entity313 about £ 10,000 and is available only through the trial			0
it is recruiting in @entity66 and @entity315			0

@entity3 , 42 , from @entity8 , had a stroke last year
speech therapist *suggested* nerve stimulator be fitted around vagus nerve
sends signals to activate nerve to prompt brain to release neurotransmitters
