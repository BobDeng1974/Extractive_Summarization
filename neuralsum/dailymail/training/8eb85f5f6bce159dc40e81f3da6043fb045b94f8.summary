@entity0 is yet to know what it feels like to be knocked out of a cup competition as @entity5 manager			0
tonight , he might experience it for the first time			0
the winners of last season 's @entity9 – who also won the @entity12 – are staring down the barrel of a last - 16 elimination at 2 - 0 from the first leg against an @entity17 side who have already beaten them in three different competitions this season			1
@entity23 will parade his @entity24 before the game while @entity26 will show off his @entity28 prize for last year 's best goal			1
@entity5 - based daily sports paper as has already held a séance to call on the spirit of former player @entity33 to inspire a comeback – but all that might not be enough against the might of @entity17			1
@entity23 ( left ) and @entity36 stretch their legs during @entity5 training on wednesday @entity0 's side are two goals down ahead of their second leg @entity9 against @entity17 @entity44 midfielder @entity43 ( centre ) is set to start in midfield against @entity48 's side @entity23 poses with his @entity24 trophy as he returned to training with @entity5 on tuesday real coach @entity0 ( centre ) poses with award winners @entity53 ( left ) , @entity54 ( second left ) , @entity23 ( second right ) and @entity26 ( right ) , who won the @entity55 for best goal coach @entity48 has spoken of the feeling of invincibility his team have in two - legged affairs , scoring twice at the @entity61 without conceding means they go into this game as favourites despite a doubt over striker @entity67 who has a virus			1
if he fails to make it then it could be a memorable return to the @entity71 for @entity72			0
' he is here to give us experience and goals when the team most needs it , ' said @entity48 in the build - up to the game			2
his players were snubbed in the @entity81 team of the year announced at @entity82 on monday without a single player making the @entity84 and that will only fire them up more in - front of a global audience			0
' i am not imagining a calm game ; i 'm imagining an intense one , ' said @entity48 who added : ' we have a positive result from the first leg but we are up against the world and @entity96 club champions			2
' @entity48 ( left ) has overseen three victories already this season against @entity0 's all - star side @entity100 celebrates his goal during @entity17 2 - 0 win against @entity103 in the first leg @entity104 strokes home his penalty after being brought down by @entity5 captain @entity53 in the box @entity36 and @entity23 stare on in disbelief as @entity5 slump to defeat against @entity17 @entity5 are expected to start the game with @entity36 , joining @entity23 and @entity110 in the so - called @entity112 front three			1
@entity36 was criticised for not passing to @entity110 in the opening defeat of 2015 against @entity114			0
and he was then in trouble for not passing to @entity23 at the weekend against @entity116			0
' i do n't think it was so easy for him to make the pass , ' said @entity0 , as he defended the player who scored the goal that won @entity5 the @entity9 last season			1
he also confirmed that @entity36 's relationship with @entity23 was ' excellent '			0
@entity5 's frightening front three have proved too much for defences all over @entity127 and beyond across the last 18 months but @entity17 have frequently frustrated them			2
@entity48 issues instructions to his team from the sidelines at the @entity61 stadium @entity48 has won 16 of 19 knockout matches he has taken charge of and since @entity17 beat @entity5 in the @entity9 final in 2013 – ending 14 years without a victory over their neighbours – they have beaten them four times , drawn twice and lost on only three occasions			1
@entity23 will be wearing his new micro-diamond encrusted boots to celebrate his third @entity24 win			2
that is unlikely to do much to lessen the desire @entity17 have to turn over their wealthier city neighbours one more time			0
