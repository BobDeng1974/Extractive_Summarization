a tv show about the excavation of second world war graves has been cancelled after a barrage of criticism about its approach from archaeologists , one of whom labelled it a ‘ disgrace ’			1
@entity10 was due to air on may 13 , but @entity11 said it has removed it from its schedules ‘ indefinitely ’ while it reviews how the programme was made			1
episodes of programme would have seen two metal - detecting specialists , a @entity19 relic hunter and an @entity21 military antiquities dealer ' hunt down stories of war and uncover relics ' from ' remote forests and fields of @entity27 '			2
controversial : the show features four war diggers excavating @entity31 relics in @entity27 but archaeologists were inflamed after a gruesome preview video appeared on the channel ’s website , which showed the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in @entity39			1
at one point , the men mistake a leg bone for an arm bone after wrenching it from the ground			2
dr @entity46 , the director of the centre for @entity48 at @entity49 , labelled the show a ‘ disgrace ’			1
he said : ‘ i ’m appalled that a major broadcaster has sunk to the levels of exploitation television			2
i ’ve been at the forefront of battlefield archaeology for fifteen years , and i have spent much time getting the subject taken seriously			2
anger : archaeologists were inflamed after a gruesome preview video appeared on the channel ¿ s website , which showed the presenters extracting various body parts from a muddy grave in @entity39 ' this just looks like they ’ve gone around digging up bodies , because tv likes a dead body			1
’ dr @entity46 regarded the way in which the programme ’s presenters handled human remains as being particularly insensitive			0
he added : ‘ this shows no evidence of even the most basic archaeological principles - this is treasure hunting not archaeology			0
' i have seen human remains brandished like trophies before but in dodgy youtube videos			0
the fact that this comes from a commissioned tv series is quite beyond belief			0
‘ the trailer on the internet was absolutely shocking , and very damaging for @entity11			1
’ dozens of archaeologists have left comments on the @entity11 website , lambasting the channel for what they see as a grotesquely insensitive intrusion into a gravesite			1
barrage : dozens of archaeologists left comments on the @entity11 website criticising the show ‘ you are sensationalizing and promoting the looting of archaeological sites and the disrespect of human remains , ’ wrote @entity100 of the @entity101 of @entity102			1
‘ you should be ashamed to profit off these destructive activities disguised as “ science ”			0
’ dr @entity110 of @entity111 , @entity112 , who specialises in research into the illegal antiquities trade , is incensed at what he has seen			0
‘ based on the preview video , the @entity10 did n’t record their finds properly , ’ he said			1
‘ they did n’t take out the material carefully			0
to me , it looks untrained and unsupervised			0
if i tried to excavate a skeleton like that on a dig i would have been stopped and thrown off the site			0
it ’s slapdash and it destroys evidence			0
’ scrapped : @entity11 said it will pull @entity10 from its schedule indefinitely at first @entity11 tried to defend the programme saying ‘ the series operates in direct conjunction with organizations officially licensed to excavate battlefields ’			1
but now it ’s pulled the plug , saying in a statement : ‘ @entity136 , in consultation with colleagues at the @entity139 , announced today that it will pull the series @entity10 from its schedule indefinitely while questions raised in recent days regarding allegations about the program can be properly reviewed			2
‘ while we support the goal of the series , which is to tell the stories of long lost and forgotten soldiers , those left behind and still unaccounted for , and illuminate history working in concert with local governments and authorities , we also take seriously the questions that have been asked			0
’ the programme had been commissioned by the satellite channel from the same company that made @entity156 - the controversial feature aired on @entity158 in october where couples had sex in a sound - proofed box before being interviewed about the experience in front of an audience .			2
