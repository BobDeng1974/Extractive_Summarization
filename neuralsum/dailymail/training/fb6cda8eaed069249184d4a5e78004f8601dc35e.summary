by @entity0 published : 11:37 est , 19 august 2012 updated : 05:56 est , 20 august 2012 tensions between @entity2 and @entity3 threatened to boil over yesterday in a row over a group of disputed islands			1
around ten right - wing @entity2 activists swam ashore the main island in the @entity10 archipelago and raised the national flag			2
they carried out the stunt to call on @entity3 to give up its claim to the islands , which are under @entity2 control			1
the uninhabited islands , which the @entity3 call @entity10 and @entity40 also lays a claim to , are hotly disputed because they lie close to rich gas fields and are situated in a vital shipping lane in the @entity28			0
the activists , who belong to a group whose name translates as ‘ @entity47 in there , @entity2 ’ , travelled to the islands with 150 other people in a flotilla , which had ostensibly set out to commemorate @entity2 citizens who died nearby in @entity53 the @entity55 activists arrived in the island chain at dawn today on a flotilla of boats carrying a total of 150 people			0
disputed : this picture shows an aerial view of @entity64 @entity2 coastguards , aware of the row that would follow if any of them landed on the islands , ordered them to sail away			0
but a determined dozen strapped on life jackets and swam to the rocky shoreline of the main island , @entity10			0
they said that not only would they raise the flag on the coastline rocks , they would sing @entity2 ’s national anthem , have a fish meal , and then carry the flag to the island ’s highest point , where it would be planted			0
when news of the assault reached @entity32 , the @entity3 issued an immediate rebuke and more than 100 people gathered near the @entity2 consulate in @entity3 ’s southern city of @entity88 , demanding the @entity2 leave the islands			1
anger : when news of the assault reached @entity32 , the @entity3 issued an immediate rebuke			1
protesters carried @entity3 national flags at an @entity96 protest in @entity97 , south @entity3 's @entity98 province unhappy : people hold banners as they attend a rally protesting against @entity2 's claim of the islands the @entity3 state - run @entity105 news agency said @entity108 rallies were also held in @entity97 , @entity109 and @entity110			1
@entity3 foreign ministry spokesman @entity111 had warned even before the flotilla set out that ‘ any unilateral action taken by @entity2 on the @entity10 is illegal and invalid			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity3 has made solemn representations to @entity2 , demanding that it immediately cease actions harming @entity3 ’s territorial sovereignty			2
’ the islands are important to @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity40 because they lie on a vital shipping lane , but more importantly they are surrounded by deposits of gas			2
tension : protestors overturned @entity2 cars following a protest in @entity97 , @entity3 's @entity98 curious : a @entity3 boy looks at an overturned @entity2 car officially , the @entity2 flotilla set out to commemorate the @entity2 who died near the islands in @entity53 , but diplomats in @entity133 and @entity32 were convinced that was just a cover story			1
the real reason for the landing , it was being widely accepted , was to counter a similar landing by @entity3 activists last week			0
they had managed to get ashore , despite a @entity2 coastguard vessel firing a water cannon at a boat carrying the group			0
the @entity3 activists were deported shortly after landing on the island – but it is believed it was their action that resulted in the @entity150 group arranging their own assault			2
as the @entity2 protest voyage was setting off , mr @entity153 , a politician from @entity154 , near @entity133 , said the trip was about who owned the archipelago			1
‘ i want to show the international community that these islands are ours			0
it is @entity2 ’s future at stake			0

the *dramatic* assault by a dozen @entity2 nationalists infuriated @entity3 , which issued an official protest to @entity133
it sparked a number of *anti-japanese* rallies across @entity3
