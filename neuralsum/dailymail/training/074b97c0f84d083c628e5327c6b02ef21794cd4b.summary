by @entity1 reporter published : 10:04 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 06:06 est , 6 july 2013 they were unveiled to much fanfare as a cool new addition to @entity6 's streets			0
but the state - of - the - art @entity8 buses have left passengers fuming after a faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar			1
heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across @entity17			1
the problem on the new double - deckers , christened ' @entity31 ' after the @entity6 mayor who introduced them at a cost of £ 354,500 each , is caused by air - conditioning faults and the absence of opening windows			1
@entity38 today admitted the buses had ' teething problems ' and encouraged concerned passengers to complain			1
the problem led to the buses being branded ' cauldrons on wheels ' after windows were omitted by their designer @entity46 — best known for his @entity48 cauldron			1
he feared that they would ' ruin the efficiency ' of the on - board cooling units			2
temperatures recorded at 1pm yesterday on the upper deck of a no 24 bus reached @entity56 , more than @entity57 hotter than outside			1
humidity hit 77 per cent — almost double that on the @entity60 and 15 points higher than @entity63 countries such as @entity64			0
unveiling : a proud @entity6 mayor @entity65 poses next to one of the new @entity8 buses which are being rolled out across the capital last month route 24 , between @entity70 and @entity71 , became the first run entirely with the new buses			1
@entity38 is to roll out 600 of the buses , built by @entity75 in @entity76 , by 2016 at a cost of £ 212 million			1
@entity78 , which runs between @entity79 and @entity81 @entity80 , will convert on september 21			0
the buses , described by the mayor as ' a brilliant feat of @entity86 engineering ' , were first trialled on route 38 — where several continue to operate alongside conventional double - deckers — 18 months ago			2
@entity89 , operations director for @entity90 , told the @entity28 : ' we are aware of some technical issues with the ventilation and air chill system on some of the @entity6 vehicles on @entity96			2
our suppliers are working to fix the issue as soon as possible			0
' sauna on wheels ' : the new @entity8 bus has been slammed for leaving passengers sweltering in the heat problem : designer @entity46 feared windows would ruin the efficiency of the air conditioning units on the new @entity108 as you would expect with the introduction of a large fleet of new buses , there will be teething problems and we are working hard to minimise the impact of these on our customers			1
' passengers went on @entity119 to express their fury			2
one described the conditions as ' hotter than magma '			0
another dubbed the buses ' moving saunas '			1
others called on @entity38 to hand out water to passengers			2
the problem was revealed as @entity38 published its ' beat the heat ' plan for summer — and as forecasters warned that @entity6 was set to experience the hottest day of the year on sunday , with a @entity134 peak			0
replaced : the much - loved older routemaster bus , pictured , was phased out in 2005 in favour of newer , more efficient , models nursery nurse @entity138 , 25 , from @entity70 , said : ' everyone i know hates the buses			2
' they look nice but there are no windows and the air conditioning does n't work			0
' and at night they close the back doors so you 're completely shut in			0
it was so hot the other day i thought i was going to faint			0
' @entity38 said : ' we ask any passenger who feels our service falls below what they expect — for example the bus air cooling system not working — to contact us			0
concerns will be fully investigated			0
