some swear by @entity1 , others by a strong black coffee			0
but the best way to cure a hangover is to tuck into a fried breakfast , a leading researcher has claimed			2
@entity8 , professor of psychology at @entity10 , says the carbohydrates in a full @entity12 will help restore depleted sugar levels			1
tuck in : the carbohydrates in a full @entity12 will help restore depleted sugar levels after a heavy night of drinking speaking ahead of the annual meeting of the international @entity18 , he said the best hangover cures are those that provide glucose			1
he told the @entity22 : ' one of the mechanisms of the hangover is to do with glucose metabolism and not having enough blood sugar			2
' in @entity30 , one of the most prevalent hangover cures is a big fried breakfast - fried eggs , sausages , baked beans , and all the rest - that â€™s well - renowned as a hangover cure in @entity30 , and it probably does work because there are lot of carbohydrates in that meal			1
and that will restore depleted sugar levels			1
' he admits on occasions when he has overindulged , a fried breakfast ' works wonders '			1
professor @entity8 , himself a member of the @entity18 , added that anti-inflammatory drugs ( such as ibuprofen ) can also help , as can the migraine drug @entity54 acid and the herb borage			1
and hair of the dog ? speaking to @entity22 journalist @entity59 , he explained that once the ethanol in alcohol has been broken down by the body , it tackles other alcohols such as methanol , which can cause feelings of sickness			0
@entity68 : anti-inflammatory drugs can also ease a hangover , as can the migraine drug @entity54 acid , says professor @entity8 however if you drink more , the methanol wo n't be broken down - the body simply goes back to processing the ethanol			1
hence why continuing to drink can stem the pain of a hangover			2
a study last year revealed why we crave a fry - up when we 're hungover			0
researchers at @entity83 found we are hardwired to want fat - and alcohol kills our willpower			0
' all mammals gravitate to eating the most energy - dense foods , ' explained @entity90 , professor of human ecology and nutritional sciences			0
' and fat is the most energy - dense food available			0
' sober , you may not give in to those cravings , but after a night of boozy indulgence , you lose such learned inhibitions as disciplined eating , @entity90 added			0
and the other good news ? hangovers decline with age , he says .			0
