a number of politicians have described wind farms as a blight on the landscape – a sight so ' appalling ' , they could slash the value of your home by a third			1
but new market research in @entity10 has revealed that these towering turbines have no effect on property values of nearby homes , commercial properties or farms			1
the researchers hope that their unexpected results may help resolve some heated debates about the use of wind farms near residential areas			1
hot air : new market research in @entity10 has revealed that towering wind turbines have no effect on property values of nearby homes , commercial properties or farms the study , by the @entity28 , looked at more than 7,000 homes and farm sales in 11 townships in @entity33 , @entity10			1
this included @entity35 , which is home to one of @entity33 's first and largest wind farms after 133 turbines were erected there between 2005 and 2008			1
researchers looked at sales data over an eight - year period - from 2002 to 2010 - to capture property values before , during and after the wind farm 's development			1
during that period , more than 1,000 homes and farms were resold - some multiple times			2
and in every case , they found wind farms had ' no statistically significant effect ' on property values			1
the study ontradicts research earlier this year by the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) which found that values of homes within 1.2 miles ( 1.9km ) of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent the researchers had expected to find a negative correlation , especially for residential properties			1
' this may help address the controversy that exists in @entity33 regarding the impact of wind turbines on property values , ' researcher @entity61 said			2
last year , @entity67 , conservative mp for @entity68 and @entity69 , said some homes in his area are now worth ' significantly less ' thanks to giant turbines , and that it is an ' injustice ' that homeowners should lose out while developers and land owners potentially pocket millions			2
mr @entity67 says proposals for scores of turbines have pushed rural areas to ' tipping point ' and has called for a new scheme to compensate those whose homes are affected			0
the mp said : ' an increasing number of people are coming to me with clear evidence that the value of their home is significantly less than what it otherwise would be were the wind farm not there			0
' he added : ' i ’m seeing a minimum 10 per cent to 15 per cent reduction			0
some are seeing a loss of one - third of the value ... how can that be fair ? ' ' how can it be right that landowners and developers are making millions of pounds , while the ordinary household is losing the value of what is their pension , or nest egg in old age			0
' a current court battle in @entity33 about wind energy developments involves families in @entity114 and the @entity115			0
across the province , residents have called on the government to delay wind farm development until the impacts are better understood			0
but similar opposition to wind farms is taking place across the world			1
in the @entity126 for instance , nearly 25,000 objections were lodged against proposals to build wind turbines the ' size of skyscrapers ' across @entity132			0
' it 's been in the news for a while now , and it seems to be generating more and more concerns among local residents , ' said @entity61			0
' i wanted to see whether the stories people are telling and the concerns that they are expressing show up in the sales data			0
' this research , which was recently published in the journal @entity143 , is the first peer - reviewed study on the subject			2
it contradicts research earlier this year by the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) which found that values of homes within 1.2 miles ( 1.9km ) of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent			1
the study looked at more than a million sales of properties close to wind farm sites over a 12 - year period			2
this means that if such a wind farm were near an average house in @entity126 , which now costs almost £ 250,000 ( $ 391,100 ) , it would lose more than £ 27,000 ( $ 42,250 ) in value .			0

study , by the @entity28 , looked at more than 7,000 homes
many of these were near wind farms , but house prices *remained* stable
researchers hope that their results may help resolve debates on issue
it contradicts research earlier this year by @entity54
this study found that values of homes within 1.2 miles ( 1.9km ) of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent
