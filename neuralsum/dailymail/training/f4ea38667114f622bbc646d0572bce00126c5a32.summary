by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 7 january 2013 updated : 04:55 est , 8 january 2013 her dresses sell out within hours of her wearing them ; her hairstyle is copied in salons across the country			0
but all those seeking to emulate the duchess of @entity11 ’s style no longer have to pore over photographs			2
they can simply consult @entity15 ’s complete guide to @entity16			1
from the diameter of her curls to the number of teeth she shows when she smiles , nothing has escaped the fashion bible ’s scrutiny			0
ahead of her 31st birthday tomorrow , the magazine has analysed outfits the duchess has worn since her marriage to prince @entity30 in april 2011 , plus a handful from before the couple ’s engagement – 100 in total			1
so to be a true copy @entity16 , you should wear blue , ensure the average drop of your earrings is 33mm – and carry your clutch bag with both hands			1
according to the guide , when it comes to her clothes , @entity16 ’s favourite colour appears to be blue , which she has worn on 24 per cent of occasions			1
from peacock to @entity49 , it is her out and out favourite			0
she also favours red ( 13 per cent ) - which she wore for the occasion of the @entity54 - followed by white ( 12 per cent ) and , less popularly with the public , grey ( 11 per cent )			2
next on the list is purple ( 9 per cent ) , multi coloured or patterned outfits ( eight per cent ) pink ( seven per cent ) and green ( six per cent )			2
cream and yellow both languish at the bottom of the league table on five per cent			0
by far and away most outfits worn on her last 100 official engagements come from top end @entity68 store @entity70 - worn on 28 public engagements			1
but designer @entity72 , whose outfits cost several thousand pounds apiece and who the @entity9 chose to design her wedding dress , is her next favourite label with 14			0
other designers in @entity16 ’s top five are @entity79 ( six ) , who has designed some of her most stunning evening dresses , and @entity82 ( eight )			1
once the high street queen , @entity83 languishes at seven ( probably because the firm have a huge store just a short hop from her home at @entity89 )			0
but surprisingly @entity95 , the label @entity16 wore to meet @entity92 president @entity91 and @entity93 at @entity94 , does not even register			1
@entity15 have even made it their business to scrutinise the length of the @entity9 ’s sleeves - finding that 6:1 being the most commonly seen arm - to - sleeve - length ratio			1
‘ all the better to display the royal wrist - bling , ’ it says			0
the magazine estimates that on her most recent tour of @entity106 and the @entity107 , the @entity9 took along 61 items of clothing , footwear and accessories worth around £ 1,427 per outfit ( compared to the late @entity113 whose tour outfits costs the modern equivalent of £ 4,270 a pop )			0
@entity16 ’s other most talked - about asset is her glorious tumbling tresses and the magazine has even , unbelievably , worked out the average diameter of her curls - 25mm			2
@entity9 goes for a glossy ‘ @entity122 blow dry ’ 73.4 of the time - a perfectly achievable goal if one , like @entity16 , has a hairdresser on call 24 hours a day			1
just like on her wedding day , she favours a chic half - up half - down do 13.6 per cent of the time , wearing it either naturally loose and curly or in a ponytail 6.5 per cent of occasions			0
her accessories are equally closely monitored			0
apparently the @entity9 has perfected the tilt of her hats and fascinators - always to the right at a stylish 50 degree angle - to show off her enviable cheekbones			0
the average dimension of her favourite clutch bags is 194mm by 132 mm and she carried them as thus : one handed 31 per cent , left hand over right 15.5 per cent , right hand over left 5.5 per cent , hands together 48 per cent			2
her favoured shoe designer is the upmarket @entity148 - sported on 13 public engagements out of the last 100 - closely followed by @entity151 ( well you would do , would n’t you ? ) at nine official events			1
the analysis found @entity16 favoured the colour blue , having been seen wearing it on 24 per cent of occasions , while green dresses only made it to six per cent even her earrings do not escape scrutiny - the average drop measuring exactly 33 mm. one of her favourites pairs is a glittering sapphire and diamond set once owned by @entity30 ’s mother , the late @entity113 , @entity166 , who sported them on the cover of @entity15 in july 1994			1
seventeen years later , on her july 2011 official tour to @entity170 , @entity16 wore them in public again after having them slightly remodelled			1
creams and yellow languish at the bottom of the table at five per cent , according to the study , which analysed everything including the length of her sleeves even her teeth do not escape the eagle eye of the fashionistas			0
apparently the @entity9 , who is believed to have had her teeth whitened and straightened by ‘ micro-rotation ’ - using invisible braces attached to the back of each tooth - shows an average of 8.6 teeth when she smiles			0
