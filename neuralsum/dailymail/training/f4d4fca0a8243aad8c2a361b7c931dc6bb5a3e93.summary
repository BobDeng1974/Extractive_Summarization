maj. @entity10 did n't elaborate when he announced his strategy today , shortly after a military judge agreed to allow him to represent himself			1
but it was the first time @entity10 hinted at his reasoning behind the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than two dozen others on the @entity3 post			1
representing himself : maj. @entity10 will defend himself at his trial for the 2009 @entity5 shooing rampage @entity10 also asked for a three - month delay to prepare his new defense			1
