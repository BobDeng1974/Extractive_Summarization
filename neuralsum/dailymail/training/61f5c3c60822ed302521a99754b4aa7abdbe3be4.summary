by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s best - paid presenters are in revolt against plans to axe their tax - saving freelance contracts			1
the corporation had promised the government it would stop paying staff through ‘ personal service companies ’ that can attract a lower rate of tax			1
but it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals			1
star names : it is understood presenters including @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) are among those who use personal service companies , which attract a lower rate of tax @entity25 , @entity20 and @entity21 are all paid in this way			1
those whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end their off - payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance			0
but by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a @entity2 pension and other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per cent			2
instead of caving in to the demands , many have refused to sign staff contracts , leaving the @entity2 to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept defeat			2
an insider to the negotiations described the situation as chaos , adding : ‘ the @entity2 is in an impossible position			2
its own staff have it over a barrel			0
‘ it has promised to change the way it pays its people , but is powerless to do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are all acting as one			0
the bottom line is the @entity2 ca n’t afford to lose its top people			2
’ the personal service company arrangements have been branded ‘ staggeringly inappropriate ’ by the commons public accounts committee , which suggested the @entity2 could be complicit in tax avoidance			1
the rate of corporation tax – which companies pay on profits – is up to 20 per cent lower than the income tax that high - earning individuals face			2
top names : @entity25 ( left ) channels his earnings through a company whose most recent accounts showed it had £ 218,000 in the bank			0
@entity79 ( right ) , a presenter on @entity77 ’s today programme , disclosed she paid herself £ 165,000 through her personal service company in the past financial year last night , @entity82 mp @entity81 , who sits on the public accounts committee , said the failure of the @entity2 to resolve its pay arrangements was extremely disappointing : ‘ it shows the weakness of the senior management of the @entity2 that undertakings of openness and transparency have come to nothing			1
’ more than 6,000 @entity2 freelancers are paid through personal service companies , allowing them to be taxed as companies rather than individuals			1
mr @entity25 , who hosts the flagship @entity101 show @entity103 , channels his earnings through a company called @entity100 its most recent accounts showed it had £ 218,000 in the bank			0
his freelance contract has not yet come up for renewal , meaning he has not yet been forced to consider whether he will sign a staff contract			0
@entity79 , a presenter on @entity77 ’s today programme , disclosed she paid herself £ 165,000 through her personal service company in the past year			1
the sums may include fees from outside engagements such as speaking events			0
there is no suggestion any of the individuals on the contracts have acted improperly or deliberately sought to avoid tax			0
mr @entity25 claimed in 2012 that the @entity2 had ordered him to form a company if he wanted to continue to present @entity103			1
@entity2 : @entity119 is already in a battle with stars over plans to axe tax - saving freelance contracts one of the few presenters to sign a staff contract is today presenter @entity126 , who agreed to come on to the books last year			1
@entity128 , a talent agent whose @entity2 clients include @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , said : ‘ in my opinion the @entity2 – with its huge internal resources – has got into a real mess on this one and after spending a great deal of time and money trying to resolve it has only created more confusion and frustration			0
’ a @entity2 spokesman said last night : ‘ from november last year the @entity2 has been applying a new employment test to all on - air television presenters			2
if the result of that test shows employment , talent have been offered on - air talent employment contracts			0
‘ there is no truth in claims that television presenters are refusing to move to staff roles			0

@entity2 said it would stop paying staff through ' personal service companies '
but it could have to back down in face of anger among best - known stars
@entity25 , @entity20 and @entity21 understood to use @entity162
