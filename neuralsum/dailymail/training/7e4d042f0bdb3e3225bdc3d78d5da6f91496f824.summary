by @entity1 reporter last updated at 9:50 am on 18th july 2011 if you were packing to go into space , you 'd be forgiven for leaving your hairbrush behind			2
but astronaut @entity5 may now be regretting not paying more attention to her hair , as pictures of her wild barnet beam around the world			1
the wacky ' do is the result of the zero - gravity conditions on board the @entity14 , where dr @entity15 and her fellow crew - members were snapped talking to president @entity18			1
when the astronauts came on the line , the president said : ' oh , i was just dialling out for pizza and i did n't expect to end up in space			1
' later in the call , he referred to the fact that 10 people - four members of the shuttle @entity40 and six residents of the space station - had to share the station 's two toilets and @entity40 's sole toilet			1
in this picture dr @entity15 is earthbound , and so is her hair ' my wife and daughters are always crowding me out â€” hopefully you all have a better arrangement up there , ' he quipped			1
the main themes of his conversation were praise and thanks for the shuttle program 's service			2
' i know that there have been thousands who have poured their hearts and souls into @entity64 's space shuttle program over the last three decades that are following this journey with special interest , ' he said			2
' to them and all the men and women of @entity71 , i want to say thank you			0
you helped our country lead the space age , and you continue to inspire us			0
' @entity5 enjoys the upside of zero gravity as she floats about in a capsule @entity40 is in the midst of a 13 - day resupply mission to the space station			1
its landing , currently set for next thursday , will spell the end of the 30 - year space shuttle program			1
@entity40 and its two sister shuttles , @entity86 and @entity87 , are to be retired to museums			0
@entity18 said @entity71 would continue to push the frontiers of space exploration and human space flight in the post-shuttle era			1
the @entity28 has set a goal of sending astronauts to a near - @entity96 asteroid by 2025 and to @entity97 and its moons by the mid- 2030s			1
in the meantime , commercial space taxis will be developed to resupply the space station , and eventually take astronauts up as well			0
joker : speaking to the crew of 10 @entity18 could not resist slipping in a joke or two @entity18 noted that @entity40 ' crew is leaving behind a @entity64 flag that was flown on the very first shuttle mission , to be turned over to the first crew to arrive on the station on a @entity64 commercial spacecraft			1
' i understand it 's going to be sort of like a " capture the flag " moment here for commercial spaceflight , ' @entity18 said			1
' so good luck to whoever grabs that flag			0
' @entity40 ' commander , @entity118 , said : ' we sure hope to see some of our commercial partners climbing on board really soon			0
' earlier in the day , @entity40 ' crew fixed another one of their main computers after it failed and set off an alarm that shattered their sleep			0
@entity71 declared all five of @entity40 ' primary computers to be working , pending evaluation of the latest shutdown			0
