by @entity0 correspondent published : 17:33 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 07:34 est , 23 july 2013 @entity2 's girl : the @entity4 ' private secretary @entity3 at the @entity5 on monday the @entity6 and @entity7 will not be hiring a nanny to help them with their young son , but there is no doubt that their team of trusted advisers that supported them through monday 's royal birth will be there every step of the way			1
including the medical team , their private secretaries and their security guards , the @entity19 have a close group of people to stand by them			1
the girl friday no twin - set and pearls for @entity3 , a vicar ’s daughter who has worked as the duchess ’s private secretary since her engagement was announced in 2010			2
when the @entity32 bumped into her yesterday , she was , as almost always , a virtual ‘ copy @entity2 ’ , in skin - tight skinny jeans , sling - back canvas wedge heels and a pair of over-sized sunglasses			1
but do n’t let her casual get - up fool anyone			2
@entity41 , as she is known to her friends , is @entity2 ’s indispensable girl friday			1
the 30 - year - old is typical of the young team who have set up shop at @entity47 , where blue blood counts for remarkably little			1
the youngest of three sisters , she was brought up by her mother , @entity51 , after her father , @entity52 , an army major , died in 1986			2
after working as a house mother at @entity57 prep school in @entity58 , her mother was ordained as a priest and is now a vicar at @entity61 , in the tiny @entity63 parish of @entity64			2
@entity0 was a pupil at the exclusive @entity65 in @entity66 before studying @entity67 at @entity68			2
her ‘ big break ’ came when she worked behind the scenes on @entity70 and @entity72 ’s 2007 @entity71 as a producer ’s assistant and won plaudits for her coolness under pressure			2
she was subsequently absorbed into @entity70 and @entity72 ’s private office and , when @entity70 ’s engagement was announced , moved to work for @entity2			1
last year she was officially promoted to private secretary , the most senior role in the duchess ’s household			2
‘ in a very short time , @entity0 has become one of the central figures in the duchess ’s life , ’ said a source			0
strong support : @entity7 of @entity91 and @entity3 , 30 , who has been @entity2 's private secretary since last year all eyes : members of the world 's media gather outside @entity96 as they wait for news of the birth of the first child of @entity6 and @entity2 eagerly awaiting : thousands gathered outside @entity101 , eagerly awaiting the easel which proclaimed the birth of a healthy baby boy and signed by @entity2 's doctors the @entity106 @entity107 's aid : the @entity91 's private secretary @entity109 affable but sharp as a tack , @entity109 is @entity70 ’s private secretary and is at the heart of a core band of advisers guiding the couple through the early stages of their public life together			1
educated at @entity119 ’s , a small public school in @entity121 , the 34 - year - old is not much older than his employer but brings to the role a wealth of experience outside of royal circles			0
he joined the @entity128 press office in his early 20s and worked his way up , serving as the liaison with @entity131 when @entity72 went to war in 2007			0
editors agreed a media blackout to allow lieutenant @entity135 to serve in @entity137 , but he had to be pulled out when foreign media broke the embargo			0
@entity109 ’s performance in handling such a delicate situation – not least because of @entity72 ’s ire – hugely impressed the princes , who hired him to head their press office			0
in the role , @entity109 , who owes his name to his @entity147 mother , managed to earn both the respect and trust of his principals			0
as a result he was promoted to the coveted position of private secretary to the @entity91 last year after his long - standing predecessor @entity155 ( a more traditional ex-army and ex-courtier figure ) withdrew to an overseeing role			1
@entity160 , as he is known to his friends , is believed to be the first senior royal aide to enter into a civil partnership with his long - term partner in 2011 , the same year his boss wed. like many members of @entity70 , @entity2 and @entity72 ’s ‘ unstuffy ’ private office , @entity109 and his staff prefer to undertake their team bonding sessions over karaoke and chardonnay			1
the medical team ' he was this big ! ' obstetrician @entity173 and surgeon - @entity175 @entity174 and @entity176 depart the hospital after delivering the baby boy of @entity6 and @entity2 the @entity180 ’s own surgeon - gynaecologist , @entity174 , was in charge of the birth			1
a devoted grandfather himself , the 69 - year - old has attended the @entity180 for more than 20 years			0
he also delivered both of the @entity188 ’s children , @entity189 , nine , and @entity190 , @entity191 , four			0
the countess collapsed and was close to death when @entity189 was born prematurely in 2003 , after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb			0
mr @entity174 also led the medical care following @entity188 ’s ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and performed the @entity200 ’s hysterectomy in 2007			1
obstetrician @entity173 is a specialist in high - risk pregnancies and dealing with women who have had repeated miscarriages			0
he works at @entity205 ’s private @entity204 and on @entity206 having amassed 16 years ’ experience as a consultant			0

the ' vegas cop ' : @entity220 , famous for being photographed with prince @entity72 during his trip to @entity222 earlier this year , was leading the @entity19 ' security team yesterday the @entity224 the couple ’s team of @entity228 police bodyguards were yesterday led by one of their most experienced officers , @entity220			1
married mr @entity220 was photographed organising the convoy that whisked the duchess to hospital ( a far more sober experience given that the last time he was photographed was sitting with prince @entity72 in a pool in @entity222 )			1
he was also in charge of the prince when he was partying in the private suite at the exclusive @entity241 , where @entity72 was photographed with a young woman playing naked billiards .			1
