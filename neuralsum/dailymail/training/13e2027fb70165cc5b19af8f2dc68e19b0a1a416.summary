by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 5 may 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 5 may 2012 a model who caused a car crash after drinking so much sparkling wine she could hardly say her own name has walked free from court			1
@entity10 calendar beauty @entity8 , 38 , was almost four times the limit and could barely stand after she shared two bottles of @entity13 with friends at a business meeting			1
but despite arranging a lift home , the blonde - a single mother to a six - year - old boy - decided to drive home after the networking event with a cosmetics company			2
ashamed : @entity8 walked free from @entity23 @entity22 on her way home she ploughed her @entity26 car into a stationary taxi , drove on and was seen stopping and starting , swerving across the road and mounting a grass verge			1
a police officer who eventually stopped @entity8 near her £ 200,000 apartment in the village of @entity33 , @entity34 , said she was so drunk he could only understand the word ' @entity8 ' as she slurred out her name			1
she was also so unsteady on her feet the officer had to hold her up to stop her falling over			2
although the model gave a roadside breath test , @entity8 was too inebriated to give a second breath sample back at the police station			1
magistrates in @entity23 were told she woke up in a police cell the next morning unable to recall any of her drunken driving jaunt the night before			1
@entity8 , who models at @entity47 and featured on the @entity49 calendar , yesterday admitted failing to provide a breath test and was given an eight - week jail term suspended for 12 months			1
she was also ordered to complete a six month community order during which she ill have to attend alcohol awareness course			2
she was further banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £ 100 costs			1
earlier @entity55 , prosecuting , said that at 11.10pm on february 16 taxi driver @entity56 was parked in @entity57 when he heard a crunching sound			1
banned : the model will not be allowed to drive for two years he saw a silver @entity26 drive off , with a blonde woman with a ponytail driving			1
he took down the registration and called the police			1
a police officer , who had taken down the details on making his way through @entity70 village towards @entity71 , saw the @entity26 five minutes later			1
' it was swerving and kept stopping and mounted the grass verge , ' said mr @entity55			2
' she was on her own in the car and when officers asked her to get out , her speech was slurred and they could smell intoxicants on her breath			2
' they asked her name but could only understand " @entity8 " ; they could not decipher anything else			1
' they had to assist her because she was falling over			2
' a roadside breathalyser showed a reading of 138microgrammes ( mg ) of alcohol in 100 mililitres of breath			2
the legal limit is 35mg			1
@entity8 was then to @entity93 police station but could not provide breath tests			1
she was blowing into the bag to softly and then blowing too hard before speaking to the policeman			0
he asked if there was any medical reasons as to why she could n't but she said no. the court heard @entity8 had attended a meeting that evening between 4pm and 9pm with a cosmetics company and she drank @entity13 with friends			1
her lawyer , @entity105 , said : ' she had no recollection of driving and arrangements had been put in place to leave her vehicle at the networking event			1
' she had left the event to put her bag in the car but it seems to be one of those cases where she was so intoxicated that she made a drunk and irrational , stupid and out - of - character decision to drive			0
' her friends sent her text messages asking where she was			0
' instead of depositing her heavy handbag she drove			0
' she had suffered a head injury and had no recollection of the incident , effectively waking up in the cell			2
' this can be attributed to alcohol			0
' she has no memory of what went on in that road and in the police station			2
it was n't even a wilful refusal to give a breath sample - she made several attempts			0
' at first she blew too hard and then too softly then started to speak to the officer about her son and lost concentration			0
' she was effectively too drunk to do it			0
' it is not lost on her how serious this is and what disastrous consequences could have followed			0
' you will see from the report that she accepts full responsibility for the offence and has apologised to the taxi driver			0
' she has been extremely scared about what could happen to her and she regrets her actions			0
' she has been torturing herself about what went on on that night and what could happen			0
' she works hard to provide for her son with little or no support			0
in terms of credit , she has provided a guilty plea			0
' it would be a disaster for her and her child if she was taken into custody			0
' she is at a low risk to harm to the public			0
' this was a one - off offence			0
it is not somebody who has a significant alcohol history			0
' this has been a wake - up call for @entity168 and it is unlikely that court will ever see her again			2
' passing sentence , magistrate mr @entity172 told @entity8 : ' you were so intoxicated that you had no recollection of what happened but you have expressed remorse			1
' however , we believe you have behaved recklessly and and you placed yourself and other road users in extreme danger			0
