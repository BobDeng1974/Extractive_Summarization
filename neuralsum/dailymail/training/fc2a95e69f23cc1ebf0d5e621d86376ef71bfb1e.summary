around 100 prehistoric ' cult sites , ' containing phallic carvings have been found in the @entity2 in the @entity3 in @entity4			1
the sites date back around 8,000 years , and archaeologists were stunned to find a variety of stone structures and artifacts			1
they include stone circles that measure 1.5 to 2.5 meters across with penis - shaped installations pointing toward them			1
researchers found a variety of stone structures and artifacts , including stone circles that measure 1.5 to 2.5 meters across with penis - shaped installations pointing toward them in addition to the penis - shaped structures , researchers also found that some of the stones have vulva - shaped holes cut into them , which the team describe as ' pear shaped '			1
the researcher team say the sites were used by cults to worship fertility and death			2
it it believed animal sacrifices took place , and theat hundreds of the sites exist			1
' while a comprehensive stylistic study of the stone objects is still ongoing , a preliminary interpretation suggests two symbolic aspects , ' the team , led by @entity39 , a researcher with the @entity41 - @entity40 and the @entity42 , wrote			2
' one is fertility , represented by the stones with elongated perforation ( vulva - shape ) and by the very combination of the elongated cell and the circle			0
' death is ' signified by the burial of stone objects and by setting them upside down , ' the team members wrote in their paper			0
in one , a humanlike stone carving was found buried with ' only the very top visible on the surface			0
' other findings there include standing stones that reach up to 2.6 feet ( 80 centimeters ) high , stone bowls and stone carvings that have a humanlike shape			1
these sites are often clustered together , and in one area the team discovered 44 cult sites in a spot encompassing only 0.8 square kilometers ( less than 200 acres )			0
' taking in [ to ] consideration the topography , environmental conditions and the small number of known @entity76 habitations in the general southern @entity3 , the density of cult sites in this region is phenomenal , ' the team , led by wrote in an article published recently in the @entity84			1
archaeologists are working to decipher any meaning from the artifacts and structures , and say that both death and fertility seem to be symbolized at the sites			1
a pair of installations , where the elongated cell points to the stone circle			0
they also say similar sites are found throughout the area			0
' although the majority of these sites is currently recorded in the @entity103 mountains , they were also found in other regions of the @entity3 and in southern @entity105 , and therefore they represent a broad phenomenon			1
' the many cult sites stand in contrast to the small number of @entity76 habitations known in the @entity3 and they offer a new insight into the spiritual culture of the desert @entity76 societies			0
' a survey of a larger area yielded to date 349 cult sites , @entity39 said , adding that researchers are preparing these finds for publication			1
' the number of cult sites recorded to date suggests that many more still await discovery , ' the researchers wrote			2
' many more may be found on the mountains of the @entity3 , southern @entity105 and @entity127			0
' a survey of a larger area yielded to date 349 cult sites , @entity39 said , adding that researchers are preparing these finds for publication			2
one ' may think now of a vast phenomenon , of hundreds of mountain cult sites in the desert			2
' the sites also provide a good view			0
' commonly , a broad view is seen from the sites , so possibly , the scenery was one element in the selection of their location , ' the archaeologists added			0
' the fact that they are still visible today , thousands of years after being used , indicates that they were frequently visited , for short events , during a significant period of time and by many people			0
' since many sites contain several installations ( up to eleven ) and numerous stone objects , support the view that at least some sites were not just temporary .			2

sites in the @entity103 mountains contain phallic stone structures
contained stone circles with phallic carvings pointing to the centre
researchers believe hundreds more sites may exist in the region
