worried : @entity0 attended the class at @entity2 after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand an outraged mom live tweeted her son 's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance			1
author @entity0 took to @entity13 to express her horror at what she heard at @entity2 , in @entity16 , when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week			1
ms @entity0 , a respected professor , began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex			1
according to the 45 tweets sent by ms @entity0 during the lesson , stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant , people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts			1
' the whole lesson here is " sex is part of a terrible lifestyle			1
drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster " , ' tweeted ms @entity0			1
she added : ' i feel like raising my hand and saying " can i tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? " ' ms @entity0 also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students , who are freshmen in high school , by the teacher , who did not normally work at the school			1
at one point , paper babies were handed around the class to show how ' easily ' condoms fail : the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times			2
" we are going to roll this dice eight times , ' ms @entity0 reported the teacher as saying			1
' every time your number comes up , in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby			2
' in fact , according to the @entity70 , just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly			2
outrage : ms @entity0 's tweets , above , show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week untrue : the school has denied it only teaches abstinence , saying it just happened to be that day 's lesson the tweets went viral , with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education			1
but the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day 's lecture which focused on the subject			1
' abstinence - based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe , but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices			1
this parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught , ' high school principal @entity91 said in the statement released to @entity96			1
the school has taken no direct action against ms @entity0 for the tweets			1
they have , however , banned her from the premises - apart from her son 's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson			1
