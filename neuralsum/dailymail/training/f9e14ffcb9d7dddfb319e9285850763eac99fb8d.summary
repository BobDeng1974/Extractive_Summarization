by @entity0 @entity1 could soon be flying to the @entity2 and @entity3 as part of the budget carrier ’s plans for expansion			0
ceo @entity8 has revealed the airline is looking to develop the business in @entity11 , to use it as a hub for flights to destinations including @entity15 and @entity16			1
on monday , reporting a 152 per cent surge in first quarter profits , @entity8 said he would be ‘ very keen ’ to expand into @entity11 as it was revealed the carrier had submitted an expression of interest in @entity23 at the request of the @entity11 government			1
last week , @entity38 airlines were forced to pull out of @entity39 for 24 hours following a rocket attack , while carriers have rerouted planes flying over @entity43 - and over war - torn eastern @entity45 following the downing of @entity48 ’s flight @entity49			0
speaking about the airline 's plans , mr @entity28 said he would be very interested in using @entity11 as a base to develop new routes			1
he explained : ‘ we are not particularly interested in @entity23 , which has huge legacy issues and historic losses			2
‘ we would however be interested in growing our business in @entity11 and we would be very keen to base additional aircraft there			1
’ the airline could offer budget flights from @entity11 to places like @entity15 , the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity3 international routes from @entity11 to destinations outside @entity67 , which could include budget flights to @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity3 , would require a licence to fly beyond the @entity71 ’s borders			1
@entity8 added : ‘ if we are going to put aircraft in @entity11 , we would need to have a @entity11 air operator ’s certificate ( @entity75 ) so we could go from @entity11 into some of the @entity2 destinations			1
‘ the problem for us is that once you go out of the @entity71 we can only fly from @entity80 because we go back to being an @entity80 airline with an @entity80 aoc			2
‘ but there are other places where it would make sense to have some flights ; from say @entity11 to places like @entity15 , the @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity3			2
so we ’re looking at a @entity11 aoc			0
’ @entity1 was among nearly 20 companies to submit a non-binding expression of interest			0
the process is a preliminary step towards any eventual binding offer by any bidder			0
@entity23 has struggled to survive against cheaper competitors and has been loss - making for years despite several attempts at a turnaround			0
the airline has recently resorted to selling assets to stay afloat , including its slots at @entity101 's @entity100			0
‘ we 're happy to work with them on all of that , ’ said @entity28 , who has discussed expanding @entity11 tourism with the government .			2

ceo @entity28 said airline wants to use @entity11 as a base
will allow carrier to fly to destinations including @entity15 and @entity16
