unpopular opinion : @entity2 columnist @entity1 wrote a column published thursday titled ' joining the military does n't make you a hero ' as the nation remembered the deadliest attack against the @entity10 military in history , the @entity2 sparked controversy by publishing a column against the hero - worship of our armed forces			1
columnist @entity1 wrote a piece called ' joining the military does n't make you a hero ' in which he argues that idolizing those who volunteer for military service is relatively new and distracts from the ' disgraceful ' treatment of veterans			1
@entity1 's comments were generally ridiculed online , with many @entity28 users furious that the opinion piece was published on the 73rd anniversary of the attack on @entity32 - a military disaster which resulted in the loss of 2,402 @entity10 servicemen and led the @entity10 to enter @entity36 in his column , @entity1 writes that society has only recently started holding military members on a lofty pedestal , a development he believes is due to the military now being volunteer - only , which creates a ' small , self - contained caste ' of soldiers ' cut off from the @entity10 mainstream '			1
since @entity10 no longer lose their civilian husbands , brothers or sons to conscripted service , most are unaware of what war is like and @entity1 says that ' distance ' leads to the development of ' extravagant fantasies about soldiers '			2
' if we believe our soldiers are superheroes , it makes sense to send them to faraway battlefields to solve our perceived problems in the world , ' @entity1 writes			2
pointing to sporting events , where it has now become routine to bring a soldier out on the field or court at halftime for a salute to his service in @entity72 or @entity73 , @entity1 writes that these rituals feed ' the fantasy that military service turns one into a better , more selfless human being '			2
while @entity1 says it is justified to admire soldiers who have performed brave acts , he critiques the idea that a uniform ' automatically ' turns ' ordinary people into giants '			0
scroll down for tweets does n't agree : iraq war veteran and champion logroller @entity89 was one of the man on @entity28 to voice outrage over @entity94 's opinion piece			1
pictured on the left with president @entity96 in 2007 , when the then - senator was running for the @entity98 ultimate sacrifice : @entity89 lost most of the right hand when his vehicle was struck by an ied in @entity72 in 2006 @entity1 says there are plenty of other heroes outside the military , like nurses , teachers and community organizers who deserve equal praise			1
he adds that this kind of idolatry distracts from the way ' scandalous ' way veterans are treated , citing high rates of unemployment , mental illness , homelessness , addiction , and suicide among retired servicemen ' the soldier acknowledging cheers at a ball game is a fantasy figure we can easily admire			0
veterans in need are more disturbing , so we keep them invisible			0
if we truly considered our uniformed fighters heroic , we would show them real gratitude rather than the phony kind that gives us a shiver of momentary pride but does them little good , ' @entity1 writes			0
the article did n't receive a very warm welcome online , as several @entity28 users , including a few veterans , lashed back at @entity1 for his opinion			1
@entity145 veteran and champion logroller @entity89 , who lost part of his right arm in 2006 after his vehicle was struck by an @entity102 , was one of the first to respond , writing : ' according to @entity1 , being a community organizer is on par with being a soldier shipping off to war			0
' others felt @entity1 's piece was inappropriate to publish the column on a day the nation was mourning the @entity32 attacks			1
' you 're seriously defective and f * * * * * in the head if you choose today to s * * * on the military			0
seek help , ' one impassioned @entity28 user wrote			0
however , some @entity28 users did write that @entity1 made compelling points in his argument that turning soldiers into superheros fuels the @entity10 war machine			0
before becoming a columnist for the @entity2 , @entity1 spent more than 20 years working for the @entity169 as a foreign correspondent			2
during his time at the @entity169 , @entity1 covered stories in @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			1
@entity1 also teaches international relations at @entity177 and contributes to @entity178 and @entity179			0
