@entity0 is testing an @entity2 app that helps him run the country			0
developed by the @entity5 , it is called the ' number 10 dashboard ' , and lets @entity0 and other ministers see key information at a glance			1
a description of the app says that ' with a few taps or swipes of his fingers , he can see very quickly what important new information has come to light , how certain government services are performing , and a selection of relevant and important news reports '			1
the app is hosted by the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) inside the @entity5 , and consists of a number of onscreen tiles , each of which can be selected to show more detail			1
they include : mr @entity0 has been using it to keep track of live data relating to jobs , housing and other areas , it has been confirmed			1
@entity41 , one of the developers behind the project , worked with him , giving him early versions of the app and getting direct feedback			0
' it 's a dashboard to give the prime minister and other senior official the most up to date view of government priorities from housing to national business or growth , ' she said			1
' they will have access to the latest government and external data , as well as commentary and analysis by top analysts in the government			1
'' when the prime minister opens up the app the first thing he will see is a page giving him the daily political context			2
miss @entity68 worked with the pm to develop the project			0
' this had been built with the prime minister			0
' it was incredible valuable to speak to my users , but my favourite thing he said was that he was looking forward to showing it to @entity78 at the @entity79			0
' miss @entity68 said mr @entity0 ' in particular liked the statistical side , where we could give him quotable facts about what was going on , ' she said on a website about the project			0
' it also monitors polls and posts on social media , allowing the @entity69 to instantly see reaction to policies and news events			0
much on the work on the app has been around making it simple to understand , and the @entity5 said data would be ' visualised in a very simple , easy - to - digest way			2
' the @entity5 said the app would be offered to more government figures next year			1
mr @entity0 is ' looking forward to showing it to president @entity78 at the @entity104 ' , a person working on the project told the @entity105			0
mr @entity0 's @entity2 was a gift from @entity106 , according to a gift list disclosed by the government , and he has previously admitted to being a huge fan of the game @entity111			2
the new app , which is actually a web page , was developed by the @entity5 's digital team and takes data from sources including @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 , putting them on a single page			1
the app is believed to resemble the data.gov.uk site with large tiles showing key information the @entity5 confirmed to the @entity105 today it was ' working on a data visualisation dashboard to provide ministers and civil servants with information on key public services as well as other indicators			1

the app is believed to have a look and feel similar to that of the government 's data website , data.gov.uk			1
a cabinet office source confirmed to the @entity105 that the app , which is still in its testing phase , is currently on the prime minister 's @entity2 , as well as devices used by a select group of staff within the @entity5			0
it is believed the app will be rolled out across @entity25 next year as part of a major digital overhaul			1
' if you want to provide ministers and officials with information about performance of government , you can look at government data - but you can also look at data from the real world , ' said the source			1
' all we 're doing is bringing government into line with what leading companies , big and small , have been doing for several years			2
' it 's radical for government , but it 's not radical for 2012			2
