when it comes to such a hair - raising hobby , nothing stalls these adventurous youths in @entity13 as they bring a whole new meaning to the term ' off road '			1
the latest craze among young @entity13 men is dubbed ' sidewalk skiing '			2
it involves a driver racing along before manouevring - most likely with the help of a ramp - the vehicle onto its side			2
' dangerous driving ' : young men demonstrate the latest craze in @entity13 known as ' sidewalk skiing ' hold on ! there is not a backseat driver in sight because the passengers are clinging on for dear life outside the daredevil group like nothing more than to step it up a gear when it comes to hitting the road near the northern city of @entity41			1
to describe it as ' dangerous driving ' would be putting it mildly , with motorists who perform such stunts risking life and limb - not to mention their licence			1
the highway code goes out of the window and there is not a backseat driver in sight when these adrenaline junkies are showing off their skills			1
instead , the passengers prefer to cling on for dear life on the outside of the vehicle as it tears along on two wheels at breakneck speeds			0
and in a large middle eastern country made up largely of desert , there is plenty of open road for them to pursue their testosterone - fueled pastime			0
open road : ' @entity71 ' is performed at breakneck speeds close to the northern city of @entity41 risking life , limb and licence : onlookers cheer as a truck is driven over a young man sat in the road buckle up ! the highway code goes out the widow , along with the passenger during this stunt to make matters even more dangerous , the driver is literally joined by hangers - on who attempt to stay aboard on the outside of the vehicle			1
some even take to sitting in the @entity91 and allowing the truck to speed over them			0
it has proven to be a popular spectator ' sport ' as well , with excited onlookers cheering with delight as the action unfolds before them			0
but onlookers would certainly be advised not to try this at home - not least because it would be next to impossible with the long tailbacks regularly clogging up @entity105 's roads			0
wheels of fortune : one wrong move by the driver could be deadly for those inside the vehicle eat my dust : the craze of ' sidewalk skiing ' brings a whole new meaning to the term ' off - road '			0
