injury : @entity6 needed reconstructive surgery after being hit in the face by a garage door accident : the incident occurred earlier this month at the plumber 's home in @entity9 , pictured but mr @entity6 , a former rugby player , says the accident could have been much worse - if the square corner of the door had hit him , he could have lost the sight in his eye			1

' i had gone into the garage and was bending down to pick something up when i must have knocked the arm out of place , ' mr @entity6 said			2
' i did n't even manage to pick up what i had bent down to get , when i was hit on the right side of my face with the metal bar			0
' as soon as i did it happened i knew that it had caused some serious damage - i looked in the mirror about 30 seconds after and that side of my face had just completely swollen up			2
agony : but mr @entity6 , pictured left before and right after the accident , was lucky not to lose the sight in his right eye thanks to the injury ' when my wife saw my face she went into a blind panic			1
even though i 'm annoyed that it happened , i do feel that i was actually lucky that it was n't a lot worse than it was			0
' i was hit with the middle part of the bar , but if it had been the square end of the bar which had hit me then i would have most likely lost my eye			0
' after going to @entity67 , mr @entity6 underwent a scan on his face which revealed that the damage to his face was worse than initially thought			2
he added : ' after the accident i went to see an eye specialist and luckily my eye is ok and i did n't need any treatment			0
' the scan i had showed that the injuries below the skin were a lot worse than what they thought from looking at my face , and there was a lot of trapped nerve and muscle damage			0
' during the week pain was gradually getting worse			0
now i have had the operation the pain has eased slightly but i 'm still struggling to eat			0
