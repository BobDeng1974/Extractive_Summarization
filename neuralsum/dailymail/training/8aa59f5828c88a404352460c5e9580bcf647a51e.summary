by @entity0 for the @entity1 it is the stage when a husband and wife finally have the chance to spend time together , free from the stresses and strains of working life			0
but far from being an era of relaxed contentment , retirement can be a stressful experience for couples			0
many wives begin to suffer from ‘ retired husband syndrome ’ once their men give up work , academics have claimed			1
experts claim that women can suffer ‘ stress , higher depression or inability to sleep ’ once their husbands retire and arguments are common ( file picture ) they discovered that nearly half of women complained of increasing levels of stress , depression and sleeplessness after their other half retired			1
and to make matter worse , the @entity38 researchers also found that with every extra year the husband spent in retirement , the wife ’s condition became worse			2
they said that the affliction does not only affect housewives , but can be even worse for women who are still working while their husbands stay at home			1
in 1984 , an @entity48 researcher called @entity49 collected anecdotal evidence about @entity22			1
wives of retired men told him : ‘ i ’m going nuts ’ , ‘ i want to scream ’ , ‘ he ’s under my feet all the time , ’ ‘ i ’m nervous ’ , and ‘ i ca n’t sleep ’			0
his clinical description of the symptoms of the stress - induced conditions , included : headaches , depression , agitation , palpitations and lack of sleep			1
the new study supports his findings with empirical evidence			2
a @entity67 report suggested that over 60 per cent of older @entity69 women are affected by the syndrome and there are soaring divorce rates			1
‘ we have found that retirement effects are stronger for employed women , who are already stressed by their job and have less time to comply with the additional requests by their retired husbands , ’ they said			1
part of the cause of greater stress was that women were faced with an increase in housework , the authors reported			1
they also had to deal with the added burden of reduced income , an extra concern for both partners			0
the research was carried out by social scientists dr @entity93 and dr @entity94 , from the @entity95 , who analysed interviews with 840 @entity69 women between 2008 and 2013			1
they chose @entity69 because the country is thought to have strong traditional gender roles			1
but the researchers said their results could apply to many countries , because the effect was even more pronounced when both partners had worked			2
they gave each woman a retired husband syndrome ‘ score ’ depending on the extent of their emotional problems			2
they found that for every extra year the husband spent in retirement , the score increased by 6 to 14 percentage points			0
the authors , writing in the @entity119 journal , said : ‘ after a life apart and progressive estrangement , many @entity69 couples are forced to start spending time together when the husband retires			2
‘ this can be a very stressful experience for wives , who suddenly have to face the continuous presence of a stranger in the house and the additional burden of his requests			0
’ the scientists said that the condition does not only affect housewives , but in fact can be even worse for women who have been working for years they found that 47 per cent of wives reported emotional problems when their husbands had retired – 41 per cent were more stressed , 23 per cent said they were depressed and 16 per cent had experienced sleeping problems			1
the theory of retired husband syndrome was first established 30 years ago by @entity48 doctor @entity141			0
wives of retired men told him , ‘ i ’m going nuts ’ , ‘ i want to scream ’ , or ‘ he ’s under my feet all the time ’ , he wrote in 1984			0
his theory gained much attention , but the new study is the first to demonstrate it is true on a large scale			0
dr @entity93 and dr @entity94 said their evidence showed retirement could be tough for men too			0
and as their mental health and moods declined , life in turn became yet harder for their wives			0
‘ the estimated effects are almost identical among both partners , suggesting that concern with the “ retired husband syndrome ” should not be limited to wives , as both partners are affected , ’ they wrote .			0

experts claim women with @entity22 suffer stress , depression and *insomnia*
chances of developing syndrome increase a year after husbands retire
@entity22 affects women who worked as well as housewives
study *focused* on @entity69 , but experts say syndrome is a *global* problem
