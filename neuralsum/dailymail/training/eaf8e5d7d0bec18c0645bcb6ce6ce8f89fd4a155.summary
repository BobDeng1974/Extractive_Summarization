by @entity0 published : 17:19 est , 10 november 2012 updated : 17:19 est , 10 november 2012 he was known to millions during @entity2 as one the @entity4 voices who announced the twists and turns of the conflict in reassuringly unflappable tones			0
but it now appears the @entity11 also took a chilling interest in senior newsreader @entity13 - his details were discovered on a hand - written index card in propaganda chief dr @entity17 ’s files soon after the capture of @entity19			1
found by @entity4 war correspondent @entity21 , the card contains mr @entity13 ’s name in capital letters , followed by the annotation ‘ @entity25 ‘ , first class newsreader			1
a marked man : @entity13 would have been well known to the @entity28 because he was the first @entity4 presenter to announce his name before reading the news mr @entity13 ’s son , @entity31 , 58 , said the existence of card probably meant his father - who features in @entity4 1 ’s @entity35 on sunday evening - was ’ a marked man ’ had @entity36 successfully invaded @entity37			1
mr @entity13 ’s fluent baritone would have been well known to the @entity28 - as well as to the 16 million @entity39 who regularly listened to the @entity40 - because he became the first @entity4 presenter to announce his name before reading the news , ending a long - standing practice of anonymity			1
the change was introduced in july 1940 amid fears that @entity47 fifth - columnists could somehow infiltrate the @entity48 and put out false news broadcasts to undermine morale , a deception made far harder by genuine newsreaders identifying themselves			2
concerns that the @entity48 could be infiltrated by spies persisted right up to the final stages of the war , and secrecy was especially tight on @entity58			0
on the morning of the allied landings in @entity60 , mr @entity13 collected a highly secret script , hand - written rather than typed , from a safe in @entity62 which he was instructed to read during a special bulletin which began with his then boss @entity64 announcing the invasion			1
in the bulletin , on june 6 1944 , mr @entity64 declared : ‘ allied naval forces , supported by strong air forces , began landing @entity70 armies this morning on the northern coat of @entity60			0
’ mr @entity13 ‘ s script started : ‘ from the @entity4 in @entity37 , we are now sending an alert for the countries on the coast of @entity77 occupied by the enemy			1
@entity64 , pictured second from left with other @entity4 presenters , was mr @entity13 's boss and then the @entity4 's presentation director ‘ the people of @entity60 are being told of communique @entity83 , which you have just heard , and warned to stand by for an important broadcast from supreme headquarters allied expeditionary force			1
it continued : ‘ the important message to the peoples of the @entity92 of occupied @entity77 which will follow … will be heard by their compatriots throughout the world			0
‘ it will be carried by all services of the @entity39 broadcasting station in @entity77 and in the @entity98 by the short wave stations of the @entity100			0
’ mr @entity64 , then the @entity4 ’s presentation director who later became famous for his commentaries on the @entity102 , found the original scripts when clearing out offices in 1959			0
he sent them mr @entity13 , explaining in an accompanying letter that the scripts , which had presumably been hand written by an official in the government ’s @entity111 , could not have been dictated or typed by a secretary because they were so secret			1
mr @entity13 , who worked at the @entity4 between 1935 and 1963 , had the documents framed , including a copy of the script of the historic announcement made by mr @entity64 which had been autographed by @entity37 ’s wartime prime minister @entity118 and @entity98 military leader @entity119			2
chilling : the @entity11 seemed to have taken an interest in @entity13 as his details were discovered on a card in dr @entity124 's files mr @entity13 ’s son @entity31 , who will be seen with the scripts on the @entity35 on sunday night , said his father belonged to the era when newsreaders wore dinner jackets to read news bulletins on the radio , presumably to encourage as much formality as possible			1
he said : ‘ he became a big name			0
i can remember walking around @entity135 with him and no one recognised him until he spoke , and then people said “ i know that voice ”			0
’ his father , a former professional singer who died in 1980 , made several other historic broadcasts , including the announcement of the dropping of the atom bomb on @entity145 in @entity146 in 1945 and the assassination of @entity98 president @entity148 in 1963			0
@entity31 said he had come across about 60 touching letters written to his father after the war by people in occupied @entity77 who had said that the sound of mr @entity13 ’s voice had boosted their spirits in difficult times			2
one was from a former concentration camp prisoner and another was from a @entity157 who said the broadcasts had been so important to him that he had named his son after the newsreader			2
during the @entity35 , the expert @entity160 cites the letter from @entity162 , adding : ‘ obviously during the war , the radio was such an important part of society , both here in the @entity39 and presumably across @entity77			0
’ mr @entity167 valued the documents at about £ 2,000 , but mr @entity13 said he would never part with them .			2

@entity13 was the first presenter to announce his name on the news
his son said the card probably indicated that he was ' a marked man '
