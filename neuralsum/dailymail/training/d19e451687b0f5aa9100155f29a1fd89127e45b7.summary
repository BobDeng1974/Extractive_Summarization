by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 11:32 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 11:41 est , 23 december 2013 if you think your @entity6 schedule is hectic , then spare a thought for mother - of - nine @entity8 , from @entity9 , whose festive preparations begin in january and are planned with military precision			1
@entity8 , 39 , spends all year organising the festivities for her large brood of children , all aged between six and 16			1
to ensure she sticks to her strict budget of £ 3,000 , she starts shopping for bargain gifts in the @entity21 sales - 11 months before the big day			1
big family : @entity8 has nine children and needs a 10.6kg turkey and eight tins of @entity26 to feed them tough job : @entity28 starts preparing for @entity6 in january and needs 110m paper to wrap her gifts ' for most people @entity6 is busy but for me it 's an average day , ' explains @entity8			1
' i hear people tell me they are worried because they have nine people coming for dinner , and then it dawns on them that it 's a usual thing for me			0
' but it is brilliant fun and i love making it magical for the children , it makes me feel like i have done my job for them			0
' i think the key to running @entity6 smoothly with a big family like ours is organisation , and also realising that you are only one person and you can only do your best			2
' to ensure the day goes perfectly for @entity49 , 16 , @entity50 , 14 , @entity51 , 13 , @entity52 , 11 , @entity53 , 10 , triplets @entity54 , @entity56 , and @entity57 , aged eight and @entity58 , six , @entity8 writes her food list weeks in advance and fills two large shopping trolleys with goods worth £ 550 , including a 10.6kg turkey			1
along with the turkey she buys eight bottles of soft drink , six tins of @entity26 and dozens of boxes of biscuits			1
@entity8 's little helpers : all of the children , and husband @entity72 , pitch in and help put up the tree presents take five nights to wrap and require an astonishing 110 metres of paper , as well as piles of ribbon and bows			1
once the festive period gets underway , she and her husband @entity72 , a police sergeant , attend no fewer than six nativity plays starring their youngest five children			2
she and @entity72 then supervise the decoration of their 8ft christmas tree but because the children to help out , it takes minutes			0
on the big day itself , @entity8 less than three hours sleep as she waits until 3am to put out the children 's stockings but is woken again at 6am by the excited youngsters			1
after cramming the turkey in the oven , she and @entity72 , 53 , take their brood to church for a @entity6 service			2
they return to their six - bedroom home in @entity9 to eat dinner around the 12 seat dining table at 2pm sharp			0
the family spend the rest of the afternoon unwrapping the piles of presents and assembling toys and @entity8 finally gets a moment to herself at around midnight			2
supersized : everything about the @entity111 's @entity6 is big , including the tree - an 8ft fir @entity8 , who now works as a stress management consultant , says the experience of planning @entity6 for her large family has provided her with useful lessons to teach her clients			1
' @entity6 starts for me in january , ' she reveals			1
' i start shopping for the kids ' stockings then for things that do n't date , like stationary , underwear and socks			0
' by the time august comes around , i really start getting it in my mind and start buying their main presents			0
' but present buying does n't always go entirely to plan , so @entity8 schedules in time for returning gifts should the children change their minds ahead of the big day			2
' with new adverts on tv and new toys out all the time , what the children want can change all the time so sometimes i have to return and swap a few gifts over the year			0
' i spend about three days wrapping presents and on christmas eve i stay up until about 3am putting them in their stockings and hanging them up			0
' once they have opened their stockings we all go to church because i think that shows them what the true meaning of @entity6 is			0
' we have @entity6 dinner at about 2pm which might sound stressful but as i do a roast every sunday anyway for that many people , it 's not too bad			0
