by @entity0 whales are capable of swimming vast distances across oceans , but they are also expert divers			0
and now a study has revealed that the shy @entity7 ’s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet			2
scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal 's dives , which was 9,816ft ( 2,992 metres ) below the waves			1
a study has revealed that the shy @entity7 's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft ( 2,992metres ) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven @entity23 - and stays below for 138 minutes and the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven @entity23 on top of one another - for 138 minutes			1
the @entity29 landmark measures 1,250ft ( 381 metres ) in height , excluding its tip. it is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects			1
@entity42 mammal biologists at the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , tagged eight of the whales off @entity48 in southern @entity45 and followed them for several months as they dived for food			1
@entity52 ’s beaked whales have beached in the @entity53 and around the @entity54 and the @entity55 , @entity50 reported			2
it is thought they did this because of sonar activity from ships , but none of the species have beached in southern @entity45 – the site of a @entity65 sonar testing area – close to where the study took place , according to @entity69 , a research biologist with the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72			1
studying @entity7 ’s beaked whales is incredibly difficult as they spend a lot of their time in deep waters far away from the shore			0
it is the first time that the diving behaviour of the @entity82 ( pictured ) has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar beaked whales also rarely approach boats , according to @entity87 , a marine mammal biologist at @entity88 in @entity89 who was not involved in the study			2
some species are only known from specimens that have died and washed up on shore , dr @entity69 said in the study , which is published in the journal @entity96			0
recent research is only just giving scientists a good idea of how the whales spend their time and the experts admitted they did not expect to see any of the creatures dive almost 10,000ft ( 3,000 metres )			0
dr @entity69 was so shocked that he initially checked that the tag had not malfunctioned , by placing an identical one in a pressure chamber to check it could withstand comparable depths			0
dr @entity87 described the deepest dive as ‘ spectacular ’ and hypothesised that such efforts must be worth it for the animals to keep on diving			0
@entity52 's beaked whales have beached in the @entity53 and around the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
it is thought they did this because of sonar activity from ships ( pictured ) , but none of the species have beached in southern @entity45 - the site of a @entity65 sonar testing area - close to where the study took place he presumes they are rewarded by finding food such as deep - sea squid , but diving so deep can cause lungs to collapse and can even trigger convulsions			1
it is thought that @entity7 ’s beaked whales get around these problems because they have rib cages that can fold down so there is less air in the lungs			0
but scientists are unsure how they manage to avoid high - pressure nervous syndrome , which causes convulsions			0
the team of experts hope that their research might help solve this mystery in years to come but are currently focused on whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar			1
studying @entity7 's beaked whales ( illustrated ) is incredibly difficult as they spend a lot of their time in deep waters far away from the shore			2

one @entity52 's beaked whale dived 9,816ft ( 2,992 metres ) below the waves and stayed below for 38 minutes
the equivalent of 6.75 @entity159 placed on top of one another
biologists at @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 tagged eight of the whales off @entity48 in southern @entity45
they are interested in whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar *emitted* from ships
