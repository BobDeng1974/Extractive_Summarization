@entity2 ’s @entity1 spacecraft , which has been in orbit around @entity4 since 30 june 2004 , has returned stunning new images of the gas giant and its various moons			1
close - up views of @entity4 ’s clouds , an amazing sunrise as well as several of its moons are revealed in unprecedented detail			2
the pictures were released by the @entity14 ( @entity15 )			0
@entity2 ’s @entity1 spacecraft has returned stunning new images of @entity4 and its moons			1
here the planet is seen circled by its rings nearly edge - on			0
the object lower right is the @entity22 , while @entity23 is a bit further up at the 4 o'clock position if you follow the rings in one stunning image @entity4 is seen lit up by the sun with its rings nearly edge - on			1
the shadow of the rings is also clearly seen near the south pole of the gas giant			1
another image showcases a close - up of @entity4 ’s north pole , showing swirling clouds making their way around the planet			2
and elsewhere , a new day on the planet is seen dawning as it emerges into light			0
the planet rotates in 10 hours and 40 minutes , meaning its days and nights are much shorter than on @entity44			0
equally remarkable are the colour mosaics of various moons released by the @entity48 global mosaics were produced using images taken by the @entity1 in its first ten years exploring the @entity4 system			1
this view is looking towards the sunlit side of @entity4 ’s rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane			2
it too was taken at a distance of 1.1 million miles ( 1.8 million km ) , with the scale in the image being 67 miles ( 108km ) per pixel the fascinating moon @entity60 is seen in the background at the top right here , partially lit by the sun as small particles high in its atmosphere scatter the light of the distant sun. in the foreground is @entity4 from a distance of 1.1 million miles ( 1.8 million km ) this image shows the cloud dynamics on @entity4 , which astronomers study to better understand fluid flows			1
this is useful for studying our own atmosphere , and possibly that of other planetary bodies as well			0
this view was taken from a distance of 1.1 million miles ( 1.8 million km ) launch : 15 october 1997 from @entity83 , @entity84 dimensions : 22 feet ( 6.7 metres ) high ; 13.1 feet ( 4 meters ) wide total weight : 5,712 kilograms ( 12,593 pounds ) with fuel , @entity89 probe , adapter , etc orbiter weight ( unfueled ) : 2,125 kilograms ( 4,685 pounds ) power : 885 watts ( 633 watts at end of mission ) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators @entity96 traveled to reach @entity4 : 2.2 billion miles ( 3.5 billion kilometres ) key instruments : imaging radar , cosmic dust analyser , infrared mapping spectrometer earlier this year , @entity1 celebrated its tenth year in orbit around @entity4 - the first and only spacecraft to circle the planet			1
since then it has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries , including lakes on the @entity60 and giant storms on @entity4			1
the mission is jointly run by @entity2 , @entity110 and the @entity111 ( @entity111 )			0
its total cost is about £ 1.9 billion ( $ 3.26 billion ) , of which the @entity114 supplied 80 per cent , @entity116 15 per cent and @entity117 5 per cent			0
it was launched on 18 october 1997 and , during its seven - year trip to @entity4 , it flew by @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity123			0
the highlight of its initial year at @entity4 was arguably the release of the @entity89 probe onto the surface of @entity60			2
on christmas day 2004 this probe , 4.3 ft ( 1.3 metres ) across , was released and , on 14 january 2005 , it entered the atmosphere of @entity4 ’s largest moon @entity60			1
that same day it became the first spacecraft ever to touch down on a body in the outer solar system and , in the process , spotted surface features that indicated the presence of liquids			0
since then @entity60 has been studied in depth by @entity1 , and in so doing it has revealed lakes and seas on its surface , in addition to its thick atmosphere			1
it has also studied in depth many of @entity4 ’s dozens of other moons			2
here we see a global , colour mosaic of @entity4 ’s icy moon @entity151			2
the yellow and magenta tones show the difference in thickness of surface deposits			0
the moon is covered in ice and might harbour a liquid ocean underground this image shows the amazing world of @entity163 with a resolution of 400 metres per pixel			0
@entity163 is fascinating as it has a bizarre ‘ two - tone ’ colouration , in addition to a giant crater and a giant equatorial ridge that runs three quarters of the way around the moon @entity1 has sent back hundreds of gigabytes of scientific data , enabling the publication of more than 3,000 scientific reports			0
the mission will come to a conclusion in 2017 , when the spacecraft will no longer have enough fuel to maintain its orbit around @entity4			2
to prevent it accidentally crashing on and contaminating one of the moons , @entity2 will send the spacecraft diving into the atmosphere of @entity4			1
in the process the spacecraft will be crushed and destroyed , but not before it returns fascinating information about the gas giant ’s cloud tops			1
this last task will also mark the end of an era ; currently there is no future spacecraft planned to visit @entity4			0
with interest instead focusing on @entity198 , @entity123 and other moons like @entity200 , it may be some time before @entity4 gets another mission of its own			0
some areas of the scientific community , though , are hoping form a mission to @entity60			0
and they may just get their wish if , before its plunge into @entity4 ’s atmosphere , @entity1 spots something on the surface that piques the interest of the whole world			1
the @entity1 ( illustration shown ) has been in orbit around @entity4 since 30 june 2004			1
in 2017 , when it runs out of fuel , it will be sent on a daring dive into the atmosphere of @entity4 to gather data about the planet 's atmosphere			2

@entity2 scientists in @entity222 have revealed stunning images of @entity4 and its various moons
the pictures were taken by the @entity1 spacecraft , in orbit around the gas giant since 30 june 2004
in the images the planet is seen lit up by the sun with the shadow of its rings cast across it
others show various moons in orbit around @entity4 , such as @entity60 with its thick atmosphere
and the @entity1 team has also produced the most detailed mosaic maps of some of @entity4 's moons
