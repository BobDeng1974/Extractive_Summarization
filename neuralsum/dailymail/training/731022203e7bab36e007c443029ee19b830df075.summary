swan song : all mute swans could be culled in @entity2 under proposals being considered @entity2 has hatched a plan to rid the stat of the entire swan population , amid claims the birds have been responsible for attacking people , destroying vegetation and polluting the water with their feces			1
draft proposals suggest killing or resettling @entity2 's 2,200 wild mute swans by 2025			1
there are also fears that swans pose a threat to aircraft , much like the flock of geese that collided with a @entity22 flight in 2009 , causing it to crash on the @entity24			1
since then the @entity26 @entity25 has carried out an annual cull on @entity29 geese and wants to extend this to include swans			0
opposition group @entity32 called the proposals ' outrageous ' and said a 2,200 - strong population of swans could not really pose a threat to a state where more than 18 million people live			1
watch founder @entity39 told @entity40 : ' it 's just outrageous to try to exterminate an entire species that has been living in the state for more than 150 years , almost 200 years			2
' he added : ' i 've yet to find anyone who has been seriously injured by a mute swan			0
' when they 're being aggressive it 's often in relation to them protecting their nest , their babies			0
' i mean people need to have some common sense			2

some conservationists believe culling in @entity71 is absolutely necessary			0
@entity90 , associate professor of natural resources at @entity92 , said : ' the goal is to limit population growth in the wild , and remove swans from places where they cause problems or do damage to plant communities			0
' meanwhile the state conservation department stands by the proposals , stating that the proposal to resettle the swans makes it ' balanced and comprehensive '			0
' outrageous ' : critics are angry over plans to cull swans , which have been living wild in places like @entity111 , @entity2 , for almost 150 years			1
