the judge who allowed the naming of a teenager who killed his teacher yesterday hit back at his critics and insisted that public shaming had a ‘ clear deterrent effect			1
’ mr @entity7 took a swipe at ‘ ill - informed commentators ’ as he explained why he agreed to a media application to allow 16 - year - old @entity11 to be identified			1
the judge dismissed defence claims @entity11 should be protected under @entity15 human rights laws			0
jailed : classroom murderer @entity11 , 16 , left , was allowed to be named after he was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in jail for the murder of his teacher @entity19 , 61 , right , in front of her class @entity11 was told he must serve a minimum of 20 years for murdering teacher @entity19 , 61 , in front of her class and warned him he might never be released because he is so dangerous			2
during a discussion on the @entity27 ’s @entity26 programme on tuesday critics argued that @entity11 ’s name should have been kept secret because he will be put at risk and it will hinder his rehabilitation			2
they said no useful purpose was served by naming the killer – and said the killers of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity36 , also should not have been named			0
in his written judgement mr @entity7 said he came down ‘ firmly on the side of the public interest			1
’ ' naming him has a clear deterrent effect ' : mr @entity7 said identifying @entity11 as the killer would also inform the public debate about the issues he said : ‘ in my view , naming him has a clear deterrent effect			1
ill - informed commentators may scoff , but those of us involved in the criminal justice system know that deterrence will almost always be a factor in the naming of those involved in offences such as this			1
’ the judge added : ‘ it has to be noted that this is an exceptional case			0
public interest has been huge			1
there are wider issues at stake , such as the safety of teachers , the possibility of @entity68 - style security measures in schools , and the dangers of “ internet loners ” concocting violent fantasies on the internet			0
‘ i consider that the debate on those issues will be informed by the identification of @entity76 as the killer			2
‘ that is not least because he can not be dismissed as the product of a hopeless background or a dysfunctional family			0
‘ on the contrary , for the reasons already given , he came from a loving and supportive family who have been devastated by what he did			0
’ @entity86 , a barrister representing media organisations including the @entity88 , had argued criminals who commit ‘ serious and detestable ’ offences should be publicly identified			0
@entity11 ’s barrister @entity91 , @entity92 , told @entity93 naming @entity11 would be ‘ wholly contrary ’ to his welfare			1
mr @entity91 said there was a real and immediate danger @entity11 would either kill himself or be attacked by other inmates if his identity was known			2
he argued it would make any prospect of his rehabilitation ‘ effectively impossible			0
’ fears for the killer ’s family was also given as a reason for secrecy , but the judge said @entity11 ’s supportive parents will continue to help their son ‘ whether he is identified or not ’ on @entity26 the decision was criticised by a convicted juvenile murderer			1
@entity113 , who served 32 years in prison for murdering a friend , said : ‘ i do n’t see how it ’s of any use , it serves no useful purpose , to put his name and picture in the paper			0
’ @entity113 was 14 when he pleaded guilty to clubbing an 11 - year - old friend to death on a bus with the leg of a school desk			0
author @entity129 , compared the case to that of @entity36 ’s killers @entity37 and @entity36 , about whom he has written extensively			0
he said : ‘ by naming the boy he will be exposed to dangers from other prisoners and of course his family , who are blameless in this , will also be in the public eye			2
‘ so i honestly do n’t see what public interest is being served here by people knowing who this boy is			1
’ @entity146 , of the @entity147 wrote in the @entity148 : ‘ any judge who claims that it is in the public interest to identify a 16 - year - old boy convicted of murder – as happened today to the killer of schoolteacher @entity19 – risks giving in to the voracious media and to public voyeurism			1

mr @entity7 takes a swipe at ‘ ill - informed commentators ’
he said there was ' huge ' public interest in naming @entity19 *'s* killer
critics said he was giving into ' voyeurism ' and putting @entity11 at risk
