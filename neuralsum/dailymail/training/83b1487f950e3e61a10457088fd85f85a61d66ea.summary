@entity0 , a doctor and a presumed @entity15 presidential contender , made his comments during a stop at @entity17 in @entity18			1
in his remarks , he suggested @entity3 could spread at a cocktail party attended by someone who is symptomatic , according to @entity23 video footage			1
the likely 2016 @entity15 presidential candidate was in the nation 's first presidential primary state yesterday to rally voters ahead of november 's midterm elections @entity0 walks through a crowd of young @entity15 at the state @entity15 headquarters			2
while @entity0 was speaking before a group of college students yesterday , he intimated that the @entity7 is lying about easily @entity3 can spread @entity0 has made similar comments in the wake of the first diagnosis of @entity3 in the @entity42 earlier this month			1
the @entity44 senator told a conservative radio show host that ' we should not underestimate the transmissibility ' of the virus and warned that society may not be ' making sound , rational , scientific decisions ' about @entity3 ' because of political correctness			1
' ' it 's a big mistake to downplay and act as if " oh , this is not a big deal , we can control all this			0
" this could get beyond our control , ' @entity0 , who has an md in optometry from @entity59 , told @entity62			2
' my suspicion is that it 's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it			0
' since @entity0 first lobbed the accusations at the government , two more people within the @entity42 have come down with @entity3			1
on wednesday @entity0 said the @entity73 makes the transmission of @entity3 sound similar to that of @entity76			1
@entity3 , he says , is easier to contract			1
' you 're not going to get @entity76 at a cocktail party			2
no one 's going to cough on you and you 're going to get @entity76			2
that 's what they make it sound exactly like , ' @entity0 said			1
' but then you listen to them closely , they say you have to have direct contact			0
but you know how they define direct contact ? being within three feet of someone			0
' the @entity44 senator made phone calls to rally voters at the state @entity15 party headquarters likewise in the epidemic zone in @entity103 , people involved with burials of highly infectious bodies are at high risk			0
' should you be worried you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone ? ' dr. @entity105 , director of the @entity73 , said wednesday			2
' the answer to that is no. ' still , @entity0 's team pointed to the @entity73 's website that says being within three feet of an infected patient for a prolonged period of time without the proper gear is a ' low - risk exposure ' for @entity3			1
' i think from the very beginning they have n't been completely forthright with us , ' @entity0 told @entity122 on thursday			0
' they have so wanted to downplay this that they really , i do n't think , have been very accurate in their description of the disease			0

it also asserted that a ban on travel from @entity103 would make it difficult to send cargo critical to stopping the spread of @entity3 to the region , as commercial airlines would most likely be unwilling to come back empty handed			2
