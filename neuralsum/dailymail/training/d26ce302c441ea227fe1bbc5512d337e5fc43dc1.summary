a @entity1 student who sold her virginity for £ 485,000 is yet again offering it up in another online auction , claiming she the original deal was never consummated			1
@entity6 , 21 , is selling her ' virginity ' to bidders for the minimum of £ 62,000 , but says she hopes for at least £ 930,000 ( $ 1.5million )			1
miss @entity6 's original ' virginity auction ' was filmed for an @entity11 documentary , but she claims she was duped by filmmaker @entity12 , and that she was never given the money a @entity15 man paid for her purity last october			1
' after being featured by so many media outlets in so many countries , i decided to actually auction off my virginity , ' she explains to @entity31 regarding her decision to yet again sell her virginity			0
miss @entity6 previously said she wanted to give 90 per cent of the final auction sale price to a non-governmental organization constructing modern houses in her southern home state of @entity37			2
however , as she claims never to have been given the money - nor lost her virginity - the organisation has yet to receive her help			1
in october last year , @entity41 , 53 , a @entity15 millioniaire fended off strong competition from @entity46 bidders @entity44 and @entity47 , and @entity50 big - spender @entity48 , to secure a date with the physical education student - who said she would use the cash to build homes for poverty - stricken families			0
tricked ? the physical education student claims she has not received the money promised to her by filmmaker @entity12 , and believes the auction was simply a publicity stunt for @entity11 documentary , virgins wanted the auction was supposedly part of an @entity11 documentary entitled @entity65 , in which mr @entity66 would explore the lives of @entity68 and @entity69 , a male who auctioned his virginity for $ 3,000			1
but when miss @entity6 went to meet her winning bidder , @entity74 , in a @entity76 restaurant , she claims that he did n't match the description mr @entity12 had given her , and insists the pair did not have sex			2
she also claims mr @entity12 did not cover her traveling expenses , or give her the £ 485,000paid by @entity74 ; and she now believes that ' @entity74 ' does n't exist , and that the auction was simply a ploy to gain media coverage for the documentary			1
' i agreed to go along with [ the auction ] , because @entity12 said it would be the best way to draw attention from the media about the project , ' she said			0
mr @entity12 , who first announced the documentary in may 2010 and said it would conclude with both of the virgins having sex , denies her claims			0
' we have the footage to prove otherwise , ' he explained			0
in a bid to avoid prostitution laws , miss @entity6 was to be ' delivered ' to her buyer on board a plane between @entity11 and the @entity46 - being interviewed before and after the sexual act			2
the intercourse itself would not be filmed , said mr @entity12 , and @entity74 would retain a right to be anonymous , without his picture appearing in the media			0
both @entity6 's original claims of virginity and this time around have been treated with suspicion by medical professionals as it there is no foolproof way of telling if a woman is a virgin			2
miss @entity6 signed up to the project three years ago when she saw an advert by @entity114 looking for a virgin to film .			0
