@entity0 is so respected and so clearly a deeply intelligent man that every now and then you find yourself nodding sagely at something he has said which , upon closer examination , turns out to sound right but to have decidedly unsubstantial foundations			1
usually it is related to how @entity7 ’s defensive record is statistically actually very good ( it is ) in the aftermath of the latest debacle			1
but last week it was on the issue of quotas , or more specifically @entity15 chairman @entity14 ’s idea of increasing the number of homegrown players in a @entity19 squad of 25 from eight to 12			1
‘ i believe that we are in the world of competition , ’ said @entity0 in one of his regular interviews to @entity22			1
‘ that means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best or we are not in a competition anymore			0
@entity7 manager @entity0 shows his frustrations during a @entity19 match in march 2011 @entity15 chairman @entity14 pictured attending the friendly between @entity32 and @entity33 in @entity34 on tuesday ‘ so we can say one or two things – we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players			1
if you want to sell the @entity19 for a huge amount of money then we need to say : " buy this , this is the best league in the world			2
" you can not go against the quality and what is at the heart of our job , which is competition			0
’ and on the surface there seems nothing wrong with this			0
as an economics graduate @entity0 is a disciple of @entity50 and these are the basic principles of a free market			2
tear down barriers , let competition flourish and the best man or woman will ultimately win – or at least have a place in @entity0 ’s starting @entity58 it sounds sensible enough but of course the issue is a little more complex than @entity0 implies			2
a cursory glance at @entity0 ’s transfer record shows in his bid to save the @entity19 from @entity66 mediocrity he has signed @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
@entity7 's @entity71 on the ball during a league match against @entity82 at @entity83 in 2011 @entity74 ( left ) attempts to control the ball during a @entity86 clash with @entity87 in 2012 @entity7 midfielder @entity77 ( left ) holds off @entity89 's @entity88 at the @entity90 in 2011 there are more but that ’s what a brief search elicits			2
you might argue that you need to sign ten park chu - youngs to get one @entity97			0
and of course , over 18 years any manager , even a great one as @entity0 is , can make some dud buys			1
he made some very good ones from abroad as well : @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 ... we could go on			0
but the list of shame does expose a flaw at the heart of his argument			0
clubs always argue for fewer restrictions and they always say it is to do with excellence			0
the reality is it ’s just as much to do with cost			0
there is nothing in @entity14 ’s proposals to stop @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 playing for @entity7			1
it might however make it a little trickier for the likes of @entity78 , @entity71 and @entity68 in the future			0
the reason why @entity7 went for @entity68 back in 2000 was not because it he was excellent ; it was because he was cheaper than the equivalent @entity66 player ; same with @entity78 in 2004 and @entity71 in 2011			2
turns out they were n’t good enough either			0
@entity7 's @entity73 in action during a @entity86 match against @entity133 in 2011 @entity68 ( left ) battles with @entity136 's @entity135 for the ball at @entity138 in december 2000 @entity7 goalkeeper @entity78 watches a shot go wide at the @entity90 in january 2011 now it may be that applying more quotas could be detrimental to @entity14 ’s vision of encouraging clubs to play @entity66 players in that it pushes their price up even more			1
that ’s a debate worth having but the main thrust of @entity14 ’s proposals is simply to encourage the clubs to rely less on the marketplace and grow their own players			1
for @entity0 ’s argument sounds great in theory but the reality is that there is a class of players at the tip of the footballers ’ pyramid which stand out and which any team would want – the @entity160 , @entity165 of this world			1
nothing in @entity14 ’s rules to prevent them from signing , as they were @entity171 nationals			2
you would only have to be a little more sure you could find space for them as one of your 13 – that ’s 13 ! – foreign players in your squad of 25			1
but there is another tier of players below that – let ’s says the @entity185 and @entity186 level ( who would also still be available under they @entity14 proposals as @entity171 players )			1
these are good players , but they are much more plentiful than the elite			0
in fact , given the right training and a chance in the first team , you could probably produce your own			0
@entity7 did once : @entity197			2
served @entity0 quite well , too , in his double - winning and invincible years			2
@entity197 falls to the ground after a tackle by @entity200 's @entity199 at @entity201 in 2004 @entity0 ( left ) watches on from the touchline as @entity7 face @entity203 in the @entity204 last month but @entity197 was developed before @entity0 arrived and he was the beneficiary of a youth system which was thriving at the time			1
the @entity7 manager , since his arrival , has never shown an awful amount of interest in @entity7 ’s youth set - up			1
he is undoubtedly a manager who supports young players – it ’s just most of them are signed from abroad or @entity215 rather than coming from his own academy			2
the fact that @entity218 and @entity219 are regular starters and were players developed at @entity7 's academy during @entity0 ’s 18 years is exceptional for his period as manager			1
@entity225 was his greatest find from that source but who knows what would have happened to him had @entity230 not had to leave the club suddenly when his @entity233 nationality was called into question ? all @entity14 is trying to do is focus clubs and their managers on trying a little bit harder to look in their own backyard before spending £ 2million on @entity75			2
nothing he has proposed would stop @entity19 clubs from signing genuine superstars			0
the ‘ best league in the world ’ ( the league , incidentally , without any qualifiers in the @entity204 quarter - finals under the current policy ) is under no threat whatsoever			0
@entity7 's @entity218 ( left ) breaks past @entity250 's @entity249 at @entity251 last month @entity7 's @entity219 ( front ) charges forward with the ball during a friendly against @entity255 on tuesday sadly @entity14 probably killed his idea by announcing it in public before asking the clubs			1
if there is one thing guaranteed to rile the @entity19 , it ’s attempting to dictate terms			0
the only way to cajole the multi-national group of owners and executives into helping @entity66 football is by convincing them it ’s in their own interests			0
most are already on board in theory with the narrative that homegrown players are worthwhile			1
but now they need an additional nudge to take the final step and actually play some of their expensively - trained academy players			0
even @entity279 , who has a great track record with @entity66 players , would n’t have given @entity282 a go if @entity284 and @entity285 had been producing			0
but if @entity282 is n’t a good enough incentive for the @entity19 clubs to work harder to promote players , perhaps their recent travails in the @entity204 and @entity288 might convince them			1
a majority of the best players in the world are being produced in @entity295 and @entity296 ; another significant proportion come from @entity298			0
@entity200 's @entity285 gestures during the @entity86 semi-final in january @entity200 star @entity282 celebrates after scoring against @entity300 at @entity201 last month the best of those players will naturally aspire to play for @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305			0
now that @entity309 restrictions mean the wages are no bigger over here , those that come to the @entity19 will be the second tier of stars that ca n’t make it at those clubs			0
if @entity66 clubs want to be the best in the world , they ’re going to have to become an awful lot better at creating the best players			0
and if @entity0 wants to examine something truly mediocre he might wish to cast his eye over the @entity19 ’s record in @entity325 over the past three seasons			1
in fact , if he paid a little more attention to building a core of homegrown players then perhaps , like @entity330 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity303 and @entity305 , @entity7 might have won the @entity204 by now .			1

@entity15 chairman @entity14 wants to increase the *minimum* homegrown players in a @entity19 squad of 25 from eight to 12
@entity7 manager @entity0 has criticised the proposal
@entity0 has had his fair share of dud buys for the @entity342
perhaps he should pay attention to building a core of homegrown players
