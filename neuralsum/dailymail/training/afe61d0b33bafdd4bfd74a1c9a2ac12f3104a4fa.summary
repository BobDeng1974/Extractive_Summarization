@entity0 has former @entity2 team - mate @entity1 to thank for his first league victory in @entity5 football			1
the @entity7 boss spoke to gerrard about 21 - year - old @entity9 playmaker @entity8 last week and the @entity10 duly headed south on a season - long loan deal			1
@entity8 – signed from @entity12 for £ 830,000 in 2012 – made his first start at @entity14 last night and was on target as he inspired @entity0 ’s pointless side to a much - needed win			1
jumping for joy : @entity8 celebrates after giving @entity7 the lead against @entity20 at @entity14 @entity20 : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 ( @entity30 , 81 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 , 80 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 , 45 )			1
subs not used : @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39			0

@entity7 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity47 ( @entity46 , 59 ) , @entity48 , @entity50 ( @entity49 , 75 ) , @entity8 ( @entity51 , 90 ) , @entity33			1
subs not used : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56			0
scorer : @entity8 , 5 , @entity46 , 84			1
referee : @entity59 ( @entity60 ) the @entity62 defender was already under pressure having opened the season with back - to - back 1 - 0 losses against @entity66 and @entity67			1
a conversation with @entity1 , however , helped change that and , on this evidence , @entity8 could well have a first - team future at @entity72 when he returns next summer			1
and @entity0 said : ‘ @entity8 is still young and can improve and hopefully we are the stepping stone to the first eleven at @entity2			1
he showed tonight he can really play football			0
‘ i ’m grateful that @entity2 let him come here and hopefully it works both ways – we ’ve got a quality player on our hands and we hope he can play many games - that would also suit @entity2			2
‘ he would not have got much time on the pitch ( at @entity2 )			0
he needs to play games to improve			0
i ’m very happy to have him here			0
’ the game was only five minutes old when livewire @entity8 broke the deadlock , @entity90 springing him clear and he defied a narrow angle to slide across @entity21 and into the bottom corner			1
at the double : @entity94 ( centre ) celebrates after doubling the @entity97 advantage aerial duel : leeds left back @entity25 gets the better of @entity7 defender @entity41 in the air the @entity102 under - 21 youngster was at the heart of everything good about his side during the early exchanges and , after wriggling free of two white shirts inside the area , he teed up @entity109 only for his shot to cannon into a defender			1
the @entity97 should have doubled their advantage before the break but the unmarked @entity41 headed over at the far post having been located by @entity44 ’s left - wing delivery			2
that chance – effortlessly fashioned by @entity7 – drew boos from a frustrated home crowd			2
but @entity20 should have been level after the break when the energetic @entity22 - a reported target of @entity2 - broke clear down the right and drew back to @entity31 , lurking on the penalty spot			1
the former @entity125 man had the whole goal to aim at but fired straight at the sliding @entity41 , much to the angst of the @entity14 fans			0
that allowed substitute @entity94 to make sure of @entity0 ’s first points of the season when he smashed home a late free - kick			1
and @entity0 - appointed in june having been sacked by @entity134 in april – reflected : ‘ we showed what we can do , especially in the first half			1
‘ but we had to dig in and keep our concentration on the defensive side			0
i was very happy that we kept a clean sheet			0
‘ if you want to play football you need good footballers on the field			0
i was a defender so i do n’t know if it ’s strange i want to play this way , but that ’s what i like			0
‘ i think we can take a lot of confidence from this performance and i hope we can play our way out of the @entity153			2
i think the players will enjoy playing this way			0
’ meanwhile , @entity20 manager @entity155 said : ‘ i ca n’t tell you how disappointed i was with the first half			2
we did n’t work together and we gave the ball away cheaply			2
‘ we gave it a go in the second half but lacked a cutting edge			0
’ challenge : @entity163 frontman @entity109 attempts to get the better of @entity20 new boy @entity24			2

@entity7 *achieve* first @entity153 win of the season with 2 - 0 victory against @entity20
@entity0 enjoys first league victory as @entity7 boss
@entity8 gave @entity7 the lead after five minutes
