by @entity0 it was more than the cheering of the crowd and the hand - banging on the hoardings that powered @entity5 to the time - trial gold medal on thursday			1
the 25 - year - old @entity7 carried with him the extra incentive of banishing the heartache of the past few months - and the worrying of a lifetime - in coming from six seconds down to @entity11 ’s @entity10 at the start of the final section to win by nearly 10 seconds			1
minutes after being given his gold medal , he was holding it in his hands , contemplating his biggest achievement more in relief than joy			1
champion : @entity7 's @entity5 clinched gold in the @entity23 cycling time trial @entity24 : @entity5 completed the @entity26 course in 47 minutes , 41.78 seconds prize : @entity5 poses with his gold medal after his brilliant victory in the time trial the most recent impetus to his winning here in @entity26 was provided by his exclusion through illness from the @entity33 for this year ’s @entity34 , which took in his home county of @entity37 on its way from @entity39 to the @entity40			1
it was agony for him			2
a son of racing driver @entity44 , he took himself off to the @entity46 @entity45 at @entity47 to escape his pain			0
he does not blame @entity33 ’s management for leaving him out , for he was coughing up ‘ rainbow - coloured ’ phlegm			1
but he added : ‘ i was angry for pretty much the whole month			0
i was an a * * * to live with			0
i took it out on everyone , especially my family - they bore the brunt of it			2
’ but the @entity34 setback was hardly the start of the @entity59 ’ suffering since he took up cycling because , as he is a haemophiliac , it was marginally safer for him than contact sports			1
‘ there have been a lot of disappointments over the years , ’ said @entity5 , a three - time @entity46 champion			1
‘ for example , i broke my elbow and got close to @entity68 in the operation to fix it			0
before the @entity72 at the end of last year i was going really well , when i picked up a little bug			0
podium : @entity5 ( centre ) with silver medallist @entity10 ( left ) and bronze medallist @entity77 ( right ) one better : @entity5 improved on his silver medal from four years ago at the @entity80 2010 games ‘ i was down by about 30 per cent power , and @entity82 ( the world champion ) beat me by six minutes , which was n’t easy			1
i got in the bus after that and burst into tears			0
it ’s nice that things have gone right for this one			0
’ @entity5 will take part in the road race on sunday , but the medal that was his no 1 priority is already his			1
@entity10 was second , @entity77 of @entity94 third			1
the defending champion @entity95 , of @entity96 , was eighth			1
‘ i am the sort of person who questions everything , ’ @entity5 added			1
‘ if my numbers are not right in a session , i get worried			0
i worry all the time			2
i can hopefully worry a bit less from now on			0
’ sights : @entity5 passes by @entity104 on his way to @entity23 glory in the women ’s race @entity107 took her leave of professional time - trialling with a silver medal			1
even some old boys from the hard pubs on the city ’s @entity115 came out with their morning pints to watch the spectacle			0
@entity107 was the penultimate rider , setting the fastest time by more than 48 seconds , but was denied victory by @entity120 of @entity121 , the partner of @entity123 ’s elder sister @entity122			1
@entity107 , 31 , will retire after sunday ’s road race , in which she is expected to support @entity125			2
she has already turned to the more lucrative pursuit of marathons and triathlons with some success and that is where her future lies			0
looking back on a career that included an @entity134 silver medal in 2008 and the world title in 2010 , @entity107 said : ‘ i ’m absolutely delighted to have had a surprising opportunity			1
i never expected to be a professional cyclist			0
you start off with friends who give you lifts to races and who help you sort out your bike			2
‘ then you move on to a team where everybody is a volunteer			2
so many people have helped me			0
i ’m immensely grateful to all of them			0
i have made some great friends along the way			0
it has been a huge privilege			0
’ she had problems with her bike before the race that meant she would have had the use of just one gear but for the team ’s mechanics working hard on the repairs			2
@entity107 left with no regrets			2
‘ i did myself justice so i am happy , ’ she said			0
