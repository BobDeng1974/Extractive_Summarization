@entity0 are refusing to rule out the possibilty of a re-vote on the locations of the 2018 and 2022 @entity4 or that @entity5 and / or @entity6 could be stripped of the tournaments			1
@entity0 president @entity8 has stated unequivocally that @entity5 and @entity6 will stage the events and ethics judge @entity10 has ruled that a corruption probe found nothing that to undermine the ‘ integrity ’ of the votes , which were four years ago this week			1
but well - placed sources have told @entity16 that the integrity of the 14 - 8 vote in favour of @entity6 for 2022 in particular is ‘ clouded in doubt at the least ’ because of two ongoing investigations involving voting members of @entity0 ’s @entity23 ( @entity24 )			1
@entity0 president @entity8 reveals @entity6 as the host for the @entity6 back in 2010 as the @entity28 revealed last week , five @entity0 officials face criminal investgation in @entity30 arising from bid business and several are believed to be @entity33 voters			2

as few as three invalidated votes for @entity6 for 2022 would potentially be enough to have changed the outcome in the @entity49 ’s favour and one source believes voters contributing six or more @entity6 votes are among those being probed			2
@entity34 is investigating three @entity0 executive committee members following @entity6 probe @entity8 insists no re-vote will take place for 2018 and 2022 @entity4 but @entity0 refused to rule it out when the @entity16 asked @entity0 to clarify whether @entity5 and @entity6 would keep the events regardless of the investigations , a spokeswoman said only : ‘ the 2018 @entity62 was awarded to @entity5 and the @entity6 to @entity6			1
@entity0 does not comment on speculation			0

*controversy* *surrounds* @entity6 2018 in @entity5 and 2022 in @entity6
@entity0 president @entity8 has stated the venues will not be changed
but well - placed sources have told @entity16 that the integrity of the 14 - 8 vote in favour of @entity6 in particular is ' clouded in doubt '
re-vote for both 2018 and 2022 tournaments is not ruled out by @entity0 if corruption into the *original* process is found during investigation
