@entity0 lauded @entity2 's contribution as @entity3 beat @entity4 on saturday to consolidate their place at the top of the @entity7			1
the @entity8 forward struck a sublime free - kick after six minutes to put @entity3 on their way to a seventh win from eight games this season in a feisty 2 - 1 @entity15 derby victory at @entity16			1
@entity2 's fine form last season and his selfless displays convinced @entity0 to play him ahead of @entity21 , who left for @entity22 in january			1
@entity2 has impressed for @entity3 this season , particularly against @entity23 and @entity4 the 23 - year - old 's form tailed off as @entity3 's title challenge faltered , while it was suggested he was preserving himself for the summer 's @entity28 finals in @entity8			1
@entity0 does not regard @entity2 as simply a playmaker , as the @entity30 continues to flourish			1
' @entity2 , in this moment , is not a number 10 , ' the @entity32 boss said			1
' he had an evolution , a mental , tactical evolution that allows him to be a fantastic player			1
' can he physically improve ? of course			2
people forget that he is still so young			2
' @entity0 was full of praise for the @entity30 , saying he has evolved into a fantastic player when @entity42 , who scored @entity3 's second , was the subject of close attention against @entity4 , it was @entity2 who dropped deep to fill the @entity48 's role			1
@entity0 added : ' he 's not a number 10 that plays with the ball at his feet , he 's a number 10 that looks back , looks to the side , analyses the game and sees where the team needs him to move to get the ball and also to create balance			2
' in the first half when they had ( @entity62 ) @entity61 playing man to man with @entity42 , i was so happy with that			0
' @entity42 was taking @entity61 from the central area and @entity2 was dropping back to play			2
@entity67 dives in vain as @entity2 puts @entity3 ahead against @entity4 at @entity16 ' and @entity2 and ( @entity70 ) @entity69 controlled the game completely for us			1
' @entity4 responded with a late @entity74 goal , which proved merely a consolation , but was set up by @entity76 , who helped the @entity4 to promotion in 2013 after signing for @entity22			2
@entity78 has had limited opportunities to impress back on loan at @entity16 , with @entity4 boss @entity81 determined for the winger to improve his decision making			1
@entity81 said : ' @entity76 has been working very hard with me for the past 10 days			0
' he knows what i think about him and what i am going to do with him			0
he 's clear about that			0
@entity81 said @entity76 has been working hard to improves his discipline since rejoining the club ' his discipline is a lot better			0
he 's learning when to do his tricks and when not to do his tricks			0
' if he gets the ball in the right area , he 's as good as anybody			0
' he has gone to a massive club early on in his career where you do n't get a lot of coaching			0
i think that 's what he needs			0
' his attitude has been super for me			0
