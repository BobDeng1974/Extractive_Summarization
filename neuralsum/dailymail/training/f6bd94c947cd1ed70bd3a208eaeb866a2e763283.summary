@entity0 took a stranglehold on the second test against @entity3 as they opened up a lead of 370 runs at the end of the third day 's play on saturday			1
they dismissed @entity3 for 261 runs to take a first - innings lead of 309			1
captain @entity12 could have enforced a follow - on , but opted to bat again and set an even bigger target for the opposition			2
in the second innings , @entity0 reached 61 - 2 , losing the two openers in the 21 overs possible before stumps			1
@entity0 batsman @entity21 ( centre ) plays a shot during the second test against @entity3 more frustratingly for @entity3 , @entity24 , who has now made centuries in each of the three innings of the series , was still out there on 16 , with @entity29 giving him company on 21 after fast bowler @entity31 removed the opening batsmen quickly			1
@entity0 batting coach @entity33 defended @entity12 's decision not to enforce the follow - on			1
' i was n't surprised by the decision , some of our bowlers were tired , ' @entity33 said			0
' i think @entity12 wanted to make sure there was only one winner in the match by batting again			0
we will bat till lunch and then try to bowl them out			0
' @entity3 's fate was more or less sealed by their inept batting display			2
the pitch at @entity52 still played fair but the @entity53 showed a distinct lack of application as wickets kept falling at regular intervals			0
@entity58 , playing in only his second match for @entity3 , looked the most comfortable on the crease and was rewarded with his first half century			2
the 23 - year - old son of former @entity53 star @entity62 was finally dismissed for 87 when he pushed @entity64 's full toss to @entity65 at mid-wicket			2
@entity3 fast bowler @entity31 ( left ) celebrates dismissing @entity0 batsman @entity67 ' i was really disappointed that i got out that way , ' @entity58 said			1
' i just tried to play my natural game			0
i was n't thinking much			0
i was just trying to put it out of mind that wickets were falling around me			0
' @entity64 was the most successful @entity0 bowler with 3 - 60 , including a great delivery to remove @entity53 captain @entity75 , who was looking dangerous on 47			1
after putting together 64 runs for the sixth wicket with @entity58 - the best partnership of the innings - @entity75 was completely foxed by @entity24 's delivery that pitched way outside the off stump and swung back to take his middle stump			2
@entity84 ( 19 ) was the first batsman to go saturday morning , smashing a wide delivery from @entity29 straight into the hands of @entity87 at point			0
the opener could add only three runs to his overnight score of 16			0
@entity92 , who came into the side at the expense of @entity95 , was deceived by @entity96 when he stepped out once too often and was clean bowled for 37 which came in just 28 balls			0
nightwatchman @entity100 vigil 's came to an end on 15 when @entity65 found a way through his forward defensive shot while @entity104 did not have the time to settle down before he was trapped leg before wicket by @entity96			0
a draw or a win would give @entity0 a rare series win over @entity3			1
@entity0 have beaten @entity3 five times before at home , but their last series victory came 20 years ago in 1994			1

they hope a 370 - run lead with eight wickets in hand in second innings
@entity0 looking for first series win over @entity3 in 20 years
