three @entity1 accused of executing a wounded prisoner in @entity3 had been sickened by the @entity4 hanging limbs of maimed comrades in trees as trophies , a court martial heard			1
tensions had built up before the killing after insurgents paraded the body parts of close colleagues blown up by improvised explosive devices			1
the gruesome detail emerged as one of the commandos admitted he was ashamed of shooting the captured enemy in the chest at point - blank range with a 9mm pistol			1
death scene : the court martial board watch footage of the shooting of a @entity4 fighter			1
the hearing was told that tensions had built up before the killing after insurgents paraded the body parts of maimed @entity1 but the experienced sergeant , who can only be identified as @entity32 , insisted he believed the gunman was already dead when he pulled the trigger			1
he blamed lack of self - control and poor judgement for the ‘ @entity40 ’ decision sparked by ‘ pent - up emotions ’			2
the three @entity1 – identified as @entity41 – are accused of murdering the prisoner during a patrol in @entity44 on september 15 , 2011			1
@entity45 and @entity46 allegedly encouraged and assisted @entity32 @entity47 all three deny the charges			2
they are said to have killed the seriously wounded prisoner , whose body has never been found , after an @entity53 attack helicopter pilot strafed him with cannon fire as he attacked a @entity56 base			2
giving evidence from behind a screen , @entity32 , 39 , said ‘ tensions and stress ’ among the men of @entity62 had increased in the run - up to the incident because of the frantic pace of operations			2
in one instance , a respected officer and a second colleague were killed and others badly wounded in a roadside bomb strike			2
some of the injured men ’s limbs were not recovered and were picked up by the @entity4 and hung in trees as a ‘ kind of trophy for the world to see ’			0
he said that atrocity had ‘ quite a harsh effect ’ on the @entity1			1
on the day of the alleged murder @entity32 ’s patrol was ordered to check the insurgent targeted in the helicopter attack			0
hearing : members of the defence legal team sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three @entity1 accused of the murder of an un-named enemy combatant footage of the shooting was captured on a camera mounted on the helmet of @entity97 , which has been played to the court martial in @entity99 , @entity100			1
it shows the insurgent – who had been armed with an @entity104 assault rifle and a grenade – being dragged roughly across a field to the cover of trees			0
@entity32 admitted this was ‘ heavy - handed ’			0
the sergeant , who has served in @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity3 , is then filmed walking forward , bending down and shooting the detainee in the centre of his chest			1
as the @entity3 spasms and gasps for breath , @entity32 taunted : ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil , you c * * *			0
it ’s nothing you would n’t do to us			0
’ he then turned to comrades and said : ‘ i just broke the @entity125			0
’ yesterday @entity32 accepted video footage of the incident suggested the man was ‘ probably ’ still alive when he pulled the trigger			0
but he insisted : ‘ it was my belief that at the time i discharged my pistol he was dead			1
’ he claimed to be ‘ very surprised ’ when the prisoner began convulsing after the shooting			2
poor judgement : @entity32 told the court martial , sitting at the @entity138 at @entity99 , @entity100 , that he believed the gunman was already dead and blamed a lack of self - control for the shooting ‘ he suddenly became very animated after i had discharged my firearm			1
i questioned if i was right			0
had i made a mistake ? ’ asked by his barrister , @entity146 , why he had shot an apparent corpse , @entity32 said : ‘ stupid , lack of control , a momentary lapse of judgment			0
’ he denied the footage of him telling the insurgent to ‘ shuffle off this mortal coil ’ was evidence he knew he was alive , insisting the remark was ‘ foolish bravado … something i ’m not proud of ’			0
he said he had believed he had broken the @entity125 because he had mistreated a body			1
the court martial heard that back at base he briefly discussed the incident with his comrades , telling them ‘ i * * * * ed up there , lads ’			1
but he did not talk about it again until he was arrested a year later because he was ‘ ashamed of my actions ’			2
he also said he treated a remark by @entity169 that he should ‘ pop ’ the insurgent with a bullet to the head as a ‘ throwaway comment … dark humour ’ used by troops as a ‘ coping mechanism ’			0
@entity32 admitted he told a number of lies in interviews with the @entity180			0
@entity181 , prosecuting , said he had omitted the ‘ one key and crucial ’ piece of evidence in his first interview with investigators – that he had fired his pistol			0
