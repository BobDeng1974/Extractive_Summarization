by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 30 september 2013 local delicacy : grasshoppers , which are already commonly eaten in @entity3 , will provide the base for the first batches of @entity6 scientists have begun work to develop a protein rich flour , called @entity6 , which is made from insects and could feed millions in malnourished populations			1
students from @entity14 in @entity15 were awarded the $ 1 million dollar @entity16 to help with the production of the sustainable food staple which can produced and consumed in poor countries			1
initially the team plan to recruit farmers to work on production in @entity3 , where around 4 million people live in poverty and their is widespread malnutrition			2
the first batches of the flour will be made from grasshoppers , which are already common fare in the @entity31 nation			2
@entity32 is the leader of the @entity14 team who pioneered what could be a revolutionary food stuff for the developing world			2
speaking to @entity38 , he said : ' it 's a huge deal because we had a very ambitious but highly executable five - year plan in place			0
' so winning this prize is a great step in that direction			0
' @entity32 worked along with teammates @entity46 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
they are now setting up an advisory board to oversee the first stages of @entity6 production			1
speaking of their decision to begin with the humble grasshopper , @entity32 explained the importance of using insects which are already familiar in the local diet			1
he said farmers have already expressed interest in raising grasshoppers on a mass level			0
the project is expected to be popular in areas of the world where insects are already a palatable food source			0
in many nations outside the western world they are already considered an important source of protein			0
and the type of insect used in each nation can vary depending on local eating habits			1
people of @entity80 , for example , prefer palm weevils whereas in @entity83 caterpillars are popular			0
the committed scientists who developed the product said they have consumed kilos of the creepy crawlies as part of their research			0
staple : the bugs will be used to produce a flour that is ' rich in protein ' foodstuff : insects have already made their way into some western dishes , such as this @entity98 plate from @entity99 , but scientists they can be used for good in poor malnourished populations @entity32 said : ' @entity46 was recently researching in @entity102 and tried everything from worms to water beetles ' even @entity50 , who is a vegetarian member of the team , consumed his fair share of basil - flavored palm weevil			1
@entity32 said : ' he 's a vegetarian for ethical and ecological reasons , and when he looked at insects , for him it was really not an issue as far as being a source of protein that is ecologically balanced '			1

scientists scoop prize for developing protein rich ' @entity6 '
production could boost *economy* in poorer countries
it can be made from different insects depending on local taste
