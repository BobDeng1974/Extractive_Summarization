@entity0 was hit with a three - match ban on wednesday for stamping on @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 , but the @entity5 defender escaped any further action after he appeared to mock the @entity7 by posting a picture of clowns on social media			1
the photograph appeared on @entity0 ’s @entity13 account on wednesday morning , shortly before the @entity7 announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on @entity14 towards the end of @entity5 ’s 2 - 1 defeat to their rivals at @entity18 on sunday			1
the @entity7 are aware of the post but have decided not to take the matter further			0
@entity0 's foot lands on @entity2 's leg in the incident which saw the @entity7 charge the defender @entity0 could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the @entity7 upheld his ban @entity28 : @entity29 away , april 4 @entity30 sixth round : @entity32 away , april 8 @entity28 : @entity33 at home , april 13 @entity0 , 30 , had denied the @entity7 charge which was brought on the basis of video evidence , after referee @entity38 confirmed that he did not see the incident with @entity14			1
the @entity41 defender becomes the second @entity5 player to be banned for violent conduct in the game after @entity45 was given an automatic three - game suspension for stamping on @entity47 just 38 seconds after coming on as a half - time substitute			1
both players will now miss the trip to third - placed @entity29 a week on saturday and @entity33 ’s visit to @entity18 on april 13 , as well as @entity5 ’s @entity30 quarter - final replay at @entity32 five days earlier			1
@entity5 also have a number of injury concerns arising from the @entity3 game			2
@entity56 ( hip ) and @entity58 ( groin ) have withdrawn from @entity61 duty , while @entity62 is expected to do the same after playing in tomorrow ’s @entity64 qualifier against @entity65 at @entity66			0
@entity0 was charged with violent conduct but claimed the alleged stamp was not intentional a three - man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by @entity38 ( right ) @entity72 has a major selection headache ahead of the trip to @entity29 in the @entity28 @entity62 has been having injections in a toe injury and is unlikely to risk aggravating the problem by playing in tuesday ’s friendly with @entity78			2
goalkeeper @entity79 has been having scans on an ankle injury at @entity83 ’s training camp after colliding with @entity84 on sunday and @entity85 has pulled out of the @entity87 squad with a recurring abdominal strain			0
@entity85 would have been an ideal candidate to replace @entity0 , who made no secret of his feelings yesterday when the @entity7 announced that he had been found guilty of deliberately treading on @entity14 ’s right shin			0
a three - man panel of elite officials reviewed the footage on monday and agreed unanimously that it was a red card offence			0
the 30 - year - old denied the charge and argued that any contact with @entity14 was unintentional , but an independent disciplinary commission decided otherwise yesterday			1
captain @entity45 was sent off after stamping on @entity3 's @entity47 on sunday @entity45 will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2 - 1 defeat an @entity7 statement was released at lunchtime shortly after @entity0 had posted a photograph of four clowns on social media in what was interpreted as a clear dig at the authorities			1
the @entity7 have been known to punish thinly - veiled criticism before — not least when @entity114 manager @entity113 was fined £ 10,000 last season for bringing the game into disrepute after making sarcastic comments about match officials following a defeat by @entity121			0
it is understood that they did not think there was enough evidence on this occasion to justify a similar charge against @entity0			2
he is currently in @entity128 preparing for tomorrow night ’s @entity64 qualifier against @entity130 and next week ’s friendly against the @entity131			0
considering the problems afflicting @entity72 and his @entity18 squad at the moment , it is probably just as well .			0
