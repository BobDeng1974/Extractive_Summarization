@entity51 , a @entity52 member of the @entity54 health select committee , said : ‘ @entity9 are complete hypocrites to be making capital about this for three reasons			1
‘ first , they allowed @entity23 to opt out of responsibility for their patients out - of - hours , leading to an instant jump in people turning up at @entity7			1
‘ second , they cut 50,000 hospital beds while they were in power , meaning there is not enough capacity			0
and finally they failed to predict and plan for the demographic expansion , particularly of older , frailer people			0

' that is a better performance than anywhere else in the @entity96			0
’ he added : ‘ i think there is a bit more hope behind the disappointing figures – and they are disappointing – than perhaps some of the headlines today are suggesting			0

he added : ‘ we ’ve got a longer - term issue which is making sure there are named gps in your local area which are responsible for every single frail , elderly person			0
' a lot of the pressure on @entity7 is coming from frail , elderly people , often with many different health conditions , and the best place for them , frankly , is not @entity7			0
