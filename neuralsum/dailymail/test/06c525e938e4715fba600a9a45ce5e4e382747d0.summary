no video captured what happened to @entity2 inside the police van where officers heaved him into a metal compartment after pinning him to a sidewalk			1
the cause of his fatal spine injury has not been revealed			1
but a troubling detail emerged as hundreds of protesters converged on @entity12 again thursday : he was not only handcuffed and put in leg irons , but left without a seat belt during his trip to the station , a police union 's lawyer said			2
unbelted detainees have been paralyzed and even killed by rough rides in what used to be called ' paddy wagons			2
' it even has a name : ' nickel rides , ' referring to cheap amusement park thrills			1
' deadly nickel ride ' : @entity2 , 25 , was arrested on april 12 in @entity28 and died a week later from a severe spinal injury that may have been caused when he was shackled and driven to the police station in a paddy wagon without being strapped into a seatbelt ' nickel rides ' have caused spinal injuries in the past and @entity28 police epartment rules were updated nine days before @entity2 's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device police brutality against prisoners being transported was addressed just six months ago in a plan released by @entity28 officials to reduce this misconduct			1
department rules updated nine days before @entity2 's arrest clearly state that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or ' other authorized restraining devices ' for their own safety after arrest			1
@entity2 was not belted in , said attorney @entity51 , who represents at least one of the officers under investigation			1

@entity2 died on sunday , april 19 , after he ' had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck ' while in police custody ' policy is policy , practice is something else , ' particularly if a prisoner is combative , @entity51 told @entity65			1
' it is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small , and this one was very small			2
' assistant police commissioner @entity71 said @entity2 was secured by ' leg irons ' after he became agitated during the trip , but the department has n't said whether he was buckled in with a seat belt			1
the @entity2 family 's lawyer , @entity76 , said ' his spine was 80 percent severed ' while in custody			1
it 's not clear whether he was injured by officers in the street or while being carried alone in the van 's compartment			2
but if it happened on the way to the station , it would n't be the first such injury in @entity28 : @entity89 died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt , with his hands cuffed behind his back			1
' we argued they gave him what we call a ` rough ride , '' at high speed with hard cornering , said attorney @entity102			2
' he was thrown from one seat into the opposite wall , and that 's how he broke his neck			2
' @entity102 obtained a $ 7.4 million judgment for the family , later reduced to the legal cap of $ 200,000			0
it also has happened in @entity111 , where police in 2001 barred transportation of prisoners without padding or belts after the @entity117 reported that the city had paid $ 2.3 million to settle lawsuits over intentionally rough rides , which permanently paralyzed two people			2
