@entity1 ’s return to the summit of the @entity3 will surprise no one			1
a @entity6 hat - trick might have been a different story			1
the @entity9 defender is not noted for his goalscoring			2
in a season blighted by injury for the most part he has n’t been noted for very much at all			2
yet , on his return from injury for a first appearance since november , the half - time substitute eased his way back in with two goals in seven minutes – one a diving header – and came to within inches of adding a third			1
@entity6 scores his second , and @entity1 's fourth , goal of the evening with a diving header @entity25 scores the opening goal of the game in the clash between @entity1 and @entity29 the woodwork proved @entity29 ’s salvation more than once here			1
with @entity1 2 - 0 up at half - time it prevented the home team from making a very comfortable victory a rout			1
@entity6 turned a @entity39 centre into the net with a slightly mis - hit left foot shot in 75 minutes			1
he added his second with a spectacular looping , diving header from 10 yards from a @entity45 cross			1
had he added a third we might all have been calling @entity48 , the club ’s last free - scoring full - back , for a comment			2
as it turned out , a low @entity54 centre in the final minutes was turned against the upright from 12 yards			2
the statisticians could rest easy			2
more so , at least , than a @entity29 team tormented here from start to finish			0
the @entity62 has admirers in @entity64 and @entity65 and has been linked with both @entity67 clubs this month already			0
they do n’t seem so sure about him in the @entity1 support			1
yet after three weeks on the sidelines he was the first @entity1 returnee to remind doubters what he brings to @entity73 ’s team			1
the @entity74 celebrates his goal with left back @entity76 on wednesday evening @entity77 striker @entity45 then doubles the hosts ' lead with another header in the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation favoured by the @entity82 , @entity60 is forging a new role as a creator on the left side			1
it ’s not clear he fancies his new role much			0
yet two first half assists in this routine , mundane victory suggest he wo n’t be back in his favoured berth as an out and out poacher again any time soon			2
when his corner struck the first defender in 26 minutes they howled their derision			2
in response @entity60 gathered the ball in and thumped a probing ball to the back post where @entity25 headed the opener into the roof of the net			1
like @entity60 , @entity104 is another of the wanted men			0
the attraction of selling now for a £ 10million fee is obvious			0
but it ’s not only defending which makes @entity73 determined to stick			0
scoring his seventh of the season the centre - half became @entity1 ’s third highest goalscorer after @entity115 and @entity60			1
@entity45 might feature in the upper reaches soon enough			1
he headed a fine goal two minutes from half - time			1
a quick free - kick from @entity120 sent @entity121 scuttling down the left flank			0
the cross which prompted @entity45 to crane back his neck and guide the ball into the net for 2 - 0 was quality			1
@entity45 celebrates doubling his side 's lead by leaping through the air @entity6 then added a third goal to seal the win with 15 minutes remaining at half - time it was a question of how many @entity1 wanted			1
seeking to overhaul @entity136 at the top of the table – with a game in hand – the response was empatic			0
@entity29 entered this match on a run of three straight defeats			0
after winning their opening two matches under @entity147 the @entity145 side arrived in @entity149 ’s east end knowing they could drop into the bottom two if they lost and @entity150 won			0
in the event the @entity152 side fell short			0
but so did @entity29 here and by some distance			0
it may have been a lack of ambition , more likely a lack of ability and experience , with captain @entity161 absent with a broken toe			0
despite the return of @entity164 to a claret shirt , however , the @entity29 barely mustered a venture over the halfway line			0
@entity164 did loft a deft cross towards the back post on the half hour which nearly dropped inside the post			2
yet @entity1 – with @entity54 in the starting line - up again – had a spring in their step			1
throwing his boots to the crowd in @entity176 at the weekend @entity54 created a few headlines as he gave impression he was off			0
they found him a new pair last night , but almost sent out a call for the old pair when he lashed an early effort from a @entity60 lay - off high and wide			0
the two managers watch on from the sidelines during the @entity3 clash a minute 's silence is observed before the game at @entity191 in remembrance of fan @entity193 he blew a later chance for 3 - 0 after an hour , sidefooting an easy chance from a @entity45 centre too close to keeper @entity198 , then hammered a right foot shot straight at the keeper moments later			1
if last year ’s player of the year finally signs a new contract – and it looks unlikely – this wo n’t be the night which seals it			0
he was by no means a solitary offender in the art of wasting great chances			0
@entity1 should probably have finished the night with six			1
@entity208 , @entity29 ’s lively teenage substitute at half - time , threatened the briefest of revivals when he thumped a fine chance into the side - netting in 49 minutes from 16 yards			1
but it was an illusion			0
@entity216 still toiled to stay warm as @entity1 resumed normal service			2
@entity218 – taken off with @entity29 ’s @entity219 after a clash of heads – struck the inside of the post with a stooping header from an @entity76 cross to the back post in 58 minutes			2
three minutes later the @entity228 left - back achieved a staggering miss when he lashed a @entity45 squared ball against the face of the bar from six yards			1
falling to the ground , slapping the turf , his disbelief was shared by many			0
in @entity1 had one defender , at least , who had his eye in			2
he took his goals in some style as some key performers returned from injury a mere 10 days before an @entity243			0
sheer coincidence of course .			0

@entity25 opened the scoring for the hosts in the 26th minute
@entity45 then doubled @entity1 's lead two minutes before the break
@entity6 sealed the win with a brace in the second half
