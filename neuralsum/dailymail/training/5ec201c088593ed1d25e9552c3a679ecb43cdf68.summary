there 's been a buzz about chia seeds since last year , when they were touted as the latest superfood			1
the likes of @entity6 and model @entity7 are fans of the @entity11 seeds , which are stuffed full of nutrients and healthy fats			0
but it seems cold - pressed chia oil is following in the footsteps of other so - called superfoods - almonds , goji berries , acai and even broccoli , which have all found their benefits harnessed in skincare			1
@entity24 is now being heralded as the latest ' wonder ' ingredient in a raft of new anti-ageing face serums			0
the oil is one of the richest sources of heart - healthy omega - 3 fatty acids			1
@entity35 's @entity34 model @entity7 , left , is a believer in chia serums such as @entity39 's product , right although they may seem like a modern foodie fad , these little seeds have a history that dates back centuries			2
once worshipped by the @entity45 as the food of the gods , chia comes from the same family as mint and became a staple food in @entity11 where it was as widely cultivated as maize			0
@entity54 fatty acids - also found in fish oils and flax seeds - are vital for the skin and help improve the health of the skin barrier , meaning it retains more moisture			1
@entity24 provides more omega - 3 fatty acids than flax seed , but it does n't go off as easily			1
it is also high in antioxidants , vitamins and minerals , so can help protect , calm and rebuild the skin , as well as moisturising it			0
one indicator that chia , more formally known by its @entity71 name @entity24 , is about to be big in skincare is the fact @entity75 clinical dermatologist @entity74 has made it the star ingredient of his latest product , @entity79 ( £ 59.95 , perriconemd.co.uk )			1
' as a dermatologist , i believe essential fatty acids are vitally important to beautiful skin , ' says dr @entity74			1
' chia seeds are one of the richest vegetable sources of essential fatty acids and can keep the skin soft , supple and youthful			1
@entity6 , left , uses chia serums such as @entity88 , right ' cold - pressed , extra virgin chia oil , especially when combined with fat - soluble vitamins and nutrients , rapidly transforms skin to give a vibrant , glowing and more healthy complexion			1
' ninety per cent of women who took part in a trial of the product for dr @entity74 said their skin felt more hydrated after using it , and 88 per cent found that using it for a week helped their skin retain moisture and helped make - up go on more smoothly			2
another high - tech anti-ageing product containing chia oil is @entity106 's @entity88 ( £ 58 , the - comfort - zone.co.uk )			1
' what makes chia oil so good for the skin is its powerful anti-inflammatory properties , ' says @entity110 , of the company			2
' chronic skin inflammation has long been recognised as a major cause of ageing			0
@entity115 , @entity116 supercritical @entity117 one @entity119 ' @entity118 ' it 's caused by our modern lifestyle , with its bad food choices , lack of exercise and high levels of stress , and it attacks our cells silently			0
anti-inflammatory ingredients like chia oil help protect skin and correct the visible signs of skin ageing			2
' @entity24 oil is also a great source of antioxidant b vitamins , which play an anti-ageing role in skin by protecting it from damaging free radicals - unstable molecules that attack our skin cells and cause premature ageing			2
' @entity24 oil has a silky - soft feel on the skin and is considered one of the best anti-wrinkle skin oils , ' says @entity115 , who creates skincare products using pure and natural ingredients for sensitive skin			0
@entity115 includes chia in her @entity116 ( £ 35 , pennybadgerbotanicals.co.uk )			0
' we use chia to soothe fine lines and improve skin elasticity			0
the omega - 3s in chia seed oil also help relieve irritation , dryness and peeling			1
' @entity24 also features in one @entity119 ' products , including @entity161 , £ 23 , and @entity162 , £ 39			0
or you could apply a couple of drops of the oil ( try the plain organic @entity167 , £ 39 , beingcontent.com ) to your normal moisturiser to give it an extra hydrating boost			0
inside and out , it seems this supercharged oil is the quickest way to cheer up your skin for summer .			0
