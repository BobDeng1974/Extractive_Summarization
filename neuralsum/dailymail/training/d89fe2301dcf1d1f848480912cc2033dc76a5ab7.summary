@entity1 managers are refusing to let gps send patients for vital scans to detect cancer			1
family doctors are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for tests and x-rays without having to first go to a hospital specialist , as part of a government drive to speed up diagnosis			1
but an investigation has found that two - thirds of @entity1 organisations do not allow @entity2 to send patients for at least one of four crucial scans to spot cancers with low survival rates			1
of these two thirds , 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients directly for scans to detect bowel cancer , while 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients for scans to detect brain cancer			1
@entity29 patients face a " postcode lottery " due to restrictions imposed by some clinical commissioning groups , the research found some 27 per cent do not give them direct access to checks for ovarian cancer , while 25 per cent do not let them send patients for chest x-rays for lung cancer , which is often diagnosed too late			1
@entity40 has one of the worst cancer survival rates in @entity43 and in 2011 the government pledged to improve this by investing £ 450million to give gps better access to scans			2
these included mri scans for brain cancer , chest x-rays for lung cancer , flexible sigmoidoscopy tests for bowel cancer and ultrasounds for ovarian cancer			1
politicians stated that @entity2 would be allowed to order these tests to be carried out themselves – rather than having to send patients first to a hospital consultant – in the hope of speeding up diagnosis time by several weeks			1
however , @entity63 requests by @entity64 found that only a third give doctors direct access to all four scans			0
in fact , a fifth of the 211 gp - run clinical commissioning groups do not let them refer patients for any of these tests			1
dr @entity73 , deputy chairman of the @entity75 ’s @entity74 , said : ‘ it ’s frustrating			2
there ’s been an increase in pressure on what should be done within the community , but for @entity2 to be empowered to be able to do that , we need the support services and particularly access to diagnostics			0
‘ there ’s no real reason other than cost that prohibits access to services			0
but in many cases , it actually reduces costs overall if you enable @entity2 to have greater access to these types of services , because they can avoid making potentially unnecessary referrals			0
’ earlier this week the @entity1 watchdog @entity99 issued detailed guidance to gps on diagnosing cancer over concerns that failure to spot the disease early enough are costing thousands of lives a year			2
family doctors are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for tests and scans , such as an mri , without having to first go to a hospital specialist ( file picture ) it told doctors to refer patients for tests within 48 hours if they had symptoms including persistent tiredness , a cough or unexplained bruising			1
last month it emerged that the chances of beating cancer in @entity124 still lag behind those elsewhere in @entity43			0
data from the @entity127 shows that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for 19 of the most common cancers , compared to the situation in 2011			0
but for five types they stalled or got worse , including bladder cancer in women , thyroid cancer in both sexes , testicular cancer , @entity139 lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men			0
there is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline			0
however , waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the @entity1 struggles with the rise in patients			2
campaigners said that , despite overall improvement , @entity124 is well behind @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 in its survival rates			0
this has been blamed on @entity2 missing symptoms , and patients not making an appointment when they first experience them .			0

gps are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for crucial scans
two - thirds not allowed to send patients for at least one of four tests
these include scans to detect brain , bowel , lung and ovarian cancer
