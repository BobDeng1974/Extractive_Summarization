by @entity0 published : 06:06 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 06:07 est , 22 july 2013 pharmaceutical companies could be forced to publish secret research into how drugs are created under new @entity5 laws , potentially revealing information about dangerous and unknown side - effects			1
the rules would mean that some of the world ’s most powerful drugs companies would have to share the results of clinical trials which could then be analysed by independent scientists			1
experts said that the move could also highlight if patients and customers have been fooled by placebos or drugs that have not been scientifically proven to work			1
drugs companies currently only release a small amount of their research data from clinical trials , with critics claiming that negative results are only half as likely to be published			1
the proposed rules would mean that some of the world 's most powerful drugs companies would have to share the results of clinical trials which could then be analysed by independent scientists but the disclosure rules being drawn up by the @entity32 , an @entity34 body , have been met with resistance from pharmaceutical companies			1
they claim that some of their information might be misinterpreted , potentially sparking a significant health scare around the use of a particular the drug			0

there ’s a hidden agenda here			0
‘ patient groups get traction because they are assumed to represent the voice of the suffering			0
