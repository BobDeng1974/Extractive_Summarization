by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 3 september 2013 it is a glass - walled palace that is so open you can see what is going on in the bedrooms			0
but now @entity5 appears to be having second thoughts about privacy at his $ 75m @entity9 mansion - and is taking steps to keep the public away			1
the designer has put up signs warning about poison ivy and ticks around the property , which has taken three years to build and is finally nearly completion			1
people in glass mansions : @entity5 has nearly finished his $ 75m glass - walled @entity9 mansion but may be second - guessing his revealing choices southern exposure : the ' minimalist ' @entity9 beachfront home has elicited gawkin geven from billionaire neighbors and @entity5 has put up a modest screen in front of his shower that was once exposed to the street he has also employed security guards to patrol the area and installed cameras to keep watch on the throngs who have been coming to gawk at the home			1
the reason is supposedly that @entity5 appears to be having a rethink about how much of his private life he wants to show off			1
he built the stunning minimalist mansion with floor to ceiling glass so that even the shower was visible to the public until he put up a modesty screen			1
according to a recent piece in the @entity46 , even from the road the ‘ figure of a wiry man with spiky hair and a white t - shirt ’ - @entity5 - could easily be seen going about his business inside			1
see - through : @entity5 has posted do not enter signs that warn of poison ivy and ticks as well as guards to shoo away nosy billionaire neighbors eager to peak at the transparent spectacle the original idea was that the mansion would be ‘ naturalistic ’ and blend in with the surroundings which , in this case , is the beach and the dunes on an exclusive part of @entity67 , @entity68			1
now , however , the @entity69 reported that signs around the property have been put up which read : ‘ caution , @entity73 and ticks present : do not enter			1
’ the security guards have been fitted with white shirts and black trousers and patrol all over the property			0
decadent : @entity5 has a history of real estate indulgence			1
he once bought an unfinished @entity81 penthouse then flew a helicopter to where his windows would be to assess his future view some also stand at the end of the driveway to stop curious passers - by from peeking in			0
part of the reason for the increased security measures is that @entity5 ’s house is finally nearing completion and has become the talk of @entity9 , no mean feat when other residents include @entity96 and @entity97			1
on the same stretch of sand the neighbors include @entity101 and @entity102 and hotelier @entity103			0
this summer @entity104 and @entity105 also moved into a $ 200,000 a week rental home in @entity107 , a short drive further @entity109			0
@entity5 spends six days a week in the property and has supposedly personally vetted every single object inside			2
every room has sliding doors so that the space can be reorganized at his whim			0
there are white sofas in every room , @entity116 - made chairs by @entity121 , vintage furniture by @entity123 , an infinity pool and a neighboring building he plans to use as a screening room - it is joined to the main house by an underground passageway			0
during the construction process @entity5 built a life - size mock up of the property made of plywood which needed its own building permits and cost some $ 350,000 all on its own			2
the castle that once stood on the property has an extremely colorful history - it used to be owned by the tycoon @entity138 but after his death it was bought by @entity141 and his wife @entity142 , who became famous for partying with @entity143 in the 1970s			0
in the 1980s the house was owned by financier @entity145 who enraged the locals when he taped a 24 - karat gold mezuzah to the front door			0
once upon a time : a castle once stood on the property , but @entity5 tore it down to build his glass house			2
the extravagant mansion featured an indoor shark tank and waterfall residents branded it ‘ a @entity162 castle on lsd ’ , not least because of the indoor shark tank and the 20ft waterfall out the back			0
@entity5 bought it in 2003 for $ 30m and later had it all knocked down			2
according to the @entity46 , his obsession with perfection fits with a pattern of taking real estate extremely seriously			0
when @entity5 bought a triplex penthouse in the @entity171 of the @entity173 building in @entity81 in 2000 , one of the first things he did was fly in a helicopter to where his windows were going to be to get a look at what his view would be like			2
a spokesman for @entity5 said he ‘ always has had security at his houses over the years			0
’ the spokesman said : ‘ yes , there are signs warning of ticks because the deer are rampant out here and people are warning of late of the grave danger @entity191 presents to anyone exposed ’ .			1

the *wealthy* designer has put up keep out signs and others that warn of ticks and poison ivy
even billionaire neighbors are stopping by for a peak
the ' naturalistic ' mansion with *bay* and ocean views could be more exposed than @entity5 *bargained* for
