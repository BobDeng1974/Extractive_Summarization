by @entity0 an ancient spring which laid the foundations for the historic town of @entity4 has dried up for what is believed to the first time in its 400 - year history			1
the discovery of the iron - rich waters of the @entity10 in 1606 prompted the building of the spa town as people flocked in search of its supposed health - giving properties			1
but this summer , 408 years after @entity17 drank from the spring and found his hangover cured , the waters have stopped flowing beneath the town 's historic @entity21 area			1
run out ? the famous @entity10 in @entity4 has been closed to visitors after it ran dry tourist attraction : the ' dippers ' in period dress who serve the water noticed water levels were low in may @entity4 began in the 17th century after a nobleman tasted the waters that seeped from the ground in may , the @entity4 ' dippers ' in period costume who serve up the orange waters to thirst visitors for £ 1 a time noticed that it was becoming harder to fill their cups			1
but this week , town hall bosses had to admit defeat and close the @entity42 to tourists as there was no longer any water to serve			2
while the water levels flowed slowly in 2011/2012 , this is the first time the waters have stopped flowing at all at the spring under the @entity21			0
a spokesman for @entity50 said : ' we do n't know what has caused the water to stop			0
it ca n't be right to say the spring itself has dried up , given all the rain we 've had , but it has stopped flowing under the @entity21			0
' we have had to close the dipper service as a result , but hopefully it will return soon			0
' the @entity21 spring is usually open five days a week from may to september every year			0
@entity61 , the property investment firm that owns the @entity21 , said they were looking into why the water had run dry			2
historic : the @entity66 and @entity10 are in the @entity21 area , known for its @entity69 colonnades now the historic spa town 's residents are worried about the impact on tourism , which provides 30 per cent of @entity4 ' income			1
resident @entity75 , 46 , said : ' what is a spa town with no spring ? ' the spa town , known for its conservative , ' disgusted ' residents , was built around the @entity10 in the early 1600s after the nobleman noticed the orangey - brown waters seeping from the ground and tasted them			1
he instantly declared the waters a cure for hangovers , obesity and a ' moist brain ' , and recommended the area to friends and noblemen in @entity92			0
by the time @entity95 , wife of @entity96 , visited in 1630 , it had established itself as a spa retreat , with visitors flocking from @entity92 and elsewhere in the country			0
the @entity10 ( pronounced @entity100 ) @entity101 was discovered by @entity17 408 years ago by the 1700s , a visit to the spring at @entity4 had become an essential part of any well - to - do resident or visitor 's day			1
the town 's tourist website reports : ' the day started with a glass of spring water , followed by a promenade on ' @entity111 ' or a visit to the coffee house for the latest gossip , then off to church at the nearby @entity116 , @entity117			2
' the afternoon was spent with more promenading , gambling , or a friendly match on one of the nearby bowling greens , and finished with further gambling , dancing or a musical soiree or grand ball in the evening			0
' historians say the @entity10 water was served by a ' dipper ' for a small charge which covered not the water itself but the service of it being handed to the drinker			0
@entity4 enjoyed huge popularity with the royal family in the 1800s , with visits from the @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 , and in 1909 @entity140 granted the town its ' @entity143 ' status in honour of this			2
in 2010 tourists were banned from drinking the spring water after harmful bacteria were found in it , and the following year the spring was closed temporarily when water levels dropped , but this is the first time that the spring is thought to have dried up completely .			1

@entity154 , iron - rich waters of the @entity10 were discovered in 1606
@entity157 drank them with a hangover and felt better
he told his *aristocrat* and *fashionable* friends , who flocked to drink there
as a result , the spa town of @entity4 grew up around the spring
tourists have long enjoyed sampling the ' health - giving ' waters for £ 1 a cup
but now the waters have run dry , so the tourist *attaction* has been closed
the water has run low before , but it 's not dried up in its 408 year history
