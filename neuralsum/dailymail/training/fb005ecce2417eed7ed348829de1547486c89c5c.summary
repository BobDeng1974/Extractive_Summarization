the first tussle of this year 's @entity1 appears to have been won by the @entity2 after @entity4 captain @entity3 lost the early fashion battle with an ill - advised tartan jacket and gilet			1
the @entity1 has a long history of awful clothing , and while @entity3 's combo will not trouble the the @entity2 shirts at @entity13 in 1999 for top spot in the hall of shame , it is nevertheless not a promising start to the sartorial week in @entity17			1
but @entity3 , who was waiting to greet the @entity2 team at @entity20 airport , soon saw the opposition also score an own goal as @entity23 unveiled a new haircut featuring ' @entity2 ' shaved into the right side			1
@entity3 , captain of @entity4 , was spotted sporting a tartan jacket and gilet as he waited with his wife , @entity30 ( right ) , and @entity31 , @entity17 's @entity32 ( left ) , for the @entity2 team at @entity34 @entity23 's shocking haircut was unveiled as the @entity37 team disembarked from their flight @entity3 's tartan jacket may not be spotted at a @entity40 near you any time soon , but it is still a welcome tribute to the hosts of this year 's @entity1 , which is being held at @entity45 in @entity17 and tees off proper with friday 's foursomes and fourballs			1
while @entity2 fans heading into the office this week are advised not to copy @entity23 's brash barnet , the 25 - year - old @entity52 's patriotic passion for the competition also comes shining through			2
in perhaps the biggest shock of all on monday , it was @entity57 who was spotted wearing the most sensible dress			2
the flamboyant @entity59 , who has sported @entity61 slacks and tartan trousers among many bold designs , was spotted hitting balls on the range in a plain grey jumper			0
@entity57 , surprisingly , was the most demurely dressed star on show , wearing grey at @entity45 the @entity4 team kit - designed by @entity70 - for the competition proper is a closely - guarded secret and the attire will only become known on the morning of each day 's play			2
the @entity2 kit has been designed by @entity76 , and has divided opinion so far			0
but whatever they 're wearing , it 's going to be a great week			0
so long as they avoid the depths of @entity13 , that is			0
the late , great @entity83 wearing the @entity2 team 's kit at @entity13 in 1999 ( plus his signature plus - fours )			0
