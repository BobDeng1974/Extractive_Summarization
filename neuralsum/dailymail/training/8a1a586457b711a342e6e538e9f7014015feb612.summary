@entity1 's troubled child abuse inquiry suffered a fresh setback last night as it emerged that a rival investigation is to be held by a top human rights lawyer			1
@entity5 , who represented @entity6 at the inquests into the deaths of princess @entity9 and @entity6 ’s son @entity10 , has been appointed as the judge of a new ‘ people ’s tribunal ’ on historic abuse claims			1
the home secretary ’s official inquiry has barely started , even though it was launched several months ago			1
but just like the government ’s inquiry , the new tribunal – set up by child abuse campaigners – has been beset by problems			1
only weeks after the steering committee was appointed , four members resigned , citing attacks on social media			2
home secretary @entity1 's ( pictured ) troubled child abuse inquiry has now suffered a fresh setback with the formation of a rival investigation among them was ex-social worker @entity45 , a leading child protection expert			1
organisers insist it is not in conflict with the government ’s inquiry but will instead complement it			2
however , its website suggests that there will be an element of competition			0
it says : ‘ this tribunal is necessary because the @entity49 initiative has serious shortcomings			0
’ questions have also been raised about its funding			0
organisers say they hope to raise money from the public , partly by selling wristbands carrying the slogan ‘ sweep away the secrecy ’			0
the tribunal will hold public hearings across @entity69 at which abuse survivors will tell their stories , and will produce a report within a year that will be submitted to @entity1 ’s inquiry as well as other institutions			1
as it is entirely unofficial , it has no legal powers requiring witnesses to come forward			0
mrs may will face questions from @entity81 tomorrow on the lack of progress with the investigation and the struggle to find a suitable chairman			0
at least 100 names have been put forward after mrs @entity24 had to step down , following @entity89 ’s revelation that she has close links to former home secretary @entity91 .			2

new investigation established to look into historic child abuse claims
it is to run in competition with the home secretary 's troubled inquiry
