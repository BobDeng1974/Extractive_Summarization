survivor : miss @entity17 2013 , @entity2 , has opened up about her battle with thyroid cancer , now finally in remission ' it hurt so bad			1
it felt like i was swallowing an apple every time i was swallowing			2
' when a doctor diagnosed cancer in her thyroid , a gland on the neck , miss @entity2 underwent two urgent surgeries to have it removed - the second just two weeks before the @entity35 pageant			1
she made a fast enough recovery to compete in the state pageant , and indeed win it - no mean feat. but her treatment was not over , as she then completed a grueling course of radiation in january			2
