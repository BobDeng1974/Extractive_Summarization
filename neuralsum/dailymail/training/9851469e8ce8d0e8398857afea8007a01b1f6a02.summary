@entity0 is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile			0
lawyers for the @entity8 peer warned @entity10 users ‘ we know who you are ’ and urged them to come forward voluntarily or face being pursued through the courts			1
his action is intended to stop so - called ‘ trial by @entity10 ’ and , if successful , could radically change the way the internet is policed and make those using social networks more directly accountable for defamatory comments			1
@entity0 , the former @entity8 party treasurer wrongly accused of being a child abuser following a botched @entity24 report , yesterday agreed a £ 185,000 compensation settlement with the @entity26 – funded by licence - payers			1
@entity0 ’s lawyer @entity40 said those suspected of defaming the peer would receive a letter before action was taken telling them they had 48 hours to respond			2
he said there was a ‘ very long list ’ of people to whom letters would be sent			0
@entity0 , 70 , said no amount of compensation could repair the damage to his reputation from being branded a paedophile			0
he told the @entity26 : ‘ there is nothing as bad as this that you can do to people			1
’ describing his revulsion at the false accusations , the former @entity66 aide said : ‘ it gets into your bones , it makes you angry			2
and it gets into your soul			0
you just think there ’s something wrong with the world			0
’ @entity10 gaffe : speaker 's wife @entity36 arrived at the @entity74 to watch a performance of @entity76 last night			1
she is facing a legal claim by @entity0 after joining a frenzy of paedophile speculation and is yet to contact them to apologise the fiasco began on @entity10 when @entity82 , managing editor of the @entity83 , which jointly produced the @entity24 report , sent a @entity10 message saying : ‘ if all goes well we ’ve got a @entity24 out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile			1
’ the message prompted a maelstrom of internet speculation about the man ’s identity , despite @entity24 ’s decision not to broadcast a name that night , november 2			0
on november 4 , mrs @entity36 tweeted , ‘ why is @entity0 trending ? * innocent face * ’ , a reference to the fact the peer ’s name was being repeatedly mentioned on @entity10			1
mrs @entity36 later apologised on @entity10 but @entity0 ’s lawyers said she had not approached them to make a personal apology to the peer			1
mr @entity40 told @entity105 ’s @entity107 programme : ‘ very sadly , we are going to have to take action against a lot of people			0
' the next person on our list is in fact the @entity34 programme , run by @entity35 , where @entity116 managed to embarrass the prime minister ... and then destroy my client ’s reputation			0
’ @entity116 confronted @entity121 with a supposed list of paedophiles live on air last week			0
the @entity24 investigation into child sex allegations at the @entity129 children ’s home in @entity130 in the 1970s was a joint project with the @entity83 , which is also being sued by @entity0			2

tweet : @entity36 was ordered to pay £ 15,000 , which was donated to charity , after posted the above tweet @entity26 director general @entity141 resigned over the fiasco and mr @entity82 quit his job over his disastrous @entity10 message			1
@entity0 ’s lawyers said anyone who had made allegations on social media should contact them or face a legal battle			2
mr @entity40 said : ‘ let it be a lesson to everybody that trial by @entity10 or trial by the internet is a very nasty way of hurting people unnecessarily and it will cost people a lot of money			1
’ as part of yesterday ’s settlement , the @entity26 agreed additionally to pay @entity0 ’s legal costs			2
the bill could approach £ 100,000			0
catalyst : the crisis for @entity0 was all started by @entity24 's ' shabby ' investigation into abuse at a @entity169 children 's home watch the video here @entity24 carried a full , on - air apology for the broadcast a week later and @entity0 ’s @entity107 interview was carried across @entity26 news broadcasts yesterday			1
in the interview , he said he was ‘ conscious ’ that his £ 185,000 settlement would be paid by licence - payers , and not directly by those who made or authorised the programme			0
the @entity83 published an apology to @entity0 on its website ‘ for the extent to which its contribution to the @entity24 broadcast on 2 november fell short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by the @entity83 ’s managing editor ’s tweet in advance of the broadcast ’			0
dressing down : @entity116 and members of the team behind the stunt have been chastised by @entity35 management ambush : this morning presenter @entity116 presented prime minister @entity121 with a list of alleged paedophiles but has now been disciplined by @entity35 after a complaint by @entity0 legal action : @entity0 's solicitor @entity40 ( left ) has warned that anyone who named the @entity8 peer on @entity10 could be sued			1
