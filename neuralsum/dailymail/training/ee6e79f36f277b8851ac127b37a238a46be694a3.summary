the future of @entity1 is set to be decided by @entity2 in april , with the striker reaffirming his desire to stay in @entity5			1
last summer 's loan signing from @entity7 has found life tough in @entity5 - scoring just three @entity10 goals in 12 appearances - but he has bedded himself into @entity14 's side in recent weeks			1
that has served as encouragement for a club shelling out £ 265,000 a week on the @entity18 and means they are now more receptive to a permanent deal than before			1
@entity1 wants to remain at @entity2 beyond his loan spell at the end of the season the @entity18 has started to add consistency to his game for the @entity26 after a tricky start manager @entity14 must decide whether the club should splash out on @entity1 in the summer it would still cost @entity2 around £ 43million to sign @entity1 from the @entity31 side at the end of the season			1
that 's something which the 28 - year - old is desperate to happen			2
' i 'm good , ' @entity1 told @entity37			1
' my family are comfortable			2
we 're enjoying life in @entity41 and here at the club			2
the people have been great with me , with my family			2
we 're happy and very grateful			0
' right from the start , they [ my colleagues ] welcomed me			0
they supported me and helped me with whatever i needed			0
they are a really humble group of players , really decent and , well , i was taken aback by how kind they 've been			0
' @entity1 celebrates scoring for @entity2 against @entity52 at the @entity53 on @entity54 the striker is now improving up front alongside @entity57 ( right ) and @entity58 @entity1 has n't been prolific but has scored two important goals in the recent draws against @entity60 and @entity52 , with @entity2 supporters treated to an archetypal @entity63 celebration			1
' i place a lot of value in the hard work that i have to put in for each goal and i know just how much effort it requires , so that 's why i celebrate like that , ' he explained			1
' for me , each goal means a lot so i put a lot of passion into my celebrations			0
' and that could also be down to the difficulty in finding the net in the @entity10			1
@entity1 has never played in a league quite so quick , but relishes the challenge			1
' it 's more attractive than the @entity83 league , ' he added			0
' defenders are stronger and more aggressive			0
in a good way , you know ? it 's intense and , well , overall just more physical			0
' first of all , i 'd say thank you so much for the way the fans have treated me			0
then i 'd want to wish them a happy 2015 and i hope that we can bring them some happiness			0
