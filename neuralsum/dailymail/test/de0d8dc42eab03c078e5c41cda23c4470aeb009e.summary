@entity1 boss @entity0 ordered his side to end their stuttering away form at @entity6 on saturday to ramp up the pressure on play - off rivals @entity8			1
the @entity10 boss watched his side drop two points against bottom side @entity12 in @entity14 but insisted the 1 - 1 draw — with @entity16 and @entity18 trading goals — could end up being crucial in the quest to finish second			1
rangers have only won once in their last five away matches and @entity0 insists nothing less than a victory will do at the @entity24 this weekend as his side aim to go four clear in second while @entity8 face @entity26 in the @entity28 semi finals			1
@entity0 wants his side to put their away - day blues behind them at @entity6 on saturday ‘ we could be four ahead on saturday night so that might be a very important point for us tonight , ’ said @entity0 on a night when @entity1 fans let off a series of fireworks in the @entity34			1
‘ it ’s still in our hands — but we have got to go and win on saturday ! ‘ of course i ’m disappointed not to win the game			2
we did n’t deserve any more but this was n’t a case of us blowing hot and cold			2
we ’ve no divine right to come here and win			2
‘ i said before the game this would be a tough place to come			2
ok , we did n’t play as fluently as we would have liked but @entity46 were fighting for their lives			0
they are a physical side and @entity8 and @entity50 have still to come here			1
@entity1 dropped two points at @entity53 bottom side @entity12 in their bid for promotion @entity16 gave @entity12 the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset @entity1 ‘ it was a game that panned out the way i expected on a tight park , dry and bumpy			1
it was a fair result			0
you ca n’t stop a free kick like that ( by @entity64 )			0
’ meanwhile , @entity65 was left ruing a first half ‘ goal ’ by @entity16 that was chalked off after a supposed foul by @entity68 on @entity69			0
but the @entity46 boss was also left lamenting his team ’s dire defending 120 seconds after taking the lead through @entity64 ’s fine freekick			0
‘ i think everyone here knows it should have been a goal by @entity16 in the first half , ’ he sighed			0
@entity18 equalised a couple of minutes later for @entity1 at the @entity34 ‘ i ’m just really disappointed			1
it was a terrible goal for us to lose			0
if you go ahead in a match you really want to do better than that			0
when you ’ve taken the lead that ’s your most vulnerable time as a team			0
and i just feel if we had weathered that then @entity1 would have run out of ideas			1
‘ it was not the best we have played but i felt we more than matched @entity1 tonight			1
i watched them on sunday against @entity87 and i thought we could get three points from them and i ’m disappointed we never managed to do that			0

@entity1 held to a 1 - 1 draw by bottom side @entity12 on *wednesday*
the draw means @entity1 have won just one of last five away matches
the point was still enough for @entity1 to move second above @entity8
