by @entity0 teenage shooter @entity2 's bid for @entity5 glory came to an end after a dramatic sudden - death shoot - off in the women 's skeet			1
having shot a disappointing 65 out of 75 in qualifying , 16 - year - old @entity10 faced a three - way shoot - out with @entity14 team - mate @entity13 and @entity15 of @entity16			1
@entity15 was first to crack but @entity13 held her nerve for five rounds of double clays while @entity10 missed with her fifth			1
gone : @entity2 saw her bid for @entity5 glory end in @entity24 it was a sad end for one of @entity14 's best medal hopes but the 2013 @entity28 bowed out gracefully			2
' i 've really enjoyed it and had a really good day , ' she told @entity32			2
' i started off well but had a few problems with my last round but i 've had a great time and it 's been a really good experience			0
' i ca n't say i was n't nervous			0
in the first round nerves were definitely there			0
but i 've got to turn it into the positives and look to the future			0
@entity13 shot an incredible final and deserved to go through			1
in her sights : @entity10 was one of @entity14 's best medal hopes after winning @entity28 's @entity47 award ' it 's fine margins but i 've got a lot of stuff to go back and practice with with my coach			2
we are looking forward to the @entity54 later this year			0
' this is my first @entity56 and i 've never been to a competition of this scale so i 've definitely learned a lot from this and i will use it in competitions in the future			0
' @entity13 , 27 , from @entity63 in @entity64 , will hope to move one step closer to a medal in this afternoon 's six - woman semi-final .			1
