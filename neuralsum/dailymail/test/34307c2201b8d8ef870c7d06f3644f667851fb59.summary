@entity1 coach @entity0 is facing a midfield selection conundrum for wednesday 's @entity4 match across town at @entity6 as the @entity8 champions look to keep up the pressure on leaders @entity11			1
second - placed @entity1 , who hammered @entity13 9 - 1 on sunday with @entity14 forward @entity15 netting his first five - goal haul , are four points behind @entity11 , who host @entity19 earlier on wednesday , with nine games left			1
barring last - minute injuries , @entity0 will have both @entity22 and @entity23 available for the first time in two months since @entity23 broke a bone in his foot and must decide which of the two playmakers joins @entity29 and @entity30 across the centre			0
@entity1 coach @entity0 faces a selection dilemma ahead of wednesday 's match with @entity6 @entity15 scored five goals in @entity1 's 9 - 1 rout of @entity13 on sunday @entity15 's five - star performance is hailed in the monday edition of the @entity40 sports daily as ' the man in the bag ' ran the headline on the front cover of monday 's edition of @entity46 @entity1 are four points behind @entity11 in the race for the @entity4 title @entity22 , a @entity49 international who was suspended for the @entity13 game , performed well first during @entity30 's lengthy injury lay - off and then during the absence of @entity23 and has become a huge favourite with the @entity1 fans			1
@entity0 , by contrast , has been whistled by some sections of the @entity60 crowd as @entity1 stumbled since the turn of the year and if he drops @entity22 and the team stutter again the @entity62 could be in for a torrid time			1
@entity23 returned to action against @entity13 and @entity0 praised him after the game , suggesting he favours the @entity66 , who joined from @entity68 for a fee of Â£ 63m in the close season			0
@entity23 returned to the @entity1 team during the match with @entity13 after two months out @entity22 ( left ) , seen here with @entity30 in training last week , is also set to return to action soon ' he played very well , it did n't look as though he had n't played for two months , ' @entity0 said			1
' he showed his quality , his intensity and his ability to keep possession			0
he is a very direct player and always shows great vision and awareness			0
' after edging @entity82 1 - 0 on sunday , @entity11 will be looking for a more convincing performance at home to struggling @entity19 , who sacked coach @entity86 after saturday 's 4 - 1 home defeat by @entity88			2
@entity11 's @entity90 forward @entity89 , in particular , will be keen to get back among the goals after failing to score in his last three outings in all competitions			0
@entity15 leapfrogged @entity89 to the top of @entity4 's scoring chart with sunday 's five and has 36 , with @entity89 , who holds the record for a single season of 50 , on 32			0
@entity89 will be hoping to return to scoring form when @entity11 play @entity19 on wednesday @entity99 ( right ) scored @entity11 's winner at @entity82 on sunday night			2

@entity1 return to action at @entity6 on wednesday night
they kept up the pressure on @entity11 with a 9 - 1 *thrashing* of @entity13
@entity15 scored five goals in the @entity60 rout
