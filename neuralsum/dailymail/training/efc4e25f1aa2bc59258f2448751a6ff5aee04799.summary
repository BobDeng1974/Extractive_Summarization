controversial ' baby hatches ' have been proposed for introduction in @entity3 hospitals , following the abandonment of two newborn babies in a week			1
the naked body of a baby girl was discovered buried in the sand at @entity9 in @entity11 's @entity10 on sunday morning , after a baby boy was found alive in a drain in @entity14 just a week ago			2
in the wake of such events , police minister @entity15 called for the introduction of safe drop boxes for babies which allow mothers to anonymously deposit their babies within a certain time frame of the child 's birth			1
' i think that everything has to be on the table for us to be able to support particularly mothers but families that are in desperate need of help and assistance , ' minister @entity31 said			1
' there 's no doubt that we find ourselves with two cases that are currently under investigation that require us to think seriously about what we need to do to help families that are in crisis			0
' the baby girl discovered buried in the sand was found by two members of the under 6 nippers team as they were digging in the sand dunes about 20 metres from the water 's edge			2
aged six and seven , the two boys found the ' very small ' infant while digging in the sand during their weekly sunday morning session at the southern end of @entity9 in @entity11 's eastern suburbs			0
police were called to the scene at about 10:05am to investigate the ' suspicious ' incident , and officers dressed in full protective gear and masks removed the body by about 1pm			2

' it would n't be the only solution , but as part of a several - pronged approach it could have it 's place , ' dr @entity83 told @entity101			0
last week , a woman was charged yesterday and refused bail , as is accused of leaving her son in a 2.4 metre deep drain in @entity14 in @entity11 's west when he was just one day old			0
the drain was covered by a concrete slab which weighed over 200kg and took six people to lift , including two police officers who had arrived at the scene			0
they were then able to extract the baby boy , who was wrapped in a striped hospital blanket covered in dirt with the peg still attached to his cut umbilical cord			0
' when the baby boy was found in the drain there were typical responses about how rare an event it was , and then a week later another baby is found buried in the sand , so how do we know that it is a rare event ? ' said dr @entity83			2
' we can see that there are cases coming to light where something has gone wrong and a huge amount of harm has occurred , and these are just the cases that we know of , ' he said			0
' my understanding is that these baby hatches have been in practice in countries like @entity141 for close to a decade , where there are 100 centres around the nation where women can leave a baby without details , ' dr @entity83 said			1
the @entity150 organisation in @entity141 opened it 's first facilities in 2000 , and says that in that time it has ' rescued ' 41 babies which have been put up for adoption			1

@entity177 , national president of the @entity179 and @entity180 at the @entity181 said that the baby hatches did not address the core problem at the heart of the issue			1
' the hatches do not address the fundamental problem of concealed pregnancies and creates other problems , ' ms @entity177 told @entity101			0
' what is really needed is support for the mother in helping them come to terms with having a baby , ' she said			2
ms @entity177 said that the hatches could have the potential to encourage people to think of abandoning their children , and pointed to cases in @entity141 where babies with disabilities , older children , and babies that had already died were put in the drop - boxes			1
' the studies make point in saying that pregnant women who are in denial are not in a fit state to put baby in haven , which means these children are still at risk of being harmed - they are in a different category to those women who would deposit a child , ' she said			1
' to me , the solution is to make sure that these women who are most at risk are identified , which might mean no woman leaves the hospital alone , because there seems to be a loophole that very vulnerable women are slipping through			1

' asking what the real issue is here is quite an appropriate question , and the baby hatches can only be a part of the solution			2
' ' i would n't want to see anything like this mean there was less funding or support for women , especially mothers at risk , but the hatches would not be a high - cost operation , they would be an add - on , ' he said			1
' i can just see that there are situations where this might save the life of a baby or their mother			0
' inspector @entity271 says they are yet to identify the mother of the baby girl found in the sand , and urge her to come forward and seek medical assistance			0
officers have expressed their concerns for the welfare of the mother as police are doubtful she gave birth in a hospital			0
officers hope that a post-mortem exam to be carried out on monday will bring them closer to finding the child 's family			0
police are also trawling through hospital , and deaths , births and marriages records in the hope of identifying the baby			0
