by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 06:20 est , 1 march 2013 the @entity1 : new details have emerged of the budget version of @entity5 's iconic smartphone that the firm is rumoured to be working on @entity5 will launch a new , plastic bodied version of the @entity1 at a budget price as early as this year , it has been claimed			1
the long - awaited budget @entity1 will just £ 220 ( $ 330 ) , according to reports - roughly half the cost of a full - blown version of the iconic smartphone			1
it is understood that it will be enclosed in a glossy polycarbonate plastic case , much like the one found on the now - discontinued entry - level macbook			1
it has long been rumoured that @entity5 is preparing a cheaper version of its flagship mobile product , in an attempt to increase the company 's penetration into emerging markets			0
details of the budget @entity1 were published yesterday by @entity29 blog @entity27 , which claimed @entity5 was to defer the release of a larger - screened successor to the @entity1 , but may soon launch a less expensive handset			1
it suggests that the budget @entity1 will be be given a launch price of just $ 330 - similar to the ipad mini - in order to appeal to young , middle class consumers in countries like @entity38 and @entity39			1
the entry - level phone will also be thicker than the @entity1 , @entity40 reports , to make its polycarbonate body more durable , and could come in a variety of colours			1
however , the design of the cheaper @entity1 is said to be similar to its costlier siblings , including a home button beneath its lcd display			2
that means a patent granted the company in january which showed a phone with no home button is likely not the design for the scaled - down smart phone , as was previously speculated			0
earlier this month @entity5 ceo @entity57 let slip during a rare interview that an affordable @entity1 might be in development			2
' we are making moves to make things more affordable ' : comments made by @entity5 ceo @entity57 last month seemed to suggest that the company was working on a cheaper equivalent to the @entity1 for emerging markets @entity1 covers shaped like knuckledusters that sold in their thousands after @entity71 was seen using one have been banned from @entity73 in case they are used to attack people			1
the £ 25 aluminium case became a celebrity must - have after the singer , pictured right , was pictured with hers last year			1
but @entity73 has removed the web pages of sellers , saying the cases are legally classed as weapons and breach its guidelines			0
however , flimsier plastic versions are still for sale			0
' we are making moves to make things more affordable , ' he said at the @entity93 technology and internet conference in @entity94			0
the revelation came after mr @entity57 said that he saw a ' wide open field ' because @entity5 's @entity1 was currently ' only available to 50 per cent of [ mobile phone ] subscribers in the world '			2
asked whether the problem might be that only 50 per cent could afford an @entity1 , mr @entity57 said : ' good question			2
our @entity102 is " great products " - we would never do something that is n't a great product , that 's not why we 're on this earth			0
' that said , if you look at what we 've done to appeal to people that are price sensitive — lower price of @entity109 , @entity116 , in most recent quarter , not enough supply of @entity109 - surprised us			0
' @entity5 has not unveiled another trailblazing product since mr @entity57 took over , raising concerns about whether the company is losing the ingenuity that has set it apart from the rest of the technology pack			0
analysts have said that the @entity128 firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important @entity38 market .			0

long - awaited budget @entity1 will cost just £ 220 ( $ 330 ) report on @entity29 site claims
it will be enclosed in a glossy polycarbonate plastic case , and could ship in a variety of colours
same report claims that successor to the @entity1 will have a larger screen
