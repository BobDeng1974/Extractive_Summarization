by @entity0 published : 17:44 est , 26 october 2012 updated : 17:44 est , 26 october 2012 concerns : former @entity3 chief @entity2 has said that many countries receiving aid from @entity6 can fend for themselves former @entity3 chief @entity2 has backed calls for @entity6 and the @entity9 to stop giving millions of pounds in aid to wealthy countries			1
he said booming nations such as @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 should wean themselves off development funding so it could be targeted at ‘ weaker ’ parts of the world instead			1
his comments come after international development secretary @entity19 called for the @entity9 to stop giving aid to relatively rich nations			1
she travelled to @entity21 last week to say it is wrong that the @entity9 ’s aid fund , to which the @entity6 contributes more than £ 1billion a year , sends money to relatively rich countries such as @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity6 refuses to fund such countries out of its own aid budget			1
however , the @entity6 is still sending around £ 280million a year to @entity14 – even though the country can afford its own space programme and its president , @entity33 , said in february : ‘ we do not require the aid			1
it is a peanut in our total development expenditure			0
’ conservative backbenchers want to see the @entity39 drop its pledge to increase spending on foreign aid year - on - year , while cutting funding in every other department apart from the @entity45			0
in 2014 , taxpayers will be forking out £ 12.6billion a year on foreign aid – more than the £ 12.1billion it will be spending on the police			0
mr @entity2 , a @entity50 who was the @entity3 secretary general from 1997 to 2006 , said not all the countries who received aid from @entity6 taxpayers needed it			1
‘ the emerging markets and the countries that are doing well should wean themselves off aid , ’ he said			0
‘ countries like @entity13 , @entity12 , @entity14 , @entity50 , @entity61 and @entity62 ; some of these countries can fend for themselves			1
' in fact i have had the chance to suggest to some of them that they should not accept @entity6 ’s aid willingly			1
they need to say “ we are full enough ” , so that there will be more money available for the really poor and weaker			0
’ a sixth of the money spent by the @entity76 goes to the @entity9 ’s aid programme			2
half of this £ 10billion budget is spent on middle and higher income countries , even though many say they are too wealthy to merit support			0
pledge : @entity19 headed to @entity21 this week to call for @entity9 funding to stop for richer countries @entity85 has committed £ 30million to numerous aid projects in @entity12 , which has almost 150 billionaires , and more than £ 10million to @entity13 , which will spend £ 9billion on its 2016 @entity88 and whose gdp overtook @entity6 ’s last year			1
but mr @entity2 , who quit his job as @entity92 peace envoy in august , also warned that governments rarely deliver all the aid they have promised			0
speaking at the @entity95 earlier this month , he added : ‘ the @entity96 and the @entity97 make lots of noise , lots of publicity about aid which is not in the end delivered			0
’ in recent weeks , it has emerged that @entity6 taxpayers ’ money has been splashed out on a string of projects in wealthy countries , while domestic cuts continue apace			2
among the projects being paid for by the @entity9 are a scheme promoting tourism in an @entity28 national park and a @entity117 television series in @entity118			0
and £ 1.8million has been handed to the @entity120 island of @entity27 to build a hotel and leisure complex where 200 young people will be trained each year in ‘ hospitality management ’			0
some £ 800,000 out of the @entity9 aid budget is going on a water park being built in @entity128 by the @entity130 owners of @entity131			2
at the @entity133 conference earlier this month , miss @entity19 said : ‘ i want to be clear that whether we give a pound directly , or through another organisation , i always expect value for money on behalf of the taxpayer			0
‘ i want to bring that same focus on value for money in the @entity6 to the @entity9 in @entity85			1
i do n’t think it ’s right that the @entity9 still gives money to those countries higher up the income scale , when we ’ve taken the decision to target the poorest			2
’ the @entity76 has spent £ 500million on so - called ‘ poverty barons ’ , private consultants running aid programmes abroad			0
meanwhile , millions in aid was last month pledged to help expand an oil plant in @entity14 part - owned by the @entity6 ’s richest man , billionaire steel magnate @entity153 .			2

he has even suggested to countries like @entity13 and @entity50 not to accept @entity6 *'s* aid
the calls come as development secretary @entity19 headed to @entity21 to urge @entity9 to stop giving aid
