energy and vitamin - enhanced drinks do not boost mental or physical health , a damning study has claimed			1
in fact , many of the benefits being claimed have no foundation in nutritional science either , said the report by university academics			1
the drinks boast of being packed with various nutrients and vitamins making claims to improve everything from concentration to improving mood			2
many of the health claims associated with these drinks have no foundation in nutritional science either , said the damning report by @entity24 academics but many young people get their daily intake of many of these vitamins in other ways , researchers told the journal @entity32			1
nutritional scientists from @entity24 's @entity34 and @entity35 , looked at the ingredients and claimed benefits of brands from local supermarkets			1
these included energy drinks , vitamin waters and juices with added nutrients , most commonly the vitamins @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity47 and niacin			1
but with the possible exception of vitamin c , most young adults are already getting their daily recommended levels of these nutrients anyway , said researcher @entity54			2
energy and vitamin - enriched drinks boast of being packed with various nutrients that may improve everything from concentration to mood she said : ' while our findings suggest that consumers stand to reap little or no benefit from the nutrient additions in novel beverages , most products were being marketed as if they provided a unique benefit to the consumer through the nutrient additions			0
' the brands are , typically , aimed at young adults claiming to give them renewed vigour and energy , help them to focus or revive them after a late night , for example			0
ms @entity54 said the ingredients of such drinks do not ' address existing nutrient inadequacies in the population '			0
the report said : ' labels ' highlighted nutritional attributes such as immune support and antioxidant properties , and some made claims related to specific nutrients			0
it added : ' in addition , nutrients were often juxtaposed with messages related to performance and emotional well - being , benefits that go beyond conventional nutritional science			2
' and ' young adults - the likely target group for these products - are already consuming enough of these nutrients to meet their needs			0
' the researchers said measures were needed to ' ensure that consumers of [ such ] beverages are not misled or exposed to unnecessarily high nutrient loads with no potential benefit			0

many of the benefits being claimed have no science behind them either
