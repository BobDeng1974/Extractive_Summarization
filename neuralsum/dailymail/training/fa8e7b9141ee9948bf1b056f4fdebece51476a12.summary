@entity0 could leave @entity1 facing higher mobile phone bills if they use their phone south of the border , the @entity5 will claim			2
ministers are to publish the latest in a series of papers examining the impact of a @entity11 vote in next year 's independence referendum			1
the paper will suggest independence could impact on mail services and costs , and could make programmes to roll out high speed broadband across the country more expensive			2
@entity1 may also have to pay international roaming charges if they make a mobile phone call south of the border people close to the border could also incur extra charges if their mobile phone is connected to a mast on the other side of the border it says mobile phone users may have to pay international roaming charges if they make a call in @entity34 , @entity35 or @entity36			1
it also warns that people close to the border could inadvertently incur these charges if their mobile phone connected to a mast on the other side of the border			2
@entity42 consumer minister @entity41 said : ' the @entity42 's integrated infrastructure connects people and communities , creates jobs and supports trade			2
' the government is committed to maintaining world class postal and broadband services			1
' this includes continuation of a six - day - a - week postal delivery service and the provision of broadband to rural areas			0
' the rural broadband programme will deliver investment of £ 100.8million to @entity1 communities that depend on getting connected			2
' if @entity1 left the @entity42 , posting a letter or making a call could cost more - and there could be less choice for customers			1
' the @entity42 government believes that by being in @entity42 @entity1 benefits from ' world class services and economies of scale ' that support the postal service , with its uniform pricing all over the @entity42 , and investment in broadband			1
the @entity74 - @entity73 coalition has allocated £ 530million over the spending review period for its rural broadband programme , designed to help roll out high speed internet services to more remote communities			0
@entity1 is to receive just over £ 100million of this , with the @entity42 government saying the country ' benefits disproportionately ' compared to its share of the population			1
but it warns that independence would mean @entity1 would no longer benefit from this , adding this would ' inevitably ' drive up the cost of delivering broadband in such areas			1
the @entity42 government also argues that if @entity1 left the @entity42 it could impact on the cost of sending letters and parcels between the two countries			1
at the moment , it says economies of scale across @entity42 help support six day a week postal deliveries , with customers paying one price to post something , regardless of where they are			0
the cost of posting letters and parcels could rise in an independent @entity1 , the government has warned communities minister @entity41 said there may be less choice for consumers in an independent @entity1 this is part of the @entity111 's universal service , with the @entity42 government saying the supporters of independence should set out if these levels of service would be maintained following a @entity11 vote			1
the @entity65 said successive @entity118 governments had ' substantially weakened ' @entity1 's communications infrastructure			0
a spokeswoman said : ' since 2002 , more than 400 @entity1 post offices have closed and plans for privatisation of @entity111 threatens jobs and the operation of the universal service obligation whilst people across rural @entity1 regularly struggle with the lack of mobile phone coverage as the current system fails to deliver for @entity1			0
' @entity0 will provide an opportunity to properly support the postal network with access to our fair share of @entity42 assets , and as the @entity137 have recognised , the @entity65 has an excellent record of supporting rural post offices			0
' both the @entity111 and the @entity137 are clear that there need be no disruption to services and that independence could offer real opportunities for the network			0
' similarly the @entity42 's claims fail to recognise key changes in the telecoms market			0
currently , the fragmentation of mobile and broadband initiatives , and the reserved nature of telecoms policy and regulation , prevents us from realising the economic benefits that could be achieved through improving digital connectivity - something highlighted in our proposals for future regulation published in february			0
' however the @entity5 should acknowledge that the @entity162 is looking to remove roaming charges completely and they are widely expected to be abolished well before 2016			1
' @entity0 could ensure that the regulatory and policy regimes are better aligned to achieve this			0
