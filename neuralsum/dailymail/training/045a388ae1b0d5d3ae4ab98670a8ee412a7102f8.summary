@entity0 has been told to ' stop banging on about the bedroom tax ' or face losing voters in the @entity4 ahead of the election @entity0 must stop ‘ banging on about the bedroom tax ’ or risk losing the election in the @entity4 , senior @entity7 figures have warned			1
candidates from key target seats across the @entity4 staged a revolt during a private meeting with mr @entity0 – telling him that @entity7 will lose unless it adopts a more ‘ aspirational ’ message			1
the warning came as the @entity7 leader was accused of reverting to class war with the release of a party political broadcast depicting the conservatives as bullying , out - of - touch toffs who have reduced @entity24 to a cowering figure			1
the campaign film , a parody of a 1950s b - movie , features actors playing @entity31 ministers with caricature posh voices			0
however it was quickly criticised as ‘ childish ’ after its release online last night			0
outside @entity37 , the opposition now has just 10 mps in the @entity4 , compared to more than 50 in @entity40 ’s landslide victory in 1997			2
many senior @entity7 figures believe the party can not win next year ’s election unless it tackles the perception that it only cares about its @entity46 heartlands			2
mr @entity0 invited 20 candidates from target seats in the @entity4 to a private meeting in @entity37 last month to discuss how the party could improve its performance			1
but instead of a general discussion about tactics and party machinery , the event quickly turned into a showdown over mr @entity0 ’s divisive left - wing agenda			2
a source at the meeting said candidates were in despair at the leadership ’s relentless anti-austerity message and urged him to change tack			0
‘ people were very clear that we have to start saying less about austerity and more about aspiration , ’ the source said			0
‘ we have got to stop banging on about the bedroom tax and the @entity70 because those messages are not going to win for us in the @entity4			1
i think he does get it , but it ’s just too easy for us to fall back into our comfort zone			0
’ last week one of mr @entity0 ’s closest allies warned publicly that @entity7 was in danger of losing the election in the @entity4			1
senior labour mp @entity98 , a former aide to mr @entity0 , said @entity7 was ‘ not on the agenda for most southern voters ’ , adding : ‘ we have got to do better because otherwise we will do worse			1

mr @entity0 yesterday appeared to accept the criticism but insisted that his focus on the cost of living would reap dividends in the @entity4			1
he said : ‘ mr @entity98 speaks a lot of sense about the challenges for @entity7 right across the @entity4			2
‘ but we have a very important message for people across the @entity4 – the cost of living crisis affects them too , particularly issues like rent levels			0
’ another shadow minister told the @entity121 that the economic recovery meant the party needed to broaden its message on the economy from the cost of living crisis			0
he added : ‘ if the election was tomorrow i ’d be quite confident			0
but it ’s not , so i ’m worried			0
’ @entity129 leader @entity128 also issued a coded warning to mr @entity0 not to focus solely on the party ’s core vote			2
