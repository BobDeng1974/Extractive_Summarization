by @entity0 published : 11:25 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 11:31 est , 6 february 2013 @entity2 's one and only effort at poetry as an adult has come to light more than 110 years after he put pen to paper			1
the wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter , prolific author and winner of the @entity11 for literature			1
yet despite being a lover of poetry , he was only known to have written verse once - and that was for a competition when he was at @entity17			1
now , a 40 - line poem - describing the eve of a naval battle - penned over two pages in blue crayon by @entity2 while he was in the @entity21 , has emerged for sale at auction in @entity24			1

it is now set for auction the poem is signed by @entity2 ( above ) and was written while he served in the 4th hussars , in about 1898 unsurprisingly , the poem is a rousing celebration of the @entity37 and of going to war to defend her			1
it is said to have been influenced by @entity41 and @entity42			1
it is signed by @entity2 and was written over two sides on the headed notepaper of his regiment , the 4th hussars , in about 1898			1
the first ten lines of the work , entitled @entity50 , read : the shadow falls along the shore the search lights twinkle on the sea the silence of a mighty fleet portends the tumult yet to be			1
the tables of the evening meal are spread amid the great machines and thus with pride the question runs among the sailors and marines breathes there the man who fears to die for @entity67 , home , & @entity69			2
the poem makes reference to obscure cities under the rule of the @entity37 like @entity74 in @entity76 - @entity75 in @entity77 and @entity78 in @entity79			2
it was most certainly written by the former prime minister before 1901 as there is a reference to @entity85 @entity84			1
it was acquired several years ago by @entity87 , a retired rare manuscript dealer from @entity89 in @entity90			2
mr @entity87 , 70 , said : ' this is the only poem in @entity2 's handwriting as an adult			2
' there is one at @entity17 but that was one he wrote as a boy and it was for a competition			1
' the archive at the @entity101 at @entity102 has never heard of another poem and that is a pretty certain statement			2
unsurprisingly , the poem is a rousing celebration of the @entity37 and of going to war to defend her			2
above , @entity2 in @entity110 in 1896 ' i do n't think it 's a bad effort , it is quite competent			1
it is quite rousing stuff and is an imperial celebratory poem that references cities that stretch across the @entity37			2
' it is interesting that nearly 50 years after the death of the most famous @entity67 of the 20th century , we are still discovering new aspects of his life			0
' at the time of writing the poem , @entity2 , who was also a talented artist , was an @entity21 war correspondent and had served in countries such as @entity125 and @entity126			0
he produced it before he fought in the second @entity128 a year later			0
@entity129 , the director of the @entity130 at @entity101 , @entity102 , said : ' of course he was a great writer and orator and he used poetry in some of his famous speeches			0
the wartime leader was a brilliant speechwriter , prolific author and winner of the @entity11 for literature ' he was someone who was greatly influenced by poetry and was able to memorise and recite large parts of other people 's poetry			0
' but it is rare to find a piece of poetry by him as an adult			0
i am not aware of any others that exist			0
' having read it , it seems to me that it was part - influenced by @entity41 and @entity42 and the sort of poems he would have read at school			0
' a spokesman for auctioneers @entity156 said : ' we do n't of course usually think of @entity2 as a poet but perhaps we should not be surprised to find that he wrote verse			0
' he was a man of many parts who , over the course of a long life , threw himself enthusiastically into a whole range of activities beyond his main calling as a politician and statesman			0
