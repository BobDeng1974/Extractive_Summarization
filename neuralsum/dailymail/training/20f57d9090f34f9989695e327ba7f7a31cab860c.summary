@entity1 sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior , but it looks like it may have paid off for once			0
after much public outrage from @entity7 fans when their beloved @entity9 cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year , the team has decided to bring back the ladies once regular season play begins			1
anything to calm those @entity20 fanatics			0
there was also a video of the girls that accompanied the big announcement , which led to much cheering from the crowd according to @entity36			0
fans learned the @entity9 were no longer when the @entity7 took on the @entity38 at the @entity39 in their first pre-season game of the year , and a group of men , and not women , hit the ice to do some cleaning			1
the boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen , who , unlike their predecessors , got to wear pants and a fleece , went to work on the ice			2
temporary leave : it is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year there is still no word yet on just why the @entity9 were replaced , but one of the group 's members , @entity62 , did break the news on her @entity64 this august that they would not return to the rink			1
' no # flyersicegirls this year , but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @ @entity71 & to all # @entity37 for being awesome , ' she wrote			0
the girls will now be back though , taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff - baring top , hot pants , leg warmers and their skates , not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees			1
the @entity7 also play an outdoor classic every year , where the temperature is about 20 degrees			0
strict rules : the girls are asked to never fraternize with any of the hockey players and ca n't eat while in costume @entity89 wrote an article about the ice girls last year , and the all - female cleaning crew for another hockey team , the @entity93 , highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too			2
among other things , the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes , being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in			0
this negative coverage could be why the @entity9 were temporarily replaced by the new all - male cleaning crew .			1

@entity7 fans got very angry earlier this month when they learned the team had replaced the @entity9 with an all - male cleaning crew
the @entity9 were a group of women who cleaned the ice during games wearing hot pants , midriff - baring tops , and leg warmers
now , after much outrage , the team has announced the @entity9 will return once the regular season begins
