by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:38 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:41 est , 20 december 2013 death : @entity4 , who ingested a small but lethal amount of heroin at his home in @entity8 a toddler killed when he took a fatal heroin overdose in the house where he lived with his drug - addicted parents was failed by social services , according to a report			1
in may last year , 23 - month - old @entity4 ingested a tiny but lethal amount of heroin at the family ’s home in @entity8			1
a serious case review published today concluded those tasked with looking out for the toddler failed to properly assess the risk of harm presented to him by his parent ’s habitual drug use			1
if care workers , doctors and health professionals had been more ‘ professionally curious ’ , had more ‘ respectful uncertainty ’ and been ‘ more assertive ’ in their approach to the family , @entity4 ’s death may have been avoidable , it concluded			1
the report stated there had been ‘ a number of missed opportunities ’ to intervene in the boy ’s care by the different agencies involved			1
however , it also acknowledged there had been ‘ examples of good inter-agency working ’			0
the report ’s authors also said despite the parents ’ long - standing drug addiction , none of the care workers involved in the case foresaw the risk that @entity4 might be exposed to heroin , or other substances			1
earlier this year , @entity4 ’s father @entity55 , 30 , was jailed for six years after admitting the boy ’s manslaughter			1
his mother @entity58 , 34 , received four years after pleading guilty to allowing the toddler ’s death			1
@entity4 fully accepted culpability for his son ’s death , admitting he had been taking heroin when his son fell ill. @entity58 was drug - tested following her arrest and found to be clear of the drug			1
at their sentencing hearing in july this year , judge @entity68 told the couple it was beyond doubt they had loved their little boy but , she added : ‘ you failed woefully to protect him from the very obvious dangers you exposed him to			2
‘ the danger was mortal danger , as you should have realised , ’ she said			0
following the death , @entity80 immediately launched a serious case review - carried out whenever a child has died and abuse or neglect is suspected to have been a factor			0
the board ’s chairman @entity87 said : ‘ what comes across very strongly from this serious case review is that practitioners who worked with @entity4 and his family should have looked beyond his apparent well - being and understood what life was like from his perspective			2
‘ that they failed to do this is clearly unacceptable , and we have a duty to @entity4 to ensure that , as far as is possible , the same thing does n’t happen again			2
’ he added many parents , who had drug addictions , coped with being parents			2
the report has put forward 44 recommendations , which have now either been acted upon or are being implemented , relating to better support for frontline staff , improvement to working practices and particularly assessments of the risk harm to a child , and also better inter-agency communication			0
addiction : @entity4 's father @entity55 , 30 and @entity58 , 34 , pictured with their son at their @entity8 home			1
they both used drugs in the house both @entity4 - who had served time in jail for robbery and @entity58 , 34 , were known to the addiction services team which at the time was run by the @entity128 prior to @entity4 ’s birth			1
there was a history of domestic trouble between the couple , with @entity58 , a heavy drinker , on a prescription for methadone , having been a heroin addict for 12 years			2
when she became pregnant with @entity4 , they were referred to @entity141 ’s children ’s services , and following his birth his development was monitored by health visitors from the @entity145			2
the report found that ' @entity4 died as a result of an event that had not been foreseen by any of the professionals involved with the family ' but concluded a more assertive approach by care workers might have made all the difference			1
findings : had social services been more ' professionally curious ' and been ' more assertive ' in their approach to the family , @entity4 's death may have been avoidable , a report today concluded it acknowledged the parents had not always been co-operative , but concluded this had made follow - up work all the more important			1
however , the report set out the frequent examples where it found those checks were simply not carried out , or followed through on			0
there were 11 multi-agency child in @entity168 meetings between the parents and care and health workers			0
but the report ’s authors said the action plans developing out of these meetings were ' not robust and did not sufficiently address the risks to @entity4 of his parents ’ substance use			2
' ‘ there do not appear to have been any significant changes effected by the child in @entity168 plan over the almost two years that it had been in place			0
’ @entity58 , suffering constant pain and disability from a severe accident prior to the birth of her son , was getting medication from her gp but also topped up the methadone she was prescribed by taking heroin , she said , to cope with her on - going discomfort			2
the report said : ‘ unfortunately there was no collaborative working between the gp practice and the addiction service , which may have better addressed her pain and reduced her need for illicit drugs			0
’ board chairman mr @entity87 said the parents ’ drug - use meant their ‘ capacity to meet his needs was compromised ’ , adding different care and health workers had ‘ failed to fully understand the potential impact of their drug use on @entity4 ’			1
‘ their focus was too much on the parents , and not enough on their son and the family unit as a whole			0
‘ their assessments depended on the parents ’ co-operation and candour , and this was not always forthcoming			0
‘ had the practitioners challenged them properly , they may have appreciated the full extent of the potential risks that @entity4 faced			0
’ mr @entity87 added : ‘ it is important to stress that things do change as a result of tragedies like this			0
already , we ’ve seen a number of improvements			0
’ he said the board would be monitoring the implementation of its recommendations			0
aware : both @entity4 , who had served time in jail for robbery and @entity58 , both pictured , were known to the local addiction services team prior to @entity4 's birth a spokesman for the @entity249 @entity248 trust said : ‘ although the trust does not provide these addiction services any more , during the 10 months following @entity4 ’s death , we took action to improve the way the service supported the whole family and took into account the impact that substance misuse has upon a child			1
‘ these improvements were transferred over to the new provider when the service was decommissioned in april 2013			0
’ the @entity266 , in a statement , said : ‘ patient safety is of paramount importance to us so we will take the review ’s findings on board and learn any lessons we can in terms of safeguarding children			0
’ @entity276 , @entity8 council assistant children ’s services director , said it was ‘ very clear that more could and should have been done by the agencies who worked with @entity4 and his family , including the council ’			1
he added : ‘ if the parents are deemed capable of looking after their child , they must be given , and be seen to act upon , clear advice about ensuring their children remain @entity290 did n’t happen in this instance			0
’ he added the council had fully accepted all the recommendations , had implemented changes , and was ‘ determined to do all we can to help prevent a similar tragedy from happening again ’			0
‘ once again , i ’d like to offer our sympathies to @entity4 ’s family and reassure them that , through the changes we and our partner agencies are making , we will be doing all we can to keep our children and young people safer in the future			1
