by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:04 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 14 february 2013 speaking out : sir @entity2 yesterday accused the government of scoring an embarrassing ' own goal ' by pushing up inflation through green taxes and tuition fees sir @entity2 yesterday accused the government of scoring an embarrassing ‘ own goal ’ by pushing up inflation through green taxes and tuition fees			1
the governor of the @entity13 warned that the unprecedented squeeze on living standards will last for a further three years as prices rise and wages stagnate			1
but , in a coded attack on ministers , he said much of the pain was ‘ self - inflicted ’ because it stemmed from big increases in energy bills and tuition fees			2
‘ whether it ’s on financing education , green policies or other policies , what they have done is push up prices and that clearly makes our job in the short - run more difficult , ’ sir @entity2 said			1
the average household energy bill is now more than £ 1,300 a year and has risen nearly 25 per cent since early 2011 , with suppliers blaming green levies imposed by the government			0
rail fares , which are regulated by the government , have also soared and university tuition fees are now as much as £ 9,000 a year			0
speaking at the @entity13 ’s quarterly inflation report yesterday , sir @entity2 said there was ‘ cause for optimism in the @entity47 ’ but added that economic growth is ‘ likely to be weak ’ in the coming months			1
he also said the level of economic output is not expected to return to its pre-recession peak in 2008 until 2015 – marking a seven - year downturn			0
and with inflation expected to remain above 2 per cent until early 2016 there could be three more years of squeezed living standards			1
even in 2016 , there is a ‘ 50 - 50 chance ’ inflation would stay above target			2
senior figures in @entity61 expressed amazement that the governor had spoken out so vociferously against @entity41 policies			0
former @entity66 spokesman @entity65 said : ‘ the governor is basically blaming the chancellor for pushing up prices			0
’ not happy : the governor of the @entity13 believes inflation has been pushed up by the introduction of tuition fees			0
this is a file picture of graduates bank critics , however , accused sir @entity2 and the @entity76 of ‘ an abdication of responsibility ’ for allowing inflation to spiral above the 2 per cent target for so long			1
it was last below target in november 2009			0
@entity83 , a @entity84 member of the @entity85 , said : ‘ this is a quite extraordinary intervention			0
it is the @entity13 ’s job , when setting interest rates , to hit a 2 per cent inflation target , to take account of precisely items like tuition fees and green taxes			0
it ’s fundamental to the @entity76 forecast			0
’ sir @entity2 ’s dramatic intervention came just months before he hands over the reins to @entity99 , the @entity100 , in july			1
‘ the @entity47 economy is set for a recovery , ’ said sir @entity2			1
surprised : @entity83 , a @entity84 member of the @entity85 , said sir @entity2 's comments were a ' quite extraordinary intervention ' ‘ that is not to say the road ahead will be smooth			1
this has n’t been a normal recession and it wo n’t be a normal recovery			0
’ the report forecast inflation to rise from its current level of 2.7 per cent to above 3 per cent in the coming months , eating into household budgets			1
sir @entity2 said tuition fees , rail fares and utility bills added around one percentage point to inflation at the end of last year and will do so throughout 2013 and 2014			1
‘ it ’s a bit of an own goal because it looks as if inflation is worse without any change in the underlying economy , ’ he said			2
‘ it is a bit of a self - inflicted goal in terms of the damage done to real take - home pay			0
’ the inflation report warned that the higher cost of education would add 0.3 percentage points to inflation in 2013 and again in 2014			0
electricity and gas bills are expected to add 0.3 percentage points while other ‘ regulated and administrative ’ prices , including rail fares , water , and taxes on air travel , alcohol , tobacco and fuel , would add 0.4 percentage points			2
the governor said the increase in these prices made ‘ the challenge of bringing inflation back to 2 per cent more difficult ’			2
but he warned that raising interest rates to curb rising prices ‘ would risk derailing the recovery ’			2
a @entity66 spokesman said : ‘ @entity41 has taken continued action to help with the cost of living , by freezing fuel duty for more than two years and also taking action to freeze council tax			1

sir @entity2 said squeeze on living standards will last for another three years
he said there was ‘ cause for optimism in the @entity47 ’
but he added that economic growth is ‘ likely to be weak ’ in coming months
