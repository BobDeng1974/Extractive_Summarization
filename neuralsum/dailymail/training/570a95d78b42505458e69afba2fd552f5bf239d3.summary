@entity7 , now 83 , was an unmarried 19 year - old when she gave birth to baby @entity9 ( now @entity10 , 65 ) in december 1948			1
the little girl - who was her only child - was adopted by a couple who lived seven miles away from her mother in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , and educated at nearby @entity17			1
@entity7 with daughter @entity18 , who she has recently been reunited with after giving her up for adoption at birth an amazing coincidence saw @entity7 ( left , 83 ) and @entity9 ( right , 65 ) ride the same bus every day for seven years while @entity9 was at school , with neither knowing of their connection each day young @entity9 caught the same bus to get to school - and @entity7 was the conductor			1
mother and daughter were within feet of each other on a daily basis for seven years without either knowing who the other was			2
they only realised how close they had been when mother - of - two @entity9 finally tracked down @entity7 in 2005			1
widowed @entity7 said : ' it ’s unbelievable to think that we were so close to each other for all the years @entity9 was at school			1
' i do n’t think i would have said anything even if i had known because i had to wait for @entity9 to make the first move			2
' it ’s nice to think that i was a part of her life when she was younger when i thought i was n’t			0
@entity9 , pictured as a school girl , rode the same bus as her birth mother through - out her childhood ' my husband @entity49 and i could n’t have children , and that ’s the only thing i regret is not having a family			1
' but now i have a big family - @entity9 has two children and grandchildren so now i ’m a great - grandma			1
@entity7 , pictured here in her bus conductor uniform , had @entity9 when she was just 19 years old ' it ’s marvellous , i ’m very happy at how it ’s all turned out			1
' @entity7 worked as a bus conductor between 1945 and 1982 and regularly worked with her late husband @entity49 who was a bus driver			1
she added : ' i worked on the school buses which ran to @entity63 every day			1
' @entity49 drove the bus			1
we both could have seen @entity9 every day for all those years - it ’s incredible			1
' @entity7 , who lives in @entity67 , @entity16 , was found by @entity9 in december 2005			1
@entity9 had been adopted age five by @entity69 and @entity70 , and went on to train as a teacher before marrying in 1970 , aged 21 , and having two children			1
she subsequently divorced and has since remarried			0
@entity9 was living in @entity73 , @entity74 , with her children @entity76 and @entity77 and it was @entity76 who found @entity7 ’s brother @entity80 online			1
@entity9 got in touch with a letter which said : ' before you start reading this letter , i suggest that you make yourself a cup of tea , and sit down in your best comfy chair			2
@entity7 's late husband @entity90 worked with her on the bus			1
the couple were unable to have children of their own @entity97 bus station where @entity7 worked on the buses between 1945 and 1982 ' no , it ’s not bad news , but it is information that may shock and surprise you and be emotional for you			1
' my name is @entity104 , born on 05/12/1948			0
my birth was registered on 06/01/1949 in @entity97 , and i believe that you are my mum			2
' i was adopted by @entity69 and @entity107 when i was aged five			2
' i have always known that i was adopted			0
' i do n’t really know why you were unable to look after me , but whatever the reason , i believe you did what you thought was best , or had to do , at that time			0
' i do not blame you , i am not angry with you , and i have always understood that it must have been a difficult and emotional choice that you had to make			0
' however , i realise that this letter , coming like a bolt from the blue , must be a terrific shock to you , and understand that you may not want to see me at all , and for all sorts of reasons			0
' @entity7 said : ' as soon as i read the letter i picked up the phone and rang @entity9			1
' it was so strange hearing my daughter ’s voice			0
after all , i never knew what she sounded like before			0
' speaking today @entity9 said : ' my mum asked me if i went to @entity17 and said " did you used to get the school bus ? " ' i replied ' yes , twice a day ' to which mum said ' i was the bus conductor '			1
' i had absolutely no idea that the lady who checked my bus pass twice a day was my mum			2
' it was a complete shock when we began talking about our past and my school life , and that was mentioned			0
' she added : ' my adopted brother had found his family and i thought it was about time i found mine			2
my daughter had found a missing persons ' website and uploaded information up of who i was			0
' i tried to find her myself but got absolutely nowhere			0
' however , my daughter amazingly got a response from someone who looked up family ancestry as a hobby			0
' i used 192.com to trace a number for the name i had , and the nerves i had were unbelieveable			0
i can remember feeling anxious , sick , not knowing if my mum would pick up			0
the letter @entity9 wrote to @entity7 in 2005 , telling her she was her daughter ' i asked " is it @entity7 ? " , she replied ' yes , is this @entity9 ? ' and i said " oh hello mum ! "			1
' we phone each other when we can and go up to see her as much as i can			0
it has been amazing to spend the lost birthdays and @entity160 together			0
' i do n't remember anything about the bus conductor , and all along it was my mum			1
it 's incredible how we 've been able to find each other			0
' @entity9 ’s father was a @entity167 exile who married another woman after a brief relationship with @entity7			1
@entity7 recalled : ' i was 19 at the time and i did n’t know where babies came from			1
' one night i got this pain in my tummy			0
i thought babies had to be cut out of you but all of a sudden this baby dropped out			0
' my mum was in the next bedroom and i went to her and said ‘ mum , i think i ’ve had a baby ’			0
' i named her @entity9 because it was around christmas time when she was born and i thought it was appropriate			2
' @entity9 was a month or so premature so she had to stay at the hospital for a while			2
' every saturday i would go up to see her and i was allowed one day visit when i brought her home , but the decision was made that she would be adopted			2
' i knew that it was what had to happen , so although i wished i could keep her , i knew there was nothing i could do			0
' over the years i always thought about her , where she was living , whether she worked , whether she was married			2
' i would have loved to see her but did n’t know how to get in touch			0
' now it ’s lovely to be in contact again			0
' @entity9 works so she ca n’t come and see me as much as she ’d like , but we speak on the phone every few days and she comes to see me often			2
