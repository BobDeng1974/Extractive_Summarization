@entity1 's poor leadership has been mocked by a @entity3 candidate , who said it was like having ' a manager of a football team that you do n't rate , but you still support the team '			1
@entity10 even joked that he hoped his ' off - piste ' comment would not ' find it 's way back ' to the @entity3 leadership , because he stands little hope of winning in @entity15 , @entity16			1
he also blasted @entity3 's ' entirely unsatisfactory ' policy on tuition fees and told voters at a university hustings : ' i do n't like where we are			1
but mr @entity10 felt no such reservations as he appeared at a hustings event with four other candidates			1
the 52 - year - old lawyer was asked for his comments on higher eduction funding by a member of the audience at the packed event at the @entity43			2
he said : ' if i can go off - piste a little , as somebody who has a very realistic idea of what the maths will be in this constituency , maybe what i say is n't going to find it 's way back to mr @entity1 and his friends			1
' he added : ' now one of the things which has brought me to politics at this very late stage you might think is the wish to make a difference			0
now i am a @entity3 man and i will stand by my party , thick and thin			2
' it 's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you do n't rate , but you still support the team , sometimes			2
' what we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best , and from my point of view you 're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it			0
' to laughter from the audience , he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his ' glowing endorsement ' for @entity3 's leader			2
@entity1 , pictured giving a speech in @entity86 today , has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 if he is elected on may 7 @entity1 has revealed his childhood dream was to become a @entity90 bus conductor			1
the @entity3 leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old - style vehicles had made him want the job			2
mr @entity1 made the admission during a visit to @entity86 , where he was asked by a young boy in the audience , @entity99 , what he wanted to be when he was seven years old			1
he replied : ' i wanted to be a bus conductor			0
i tell you why , because on the @entity90 buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine			0
i was particularly fascinated by that			0
' mr @entity1 is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses			1
conservative former prime minister sir @entity111 once failed a test to become a bus conductor			0
the seat of @entity15 is held by the @entity116 @entity115 , who secured a majority of 4,920 over the conservatives in 2010			1
but the constituency is seen as crucial to @entity121 hopes of winning an overall majority in the @entity123			2
however , five years ago @entity3 secured just 5 per cent of the vote			0
mr @entity1 has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 if he is elected on may 7			1
critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates , because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime			0
but mr @entity10 appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree			1
he said : ' you know that in the @entity3 manifesto the fees will come down to £ 6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory			1
' he added : ' but it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20 , and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier			0
' i find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well			0
we have choices for all sorts of things , but we choose to spend the money on other things , and i wish we did n't , i wish we really did n't			0
' he finished his criticism of his party by adding : ' i do n't like where we are , i wish it was different , but i hope we can see it differently going forward			0

@entity10 jokes he hopes ' off - piste ' remark will not get back to @entity1
labour candidate in @entity15 also blasts party 's policy on tuition fees
says @entity1 *vow* to cut from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 is ' entirely unsatisfactory '
