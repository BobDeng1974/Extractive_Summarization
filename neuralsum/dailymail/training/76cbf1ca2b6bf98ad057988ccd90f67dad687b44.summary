a flood of aggressive ' demon shrimp ' could wipe out native species in @entity3 as they spread through waterways across the country			1
the shrimp , which kill and eat indigenous breeds , come from eastern @entity8 are thought to have been carried here in pools of water aboard large ships			1
experts have warned of the ' major threat ' which the animals , just 1cm long , present to native ecosystems			2
aggressive : the so - called demon shrimp could wipe out stocks of native shrimp in some @entity3 waterways some scientists have warned that the shrimp could also spread diseases that could ravage other waterlife and change the character of entire ecosystems			1
an @entity28 spokesman said : ' invasive shrimp such as this species present a major threat to the ecology of our rivers and lakes			2
we have a real battle on our hands to control their spread			0
' these demon shrimp have been introduced into lakes in east @entity8 as fish food but they eat nearly anything			1
' it 's difficult to say exactly what the long term financial impact would be but , for example , they do eat mayflies and that will impact fly fishing			0
' we also classify rivers by ecological status and these shrimp could alter a river 's status - meaning we could have to invest money restoring ecosystems			2
' dr @entity60 , a marine scientist from the @entity61 , is investigating alongside the agency , and warned of the potential for ' demon parasites ' clinging to the shrimps ' bodies to damage @entity3 ecosystems			1
predatory : the shrimp kill and eat their native equivalents , and could also carry fatal parasites dr @entity60 , from the university 's @entity74 , said : ' they are out - eating and out - competing our native shrimp and changing the species dynamic in our rivers and lakes			1
' as soon as one species is depleted , it can affect the whole food chain with potentially catastrophic results			0
' one of the main reasons why invasive species are successful is the escape from predators , parasites and disease in their native habitats			1
' we are looking at whether these demon shrimp carry ' demon parasites ' , which could also affect our native species that wo n't have any immunity			1
' there is a very real bio-security threat of spreading disease and parasites in native populations without acquired resistance			2
' @entity104 shrimp can be found living underneath stones in rivers and have been replacing and mating with other amphipods			0
it 's not the first time a new species has taken over @entity3 waters			0
@entity112 were introduced in the 1970s and have since eaten their way through @entity3 waterways - feasting on plants , invertebrates and small fish			0
the six - inch long crayfish , which live for up to 12 years , carry a fungus which kills native crayfish , a protected species			0
as a result , the @entity28 has ruled that all non-native crayfish caught in @entity3 waters are to be destroyed .			0

the species , from eastern @entity8 , are known to kill and eat native shrimp
they are thought to have arrived in *ballast* water aboard large ships
*environment* agency warns that they can *disrupt* ecosystems
one scientists also spoke of ' demon parasites ' which could kill *wildlife*
