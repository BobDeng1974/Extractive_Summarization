the cover of the magenta card features a snap of the royal couple standing on the balcony of the @entity14 in @entity15 with a crowd of well - wishers below			1
inside , there is a family photo , with the couple joined by their two daughters , eight - year - old @entity23 and seven - year - old @entity24			1
' we hope that the excitement , the hope , and the goodwill of @entity5 remain beyond these days of celebration			0
' princess @entity23 , who will one day be @entity2 of @entity8 , signed the card with her official title , @entity41 - the designation once held by her father			1
since taking the throne last june , @entity44 has been taking his new role extremely seriously , attending official events several times a week			0
earlier this week , @entity1 , 42 , and @entity44 , 46 , attended a function held to honour members of the @entity50 - the @entity8 cinema association			2
this is not the first time the @entity8 royals , who are currently in mourning for the late queen @entity54 , have shown their support for the arts in recent months			0
greetings : the front features a snap of the royal couple on the balcony of the @entity14 in @entity15 @entity1 in particular is known to be a fan and travelled to @entity63 at the beginning of october to open an exhibition dedicated to @entity8 court painter , @entity66			1
later the same week , she and @entity44 were both on hand for the launch of a new @entity8 dictionary and have consistently championed the arts since ascending to the throne in june			0
the two have also overseen a sea - change in the way the @entity8 royal family does business , with @entity44 banning private employment and accepting lavish gifts last week			2
the new rules , which also apply to former @entity81 and his wife @entity82 , come into effect on @entity84 and are intended to avoid ' compromising the dignity of the institution '			0
@entity44 's move comes after his father 's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an € 18m ( £ 14m ) yacht			1
royal duties : @entity1 , 42 , and @entity44 , 46 , attend an event held to honour the @entity8 cinema association @entity98 , which @entity81 was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity , became a regular plaything of the @entity8 royals , who used it during summer holidays in @entity104			2
@entity44 's new - look @entity8 monarchy is closer in style to the @entity108 system , which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles			2
as part of his drive to modernise the institution , the 46 - year - old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an ' exemplary manner ' likely to ' earn citizens ' appreciation , respect and trust			1
' despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their @entity133 and @entity8 counterparts , the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 monarchs and their families do accept gifts , although like the @entity133 royals , most have to be declared			0
