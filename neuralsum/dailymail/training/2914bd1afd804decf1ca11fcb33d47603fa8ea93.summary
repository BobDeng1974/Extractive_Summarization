getting supplies to astronauts on the @entity2 can be a long , costly process and , unfortunately , @entity4 does n't deliver to outer space			1
however , this week , thanks to made in @entity10 's @entity9 , astronaut @entity8 got a ratcheting socket wrench he needed uplinked -- or transmitted -- to him in space , @entity7 reports			1
since its launch in september , the 3 - d printer has made a total of 21 objects aboard the @entity2 , according to @entity19 , those objects had previously been tested on the printer with back - up files created			1
unlike the 21 objects printed before it , the wrench 's design did not exist when the printer was first launched			2
the wrench took four hours to print and the entire process took less than a week , @entity7 reports			2
the tool has rounded edges and finger grooves to make it ' more ergonomic and improve the grip , ' according to @entity29			0
the wrench will be returned to @entity46 , along with other @entity48 printed parts , for observation and testing			2
installed : astronaut @entity8 initially installed the @entity26 printer and recently received the wrench he needed from the @entity26 printer the 3 - d printer is the first to operate in zero gravity , according to @entity7 , and printed its first object in november			1
the object was a part for the printer			0
in a news release , @entity60 , @entity61 's @entity26 print manager , said the printer will be ' critical for exploration missions			0
' ' this means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish , ' @entity60 said			2
' the on - demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today ... ' the printer will decrease cost , decrease risk , and increase efficiency , according to the news release			0
the process of printing an object can take anywhere from 15 minutes to hours , depending on its size and complexity			0
zero - gravity : photographed is the @entity86 printer , created by @entity87 , and launched in september manufacture : the printer receives a hardware code and can immediately begin manufacturing an object the process of uplinking objects to the @entity2 includes designing the objects hardware , converting that hardware into a file - format the @entity26 printer can read , sending the file to @entity61 , and , finally , transmitting the file to the @entity2 the zero - gravity printer then receives the code and can begin manufacturing the object immediately			1
this new , innovative technology is a big step for space exploration			0
normally , astronauts would wait anywhere between weeks and months for objects they needed in space			0
but now , thanks to the zero - gravity printer , astronauts no longer need to wait .			1

a zero - gravity 3 - d printer manufactured a socket wrench in the @entity2
the printer is the first of its kind and produced the wrench in less than a week
other objects were previously printed in outer space , but the wrench was the first to be designed , tested , and printed to the @entity2 without previous testing
