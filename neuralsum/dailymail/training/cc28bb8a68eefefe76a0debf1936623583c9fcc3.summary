by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 is facing a lengthy ban after the @entity5 striker bit @entity7 defender @entity6 on the shoulder in @entity11 ’s 1 - 0 @entity10 victory on monday			1
for the third time in his troubled career , the 27 - year - old has been caught on camera sinking his teeth into an opponent			0
incredibly , the controversial striker attempted to explain the outrageous incident by saying : ‘ these things happen in the box			0
we were in contact , chest against shoulder and i got a knock in the eye			0
’ video : scroll down to see moment @entity2 bit @entity6 chomping at the bit : @entity2 appears bites @entity6 during @entity11 's 1 - 0 win ouch : @entity6 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity33 @entity34 declared : ‘ @entity2 is a sneak and he gets away with it because @entity37 want their stars to play in the @entity10			1
i ’d love to see ifthey have the courage to use video evidence against him			0
‘ the referee saw the bite mark , too , but he did nothing about it			1
’ @entity37 have indicated they will investigate today after @entity46 referee @entity33 did not see the incident			1
the world governing body will no doubt look unkindly on @entity2 , given his long history of disciplinary issues			1
they have the power to ban any player for as long as two years if they see fit			1
it is more likely that @entity2 will receive a much shorter retrospective ban that could still end his tournament after monday ’s victory saw @entity11 advance to the last 16 at @entity62 ’s expense			1
hot water : @entity2 clutches his teeth after appearing to sink them into @entity6 's shoulder bite marks : @entity6 shows his wounds to the ref after a clash with @entity2 no action : @entity6 appeals to referee @entity33 after the incident images of defender @entity6 ’s shoulder clearly showed teeth marks after the @entity7 pulled down his shirt to display the evidence after the incident			1
@entity2 , though , walked through the interview area smiling after the game and refused to answer questions			1
earlier in a bad - tempered match , @entity7 midfielder @entity81 had been sent off for a stamp at @entity84			0
@entity6 added : ‘ the disparity in judgment has been evident			1
@entity81 ’s sending - off was ridiculous but more so the fact that @entity2 was n’t sent off			2
‘ there ’s the will to protect champions but the referee should have shown him a red card			0
’ @entity7 coach @entity94 resigned after @entity62 ’s exit , while his opposite number @entity97 refused to accept that @entity2 had done anything wrong			2
undeserved ? @entity99 scored seconds later to send @entity11 through to the @entity100 @entity11 defender @entity101 said : ‘ i did n’t see anything			1
did you see it here or did you see what happened in other years ? ‘ you could n’t have seen it here because nothing happened			0
the worst of everything is the attitude of @entity6			2
he ’s a great player with an enormous status but this does n’t correspond with @entity7 football			0
as sportsmen leaving the field , crying and appealing against a rival , it ’s not good			0
as a man he disappointed me totally			0
’ the longest ban in @entity10 history was eight games for @entity62 ’s @entity124 after he broke the nose of @entity127 ’s @entity126 in 1994			0
@entity37 vice-president @entity128 said last night : ‘ i have watched the incident several times on television			2
there is no doubt @entity2 is a fantastic footballer but , once again , his actions have left him open to severe criticism			2
@entity37 must investigate the incident			0

@entity2 facing lengthy ban after appearing to bite @entity6
minutes later @entity11 score to send them through to @entity141
@entity6 showed bite marks to referee who took no action
defender labels @entity2 a ' sneak ' who @entity37 wo *n't* *punish* because he is a star player
@entity2 has been banned twice before because of biting opponents
