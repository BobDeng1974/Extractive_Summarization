by @entity0 a mobile phone charger that can be powered by either a cold beer or a hot coffee has been unveiled			2
the @entity4 , which doubles as a drinks coaster , connects to a phone with a usb cable			2
it has two sides , one red , one blue			2
the engine is designed so that the working gas is compressed in the colder portion of the engine and expanded in the hotter portion to convert heat into energy			1
owners use the red side as a drinks coaster to place a hot drink on it , and the blue side as for a cooling drink such as a beer			0
it uses something called a @entity15 engine to turn heat into @entity40 company @entity39 , based in @entity41 , @entity42 , has built a working prototype and hopes to have it on the market early in 2014			1
the company is still vague on just how long it takes for the device to charge up a phone because there are a lot of variables at play , including how hot or cold the source is			0
any source of heat that can fit on the @entity56 will work			1
it works best with something that 's very warm like a steaming cup of tea or coffee or very cold like a well chilled beer or soft drink			0
@entity4 is aiming to raise £ 63,000 on fund raising website @entity64 to turn the prototype into a gadget that can be mass - manufactured			1
by feb 8 , more than £ 25,000 ( pounds ) had been raised , and early birds can still get in for a £ 62 pledge price			0
the regular pledge for a @entity56 will be £ 73			0
@entity70 of @entity4 said : ' we called it @entity56 because of its shape			0
the blue side can be used as a coaster for a cooling drink such as a beer ' we added " @entity79 not only to imply that it is the one solution to this problem , but also to go with our ongoing theme that @entity4 has one vision for @entity84 that we all share			0
' @entity86 is a neat gizmo for cell phone users , but the implications of this project are much farther reaching than just cell phones			0
' once we have this project off the ground , we 'll get to work on larger scale versions of the @entity86 that will provide inexpensive power to households and villages using nothing but waste heat as the energy input			1
' there 's nothing new about the idea of using @entity15 engines to do that , but no one has ever successfully brought them to market in an affordable package			1
' any source of heat that can fit on the @entity56 will work , although the firm says it works best with something that 's very warm like a steaming cup of tea or coffee the gadget is simply flipped over to use the ' cold ' side to create energy when needed			1

uses a @entity15 engine to turn heat into energy
firm hopes to create larger versions to power *remote* villages
