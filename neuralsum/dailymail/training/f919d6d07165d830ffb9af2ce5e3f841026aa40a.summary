long may this continue : here we are , heading into @entity1 , and the 20 men who started the season as @entity5 managers all retain their jobs			1
if it was down to me , they would all still be in their roles on may 24 next year , when the campaign reaches its conclusion			0
i ’d certainly back a rule being brought in that prevented clubs sacking their manager during a season , as there are so many implications from one decision			1
@entity19 came under fire earlier this season and was favourite to be the first boss sacked in the top flight @entity24 have won six of their last nine games , including victory over previously unbeaten @entity28 think about the negative domino effect that is created : if one club is performing poorly and sacks its manager , that means another club will lose their manager through no fault of their own			1
they , in turn , then have no option but to try to lure someone else away ... and on it goes			0
why should owners and chairman be able to do that ? if the man they started out with in august is n’t delivering , they should n’t be allowed to correct their own mistake by inflicting huge change elsewhere : they make the appointments , so they should live with the consequences			2
how long this stability continues is anyone ’s guess , given that there is a lot of scrutiny on some managers , but it is looking like this will be the first season since the opening @entity5 campaign in 1992 - 93 that no managerial changes will have taken place before @entity1			1
what i have found fascinating this year is how some managers , who were seemingly walking a tightrope not so long ago when they were in the middle of bad runs , are now being hailed for doing ‘ brilliant ’ jobs			1
use @entity19 as an example			0
the outsiders ’ perception is that he will have changed his methods to generate @entity24 ’s improvement but the reality will be different			2
new signings , like @entity77 , have settled , while @entity78 is showing the form he did when first arriving here			0
@entity80 is another case in point			2
@entity84 ’s owners wanted him to play more attacking football and it looks like that is what he has given them			2
has @entity80 , with more than 20 years ’ coaching experience , completely altered his approach in one summer ? @entity80 also came under fire early in the season after an underwhelming start by @entity84 yet signings like @entity95 ( front ) have propelled the @entity84 to fourth in the @entity5 table or is it down to two new signings — @entity100 and @entity95 — making an instant impression and @entity102 hitting the form of his life ? @entity106 ’ recruitment at @entity107 was excellent			1
players such as @entity109 and @entity110 were real finds , but during his time at @entity113 he was constantly reminded about how his one big signing , @entity115 , was struggling			0
similarly , look at @entity116			0
he said this week ‘ it was n’t rocket science ’ to see why @entity120 ’s fortunes had dipped			2
losing strikers of the calibre of @entity123 and @entity124 would have an impact on any side			0
it shows how vital it is to buy well and keep your good players			0
i ’ve long felt managers receive too much criticism when things are going badly and they can receive too much praise when they are winning			1
of course , as sir @entity137 says , the manager must be the most important person at a club — but is he more important than players in securing results ? as in any walk of life , there will be some who are more capable of influencing situations than others			1
@entity137 was a serial winner wherever he went and he could be worth up to 10 points a season for @entity113			2
likewise , @entity150 gets results no matter what club he is at			0
both men would tell you they have been blessed to work with great squads of players			0
some would say they were fortunate to be able to utilise such talent , but let ’s not forget how good they have been at attracting the right men to add to their teams ; they know how essential recruitment is			1
@entity116 has struggled in his second season at @entity120 after losing @entity123 the @entity165 hitman now plays in @entity166 , leaving @entity120 with a daunting hole to fill every manager i speak to tells me the most important part of the job is recruitment and it is impossible to disagree			1
when you speak to someone who loses their job abruptly , the first reason they will give is that their signings did n’t work out			1
nothing more needs to be said after that			0
that is why you have to wonder whether there is any point in sacking a manager in the middle of a season			1
yes , clubs tend to benefit with an initial boost for the first five or six games when a new man comes in but then , after the honeymoon period , results tend to level back out			1
again , there is evidence of men who have come in and transformed a club ’s fortunes			2
@entity201 , at @entity202 last season , is probably the most spectacular example of someone rescuing a team that looked to be dead and buried			2
@entity206 ( with @entity207 ) and the late @entity208 ( at @entity209 in 1994 ) , however , are the only others who have joined a club in the relegation zone after @entity1 and been able to keep them in the @entity5			1
@entity208 ( left ) embraces @entity213 - the pair helped @entity209 escape the drop in 1994 @entity202 were bottom when @entity201 took over last december ; by may he had taken them to 11th changing managers does n’t mean a club is waving a magic wand to make things better and that is why i keep coming back to players being absolutely essential to the prospects of those who oversee operations from the sidelines			1
when he first arrived at @entity229 and he had those poor results early on , it was questioned whether he could adapt to the @entity232 game or if the methods that had served him well in @entity234 and with the @entity236 national team would pay off			0
four months on and @entity113 are thriving , but is it just down to @entity238 ? no. @entity113 spent huge money to buy top talents , such as @entity241 , and have others in @entity243 and @entity244 who are making a difference			0
their balance is starting to look right			0
if players perform , managers flourish and then you have a winning formula			1
if players lose their way , the manager , ultimately , will pay			0
@entity227 has steered @entity113 to five straight wins and his side are being talked about as title contenders @entity258 could be player of the year you have to go back to 1985 for the last time a goalkeeper was recognised as being the outstanding player of a season			2
back then , @entity263 — a man i grew up watching — received the @entity266 award for the remarkable form he showed when @entity107 won the @entity268 and last week at @entity229 i began to wonder whether @entity269 might emulate him			1
there has been a lot of debate about where @entity258 stands at the moment in terms of the goalkeepers we have in this country , but there is no doubt in my mind he is now the no 1 , having just edged past @entity28 ’s @entity283			1
@entity269 has been nothing short of exceptional this season , pulling off a string of fine saves @entity283 , who took over from @entity258 at @entity288 , has impressed in his first year in @entity232 @entity263 won the @entity266 award in 1985 helping the @entity107 to win the @entity290 title by 13 points i thought his performance against @entity120 was amazing			1
he never did anything wrong at any stage in the game and , most importantly , gave his defenders the confidence that he would save them when he was called into action			0
he looks a different goalkeeper to the one who first arrived in @entity232			0
if @entity258 keeps playing as he has been , it will be difficult to overlook him at the end of the season			2
with @entity306 in contention for the @entity308 , we are seeing what a difference a top - class goalkeeper makes to a team			0
history shows how hard it is for no 1s to be singled out — @entity316 ( 1976 ) and @entity317 ( 1978 ) are the only keepers to win the @entity319 gong — but if @entity258 maintains this consistency , it might be hard to overlook him			0
this week i 'm excited about ... @entity325 signing @entity323 @entity323 is the best of the @entity5 era there has been widespread acclaim for @entity323 after he announced his retirement this week — and all of the praise has been richly deserved			1
at the peak of his powers , it was almost impossible to stop him			0
i will never forget the moment , during one game at @entity339 , when he engaged overdrive and ran away from me with a change of speed i had not witnessed			0
it felt as though i was trying to chase after someone on a motorbike			0
he is rightly regarded as the best player of the @entity5 era and looking back at some of the footage that has been shown of him in recent days provided a reminder of just how ahead of the game @entity323 was ; the medals he won accurately reflect his talent			1
but if i used to feel apprehensive when i knew i was playing against him , i am looking forward to working with him at @entity325			1
@entity323 is intelligent and knows football but he will know he wo n’t get an easy ride when we are debating the key issues , especially when the focus is on @entity363 !			2

all 20 @entity5 managers who started the season are still in charge
i *'d* certainly back a rule being brought in that prevented clubs sacking their manager during a season
i *'ve* long felt managers receive too much criticism when things are going badly and they can receive too much praise when they are winning
every manager i speak to tells me the most important part of the job is recruitment and it is impossible to disagree
you have to wonder whether there is any point in sacking a manager in the middle of a season
there is no doubt in my mind @entity269 is now the no 1 keeper in this country , having just edged past @entity28 ’s @entity283
and if i used to feel apprehensive when i knew i was playing against @entity323 , i am looking forward to working with him at @entity325
