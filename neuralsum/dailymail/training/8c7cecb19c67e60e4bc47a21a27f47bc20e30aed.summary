@entity0 was just 18 when he first played at @entity1 in 1999			1
@entity2 had won the treble five months earlier and his @entity4 side never had a chance			1
sure enough , @entity2 won 3 - 0 with goals from a trio of all - time club greats @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
but visits to the so - called @entity1 no longer cause fear and dread in the away dressing - room			1
indeed , when @entity0 arrives with @entity17 on sunday , he will be chasing his fourth win in three years at @entity1 , after triumphing twice with @entity19 ( 6 - 1 and 2 - 1 ) and last season with @entity17 ( 1 - 0 ) , their first in 21 years			1
asked if the fear factor has gone , the 53 - cap @entity36 midfielder pulls no punches			2
‘ it took me 12 years to win a @entity41 game there but now i have won the last three times			1
that is just my experience but it sort of shows you that maybe it ’s not what it once was , ’ he said			0
‘ our manager ( @entity48 ) has drummed into the players that we are good enough and this club is big enough to be going to places like @entity1 and get results			2
’ while @entity2 can boast world stars @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , an injury and suspension crisis at the back may require @entity62 to continue at centre - half			2
then @entity19 midfielder @entity0 ( centre ) chases @entity65 ( right ) in 2011 @entity0 's first experience of playing at @entity1 was with @entity4 , shown challenging @entity67 in 2002 even so , it is also @entity0 ’s job as one of his team ’s most experienced players to caution team - mates that even without suspended captain @entity74 , @entity2 are still dangerous			1
‘ we need to show them the respect they deserve			0
they have got loads of talent , and if they put it together on the day they can probably beat anybody so it ’s down to us to produce a good performance			0
‘ i am sure it was a new experience for the players here last season to win away to @entity2			2
it was fantastic to win there last season and a significant result			0
‘ @entity17 had n’t won there for many years and there was a great feeling in the dressing room afterwards to break that duck and put in a great performance			1
‘ that was a big focal point last season for the confidence of the club , to come away from there with three points			0
and i am sure we will be trying to do it again			0
’ @entity48 has his expectations high			0
‘ we do n’t want to be going to places looking at damage limitation or merely hoping for a result , ’ he said .			0

@entity0 was just 18 when he first visited @entity1 as a player
his @entity4 side were beaten 3 - 0 , but now @entity0 believes @entity1 does not *strike* fear into the *opposition* , as it once did
@entity0 has won away at @entity2 three times in the last three years
the @entity17 midfielder says that @entity2 are not what they once were , and that the @entity17 are good enough to go to @entity1 and win
