by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:51 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 06:17 est , 18 september 2013 @entity2 has been criticised by a home office minister after he was captured walking along a @entity5 street			1
@entity7 @entity6 said he was alarmed at the ' intrusiveness ' of images on the website and questioned why more was not done to hide the identities of people photographed by the firm 's cameras			1
he said the @entity2 cars which tour roads throughout @entity17 were ' unnerving ' and suggested the private firms should face more regulation			2
standing out : @entity20 minister @entity6 has been captured on @entity2 carrying his ministerial red box in @entity5 media darling : mr @entity6 has made headlines during the @entity7 conference with remarks on immigration , religious veils and the future of the party captured walking near @entity32 railway station , it is thought he was rushing to catch a train to his @entity35 constituency when he was snapped by the @entity2 cameras			1
he told @entity1 : ' they are meant to make it impossible to identify the person			2
it would not be very hard to work out it was me			0
' mr @entity6 is seen as one of the leading voices on the right of the @entity7 , urging his party to ‘ grow up ’ and not be ‘ bashful ’ about being in government			1
his run of media appearances and staunch defence of remaining in government has seen him emerge as a strong contender for the party leadership , to the irritation of left wing members			1
one leading left wing minister dismissed the leadership talk : ' if he is on manoeuvres they will have to be very long ones			1
' in recent days he has dismissed fears about an influx of immigrants from eastern @entity62 and called for a national debate on banning religious veils in some circumstances			1
now he has questioned the level of privacy regulation governing private firms who take images of members of the public			0
he told journalists : ' i think there is an issue about the intrusiveness of modern technology			0
it is why the government is right to be alert to the public concern about excessive use of @entity83			0
' we need to get the balance right with using technology to prevent crime and people not feeling that every time they enter a public space their movements will be potentially permanently recorded			0
' i do find the surveillance vehicles with cameras on top slightly unnerving when they drive past			0
' campaigners are always most alert to the threats to individual liberties that can be caused by the state but we also need to be guarded about how the evolution of technology means that private organisations can also intrude into individual privacy in a way that many people would find unsettling			0
' quite often the state is more regulated than private organisations			0
' stroll : mr @entity6 , tipped as a potential future leader , was seen outside the @entity111 near @entity32 station manoeuvres : mr @entity6 's media profile has seen him emerge as a potential leadership challenger last week mr @entity6 made headlines after saying workers from @entity118 and @entity119 expected to flock to the @entity17 next year are no different to @entity120 who own holiday homes in @entity122 or @entity123			1
he insisted he was relaxed about the numbers of migrant workers who could come to @entity17 when working limits on the two countries are lifted next year			0
he made the front pages again this week after he suggested the government should consider banning @entity131 girls and young women from wearing the veil in public places			1
mr @entity6 said he was ‘ instinctively uneasy ’ about restricting religious freedoms , but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not			1
’ ‘ there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol , smoking or getting married			0
‘ we should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression			2
’ risky ? @entity152 , pictured with his red box on a train to @entity155 two years ago , is said to have left it unattended on a train last week a former press officer for the party , mr @entity6 was elected in 2005 and became a foreign office minister when the coalition was formed , before moving to the home office last year			1
he has repeatedly argued that the @entity7 must mature into a party of government			2
yesterday he @entity20 minister @entity6 also took a thinly - veiled swipe at mr @entity169 ’s tendency to try to appear ‘ bashful ’ about being part of the coalition			1
speaking at a @entity173 fringe event , mr @entity6 did not mention mr @entity169 by name			0
but he warned : ‘ the task for us as a party is to ask ourselves are we proud of our government or are we ashamed of it ? we need to sell the purpose of the government rather than feeling bashful about it			2
‘ we should n’t equivocate when it comes to the role we have played in the gradual national recovery			0
‘ if we do n’t associate ourselves with those achievements , we do n’t deserve to be associated with the recovery by anybody else			0
' last week @entity152 was left red - faced after apparently leaving his ministerial red box unattended on a train – with the key still in its lock			1
he had been using the distinctive briefcase , bearing his title of ‘ prime minister ’ , to carry official papers as he travelled to a wedding in @entity198			2
it was photographed by a fellow passenger , seemingly unattended on a table , after mr @entity152 wandered to another part of the train .			0
