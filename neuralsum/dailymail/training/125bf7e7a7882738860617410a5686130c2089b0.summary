nine serving @entity1 employees , including some famous faces , are under investigation for ‘ serious allegations ’ of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations about the late @entity7			1
some are being investigated by police while others have been reported to the corporation ’s management			1
but the @entity1 last night refused to say if any of the employees have been suspended			1
a @entity1 source told the @entity24 : ' the allegations are right across the corporation and they involve some famous faces			1
these complaints relate to recent and historic incidents			0
' the revelation about the nine suspects emerged during yesterday ’s questioning of @entity1 director - general @entity33 by mps over the @entity36 affair			1
to add to the @entity42 ’s embarrassment , @entity38 editor @entity37 – who controversially shelved a film detailing @entity7 ’s abuse – faced fresh criticism after an email emerged claiming that he played down the story because ‘ it was 40 years ago ’ and the girls were not ‘ too young ’			1
and culture secretary @entity47 made it clear she was unimpressed with mr @entity33 ’s often faltering performance in front of @entity34 – with aides saying it ‘ resembled a car crash ’			2
@entity1 director - general @entity33 ( right ) and @entity56 of @entity1 editorial policy @entity57 she wrote to @entity60 chairman @entity59 saying ‘ very real concerns are being raised about public trust and confidence in the @entity1 ’			1
in a hostile session of cross-examination , mr @entity33 failed to satisfy those still calling for an independent inquiry as he was repeatedly hauled over the coals and even ridiculed for not finding out more about the @entity36 film when informed about it last december			0
sparked : late tv presenter @entity7 he told the @entity71 : ‘ we are looking at between five and ten serious allegations relating to activities over the whole period in question , the @entity36 period			2
some of these cases have been passed to the police where appropriate , and we are reviewing others within our normal hr processes and procedures			2
’ the @entity1 later said it was ‘ aware of nine allegations of sexual harassment , assault or inappropriate conduct regarding current staff or contributors ’			1
the fact that nine employees are being investigated is a sign that the ‘ broader cultural problem ’ of sexual harassment dating back to the @entity36 years of abuse still needs to be tackled			1
since the scandal erupted at the start of october , @entity1 stars – including @entity95 and @entity96 – have alleged they were groped while live on air			1
asked by the @entity34 if there were active allegations against existing employees , mr @entity33 said : ‘ information is being assembled on exactly that subject			1
‘ new allegations are being made and are coming in			2
what i am looking at is all the existing current allegations			2
’ the director - general did not dispute suggestions that child abuse had been ‘ endemic ’ at the corporation in the past , but insisted children were safe there now			1
‘ i believe we have good policies , but i am currently checking them to make sure they are as good as they need to be			0
’ @entity57 , head of editorial policy , said that if any allegations emerged which related to people still working for the @entity1 , the corporation would ensure they went to the police and that those involved were denied access to children			1
worried : culture secretary @entity47 , left , wrote to @entity60 chairman @entity59 , right , saying ‘ very real concerns are being raised about public trust and confidence in the @entity1 ’			1
mr @entity33 told mps he was bringing in @entity130 – who represented @entity132 in phone hacking cases – to look at how the @entity1 handles sexual harassment cases			1
‘ this is something the @entity1 simply has to get right and i ’m not sure we have got it right in every respect at the moment			2
’ @entity38 boss mr @entity37 ‘ stepped aside ’ from the role earlier this week after a blog he wrote was revealed to be inaccurate in key respects			0
the latest email , revealed yesterday , suggests that mr @entity37 was trying to ‘ kill ’ the @entity144 story by making ‘ impossible editorial demands ’			0
@entity146 said it had seen the email from @entity38 reporter @entity148 , the reporter who worked on the investigation			2
in it she accuses mr @entity37 of backtracking			0
it reads : ‘ having commissioned the story , @entity37 keeps saying he ’s lukewarm about it and is trying to kill it by making impossible editorial demands			0
’ claims : since the scandal erupted at the start of october , @entity1 stars – including @entity95 and @entity96 – have alleged they were groped while live on air she adds : ‘ when we rebut his points , he resorts to saying , “ well , it was 40 years ago ... the girls were teenagers , not too young ... they were n’t the worst kind of sexual offences etc ”			1
’ duties : @entity38 boss mr @entity37 ' stepped aside ' from the role earlier this week after a blog he wrote was revealed to be inaccurate in key respects if true , his comments will outrage child protection groups as they appear to play down @entity7 ’s crimes			0
@entity176 , chief executive of the @entity177 in @entity178 , said : ‘ @entity184			0
he said that , and in the year 2011 ? now we know why he has “ stepped aside ”			0
what an inane thing to say , and sadly reminiscent of the attitudes of too many people who do n’t take these crimes seriously enough			0
’ the email follows another in which mr @entity37 , when referring to the evidence the programme , had used the phrase ‘ just the women ’			0
broadcast on @entity194 it read : ‘ the key is whether we can establish the @entity196 did drop the case for the reasons the women say			0
that makes it a better story – our sources so far are just the women and a second - hand briefing ’			0
conservative mp @entity203 said the email was ‘ chilling ’ and questioned whether the culture had really changed at the @entity1			2
mr @entity33 told her : ‘ that phrase , on the face of it , is n’t in the least defensible , of course			0
i do believe the culture has changed since the @entity211 and @entity212 but i ’m not convinced it has changed as much as it should have			0
’ emails that suggested senior @entity1 executives tried to cover up the scandal were pulled from the @entity194 programme for ‘ legal reasons ’ amid concerns that others implicated in the shelving of the report could sue for damages			2
at least one of these emails suggests the @entity144 report was being discussed by a ‘ long political chain ’ of executives .			0

nine serving @entity1 employees are under investigation for ' serious allegations ' of sexual abuse following the sickening revelations
some are being investigated by police while others have been reported to the corporation ’s management .
