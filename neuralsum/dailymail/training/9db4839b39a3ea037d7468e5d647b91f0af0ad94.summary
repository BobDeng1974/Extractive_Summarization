@entity0 was once a highly - rated future @entity1 captain , right ? sadly , his career is drifting by			1
it says everything that @entity5 actually improved following his second - half dismissal			1
but do n’t let that minor upturn mask what was a dreadful match – what must home debutant @entity7 have thought ? on this evidence , he ’s staring at an awfully long three - and - a - half years on @entity13			1
referee @entity14 shows @entity5 midfielder @entity0 the red card after a second bookable offence on saturday @entity0 was cautioned for impeding @entity18 goalkeeper @entity17 to receive a second booking and get sent off the former @entity22 midfielder 's unnecessary challenge on the @entity18 keeper reduced the home side to ten men @entity0 hangs his head as he walks off the pitch having been sent off for @entity5 at the @entity28 on saturday in the @entity29 @entity5 striker @entity7 looks on with frustration as the home side struggled to break down their @entity33 opponents @entity5 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity34 6 ; @entity35 6 , @entity36 6.5 , @entity37 6 ; @entity38 6 ( @entity39 75 , 5.5 ) , @entity40 6.5 , @entity41 6 , @entity0 4 , @entity42 6 ; @entity43 5 ( @entity44 66 , 6 ) , @entity7 6.5 subs not used : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 booked : @entity37 , @entity0 sent off , @entity39 manager : @entity52 5 @entity18 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity17 7.5 ; @entity53 6 , @entity54 6.5 , @entity55 6 , @entity56 6 ; @entity57 6 , @entity58 5.5 ( @entity59 61 , 6 ) , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6.5 ( @entity62 75 , 6 ) ; @entity63 5.5 , @entity64 ( @entity65 75 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , burn manger : @entity72 6 referee : @entity14 @entity74 : @entity17 attendance : 22,961 @entity5 fans can only hope he does not regress into the same rut in which @entity0 finds himself			1
this was only his 12th start since his £ 10 million arrival from @entity22 , but that fee looks inflated with every sorry showing			0
the 23 - year - old was lucky not to see red for a first - half lunge on @entity56 , but was given his marching orders for a second yellow when he needlessly impeded goalkeeper @entity17 on 66 minutes			1
remarkably , @entity5 boss @entity52 refused to criticise the three - times - capped midfielder			2
‘ sometimes you do things that you would not do again			0
you do n’t have time to think			0
i ’m not bothered about it , ’ he said			0
what @entity52 was disturbed by was his side ’s lacklustre performance			2
‘ i ’m more bothered about the disconnection with the fans			0
i think they want @entity99 and @entity100 back , but that ’s not going to happen , ’ he added			0
‘ the first half was poor and it was difficult to watch			2
we did n’t pass it well or have the pressure in their half			2
i would n’t like to watch that week in , week out			0
the first half was everything which has become so disheartening about this competition at times - two teams feigning interest , rendering the contest utterly meaningless			1
highlights ? lowlights more like			0
there was a @entity119 shot which smashed new team - mate @entity7 flush in the face			2
that got a laugh , at least			0
the home crowd were rightly restless at half - time			1
despite playing two up front – @entity7 and @entity43 – @entity52 eroded that positivity by starting with five defenders			0
it was n’t until the 56th minute that @entity7 registered an effort towards goal – a dipping 25 - yard strike dropping way wide			2
still , it was progress			0
@entity5 's @entity0 attempts to shield the ball from @entity54 of @entity18 at the @entity28 in their @entity29 clash @entity57 of @entity18 keeps the ball in on the byline for the @entity33 side under a challenge from @entity40 @entity5 striker @entity43 attempts to hit the target for the @entity5 whilst @entity55 of @entity18 tries to make a block and @entity7 came a damn sight closer to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when his volley , from @entity38 ’ centre , was shoveled around the post by man - of - the - match @entity17			1
the new signing drew another instinctive stop from the @entity18 netminder when flicking @entity0 ’s mishit shot on target , @entity17 reacting to shin clear			1
from the resulting corner the keeper confidently gathered and , as he strode forward to launch a counter-attack , @entity0 intervened with a mindless tug and was off			1
@entity18 boss @entity72 – whose side could have nicked it when @entity65 cracked the post late on – said : ‘ the sending - off stirred @entity5 into life if anything			1
‘ but to come here to a @entity164 side and equip ourselves like we did , i can be proud			0
’ as it is , these two will replay a week on tuesday – just do n’t expect a surge for tickets			0
there is chaos in the @entity5 penalty area as @entity5 keeper @entity34 misses a cross during the @entity29 fourth round tie @entity43 attempts an audacious volley for the @entity176 as the @entity18 defence watches on @entity14 brandishes the red card to @entity0 after his second booking in @entity29 fourth round tie with @entity18 on saturday @entity5 's new acquisition looks on during the @entity29 fourth round clash with @entity183 @entity18 on saturday afternoon @entity5 's latest striking recruit @entity7 unleashes a dipping volley but his effort failed to find the back of the @entity18 net @entity62 of @entity18 races down the wing during the @entity29 fourth round clash at the @entity28 on saturday afternoon @entity7 applauds the home fans after the game as @entity18 's @entity65 ( centre ) and @entity63 ( right ) help earn a @entity29 replay			1

@entity0 is sent off for a second yellow in the second - half , blocking @entity18 keeper @entity17 's throw
@entity18 striker @entity65 nearly won it for the @entity33 side late on but his effort hit the post
the @entity29 fourth round replay will take place in @entity205 at @entity206 on *february* 3
