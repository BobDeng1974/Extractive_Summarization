by @entity0 published : 19:17 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 19:20 est , 10 june 2013 heart - healthy : using vegetable oil instead of animal fats could slow down the spread of prostate cancer swapping to vegetable oils and nuts may increase a man ’s chances of surviving prostate cancer			1
a study found that those diagnosed with the disease early had a lower risk of the cancer spreading if they replaced animal fats found in processed foods – such as cake and pastries – with healthy vegetable fats			1
one serving of oil - based salad dressing a day , equivalent to one tablespoon , was linked with a 29 per cent lower risk of potentially lethal prostate cancer and a 13 per cent lower chance of dying from any cause			1
the @entity29 authors stressed the research involving 4,577 prostate cancer patients had revealed an association and could not necessarily prove a diet rich in oils and nuts was the cause			2
in an online paper published by the journal @entity39 , they wrote : ‘ overall , our findings support counselling men with prostate cancer to follow a heart - healthy diet in which carbohydrate calories are replaced with unsaturated oils and nuts to reduce the risk of all - cause mortality			1
’ of the men with prostate cancer enrolled into the study , around a fifth died from the disease over a period of about eight years			0
another 31 per cent died from heart disease and almost 21 per cent from other cancers			0
at the time they were recruited , all the men had non-metastatic prostate cancer , meaning the disease had not yet spread			0
information about the patients ’ dietary habits was collected from questionnaires			0
swapping animal fats and carbohydrates for healthy vegetable fats , including olive and canola oil as well as oils from nuts , seeds and avocados , was found to have a significant impact on disease progression and death			0
the study found oils from nuts , seeds and avocados were found to have a significant impact on disease progression and death men who replaced 10 per cent of their daily carbohydrate consumption with vegetable fats had a 29 per cent lower risk of developing deadly prostate cancer and a 26 per cent reduced risk of dying from any cause			1
the study also showed that eating an ounce of nuts a day led to an 18 per cent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and an 11 per cent lower risk of death			2
dr @entity94 , from the @entity95 , said : ‘ consumption of healthy oils and nuts increases plasma ( blood ) antioxidants and reduces insulin and inflammation , which may deter prostate cancer progression			0

study finds lower risk of cancer spreading if processed foods are replaced
a heart - healthy diet could save lives , according to @entity29 *scientists*
