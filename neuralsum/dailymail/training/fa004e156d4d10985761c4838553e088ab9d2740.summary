the @entity8 , trophy-less since winning @entity9 last year , eased past the world number 85 to set up a clash with @entity13 's @entity12 who earlier ousted @entity16 third seed @entity17 7 - 6 ( 7 ) 6 - 4			1
@entity0 is facing a battle to qualify for the year - ending @entity19 and needs a healthy haul of points from his remaining events this year to make the eight - man @entity24 finale			2
@entity0 beat @entity4 in the @entity7 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 as he bids to reach the @entity19 @entity25 @entity0 is looking to end his trophyless run since winning @entity9 and is in the @entity7 last - four @entity28 's number one hopes to qualify for the @entity29 in @entity24 and is currently in 11th place 1 @entity31 8150 ( number of points ) - qualified 2 @entity34 7020 - qualified 3 @entity35 6645 - qualified 4 @entity36 4795 5 @entity37 3935 6 @entity38 3675 7 @entity39 3535 8 @entity40 3510 - - - - - - - - - - - - 9 @entity42 3440 10 @entity43 3335 11 @entity0 3155 12 @entity44 2650 his cause was boosted earlier in the week when @entity46 's @entity39 , one of the players he is vying with for one of the five remaining slots , crashed out early			1
@entity0 , ranked 11th in the @entity19 world rankings and also in the race standings , took a wildcard to compete in @entity7 and it could prove a fruitful decision seeing as he is now clear favourite to land the indoor title			1
