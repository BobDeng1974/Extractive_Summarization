by @entity0 published : 16:49 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 12 july 2013 goodbye mr @entity1 : louis as his alter ego @entity4 , which became a household name in the 1980s he was never a household name , yet he was the very definition of a household face			1
louis the chimp , who has died at the grand old age of 37 , was famous up and down the land as @entity4 , the secret agent just as debonair as @entity13 ’s 007 — with even more chest hair — in the @entity16 adverts for @entity17			1
it may be stretching a point to suggest @entity4 became as iconic as his human alter ego , @entity22 , but then again , it may not			1
with his catchphrase ‘ the name ’s @entity25 ’ , he was voiced by the suave actor @entity27 , and became an instant hit when he first appeared in 1981			1
little wonder that six years ago , the @entity17 chimp adverts , which ran from 1956 to 2001 , were voted the most memorable in tv history , narrowly ahead of the aliens advertising @entity34 instant mashed potato , who laughed so rudely at earth people peeling potatoes with our metal knives , boiling them for 20 of our minutes , and then smashing them all to bits			1
moreover , we did n’t have to get used to a series of different faces playing @entity4 , as with 007			1
and yet the fame never went to his head			1
‘ he was quiet and calm , which is quite unusual for male chimps , ’ said dr @entity48 , curator at @entity49 in @entity50 , where @entity2 died on monday following a short illness			1
‘ he was sociable and popular with the keepers			1
‘ they were together a very long time , and chimps can pine just like humans , but she ’s eating well , which is good			1
’ choppers was not , of course , offered that time - honoured @entity72 palliative to ease the shock of a long - term companion ’s death — a cup of sweetened tea			1
but like @entity2 , she also appeared in the @entity17 commercials , and therefore played a part in one of tv ’s longest - lasting and most effective campaigns			2
perhaps the most affectionately remembered of all was the one in the @entity84 ( not featuring @entity2 ) in which two chimps cast as father and son removal men accidentally dropped a piano down a flight of stairs			2
the pay - off — using dubbed human voices — entered the annals of popular culture			2
‘ @entity97 , do you know the piano ’s on my foot ? ’ ‘ you hum it , son , i ’ll play it			2
’ instant hit : @entity4 's catchphrase became almost as famous as his human alter ego watch : @entity4 starring in a @entity17 ad from the 1980s such was the impact of those adverts that another of them is said to have undermined the popularity of the tandem bike			1
also dating from the early seventies , it parodied the @entity117 in the days when the @entity72 were nowhere near as strong in the venerable race as they are now , and thus considered it ripe for mickey - taking			2
a chimp playing a sexy @entity122 made eyes at another , playing a stricken cyclist , who asked , in a @entity128 accent : ‘ can you ride tandem ? ’ ' sociable animal ' : @entity2 , pictured aged five playing with a @entity133 's cube , was popular with his keepers that gave rise to a catchphrase which remained the bane of cyclists ’ lives for some years on @entity72 highways and byways			2
the tandem , which had once been considered rather a dashing machine , practically overnight became a joke			2
it was another marker of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign , which was inspired by the chimps ’ tea parties held at @entity150 in the @entity151			2
tv advertising was born on @entity153 at precisely 8.12pm on september 22 , 1955 , during a variety show hosted by bandleader and dj @entity156			2
viewers saw a tube of @entity160 toothpaste embedded in a block of ice			2
within months , the @entity17 chimps were added to the burgeoning mix of commercials to promote a brand of tea which @entity4 ( the company , not the chimp ) had launched in @entity72 in 1930			1
two years after the adverts were launched , @entity17 had moved up from fourth place to be the top - selling tea in the @entity72			1
the idea of ‘ talking ’ animals was an instant hit — as were their costumes — and while it is the norm now , at the time it was a delightful innovation			2
it helped , too , that the chimps were voiced over the years by luminaries such as @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
but the real stars , of course , were the animals themselves			0
in 1977 , mail photographer @entity187 photographed a preview of the latest commercial at @entity190			0
‘ @entity191 , the director and founder , had turned @entity190 into a world - leading centre for primates , ’ he recalled			0
‘ these chimpanzees were absolutely amazing			0
she talked to them , gave them things to hold and things to do			0
they were terrific show - offs really , and there was a bit of misbehaviour , but not more than you ’d expect from a group of children			0
‘ in fact , working with them that day , i found that after a while i forgot they were chimpanzees and looked at them as if they were children			0
you can find as much emotion on a chimp ’s face as you can on any six - year - old child ’s			0
’ stars : chimpanzee actors @entity220 with @entity191 who founded @entity49 and trained the animals monkey business : the @entity17 ads were part of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign but just as the chimps ’ tea parties once held at @entity150 fell prey to growing sensibilities about the perceived exploitation of animals , so too did the @entity17 commercials			1
in 2001 , following complaints by animal rights activists , the axe fell			0
the decision reflected the political correctness of the times , but it was still widely lamented			0
it is hard to imagine similar anxieties now if , for instance , those infernal @entity242 - accented meerkats were killed off			0
but then tv commercials do not burrow into our affections as they once did , possibly because we can now wield our remote - control units to wind forward through the breaks			0
the irony is that there are infinitely more adverts on @entity72 tv now than there were in the heyday of the @entity17 campaign — when advertising was offered by only a single channel — yet they are infinitely less influential			1
my children know perhaps three or four catchphrases or jingles from tv commercials , yet at their age i knew at least 50			1
and i remember them just as keenly now			0
most people over the age of 45 are still aware that @entity266 works wonders , that nothing beats the great smell of @entity270 , and that @entity271 looks good , tastes good and by golly it does you good			1
success : adverts like this one for @entity276 cigars were hugely popular in the seventies even those who celebrated the end of those @entity17 ads , feeling that they demeaned the chimps , would surely have to admit that they were brilliantly conceived and executed			1
and while there is much dynamism in the advertising industry still , most tv advertising now is either vacuously inane , or too complex and cynical for its own good			0
where is the simple humour ? in the @entity84 , tv advertising ’s golden age , humour sold enough @entity276 cigars and @entity295 to sink battleships			1
significantly , those were the years when several men destined to join the ranks of @entity72 ’s finest film directors were cutting their teeth on tv commercials			0
the @entity295 adverts starring @entity304 and @entity305 , which — like those for @entity276 — celebrated cack - handedness , were conceived by @entity308 , who later brought us the movies @entity310 and @entity312			1
music , too , was used more effectively than now			0
it used to be said the definition of an intellectual was someone who listened to @entity318 ’s @entity319 without thinking of the @entity320 , and something similar might also be said of @entity323 ’s @entity322 , from @entity324 , which to the over- 45s is far better known as ‘ everyone ’s @entity325 ’ from the @entity34 ’s advert			0
@entity328 : adverts like this one for @entity295 used simple humour to sell products as for @entity341 ’s @entity340 , for millions of us that evokes only one thing : a young lad pushing a bike loaded with loaves of @entity338 up a steep cobbled street			1
that seminal 1973 advert , incidentally , was directed by a certain @entity343 , who went on to create @entity344			0
we do n’t yet know whether any of this generation of commercial directors will end up being knighted for services to the @entity72 film industry , like sir @entity308 and sir @entity343			0
but they are plying their trade in less creative times			0
so , as we celebrate the memory of @entity2 the chimp and his simian mates , we should also celebrate not only one of the great advertising campaigns , but an entire era when tv commercials looked good , tasted good and by golly — if only by giving us so much collective pleasure — did us good .			0
