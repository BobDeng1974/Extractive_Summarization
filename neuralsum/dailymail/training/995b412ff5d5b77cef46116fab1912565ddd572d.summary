@entity8 , formerly @entity9 , started her £ 18,000 sex - change operation in 2010 while serving an 11 - year sentence for burglary			1
the treatment sparked outrage as ms @entity8 , 37 , claimed it was a better use of money than drugs for cancer			1
demands : @entity8 , 37 , took sex - change tablets while serving an 11 - year jail sentence for burglary			1
she now claims it is her ' right ' to be granted £ 15,000 - worth of surgery , including another breast enlargement two years after leaving @entity25 in @entity26 , the self - professed surgery addict , who has three children , is now applying to enlarge her breasts from a size @entity31 to @entity33			1
ms @entity8 told the @entity34 sunday : ' they are ok now but i 'm quite a big person so it would look better if they were larger			2
' she also claims it is her ' right ' to have her jaw realigned , hairline lowered , and a nose straightened in a series of treatments amounting to £ 15,000			1
' i do n't see why not , otherwise it 's half a job			0
they did it last time so i do n't see why it 's different			0
' the @entity4 needs to finish the job			0
' ms @entity8 , from @entity48 , north @entity49 , was born with both male and female genitals and was raised as a girl called @entity52 until she was eight			2
she claims she was encouraged by her parents to live as a boy called @entity9 and says she felt pressured to be ' macho ' by her father			0
it was as a result of this gender confusion that she took her first steps into a life of crime in an attempt to appear more macho			0
crime : she was born with both male and female genitals , and forced to live as a boy called @entity9 , ms @entity8 claims			1
she says it was this confusion that led her to a life of crime in 1994 , aged 18 , she was jailed for burglary for the first time			0
she spent the next few years in and out of prison until may 2006 when , while serving an 11 - year stretch for a string of burglaries , she told a prison nurse she was transex and wanted to live a new life as a woman			1
when the details of the operation emerged , ms @entity8 , then @entity9 , argued her condition was as ' life - threatening as cancer ' because of high suicide rates among the transgender community			1
@entity9 added that giving him the treatment was cost - effective as , too depressed to work , he would be forced to claim benefits			2
ms @entity8 , who works for a charity that helped her with the sex change , has a 16 - year - old son from one relationship and two children from a marriage to a different woman , who are now nine and 10			1
when she - then he - was alone with his eldest son , she would pretend to be the child 's mother and wore her girlfriend 's clothes			0
she no longer sees her children			0
after the breakdown of the marriage and she was moved to an open prison , ms @entity8 applied to the @entity4 for cash for gender reassignment			2
hormone tablets made her grow breasts , a charity donated women 's clothes and make up and £ 18,000 from the @entity4 paid for electrolysis and laser treatment to remove body hair , followed by surgery to transform her genitals			0
although the @entity4 refused to pay for breast enhancement , she has since had surgery to gain a @entity31 chest - and claims her sex life has ' gone wild ' since the op. @entity4 guidelines only permit taxpayer - funded plastic surgery in extreme cases , such as to protect a patient 's mental health			2
a spokesman for the @entity127 said : ' prisoners have the right to receive the same range and quality of @entity4 treatments and services as anyone else , including services for gender reassignment			0
