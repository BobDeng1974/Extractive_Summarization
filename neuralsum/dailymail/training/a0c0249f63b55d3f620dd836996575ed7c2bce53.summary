the @entity0 has removed a warning from its website that @entity4 can , in rare cases , spread from person through coughing and sneezing			1
it has replaced the old language with new guidance that says there 's ' no evidence ' @entity4 is spread through either			1
according to the @entity10 , the @entity0 also took down on thursday a poster that said that @entity4 can be transferred through ' droplets ' from coughing or sneezing that land on hard surfaces , like doorknobs			1
the @entity0 previously suggested that @entity4 can , in rare cases , spread from person through coughing and sneezing			1
it now says there ' no evidence ' to support that claim as the @entity29 , which discovered the shift in language , noted yesterday evening , it 's unclear why the @entity0 abruptly changed it 's @entity4 advisories			1
however , the move came a day after the @entity10 reported on the existence of the poster			0
' droplet spread happens when germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes , nose or mouth of another person , ' the fact sheet reportedly stated			0
now the page says , ' the what ’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets ? fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable			0
please visit cdc.gov / @entity4 for up - to - date information on @entity4			2
' the quiet removal of the information follows a weeks long public health campaign championed @entity55 sen. @entity55 to get the @entity0 to be ' forthright ' about how the disease is spread			1
previously the @entity0 's frequently asked questions page on @entity4 said : ' although coughing and sneezing are not common symptoms of @entity4 , if a symptomatic patient with @entity4 coughs or sneezes on someone , and saliva or mucus come into contact with that person ’s eyes , nose or mouth , these fluids may transmit the disease			2
a @entity0 poster claiming that @entity4 can spread through ' droplets ' of germs on hard surfaces such as doorknobs has been quietly removed from the government agency 's website @entity55 has pointed to similar statements from the @entity0 on numerous occasions as evidence that someone could in fact catch @entity4 through the air if in close range of someone who has the virus at , say , a party			1
if ' you listen to them closely , they say you have to have direct contact			0
but you know how they define direct contact ? being within three feet of someone , ' he said on one recent occasion			0
given that information , the @entity97 senator has characterized the @entity0 's claims that the deadly disease could only be spread through direct contact with an infected person 's bodily fluids and the virus does not travel through the air as misleading			2
' they have so wanted to downplay this that they really , i do n't think , have been very accurate in their description of the disease , ' @entity55 told @entity112 earlier this month			0
possibly in response to @entity55 's claims , the @entity0 has now changed at least one page of it 's website to say , ' there is no evidence indicating that ebola virus is spread by coughing or sneezing			1
' ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with @entity4 ; the virus is not transmitted through the air ( like measles virus )			0
' however , droplets ( e.g. , splashes or sprays ) of respiratory or other secretions from a person who is sick with @entity4 could be infectious , and therefore certain precautions ( called standard , contact , and droplet precautions ) are recommended for use in healthcare settings to prevent the transmission of ebola virus from patients sick with @entity4 to healthcare personnel and other patients or family members			0
' the senator was n't immediately available to comment on the @entity0 's updated guidance .			2
