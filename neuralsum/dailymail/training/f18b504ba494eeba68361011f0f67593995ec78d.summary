argument : @entity1 has said current divorce system is ' terribly unfair ' and needs urgent reform because it sends a ' bad message ' to women @entity8 's divorce laws should be tougher on women because they are encouraged to shun work and ' find a footballer ' to marry , a female peer has said			1
@entity1 , who is standing down as the chair of the @entity12 , believes the divorce system is ' terribly unfair ' and needs urgent reform			1
she says as the law stands young women are sent the ' bad message ' to find someone rich and ' once you are married you need never go out to work '			1
' never mind about a levels or a degree or taking the bar course — come out and find a footballer , ' she told the @entity22			0
she believes that couples should settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding and this would stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth			2
the peer is currently backing a @entity33 bill that would make prenuptial and postnuptial agreements agreements legally binding			1
she said : ' we have a whole area of law which says once you are married you need never go out to work , [ that ] you are automatically entitled to everything you might need even if that marriage breaks down and it 's your fault			1
' the system is in sharp contrast with calls for equality where women should get half the posts on @entity49 boards and the @entity50 , she said			2
last month the husband in @entity8 ’s biggest ever divorce case should receive the lion ’s share of the £ 870million fortune at stake because he did most to make their fortune , a judge ruled			0
sir @entity59 , son of a @entity61 motor mechanic , will take more than half a billion pounds from the wreck of his marriage due to his extraordinary achievements as an ‘ activist investor ’			0
his city coups were worth billions and included a profit of more than £ 600million from the takeover that led to the collapse of the @entity70 , as well as a £ 100million profit from last year ’s botched privatisation of @entity73			0
sir @entity59 ’s wife @entity74 is likely to appeal against the decision by mrs @entity77 to deny her an equal share of the couple ’s vast wealth			0
battle : sir @entity59 , the husband in @entity8 ’s biggest ever divorce case , will keep the lion ’s share of the £ 870million fortune because a judge did more than his ex-wife @entity83 to earn the money row : @entity1 believes that couples should settle terms of their divorce before their wedding to stop women marrying successful men and then running off with a large share of their wealth in @entity94 battles mrs @entity95 , who has been awarded £ 330million , raised their four children and ran the charitable foundations into which her husband poured most of the money made			1
the judge said , however , that he had also played a major role in managing the charities and that the couple would have no fortune to divide without him			0
@entity107 has previously argued that changes to divorce laws would also better protect career women			2
she said on @entity112 ’s @entity111 earlier this year : ‘ lots of young women these days are working , earning well , and would feel it extremely unfair if a young man who they marry and perhaps leaves them is going to take with him a sizeable chunk of what they have worked so hard for			2
‘ the position of women has changed in the last 40 years and it ’s time to recognise that in this country , like virtually every country in the world , two people who are getting married ought to be able , if they want , to make a contract about how their assets are to be divided if they divorce			0

@entity1 says laws mean women are being send a ' bad message '
says they are encouraged to marry rich men and ' never go out to work '
she is backing bill to *enforce* prenuptial and postnuptial agreements
' we have a whole area of law which says *...* you are entitled to everything you might need even if that marriage breaks down and it 's your fault '
