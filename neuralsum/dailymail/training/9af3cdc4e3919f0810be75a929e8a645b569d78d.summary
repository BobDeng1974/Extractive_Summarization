the ' kill mission ' against @entity2 boss @entity1 carries chilling echoes of tv show homeland where the chief terror suspect @entity5 is supposedly killed in a drone attack			1
in the @entity12 series , the @entity8 mastermind battling @entity10 station chief @entity9 is very much alive , pulling the insurgent strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the @entity17			1
i wonder if @entity19 was doing the same			0
it would certainly suit him to play dead for a while - plus , he 's risen from beyond the grave before			0
even now , the @entity22 is seeking to confirm whether coalition air strikes have critically injured or even managed to kill the elusive ' caliph '			1
' the air strike targeted a meeting held between the @entity38 leader and his key aides in an area near al - kanadi school in @entity51 district			1
' ' the leader of the group , known as @entity1 has been injured while his key aide @entity54 was reportedly killed			0
senior leaders and experts in explosive devices were also killed in the attack including @entity59 and @entity60 , known as @entity61 , the leader of @entity62 within the @entity38			1
' but will his injuries make any difference to the terror group ? normally so effusive on social media , @entity38 are being strangely coy about the losses it may have sustained this weekend , though it has started arresting former members of the @entity36 army lest they are providing the @entity17 with actionable intelligence			1
it was telling too , that reports of his demise originally leaked out apparently from @entity76 sources			2
@entity38 is probably scouring their deep substitute bench for replacements for anyone killed			2
in the @entity12 series , the @entity8 mastermind battling @entity10 station chief @entity9 ( pictured ) is very much alive , pulling the strings from his perfect hiding place and spinning a web of lies to dupe the @entity17 @entity19 has made a lifelong virtue of anonymity , especially since his @entity91 mentor , @entity89 was killed in a @entity17 bombing raid in 2006			1
except for his brief appearance in @entity94 in july to proclaim himself @entity95 ( an office that fuses political and religious leadership ) , @entity19 has kept a low profile , so that the fate of @entity38 does not appear to hinge on his personal survival			2
it also offers the perfect cover should @entity19 wish to disappear for a while , @entity104 - style			2
for @entity105 has been careful to organize @entity38 in such a way that power is highly decentralised , with a clear division between those responsible for administering territories the terror group controls and those who direct its military operations			1
@entity38 has been careful to include many @entity116 tribal figures in administration , precisely to pre-empt any @entity17 attempt to trigger a tribal uprising against them , a strategy the @entity17 pursued against @entity76 ( @entity38 's forerunner ) in 2007 - 08 with some success			1
targeted : @entity1 was reportedly wounded on friday night when @entity17 warplanes hit a ten - car @entity38 convoy like this one southwest of @entity94 , which functions as @entity38 's capital in northern @entity36 ( file picture ) @entity38 's military command includes at least two @entity130 @entity36 army generals on the run since the @entity133 era , who clearly have considerable tactical ability			1
@entity38 has used lightning advances and exemplary terror as well as suicide bombers to destroy enemy command and control centres			2
they also use the destruction of bridges and controlled flooding to shape battlefields to their choosing , and the deployment of roadside bombs and embedded tanks to inhibit countermoves by their @entity36 or @entity151 opponents			2
so far , the @entity17 response has been to remove the unpopular @entity154 prime minister of @entity36 , to reduce the alienation of the country 's @entity116 and limited efforts to restore the fighting morale of the @entity36 national army , which , poorly led , effectively fled from this ferocious opponent			1
the only effective obstacles to @entity38 taking over the country have been @entity154 militias in @entity164 and further south , and the @entity151 peshmerga in the north			2
although the @entity17 has added a further 1,500 military advisers , bringing their total strength to over 3000 , they have to be careful since the same @entity154 militias are restive about a renewed @entity17 ' occupation ' of @entity36			1
@entity17 airstrikes have been criticised as a drizzle when what is required resembles a cloud burst in a thunder storm			2
taken out : according to @entity36 sources , parallel attacks on @entity178 in @entity179 ( above ) killed one of the terror group 's top strategists in a predominantly @entity116 region where @entity38 has made huge military advances in recent weeks as the world 's attention was distracted by its relentless siege of @entity189 in northern @entity40 so far there have been an average of five strikes a day , compared with 50 in @entity193 in 2011 , 85 in @entity194 , and 800 a day in @entity36 itself during the 2003 @entity17 - led invasion			1
so far , only 800 of the 3 , 200 sorties over @entity36 and @entity40 have actually involved dropping bombs or firing missiles			0
until these raids at the weekend , there has been an absence of actionable intelligence from the ground , while @entity22 lawyers are being ultra cautious about avoiding any civilian casualties			0
the long distance planes have to fly from bases in @entity209 or the @entity210 , or from carriers in the @entity212 , also makes it hard for them to loiter looking for targets of opportunity			0
so while it would be a significant blow to @entity38 to lose its self - styled @entity95 , he is replaceable in what in practice is a collective leadership with many experienced and hardened personalities			0
prisoner : @entity19 , shown before his rise to power , was held as a prisoner by the @entity17 during the occupation of @entity36 @entity1 is the relatively discreet leader of the @entity2 extremist group			1
he used to play for his mosque 's soccer team and has a phd in @entity232 history			0
but after spending four years in a @entity17 camp during the @entity36 occupation , he emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world			1
the government placed a $ 10 million bounty on his head in 2011 when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous			0
this warrant was publicized once more following the beheadings of @entity17 nationals @entity245 and @entity247 as well as @entity249 @entity248 and @entity250			0
he maintained a low profile for months as @entity38 , the group 's original name , rose to global infamy and @entity91 denounced them as ' too extreme '			0
but he finally revealed himself to the public with a speech , filmed and posted on @entity259 , in the first week of july this year			0
born @entity260 in 1971 near @entity261 , @entity36 , he came from a @entity263 family - a tolerant form of @entity232			0
in the 1990s , he completed a phd in @entity164 and played soccer with friends			0
but he fell out with mosque leaders and fled to @entity179 province where he joined @entity116 groups protesting the @entity17 occupation			0
@entity17 forces detained @entity1 at @entity273 in 2005 shortly after the @entity36 invasion			1
he was released when the camp closed in 2009			0
he was thought to be ' bad but not the worst ' sources told @entity277			0
but he then joined the @entity2 of @entity36 and @entity40 , and rose up the ranks rapidly			1
after allegedly killing the leader , @entity279 , he took hold of the terror group .			0

@entity2 chief believed to have been hit in @entity17 strike on convoy in @entity36
but the @entity22 is still seeking confirmation three days after the attack
suspicions aroused after news of his death was apparently leaked by @entity38
chilling echoes of @entity104 plot where terror chief fakes death to fool @entity17
