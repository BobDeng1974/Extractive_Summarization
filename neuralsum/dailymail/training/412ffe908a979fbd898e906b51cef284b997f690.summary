people who live in central @entity2 are meaner than those in the suburbs , who are happier , calmer and even a little bit boring , a study has revealed			1
residents in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 were deemed to be less considerate while those living in @entity11 and @entity12 were the nicest , according to researchers			1
the study by @entity16 psychologists found those with specific personality traits tended to live in the same area , for example the most sociable people flock to boroughs in south @entity2			1
this map shows the level of agreeableness by residents in @entity2 is more so in the outskirts , with the least agreeable people living in central parts of the city meanwhile those living in central areas were far more open to trying new experiences than their neighbours on the outskirts , who become progressively less adventurous the further out they are			1
the researchers also found higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of @entity2 and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west , north east , and south @entity2			1
in those areas , the most agreeable and conscientious types tended to be slightly more satisfied , suggesting that these traits are more important determinants of life satisfaction			0
those with the most volatile personalities lived in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , while the residents of @entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 were most emotionally stable , according to the @entity56			0
the most emotionally stable @entity57 live in western central london - areas like @entity53 and @entity54 and @entity55 - while those in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are more volatile , according to the study there are higher levels of life satisfaction in the most affluent areas of @entity2 ( west central ) and pockets of low life satisfaction in north west , north east , and south @entity2 while the study , undertaken by an international team of researchers , shows the most miserable @entity57 live in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
psychologists found the least agreeable areas were in western central @entity2 - an area with the highest crime rate , busiest pedestrian traffic and some of the highest housing prices in the capital			2
researchers believe this could support the idea that residents of big cities tend to be less considerate towards other people			0
dr @entity87 , from the @entity88 in @entity89 , said : ' it ’s very common for people to talk about where is the best place to live			2
' but most research has tended to look at factors such as income and low crime rates , and only on a very broad geographical scale , failing to consider individual differences in personality			0
' as a result , studies imply that all people would be equally happy in the same places			0
' it ’s a one - size - fits - all conclusion that , as we show , is misleading because one ’s level of happiness is dependent on whether their environment is suited to their personality			0
' the most sociable @entity57 flock to south of the river while the further out you live , the least extrovert the residents are the more conscientious @entity57 live on the outskirts with the least choosing boroughs in the north dr @entity121 , from the @entity120 at @entity16 , said the findings could prove useful for those deciding on an area to live			1
he said : ' together , these findings not only add to our understanding of the ways in which features of our personalities relate to our physical environments , but they also provide potentially useful information for choosing a place to live			0
' granted , most people do n't have the luxury of complete control over where they live , but given their budgets , people can decide whether it 's more important to live in the centre of town , where daily life is vibrant and accommodation is small , or further out where daily life is slower but space is more plentiful			2
' making the decision that fits with your personality could have an effect on your overall life satisfaction			0
' psychologists used data from the @entity155 's @entity154 and honed in on the 56,000 @entity57 to examine how associations between personality and life satisfaction differed across the 216 postal districts			1
the research , funded by the @entity161 and the @entity162 , was published in the journal @entity164			0
those most open to trying new experiences live closest to the centre of the capital , with suburb residents significantly less adventurous			2

@entity7 and @entity9 and @entity10 home to least agreeable people
those living in @entity11 and @entity12 were nicest , according to research
most sociable live in south @entity2 while more *introverts* live on outskirts
@entity16 psychologists analysed data from 56,000 @entity57
dr @entity121 said it could help those deciding where to live in capital
