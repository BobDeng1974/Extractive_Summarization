@entity10 flew to @entity11 from @entity12 for the rare opportunity to swim with @entity14 , a dolphin at the @entity16 and star of the movie ' @entity18 ' , that uses a prosthetic tail			1
it was something the water baby could relate with			0
after losing both his legs to meningitis when he was just one , @entity10 also uses custom - made prosthetic flippers to swim			1
@entity10 was obsessed with @entity14 after seeing her in the movie ' @entity18 ' beautiful : before they swam together earlier this month , double amputee @entity10 , 8 , was inspired by @entity14 the tail-less dolphin who learned to swim with a prosthetic tail ' his first words when he saw the film was , ' @entity14 's disabled just like me , ' said @entity10 's father , @entity39			1
' there are some pretty raw feelings that go into seeing @entity10 swim with the dolphin			2
' the family , from @entity44 , in @entity45 , kept the trip a secret from the boy until august 16th when they were on the flight to @entity11			2
the flight attendants announced the trip was a surprise visit to @entity14 's home , organised by local tourism officials at @entity55 / @entity16			1
@entity10 's dream had come true			2
on the day of his swim , trainer @entity57 urged @entity10 to tap @entity14 , the signal to raise her tail			1
' you guys are best friends now , ' @entity57 told @entity10 , whose smile grew wider			0
he then held onto @entity14 's fin and swam beside her , swimming in circles and backward for several laps			1
for more than an hour , winter and @entity10 - at first alone with the trainer , then joined by his five - year - old sister , @entity70 , and @entity71 - swam in the tank			0
@entity10 's stepmother , @entity73 , 29 , told @entity74 : ' i think he was in shock when he found out he could swim with her			2
' he thought he would only be able to meet her - he was just the second visitor to be allowed to swim with her as well			0
@entity10 held onto @entity14 's fin and swam beside her , swimming in circles for more than an hour			1
his sister , @entity80 , five , also swam with winter @entity10 's stepmother @entity73 , 29 , told @entity74 : ' i think he was in shock when he found out he could swim with her			1
' @entity10 is pictured feeding winter ' it was so overwhelming			0
he had dreamed of it for so long			0
' she added : ' on the film he saw himself in the dolphin			0
he can swim like her			0
' he felt like he was like @entity14			0
he had never seen an injured animal like that before			0
' he said that she was his friend , he identified with her			0
@entity14 lost her tail in a an accident involving a crab trap			0
she was fitted with a prosthetic by staff at @entity16			0
@entity10 felt he could associate with her because her tail is like his prosthetic flippers @entity10 's stepmother said that he views @entity14 as a friend and that it is now his ambition to go back to @entity11 to work with her ' there is a massive bond			1
you could see the way they were in the water together - they were very calm together			0
' since we got back he is calmer and more content in himself			0
his dream job is now to go back and look after @entity14 - he no longer wants to be a train driver ! ' @entity10 said he was @entity14 's biggest fan and he could have swum with the dolphin ' for a million hours '			1
dream come true : @entity10 sits with @entity14 the tail-less dolphin ( left ) and @entity118 in the dolphin 's tank at the @entity16 after swimming with winter a family affair : @entity10 , 8 , with his father @entity123 , stepmother @entity124 , his siblings and @entity14 the dolphin at @entity16 , in @entity16 , @entity11 ' it was greater than great , ' he said after his swim			1
planning for the visit took about a year , during which @entity10 's parents struggled to keep the process a secret			2
@entity10 was just hours from death after he was struck down with meningitis as a baby			2
despite pulling through he had to have both legs amputated below the knee and also lost the tips of most of his fingers			0
tragic : @entity10 's legs were amputated and he lost his fingertips after contracting meningococcal septicaemia when he was one			1
before his parents bought him a new pair of limbs , he was given prosthetics on the @entity148 but they did n't fit properly he was later fitted with false legs and given a wheelchair to help him get around but he desperately wanted to swim with his friends			1
that 's when his father @entity123 and stepmother @entity124 spent months fundraising on his behalf			0
they raised enough money to pay for a custom - made pair of legs that could be used in water			2
@entity161 at the @entity163 branch of the @entity164 also made him a pair of flippers that attach to the ends of the feet			0
making a splash : @entity10 struggled to balance in the water before he was fitted with new limbs			1
his step - mum @entity124 and dad @entity123 raised $ 18,600 to buy him legs that fit and can be worn all day @entity173 : @entity10 is now speedy in the swimming pool thanks to his new prosthetic legs and custom - made flippers ' @entity10 loves swimming and has been having swimming lessons for just over a year but he could n't propel himself through the water or stay afloat as easily as everyone else , ' @entity124 said			1
' as soon as @entity10 first wore the flippers it was incredible the speed he could travel through the water , his instructor even had to swim with him to keep up			1
' we want @entity10 to see that even though his legs were taken away by his meningitis he can still follow his dreams and be like his friends , just sometimes we have to make slight adaptations to aid him along the way			2
