the president said he felt ' terrible ' that captains @entity7 and @entity8 were forced to move their big day because of his vacation plans at the @entity11			1
@entity0 , speaking to the couple just after their said their vows , crackled over an @entity16 loudspeaker , saying he would have skipped the 16th hole if anybody had told him there was a wedding going on - and joked he would have come away with a better score , too			1
if they had just mentioned that they were going to have a wedding on the 16th hole , we would have skipped the 16th hole			1
' @entity0 later said that this would have improved his score - an 84 - by six strokes , giving him a 79			2
the gracious couple described the move as a ' blessing in disguise ' because of the better view from their new spot			1
they told the president how they met while posted in @entity62 in 2011 - then cheekily invited him to their wedding reception			2
but @entity0 declined , saying that his inescapable security detail would be a downer at the party			0

sorry : army captains @entity7 and @entity8 planned to get married at the 16th tee box of the @entity79 on sunday , but had to move their ceremony at the last minute because president @entity0 wanted to play the course			1
pictured above speaking to the president on the phone when he later called to apologize ironically , the couple knew the president would be in town and sent him an invite on a whim , and received a polite decline just hours before they learned they could no longer get married at their desired location			1
