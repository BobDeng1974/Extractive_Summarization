more than half of teenagers and people in their early 20s say they have been victims of some form of online bullying , taunts or harassment			1
an @entity9 poll has discovered that 56 per cent have been targeted through various methods including a third who have fallen foul of ' sexting ' - the sharing of risqué personal videos or images			1
as many as 40 per cent have even faced some form of abuse from their partners on computers or with mobile phones			1
harassment : as young people spend more time on the internet , the number that report being bullied continues to rise with more time being spent on the internet , there has been a significant increase in online bullying of 14 to 24 - year - olds - a rise of 10 per cent in just two years			1
in some of the most tragic cases , vicious taunts have led to suicides			0
yesterday @entity38 senator @entity37 introduced a new ' cyber-bullying ' bill saying outdated pre-digital harassment laws fail to punish bullies who use the internet and mobile phones to torment others			1
tragic : @entity46 , 14 , killed himself after falling victim to online bullies			1
a poll found 56 per cent of @entity52 youth had been taunted online he argued that current state law had failed to keep up with modern technology and people spending more time online			1
' if people know there is a tough law on the books and they 're going to be punished , they are going to act accordingly , ' he said			1
at least 30 states have laws dealing with online harassment and five specifically for cyber-bullying			1
mr @entity37 's bill would mean that stalking laws would be updated to include harassing a child using electronic communication			2
although it is already a crime to ' intentionally cause or aid ' another person 's suicide , the bill would update the state 's second - degree manslaughter statute to explicitly include cyber-bullying as a possible cause of such a suicide			1
at the weekend , @entity81 sang a tribute to 14 - year - old @entity46 who apparently killed himself after sending her a thank - you message on @entity86			2
he had suffered from homophobic online bullying for more than a year and wrote a blog about trouble he got at school			2
among the anonymous posting was one that said ' @entity95 , @entity96			0
he must die ! ' proportion of people who say they have been bullied online : 56 % rise since 2009 : 10 % number who say the internet is a shield for bullies : 75 % those aged 14 - 17 who have ' sexted ' : 8 % those aged 18 - 24 who have sexted : 14 % proportion who have been abused online by partner : 14 % @entity106 - @entity9 poll of 1,355 people aged 14 - 24 police have launched an investigation to decide whether to bring charges and believe that three fellow students may have been involved			1
while many forms of online bullying decline as teens go through school , homophobic abuse remains the same throughout			2
@entity120 , 22 , said that she became a victim of internet harassment when she was 12 and in 7th grade before she had even ventured onto the internet			1

' i thought he 'd just see it once and then delete it , like i had deleted it			0
' three - quarters of young people believe that bullies use the internet because they are too cowardly to confront their victim face to face			1
false rumours and sharing other people 's private messages are among the more common forms of bullying while logging onto someone else 's account and spying on them are also popular			2
nearly a fifth of young people said that someone else had posted embarrassing pictures or video of them online without their permission			1
@entity165 : the number of incidents of ' sexting ' - sending lewd images - has not increased thanks to high profile cases like that of former congressman , @entity173 researchers have found that many of those who bully on the internet do the same in real life			2
@entity179 , from @entity180 , said : ' we are seeing offenders who are just jerks to people online and offline			1
' when i was bullied in middle school i could go home and slam my door and forget about it for a while			2
these kids can be accessed around the clock through technology			0
there 's really no escape			0
' despite the significant rises in other forms of bullying , sexting has shown little increase			0
it is believed that this is because people are thinking twice about sending photographs of themselves			2
a major deterrent has been high - profile cases including that of former senator @entity173 who stood down from @entity209 after posting a risqué picture of himself on @entity86			0
eight per cent of those aged 14 to 17 said they had shared a naked picture of themselves ; among 18 to 24 years old , it was 14 per cent			1
but almost a quarter of the younger group said they 'd been exposed to sexting in some way , including seeing images someone else was showing around			0
and 37 per cent of the young adults had some experience with ' sexting ' images			0
many young people do n't take sexting seriously , despite the potential consequences			0
