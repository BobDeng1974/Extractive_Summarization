by @entity0 published : 16:05 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 16:05 est , 3 may 2013 an adviser to the @entity2 has broken ranks to reject one of its most contentious conclusions : that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects			1
@entity10 said that although it was wrong for the police to brief against suspects to ‘ pressure or punish ’ , it was ‘ equally chilling ’ for officers to refuse to name someone they have detained or charged			1
she also condemned a ‘ blanket policy of arresting people in secret ’			1
outspoken : @entity10 rejected one of @entity23 's key conclusions that police should keep secret arrests of criminal suspects findings : @entity23 's report into press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied , ' the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the @entity35 or public ' @entity23 ’s report into press standards concluded that unless some exceptional circumstance applied , ‘ the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the @entity35 or public ’			1
but yesterday miss @entity10 , the director of @entity46 , the civil liberties and human rights campaign group , said : ‘ police briefing against arrested individuals to pressure or punish is clearly abusive but it ’s equally chilling for officers to refuse to confirm names of those detained or charged			1
‘ aggressively volunteering suspects ’ identities is one thing , a blanket policy of arresting people in secret , without the knowledge of @entity35 and public , is quite another			1
‘ clearer guidance to forces is plainly required but all the rules and policies in the world are no substitute for a deeper understanding of the sensitive use of discretion to protect the public including vulnerable suspects			1
’ her comments will fuel the growing backlash against police plans for draconian restrictions on what information they release			2
within weeks , senior officers will publish new rules barring forces from identifying anyone who has been arrested , which has horrified free speech campaigners			2
yesterday a @entity83 survey revealed that 14 of the 43 police forces in @entity85 and @entity86 are keeping secret the names of suspects even after they have been charged			1
publicity : on thursday it emerged that @entity94 sexual predator @entity92 might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime fears over the influence of @entity23 on police secrecy were raised on wednesday when one force announced it would no longer name suspects it had charged with a criminal offence			2
the @entity105 force made the announcement in a footnote to a press release revealing that one of its own former officers had been charged with stealing more than £ 100,000			0
on thursday the force reversed its position			0
secret sentence : the @entity83 revealed the case of @entity116 , who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80 - year - old father @entity118 out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger critics say secret arrests are the hallmark of authoritarian countries			1
on thursday it emerged that @entity94 sexual predator @entity92 might never have been brought to justice under the proposed new secrecy regime			0
publicity surrounding his arrest in december led to more than a dozen other victims coming forward			0
if they had not added their complaints , the case might have collapsed for lack of evidence			0
after his arrest , @entity92 , 83 , declared his innocence and invoked @entity23 to complain about ‘ systematic leaks to the media ’			0
the country ’s most senior judge yesterday instructed his colleagues that they must never again send anybody to prison in secret			2
lord judge , the lord chief justice , said it was a ‘ fundamental principle ’ that people jailed for contempt of court should be sentenced in public			0
he warned judges : ‘ this is mandatory			0
there are no exceptions ’			0
the ‘ important guidance ’ from lord judge – backed by the chief family courts judge sir @entity163 – came ten days after the @entity83 revealed the case of @entity116 , who was imprisoned for five months for contempt after trying to get her 80 - year - old father @entity118 out of a care home where his family believed he was in danger			2
the hearing of the @entity165 at which @entity166 , 50 , was sentenced was effectively secret .			0
