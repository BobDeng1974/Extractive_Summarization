by @entity1 reporter published : 07:52 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 07:52 est , 10 january 2014 this adorable arctic fox curled up into a tiny ball to shelter from a bitterly cold snow blizzard			1
the adult male knew exactly what to do to protect himself from the freezing winds howling across the immaculately white terrain			2
he found a spot to hide behind a rock , made himself as small as possible and wrapped his thick tail around him for maximum warmth			1
complete camouflage : the arctic fox curls up into a ball to protect himself from the snow and wind wildlife photographer @entity20 , 42 , described seeing the exquisite mammals in the wild as one of his best wildlife encounters to date			1
he and a group of friends hired a jeep to explore the tundra wilderness of @entity29 , @entity30 , on a ten - day trip			1
mr @entity20 said : ‘ we spotted the sleeping fox in some particularly extreme weather conditions			2
‘ there was a snow blizzard , high winds and low visibility			2
at times like these the foxes will shelter behind a rock on a snow ridge for maximum protection , and that 's exactly what he had done			1
what does the fox say ? when the wind had calmed , the male adult was ready for new adventures in @entity29 , @entity30 doing a runner : the fix was spotted running over the tundra in the hunt for fun and food ‘ he knew to get out of the wind and basically use that wonderful luxurious tail as a barrier against the cold			1
’ mr @entity20 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , had photographed arctic foxes in captivity before but never in the wild so was delighted to see them up close			0
mr @entity20 said : ‘ @entity68 foxes are the holy grail for many wildlife photographers because they are normally shy and elusive			0
’ ‘ they 're usually quite scarce but every few years , an abundance of prey boosts their numbers			0
‘ luckily thanks to a boom in the lemming population , they have had a good breeding year and we found over 20 of these beautiful foxes over the course of the trip			0
' no fear : @entity68 foxes are normally shy and hard to capture , but @entity83 managed to see more than one on his trip the species , also known as polar fox or snow fox , is well equipped with dealing with the cold ‘ at times they were only a few metres away from us , even running around our feet			1
‘ it was a magical experience - probably at the top of my list of special photography moments			0
‘ i never could have dreamt we would have had such an amazing opportunity			0
’ the arctic fox , also known as snow fox or polar fox , is well equipped to deal with the freezing temperatures thanks to its thick fur and high level of body fat compared to other types of foxes			0
as the snow melts in the spring , the fox sheds it 's white coat for a brown one , in order to help in camouflage itself from its enemies and help it sneak up on its prey unnoticed .			0
