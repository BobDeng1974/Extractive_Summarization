the two sisters were driving home from work when their care went off the road and *hit* a pole
@entity8 and @entity9 were *inseparable* , like ' yin and yang , ' one friend recalled
drugs or alcohol were not a factor in the crash , authorities determined
neither woman was wearing a seatbelt , which friends say is not like them
one friend suspects a deer ran in front of their car , causing the women to veer off the road
