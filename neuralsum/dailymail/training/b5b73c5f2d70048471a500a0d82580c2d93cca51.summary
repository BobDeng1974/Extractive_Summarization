@entity1 manager @entity0 has hailed @entity2 as one of his all - time great buys after watching the @entity5 again make his mark on the @entity7			1
the @entity8 paid just £ 3million in the summer for striker @entity2 , who has previously played for such illustrious names as @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
although the 24 - year - old took time to find his feet , he has quickly learned how to adapt in @entity18 football ’s top flight , and as @entity0 noted @entity1 are now “ reaping the benefits ”			1
@entity2 ( right ) celebrates with team - mate @entity20 after scoring the winner for @entity1 at the @entity24 , @entity2 ’s 63rd - minute shot - on - the - turn in a 1 - 0 victory lit up a drab midlands derby , ending the @entity26 ’ four - game unbeaten run and keeping them rooted to the foot of the table			1
“ it was a good , well - worked goal , and no more than we deserved as i felt in general play we were the more creative team , ” said @entity0			1
“ defensively we were rock solid			2
in fairness we did n’t have to deal with too much because ahead of them the midfield nipped things in the bud and did n’t allow @entity40 to gain momentum in the game			1
” as for the inspirational @entity2 , a delighted @entity0 remarked : “ he ’s getting better every game			1
“ the @entity7 is a strong league , and he understood that when he came , but initially he was taken aback by it			2
@entity2 battles for the ball with @entity40 's @entity47 during saturday 's game “ but he has learned very quickly , he is an intelligent player , and a very talented one as well			1
“ we ’ve had to wait a little bit , but now he is up to speed and he is enjoying being part of a good team , one that looks to involve him and recognises the ability he has			2
“ he is thriving in this environment after feeling a little unwanted over the past two or three years , being on the edges of teams he has been involved with , but that ’s not the case with him here			2
“ obviously he is an outstanding player , but i ’ve also been really impressed with his personality			2
“ given his career path some players ’ heads would have been turned , but he is very level , he has great humility , is a good professional and we ’re really pleased with him			0
” suggested @entity2 has become one of his better acquisitions , @entity0 concurred , adding : “ he is up there			1
“ the money we paid for him takes people aback i would suggest given some of the figures bandied about for other players			0
@entity2 is sandwiched between @entity40 duo @entity78 ( left ) and @entity47 ( right ) “ if you look at what we ’ve got for the money we ’ve paid then we have done really well			1
” after three wins and a draw in their previous four matches , by boss @entity84 ’s own admission his @entity40 side were flat , with new signing @entity88 given little to work with following his introduction two minutes after @entity2 ’s strike			1
“ it was a tight game settled by one moment of stand - out quality , and we failed to create the chances we had in previous games at home , ” said @entity84			0
the home side ’s best player on view was @entity101 , seemingly a surprise given his recent withdrawal from @entity106 ’s @entity105 squad with a knee injury			0
on the day of the tournament starting , @entity101 was creative and a thorn in the side of @entity1 right - back @entity111			2
quizzed on @entity101 ’s inclusion , @entity84 took umbrage as he said : “ we said he would be out for 10 days to two weeks and that ’s the case			0
“ i do n’t see how it ( him playing ) is a surprise			0
i did n’t pull him out of anything			0
“ he had scans here and was advised not to fly because of the swelling and then he went down to @entity124 to have an independent medical that was organised by the @entity127 @entity126 , and they came to the same conclusion as we did			0
“ they decided not to include him in their squad			0
if they ’ve any problems then they need to look at their own administrators			0
it ’s nothing to do with me			0
“ what the @entity127 @entity126 decide to do in terms of making statements , how their administrators operate or comments the managers want to make , it ’s entirely up to them , but quite frankly i could n’t care less about that			0
