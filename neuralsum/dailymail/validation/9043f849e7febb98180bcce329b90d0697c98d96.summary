@entity0 , the secretive augmented reality glasses start - up , has provided a rare glimpse into the capabilities of its technology			1
the company , who received $ 542 million ( £ 352 million ) in funding by @entity10 , today released a video that showcases its augmented reality graphics in a real - life setting			1
titled ' just another day in the office of @entity0 ' , the clip shows an office worker scrolling down his email inbox , which appears in front of him as a hologram			1
after clicking on a video game icon , a game automatically loads and the user is placed in a virtual reality game setting instantly			1
he then picks up a real toy ray gun and uses it against an army of virtual reality invading robots			2
the video ends with the logos of @entity0 and @entity38 , the special effects team behind movies like ' @entity41 '			1
he then opens up a series of holographic folders in front of him using hand gestures.after clicking on a video game icon , a game automatically loads and the user is placed in a virtual reality game setting instantly			1
the @entity53 - based company was meant to show at the @entity55 conference in @entity56 , @entity57 , this week , but mysteriously cancelled its appearance			0
its system is currently one of the most highly - anticipated , and secretive , virtual reality glasses in development			1
last month , the company revealed some details about its augmented reality glasses - although it appears the technology still needs a full trolley of parts to work			1
the 3d system operates by shining images on the retina , creating an augmented reality which combines fictional characters with the real world			2
the @entity0 user then picks up a toy ray gun and uses it against an army of virtual reality invading robots the @entity53 - based company was meant to show at the @entity55 conference in @entity56 , @entity57 , this week , but mysteriously cancelled its appearance			1
its system is currently one of the most highly - anticipated , and secretive , virtual reality glasses in development			1
pictured is a scene from the video until now , very few details about the @entity53 - based technology had been revealed			1
@entity85 , writing for @entity87 , was able to test out one of the larger systems			0
the patent shows that , in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles @entity85 , writing for @entity87 , was able to test out one of the larger systems which will compete with the likes of @entity98 's @entity97 and @entity100 's @entity99			1
' @entity0 had to come up with an alternative to stereoscopic @entity102 – something that does n't disrupt the way you normally see things , ' she wrote			1
' as i see crisply rendered images of monsters , robots , and cadaver heads in @entity0 's offices , i can envision someday having a video chat with faraway family members who look as if they 're actually sitting in my living room while , on their end , i appear to be sitting in theirs			1
' or walking around @entity122 with a virtual tour guide , the sides of buildings overlaid with images that reveal how the structures looked in the past			0
' @entity0 's @entity53 - based makers said it is a realistic version of virtual and augmented reality , which it calls ' cinematic reality '			1
the firm 's website features an elephant ( pictured ) moving realistically in a person 's hands sensors can track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible			0
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example			0
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select and back she says the experience is like ' watching movies where the characters appear to be right in front of me , letting me follow them around as the plot unfolds			0
' in october , @entity0 announced it had raised $ 542 million in funding , led by @entity10			1
other investors included @entity159 , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , @entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164			0
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive @entity166 , and was awarded earlier this week			2
in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles , connected to a battery pack			2
it connects to a network , which then connects to a so - called ' passable world model			0
' this model is created using a database of objects and ' object recognisers '			0
sensors can also track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible			0
buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example			0
while other sensors could recognise finger commands such as focus , copy , select , back or cancel , and right clicks			0
in one drawing from the patent , a mother and child are in a supermarket , and a virtual version of their list appears on the trolley			2
other drawings show a man watching sport on this tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him			0
the company appears to be aiming to fit its technology into a chunky pair of sports sunglasses wired to a square pack that users can place in their pocket			2
but the prototype that ms @entity223 used was fixed on ' unwieldy scaffolding '			0
the company wo n't say how it will shrink its device , but chief executive @entity166 has confirmed that the headset will be a glasses - like system			1
despite the secrecy surrounding the system , it has been deemed exciting enough for @entity10 to have invested around $ 500 million			1
other investors included @entity159 , the world 's leading phone chipmaker , @entity162 , @entity163 , and @entity164			0
in january , an extensive patent not only showed how the augmented reality headset could look and work , it also provides a number of example uses			1
the patent was filed in july 2014 by chief executive @entity166 , and was awarded earlier this week			2
it features a total of 180 pages and drawings detailing the look , functionality and uses for the device			0
in terms of design , the headset resembles skiing goggles , connected to a battery pack			2
the headset connects to a network , which then connects to a so - called ' passable world model			2
' this model is created using a database of objects and ' object recognisers '			0
sensors can also track the wearer 's location and position , to make sure images are overlaid on the real world as accurately as possible , with the correct depth and proportions			0
further into the patent , a number of case uses are shown in the form of drawings			0
one shows a man watching sport on tv , with scores , player ratings and other related content appearing on virtual menus in front of him an example image , showing the blurring of a fantastical virtual reality object and the real world produced by the technology , is pictured			2
as part of @entity10 's investment , @entity287 , senior vice president of @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 at the search engine , will join @entity0 's board buttons on the visor could act like a ' home screen ' , to take wearers to menus , for example			1

mr @entity166 recently said : ' we have the term ' cinematic reality ' because we are disassociated with those things			0
' when you see this , you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years			0
' to go farther and deeper than we 're going , you would be changing what it means to be human			0
' the soon - to - be defunct @entity316 , already lets users see augmented reality			0
using a particular app for example , runners can wear the glasses to see monsters chasing them			0
the @entity0 patent shows how its headset could be used in a similar way by cyclists , for example			1
@entity316 also superimposes information on the periphery of a wearer 's vision			0
@entity98 spent $ 2 billion buying @entity333 last year , which makes a virtual reality headset , mostly aimed at gamers			2
unlike @entity0 's future device , it blocks out the real world around the user			2
gamers hope @entity98 and @entity10 's involvement in the virtual reality space will accelerate the technology , which would make playing games and watching films more realistic , as well as creating other immersive experiences			1
a release date and price for the @entity0 headset have not been revealed			1
@entity0 's system claims to be more realistic than the @entity97 ( pictured )			1
the firm was bought last year by @entity98 for $ 2 billion , and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the headset to be launched while it is not clear exactly what form the technology will take , it could be added to future versions of smart glasses ( @entity316 pictured )			1
a release date and price for the headset have not been revealed			2

the short video is titled ' just another day in the office of @entity0 '
it shows an office worker using the glasses to look through emails
he chooses a ' game ' option and the office is filled with *killer* robots
@entity10 recently led a $ 542 million investment into @entity0 system
until now , very few details about the technology had been revealed
a patent in january shows how the headset could *potentially* work
