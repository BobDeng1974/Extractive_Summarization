' researchers sampled over 10,000 people between the ages of 16 to 64			0
@entity69 the affair between characters @entity68 and @entity70 has created some of the show 's sexiest scenes			2
the former lovers were seen meeting for secret sex sessions all over @entity105 , with the chance of getting caught seemingly only serving to increase the passion			0
sharing a steamy embrace with her estranged husband , @entity70 's new husband almost catches them in the act at the car lot where @entity70 rips off her clothes and @entity68 pulls down his trousers			0
but the pair manage to go undetected and ultimately , the affair lasts much of the summer			0
@entity117 , @entity118 the 1976 historical drama from the @entity86 charting the lives of the @entity122 emperors was ahead of its time when it came to the shocking sex scene where @entity118 ' insatiable wife @entity125 challenges a representative of the @entity127 into a whore - off to see who can sleep with the most men			2
eventually the call girl staggers out in a disheveled state while @entity133 continues and merrily shouts ' come back you whore ! we have n't finished ! ' tipping the velvet an uncensored @entity86 adaptation of @entity139 's love story between young woman @entity140 and a male impersonator @entity142			0

not the hottest of @entity2 sex scenes but surely one of the funniest			1
@entity27 it may be set in the 1920s but that has n't stopped @entity27 having plenty of salacious moments			0
