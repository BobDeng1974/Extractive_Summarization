fast food restaurants are no strangers to criticism but being blasted for a lack of choice is not one of them			0
however , never let it be said that they do n't cover their backs , with bosses coming up with a way to satisfy the neediest of customers a long time ago			0
for people unable to find a calorific fix in the regular choices , those in the know can take their pick from a rather special secret menu , and thanks to website @entity22 , less informed fast food lovers can now enjoy the same off - the - track treats			1
the items listed in the site 's directory include both the officially unofficial creations of the restaurant 's themselves and also @entity44 inventions you can either make yourself , by combining several conventional orders , or convince a particularly game cashier to whip up			1
a spokeswoman for @entity32 denied having a secret menu and said ' our restaurants are committed to providing our guests with choice , and all customers are able to customize their order , by adding ingredients to our menu offerings			1
' @entity34 claimed the same			0
a spokeswoman for the brand said : ' all @entity34 stores are independently owned and operated by franchisees			0
whilst we only have one core menu , the @entity34 brand prides itself on offering choice to customers so that they can have their @entity67 made the way they like it			0
' @entity32 the @entity72 the menu lists eight under - the - radar treats for @entity32 but , at a fast food joint famed for its liberal use of cheese and bacon , the @entity71 is the stand out , with its four beef burgers , four slices of cheese and four rashers of bacon crammed between two buns			1
the site claims the burger is available at all outlets - although sometimes under the name @entity88 - for $ 3.99			1
however , in the event that a cashier stares blankly after receiving the order , customers are advised to simply describe it ingredient by ingredient			2
the @entity71 - sometimes called the @entity88 - is available at @entity32 across the @entity37 the @entity98 because someone does n't eat meat , that does n't mean they do n't want to cram their face with insane amounts of food			1
it goes with the name that @entity32 has a carnivorous bent to its offerings , but with its @entity110 - the whopper - bosses obviously did n't want vegetarians to miss out			2
to this end , the @entity32 secret menu contains a veggie - friendly version of the flagship burger , with the normal beef patty replaced with a non-meat alternative			1
@entity118 - less a new dish for culinary adventurers and more something for people who ca n't make decisions			2
this best - of - both - worlds alternative to chips sees half the fries dumped out of the carton and replaced with a side of onion rings			2
simple but effective , hack the menu describes @entity118 as ' the cherry on top of the @entity130 '			0
@entity33 the @entity135 - perhaps more aptly called the @entity136 , this gut stretching creation is simply a normal @entity135 - but with six extra beef patties shoved in			1
according to the @entity140 the menu team , the burger is ' enough to satisfy a few people with hearty appetites or one hungry lumberjack ' and can be ordered from any @entity33 for $ 6.49			1
. or the @entity136 : gut - stretching creation is a @entity135 with six extra patties shoved in @entity147 floats are a highlight of everyone 's childhood and this secret order from @entity33 allows you to update it for adulthood - by exchanging your soft drink of choice for root beer			1
while obviously confined to those outlets which serve root beer , for only $ 1.99 , it 's a ' refreshing ' desert to a @entity135 @entity162 - while fluorescent green is not usually the colour of choice for a tasty treat , that is the shade for this 50/50 mix of chocolate and shamrock milkshakes			1
only on offer in march - due to the availability of @entity172 - you will have to wait another year for what hack the menu calls ' the most famous ' of @entity33 ' secret offerings			1
@entity176 @entity177 - not quite as illicit as the @entity180 drug but this drink is still a wink - wink , nudge - nudge purchase			2
this customer - invented beverage is supposedly ' one of the most intense drinks you can get , it 's guaranteed to shock your system '			1
made up of four shots of espresso , four pumps of white chocolate syrup , ice and milk , the site suggests showing this recipe to your local barista as a how - to - guide			2
its @entity44 nature means there is no fixed price but the website said it should be standard for whatever size you order			2
' one of the most intense drinks you can get ' : made up of four shots of espresso , four pumps of white chocolate syrup , ice and milk @entity209 and chocolate , the two must haves for the harried officer worker rushing about their day			0
to that end , some @entity176 customers have come up with a new way of combining the two to make that commute even more efficient			0
made by mixing a @entity219 with two pumps of caramel syrup , two pumps hazelnut syrup , java chips and caramel and mocha drizzle , customers will need to show his recipe to their cashier for a hope of walking away with the treat			0
three @entity232 , ask your barista to add one pump of caramel syrup and two pumps chocolate syrup to your @entity239			0
hack the menu is a big fan , claiming : ' in our opinion , the @entity243 's latte from @entity176 ' secret menu is the perfect cinnamon drink			0
' subway @entity249 - while briefly on the main menu during 2012 , the @entity249 has disappeared off the advertising boards to become a stalwart on the secret menu			2
essentially two @entity255 stacked on top of each other , it 's a product best aimed at the particularly hungry			0
the price is variable between outlets , but @entity25 assures readers the ' taste sensation ' is more than worth it			0
old @entity266 in any way a new dish , it is , in fact , the old way @entity34 used to cut their sandwiches			0
at some point over the last decade , the policy somehow changed from cutting down from the top to cutting in from the side			0
the @entity274 the menu team suggest finding an artisan familiar with the old style as a top - down cut somehow helps the sandwich hold onto the ingredients better			2
wing effect - again a change in presentation rather than content			0
this is for people who like to go at their sandwich one ingredient at a time			0
simply ask your sandwich maker to leave the meat closer to the edge of the bread , so it hangs out the side , and voila - wing effect			1
@entity35 @entity295 for an @entity37 audience , the @entity293 is a riff on the infamous @entity297 , which was released in @entity37 outlets in 2010			1
it is a double - decker egg , bacon and cheese sandwich , but , instead of bread , the filling is sandwiched between fried chicken			1
hack the menu warns : ' not too many people are willing to try something this big , but do n't be afraid to ask them for this behemoth if you 're really hungry '			0
while the @entity297 is no longer available , the @entity140 the menu team assure readers that if they ask nicely , its larger cousin can still be whipped up ( for a variable cost )			0
even though the @entity297 has been taken off the menu , the @entity293 is supposedly still available @entity316 favourite in @entity317 , some @entity37 branches will also whip up customers a portion			1
simply a portion of fries covered in cheese and gravy , all outlets should have the requisite ingredients for other dishes and are happy to help out a curious customer			1
in - @entity328 @entity329 covered in onions , pickles and melted cheese - animal style fries are so popular they may as well appear on the regular menu			2
' pure goodness ' according to @entity274			0
@entity335 are the most popular item on the @entity338 secret menu @entity339 quesarito - supposedly the ' @entity341 ' of the @entity344 restaurant 's secret menu , this is a burrito where , instead of a normal wrap , the fillings are packed into two tortillas fused together by melted cheese			1
hack the menu says : ' without a doubt , eating the @entity350 is a life changer '			0
the @entity350 is a ' life changer ' according to the @entity140 the menu team @entity176 is one of the fast food joints to boast a secret menu for in - the - know customers @entity33 's secret menu includes the eight burger high @entity135 , for those who dare take it on @entity35 's @entity293 replaces the bread in a double - decker bacon , egg and cheese sandwich with fried chicken @entity32 's eight secret menu items include the worryingly named @entity71			1
