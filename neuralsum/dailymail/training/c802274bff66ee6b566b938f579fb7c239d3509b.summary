by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:45 est , 10 may 2012 updated : 02:35 est , 11 may 2012 militant union leaders once again failed in their campaign to bring disruption to @entity6 after yesterday ’s strikes were dismissed as a damp squib			0
they were expecting around 400,000 public sector workers to join the latest wave of strikes and protests over pension reforms			1
but ministers said the real figure was dramatically lower at 100,000 – down from the 146,000 who took part in last year ’s walkout			0
anger : some 20,000 off - duty officers from all 43 forces across @entity22 and @entity23 are expected to take part in the first police march in the capital for more than four years solidarity : 16,000 off - duty officers donned black caps representing each officer expected to be lost under the government 's cull as a result of budget cuts			1
cabinet office minister @entity35 said the action had been futile because nearly all the key public services remained ‘ open as usual ’			1
there was minimal disruption of the health service , border checks continued to operate smoothly , jobcentres remained open , courts were sitting and driving tests went ahead			0
bosses at @entity46 said queues at immigration were ‘ better than normal ’ , despite action by passport control officers			1
contingency plans to replace them with volunteers not only averted chaos , but improved efficiency			0
mr @entity35 said only nine jobcentres out of 700 had closed around the country while only four out of 407 operational courts and 97 tribunals had been affected			2
opposition : cabinet office minister @entity35 described the strike as ' futile ' and insisted that talks over pensions will not be reopened the @entity63 confirmed ‘ less than ’ one per cent of the @entity67 staff who had been expected to turn up for work yesterday did not – and that included those who were off sick			1
one of the court cases to fall victim to the strike was a triple murder trial at @entity73 after two out of the three defendants failed to be produced by the @entity75			1
judge mr @entity76 had to apologise to jurors who had turned up expecting to hear further evidence about the case involving the deaths of three generations of one family in an arson attack on their home in @entity86 , @entity87			0
one of those who died was mr @entity90 's estranged wife @entity89 ( pictured together on their wedding day )			0
the judge told the jury : ' your eagle eye would see that the defendants are rather sparsely populated			0
' the reason is , because of industrial action , two male defendants have not been released by the @entity75 to the transport service to bring them here			0
' i have ordered that they be brought here			0
the transport is standing by to bring them here			0
the trick is getting them out of the prison to the transport			0
' the two defendants who were not produced were @entity90 , 24 , and @entity110 , 35 , who deny three counts of murder along with @entity113 , 21 , who was brought to court			2
all three also deny two counts of attempted murder			0
a brief spell of unofficial industrial action by prison officers was over by lunchtime and there was no reported disruption to @entity123			1
mr @entity35 said : ‘ the dedicated majority of public sector workers are working normally today and rigorous contingency plans are ensuring that nearly all key public services remain open as usual			1
‘ we can confirm that far fewer civil servants are on strike than in november – with around 100,000 taking part – down from 146,000 last year			1
' nevertheless it is very disappointing that a handful of unions insist on carrying on with futile action which will benefit no one			2
’ @entity138 , director general of the @entity139 , said : ‘ by striking , public sector workers are threatening our economy when we need every bit of growth we can get			0
‘ damaging business and public sector productivity through strikes will only hurt us all			0
’ @entity148 leaders insisted the strike over reforms to generous public sector pensions had been a huge success			2
they claimed 200,000 civil servants , lecturers , health workers , @entity155 staff , immigration , police and prison officers had turned out			1
the @entity159 said there had been solid support for what was the third major walkout by public sector employees in the past six months			0
the unions claim the reforms will leave millions of workers having to pay more into their pensions , retiring later and receiving less			1
but ministers insist the current level of public sector pensions is unfair and unaffordable because people are living longer			0
@entity159 general secretary @entity174 said : ‘ instead of announcing made - up figures to undermine the strike , @entity35 should start meaningful negotiations about public service pensions			1
’ enough is enough : @entity179 union placed this full - page adverts in several national newspapers ahead of the action today prison officers were reported to have walked out of 80 per cent of jails in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity185 , leaving only minimum cover and inmates on lockdown			1
however , they returned to work at lunchtime			0
around 30,000 off - duty police officers marched through @entity191 to protest about changes to pay and conditions			1
officers , who are banned from striking by law , face cuts to overtime and bonus payments , a later retirement age and less lavish pensions			1
police on sit - down strike : police have been banned from striking since 1919 when almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty , causing havoc in @entity209 and @entity210 the last police strike : police strikers sitting on the garden wall at 10 @entity214 in 1919 where a strike deputation was received by prime minister @entity217 @entity219 mp @entity218 said : ‘ the hardliners scream blue murder about reformed pensions that give public sector workers far better deals than the vast majority of people in this country can access			1
’ militant union leaders are secretly urging fuel tanker drivers to reject their latest pay and safety standards deal in a plot to cause a summer of disruption			0
a cabal of firebrands inside the union is pressuring drivers to vote for a strike that will cause forecourts to run dry and are likely to coincide with the @entity240 and @entity241			0
the @entity242 has seen leaflets sent to members urging them to vote against a generous package approved by independent arbitration service @entity246 , even though it meets their demands for a health and safety review			2
police officers across the @entity6 are currently banned from taking strike action or joining a union under the @entity254			1
the ban has been in place since 1919 when the first police act was established following two strikes in @entity210 and @entity209			0
complaining that pay for the average constable in a provincial force was £ 2.75 per week , the same as a street sweeper , almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty			2
their demands included a pay rise , improved war bonuses , extension of pension rights to include policemen 's widows and an allowance for school - aged children			2
then prime minister @entity217 , gave in on pay , but within months the union was crushed and the @entity179 founded			1
it is not a union , but has a statutory responsibility to represent its members - all officers below the rank of superintendent - in all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency			1
the few forms of industrial action police can legally take is a work - to - rule , which could severely hit the service , and withdraw from voluntary posts , such as policing football matches			2
other professions have agreements over strike action but , unlike the police , are not banned by law			2
nurses can legally strike but the @entity300 , which represents two thirds of @entity6 nurses , has a ruling that they should only walk out where it would not affect the wellbeing or interests of patients			2
solidarity : police will join public sector workers today in protest over cuts to pay , pensions and jobs			1

20,000 off - duty police will march over 20 per cent budget cuts and *proposals* for most sweeping reform of pay , pensions and conditions in 30 years
16,000 officers will don black caps for each *colleague* expected to be lost
cabinet office minister @entity35 describes the strike as ' futile '
@entity179 chief : ' we are at our lowest ebb i can *remember* '
civil servants , lecturers , health workers , @entity155 staff , immigration officers and members of the @entity340 will join protests
@entity344 murder trial falls victim to prison guards ' action
government considers court action against prison guards for ' *unlawful* ' walk out
