@entity1 viewers will miss the first 15 minutes of saturday 's game due to broadcasting regulations			2
@entity4 welcome bitter rivals @entity5 to the @entity6 on saturday evening in the first @entity7 of the @entity9 season			1
the clash brings together the two best players in the world , @entity13 and @entity14 , who between them have won the last six @entity17 awards			1
here , @entity19 's columnists and reporters reveal which of the two they consider to be the best			1
this has to be one of the hardest questions anyone has ever asked me ! i was lucky enough to work on both the @entity5 and @entity4 games this week and both players were so good			1
i took my son , who is a big @entity31 fan , to @entity32 just to watch @entity14			1
it ’s a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to watch players of their quality so whenever you get the chance you have to go and watch what they do			2
they are both so different but so good in their own right			2
it ’s like trying to compare @entity45 and @entity46 ! @entity14 delivered another masterclass this week as @entity4 crushed @entity31 at @entity32 @entity14 scored twice against @entity49 ' side to take his goal tally for the season to a staggering 21 @entity14 ( centre ) trains with @entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 the day before @entity7 when @entity13 was at his best two or three years ago , @entity14 was n’t at the level he is at now			1
since then he has got better and better and there ’s no doubt he ’s now eclipsed @entity13			1
at the @entity59 walked more than he ran and i wondered if this truly would be @entity14 ’s time , but against @entity61 on tuesday i sensed a change			1
some of that @entity13 movement and intensity was back and i hope he stays fit			1
it would be fantastic to have a true shoot out between the two where we can all have front row seats			2
i honestly think @entity13 is the greatest footballer i have ever seen in my lifetime – it ’s impossible to compare players across eras – and if you asked me whose ability i ’d rather have , i ’d probably say @entity13			1
some of the things he did at his peak were pieces of absolute genius			2
but what is definitely true is that at the moment , @entity13 and @entity14 are playing a different game to everyone else			1
@entity13 had his best season to date in 2011 - 12 when he scored 73 goals in 60 games for @entity5 @entity88 @entity13			1
in every other era there ’s only ever been one great player at a time – @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96			2
there have always been good players but they were the solo stand - out players			2
now we ’ve got two of them			2
that almost makes them better because they are competing directly against each other for goals			2
they are both match - winners and exceptional players , but i do have a favourite			0
when you look at @entity14 , his numbers and goals are phenomenal			1
but you look at his skill set and it is something that can be developed			0
you have seen his pace , energy , strength in the air and his power all increase			0
his technique has improved and there has been a noticeable development			0
of course he is incredible , but he has made himself the player he is			0
@entity13 showed he is returning to something like his best form as he helped @entity5 to victory over @entity61 with @entity13 , it ’s like he has a @entity132 - given talent			1
you look at videos of him as a kid and he ’s doing all the same things as he is now – beating five or six players and curling it in the corner			0
there ’s also something eye - pleasing about left - footed players			0
you saw it with @entity95 and you see it with @entity13			1
i love the way he runs around the ball to pass it into the corner			0
they are both exceptional players but i just prefer watching @entity13			1
for me , and i 've said it for a few years , @entity13 is the best player i have ever seen play			1
i know he 's had a quiet 12 months by his own standards , but he edges it for me			0
we 're blessed with @entity14 and @entity13 being of the same generation , that they 're both around at the same time			1
this is a golden period			0
these players do n't come along every generation			0
there 's not a lot between them			0
they both get you on the edge of your seat every time they get the ball , both create goals and both score goals			0
i do n't buy it that they have to win a @entity59 or a @entity177 to be considered great players			0
that 's just a title			0
they make the best defenders in the world look ordinary time and time again			0
@entity13 has won three @entity186 trophies with @entity5 , the last of which came in 2011 ( left ) @entity14 celebrates after helping @entity4 win the @entity186 against rivals @entity187 in may @entity14 shows off his boots ahead of the weekend @entity189 @entity14			1
power , pace , edge - of - the - seat adrenaline , football box office			0
he ’s @entity193 , without the benders			0
@entity13 is a beautiful footballer , with balance and mesmerising dribbling skills … but he ’s the second best footballer in the world			1
i like the edge between them , too			0
it makes for ‘ anything you can do , i can do better ’ football at its finest			0
it 's difficult to ignore @entity14 , especially when even @entity208 ca n't fault him			1
he considers him the ultimate professional as well as the ultimate player			0
but i think @entity13 does things with just that little bit more finesse			1
the way he strikes the ball for instance			0
it 's just that tad more pleasing on the eye			0
i also like @entity13 's modesty on and off the field			1
he 's more understated than @entity14 , which again i prefer			1
this is not saying one is better than the other , as i do n’t believe it is right to compare			0
they are two of the greatest footballers to have ever played the game and should be duly appreciated and enjoyed			0
at @entity32 on wednesday , @entity14 was so good he earned a standing ovation from the @entity231			1
but let ’s not forget what @entity13 has done in recent years			1
he is , in a word , a genius			0
best player of a generation bar none			0
@entity14 is the epitome of sports entertainment			1
good - looking , honed physique ( @entity242 take note ) ; a sports marketer 's dream			0
@entity13 , though , is about one thing : football - only football			1
there 's that viral of @entity14 and @entity13 sitting at the @entity252 bash , with the @entity253 flanked by both his and @entity13 's girlfriends and the @entity255 sitting on his lonesome			1
@entity13 gets the crown of the world 's best footballer			2
this photoshop image of @entity14 with both his and @entity13 's girlfriends mocked the difference between the two @entity14 is a sports marketer 's dream with his honed physique and modelling contracts @entity5 next on @entity14 's hit - list @entity267 @entity13			1
one - on - one there is no - one in the world as good as @entity13 , not even @entity14			1
the sheer range of his ability to beat a man from a standing start is what puts him apart			0
yes , @entity14 can head better and is stronger			1
but in terms of doing something special with a football , no - one is more mesmerising than @entity13			2
@entity14 has an extra ingredient to all the other football all - time greats , he is as lethal in the air as he is on the ground , making him impossible to stop			2
but if you are talking preferences , i think @entity13 is an inspirational figure because of his size - or lack of it			2
one of the reasons football is the world game is because anyone can play from five foot nothing upwards			0
to be idolised through pure skill rather than power or celebrity lifestyle in this day and age is amazing			0
so it 's @entity13 for me - just			2
@entity14 is great , too ! @entity300 @entity13			1
maybe not quite at the heights he was a couple of years ago but still the most outrageously gifted footballer of the generation			0
what a delight it is to see him perform			0
@entity13 is for wit , artistry and imagination against pace , muscle and power			2
who does n’t warm to the idea of the scruffy short kids embarrassing the big lumbering oafs with their magical skills ? he offers hope and a reminder that football ’s soul resides in the streets not the gym or the lab , and that it is about the playing for pleasure not posing for fame			0
@entity13 shares a joke with his @entity5 team - mates in training as they prepare for @entity7 @entity13 with former @entity333 defender @entity332 ahead of @entity5 's trip to the @entity6 @entity337 @entity336 - @entity335 @entity13			1
he lacks the incredible athleticism of @entity14 and likewise ca n't do nearly as much in the air			2
by all accounts , @entity14 is the more complete player			2
but , for the same reasons i favour @entity344 over @entity345 , despite @entity344 's vastly inferior head - to - head record , it is because of the elegance of how @entity13 plays			1
@entity14 is magnificent and fast and a brutally effective goalscorer ; @entity13 , at his best , is just as effective and looks better doing it			1
for me , there is nothing more stunning in football than a player slaloming through a crowd and dinking the keeper			0
that is what @entity13 does ( did ? ) better than anyone			2
they are , in my opinion , the best two players of my lifetime and the little man stands a hair taller than @entity14			2
@entity364 ronaldo to call him ' ruthlessly efficient ' is a disservice - he is beautifully and brilliantly efficient , redefining how we evaluate football numbers			0
@entity369 take note : here is a guy with equal talent who has dedicated his life to maximising that ability , stretching the limit of his body and mind			0
@entity13 , of course , is incredible , but @entity14 shades it for his unrelenting genius and hunger to be the very best , season on season			1
like @entity387 's facebook page			0
@entity13 and @entity14 have gone head - to - head in @entity389 since the @entity253 joined @entity4 in 2009 a @entity4 sports shop displays @entity14 and @entity13 replica shirts ahead of the much - anticipated clash			1

@entity4 host @entity5 in the first @entity7 of season on saturday
@entity13 and @entity14 will go head to head at the @entity6
between them they have won the last six @entity17 awards
