here @entity183 look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop			0
@entity187 despite picking up their first win on the road against @entity29 last time out , the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for @entity0			1
with @entity75 , @entity31 and @entity80 still to come to @entity194 , their away form could be the key to ensuring their @entity9 survival			2
@entity197 rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and , with goals also at a premium , tightening up at the back is a must			0
@entity46 failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of @entity208 and @entity209 could make the difference			0
share the goals @entity212 has contributed 50 per cent of @entity0 's goals in the @entity9 and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential @entity217 call - up			1
but @entity2 will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden , especially with the former @entity221 man not having scored in open play since the december win over @entity79			2
@entity224 @entity144 down this may be easier said than done , with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in @entity9 history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches			0
@entity144 's leadership qualities and never - say - die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it , so avoiding suspensions is crucial			0
integrate a squad of egos @entity144 , @entity237 , @entity38			0
none of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts			0
@entity243 and @entity244 have also had high - profile disagreements with managers and @entity2 will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival .			0

@entity0 owner @entity11 has placed his faith in @entity2
head coach @entity2 will be assisted by @entity26 and @entity35
director of football @entity38 will also play a significant role
