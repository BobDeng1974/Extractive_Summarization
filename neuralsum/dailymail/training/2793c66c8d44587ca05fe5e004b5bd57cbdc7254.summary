by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 11:41 est , 24 january 2014 she was the famous beauty who captured the heart of one of the @entity7 's best - loved artists but unlike her contemporary , @entity8 , few remember @entity10 today			1
and yet , the story of @entity10 , later @entity12 , the beautiful stablehand 's daughter who went on to appear in some of the world 's most famous paintings , is just as fascinating			1
now the tale of the model and muse , who died exactly 100 years ago , is the subject of an exhibition at the @entity22 , due to run until may			1
@entity23 : @entity10 proved irresistible to the @entity25 painters , including @entity26 who painted this 1881 portrait @entity28 : a pre-raphaelite @entity23 charts her rags - to - riches journey and includes some of the incredible works of art she appeared in			2
many were by her lover , husband @entity12 ' close friend @entity26 , whose other muse was his wife , the flame - haired @entity8			0
although @entity12 did n't share @entity40 's tawny colouring , she did match her for beauty and frequently appeared as a goddess , whether @entity43 [ @entity43 ] or @entity44 , in @entity26 's work			1
her husband , meanwhile , chose to portray her as @entity51 's famously beautiful - and famously unfaithful - @entity47 in an 1858 painting that also goes by the title @entity50			0
other artists to work with @entity12 included @entity53 , who immortalised her likeness in a succession of stained glass windows , and @entity57 ; one of the few female @entity25 painters			0
beauty : @entity12 as @entity61 , the @entity63 deity , and in @entity26 's @entity64 ( right ) family : @entity10 , second from right , sits between her two daughters and in front of her husband @entity12 the @entity70 were a group of @entity72 artists who formed a ' brotherhood ' in 1848 , dedicated to creating work that rejected the mannered approach adopted by @entity76 and other @entity78 painters			1
believing @entity76 , @entity79 and @entity80 had proven a corrupting influence on art , they wanted to return to the intense colour and detailed compositions that characterised 15th century @entity86 art. founded by @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity26 , the trio later welcomed @entity26 's brother , @entity12 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity90 to their circle			2
so who was @entity10 ? like @entity8 , her rival in both love and art , little is known of her childhood other than that it was poor and deprived			2
born on the 19th october 1839 in @entity101 , @entity12 was the daughter of a stableman , @entity104 , and his laundress wife @entity105			1
although she was undoubtedly beautiful , she seemed destined for a life of obscurity until a chance encounter with a group of artists outside a theatre at the age of 18 changed her life forever			0
@entity53 and @entity26 were in @entity101 to complete work on a mural for @entity116 , then the @entity7 's leading art critic and the @entity117 at @entity118			2
spotting her outside @entity101 's @entity122 theatre , the pair were enraptured by her beauty and @entity12 ' modelling career began			1
@entity12 , for her part , was smitten by @entity26 but he , at the time engaged to @entity8 , did n't reciprocate			0
instead , she became engaged to his friend , @entity12 , whom she met through @entity26 and sat for on several occasions			0
lovers : @entity26 ( left ) and @entity10 , seen in a study for @entity61 , were lovers after the death of @entity8 @entity134 : @entity26 's 1850 work , the @entity136 , includes a depiction of @entity10 ( left ) family : @entity10 's long - suffering husband @entity12 ( left ) and their younger daughter , @entity140 ( may ) the pair married in 1859 and went on to have two daughters , @entity10 and @entity140 , with whom they lived in the beautiful @entity145 on the @entity148 - @entity147 border			1
despite her humble background , the new mrs @entity28 had few problems fitting into upper class society , refining her accent to the point where friends described it as ' queenly ' and later inspiring @entity158 's 1884 novel @entity156 , which in turn inspired the musical and film , @entity161			0
but although she and @entity12 appear to have been happy , @entity26 remained in the background and after @entity8 's death , their affair began in earnest			2
the relationship would last , off and on , until his death in 1882 , and she would go on to star in some of his most famous works			0
after his death , she embarked on an affair with poet and political activist @entity175 that endured until 1894			0
later life : these photographs were taken in 1898 , after she was widowed , at @entity145 he was her last love			0
just two years after her relationship with @entity175 ended , her husband died and @entity10 , left white - haired by the trauma of nursing him through his final illness , would remain alone for the rest of her life			1
she would outlive her husband by 16 years , eventually dying peacefully at the age of 75 in her bed on 26th january 1914 in @entity189			1
@entity23 , model and romantic , @entity10 's death might have been a conventional one but her life was anything but			2
@entity28 : pre-raphaelite @entity23 runs until the 11th may at the @entity22			0

@entity10 was born into a poor @entity101 family in 1839
she married artist @entity12 but embarked on a *series* of affairs
appears in *numerous* painting , among them @entity202 's *magnificent* @entity201
died aged 75 , almost exactly 100 years ago , on the 26th january 1914
