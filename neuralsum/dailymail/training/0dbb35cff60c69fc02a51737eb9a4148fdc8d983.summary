@entity1 leader @entity13 will dismiss criticism by some @entity15 that its key messages are ‘ racist ’ - unveiling another provocative poster focusing on migration from the @entity12			1
featuring an escalator running up the @entity21 , it claims the @entity12 ’s free movement rules means @entity11 has ‘ no border ’ and ‘ no control ’ over incomers			1
it is designed to bring home to the @entity11 public just what membership of the @entity12 means as regards controlling our own borders , ’ the @entity1 leader said			2
‘ the @entity21 have always been seen as symbolic of @entity11 ’s island status			1
that status should give us added ability to pick and choose the people who come to live and work in our country			2
but under @entity12 free movement laws we have no serious control whatever			2
‘ no doubt the political establishment will react again in mock outrage and throw a new round of slurs and smears at @entity1 and at me			2
' we ’ve been called every name under the sun in recent weeks			2
but we will not be silenced , and we know that millions of decent @entity11 people are on our side and are grateful that we are speaking out			2
’ @entity68 , a millionaire @entity70 businessman is funding a £ 1.5 million publicity campaign for @entity1 in the @entity6 elections , said : ‘ this poster goes to the heart of the @entity6 debate			1
@entity13 claims the image is the most powerful yet in the @entity6 debate ahead of the may 22 vote ' over the past 20 years or more , politicians - conservative , @entity81 and @entity82 - have conspired to hide the truth about @entity12 immigration from the @entity11 public			1
‘ they have taken down our borders and handed over control of who who enters the @entity11 to the @entity90 in @entity91			0
’ @entity92 will use his local election campaign launch , taking place today in the @entity95 , to make a direct attack on @entity1 -- warning voters that backing the upstart party will reduce their chances of having a say in a referendum			1
the @entity102 will unveil their own poster , showing a referendum ballot - box marked ‘ @entity36 : you decide ’ alongside the words : ‘ an in - @entity107 on @entity36			1
@entity81 and the @entity82 wo n’t			0
’ seeking to address scepticism over his pledge , mr @entity92 will say : ‘ to those people who say you wo n’t deliver that renegotiation or referendum , i say : judge me by my record as prime minister			0
‘ others talk about acting in the national interest or standing up to @entity36 , i do it , time and again - often in the teeth of opposition in @entity91 and with a backdrop of uncertainty about whether it can really happen at home			1
‘ people said i would never veto a @entity6 treaty			1
in 2011 that ’s exactly what i did			0
people said my attempts to cut the @entity6 budget would fail			1
but i secured that cut			0
‘ people said i could n’t get @entity11 out of the eurozone bailout scheme which @entity81 got us into , but i did just that			0
and now , we ’re not liable to pay for any @entity135 country that needs a bail - out			0
‘ so i have a track record of delivery - and i believe me , whatever it takes , i will deliver this in - out referendum			0
@entity92 's approach to the issue is a ' you decide ' campaign			2
@entity145 's party has attacked @entity1 's ' xenophobia ' and ' lies ' ‘ i would not be prime minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in - out referendum			0
because the @entity11 people deserve their say			0
and i will make sure they get it			0
’ @entity81 ’s former @entity156 leader said voters considering backing @entity1 needed to be ‘ educated ’ about its ‘ lies ’ and ‘ xenophobia ’			0
@entity160 said mr @entity13 was ‘ not the worst ’ person in @entity1 and had some ‘ nasty people trailing behind him ’			1
‘ we have n’t educated people as to what they are all about - @entity1 voters need to be educated , ’ he added .			0
