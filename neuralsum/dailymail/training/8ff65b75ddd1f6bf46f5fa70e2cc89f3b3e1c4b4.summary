by @entity0 for @entity1 a young girl suffering a rare condition , which causes her to vomit up to 30 times a day , has beaten the illness by taking up karate			1
@entity8 , six , was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome which can cause her to throw up uncontrollably for up to 14 hours a day when an attack hits			1
at her lowest ebb , she could n't take part in any activities without being constantly sick			0
she took days to recover after attacks and was so weak from vomiting she could barely stand and struggled to walk back from school			1
for years @entity8 , 6 , would have attacks causing her vomit for up to 14 hours due to rare condition @entity19 , until she found karate lessons helped ease the illness after taking up martial arts @entity8 's attacks halved in frequency and severity			1
her mother said this is due to @entity8 's body building up stamina but after @entity8 , from @entity31 in south @entity32 started taking karate lessons the number of attacks she suffers has almost halved			1
her mother @entity36 , 35 said she believes this is down to @entity8 's body building up stamina			1
@entity8 's condition is so rare that three different doctors were unable to diagnose her illness , but offered theories ranging from viral infections , allergies and bulimia			1
but after almost two years of being almost constantly sick , @entity8 was referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with cyclical vomiting syndrome ( @entity19 ) - a rare condition which causes suffers to vomit for long periods without interval			1
she was suffering an attack every couple of weeks - but after starting martial arts classes , the frequency and length of the attacks has been dramatically cut			1
mrs @entity8 , a support worker for adults with learning disabilities said seeing her daughter so ill made her feel helpless as a mother			1
she said : ' it 's horrendous seeing her when she 's really ill , i feel useless as a mum you just want to take the pain away and make her feel better			2
' she 's so exhausted during and after the episodes that she can barely stand			1
' we just carry her if she needs the toilet or to get to the doctors because her legs are like jelly and she 's so dizzy			2
' i started taking my son @entity72 to karate in 2012 to try and build up his confidence , but @entity8 was too young then and too ill. @entity36 , 35 , with husband @entity75 , 36 , son @entity72 , 8 said that karate has not only helped daughter @entity8 's condition , but is an integral part of her family 's life ' but she could see how much @entity72 was enjoying it and she was desperate to go , so at the end of last year , she started going and has n't looked back			1
' learning that @entity8 could take karate lessons - and that they helped with her condition - was a massive help , mrs @entity8 added			1
she said : ' @entity87 had struggled to find any other activity she could keep up with , she even struggled to walk home from school without getting sick			0
@entity19 symptoms are shared by many other conditions , and diagnosis is by ruling out every other cause			0
because of this it can be years before reaching a diagnosis , and any effective treatment			0
many @entity19 sufferers with short and relatively infrequent attacks are often told it ’s “ a stomach bug ” and receive little or no help for many years			0
in other sufferers psychological causes are often considered , when the cause is actually cvs this often delays treatment and adds stress to an already difficult situation			0
awareness of @entity19 in the medical profession has increased but @entity19 is still , all too often , overlooked as a potential diagnosis			0
there have been no large , well - controlled studies , to show which drugs work best but a number of treatments are available to both stop , or reduce the severity of an attack , or to prevent the attack from starting			2
recent research suggests that mitochondrial dna mutations may play a role in @entity19 and that it may be an inherited condition passed down the maternal line			0
' but it turned out karate was the perfect outlet , it was a massive turning point			0
now her body is strong she can recover quickly , which is amazing			0
' before karate it used to take her days to get better , but it 's really chopped the recovery period in half			2
' karate has not just helped my daughter , it 's become an integral part of our family life			2
' @entity8 first started showing symptoms of the rare condition - which typically develops during childhood - at the age of three when she would experience dizziness , stomach cramps , and excessive perspiration			1
from that point , she would have attacks of severe vomiting every few weeks , causing her family to become increasingly concerned for her health			0
at a loss as to how to treat her condition , baffled doctors put her on anti-sickness medicine to prevent the nausea			0
her body instantly rejected the tablets , regurgitating anything she attempted to swallow			2
it was n't until she was referred to a specialist at age four that @entity8 was diagnosed with the vomiting disorder			1
the diagnosis had come after years of confusion and difficulty managing @entity8 's condition , said mrs @entity8			1
she said : ' the doctors seemed clueless and so were we			0
' the episodes were put down to viral infections , bugs , something she ate , but we knew deep down that it was something worse			0
' no one else in the family was ill and after nearly a year she was finally sent to a specialist and was diagnosed with @entity19 , something i had never heard of before			0
' we manage her episodes with paracetamol for the pain and try to keep her hydrated with ice lollies			0
' @entity8 wanted to try karate because her brother @entity72 , 8 , enjoyed it so much but the diagnosis brought no relief			1
although doctors knew what was wrong with @entity8 they were unable to help her - and it was only when she joined her local karate club that her family noticed a difference in her symptoms			1
@entity8 has now passed three belts with distinctions and will be grading for her next belt in the @entity200 programme in september			2
dr @entity201 , chair of the @entity203 @entity202 , said : ' @entity19 affects approximately 2 per cent of the school age population but is probably as frequent in adults too - onset can be at any age			2
' it is a poorly understood condition in which the sufferers are usually healthy and normal between episodes but have debilitating attacks of relentless nausea and vomiting			2
' attacks last between 1 - 4 days for most people but can last as long as two weeks in extreme cases , with vomiting up to six times an hour			0
' attacks in some sufferers happen in a regular pattern , i.e. every couple of weeks or months			0
in others there is no clear pattern			0

@entity8 , 6 , was diagnosed with rare @entity203
condition causes her to throw up for 14 hours a day when suffering attack
@entity228 left her unable to swallow medication and too weak to stand or walk
after wanting to try karate like her brother @entity72 , 8 , it was foundto help
since taking up karate her attacks have halved in frequency and severity
mother @entity36 , 35 , believes @entity8 's body is building up stamina
