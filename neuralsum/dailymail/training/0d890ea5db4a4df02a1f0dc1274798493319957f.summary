@entity0 invoked @entity2 's warning that political parties could only be successful if they reflect modern society @entity0 launched an emphatic defence of gay marriage yesterday , saying the @entity7 will not win the next election unless they drop their opposition to it			1
he urged the party to emulate @entity13 president @entity12 by appealing to young voters and women with a socially liberal message			0
but the chancellor 's intervention provoked anger on the @entity20 , with campaigners claiming that proposals to legalise gay marriage could cost the conservatives more than a million votes and 30 seats			1
one mp said the ' social liberal values of @entity29 do n't translate well outside the @entity30 ' , while a former @entity20 minister warned that @entity33 chaplains could face the sack if they disagree with the plans			1
writing in @entity36 , mr @entity0 said most voters support gay marriage and politicians should ' reflect the modern societies they aspire to lead '			1
he quoted @entity2 saying the @entity7 should respond to ' people and how they want to live their lives '			2
the @entity43 has pledged to legalise gay marriage before 2015 , but it is not part the government 's current legislative programme			1
however , mr @entity0 used his article to argue that it is a vital plank of conservative re- election plans			0
he said the party should heed the lessons of mr @entity12 's election success despite poor economic conditions			2
in a robust shot across the bows of the @entity20 , mr @entity0 said voters on both sides of the @entity59 want economic toughness and social liberalism			2
he added that mr @entity12 sealed victory once he started making the case that the deficit should be tackled and showed that he ' was on the side of ordinary , hard - working voters '			0
but crucially , he said the @entity7 , like mr @entity12 's opponent @entity67 , could lose supporters who agree with them on the economy if they are not in tune with them on social issues as well			2
he wrote : ' president @entity12 's high - profile endorsement of equal marriage for gay couples enthused younger voters			2
but polls found that a majority of all @entity13 supported him on the issue and voted for it in all four states that held ballots			0
' @entity13 president @entity12 used an @entity85 interview in may this year to say he believed same - sex couples should be allowed to marry mr @entity0 continued : ' i would n't change the current abortion laws and i strongly support gay marriage on principle			1
i am proud to be part of a government that will introduce a @entity93 to allow gay marriage			1
' it is worth reflecting that in @entity101 , as in @entity13 , a clear majority of the public support gay marriage , and an even bigger majority of women support it			1
' that majority support is just as high in the @entity104 as it is the @entity105 , and it is equally high among all socio - economic groups			0
former defence minister sir @entity107 has warned the @entity108 that military chaplains could be sacked if they oppose gay marriage ' successful political parties reflect the modern societies they aspire to lead			1
as @entity2 said in the first sentence of her introduction to the 1979 @entity116 election manifesto : “ the heart of politics is not political theory , it is people and how they want to live their lives ”			1
' the @entity43 , which opposes gay marriage , dismissed mr @entity0 's claims and announced that it will campaign in tomorrow 's @entity124 by - election against a redefinition of the institution			1
@entity128 , the organisation 's campaign director , said : ' the @entity130 and the chancellor must stop misleading the public			2
the polls actually show that a majority of voters do not support the redefinition of marriage			0
' it 's time for senior politicians – particularly mr @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity0 – to get a grip and start talking about the issues that really matter , like reviving the economy , not redefining marriage			0
' he highlighted a poll by the research consultancy @entity147 that found that redefining marriage could cost the @entity7 up to 30 parliamentary seats and 1.1million votes			0
' ordinary people in places like @entity124 want action on the economy and public services , not meddling with marriage , ' he said			0
@entity20 backbencher @entity155 said : ' the focus should be less on these social liberal obsessions of @entity158 and more on blue - collar issues like the cost of living , mortgages and reducing taxes for families			0
' the social liberal values of @entity29 do n't translate well outside the @entity30			0
' former defence minister sir @entity107 has written to defence secretary @entity165 warning that military chaplains face being disciplined if the @entity168 forces through its plans			1
he wrote : ' under the government 's proposals if the definition of marriage is rewritten , then those chaplains who maintain their support for the traditional / biblical meaning could face disciplinary action and even dismissal			2
' the former minister also dismisses recent assurances from the government that it can protect churches from prosecution			0
he said : ' the government is keen to assert that no clergy declining to offer a marriage service to homosexuals will be subject to discrimination or penalty , an undertaking ministers are in no position to give since the interpretation of any new law will rest with the courts and , ultimately , the impertinent @entity196			0

chancellor says @entity67 's defeat in race for the @entity201 shows winning the economic argument is not enough
@entity20 election *strategist* invokes @entity2 's message that political parties only win when they reflect modern society
backbenchers will rebel against gay marriage legislation as former defence minister warns military chaplains could be sacked if they oppose the policy
