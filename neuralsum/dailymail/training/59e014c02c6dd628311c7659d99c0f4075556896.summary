by @entity0 sitting in the middle of a vast desert , an eerie abandoned cinema lies waiting for its first movie to be screened			2
it has been over a decade since the outdoor cinema was built in the southern tip of the @entity9 in @entity10 , at the bottom of a desert mountain range			1
the site is accessible by just one road - called @entity14 - and few people ever go there			0
now the 150 wooden seats are weathered and worn by the apocalyptic surroundings , and remain empty			1
the screen 's foundations stand broken and the building housing the generator and projector has been left crumbling			0
what a picture : the abandoned cinema is still waiting for its first movie to be screened view from space : the ' @entity28 ' cinema , located in the @entity9 , @entity10 according to @entity30 , the @entity31 photographer who took these shots , the @entity29 was built by a wealthy @entity33 who decided it would be the perfect location for a bizarre cinema			1
he went to @entity36 to buy everything he needed from an old theatre			0
however things did n't exactly go according to plan			0
on the night of the premiere the generator powering its grand debut cut out			1
apparently , the local authorities were n't very excited about the idea of having a theatre in the middle of the desert , and it is suspected that they might have had something to do with the premiere 's incidents			0
mr @entity30 said : ' @entity10 is and was kind of a police state			1
in @entity9 it 's actually forbidden to go to the desert if you do n't take a tour or organized trip			2
these tours and trips take you to all the same places and actually one route is just two miles away from the cinema			0
' i think most of the locals know about this place but because of the â € ˜ confusionâ € ™ between this @entity33 , local government and @entity71 , it 's a topic that 's not really talked about , ' he added			2
' at the premier evening everything went " accidentally " wrong , their electricity generator was sabotaged and no movies were ever screened at the @entity29			0
