@entity0 has reported a 13th consecutive quarterly fall in general sales - this time blaming a warm september			1
@entity4 's biggest clothing retailer by revenue said sales of clothing , footwear and homeware , fell four per cent in the 13 weeks to september 27			2
today 's results mean that @entity0 is falling further behind rivals , with @entity12 now more profitable and @entity14 's sales growth in recent years has soared at rate that @entity0 would envy			1
boss @entity16 has been in the firing line because he has struggled to turn around the @entity19 stalwart since he took over as chief executive from sir @entity21 in 2010			0
but the 130 - year - old group did post an increase in underlying first - half profit for the first time in four years			1
mr @entity16 said : @entity45 & @entity46 delivered sales growth and increased profit in the first half despite a tough market , particularly in september			1
we are pleased with the progress we have made against our key priorities for the year			2
' online sales on its new website , part of a £ 150million revamp , were down 4.6 per cent in the second quarter , but this was better than the 8.1 per cent fall in the previous quarter			1
food sales have slowed to a 0.2 per cent rise in the quarter compared to 1.7 per cent in the previous quarter			1
the retailer said up to 200 simply food stores are now planned over the next three years , compared with 150 previously guided			2
@entity0 said today it was pleased with results despite ongoing struggles @entity0 shares ended last week at 406.7p having lost 20 per cent of their value since hitting 511p in february			1
but they opened 30p higher because of the news this morning			0
a company spokesman said : ' womenswear performance continues to improve with growth in full price sales and increasingly positive feedback from our customers			0
' however , the recent market conditions remain challenging , with unseasonal weather resulting in high levels of promotional activity across the market			1
' despite some improvement in consumer confidence , market conditions continue to be challenging			0
as a result , we remain cautious about the outlook for the remainder of the year			0
however , we are confident that we are well set up for the key @entity91 trading period			0
' there have also been complaints by customers about a drop in quality but no drop in price and its production line has been branded sluggish , making it too slow to react to fashion trends			0
but mr @entity16 , who joined the company in 2010 , highlighted an improving trend in womenswear following ' increasingly positive feedback ' from customers , with sales up 1.3 per cent when excluding september			0
@entity0 also said that a recent survey found than 69 per cent of customers believed their ranges were on trend and fashionable			2
analysts noted the green shoots but said it was too soon to say whether @entity16 was finally delivering a turnaround			0
' beyond the flagship stores , many still feel like museums where older people go to browse black slacks , ' said @entity122 , director of the retail consultancy @entity123			0
' no amount of hand - wringing about september 's unseasonal weather can explain away such weak clothing sales across the six - month period			1
' but @entity16 may have done just enough to avoid the rocks - for now '			0
flop ? leading ladies show off the @entity0 collection , but clothing and general merchandise sales are down yet again rival @entity12 , which has consistently outperformed @entity0 in recent years , was last week forced to warn that profits for the year will be £ 25million lower than expected because of the warm autumn			1
next has overtaken @entity0 in terms of profits , raking in £ 695million last year to its more established rival 's £ 623million			1
but @entity14 shrugged off the warm winter weather blighting many of its rivals by managing to grow sales during the past four weeks			1
@entity139 , partner at @entity140 said : ' whilst the unusually warm @entity141 months has afflicted many clothing retailers , @entity0 ’s 1.6 per cent fall in sales demonstrates it has continued to lose market share			1
' with @entity91 just around the corner , analysts will be watching @entity0 ’s food sales extremely closely as success here will surely buy @entity16 more time for his strategy to bear fruit			1
but the biggest test will be whether the new clothing ranges can help @entity0 regain some of its recent market share losses			2
' @entity157 , managing director of retail consultancy @entity158 , said there were some glimmers of hope from the retailer , particularly on signs that its strategy of becoming more fashion - focused is starting to pay off			0
he added : ' overall , @entity0 's school report for this term reads ' showing signs of improvement ' , but there is quite some way to go before it is back at the top of the class			2
' the latest @entity0 clothing ranges have been well received by the fashion press but problems with the supply chain have held it back			1
shoppers have complained that stores run out of popular items while its website has suffered teething problems since its relaunch in february			0
@entity16 recently insisted that @entity0 is now ' fit for the future ' having spent more than £ 2.3billion on his turnaround strategy			1
but @entity187 , an analyst at @entity188 , said : ' we do n't expect much hard evidence to support a recovery thesis yet			0
' in fashion : @entity14 has been described by analysts as a ' retailing powerhouse ' that 's perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion @entity0 is being beaten by ' retailing powerhouse ' @entity14 , which has perfected the art of mixing low prices with high fashion			1
experts say it has won more customers every year by improving improving perceptions of its quality while keeping its prices low			0
it also concentrates on its stores , using its website to promote new items but does not have an online shopping feature			2
@entity208 , senior retail analyst at @entity209 , said @entity14 succeeds by being ' not just cheap but also by being very fashionable '			2
he said : ' the fact that the product may lack durability is neither here nor there - its shoppers are after something fast and disposable			0
' the @entity14 model relies on stores having mass destination appeal and shoppers not knowing what they are going to buy before they go in			2
' but they will never , ever leave empty - handed			0
and they will be back again very soon to do the same again			0
customers enjoying shopping , retail as a leisure pursuit - old guard , but highly effective nonetheless			0
' the high street giant has also considerably upped its fashion game in recent years , with stronger , on - trend ranges , which sees customers sharing pictures and videos of their shopping sprees at value retailers , analysts @entity230 said .			1

@entity0 general sales , mainly clothes , down 4 ***%*** for the latest quarter
but overall sales for the last six months *including* food rose **slightly** by 1 ***%***

but high street giant did reveal **slightly** higher half - year profits at £ 268m

next is now more profitable than @entity0 while @entity14 sales are soaring
