@entity0 held @entity1 to a gritty goalless draw at @entity3 as the visitors bounced back from last weekend 's embarrassing 8 - 0 defeat against @entity6			1
the point was enough to temporarily take @entity9 's side top ahead of the later fixtures - but it was an uninspiring @entity11 derby			1
@entity12 hit the bar for @entity1 while @entity0 's @entity14 escaped a clear handball in the area			1
@entity0 bounced back from last week 's heavy defeat at home to @entity19 to claim a point @entity1 ' @entity21 attempts to keep the ball away from @entity0 's @entity23 @entity24 took charge of his first match since taking over the reins at @entity28 's wolves : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity21 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 56 ) , @entity39 ( @entity12 56 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 79 )			1

booked : @entity23 , @entity59 , @entity48 referee : @entity66 attendance : 25,135 @entity56 and @entity58 wasted the committed visitors ' best chances in @entity24 's first game in charge			1
he made four changes from the side thumped 8 - 0 at home by @entity6 last week , 48 hours before his appointment			1
in came debutant @entity49 , on loan from @entity77 , @entity23 , @entity54 and @entity56			0
@entity39 started for @entity1 after he was recalled from his loan spell at @entity79 after @entity38 , who was on the bench , failed to recover fully from a groin injury			0
@entity82 was ruled out with a hamstring problem , with @entity40 replacing him up front			0
and the striker had @entity47 scrambling to turn his looping header over on six minutes			0
with plenty of the ball @entity1 were able to dictate the play but failed to seriously test a @entity0 side who shipped eight in their last game			2
@entity47 gathered @entity36 's 18 - yard effort but @entity24 would have been encouraged by his side 's solid , if unspectacular start			1
@entity35 ( right ) and @entity54 battle for the ball during the @entity100 match @entity0 teenager @entity101 ( centre ) dribbles with the ball while two @entity1 defenders close him down slowly though , the visitors did begin to create and @entity56 blazed into the side - netting after being left to pick up @entity53 's deep free - kick			1
and in the 26th minute @entity58 smashed wide after robbing @entity35 as @entity1 ' nerves grew			0
without the dynamism of @entity38 and @entity82 the one - dimensional hosts failed to penetrate the visitors and were reduced to long , hopeful , balls going forward			2
the pattern continued after the break with @entity1 stifled by hard - working @entity0 - although they survived a scare 10 minutes into the second half			1
@entity36 found space and crossed , only for the ball to hit @entity51 ' outstretched arm in the area - but @entity1 ' strong penalty claims were rejected			2
five minutes later @entity51 forced @entity30 into action , the goalkeeper parrying his header from @entity53 's corner			2
but @entity1 had been the better side since the restart and @entity35 flashed a low drive wide before @entity47 tipped @entity12 ' header over after he spilled substitute @entity38 's cross			0
@entity12 then chipped onto the bar on 71 minutes as @entity0 retreated and they were indebted to @entity47 a minute from time			2
@entity57 was left by @entity36 and his low cross was smartly kept out by the keeper , with @entity38 blazing the rebound over			0
@entity35 and @entity23 challenge for the ball as they look to win possession for their respective sides			0

@entity0 bounced back from last week 's embarrassing 8 - 0 defeat against @entity6
@entity24 took charge of his first match since *joining* @entity0
