@entity0 says he will not allow @entity2 's season to ' drift away ' after being appointed head coach until the end of the season			1
@entity0 was handed the reins at @entity7 until the end of the season on monday , starting with saturday 's @entity11 trip to @entity12			1
eleventh - placed @entity2 have lost their last three games and failed to win in four as the 50 - year - old former assistant manager seeks his first victory at the helm since succeeding @entity17 earlier this month			1
newly - appointed @entity2 boss @entity0 is determined to not let his side 's season ' drift away ' ' i 'm delighted to have got the job until the end of the season , ' @entity0 told nufc.co.uk			1
' everyone knows i love this club and my goals are simple - to finish as high as we can in the @entity11 and get as many points as we can			2
' everybody on the outside is talking about our season petering away but i am not going to allow that to happen			0
@entity0 will be hoping he can pick up his first win at the helm when his side travel to @entity12 on saturday ' those who are saying that do n't know me , do n't know the people around me and do n't know this group of players			1
' we 're much more professional than that			0
we ca n't afford to let the season drift away and i wo n't allow it to happen			2
' i 'm too demanding and i wo n't allow anyone to slacken off between now and the end of may			0
' @entity0 ( left ) and @entity44 ( right ) with @entity45 ( centre ) after he signed his professional contract @entity0 will work alongside @entity48 and @entity49 , the latter having stepped up from looking after the @entity52 ' under - 18 side , and says he plans to spend as much time on the training ground as he did when he was @entity17 's assistant			2
' i love being on the training pitch and the role of the head coach is to be hands - on out here , ' @entity0 said			2
' when you are a manager you have to manage the football club , but the role has changed and it gives me maximum time on the training ground , coaching the players			0
@entity17 ( right ) left the @entity67 club in december to become the new @entity69 manager ' what i have done is given @entity48 ( @entity71 ) and @entity49 ( @entity72 ) more responsibility because they are very good at what they do , and it is important that you delegate to those who are talented			0
' but when it comes to the meat of the session , it is my responsibility to prepare the team for the final 16 games			0
' the players have been really positive and have responded			0
' even though we have n't won a game yet , i think we 've played some nice stuff in spells			0
' ultimately though , it is about scoring goals and winning games so that needs to change			0
top scorer @entity95 could return for @entity2 after @entity96 went out of the @entity97 ' we 've done plenty of work on that on the training pitch and hopefully that little bit of luck we need will fall our way this weekend			2
' @entity0 's hopes of a first victory in charge could be boosted by the return of top scorer @entity95 following @entity96 's early exit from the @entity97 on tuesday			1
@entity96 's 2 - 0 defeat to @entity111 saw them crash out at the group stage and nine - goal @entity95 , who scored twice in a 2 - 2 home draw with @entity12 in september , could now be available for the trip to the @entity116			1
@entity12 boss @entity117 , who was linked with the @entity2 job , will want to stop @entity0 getting his first win			1
