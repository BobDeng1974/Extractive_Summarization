by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:16 pm on 25th november 2011 when @entity3 walked down the street , children hid behind their mothers because they were scared of what they saw			1
on becoming a father himself , he decided to have a face transplant , because he did n’t want his own son to be afraid of him			0
mr @entity3 , a former soldier whose face was destroyed saving a woman ’s life , can now smile again , feel the breeze on his face and warmth of his wife ’s kiss			1
mr @entity3 , 30 , of @entity29 , is one of the first people in the world to be given a whole new face			1
his face was destroyed when , as a young solider , he heroically saved the life of a woman 10 years ago			1
when the car he was in smashed into a 10,000 volt electrical pylon , he pushed the woman , who was also in the crash , out of harm ’s way , and thousands of volts of electricity surged through his body , severely burning his face			2
he then went through at least 20 corrective operations , with skin taken from his thighs and elsewhere in his body used to patch him up , but the results were far from satisfactory			1
the disfigurement scared children and fascinated adults , who stared at him when he ventured outside			0
he had no normal sensation in his face and had lost the bulk of his lips and so his girlfriend @entity22 had never kissed him on the lips			2
the 30 - year - old , pictured left as a soldier before the accident which destroyed his face , was left with horrific injuries and needing skin grafts following a car crash in which he saved a woman 's life			1
when he and @entity22 had a son , he decided it was finally time to get a new face			0
he said : ‘ i ’ve had kids hide and run behind their moms because they were so scared when they saw me			0
‘ that was hard to cope with because my friends started having kids , then my brother had a kid			0
‘ then i had @entity21 and i did n’t want kids to be afraid of me any more			0
’ on sunday , @entity76 documentary @entity75 will tell the story of the 14 hour operation , in which he was given an entire new face , including eyelids , lips , muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them and provide sensation			1
painstaking micro-vascular surgery was needed to attach the two main arteries to the new face , allowing mr @entity3 ’s heart to start supplying it with blood			1
getting ready : dr @entity92 , right , chats through the marathon procedure with mr @entity3 , left , before he goes under anaesthetic at the @entity96 hospital transformation : @entity3 , pictured during the documentary which followed his operation , said he can now feel the breeze on his face and his girlfriend 's kiss			1
overjoyed : mr @entity3 , pictured with his son @entity21 , said he hoped the procedure would transform his life five months after the @entity109 military - funded operation at @entity110 in @entity96 and mr @entity3 is starting to see some of his old features starting to come through as the swelling subsides			1
his speech is rapidly improving and he is able to do simple things like smile , purse his lips and scrunch his eyes			2
he can feel his son touch his face and can also do something he could n’t do even before the accident - grow a beard			2
he said : ‘ this face is really starting to feel more and more like mine every day and the sensation that i ’ve gained back is just extraordinary			0
‘ i can feel the breeze on my face now			2
it ’s just amazing how much sensation i ’ve gained back in such a short time			0
’ @entity131 : the team of more than 30 physicians , nurses , anaesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace mr @entity3 's face permanent reminder : @entity3 still has scars on his head following the micro-vascular surgery to rebuild his appearance @entity143 , who hopes to carry out @entity145 ’s first face transplant at @entity147 ’s @entity146 , believes the technique could one day benefit millions around the world			1
he said : ‘ there are a quarter of a million people in the @entity145 with severe facial disfigurement for whom reconstructive surgery has not worked			0
‘ they get stared at and they do n’t blend into a crowd			0
that ’s what most of them want , just to be normal			0
