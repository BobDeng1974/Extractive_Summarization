@entity1 is behaving like a ' mid 20th - century tyrant ' with the illegal annexation of @entity4 , foreign secretary @entity0 has warned			1
he said the @entity6 president will pay a ' political and economic price ' for what he is doing in the region but ruled out @entity10 offering arms to @entity12			1
the comments echo prince @entity15 ’s warning last year that ‘ @entity1 is doing just about the same as @entity17 ’			0
the aim is to draw up a possible joint document on implementing the much - violated september peace plan for eastern @entity12 concluded in @entity31 , @entity32			1
that agreement also featured a demilitarised zone , though the battle lines have since changed , and the government in @entity37 has offered a measure of autonomy to the separatists			0
speaking on @entity41 , mr @entity0 insisted there had to be a political solution to the crisis in eastern @entity12 and stressed that the proposed deal was ' one of the last opportunities @entity6 will have ' to avoid further damage to its economy			1
he dismissed mr @entity51 's remark that this is the last chance for peace as ' apocalyptic language ' , arguing there was already a combat situation on the ground			2
but mr @entity0 added : ' this is one of the last opportunities that @entity6 will have to avoid yet further significant damage to its economy which is bound to happen if the intransigence of @entity1 forces the rest of the world to increase and tighten the sanctions from which @entity6 's economy is already reeling			1
' @entity23 has ruled out providing lethal aid to the @entity12 forces in contrast to the @entity67 which is considering supplying arms in certain circumstances			1
@entity23 chancellor @entity70 and @entity24 president @entity51 travelled to @entity71 last week to hold talks with mr @entity1 @entity74 mp @entity73 , chairman of the defence select committee , warned against defence cuts cutting @entity10 defence spending could encourage further aggression by @entity6 , a senior @entity74 mp warned			1
@entity73 , who chairs the @entity79 , said the @entity81 commitment to devoting at least 2 per cent of national wealth to the military was ' really key ' to showing @entity1 the alliance was serious over @entity12			2
' we need a manifesto commitment that lays out a long - term obligation , ' he told @entity89 's @entity88 : ' the 2 per cent is really key			0
' if we look at @entity6 and @entity12 at the moment , @entity1 is testing us			1
he is testing our resolve ; he wants to work out whether @entity81 is serious			0
' one of the biggest indicators on that is we committed , at the @entity96 summit , to spend 2 per cent of gdp on defence			2
we have encouraged lots of other countries to do the same thing			0
' chancellor @entity102 insisted @entity10 remained ' hugely influential in the world '			2
but he refused to confirm the 2 per cent target would continue to be met after the election			0
' we are currently hitting that target			0
i am not going to pre-judge our defence review			2
but people know that we care about our nation 's security and defence because we have invested in the latest equipment			2
' people know we have met the 2 per cent commitment and are meeting it today			0
' mr @entity0 said @entity10 's position was currently not to provide arms to @entity12 , adding : ' this is a national decision for each country to make			1
' there is no military solution to this conflict			0
the @entity12 ca n't beat the @entity6 army			1
that is not a practical proposition			0
there has to be a political solution and the @entity128 , mr @entity1 , has to understand he will pay a political and economic price for what he is doing in the @entity12			1
' @entity10 's position is that at the moment we do n't think supplying arms is the right thing to do but obviously if the situation on the ground changes we will keep that position under review			1
' he refused to be drawn on the circumstances under which the @entity10 might consider supplying arms saying he would not talk about a hypothetical situation			1
mr @entity0 also said he believes the sanctions currently in place against @entity6 - combined with the falling oil price - are having the desired effect despite mr @entity1 's public reassurances that all is well			1
he said : ' @entity1 is toughing this out in his public presentation			0
you would expect him to do that			0
it 's the kind of person he is			0
' but we all know and @entity6 certainly know , thinking back to the days of the @entity157 , that in the end the economic facts can not be ignored			1
if your economy is cratering you can not support the kind of foreign adventures @entity1 is undertaking , you can not support the kind of security state structure that he has generated and that he needs to keep him there			0
' so he will have to trim his behaviour to reflect the decline in the @entity6 economy and sanctions are a critical part of the pressure on him to change his behaviour			2
' the current negotiations are not about the annexation of @entity4 , which mr @entity0 denounced as illegal , but he insisted @entity6 's withdrawal from it would be the next demand if the plan for eastern @entity12 is accepted by mr @entity1			1
he added : ' do n't make it sound like that is an outrageous thing for us to demand			0
' this man has sent troops across an international border and occupied another country 's territory in the 21st century acting like some mid- 20th century tyrant			0
' we do not behave like that			0
civilised nations do not behave like that in the 21st century			0
we live in a rules - based society			2
we want the @entity6 people to be part of that international community			2
' we want @entity6 to enjoy the kind of economic growth and rising standards of living that people in the rest of @entity202 enjoy and we do not see any reason to tolerate this kind of outrageous and outdated behaviour from the @entity128			1
' mr @entity0 ruled out @entity10 arming the @entity12 forces under threat from @entity6 aggression @entity209 insists @entity10 is playing an ' active role ' in @entity202 's response to @entity6 aggression in @entity12 , despite the fact that mrs @entity70 and mr @entity51 were spearheading the diplomatic effort to end the conflict			1
mr @entity0 ruled out @entity10 arming the @entity12 forces under threat from @entity6 aggression general sir @entity216 , @entity10 's former top @entity81 commander , said the @entity10 should be playing a major role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all - out @entity202 war			1
' the @entity10 is a major @entity81 member , it is a major @entity225 member , it is a member of the @entity227 , and it is unfortunate that the weight that the @entity10 prime minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent , ' he said			2
yesterday the president of @entity232 , @entity233 , said the appeasement of @entity17 in 1938 , which failed to avert war , should be a ‘ lesson to all of us ’			2
he added : ‘ we know from history that appeasement will never satisfy those that are being appeased			0
’ @entity67 senator @entity242 reportedly invoked the ghost of @entity244 in 1938 , saying : ‘ history shows us that dictators will always take more if you let them			0
they will not be dissuaded from their brutal behaviour when you fly to meet them			0
’ @entity74 mp @entity73 , chairman of the defence select committee , warned @entity102 against cutting defence spending below the @entity81 target of 2 per cent of @entity252 , claiming this would encourage further aggression by @entity71 .			1

@entity6 president will pay a ' political and economic price ' , says @entity0
but he rules out @entity10 offering arms to @entity12 to face down @entity71
@entity23 and @entity24 are leading peace talks with @entity6 president
@entity74 mp warns @entity10 defence cuts could encourage @entity6 *agression*
