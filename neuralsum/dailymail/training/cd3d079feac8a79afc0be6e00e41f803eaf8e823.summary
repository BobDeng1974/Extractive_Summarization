by @entity0 cannabis plants have been growing for months next to iconic @entity3 landmarks			0
a group known as @entity5 has planted seeds around @entity7 , @entity8 and along the @entity9 in a guerrilla protest against ' ludicrous ' drug laws			1
the move , they claim , demonstrates that marijuana naturally flourishes in @entity15 and should , therefore , be legal			1
protest : @entity17 campaign group has planted marijuana plants across @entity3 ( pictured by @entity19 and @entity20 ) in a bid to highlight that it naturally flourishes in @entity15 and , therefore , should be legal it is also a bid to raise awareness about medicinal uses of the drug - while growing crops for users so they do not have to rely on black market dealers			1
releasing images of the illegal plants next to @entity19 , the @entity33 and a busy @entity3 high street , the campaigners have urged the government to follow @entity36 and a number of @entity39 states in legalising the @entity41 drug			1
@entity42 , a farmer and representative of the group , explained their actions			0
' we have two primary objectives , ' said @entity42 , who is in his 20s			0
' we want to raise awareness for medicinal users who need cannabis to improve their quality of life			0
trend : the protest follows similar moves in @entity56 as campaigners urge the government to follow the lead of @entity36 and some @entity39 states , which have recently legalised the @entity41 drug landmarks : this small cannabis plant is pictured growing on @entity3 's @entity9 , while others have cropped up near the @entity33			1
the group claims they will give the crops to medicinal users to cut out black market dealers ' we also want to supply medicinal and recreational users with seeds so they are no longer dependent on the black market dealers			2
' the stunt echoes a protest in the town of @entity74 , @entity56 , where thousands of cannabis plants sprouted up last year due a similar protest movement			2
@entity42 said : ' @entity77 is a catastrophic failure , and i think that cannabis growing openly on the streets of @entity3 emphasises how ludicrous our drugs laws are			0
' putting a human in a prison cell for using a plant is the crime			0
