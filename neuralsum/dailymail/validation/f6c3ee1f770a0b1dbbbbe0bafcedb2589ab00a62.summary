a detailed search for @entity2 rubbish on the south west coast of @entity4 might have indicated that the hunt for missing flight @entity6 is in the wrong place			1
volunteers have scoured beaches , rocks and shallow waters along a 60 - mile stretch of coast in the lower corner of the island state , located to the south of the @entity19 continent , picking up no less than 80,000 pieces of rubbish			1
some of the debris has drifted 6,000 miles across the @entity2 from as far away as @entity23 and @entity24 but there has been nothing that appears to be from the @entity28 jet			2
yet the official search area for the aircraft , some 1200 miles south west of @entity29 in @entity30 , lies virtually in the path that the rubbish from the other side of the ocean has drifted along			1
doomed : a detailed search for @entity2 rubbish on the south west coast of @entity4 might have indicated that the hunt for missing @entity6 ( pictured ) is in the wrong place if nothing more , the discovery of rubbish from @entity23 and @entity24 confirms that the ocean tides will carry debris many thousands of miles , passing close to the @entity6 search area , to the shores of @entity30 - and perhaps onwards into the @entity46			1
there have been numerous suggestions that despite complex mathematical calculations the search for the aircraft , which vanished more than a year ago on its way from @entity52 to @entity53 with 239 passengers and crew , is in the wrong area			1
and while the rubbish clean - up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of @entity4 was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft , the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west			1
if there was anything in southern @entity4 from the jet , the team would have found it , for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice			1
the @entity79 reported today that 27 people spent eight nights at sea in a fleet of fishing boats , travelling from @entity85 to the mouth of @entity87 in an annual effort to clean the beaches of rubbish floating in from the vast ocean			0
tragic : tourists sign a wall of condolence for the victims of @entity6 at @entity97 's @entity52 airport in late january , @entity97 's government formally declared the plane 's disappearance an accident and said all those on board were presumed dead			2
pictured is a screen at the departure hall of @entity52 airport no - one reported finding anything that suggested discovered debris was from the jet - but they uncover a great deal of other items that could be traced back to boats and even to @entity23 and the @entity117 continent			2
‘ we found a roll of tape from @entity23 that ’s from a vanilla bean manufacturer , ’ said expedition leader @entity118			0
‘ we found a bit of stuff from @entity24 washing around			0
we found a drift card from @entity126 ( @entity24 ) that ’s like a fish tag - oh , and a set of dolls ’ plastic shoes			0
’ mr @entity118 said the volunteers had been visiting the beaches for a number of years ‘ and we ’re slowly willowing out that big stuff and now all that ’s left is the big stuff what washed up between our visits and the small stuff below the sand			2
’ most of the rubbish has come from commercial fishing boats such as ropes , floats and pieces of net , but mr @entity118 told the @entity79 that more and more plastic items like drink bottles had been washed up			0
but so far , nothing from @entity6			0
it is one year since @entity6 went missing			0
here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months			0

volunteers have been cleaning a 60 - mile stretch of the @entity4 coast
they *gathered* 80,000 pieces of rubbish - some as small as a grain of rice
but so far there has been no sign of any debris from doomed flight @entity6
volunteers say this is *impossible* if jet *crashed* in the current search area
suggests *investigators* could be looking for the aircraft in the wrong place
