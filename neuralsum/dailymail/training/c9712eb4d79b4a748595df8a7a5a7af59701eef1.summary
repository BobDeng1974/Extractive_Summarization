by @entity0 and @entity1 a senior minister last night risked causing fury in @entity4 by mocking the ‘ @entity6 mess ’ at the heart of @entity8			2
as it emerged that @entity11 has rebuked @entity12 for highlighting the ‘ preposterous ’ number of @entity14 at the top of government , @entity9 appeared on television with a spoof newspaper front page fuelling the row			1
the communities minister - who attends @entity21 but is not given the full cabinet minister status - echoed the @entity23 ’s view that there needed to be more state school pupils like her at the heart of government			2
it featured a picture of @entity11 and the faces of other old @entity6 in number ten - chief of staff @entity44 , bumbling cabinet office minister @entity46 and policy chief @entity47 - in a pudding bowl			1
holding up the front page on @entity33 ’s @entity30 , @entity9 said : ' mine is this one , which is the story that we had earlier this week about @entity12 talking about people at the top of the @entity21			1
' @entity55 takes @entity34 off the menu , and replaces it with bread and butter pudding			1
' @entity9 , the former @entity59 chairman , went on : ‘ @entity12 [ @entity60 ] was making an incredibly serious point that it ca n’t be right that the seven per cent of kids who go to independent school end up at the top tables , not just of politics , but banking and law and every other profession			1
’ in an extraordinary swipe at the prime minister and his advisers , @entity9 mocked them up in a pudding bowl she added that the @entity23 ‘ wants to create a first class , a world class state system which means that in future years you will have more pupils from state schools , people like me , around the @entity21 table and in that i fully support @entity12			1
’ mr @entity12 said in a newspaper interview at the weekend that the number of old @entity6 in mr @entity11 ’s inner circle is ‘ preposterous ’			1
he told the ft : ‘ it does n’t make me feel personally uncomfortable because i like each of the individuals concerned , but it ’s ridiculous			2
‘ i do n’t know where you can find some such similar situation in a developed economy , ’ the @entity23 has told colleagues his remarks were not meant to embarrass the prime minister			0
they were interpreted as a jibe at @entity97 mayor @entity96 , another old @entity98 , since mr @entity12 is said to have decided to support chancellor @entity99 as mr @entity11 ’s successor			1
last night it emerged that mr @entity12 - who won a scholarship to private @entity103 - was admonished by the prime minister over the weekend for his attack on the influence of @entity6			1
a @entity21 source told the @entity108 : ‘ he was b * * * * * * d ’			0
the education secretary is understood to have accepted that he had blundered			0
the @entity112 magazine quoted another source saying mr @entity12 had been ‘ torn a new one ’			2
communities secretary @entity114 today insisted he was not interested in where people went to school			0
the 61 - year - old , who attended @entity119 in @entity120 , told @entity122 radio : ' i 'm anything but posh , but frankly i do n't think you should judge somebody on where they came from and whether they went to @entity6 or @entity130			0
' i 'm not even slightly worried about people inside the government who went to @entity6			0
there are two people with ministerial responsibilities that went to @entity138 grammar school in @entity139 in my department and i 'm not worried about that			0
' we should n't be worried so much about where people come from as where they are going			0
the school was attended by the prime minister and costs £ 33,000 a year earlier a cabinet said that @entity9 ’s mock front page would be seen as ‘ a weak joke ’			2
the peer was said to have been furious when she was demoted as party chairman in the 2012 @entity21 reshuffle by the prime minister			0
she reportedly insisted she would not remain in the government unless her job at the @entity160 was augmented with another one as a @entity162 minister			0
@entity9 also clashed with @entity163 over gay marriage			1
she said last night she had abstained in a vote on the issue as she felt religious communities ‘ needed to have the protection ’ but had been on a ‘ personal journey ’ since			0
‘ you will find over time religious communities and individuals will change too … let ’s allow that process to happen more naturally , rather than shoving it down people ’s throats , because i think what we will end up finding is that over time people - like the @entity59 , like @entity11 , like many of us in the @entity59 - will start to change their position , ’ she added			2
