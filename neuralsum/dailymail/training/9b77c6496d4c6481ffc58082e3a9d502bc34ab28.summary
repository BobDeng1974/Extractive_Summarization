by @entity0 published : 14:14 est , 1 november 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 1 november 2013 two engineering bosses have drunk fracking fluid in an attempt to show the world it is safe to use in the ground			1
@entity7 , vice-president of @entity9 , and @entity10 , chief executive of @entity11 , drank samples from champagne bottles			1
they urged onlookers to sip the mixture – which is injected into the ground during the fracking process – and 20 other executives did so			2
fracking fluid : @entity7 , vice-president of @entity21 , sipped the drink during a pr stunt to prove it is safe ironically @entity9 says the liquid is not safe for human consumption , but mr @entity7 said that what he drank was modified slightly with food additives			1
mr @entity10 told the @entity30 conference in @entity31 that the fluid was ‘ very stale - tasting ’			1
but he hoped his drinking it would make people reconsider their views on its safety			0
the stunt recalls that in 1990 when @entity39 , then minister of agriculture , tried to persuade his four - year - old daughter to eat a beef burger to play down the dangers of @entity43 – ‘ mad cow disease ’			2
thirty - two people later died of @entity47 , the human form of @entity43			0
campaigners say chemicals mixed with water and sand in the fracking process to force gas out of deep rock could contaminate soil and water supplies			2
' we were trying to show that whenever the oil and gas industry is shown a challenge , we view it as an opportunity to find solutions , ' @entity7 told the @entity63 , adding that they replaced ' very few ' chemicals with food additives			1
@entity9 invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or ' fracking ' , that allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations			1
it is now the biggest provider of services in @entity76 ’s fracking industry			1
but it has been fighting allegations that the fluids it injects into the ground as part of the hydraulic fracturing process are toxic , harmful to the environment and can contaminate human water supply			0
so the gas provider developed the @entity88 liquid using ingredients ' sourced from the food industry			1
' although @entity9 does say the fluid is not for human consumption			1
controversial : fracking allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations causing tiny fractures which allow long - term release of gas			2
but some say the fluids are toxic ' the purpose of drinking frack fluid is to say how one can in a dramatic way show people that their accepted wisdom on frack fluid disclosure is simply wrong , ' mr. @entity10 said			2
' it is especially wrong today as more and more companies have joined in to disclose contents of the fluids			0
' ' it was absolutely the first time i drank fracking fluid - you can be sure of that , ' said @entity10 , president of @entity30 and ceo of @entity11 ' i feel fine			1
' there was quite a build - up , but it was a bit of a let - down as it was less viscous than i thought it would be , but more viscous than water			0
and very stale - tasting			0
' it comes a month after @entity124 governor @entity123 told a @entity126 committee that he drank a glass of @entity9 's fracking fluid			1
' you can drink it			0
we did drink it around the table , almost rituallike , in a funny way , ' @entity123 told the @entity135			0
' it was a demonstration			0
… they ’ve invested millions of dollars in what is a benign fluid in every sense			0
' @entity76 's biggest : @entity9 invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or ' fracking ' , and is now @entity76 's biggest provider invented in 1949 , hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas - bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale , causing tiny fractures which allow long - term release of gas			1
in the @entity76 large - scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet , sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990			1
however , survey by the @entity161 showed the public ’s growing anxiety over fracking			0
almost half ( 49 per cent ) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in march — while 44 per cent were in favour			0
the skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes			2
' the oil and gas and oilfield services companies together have not done a good job in the past ten years in defending or proposing solutions , ' mr. @entity7 admitted			2
' but now obviously it is in our best interest to say , " look , here are some of the answers to the questions you had "			0
and we think we have done a good job and with data and with facts — not with rhetoric and rumour			0

@entity9 @entity198 *vp* @entity7 drank the fluid at an event in @entity31
he performed stunt at the meeting of the @entity204
he even had champagne bottles *filled* with the ' @entity88 ' liquid for all to try
@entity9 invented fracking and is now @entity76 's biggest provider
the firm 's fracking liquid ' @entity88 ' has ingredients from ' food industry '
