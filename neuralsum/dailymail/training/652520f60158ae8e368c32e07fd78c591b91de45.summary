by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 has challenged summer signing @entity4 to take over @entity6 's mantle as a match - winner			1
the 24 - year - old @entity9 international was a target for the @entity11 in the immediate aftermath of @entity6 's £ 19million departure for @entity14 in january , but they could not strike a deal with his club @entity17 at the time			1
however , their patience was rewarded last month when they finally got their man in a £ 7m swoop , and the newcomer showed flashes of his talent in last sunday 's 2 - 0 home defeat to champions @entity26			2
new boy : @entity4 was signed by @entity3 from @entity9 side @entity17 for £ 7million this summer replacement : @entity2 believes @entity30 can fill the void left by @entity6 's departure in january @entity4 is by no means a direct replacement for midfield schemer @entity6 , but he possesses similar star quality , and @entity2 is hoping he and fellow newcomers @entity35 and @entity37 can provide the flair and potency the club so clearly lacked during the second half of last season			1
the 53 - year - old said : ' they are different players			1
what @entity4 does in terms of great moments in the game , he can create them - obviously @entity6 could do that , so there 's a similarity in that			1
' you need a framework for those players and a platform to win games			0
now we need the other side of it , that special quality that @entity6 gave us , that @entity62 gave , @entity4 gave us			1
' @entity4 is very much a replacement for one of those three names , and @entity66 and @entity37 and @entity67 ( @entity68 ) and @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , who came on and produced a nice cameo , have got to ring the same bell a those other players			2
' @entity4 and his team - mates - @entity66 could be handed a @entity78 debut for the club this weekend after shaking off a foot injury - will attempt to open their account for the season at @entity84 on saturday following a creditable display in defeat to @entity26			1
gone : @entity6 moved to @entity14 for £ 19million in january , leaving @entity3 short poise : @entity4 showed some nice touches during his debut for @entity3 against @entity26 @entity3 might have snatched a point had in not been for a stunning last - gasp intervention by @entity92 to deny substitute @entity72 a late equalizer and @entity95 's injury - time strike , and @entity2 and his players have taken the positives from that performance			1
the manager said : ' we are in good shape			0
the feeling in the local media and press and among our fans is one of optimism			0
' that 's felt on the training ground as well			0
it 's felt by my staff - and some of my staff have been here for 25 years			0
' there 's a genuine feeling we have got a decent side here , and i think we need a couple of results under our belt and then we will see how quickly it grows			0
creative : @entity4 is expected to help @entity3 attack more this season and score a greater number of goals ' there are a lot of new players , though			1
someone said to me , are we carrying a bit of negative history for last season , but only half the team were playing			0
the other 50 per cent are new			0
' four of the men who started last weekend 's game - @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity4 and @entity37 - were making debuts , and @entity66 's inclusion this weekend would further enhance that new look			2
while that creates its own challenges , @entity2 admits significant change was required and has been delighted with the way owner @entity149 and managing director @entity151 have responded to his pleas			2
he said : ' that really helps lift the players who were here last year			0
that 's massive , i think , when you have had a disappointing season and the disappointment on the back of @entity6 's departure			2
' one of the points i have made to @entity149 and @entity151 , it 's important for new players to come in quickly			0
we did that and i 'm pleased with that			0
' spark : manager @entity2 believes @entity30 ( right ) is the sort of player @entity3 have been missing			1

@entity2 has challenged @entity4 to step up to the plate and replace @entity6
the 24 - year - old was a target for @entity3 when @entity6 left in january
they finally signed him for £ 7million in july from @entity9 side @entity17
he is not a direct replacement for @entity6 , but offers an attacking threat
@entity3 travel to @entity185 to take on @entity84 on saturday
