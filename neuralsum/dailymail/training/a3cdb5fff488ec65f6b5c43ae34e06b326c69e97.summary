he even once tried - and failed - to ban large containers of soda within @entity4 's five boroughs			2
but @entity15 's now gone a step further - not only does hizzonor not want you to smoke cigarettes , he does n't want you smoke fake cigarettes , either			1

@entity27 ' em if you got ' em : @entity4 is attempting to snuff out electronic cigarettes , like those made famous by actor @entity31 in the blue e-cig ad campaign the bills are written to include stricter regulations on all tobacco products by doing things like raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21			1
the plan also would prohibit the display of cigarette advertising in stores and create a $ 10.50 price floor for cigarette packs			0
it also would prohibit the use of tobacco coupons and increase fines against those selling illegal cigarettes			0
so e-cigs - which contain absolutely no tobacco - would n't be included , right ? wrong - according to the @entity54 , the bills would also classify e-cigs as ' tobacco products ' so they would be included with regular tobacco for the sake of the stricter regulations			1
it 's yet to be determined whether e-cigs are safer than cigarettes			2
they do n't contain tar or tobacco , but they are n't simply water vapor and nicotine , as e-cig manufacturers would want you to believe			1
