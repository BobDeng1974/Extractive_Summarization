forget @entity0 and @entity1 – there ’s only one retirement of note this year			1
@entity5 , the world ’s most prolific streaker , has stripped for the last time – and your intrepid reporter was there for his finale , wearing just a pair of @entity12			1
for two decades , the @entity14 father - of - three has been the @entity15 of the naked dash			1
in 1995 , he leapt naked on to @entity18 ’s weather map on daytime tv show @entity19 , and a year later he appeared nude on the green during the @entity21 at @entity22			1
then , in 2004 , he was fined £ 550 for trespassing after streaking across the pitch at the @entity25 in @entity26 – a match watched by 130 million people in 87 countries			1
flashback : @entity5 is hanging up his birthday suit after stripping off 519 times , including at the @entity21 at @entity33 when he was escorted from the green by police officers winning streak : the 48 - year - old once ran out onto @entity38 during the men 's final of the @entity41 no balls please : the streaker , who was lead away from @entity38 with a blanket covering his private parts , has given up streaking for good measure , @entity5 has also stripped off at @entity47 , @entity41 and @entity48			1
‘ there ’s no major venue or event i have n’t done , ’ he says proudly			2
‘ but i ’m nearly 49 now and my children have begged me to stop			2
i ’m not ready for my slippers just yet , but gravity ’s against me			2
’ last week , for his last outing – his 519th and final streak – i joined him			1
i would love to say that sitting naked on a bench in an icy @entity61 park was somehow a freeing experience			2
but , with my modesty barely covered by an @entity65 notepad , i would be lying			2
@entity66 with cold , i felt utterly ridiculous , a feeling not helped by the barks of derision from passers - by			1
@entity5 , of course – pro that he is – took the whole episode in his stride			1
but i was further discomforted to notice that even he , unlike me , was wearing clothes , after a fashion : a monkey g - string			1
‘ is n’t that cheating ? ’ i asked			2
he laughed : ‘ i ’ve shown my todger enough now , i think i ’ve earned my stripes			1
anyway , it ’s the buttocks that make people laugh			2
’ and that ’s the key to @entity5 ’s 20 - year ‘ career ’			1
middle - aged with a proud pot belly , he cuts a comical figure , wholly devoid of vanity			1
the title of his planned autobiography says it all : i did n’t know an inch would @entity96			1
@entity98 clever : mr @entity5 protected his modesty with a swimming cap and tutu when he jumped into the pool during @entity103 in @entity104 in 2003 ‘ i ’m no @entity105 or porn star , ’ he says			1
‘ that ’s why it ’s funny			2
i ’m just a regular , 16st fella			2
if i was buff , i ’d just be a poser			2
’ his odd obsession began by accident in 1993 when he saw a woman streak down the pitch at a @entity117 game in @entity118			1
‘ i was working in a bar over there and i was a bit merry , ’ he says			2
‘ when i saw that girl i said out loud , “ @entity124 , anyone could do that			2
’ ’ some bloke replied , “ ok , big mouth , you try it , ’ ’ and i said , “ all right then			2
” ‘ it was just ale talk			0
but the next day there was a bang at the door and it was a mate with a taxi waiting			0
i could n’t back out then			0
‘ everyone was dancing and clapping at the stadium and i started getting a buzz off the crowd – my heart was thumping through my chest			0
so i pushed to the front and took my shoes and socks off			0
‘ i ran backwards to wave to the crowd and , as i turned round , there was the ball			0
i picked it up and ran the whole length of the field and scored a try			0
there and then , i was hooked			0
’ therein lies the nub of @entity5 ’s compulsion : he loves to make people laugh			1
he says : ‘ my first time changed my life			0
everyone should try it once			0
i ’d never had any history of nudity			0
i ’m actually quite shy			0
on a beach , i ’m coy and i ’ll get changed under a towel			0
but when i perform , i ’m like a different man			0
cold front : in 1995 the @entity14 father of three leapt naked on to @entity18 ¿ s weather map on daytime tv show this morning ‘ what i realised that day in 1993 was that while i could perhaps make four or five people laugh by telling a joke in a pub , i could , just by doing something daft on a pitch , make tens of thousands of people laugh			1
‘ i do n’t have a compulsion to take my clothes off			0
it ’s only the laughter that matters			0
it ’s nothing like flashing			0
there ’s nothing sexual about it – it ’s just comedy nudity			0
’ not everyone gets the joke			0
his scuffles with over-zealous security guards over the years have left him with two broken toes , four broken ribs , a broken finger and 25 stitches in his leg			0
in 2007 , @entity192 sought an anti-social behaviour order banning @entity5 from displaying his buttocks and genitals in public			1
but the judge rejected the application , saying @entity5 ’s behaviour did not cause real distress			1
that viewpoint is what marks him apart from @entity203 , the so - called @entity203 , who has spent six years in jail after walking the length of @entity206 in the nude			1
on one occasion , for example , @entity203 was jailed for a breach of the peace after a judge said he had ‘ intentionally caused shock and alarm to children and their parents ’ after he deliberately [ walked ] naked past a busy children ’s play - park ’ – despite ‘ repeated police requests not to do so ’			1
not so super : mr @entity220 was carried off the field by @entity222 after he delayed the start of the second half of @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity26 in 2004 ‘ he thinks it ’s his right to walk naked wherever he wants and that has clearly caused offence , ’ says @entity5			1
‘ i just set out to entertain people and always in a big arena			0
i ’m no threat to anybody			0
’ but @entity5 has been kept in a cell overnight 30 times and fined a total of £ 4,000			1
single for nine years , @entity5 has three children – @entity1 , 24 , @entity5 , 19 , and @entity239 , 15 – by two different women but he no longer speaks to either of the mothers			1
it was a recent remark by son @entity5 that made him decide it was time to call it a day			1
@entity245 says : ‘ he said to me the other day , ‘ ‘ @entity246 , when are you going to stop , all my mates are watching you ? ’ ’ i asked him , “ what do they say ? ’ ’ ‘ and he said , “ they all laugh their heads off			0
’ so i replied , ‘ ‘ what ’s the problem , then ? ’ ’ he just said , “ well , you ’re my dad			0
’ ’ that really hit home with me			0
’ @entity5 left school at 15 , with no qualifications			1
now jobless , he lives in a £ 400 - a - month rented house in @entity262 , @entity14 , but he is a strangely proud man			2
‘ i ’m not on the dole , my mates are helping me out			0
i ’ve always found a way to support me and the kids			0
and , streaking or not , i will again			2
’ not that streaking has proved a big earner			2
‘ i made a couple of grand from underwear adverts in @entity271 ten years ago , ’ he says			0
he is also the star of a @entity273 documentary to be screened this week			1
so , unhappily , i joined him for his swansong – and he does have a point			0
there is , if our ad hoc audience is anything to go by , something inherently comical about two foftysomething blokes running across a park in the middle of february			0
as we thankfully reclaim our clothes after a streak that will be – for us both – our last , @entity5 says : ‘ that ’s it now , i ’m done			1
but you always want more out of life , do n’t you ? you never know what ’s on the other side of a door unless you open it			0
’ on the ball : mr @entity5 donned a tartan hat when he interrupted the @entity297 final between @entity298 and @entity299 in 2002			1
