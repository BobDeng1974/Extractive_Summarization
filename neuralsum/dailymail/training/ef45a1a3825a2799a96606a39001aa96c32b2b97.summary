on her bike : @entity2 leaves home on friday after quitting the @entity4 a topical joke by @entity7 whip @entity6 was repeated with glee in @entity9 yesterday			1
he said : ‘ when i saw the photo of @entity2 ’s house in @entity12 , i imagined she must have resigned over @entity14 ’s mansion tax , rather than a tweet			1
’ call it a cheap shot , if you wish			2
but it was a good one			2
for few @entity21 frontbenchers embodied the poisonous mixture of hypocrisy and elitism at the heart of the @entity14 machine quite so perfectly as ms @entity2			1
this wealthy barrister , who ( as consort to the @entity30 and @entity31 - educated judge sir @entity29 ) is properly known as ‘ @entity32 ’ , enjoys a rarefied existence beyond the wildest dreams of the working - class voters her party purports to represent			1
home is a vast , four - storey @entity39 townhouse in an exclusive @entity41 crescent beloved of lawyers and bankers , where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £ 2.9 million — £ 900,000 above the threshold for @entity21 ’s planned ‘ soak - the - rich ’ mansion tax			1
she and sir @entity29 , a barrister at @entity51 whose specialities included the lucrative — if controversial — field of off - shore trusts ( which , among other things , help rich people avoid taxes ) , bought the property in 1993 , two years after they married			1
they moved in during the same week as another great @entity62 power couple , @entity63 and @entity64			2
near neighbours in the street include @entity67 , the multi-millionairess @entity21 mp			0
aside from raising three children , @entity2 , 54 , has spent almost her entire time in the intervening 21 years navigating the moneyed , @entity41 - centric worlds of the @entity73 politics — a fact that helps to explain the extraordinary gaffe that led to her downfall			1
by sneering at @entity77 and his patriotism , she offered yet more evidence that , under @entity14 ’s leadership , the current @entity21 shamefully fails to connect with , or comprehend , its traditional supporters			0
one shocked @entity21 mp , @entity82 , described @entity2 ’s comments as ‘ derogatory and dismissive ’			1
another parliamentary colleague added : ‘ it ’s a typical cock up from one of this @entity12 cabal , who are terrified of stepping out of @entity41 and actually meeting @entity21 voters			1
it was a characteristically shameless move from a woman who , from the start of her political career , has betrayed a remarkable willingness to defend the indefensible			0
husband : @entity30 and @entity31 - educated judge sir @entity29 back in 2005 , for example , when @entity2 was seeking election for the first time in @entity109 and @entity110 , it was revealed that she had decided to snub the many inner - city comprehensive schools near her home in order to send her children to @entity116 ’s , a partially - selective state school			1
the school has some of the best gcse results in the country — but is situated some 13 miles away from @entity12 , in leafy @entity121 in @entity122			1
‘ i celebrate her good sense as a parent and deplore her hypocrisy as a politician , ’ commented @entity123 , the former chief inspector of schools			0
‘ when will those who espouse the virtues of comprehensive education apply the logic of their political message to their children ? ’ @entity2 responded , with a straight face , that there was nothing hypocritical about sending her offspring to @entity116 ’s because the school had originally been founded on a site near to her home , before moving to @entity121 in 1973			1
‘ in my opinion , it should never have left @entity12 , ’ she said			2
such a comment could have come straight out of the mouth of @entity145 ( for the @entity21 deputy leader famously , and with breathtaking hypocrisy , sent her own children to the selective schools she wanted to abolish for everyone else )			0
two years later , it was revealed that despite having repeatedly campaigned for more social housing to be provided in her constituency , @entity2 had used a spare £ 572,000 to buy a property in @entity155 from a housing association			1
she was then letting the terraced home on the private market			0
‘ this is not property speculation , ’ she said			2
‘ we are providing cheap and cheerful accommodation for some young people			0
’ @entity2 has also demonstrated , in her nine years in @entity164 , an uncanny knack of creating controversy			2
in 2006 , she was reported to the parliamentary commissioner for standards by the leader of @entity169 for allegedly being involved in foul play by trying to raise her own profile on @entity173 literature			0
the commissioner found her actions to be ‘ unwise and unfortunate ’ but not illegal			0
tweet : @entity2 mocks @entity77 with this ' sneering ' post on the social media website two years later , she fell out with the @entity179 after claiming that there were ‘ hardly any children in @entity12 who have not been mugged at some stage ’			1
the @entity179 pointed out , a mere 750 children ( out of a population of 170,000 ) had been mugged in the borough the previous year			0
in interviews , @entity2 , who often travels by bicycle , has repeatedly sought to deflect criticisms of the more controversial aspects of her gilded lifestyle by waxing lyrical about her supposedly - humble background			2
‘ my family , that i was brought up in , was fatherless and			0
my mother was on benefits and we lived in the council estate , ’ she said on @entity193 ’s @entity192 in 2012			0
@entity41 base : ms @entity2 's home in @entity12 ( plus flag ) , now worth roughly £ 2.9million that ’s true , but only up to a point			1
@entity2 was born and raised in prosperous @entity205			1
her father , @entity206 , was a renowned lawyer who became @entity208 assistant secretary general			0
her mother , @entity209 , was a teacher and @entity21 activist who served as a councillor and later mayor of @entity213 , where @entity2 now keeps a second rental property			1
at the age of seven , her parents divorced			0
she and her two younger brothers did , indeed , move into social housing with their mother			0
the exact circumstances of the marital split remain unknown			0
indeed , mention of her father is omitted from @entity2 ’s @entity225 entry , though he lived at her @entity12 address for a time in the @entity227			1
having failed the 11 - plus , @entity2 prospered at a @entity228 , going to the @entity229 , in @entity230			2
she was called to the bar in 1983 , and in 1985 joined @entity232 , where she worked in human rights law under the left - wing celebrity barrister @entity235 ( whose cases have included @entity237 and the @entity238 )			2
it was through work that she met her barrister husband , a second generation old boy of @entity243 , the exclusive £ 33,000 - a - year public school			1
( his father was a deputy high court judge for 15 years			0
) @entity29 ’s profile on the website of @entity248 lists among his specialities ‘ offshore trusts ’ and ‘ property law ’			2
they have two sons – aged 22 and 15 – and a 21 - year - old daughter			0
inspired by her mother , @entity2 stood for election as @entity21 mp in @entity12 in 2005 , having been parachuted into former cabinet minister @entity259 ’s safe seat via an all - woman shortlist			1
she did not go down well with voters , turning @entity259 ’s 7,000 majority into one of just 484 , but in @entity9 , her rise was rapid			0
a close friend – and kindred spirit – of fellow @entity267 @entity14 , she was made his parliamentary aide when he served as energy secretary in the last @entity21 government			0
after the 2010 election , she was reportedly the first mp to encourage him to challenge his brother @entity273 for leadership			0
rented out : the mp owns a £ 600,000 flat in @entity213 , @entity205 , above , which she bought in 2000 following his victory , she was duly given jobs on the shadow environment and care teams , before becoming shadow attorney general — a role in which she was regarded as one of his greatest loyalists			1
says one @entity9 insider : ‘ she was always happy to go on tv and radio to defend @entity289 ’ loyalty , it seems , was a one - way street			0
@entity14 acted swiftly to save his own skin on thursday night and to force her resignation			0
the last thing the beleaguered ‘ old - style @entity297 socialist ’ needed was a blundering ‘ @entity302 ’ to demonstrate how utterly out of touch his party is with so many @entity301 people			0
empire : in 2007 , the couple purchased a @entity306 property in @entity155 at auction for £ 572,000 , pictured above @entity2 was facing pressure last night over her controversial property holdings			1
the mp and her qc husband , sir @entity29 , live in an imposing @entity12 townhouse which they bought in 1993 and is now worth roughly £ 2.9million			1
at one time , @entity64 and @entity314 were their neighbours on the exclusive crescent , where yesterday a prankster had fixed an @entity320 flag to miss @entity2 ’s railings			2
in 2007 , the couple purchased a @entity306 property in @entity155 at auction for £ 572,000 – even though @entity325 had often called on @entity169 to build more homes and cut housing waiting lists			1
the property is said to be worth at least £ 1.2million			1
she also owns a £ 600,000 flat in @entity213 , @entity205 , which she says she bought for her mother in 2000 to ‘ free ’ her council house for a family			1
it is rented out , and while she has refused to reveal her income from the property , another flat in the building has a ‘ rental value ’ of £ 3,000 a month			1
the flat is overseen by a company called @entity340 ( @entity213 ) @entity341 , incorporated in 2004			1
@entity343 documents reveal a number of leases linked to other flats in the building			0
when questioned yesterday , the mp said she knew ‘ nothing ’ about the firm			0
but company documents reveal that she was appointed a director on april 9 , 2008 – the month that her mother died			0
she resigned on april 1 , 2010 – and was replaced by her husband			2
from 2007 to october 2010 , her parliamentary register of interests revealed that she had a ‘ one - fifth interest in a flat in @entity357 ’			2
this is not in her current register of interests , suggesting that the property has been sold			2
