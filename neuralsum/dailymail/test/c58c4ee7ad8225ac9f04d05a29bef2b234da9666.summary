nestled in eastern @entity0 is a sleepy little town called @entity2 where the streets have cozy names like @entity5 and @entity6 , names that hide a dark past : they once bore signs like @entity10 and @entity11			1
@entity2 , in the 1930s , appeared as a haven for @entity14 -- most of them of @entity16 heritage -- who sympathized with the causes of the @entity19			1
in fact , it was largely founded as a @entity19 camp , one of several scattered across the @entity14 , where the children in the @entity25 ( @entity26 ) could fish , swim , hunt and learn about things like eugenics			1
the group set up @entity42 camps where they could put on military demonstrations , teach their children about fascism and enjoy the outdoors today , @entity2 is still a town on @entity0			1
missing now , though , are the homes with swastikas built into the brick work and hedges , pro-hitler parades and , of course , the @entity19 camp			0
that camp was founded in 1935 by @entity55 , writes @entity56			0
that group went on to become the @entity25			2
the @entity25 in @entity2 , as it did in similar communities in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , organized military demonstrations where they waved both the @entity14 and @entity19 flags			1
in an article published in the @entity68 , @entity66 historian @entity65 describes a typical day at @entity38 thusly : ' locals from @entity2 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 visited the camp to drink beer , join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down @entity76 to salute @entity14 and @entity19 flags			1
' @entity65 writes that ' support for @entity19 in the @entity14 was a unique blend of @entity16 and @entity14 ideology rather than just a foreign import			0
' however , members had to be @entity83 and were united in their belief that those with @entity16 blood would lead @entity14 into a ' new era			0
' @entity10 street : @entity2 once had streets named @entity10 , @entity89 and @entity90 as well as @entity91 and @entity92			1
most of the names have since been changed , but the county still retains the original maps @entity98 hedge : gone now , too , are the swastikas that once adorned the lawns and buildings of the camp and town ' locals from @entity2 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 visited the camp to drink beer , join in the festive atmosphere walking or driving down @entity76 to salute @entity14 and @entity19 flags , ' notes @entity66 historian @entity65 in the years leading to @entity14 joining the @entity112 , the @entity110 and @entity111 police started to keep an eye on the @entity25 in @entity2			1
photos that only recently became available were mainly taken by @entity111 police and can be viewed here			0
the @entity110 once noted that @entity2 contained 150 to 300 children who ' used to wear a uniform like that of the @entity119 in @entity19			2
' things fell apart for the @entity25 in 1941 after the @entity14 declared war on @entity19 and open support of @entity10 became criminal			2
the bund 's leader @entity123 was imprisoned for tax evasion and embezzling and the group faded into obscurity			0
in @entity2 , @entity38 was shut down and taken over by the @entity130 league , which still runs it today , according to @entity132			0
the park is apparently for private use only			0
a @entity136 sign reads ' private community -- members and guests only			0
' the street names like @entity10 , @entity89 and @entity90 have gone			2
@entity141 is now @entity142 , @entity90 is now @entity5 and @entity89 is @entity143			1
@entity19 salute : in the run - up to 1941 , the @entity110 and @entity145 kept close tabs on the @entity148			0
the @entity110 once noted the @entity2 had 150 to 300 children who ' used to wear a uniform like that of the @entity119 in @entity19 '			2

@entity2 in @entity0 was founded in part by the @entity25 , a pro @entity19 group that flourished in the 1930s
they established @entity157 in 1935 as a place for like - minded @entity159 to drink beer , hold military demonstrations and learn about eugenics
@entity2 *remains* a town in @entity0 , but gone are the roads once called @entity141 , @entity89 and @entity90
