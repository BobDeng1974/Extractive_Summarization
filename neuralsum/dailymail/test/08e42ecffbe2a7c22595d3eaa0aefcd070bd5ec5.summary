@entity0 enhanced @entity2 ’s automatic promotion bid by equalling the club ’s record goal return of the modern era			1
@entity0 , the on - loan @entity6 forward , struck his 15th of the campaign , to match the tally of @entity11 @entity10 during the 1998 - 99 @entity13 season			1
no one has scored more in the 16 intervening years			0
his deflected 20th - minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation - threatened @entity17 , who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing @entity22 football just two years after shocking @entity23 in the @entity25 final at @entity26			1
@entity2 striker @entity0 , on loan from @entity6 , scores the opening goal via a deflection @entity0 celebrates his 17th goal of the season , the fourth that he has scored in his last four games @entity2 : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43			1

referee : @entity72 despite being five points adrift of safety , the @entity74 club arrived with an impressive away record , having taken 21 of their 35 points away from the @entity79 and winning their last four games on the road			0
however , no second - tier side have taken more points on their own turf than @entity2 and @entity0 made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the @entity87			1
it was from a classic counter-attack that @entity91 ’s team took the lead			0
a @entity17 free - kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as @entity33 dropped a high ball at the feet of @entity61 , whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the @entity2 goalkeeper			1
but @entity2 seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored			1
@entity38 ’s pass utilised @entity104 ’s pace and @entity2 were lucky when @entity43 ’s heavy touch from a right - wing cross set up @entity41			2
he curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off @entity17 defender @entity55 took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper @entity111			1
@entity35 plays the ball out of defence as @entity2 looked in control for long periods @entity104 gets dow the outside of @entity62 as @entity2 continued their promotion push despite @entity0 stealing the limelight , however , @entity2 head coach @entity91 praised the effort of his team			1
‘ it was a very important win and performance , especially second half			0
the most important thing is to win the games , to rest well and to think about monday ’s game , ’ said @entity91			0
‘ everything is going to be tighter			0
everyone is playing for something			0
@entity17 were playing to stay up and i think in all games someone has something to play for , so every game will be difficult			1
‘ everyone was tired after @entity135 and there were a lot of games in february and march			1
now after the break our heads are fresh and we have four games in the next two weeks			0
‘ we have experienced players and a lot of games coming up now , monday and saturday			0
there are six games to go and we need all of the players			0
‘ @entity0 scored the goal but there were other players who contributed all around the field			2
’ @entity0 is mobbed by his team - mates after the goal that sent @entity2 back to the top of the league @entity157 's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games @entity17 pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from @entity33 to keep out substitute @entity166 ’s effort just after the hour			1
‘ i ’m really disappointed that we did n’t get something out of the game , ’ said @entity17 manager @entity157			2
‘ especially in the second half we went toe to toe with @entity2 , one of the best teams in the division , and i am disappointed for my players for the courage they showed			2
’ @entity38 brings down @entity58 , but @entity17 never really threatened to take the points off their hosts things got particularly nervy in injury time when @entity17 — with four up front — were camped deep in home territory			2
@entity2 had their own chances to seal a more comfortable win but @entity104 volleyed wide at the climax of a stunning team move and substitute @entity48 , who coame on for @entity43 in the 67th minute , failed to get sufficient contact on a close - range effort seconds after entering the action			2
@entity48 wasted another opportunity deep into injury time when he slalomed his way down the field on a breakaway but his shot came off the heel of covering defender @entity54			0
but all @entity2 cared about was the three points .			0

@entity0 puts @entity2 ahead after 20 minutes
@entity0 's deflected shot takes @entity2 ahead of @entity135
*visitors* @entity17 remain in the relegation zone with six games to play
