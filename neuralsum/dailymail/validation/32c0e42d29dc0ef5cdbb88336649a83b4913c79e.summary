they have eluded explorers , hunters and scientists who have been searching the @entity5 mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century			1
now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the @entity14			2
a key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the @entity5 has now been ruled out			1
this footprint taken by @entity24 explorer @entity22 in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved biologists used dna analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear			1
instead they have found that the dna in the hair samples has degraded making it impossible to attribute them to any species of bear			1
the first accounts of @entity14 emerged before the 19th century from @entity47 who believed that the creature inhabited the @entity5			1
they depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound			0
the term @entity14 was developed in 1921 following a book by lieutenant - colonel @entity59 called @entity60			0
popular interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the @entity14			0
they reported seeing strange markings in the snow			0
the @entity69 led a trip called the the @entity71 in 1954 to @entity72			0
during the trip mountaineering leader @entity73 photographed ancient paintings of yetis and large footprints in the snow			0
a number of hair samples were also found that were believed to have come from a yeti scalp			1
@entity24 mountaineer @entity83 claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling @entity85 in 1970			2
he said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a @entity14 's call			0
that night , he saw a dark shape moving near his camp			0
the researchers conclude , however , that from the colour and shape of the hair samples , they were likely to have come from common @entity5 brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear			1
this means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery			1
dr @entity104 , an evolutionary biologist at the @entity105 , said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters			1
he said : ' we have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than @entity115			0
' what strikes us as odd is that an “ experienced hunter ” , who was very familiar with the @entity115 , could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear of some sort and , specifically , for a “ yeti ”			1
' corroboration and documentation of , as well as other information concerning , the anecdote of this bear being shot by the hunter and the subsequent history of the hair that was saved would be most welcome			1
' in 2014 professor @entity133 , a geneticist at the @entity134 , found that @entity135 extracted two samples of ' yeti ' hair from the @entity5 were a 100 per cent match with a 40,000 year old fossil polar bear but not to modern species of polar bear			1
however , subsequent analysis by researchers from the @entity145 found that the hair was not from a polar bear			1
professor @entity133 and his colleagues maintained , however , that the hair samples must be from an otherwise unknown species of bear living in the @entity5			1
although no dna match was found the researchers say it is likely yeti hair samples came from a brown bear an artists reconstruction of what a yeti may look like based on reports and descriptions from past sightings now dr @entity104 and dr @entity165 , a zoologist at the @entity166 , have found that the dna from the samples can not be assigned to any species of bear			1
writing in the journal @entity172 , they said : ' the molecular data obtained and analyzed by @entity133 are not informative enough to suggest the possibility that a taxonomically unrecognized type of bear exists in the @entity5			1
1832 : a book on trekker @entity179 's experiences in @entity181 recalls the sighting of a tall , bipedal creature covered in long dark hair			2
mr @entity185 concluded it was an orangutan			0
1899 : @entity187 reports his guides seeing an ape - like creature and seeing footprints			0
he suspects they spotted a bear			2
1925 : @entity193 , a photographer , wrote that he saw a creature in the @entity5 that was walking upright like a human , was dark coloured , and wore no clothes			1
1951 : @entity22 captured images of what some believe is a @entity14 footprint			0
1948 : @entity201 claimed to have discovered a @entity14 footprint in @entity203			2
1953 : sir @entity204 reported seeing large footprints while scaling @entity72			0
he discounted @entity14 reports as unreliable			0
1954 : mountaineering leader @entity73 photographed symbolic paintings of the @entity14 along with many sets of footprints in @entity181 , some of which could not be identified			0
1959 : supposed @entity14 feces were collected and analysed			0
they were found to contain a parasite that could not be identified			2
1959 : actor @entity215 , while visiting @entity203 , reportedly smuggled @entity14 remains to @entity216			0
1960 : sir @entity204 mounted an expedition to collect and analyse physical evidence of the @entity14			0
1970 : @entity24 mountaineer @entity83 claimed to have witnessed a creature while scaled @entity85			2
1983 : @entity222 and @entity223 led a @entity14 expedition into @entity181 's @entity225 where footprints were discovered			0
1996 : a hoax @entity14 movie called @entity228 was aired			0
2007 : @entity231 tv programme @entity229 reported finding @entity14 - like footprints in the @entity72 region			0
2008 : the @entity234 reported that hairs collected in @entity203 were tested , but results about what creature it came from were inconclusive			0
2008 : @entity239 adventures photographed footprints thought to have been left by a @entity14			0
2011 : at a conference in @entity244 , scientists and enthusiasts claimed to have 95 per cent proof of the @entity14 's existence			1
it was later claimed to be a publicity stunt			2
2011 : a hunter claims to have spotted a bear - like creature trying to kill one of his sheep in @entity244			2
2013 : @entity24 climber @entity253 captures an image of footprints in the @entity5 thought to offer further proof of the @entity14 's existence			1
2014 : a video of a ' hairy figure ' is captured stumbling through a forest in @entity244 ' we emphasize that no evidence has ever been presented to suggest that an unknown bear species occurs in the @entity5 as part of their study , dr @entity104 and dr @entity165 examined how gene sequences can reveal the relationships between the six present - day species of bears			1
they found one sequence from an @entity275 from @entity239 indicated that it was not closely related to the mainland members of that species			1
professor @entity133 insisted that the findings from the new study did not invalidate his own findings			0
he said : ' what mattered most to our project was that these two hairs were definitely not from unknown primates			2
' the explanation by @entity289 and @entity165 might be right , or it might not be			0
' the only way forward , as i have repeatedly said , is to find a living bear that matches the @entity294 and and study fresh material from it			2
' which involves getting off your butt , not an activity i usually associate with desk - bound molecular taxonomists			0
' last year , in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years , professor @entity133 from the @entity134 analysed 30 samples of hair			1
the hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis , or their bigfoot cousins , and were part of museum and private collections from around the world			0
twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons , horses and cows			2
but two did not fit the mould			0
their dna matched that recovered from a 40,000 - year - old polar bear fossil			1
one hair was reddish brown and found in a @entity14 nest in a bamboo forest in @entity329 , ten years ago			1
the second was golden brown and taken from a @entity14 in @entity332 on the @entity334 - @entity203 border 40 years ago			1
but new research suggests professor @entity133 's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data			2
researchers @entity341 , from the @entity145 , and @entity342 from the @entity134 looked at the same hair samples that led professor @entity133 to make his bold claim			2
they proposed that the previously unexplained samples come from the @entity5 bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the @entity5 , in remote , mountainous areas of @entity352 , @entity181 , @entity334 , @entity329 and @entity203			1
the latest research , however , concludes that it is difficult to attribute the dna to any species of bear .			1

latest research dismisses theories that yeti is an unknown species of bear
scientists had claimed dna from ' yeti ' hair found in the @entity5 matched the genetic sequence from a fossil polar bear that died 40,000 years ago
they claimed that the hair may belong to an undiscovered species of bear
the new research concludes the hair may belong to a common brown bear
but scientists are baffled how hunters *confused* the fur with hair of a yeti
