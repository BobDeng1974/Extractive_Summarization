there was a match during @entity4 ’s @entity3 - winning campaign last season against @entity6 when @entity7 twice spat in his gloved hand then threw the phlegm at @entity10			1
the defender was , understandably , incensed by the revolting act , but it was done so discreetly the referee was unable to punish the striker			0
during the game he lightly rocks his head — just short of a head - butt — into @entity10 , slaps him , and verbally winds up @entity20 several times			0
at the end of the game , they hug and make up			0
@entity7 ( right ) had a reputation for coming to blows with opponents before he joined @entity27 despite @entity7 's controversial characteristics , his scoring ability also followed from @entity4 to @entity27 @entity7 ( left ) joined @entity27 from the @entity30 champions @entity4 last summer @entity31 ( right ) , a defender , followed @entity7 to @entity32 from @entity33 last summer @entity7 is football ’s ultimate machiavellian character , one who would give @entity38 ’s @entity37 a run for his money when it comes to the subtle dark arts of manipulation			1
‘ @entity7 has been playing like this since he started playing football , ’ explains @entity31 , who spent four years as his team - mate at @entity4 before the pair moved over to @entity46 within a day of each other last summer			1
’ @entity50 ’s defenders beware ; they are in for a bumpy ride when they face @entity27 at @entity52 this afternoon			1
a month into the season @entity7 escaped a ban despite putting his hands around @entity57 ’s neck			1
both players were booked but the @entity60 defender was sent off for a second yellow card			0
the striker was not , however , so fortunate in the second leg of @entity27 ’s @entity65 semi-final win against @entity66 , when he was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on @entity70			1
he also caught @entity71 with his studs			0
but @entity31 has a different interpretation than most of @entity7 ’s actions			1
‘ he is not violent or aggressive , he is intense , ’ he says			0
@entity7 ( right ) escaped punishment for landing his studs on the leg of @entity66 defender @entity71 @entity7 ( centre ) confronts @entity79 defender @entity78 ( left ) during @entity27 's draw with @entity79 @entity27 manager @entity81 has been incensed with the treatment of @entity7 this season ‘ he tries to win all the balls in any way possible			1
that ’s the kind of players we need and we have that in the team			2
i do n’t think reputation means anything			0
’ alongside @entity7 ’s goals — he scored a phenomenal 35 in 46 games last season — this mentality is what persuaded @entity27 owner @entity97 to lighten his wallet by £ 32million in july			1
missing three matches has left @entity7 stilted and without a goal in the two games he has played since his return			2
@entity31 , however , is convinced his team - mate is now back to match fitness , making him ready to inflict his might on @entity50			1
@entity7 has been playing like this , as @entity31 says , since he gained his footballing education on the streets of @entity110 in one of @entity113 ’s most impoverished regions			2
a boy playing among men , he learned to use his physicality to score goals			0
the experience grew his fiercely competitive and combative nature			0
‘ he always wants to win , in training , in video games , in cards , everywhere he plays he wants to win , ’ @entity31 adds			0
‘ everybody here at @entity27 has this ambition			2
to get to a big club like @entity27 you have to have this ambition inside you , so @entity7 is not an exception			1
@entity7 ( right ) pictured in action in @entity27 's 5 - 3 defeat to @entity132 on @entity133 @entity7 will hope to be celebrating his first trophy on @entity136 shores with the @entity138 final at @entity52 ‘ every minute he plays he gives everything			1
everybody knows him , he always tries to win , he tries to help the team			2
he plays for the team , he does n’t play for himself			0
that ’s the kind of player that helps @entity27 to be champions			1
‘ of course he is going to be in the best way for the game because he is a striker , he is joint top - scorer in the league right now ( on 17 with @entity150 ) , he wants cups , he is ambitious , so that ’s why i am so proud to play with him			0
’ @entity81 seeks winners to bring home trophies			0
today could bring the first of many in his second spell in charge			0
@entity7 is prepared to win it			2

@entity7 has been controversial and *brilliant* in his time at @entity27
he *signed* for the team from @entity30 league champions @entity4
@entity7 will look to lift his first piece of *silverware* in @entity136 in the @entity65 final against @entity50 on *sunday*
