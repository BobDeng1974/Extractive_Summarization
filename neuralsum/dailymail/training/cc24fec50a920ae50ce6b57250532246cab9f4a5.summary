by @entity0 as the chief crown prosecutor for the @entity3 , i led the teams that brought the so - called @entity5 to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls			1
my work saw me go up against not only the offenders , but those who tried to intimidate me for bringing abusers before the courts			2
they said i had given racists a stick with which to beat minorities – i said our communities should be carrying their own sticks			1
far - right extremists targeted me , too			2
i had made these @entity22 - @entity21 men pay for abusing vulnerable girls – but that damaged the racists ’ narrative that all minorities are the same			1
to their hateful demands for me to be ‘ sacked and deported ’ , i gave the simple response : i was born in @entity30			1
@entity31 , chief crown prosecutor for the @entity3 , pictured , said he does not care about the race of a child abuser as long as they are stopped and brought to justice			1
' ethnicity is an issue not the issue ' the network of prosecutors i lead has tackled grooming and child sexual abuse in @entity43 and @entity44 for the past two years			1
we are advising about hundreds of suspects while , at the same time , protecting hundreds of victims			2
in one operation alone by @entity50 there are 20 potential victims and 180 suspects			2
the problem we identified in @entity5 was that justice was prevented from being delivered because the credibility of the young victims was questioned			2
if we do n’t believe a young , vulnerable girl , who will ? the authorities and communities appeared to have turned a blind eye to the abuse of its children			1
the ethnicity of many of the abusers in @entity66 , @entity5 and other places is a matter of fact – they were from @entity71 or @entity21 backgrounds			2
i do not care where they come from as long as they are stopped and brought to justice			0
i told @entity77 in 2012 that the ethnicity of the perpetrators was an issue , not the issue			0
it was not the abusers ’ race that defined them , but their attitude to women and girls			0
they targeted girls because of their vulnerability , and failings by those who should have safeguarded them			0
there is no excuse for what the abusers did , nor is there any excuse for the authorities to choose not to believe and protect them			1
@entity102 , pictured , was one of the nine men found guilty of being part of the @entity5 child abuse ring responsibility for the abuse begins and ends with the criminals who commit these acts			1
there is , however , an individual and collective duty to report what you suspect and to act to protect these vulnerable youngsters			0
yet now the @entity21 communities have woken up to the criminals in their midst			0
they recognise they can do more to stop this offending			0
there is , sadly , no community where women and girls are not at risk from sexual predators			0
the @entity126 has prosecuted people from over 25 countries , excluding those from outside the @entity129 , for sexual offences and trafficking in the past three years			0
abusers are of all nationalities , ethnicities and ages , though the vast majority are white @entity22 males			0
tragically , another girl will have been abused in the time it has taken to read this article			0
other children will have been targeted for future abuse			1
but we and others have learnt from the past			0
we can not shy away from tackling child sexual abuse regardless of where it occurs and by whom			1
multicultural sensitivity is no excuse for our blindness			1
i believe it is time for the criminals to be in fear .			0
