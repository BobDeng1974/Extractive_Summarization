face of a princess ? a 3d computer model of the face of @entity4 made from remains discovered in @entity6 which archaeologists believe were hers an archaeologist who claimed to have found the bones of @entity12 's murdered half - sister says they are pinning their hopes on new forensic techniques to conclusively identify the remains			1
it was claimed that the remains of princess @entity4 , who was murdered more than 2,000 years ago on the orders of @entity23 's queen @entity12 , were the first relics of the @entity26 dynasty to be identified			1
but rival experts have since said the evidence linking the bones to the princess is largely circumstantial , and even the researcher who found them admits they have been handled too many times to get a reliable dna test result			1
nevertheless , dr @entity34 , from the @entity36 @entity35 , who made the discovery , remains convinced that they belonged to the classical - era @entity23 royal			1
princess @entity4 's purported remains were found in a tomb in @entity6 , a large and important ancient @entity43 city on the coast of @entity45 , in what is now modern - day western @entity47			1
she was @entity12 's younger sister or half - sister			0
it is believed both were fathered by @entity51 , but whether they shared a mother is unclear			0
still , however closely they were related by blood , there was no love lost between @entity4 and her powerful sister			1
a power struggle between @entity12 and her brother @entity60 , in which the legendary seductress enlisted the help of @entity64 , saw the younger sister join the @entity23 army to resist @entity68 's legions , @entity58 reported			1
after @entity12 's victory with @entity68 's help , @entity4 was taken captive and allowed to live in exile in @entity6			1
but , it is believed , the @entity23 queen continued to see her younger sister as a threat			1
after @entity64 's assassination , she persuaded her new lover , @entity77 , to have @entity4 murdered in @entity78			2
two - thousand years later , in 1904 , archaeologists excavating @entity6 found a ruined structure which they dubbed the @entity81 after its unusual shape			1
further digs in 1926 revealed a grave chamber within the @entity81 , inside of which were found the bones of a woman judged to be about 20 years old			2
dr @entity34 , who is an expert in ancient architecture , told the @entity90 : ' when i was working with the architecture of @entity81 and the building next to it , it was n’t known whose skeleton was inside			2
' then i found some ancient writers telling us that in the year 41 @entity98 , @entity4 – the half - sister of @entity12 – was murdered in @entity6 by @entity12 and her @entity99 lover , @entity77			1
' because the building is dated by its type and decoration to the second half of the first century @entity105 , this fits quite well			0
' that clue combined with the fact that in ancient times only special people were buried within cities themselves , the octagonal shape which resembles the @entity112 , and the fact the bones are female , left her convinced the bones were those of the @entity23 princess			1
tourists visit the ruins of @entity6 : after @entity12 's victory with @entity68 's help , @entity4 was taken captive and allowed to live in exile in the city until her murder apparently on the orders of @entity77 in @entity78 the initial opening to the burial chamber was small , and the @entity36 team which first excavated took away only the skull , which was lost in @entity131 during the @entity132			1
but then , in 1985 , the back side of the chamber became accessible and dr @entity34 rediscovered the rest of the skeleton			2
unfortunately for dr @entity34 , the discovery led to the first major blow to her theory			0
forensic analysis of the bones showed they belonged to a girl no older than 15 or 16 - which seems young for a woman said to have played a big role in ancient geo - politics			2
the discovery of shoes deliberately hidden in an ancient @entity23 temple has left archaeologists baffled , not least because they include design features thought to have been invented in @entity153			1
two pairs of tiny children 's shoes were among the seven found concealed in a jar placed into a cavity between two mudbrick walls in a temple in @entity161 , site of the ancient city of @entity163			1
oddly , they were tied together using palm fibre string and placed within a single adult shoe			0
a third pair that had been worn by an adult was found alongside them			0
but there is no clue as to why the shoes , which would have been costly and unusual footwear for the era , were never retrieved after they were left in the temple just over 2,000 years ago when @entity23 was ruled by a dynasty of @entity43 descent			1
research has shown that at least one of them includes structural elements that historians had previously believed were not invented until the @entity153 era , which began in @entity184 some 500 years later			0
at the time the shoes were concealed , most @entity23 would normally have worn sandals			2
a @entity188 documentary in 2009 nevertheless trumpeted dr @entity34 's claims that the bones belonged to @entity4 , and used measurements taken before the skull was lost to reconstruct her face			1
she told the @entity195 at the time : ' the results of the forensic examination and the fact that the facial reconstruction shows that @entity4 had an @entity202 mother is a real sensation			2
' presenter and archaeologist @entity203 was equally gushing , saying at the time : ' @entity12 , @entity64 , @entity77 ... they are all iconic figures from history			0
' it 's almost impossible to remember they were real people and not the semi-mythical figures portrayed by @entity212 and @entity213			0
' it was like a splash of cold water in the face to be confronted by them as human beings			0
' when i stood in the lab and handled the bones of @entity12 's blood sister - knowing that in her lifetime she touched @entity12 and perhaps @entity64 and @entity77 as well - i felt the hairs go up on the back of my neck			2
' suddenly these giant figures from history were flesh and blood			0
' but despite a string of excitable headlines reporting the findings , other researchers were sceptical about the judgements of the woman 's ethnicity and , indeed , her true identity			0
' we get this skull business and having @entity4 's ethnicity actually being determined from a reconstructed skull based on measurements taken in the 1920s ? ' wrote @entity246 , a @entity247 classicist and teacher , on his blog rogueclassicism			2
dr @entity34 admits that dna tests she and her colleagues tried to carry out on the remains were less than satisfactory			0
she told the @entity90 : ' they tried to make a dna test , but testing did n’t work well because the skeleton had been moved and the bones had been held by a lot of people			1
it did n’t bring the results we hoped to find			0
' i do n’t know if there are possibilities to do more of this testing			0
forensic material is not my field			0
' one of my colleagues on the project told me two years ago there currently is no other method to really determine more			0
but he thinks there may be new methods developing			0

bones have been handled too many times for a conclusive dna test
but the researcher who found them *maintains* that they are those of @entity23 princess @entity4
they were found in 1985 in a ruined temple in the ancient @entity43 city of @entity6 , in what is now western @entity47
