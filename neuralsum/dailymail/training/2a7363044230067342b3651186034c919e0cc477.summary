by @entity0 @entity3 your beer belly is off the menu in @entity5 this summer , as visitors to the @entity8 funfair are being told to please keep their clothes on			1
the park 's new ' @entity12 ' rule will be enforced no matter how high the temperatures rise , and has been inspired by similiar dress codes used in @entity16 theme parks which urge men to stay covered up in a bid to maintain family - friendly standards			1
a spokesman for the park said : ' we do n’t have a strict dress code as such , but would like our male customers to show some decorum			0
not welcome : funfair @entity8 in @entity5 is banning bare chests this summer ' in recent years , we ’ve seen increasing numbers of lads and men whipping their tops off , eager to make the most of the sun – which is understandable , of course , as @entity5 is the warmest and driest part of the @entity36			1
' that ’s absolutely fine in the right environment , but we try very hard to be a family - focused business and not everybody is a fan of bare chests			0
' we simply want to make sure that @entity8 maintains its status as the best place to bring the whole family for a fun , safe , reasonably - priced great day out			1
' have some decorum : @entity47 , managing director , has instructed signs to be posted around the park signs are now being put up around the park and security staff will politely challenge individuals who have removed their tops and ask them to put them back on again			0
those who refuse will be asked to leave			0
mr @entity47 added : ' of course , we do n’t want people to think we ’re introducing a nightclub - style policy of no jeans or trainers			0
there definitely wo n’t be @entity8 fashion police criticising people for wearing double denim combinations , spots with stripes or inappropriate shades of purple			2
' we ’ll simply point out that if you want to pose semi-naked , then @entity5 has miles of glorious beaches on which to do that			2
' family - friendly : the theme park insists it wants to maintain standards , not play the role of the fashion police			2
