it 's a key question to consider when making a hotel booking - do you want a lot of everything or the best of a few things ? as @entity8 launched its first venue in @entity10 , @entity11 last week , it was clear that this kind of question provides the thinking behind its brand			1
to find out what guests really want , @entity11 - based hotel group glh conducted research over the last two years , most recently asking 4,000 adults globally what matters most when staying in a hotel			1
each room at @entity8 ' new location in @entity10 boasts a @entity26 bed and a complimentary mini-bar top three were a great night 's sleep ( 86 per cent ) , no hidden extras ( 81 per cent ) and fast and efficient check - in ( 67 per cent )			1
turning its back on the traditional hotel rating system , @entity8 is striving to meet the demands of guests looking for fully - equipped bedrooms in hotels without meeting rooms , spas or a plethora of restaurants and bars			2
the company has stripped back all the non-room features usually found in four - star hotels , and instead focuses on quality rooms and a personal service			0
the @entity10 venture is the first to open in @entity11 , with sites in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 next on the agenda			1
every @entity8 has opened its first @entity11 location in @entity10 , with three others planned @entity56 stayed the night to see whether they 'd got the balance just right			1
@entity10 offers modern , well - equipped rooms with @entity26 beds , @entity61 machines , complimentary mini-bar , free wifi , a great location , hosts genuinely knowledgeable about the local area and the opportunity to choose your room before you arrive			1
what strikes me is that senior executives involved with the project are very realistic ; in the sense that they recognise there are many restaurants and bars to choose from in central @entity11 , that tourists will spend most of their time walking around , and that most businessmen will have office meetings in offices			1
and so the focus is on the accommodation , the comfort , and having facilities that do n't force themselves onto guests			0
the company 's research showed them that 52 per cent of @entity90 wanted a @entity61 machine in the room my deluxe room is spacious and bright with a clean and sharp finish			2
the complimentary mini-bar is a nice touch			1
with stunning views of the heart of @entity11 , yet with soundproofing giving a great night 's sleep , the rooms provide that well - deserved luxury after a day out traipsing the streets			2
the company 's research showed them that 52 per cent of @entity90 wanted a @entity61 machine in the room , and 41 per cent demanded a @entity106 - so these are standard throughout			2
@entity107 , ceo @entity8 , said : ' what came out loud and clear was that guests wanted a great room with great tech , in a great location			1
' what is really important to today 's guests , regardless of whether they are travelling for business or pleasure , is they do n't want any hidden surprises			0
' so , not only is our wifi complimentary , but so are our mini-bars , @entity61 machines , printing facilities and in room entertainment			1
' rooms offer views of the heart of @entity11 , with soundproofing to ensure a great night 's sleep you wo n't find just one person at the reception having to handle a queue of customers			2
nor will you see members of staff who see their role as simply ' a job '			0
smiles are in abundance , from the moment i checked - in to when i ordered a beer from the bar			0
the staff are as excited as senior management to see how the new venue fares in an ultra-competitive market			0
@entity151 , ceo of glh , added : ' we believe we conduct more research than anyone our size , we do this to help us better understand the modern traveller , who has a new set of expectations			0
' the hotel is hoping its varied breakfast can set it ahead of its rivals in @entity11			2
a delightful selection of fruit , breads and yoghurt compliments an extensive hot food selection			0
crisp and steaming bacon , and wholesome sausages form the main part of the traditional fry - up			0
and as it 's all - you - can eat it would be rude not to fill up , right ? every hotels @entity178 , @entity11			0
