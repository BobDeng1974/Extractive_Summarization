by @entity0 published : 19:41 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 01:54 est , 26 july 2013 desperate for some relief from the sweltering heat ? forget cold showers or huddling around a fan — just head to a supermarket			1
because when the mercury rises outside , you can guarantee that your local store will be positively @entity9			2
but far from shoppers enjoying the bracing air , many — especially those clad in light , summer clothes — complain that supermarkets are too cold for comfort			2
chilly : in a bid to find out just how cold our supermarkets are , @entity0 tested the temperature of eight big - name stores near her @entity23 home while the temperate climes of the ‘ bread , cakes and biscuits ’ aisle may feel relatively comfortable , it ’s a different story once you reach the frozen wastes of the ‘ fresh vegetables ’ section			1
most of these are much colder than the @entity36 at the moment — the @entity38 in @entity39 , which lie 100 miles inside it , were a comparatively balmy 18c ( 64f ) yesterday			2
and who can make tricky decisions about fancy purple sprouting broccoli and @entity47 cabbage when your teeth are chattering uncontrollably and your hands are numbing into icy claws around the handles of your shopping basket ? while @entity56 guidelines recommend that supermarkets maintain a temperature of 19 - 21c ( 66 - 70f ) in winter , and 21 - 23c ( 70 - 73f ) in summer , the major chains are often far colder , because they refuse to put doors on all their freezers and chillers — claiming shoppers are put off by viewing food behind glass			1
aside from the discomfort suffered by shoppers as a result of this , super-chilling tens of thousands of cavernous supermarkets is having a significant impact on the environment			2
indeed , one study claimed that if all the @entity56 ’s supermarkets put doors on their fridges , the electricity saved would be roughly double the output of the gigantic @entity79 power station in @entity80			2
in a bid to find out just how cold our supermarkets are , i tested the temperature of eight big - name stores near my @entity23 home			1
armed with a sensitive digital thermometer , i went to the fresh salads / sandwiches aisles , the fresh meat aisles and freezer - cabinet aisles — with surprising results			1
how do your supermarket ’s chillier aisles compare ? @entity97 i have long held a theory that posh equals cold when it comes to supermarkets — and @entity97 backs my theory to the hilt			1
it ’s so cold that i feel like building base camp next to the biscuits , and sending the photographer into the @entity9 wastes alone			0
freezing : @entity97 proved to be extremely cold			0
this is a file picture of a store but while i loathe the cold , and wish the store would give us all a break and put everything behind glass doors , some shoppers like the reassurance of feeling the force of @entity97 refrigeration			0
‘ it means the food is n’t about to go off , ’ says grandmother @entity120 , 74			0
‘ i would n’t trust a warm supermarket			1
’ our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 13.6c ( 56.5f ) fresh meat aisle : 13.2c ( 55.7f ) freezer aisle : 13.7c ( 56.7f ) average temperature : 13.5c ( 56.3f ) @entity97 says : ‘ we try to main an average temperature of 16c ( 61f ) in the food hall area , but there will be some areas that are made colder by the refrigeration units			1
’ chill factor : bring out the quilted sleeping bags ! 7/8 @entity136 positively balmy after @entity97 but it still falls below the recommended temperature			1
shelf - stacker @entity139 would love it to warm up a bit			1
‘ i spend all day in protective gloves to stop my hands getting too cold , ’ he sighs			0
‘ and look at me wearing a fleece in @entity146			0
‘ it really does n’t need to be this cold			0
it would be logical to put doors on all the cold units			0
after all , imagine leaving your fridge and freezer doors open at home ! ’ our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 19.8c ( 67.7f ) meat aisle : 13.8c ( 56.8f ) freezer aisle : 19.8c ( 67.6f ) average temperature : 17.8c ( 64f ) @entity136 says : ‘ there is no policy on ambient air temperature			1
the chillers have to be kept at a certain temperature to keep produce fresh , so where large numbers of chillers are together , the air will feel colder			1
’ chill factor : @entity173 definitely required ( although no imminent danger of frostbite )			0
5/8 @entity176 part - time therapist and @entity176 customer @entity177 , 60 , says while wearing a cardigan to combat the chill : ‘ if you think of the environment , expending all this energy to cool a whole supermarket instead of just a few fridges is very silly			1
‘ yet , if i ’m honest , one reason i shop here is because everything looks so lovely and fresh			0
‘ would that be the case if the shop was warmer ? ’ cold : @entity176 stores should probably have a ' no flip - flops ' warning , says @entity0 our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 17.8c ( 64.1f ) meat aisle : 13.1c ( 55.6f ) freezer aisle : 15.3c ( 59.5f ) average temperature : 15.4c ( 59.7f ) @entity176 says : ‘ the majority of branches ’ heating and ventilation are controlled by a computerised @entity200			1
' the recommended temperature is 19c ( @entity206 )			1
it may be slightly higher in summer due to air temperature			1
’ chill factor : in addition to the ‘ no dogs ’ and ‘ no smoking ’ signs outside , @entity176 stores should probably have a ‘ no flip - flops ’ warning			1
' i wore mine and lost the feeling in my little toes somewhere near the display of @entity223 - aged @entity222			1
6/8 @entity224 according to my theory about poshness and coldness , budget stores such as @entity224 should be warmer than their middle - class rivals			1
maybe it ’s because the freezers in this supermarket are completely enclosed			1
or maybe shoppers here are n’t as worried about aesthetics as they are in @entity176			0
the store is still a smidgen below the official recommended temperature , though			1
our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 19.6c ( 67.3f ) meat aisle : 19.8c ( 67.6f ) freezer aisle : 15c ( 59f ) average temperature : 18.1c ( 64.6f ) @entity224 says : ‘ we do regulate the store temperatures through a @entity200 , according to set guidelines and specifications			1
' we have a minimum and maximum temperature for each area of the store , from 19 - 24c ( 66 - 75f ) for the sales area to 20 - 24c ( 68 - 75f ) for the checkouts			1
’ chill factor : @entity224 sells less perishable and fresh produce than stores like @entity97 , so it follows it would be warmer			1
but maybe the more upmarket supermarkets should take a leaf out of @entity224 ’s book when it comes to enclosing the freezers			0
3/8 @entity264 ‘ the cold in some supermarkets does put me off , but this one is n’t too bad , ’ says shopper @entity265 , 34			0
‘ you would n’t want to be sitting around in here but it ’s fine to shop in			0
’ safe : you can safely shop for your barbecue food in @entity264 without risking hypothermia our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 18.6c ( 65.4f ) meat aisle : 15.9c ( 60.7f ) freezer aisle : 20.9c ( 69.7f ) average temperature : 18.5c ( 65.3f ) @entity264 says : ‘ we do not have a specific set of guidelines for store temperatures			2
the areas we refer to as “ market street ” sections — the bakery , fishmonger , butcher and greengrocer — feel cold because of the cold air given off by the produce tables ( chilled from below ) and the more traditional vertical produce - display units			2
’ chill factor : the aisles containing fresh and perishable produce are ( on average ) just 4f off the recommended temperatures			0
you can safely shop for your barbecue food here without risking hypothermia			0
2/8 @entity305 the @entity306 of the supermarket world ! budget store @entity305 is the @entity56 ’s warmest supermarket , with temperatures in the coldest sections just about reaching the recommended average			2
our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 20.5c ( 68.9f ) meat aisle : 20.2c ( 68.4f ) freezer aisle : 22.2c ( 71.9f ) average temperature : 21c ( 69.73f ) @entity305 says : ‘ the temperature of our stores is managed on a local basis by the store managers			1
' this helps to provide the right environment to ensure the quality of our ambient and fresh produce , as well as creating a comfortable shopping experience for all our customers			0
’ chill factor : minimal			0
you may not be wowed by @entity305 ’s selection of budget ice cream , but at least you ’ll maintain the feeling in your extremities while you ’re perusing it			0
1/8 @entity335 ‘ it ’s freezing in here ! ’ complains housewife @entity336 , 46 , who is clutching her jacket across her chest for warmth			0
checkout girl @entity341 agrees heartily			0
‘ it ’s even worse in winter , ’ she says			0
‘ they call the cold store out the back @entity346 , and bits of the main store are n’t much better			0
’ freezing : @entity335 proved to be too cold for comfort for our writer our findings : salads / sandwich aisles : 21.3c ( 70.3f ) meat aisles : 14.7c ( 58.5f ) freezers aisles : 12.8c ( 55f ) average temperature : 16.3c ( 61.3f ) @entity335 says : ‘ the temperature of our stores is controlled centrally but can be tweaked store by store if needed			1
in winter we heat the stores up to 19c ( 66f ) , and in summer cool them to 24c ( 75f )			2
’ chill factor : too cold for comfort			0
try turning up the thermostat will you ? 5/8 @entity367 ’s i ’m surprised i manage to take notes in @entity367 ’s — it is so cold i expect the ink in my pen to freeze			0
@entity373 is the only way to describe it			0
and fellow shopper @entity375 , 35 , who is on maternity leave from her job in publishing , says she hates bringing her ten - month - old baby daughter into the store , even with a blanket			2
‘ the massive temperature difference between the air outside and in here ca n’t be good for her , ’ she says			2
our findings : salads / sandwich aisle : 13.8c ( 56.8f ) meat aisle : 6.2c ( 43.1f ) freezer aisle : 14.2c ( 57.5f ) average aisle : 11.4c ( 52.47f ) @entity367 ’s says : ‘ the temperatures in our stores vary depending where you are , with the produce and frozen sections generally colder			2
’ chill factor : brrr ! we found @entity367 ’s to be the @entity56 ’s coldest supermarket			2
