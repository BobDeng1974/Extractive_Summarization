@entity2 achieved ' very very little ' in his role as @entity5 peace envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region , a former senior @entity1 diplomat said last night			1
@entity8 , the former ambassador to @entity9 , said mr @entity2 was the ' wrong man ' who had ' not been able to do the job '			1
other critics branded mr @entity2 's role a ' fig leaf ' and said his role in the @entity15 made it impossible for him to do the job			1
@entity2 achieved little in his role as @entity5 envoy and should withdraw from political activity in the region , a former @entity1 diplomat has said he said the role , as the representative of the quartet of the @entity27 , the @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 , was a ' convenient excuse for doing nothing ' and that was what he had achieved			1
mr @entity2 has been the envoy for the four peace negotiators since shortly after he stepped down as prime minister in 2007			1
in that time , the @entity33 has received a total of £ 20million in funding , mostly from the @entity23 and @entity21			0
mr @entity2 is not paid for the role			1
his office did not confirm the reports yesterday that he was planning to ' step back ' from the job			2
it is thought an announcement is due later this week			0
there was no official reaction to the speculation about his change of role yesterday in @entity47 or the @entity23 , and @entity48 refused to comment on the speculation			2
a @entity48 spokesman would say only that the @entity51 had been ' important work as the quartet 's representative			0
' @entity8 , a former @entity1 diplomat , said : ' i think he 's the wrong man and i also think it 's the wrong job ' but mr @entity8 was damning about mr @entity2 's role , and of the suggestion he could take on a ' wider role ' in the region			1
the job was , he said , a ' convenient excuse for doing nothing '			2
he told @entity63 's today programme : ' i think he 's not been able to do the job			2
i think he 's the wrong man and i also think it 's the wrong job			2
' ' he was appointed i think it was the day he ceased to be @entity1 prime minister and it struck me at the time as a very strange appointment in many ways			0
i 'm surprised he accepted it frankly			0
' asked if he was saying mr @entity2 should play no role in the region , he said : ' yes i am			1
i think it 's a mistake			0
he 's the wrong man			0
i find it hard to believe , frankly , that the @entity1 government would support him having a wider role			2
' i find it even harder to believe that the @entity22 , who are also members of the quartet , would support him having a wider role			2
' i 'm afraid if they do the reason is simply that he is a convenient excuse for doing nothing and that 's been the case over the eight years that we 've seen him in that			0
' the quartet has not achieved anything and @entity2 as its representative has achieved very , very little			1
' @entity91 mp @entity90 said mr @entity2 's decision was ' well overdue			1
' ' his effectiveness was ended almost as soon as he was appointed when he was n't allowed to do the politics , he was only allowed to do the economics of the @entity5 peace process			0
' frankly it was a waste of time , he never had the mandate from the quartet to achieve peace			0
' @entity102 , the former @entity104 mp and former member of the @entity106 said mr @entity2 's position was ' always a fig leaf '			1
he was disqualified from day one from fulfilling the role of peace envoy because of @entity111 – which runs like a vein through all conflicts in the @entity5			1
' mr @entity2 has been the envoy for the @entity27 , the @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 since shortly after he stepped down as prime minister in 2007 on sunday a @entity117 report said mr @entity2 was planning to ' step back ' from the job and in negotiations to ' recast ' his role while remaining involved in the peace process			1
he is thought to have met @entity122 , the @entity23 secretary of state , and @entity124 , the @entity21 's foreign policy chief , recently to discuss a possible job change			0
it follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between mr @entity2 's role in peace negotiations in the @entity5 and his business pursuits			1
sources told the ft that mr @entity2 has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable			1
there is also mounting unease in the @entity23 and @entity21 over his poor relations with senior @entity140 figures			0
mr @entity2 does not disclose his clients , but they have included countries such as @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			1
his corporate roster has featured @entity149 , an oil company with links to the @entity152 royal family , finance firm @entity151 and @entity154 , an @entity156 wealth fund			0
senior diplomats told the @entity117 mr @entity2 was being eased out			1
they said : ' it is long overdue			0
he has been ineffective in this job			0
he has no credibility in this part of the world			0
' a senior source in the @entity23 administration said : ' our position is clear			0
@entity2 has been a valued partner in trying to bring peace to the @entity5 and we will continue to value his input and support			2
' last year , a group of former @entity1 ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-prime minister to be removed from his role as @entity5 envoy , raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and attempts to ' absolve himself ' of responsibility for the @entity111 crisis			2
@entity183 's official spokesman said yesterday : ' i have seen the reports that mr @entity2 may be considering a revised role			1
' he has been doing an important role as the quartet representative since the second half of 2007			0
in terms of his own approach to how he thinks he may be best able to make a contribution , that is principally a matter for @entity2			2
' the prime minister thinks he has been doing important work as the quartet 's representative			0

@entity8 said mr @entity2 achieved ' very little ' as @entity201 envoy
the *ex-ambassador* to @entity9 said mr @entity2 had ' not been able to do the job '
critics said role in @entity15 made it impossible for him to be peace envoy
