@entity0 must address @entity2 ’s defensive lack of ‘ control ’ if they are to challenge rivals @entity4 and @entity5 for the @entity6 , admits @entity7			1
the former right back believes the departures of @entity10 and @entity11 have had a profound impact on the @entity13 , claiming they are without a calming influence at the back			1
@entity16 endured chronic problems last season , with @entity19 still struggling to hit on the sort of formula sir @entity21 cracked for years			0
@entity0 address a lack of defensive control , according to former defender @entity7 since the loss of @entity11 ( left ) and @entity10 ( right ) @entity2 have struggled for leadership and control and that is what sets @entity5 apart from @entity2 , argues @entity7			1
‘ what i always think you want in defenders is control and composure , ’ he told @entity30			2
‘ they know where they are meant to be and are not always diving around on their backside			0
@entity10 and @entity11 is [ @entity42 ] @entity41 and [ @entity7 ] @entity43			1
it ’s as good as it gets in football			0
‘ they are always in the right positions and they always clear the ball out of the box			0
i do n’t mean always as they ’ve all made mistakes but there ’s a composure and understanding there that in the big moments of a match they are not going to be flapping			0
instead they control and settle everybody around them			2
’ @entity7 himself is aware of what it takes to be a leader , having captained @entity2 in the past @entity7 celebrates passionately after @entity2 beat @entity4 during his playing days @entity68 has seen his league leaders concede just 15 goals , and @entity7 puts that down in no small part to their captain			1
‘ @entity74 does that at @entity5 you ’ve got to admit			1
he brings a level of real control to the defence			2
when i look at the @entity2 defence what it lacks is control			1
‘ i see players that have talent but they ’re all individually working , not having controlled movements together of in - sync			0
that comes through understanding and from playing together			0
’ @entity7 went on to praise calming influence of @entity90 , labelling him @entity2 's midfield ' piano '			1
the @entity13 have improved from the days of @entity16 since the arrival of @entity0 in the summer , and @entity90 has been an integral part of the team that has taken them to fourth in the @entity6			1
@entity7 cites @entity5 captain @entity74 ( pictured ) as an example of the calming presence @entity2 need @entity90 , in @entity2 's midfield , brings the influence that @entity7 thinks is so important in fact , @entity90 has played every minute of @entity6 football since november 8 , bar half an hour against @entity104 on @entity105			1
' when you play with @entity90 you think there is authority , control , peace , ' @entity7 said			1
' when you are on a football pitch playing against @entity112 or @entity4 , you need peace around you as well			0
' you sometimes do n’t want people running around like blue - arse flies			0
@entity116 and @entity90 together was peaceful			2
it was like going into a bar and hearing a piano playing			0
listening to some good rock is good and you like that too but sometimes it ’s nice to listen to a piano			0
' @entity90 has played almost every minute of @entity6 football since the start of november @entity90 ( centre ) , according to now @entity129 pundit @entity7 , is a ' piano ' in the @entity2 midfield @entity2 's start to @entity19 's reign was far from desirable , and guess who was n't present until november ? @entity90			1
@entity7 thinks that when it comes to the team - sheet , the 33 - year - old is one of the first names @entity19 jots down			1
' if you look at @entity0 at the start of the season and we were struggling , ask yourself who was n’t playing ? @entity90 was n’t playing			2
now he ’s playing and the club went on a great unbeaten run			0
i think he would be first or second on @entity0 ’s team - sheet because he brings control and authority			0
' @entity2 fans get it			2
i wanted @entity154 and someone to run through brick walls and coming out with bandages wrapped around his head			0
that ’s what @entity2 fans want			2

@entity7 thinks that @entity2 have struggled following the exits of @entity11 and @entity10
@entity7 believes they must address their lack of defensive control
@entity90 's calming influence has helped the midfield , he says
@entity7 cited @entity74 as an example of leadership @entity2 must follow
