a new @entity1 ’s drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients ’ brains could ‘ change the landscape ’ of future treatment , according to researchers			1
it has already performed so well at early - stage trials involving people living with the disease in the @entity13 that scientists are now in talks aimed at leapfrogging the usual second stage and fast - tracking it for larger trials			1
pharmaceutical firm @entity18 , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests by the end of the year			1
it is not yet known if this will include any from the @entity25			0
a new @entity1 ’s drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients ’ brains could ‘ change the landscape ’ of future treatment ( file picture ) there are currently half a million people in the @entity25 living with @entity1 ’s , and as yet there is no cure			1
‘ a lot of potential @entity1 ’s drugs never quite make it , ’ says @entity18 spokesman @entity37			2
‘ but the results we have seen in a relatively small patient sample are very hopeful			0
if this was replicated in a further trial , then it could change the landscape for treatment of @entity1 ’s			2
’ pharmaceutical firm @entity18 , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests ( picture posed by model ) the trial shows that aduncanumab significantly reduces amyloid plaque – clumps of protein typically found in the brains of @entity1 ’s patients			1
this plaque can lead to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue , causing devastating symptoms such as memory loss and personality changes			0
dr @entity69 , director of research at @entity71 , says the drug could prove an effective – and safe – treatment			0
he adds : ‘ these are very promising early results			0
it will be important to see results from much larger trials before we can understand how effective this treatment may be			1
’ the year - long early - stage trial saw 166 patients with mild or early symptoms of @entity1 ’s given either aduncanumab in varying doses , or a placebo			2
brain scans revealed that those patients on the strongest dose showed the most significant improvement in amyloid plaque by the end of the trial			2
patients were also given a number of ability tests and it was found that those on the highest dose had a ‘ significant slowing ’ of mental decline , while those taking the placebo declined the most			0
the findings were unveiled at the 12th international conference on @entity1 and @entity104 ’s diseases held in the @entity106 city of @entity107 last week .			0
