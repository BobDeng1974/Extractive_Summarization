@entity0 : dr @entity1 , a leading linguist from @entity2 , is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations the race is on to chronicle the @entity7 before it slips into extinction			1
a @entity2 linguist is now studying the dialects of the @entity11 - one of the last enclaves of @entity7 - to ensure it is recorded for posterity			1
native dialects of the language spoken by @entity0 are still used by around 3,000 people on the islands			2
on @entity20 they are estimated to number 20 , on @entity21 and on @entity22			0
the dialects on all three islands are distinct			0
the language - which is also used in parts of @entity27 - is now not spoken fluently by anyone under the age of 30 and is expected to disappear within a generation			2
dr @entity1 , a leading linguist from @entity2 , is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations			0
she told @entity34 : ' language often carries a symbolic force , as an emblem of groupness , a focus of ethnic allegiance and belonging , on a par with other symbols such as a flag or a national anthem			0
' this is not work that we can leave until a metaphorical tomorrow : unless considerable support is given to those people working to maintain and preserve the @entity7 of the @entity11 , it will disappear within the next few decades			1
' the @entity7 language has been spoken in the @entity11 for hundreds of years but began declining in medieval times with the stationing of garrisons of @entity55 soldiers in @entity21 and @entity56			1
@entity57 ( @entity58 ) @entity59 ( @entity59 ) @entity60 ( @entity20 @entity7 ) @entity61 ( @entity62 ) ( this dialect became extinct in around the 1950s ) the decline was exacerbated in the 19th century when trade with @entity66 increased dramatically with the arrival of steamships			1
this , combined with a growing number of tourists , led to @entity55 being seen as a means to prosperity and social advancement			0
a further blow to the language was the @entity78 occupation of the islands in @entity80 dr @entity81 said this led to the evacuation to the @entity84 of large numbers of women and children , the next generation of @entity7 speakers			1
' five years in the life of a child is a long time , so when they went back they had started to forget @entity7 , ' she said			1
@entity95 , @entity56 : experts say the island 's @entity7 dialect could die out within a generation in @entity56 the endangered @entity7 dialect , known as @entity101 , is now spoken by just 3.2 per cent of the population ( an estimated 2,000 people ) , and in @entity21 their version is spoken by just 2.2 per cent ( an estimated 1,000 people )			1
the @entity107 @entity106 states that 230 languages reached extinction in the past 60 years , and some 3,000 languages are currently endangered			0
the name @entity27 came because the @entity112 were known as ' north men ' and the language that evolved was known as @entity7 the origins of the language in the @entity11 come from the @entity117 after they finally conquered all of @entity119 ( modern - day @entity120 ) - as well as the @entity11 - under @entity122 in @entity123			1
the language spoken at that time was known as ' @entity126 ' ( ' of the people ' )			0
then , during the ninth and 10th century @entity112 began to sweep south from northern @entity129 for frequent marauding raids along the northern coast of @entity120			0
@entity135 up with the constant harassment , the king of the @entity133 gave them an area of land which is now modern - day @entity27 - and included the @entity11			1
the name @entity27 came because the @entity112 were known as ' north men ' and the language that evolved was known as @entity7			1
the language ' @entity7 ' then came to @entity84 shores with @entity0 when he set foot on @entity144 in september 1066			2
from then on it was the language of the aristocracy and other social classes seeking advancement , and is now known as ' @entity150 '			0
it retained its status until the early 15th century when it mysteriously dropped from use			0
dr @entity1 of @entity2 said no - one knows why this was but it could have been because most ordinary people carried on speaking @entity55 , whereas ' @entity150 ' was only spoken by the aristocracy and written down			0
there is one last @entity7 phrase still in use in @entity84 to this day			2
when a @entity162 has been passed by the @entity163 and the @entity164 it is given @entity165 - which means the @entity166 formally approves it - and the phrase ' @entity168 ' ( the @entity166 so wills it ) is used			0
