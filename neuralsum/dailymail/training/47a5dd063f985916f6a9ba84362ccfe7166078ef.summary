the operation was a success , but complications arose when staff inserted a tube into her lung incorrectly , causing it to collapse			0
after being told @entity4 ’s right lung had collapsed , her grandmother @entity58 , who has since died , asked paediatric cardiologist dr @entity60 what treatment she could be given			1
her husband @entity62 told the coroner that @entity64 had ‘ glared ’ at his wife and ‘ gave her a look of utter contempt ’ , before telling her @entity4 would have to wait until the following day			1

’ forty - eight hours later @entity4 died after both her lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest			1
at the inquest yesterday , her mother @entity1 said : ‘ i could not believe that @entity4 had just been left to deteriorate			2
‘ all along the family had expressed their concerns about @entity4 ’s breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done			1
i do not understand how things were left to get so bad			0
’ dr @entity64 , who has worked at @entity7 since 1993 , told the inquest he should have provided the treatment sooner			0
the doctor said @entity4 had been ‘ doing pretty fine ’ until she suffered an ‘ acute sudden collapse ’ on the morning of november 11 , when both lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest			1
@entity1 told an inquest her one - year - old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital ‘ i think we provided therapy by and large at the right time , ’ he said			1

but he added : ‘ i have doubts as to whether she would have survived long term			0
@entity15 with her grandparents , @entity131 and @entity58 , both helped keep a bedside vigil for the four weeks @entity4 spent in hospital before her death			2

nurses were too busy to regular check *patients* two *nights* before infant died
one - year - old @entity4 was ' overlooked and neglected '
doctors were ' *arrogant* and *unprofessional* '
parents were *repeatedly* told there was ' nothing to worry about '
hospital apologises for not requesting treatment on @entity4 soon enough
when family expressed concerns doctor treated them with ' utter contempt '
