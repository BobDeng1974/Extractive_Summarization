two @entity1 pranksters ask the question we have all wanted to know the answer to			0
can you really fool so - called experts into eating unhealthy food , believing it is the latest organic trend ? and it seems the answer is yes , with the due managing to convince foodies that @entity14 's food is actually a healthy alternative			1
these two girls were impressed with @entity18 and @entity19 's offering when asked to compare the duos food to @entity14 's , their response was hilarious founder and ceo of @entity24 , who aims to make movies that should go viral , @entity26 , told @entity27 : ' a lot of people in @entity30 are talking about organic and healthy food , so we wanted to see if people could really taste the difference between @entity14 's and organic healthy food , which they did n't			1
' when we saw the reactions in the edit we were laughing out loud , since it was so funny			0
' we wanted to create something that was worth spreading and worth talking about			0
we wondered if you could taste if food is organic , so we tried it with @entity14 's food since that was the least organic or natural food we could think off			1
' we did n't had much expectations of the reactions , but the responses were great , especially because we just asked them what they thought about it and if it tasted better than @entity14 's			1
' the ' experts ' told us it was way better and could ' really ' taste the organic element in it			0
' it might not look like class canapes but this was chopped chicken and fish from @entity14 's it might not look appealing , but food experts loved the @entity1 duo 's offerings the turnaround from @entity65 to organic convention standard was astounding the pranksters had some fun along the way as they got set to dupe the public @entity18 and @entity19 , who are two of the @entity71 , attend an organic food convention in @entity73 , @entity30 , where they were to present their delicacies			1
the problem is , that they do n't even own a restaurant or have a menu of organically sourced foods , so they decide to play the ultimate prank			0
the pair head to a nearby @entity84 's , and bag up a selection of items from the menu			0
then , using only cutlery and some cocktail sticks , they transform the food into smaller , bitesize portions , and decided to market it as their new organic food menu			2
this ' expert ' was definitely impressed with the fast food maybe this gentleman should have had a swill out before taking on @entity14 's food the taste - testing reactions of locals and experts at the convention at the @entity106 , @entity107 , are cringeworthy brilliant , as it is now time to ' some @entity14 's snacks to the biggest food experts of the @entity111			1
' one gentleman , after swallowing down some @entity112 says : ' tastes like fish , reminds me of cod , rolls around the tongue nicely , if it were wine i 'd say it 's fine			2
' to spice things up still further , the duo ask people what they see as the key difference between their ' organic ' treats and @entity84			0
this lady 's best bit was the fresh tomato - which the @entity1 boys had earlier suggested was ' out of date ' the organic convention drew a crowd of ' food experts as well as the general public the responses are laugh out loud			1
two girls , having tasted the @entity1 duo 's delicacies are posed the question : ' if you had to compare this , to say , @entity14 's food , what would you say is the biggest difference ? ' to which , the excruciating reply is : ' it definitely tastes a lot better , and the fact it is organic is definitely a good thing			1
' the taste is a lot richer			0
' putting some @entity1 flags onto the @entity14 's food - a sure - fire way to trick the public another girl , who judging by her attire is either part of a stall herself , or one of the ' experts ' says about the @entity84 : ' it 's definitely a lot tastier than @entity84 , you can just tell it is a lot more pure			1
' another lady adds : ' this absolutely has a lot more taste to it than @entity14 's			2
' at the end of the video , @entity18 asks cedrique what they have learnt from their expedition			0
@entity19 responds : ' that if you tell people that something is organic , they 'll automatically believe it 's organic			2
' quite so , @entity19 , quite so .			0

@entity18 and @entity19 , from ' @entity181 off ' delicacies ' at convention
food experts and the public well and truly hooked in
one man says if the *fillet* - o - fish was a wine , it would be ' fine '
