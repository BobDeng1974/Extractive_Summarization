by @entity0 published : 09:37 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 11:23 est , 7 october 2013 death : @entity2 died from a blood clot last year , but was misdiagnosed with a calf sprain a woman suffering from deep vein thrombosis was told to take ibuprofen and ‘ wear comfortable shoes ’ when a doctor misdiagnosed her condition as a sprain , an inquest heard today			1
a coroner condemned dr @entity14 for neglect after he failed to ask about her family history or refer her to @entity17			1
@entity2 , 47 - who died ten days later - had gone to the @entity18 in south - east @entity19 fearing a sore right calf might have indicated dvt			1
a receptionist referred the mother - who had been ‘ limping around ’ and had a family history of @entity21 - to the adjoining @entity25 , which deals with minor conditions , to see a gp			1
a second receptionist then warned ms @entity2 she faced a two - hour wait , so could either ‘ go away or wait to see a doctor ’			1
she decided to wait and eventually saw a doctor			2
dr @entity14 , who examined her , ruled out @entity21 in favour of a sprain he said she probably suffered while packing up her christmas tree days earlier , @entity32 heard			1
he sent her home and told her to rest , take ibuprofen , apply ice and wear comfortable shoes			2
she died ten days later , with a post-mortem examination indicating a blood clot in her calf had travelled to her lung			2
coroner dr @entity46 said dr @entity14 should be referred to the @entity47 to see if there was any training he could be given to prevent a similar event happening again			1
referral : ms @entity2 went to the @entity18 ( pictured ) in south - east @entity19 fearing a sore right calf might have indicated @entity21 medical expert dr @entity53 told the court in @entity19 that the misdiagnosis could have been representative of a system - wide failure of the time pressures facing gps			1
‘ i do feel that general practitioners are working under very serious time pressures , ’ he said			2
‘ my concern is ... the time pressures may lead to inadequate consultations			2
’ he said dr @entity14 committed ‘ very serious failures ’ by not considering ms @entity2 ’s family history or conducting proper tests			1
he recommended dr @entity14 be referred to the @entity47			1
but dr @entity14 denied he was rushed and insisted he had determined the pain was the result of a sprain because he could see no swelling or other symptoms of @entity21			1
however , he conceded he should have asked more about ms @entity2 ’s family history and his threshold for referring patients for further tests had lowered since the incident			1
dr @entity14 told the court he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because ‘ i do n’t want to be here again ’			1
he said : ‘ it is only the registration details we see , so we go ahead and take a medical history			0
ms @entity2 had been in pain for four days - it was not a recent trauma with no swelling in leg			1
‘ she had pain but i do n’t remember her limping			0
i ca n’t remember if i asked her about her family history			0
i did n’t assess whether any of the risk factors for @entity21 applied			1
‘ i asked why she was here and she said she had pain in her right calf			2
i asked her to expose it and she said she was worried about @entity21			1
‘ i asked if there was anything she could think of that would give this pain and she said she had been in the loft lifting decorations and i said maybe she had just sprained her calf			2
‘ i told her to take ibuprofen and wear comfortable shoes and gave her some exercises			0
‘ it does matter if a diagnosis of a clot is missed because it could breakaway and go to the lungs or brain , and there are treatments to prevent that			0
’ inquest : dr @entity14 told @entity32 ( file picture ) in @entity19 he would conduct more thorough tests in the future because ' i do n't want to be here again ' ms @entity2 ’s daughter @entity125 said dr @entity126 knew the family ’s history of @entity21 because she made a point of mentioning it in his office			1
she told the inquest : ‘ we were seen by a doctor at about 5.35am and i went in with her because she had trouble walking and was leaning on me for support			0
‘ @entity137 rolled up her trouser leg and explained she felt her leg was swollen and had trouble walking			0
‘ the doctor asked her to roll up her other trouser leg and said we can rule out a dvt , as the leg would have to be severely swollen to indicate that			0
‘ we both said we were relieved it was n’t @entity21 because it runs in our family , and the doctor said it was simply a sprain			1
’ she said she then told the doctor : “ oh , that is really good it ’s not a dvt - we thought it was because it runs in the family ”			2
she added : ‘ my nan suffered with dvt and my aunt has had blood clots			0
he asked if there was anything mum could have done and i said about her getting decorations out of the loft on a ladder			0
' we both said we were relieved it was n’t @entity21 because it runs in our family , and the doctor said it was simply a sprain ' @entity125 , daughter ‘ the doctor gave her seven to ten days recovery period , gave her ibuprofen , told her about some exercises she could do and advised her to use an ice pack			1
he looked at her legs for a matter of seconds			0
’ recording a narrative verdict , the coroner said : ‘ i find it improbable to believe that the family would n't have mentioned their history to the doctor so conclude the referral to @entity21 was made			2
‘ dr @entity53 said he should have referred to the history			2
the consequences of missing this are in this case catastrophic			0
i record a narrative verdict			0
with respect to the history taken and non-referral to @entity17 , i find dr @entity14 in neglect			1
‘ he was not the most credible witness and appeared confused			0
i am going to refer this to the @entity47			0
there are uncertainties about what has happened and why it happened			0
' after the verdict , sisters @entity125 and @entity200 said in a statement : ‘ we are very pleased with the coroner 's verdict			0
he was very thorough and he gave us a conclusion that confirmed everything that we thought and were suspicious of			0
‘ in a sense this is closure because we feel justified because sometimes things happen and someone is looking at it the same way as us and agrees with that			0
‘ i just want dr @entity14 to look at the things he did and do it differently			1
we do n't need him to be punished but retrained again			0
we never want to see another family go through that			0
we 're just glad we got the verdict and will see what happens next			0
’ the two girls also paid tribute to their ‘ sincere ’ mum , who used to be an accounts manager : ‘ she was funny , loveable and trustworthy - one of the most sincere and nicest people you could meet			2
