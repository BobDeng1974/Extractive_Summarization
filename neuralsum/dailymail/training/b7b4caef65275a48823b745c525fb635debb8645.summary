by @entity0 published : 04:45 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 09:35 est , 20 august 2013 small , discreet and completely innocent looking , this tiny ' key fob phone ' has been widely advertised as a ' fun item '			1
but they are deadly serious to the prisoners inside @entity6 jails , who have been smuggling them in to make illegal calls			0
the tiny handsets , which sell for £ 40 on various auction sites , can be easily hidden from guards , and offer inmates the chance to make calls or texts			1
various sellers boast that the phones , which often have logos on , are made with minimal metal and are largely constructed of plastic			0
this will be useful to buyers who want to use them in prison as they will evade the metal detectors used in prisons to hunt out contraband items			2
having a mobile phone in jail is a criminal offence carrying a two - year sentence and / or an unlimited fine			1
currently there are approximately 41,000 confiscated mobile phones in storage , costing the @entity49 £ 20,000 per annum , according to official figures			1
prisoners are risking a two - year sentence and / or an unlimited fine to smuggle in the small phones at present , inmates are given enough money to buy stamps and make phone calls to keep in touch with their family			1
currently , prisons can not destroy mobile phones that are confiscated , but a new @entity64 hopes to change that			1
in february , a @entity64 giving prisons new powers to destroy or dispose of unauthorised property found in the possession of prisoners received @entity70			0
the @entity71 , backed by the @entity72 , will allow governors to destroy , recycle , sell or donate illicit mobile phones and other unauthorised items			2
any proceeds will go to charities or other suitable organisations			0
prisons minister @entity79 said : ' we are determined to address the problems caused by mobile phones and contraband in prisons - it is totally unacceptable that prisons have had to pay for storing these items after confiscation			1
' this @entity64 will give new powers to prison authorities so that they can dispose of mobile phones and unauthorised property in an appropriate and cost - effective way			2
' the new powers will apply to items found in the possession of a prisoner or an escort vehicle			0
the @entity98 has been brought forward by @entity99 in the @entity100 and @entity101 in the @entity102			0
a @entity49 spokesperson said : ' the government is clamping down on mobile phones in prison and our rigorous security measures mean even the smallest mobiles can be detected and kept out of prison			0
' a range of techniques - including @entity113 and high sensitivity metal detectors - has seen the number of recorded seizures increase			0
' we 're now working closely with the @entity117 and trading standards to remove these small mobiles from sale in the @entity6 , as well as legislating to block phone signals in prisons			2
