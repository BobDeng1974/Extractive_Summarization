making waves : @entity1 is due to compete in his first race since the @entity19 ' i think he 's just going to test the waters a little bit and see how it goes , ' @entity12 said by phone from @entity25			1

' @entity14 returned to training last fall and re-entered the @entity29 drug - testing program			1
he has completed his six - month waiting period by the @entity32 to be eligible for competition			2
@entity12 said @entity14 is ' pretty far ' from being back in top form			2
he 's been training monday through friday with @entity12 's team at the @entity36			0
' he 's gotten back into good shape since september , ' the coach said			2
' he can give a good effort and certainly not be embarrassed			0
he 's in enough shape to swim competitively			0

then , if he qualifies , he 'll decide which race to swim for the evening finals , @entity12 said			0
he 'll swim the 50 free on the second day and might swim the 50 fly ' just for fun , ' the coach added			0
timing : former teammate @entity42 ( seen competing against one another in 2012 ) will also be getting back in the pool at the @entity10 meet , suggesting that they are both ramping up to compete in 2016 @entity14 will stick to the shorter races and some relays rather than the grueling individual medleys he swam during the height of his career			1
' he 's really doing this because he wants to â € ” there 's no outside pressure at all , ' @entity12 said			0
@entity14 has already entered the remaining @entity45 meets in @entity90 , @entity91 in may and @entity92 , @entity93 in june , although @entity12 said no decision has been made on whether he will compete			2
