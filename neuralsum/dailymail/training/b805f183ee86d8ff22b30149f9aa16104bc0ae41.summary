by @entity0 a family of four fell ‘ horrifically ’ ill during a @entity3 summer holiday which left two young daughters in hospital , one in critical condition			1
the @entity1 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , travelled to the 3 * @entity9 , @entity10 in @entity11 in june , but say the trip turned into every family ’s ‘ worst nightmare ’ when all of them fell ill and two - year - old daughters @entity17 and @entity18 were hospitalised for days as they battled @entity20			1
@entity21 , @entity22 , who was made redundant on his return to work , was also diagnosed with having contracted the bacteria			1
nightmare : a holiday to @entity11 turned into disaster for the @entity1 when they contracted @entity30 critical : @entity18 spent 21 days in @entity32 in @entity33 and needed dialysis the toddlers have now been diagnosed with haemolytic uraemia syndrome – a condition related to @entity30 which can cause kidney failure due to a breakdown of red blood cells – and distraught parents @entity22 and @entity42 have instructed expert international illness lawyers at @entity44 to investigate what caused them to fall ill and to help secure their daughters funds for on - going treatment			1
worry : @entity42 checks in on her daughter @entity18 in hospital , pictured holding @entity17 who also fell ill on the @entity11 holiday to make matters worse , @entity22 was made redundant on his return from his job as a production worker in manufacturing , as he took time off to care for his daughters , which affected his redundancy score negatively			1
the family arrived at the 3 * @entity62 resort , in the @entity64 area of @entity11 on june 1 for an 11 day break , but within days all of them began suffering from symptoms of sickness , diarrhoea and stomach cramps			2
@entity22 , @entity17 and @entity18 were all diagnosed as suffering with @entity20 on their return and the girls symptoms were so severe that they were admitted to the @entity32 in @entity33			1
@entity17 , who was two in july , was discharged after six days but @entity18 , who turns three at the end of the month , spent 21 days in hospital and needed dialysis to help her kidneys function properly			1
@entity22 , 38 , said : ' the last few weeks have been like our worst nightmare coming to life as we have had to watch our little girls fight for their lives in hospital			2
' the last thing we imagined was that we would all fall so horrifically ill. we did notice that some of the food that should have been chilled was left at room temperature and some of it was undercooked , but we tried to be as careful as possible			2
' the worst thing now is not knowing whether the girls have been left with permanent kidney problems as a result			0
we just can not believe how going on holiday has turned all of our lives upside down			0
' i lost my job and @entity42 is a housewife so on top of our worries about the girls , we are also concerned about what the future will hold for us financially			2
it is a combination of anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells , kidney failure and a low platelet count			0
acquired from contaminated food or water , the disease predominately affects children			0
has a 5 % -10 % mortality rate , with most recovering without major consequences			0
however in the most serious of cases , dialysis and life - long renal replacement therapy may be needed to treat kidney disease			1
' we just want answers about what caused the illness and to know that if hygiene failings are found , steps are taken to rectify them and prevent anyone else suffering in the same horrible way as we have			0
' @entity127 , a specialist international personal injury lawyer at @entity44 who has now contacted @entity130 to notify the tour operator that legal action is being considered said : ' @entity133 suffered a horrible ordeal on their holiday which became so serious for @entity17 and @entity18 that they were admitted to hospital on their return to the @entity140 because of the severity of their condition			1
' the family will not know whether there has been any significant lasting damage caused until next year which will understandably be an agonising wait for them all			2
' @entity20 is a bacteria which can be contracted by eating contaminated food such as raw unwashed vegetables and undercooked meat , but following good food hygiene standards can prevent it from spreading			0
' we are now investigating whether more could have been done to prevent the family from falling so ill and hope that @entity130 will work with us quickly and amicably so we can complete out investigations for the family			0
' rooms at the @entity62 resort , per person all inclusive , range from £ 33 - £ 78 a night			0
the hotel also offers bed and breakfast and half - board options .			0
