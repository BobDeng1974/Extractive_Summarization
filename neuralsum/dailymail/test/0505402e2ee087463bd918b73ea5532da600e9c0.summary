the future of @entity2 ’s coaching arrangement with @entity3 looks shrouded in doubt after he confirmed that they will take a prolonged break from each other after @entity8			1
@entity3 , who is expecting a baby in august , will be replaced by @entity10 in the lead - up to the @entity12 and quite possibly after that , depending on how she assesses her priorities			1
the 27 - year - old @entity16 , who is in @entity17 for this week ’s @entity18 and joined in the 100 - year celebrations at the @entity20 on monday night , parted company with @entity22 last year because the @entity23 was no longer able to spend half the year travelling			1
@entity2 ( centre ) , @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 help to blow out the candles on a cake to celebrate 100 years at the @entity20 in @entity17 , the venue for this week 's @entity18 @entity2 ( left ) and coach @entity10 enjoy the celebrations in @entity17 on monday evening @entity2 ( left ) arrives at the party alongside @entity34 sports manager @entity33 @entity2 ( right ) poses for a picture alongside @entity37 champion @entity36 @entity2 made it clear that if the responsibilities of parenthood prevent @entity3 from fulfilling her 26 - week commitment , then their relationship may have to go the same way			1
‘ right now @entity3 does all the major competitions but if she does n’t want to do loads of time , i do n’t find it beneficial if someone just comes in for the major competitions and does n’t do any of the training , any of the other events , ’ @entity2 said			2
the plan is for @entity3 to work with him up until @entity8 , although by then she will be in the latter stages of pregnancy			2
@entity2 originally considered @entity10 as a replacement for @entity22 so if their current trial works well , it is likely he will take a more significant role than as an assistant to @entity3			1
it quickly became clear to @entity2 that the respected @entity10 might be used in an increased capacity after @entity3 told him in february that , eight months after they had formalised their agreement , she was expecting — initially saying she had ‘ something personal ’ to tell him			1
‘ i thought , “ something personal to tell you ? ” i thought maybe she ’s pregnant , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ she normally goes to the gym all the time but she did n’t train once through @entity71			0
when she told me , it was a bit of a surprise			0
but because she ’d pre-warned me i kind of expected it a little bit			0
’ @entity2 and @entity3 look likely to part ways when his coach gives birth later on in the year @entity79 ( left ) will work with @entity2 until the end of the @entity12 and then maybe longer @entity3 is not in @entity17 this week for @entity2 ’s first tournament on the clay since he got married			1
so far everything with @entity10 has been satisfactory and he joined them in @entity85 last week at a training camp			2
‘ he ’s easy going but as a player he was mentally very strong and had a great work ethic , ’ @entity2 said			0
‘ i see him as being a good fit personality-wise but you do n’t really get the whole package until you ’re playing matches and there ’s a bit more pressure and stress			0
i would n’t imagine it would be too much of a problem for him			0
’ although wearing a wedding ring , @entity2 will be taking it off when he plays			0
‘ i ca n’t play with it holding the racket because it gives me blisters , ’ he said			0
after @entity17 , @entity2 is playing masters level events in @entity107 and @entity108 before heading to the @entity109 in @entity110			2
@entity2 trains ahead of the @entity18 in @entity17 where he looks to pick up some wins on clay			1

@entity10 joined @entity2 's camp on an initial trial
@entity3 is *due* to give birth to her first child in august
@entity10 will work with @entity2 right through to the @entity12
@entity2 is in @entity17 to compete in this week 's @entity18 on clay
