a warning over the growing use of cctv and its sinister potential was issued yesterday by @entity5 ’s surveillance tsar			0
independent commissioner @entity6 said he was troubled by the public ’s lack of concern about how much they were being watched and monitored			1
he also warned that the proliferation of spy cameras and their increasing sophistication raised issues of privacy and ‘ what sort of society we want to live in ’			1
police , housing and environmental health officers , landlords , door supervisors , university security staff and even supermarket workers are now wearing state - of - the - art cameras to capture anti-social behaviour on film			2
in his first full interview in his role as surveillance commissioner , mr @entity6 said : ‘ the lack of public awareness about the nature of surveillance troubles me			1
‘ when people say “ the public love cctv ” , do they really know what it does and its capability ? do they know with advancing technology , and algorithms , it starts to predict behaviour ? ' if people are going round with surveillance equipment attached to them , there should be a genuinely good and compelling reason for that			0
‘ it changes the nature of society and raises moral and ethical issues about what sort of society we want to live in			1
’ mr @entity6 urged public bodies , including the police , to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people fears of yobbish behaviour at an @entity79 supermarket in @entity80 led to security staff being issued with body worn cameras			1
meanwhile , guards at universities , including @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , have started wearing body cameras and microphones in a bid to reduce crime and fights on campuses			2
mr @entity6 , a former senior counter-terrorism officer at the @entity96 , told the @entity97 : ‘ there ’s a security argument , but there ’s also a personal freedom argument			2
have universities been transparent with students and parents ? ’ he was appointed in march and is responsible for overseeing around 100,000 publicly - operated cctv cameras out of total of up to 6million surveillance cameras nationwide			2
public authorities and commercial cctv systems have to comply with a code of practice setting out transparency requirements and a number of measures about how recordings can be stored and used			0
but the code does not apply to householders who have installed cctv on properties to deter burglars and other crime – leading to a 200 per cent surge in complaints about spying neighbours			0
mr @entity6 urged public bodies , including the police , to be more transparent about how they are increasingly using smart cameras to monitor people			1
he warned that spiralling levels of surveillance technology , especially lightweight cameras worn on uniforms , could harm community policing by making the public reluctant to talk if they were confronted with ‘ a million pixels up their nostrils ’			1
he said : ‘ it is wrong not to be transparent because it impacts … on the whole psyche of the community			0
it is very dangerous to walk into a datafied society , where everybody is a number and everybody can be linked via @entity28 to facial recognition , to another thing			0
’ discussing drones , mr @entity6 said : ‘ every time a drone is operating with a surveillance camera attached to it , then the risk of a privacy impact in a public space rises exponentially			1
’ he also urged who received the hi - tech machines to use them responsibly			0
he said : ‘ you might say “ it ’s just a toy ” but used repeatedly , hovering over a neighbour ’s house , is going to cause an issue			0
you should use it with a great deal of sensitivity			0
