by @entity0 published : 11:21 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 15:54 est , 27 september 2013 quiet day at the office : radio 1 djs including @entity3 , pictured , today , were banned from speaking listeners of @entity5 witnessed something of a first today when they tuned into the @entity8 's popular music station to hear ... music			1
presenters @entity12 , @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14 are being forced to keep schtum for 12 hours - with @entity15 as the only outlet for their usual chatter			1
continuous music has played from 7am until 7pm - and judging by the reactions on @entity15 , listeners were pleased to have some respite from the vocal inputs of the station 's djs			1
the station , which is keen to attract a somewhat younger audience than the 30 - year - old crowd who used to tune into @entity29 , announced the stunt as the end to their even more music month of september - which saw ' some of the biggest names in music ' perform in the station 's live lounge including @entity37 and @entity38			2
the only verbal interruptions came in the form of from news updates from the radio 1 newsbeat team , @entity43 and @entity44			0
those who were desperate to get some of the usual banter during today 's spell of quiet were invited to turn to the station 's official @entity15 feed , @ @entity51 , where the four djs were granted a chance to let off steam			2
from the start , listeners expressed their relief at the calm , with @entity59 tweeting at the time of @entity12 's usual breakfast show : ' been listening for almost 2 hours now and not heard @entity12 's voice once			2
several @entity15 users said that it was good to hear the station doing what it was designed for			1
noises off : at 7am , @entity5 announces that silence will reign ... and @entity15 will become the platform for the presenters ' prattle relief : @entity12 's breakfast show was the first moment listeners heard - and relished - the sound of music uninterrupted sound of silence : listeners said that it was a change to hear a music station playing actual music miffed : some @entity15 users confessed that they missed the casual banter of the @entity5 presenters as music rang out over the airwaves bemused : the stunt passed some listeners by for several hours before they realised the presenters were nowhere to be heard @entity89 tweeted : ' it 's so good listening to the radio when there 's no talking			1
there were , however , one or two who apparently missed the friendly chit - chat of @entity97			0
twitter user @entity98 wrote : ' do n't like that # @entity99 are n't letting the djs talk today			0
that 's what i listen for '			0
and @entity104 was one who confessed that he had n't even noticed the difference , tweeting - at around 3.30pm - ' listening to # radio1 since 7.50am , only just noticed no one is talking			0
in a world of my own '			0
meanwhile , the presenters themselves appeared to have adopted coping strategies to deal with this day - long challenge			0
phew ! challenge complete , @entity3 , left , leaves the @entity5 studio after the challenge , which kicked off with @entity12 , pictured right , this morning @entity115 : the presenter finds it tough to get used to the alternative to usual listener phone - ins a picture is worth ... @entity3 creates doodles to describe the songs that are coming up			1
any guesses ? @entity3 seemed to get a bit angsty without any verbal feedback , and began demanding more interaction from @entity5 listeners			2
in the end she took to inflicting ' doodles ' on the @entity15 feed to help listeners ' guess ' which songs were coming up			0
@entity13 apparently found the challenge almost impossible , tweeting after less than an hour : ' @entity135 ! ! ! ! ' and the @entity100 eventually made do with ' writing along ' to the lyrics of songs such as @entity139 's we belong together			1
@entity140 : @entity14 , left , and @entity13 , right , were forced to keep silent throughout their shows too tough : @entity13 almost caves in on his airwaves silence , relying on @entity15 to release the tension write - along : the presenters do their best to join in , but it just is n't quite the same on @entity15 ... of course , there was still time for those endearing antics for which the radio 1 team are so beloved			1
@entity13 's sidekick @entity150 at one stage took over the @entity15 feed while @entity153 had gone for a break and changed his profile picture			1
@entity14 - who took over from 4pm - joked that he had spent the previous day scheduling tweets so he could bunk off in @entity157			0
by 7pm , all will be back to normal , and the presenters will return to their usual slots on monday morning .			0

@entity15 users express relief for @entity5 's 12 - hour @entity100 silence
*non-stop* music and news play as presenters allowed to comment on @entity15
@entity12 , @entity3 , @entity13 and @entity14 took part
