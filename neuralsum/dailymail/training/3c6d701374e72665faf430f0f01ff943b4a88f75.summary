by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:11 est , 10 march 2014 updated : 19:11 est , 10 march 2014 @entity3 should celebrate the next increase in interest rates , according to @entity7 deputy governor @entity6 @entity3 should celebrate the next increase in interest rates , according to @entity7 deputy governor @entity6			2
he said that such a move would signal that the economy is heading towards recovery			0
however he admitted the prospect was very low for the next few years and , when it does happen , the @entity7 would keep the base rate ‘ materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while ’ , probably rising only to around two to three per cent			1
it has been five years since the central bank halved the base rate to 0.5 per cent , the lowest level in its 320 - year history in a huge boost for homeowners with a mortgage			1
speaking in @entity25 yesterday , mr @entity6 said : ‘ when the time does come for us to start raising bank rate , we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality			2
’ his comments echo similar ones made by the chancellor recently who said the first increase in interest rates should be heralded as ‘ a mark of success ’			0
but homeowners , who are struggling to afford their mortgage even at today ’s rock - bottom rates of interest , may struggle to agree that a rate rise will provide a reason to celebrate			1
there are particular worries about around one million first - time buyers who have bought over the last five years and have never experienced an increase rate rise			2
a recent report , based on research by the @entity52 and @entity53 , predicts the base rate will rise three times to 1.25 per cent by december 2015			1
for a family with the average monthly mortgage bill of £ 666 , this would trigger a £ 21 a month rise to £ 687 a month , equal to an extra £ 252 a year increase in their mortgage			0
mr @entity6 said the first increase could take place in the spring , but urged people not to get ‘ too hung up about the precise date ’			0
in the @entity68 s latest inflation report , it said the market expects the bank to keep the base rate ' in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon ' more importantly , he said the increases will be done ‘ only gradually ’ and that there is absolutely no chance of rates returning to their pre-crisis average of five per cent imminently			1
mr @entity6 , 60 , who retires in june , said : ‘ what , i think , is more useful for businesses to hang on to is our expectation that when bank rate does rise , it will probably do so only gradually			2
‘ [ it will rise ] to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while			0
‘ i have something like a two to three per cent range in mind here			0
’ it is widely expected that the base rate will remain around this level of two to three per cent until 2020			1
by comparison , it was typically five per cent during the ten years leading up to the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007			0
in the @entity7 ’s latest inflation report , it said the market expects the bank to keep the base rate ‘ in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon			1
’ the so - called forecast horizon ends in 2017 , and ‘ for some while beyond ’ is taken to mean another two to three years after this date .			0

it has been five years since central bank halved base rate to 0.5 per cent
lowest level in 320 - years and huge boost for homeowners with mortgage
@entity6 says when interest rate is raised it should be ' celebrated '
