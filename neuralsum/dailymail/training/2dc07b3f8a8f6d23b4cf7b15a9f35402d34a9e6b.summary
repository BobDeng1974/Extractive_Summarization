by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ a @entity3 designer has captured the defining moments of the current and previous @entity5 to produce eye - catching prints of the tournament ’s most remarkable goals			2
from the wonder of @entity12 ’s goal for @entity13 in their extraordinary 5 - 1 victory over @entity16 to the controversy of @entity19 ’s bite on @entity20 , @entity21 born @entity9 brings @entity22 to @entity3 in an understated but hugely inventive manner			1
the drawings detail the stadium , the date , the fixture and offer a step - by - step portrayal of how the goals came about , as shown by @entity31 ’ depiction of @entity33 ’s sensational volley in @entity35 ’s group stage match against @entity13			0
key moments : @entity38 's goal against @entity39 has been made into a print , as has the controversial moment that saw @entity19 bite @entity42 's @entity20 it clearly demonstrates the moment that @entity33 met an angled ball from the right - hand side with a stunning left - footed volley that crashed in off the underside of the crossbar			1
it is one of nine prints currently on sale charting @entity31 ’ most memorable moments from this @entity54 but this is just one of several collections that he has produced , including all - time great @entity54 goals such as @entity60 ’s individual goal against @entity61 and sir @entity63 ’s @entity54 final goal for @entity61 against @entity64 in 1966			1
pick of the best : @entity12 's header against @entity16 and @entity33 's volley against @entity13 make the cut @entity9 , a @entity68 supporter , has also created prints inspired by the @entity70 , with his involvement in these designs spurred on by @entity74 ’s last - gasp title winning strike against @entity76 in 2012			1
@entity9 said : ‘ the idea to document football moments was just natural and i wanted each print to have consistency , but also have its own unique trait			2
i just think it ’s fascinating that you can re-create it in such a simplistic way and it still re-ignites the emotion from that day			0
’ classic strikes : @entity60 's goal against @entity61 in 1986 is turned into a print as is @entity63 's hat - trick goal against @entity64 in 1966 ‘ the @entity54 is now in full flow and presents an irresistible opportunity to relive some old moments and capture new stand out moments as they happen			1
‘ it ’s been a fantastic @entity54 so far despite @entity61 ’s poor showing			0
it ’s proving hard to pick a winner with many of the highly rated teams such as @entity22 , @entity13 , @entity64 and @entity102 all struggling to convince - it could go anyway			0
but with the @entity68 connection , it has to be @entity102			0
’ leaving it late : @entity105 struck for @entity42 in extra-time in 2006 , as did @entity107 for @entity16 in 2010 the prints are available from @entity110 ’ @entity108 / or on etsy https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/rincks .			0
