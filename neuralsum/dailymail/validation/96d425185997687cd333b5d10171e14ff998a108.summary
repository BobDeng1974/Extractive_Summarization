@entity0 insists @entity1 can mount a late charge to win the @entity4 title , however statistics from the last 10 years show @entity6 tend to finish the season off in fine form			1
@entity4 leaders @entity6 have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years			2
if the @entity13 replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then @entity12 will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins			2
@entity6 look set to win the 2014 - 15 @entity4 title as the @entity13 tend to finish the season off in fine form @entity6 dropped two points against @entity21 at the weekend but are still odds - on favourites to win the title @entity0 insists @entity1 have joined @entity6 and @entity12 in the @entity4 title race 2013 - 14 : 11 points dropped 12 - 13 : 7 11 - 12 : 15 10 - 11 : 10 09 - 10 : 5 08 - 09 : 6 07 - 08 : 10 06 - 07 : 11 05 - 06 : 6 average : 8.6 points dropped @entity6 are seven points clear of @entity12 with a game in hand of both their title rivals @entity1 are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind @entity4 leaders @entity6 , having played a game less than the @entity36			1
however @entity0 said after his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity21 : ‘ of course @entity1 are in it			2
they are seven points behind @entity6 , but have one less match to play than @entity6			0
‘ both @entity12 and @entity1 are in the title race			2
it depends on the momentum for @entity1 - the 3 - 1 defeat against @entity45 or the 3 - 0 defeat against @entity47 ? ‘ so the danger is always there			0
but i keep saying , we are there			0
if someone had told me in august that , at the end of march , we 'd be six points in front with a match in hand , i 'd have signed for that immediately			0
' @entity6 would finish the season off with over 85 points ( 85.4 to be exact ) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season			1
the maximum amount of points @entity12 can ascertain is 85 and that would mean @entity71 's side defeating the likes of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity21			1
@entity1 , on the other hand , will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign			0
so it appears @entity0 's statement on @entity1 's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against @entity21			1
