the @entity8 club on @entity9 refused membership to the reality star after she attempted to join ' numerous times ' , according to it former membership director			1
in an article by @entity16 , current and past staff and member open up about the elite club 's intriguing membership policy , which values ' creativity ' over net worth or job titles			1
not tonight , love : @entity2 unsuccessfully tried to get @entity8 membership numerous times , accrding to @entity29 's former admissions boss @entity30 2015 visit site if there 's one thing @entity2 loves , it 's a cleavage baring outfit			1
for the @entity37 she donned a metallic @entity40 number straight from his catwalk show in @entity42			2
with its plunging neckline and mile - high slit , this look left little to the imagination			2
we 're crazy for the belted waist and embellished shoulders , sleeves , and pockets			2
with her strappy sandals and sexy tousled hair , the reality star looks like a golden goddess			2
metallics are consistently a go - to item when it comes to red carpet dressing			2
@entity60 and @entity61 both dressed in shiny renditions for the award ceremony too			0
it 's a look with which you just ca n't go wrong ! we 've put together a selection of resplendent items below from @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 to recreate @entity2 's look in a major way			1
our favorite is the @entity76 number by far ! @entity77 at @entity78 visit site @entity70 by @entity80 at @entity81 visit site @entity84 ' @entity83 at @entity85 visit site @entity87 at @entity78 visit site ' we denied access to every @entity91 who applied , ' said @entity92 , the @entity29 branch 's former director of membership			1
' @entity2 has unsuccessfully tried numerous times			1
' ' @entity95 showed up and chose not to join			1
we did n't let him up , ' he added			0
' there was a debate over @entity99			1
not sure how that played out			0
' the super-exclusive clique on 9200 @entity9 , now celebrating its fifth birthday , is the third such outpost , following its sister spots in @entity105 and @entity106			1
creatives only : every ' @entity108 ' who applied for membership was rejected , including the local ones from @entity112 ' we imposed a value system on a community that celebrates financial success over morality , ' @entity92 claimed			1
' someone would put forward a name and note that their movie just made $ 200 million			0
' but someone may have known they were cheating on their boyfriend with a woman and were widely known to be an a * * hole			0
that happened more than you would know			0
it was discussed in committee meetings			0
there was a great sense of doing the right thing			0
@entity92 said the worse the rejects were , the harder they took it - which gave some at @entity8 immense satisfaction			0
elite : the exclusive penthouse club on 9200 @entity9 offers stunning panoramic views of @entity142 if your name 's not down ... : membership of the club is based on creativity , rather than net worth or job title the yeses : @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 have all been seen at the elite club ' the very worst people , it mattered tremendously to them , which doubled our satisfaction in rejecting them , he said			1
' people denied would say there must be a mistake			0
" when do i get my membership card ? " there was no recourse			2
' the former director said he once imagined a scheme where he would tell members they could vote to reject someone if they paid for the would - be applicant 's annual fee , adding that ' certain people ' would have had their membership paid for 20 times over had the rule been implemented			2
he added that ' anyone who crows about their success or trades on it is quickly brought down ' , and that ' people who undersold themselves were likelier to be admitted '			0
nos and maybes : according to the article @entity95 was refused entry while there was a ' debate ' on whether or not to let @entity99 in in @entity16 article , showrunners , writers and directors , as well as actors such as @entity151 and @entity195 's @entity194 , praise the club 's privacy , its intimate setting , its cosy design and its stunning 360 degree view of @entity142			1
one thing @entity203 might have enjoyed at the club was a fun recent installation - called @entity206 - consisting of a door with strobe lighting , music and laughter coming from behind it , while a girl with a clipboard and a velvet rope stood in front and told anyone who approached : ' i 'm sorry , you 're not on the list '			0
@entity220 , @entity153 , @entity221 , @entity152 and @entity222 have all been photographed there , while the article reminisces about parties thrown for @entity226 and @entity227			0
