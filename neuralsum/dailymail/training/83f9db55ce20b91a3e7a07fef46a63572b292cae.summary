president @entity0 said wednesday that he would ' work with @entity1 to ramp up support for those in the @entity5 opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator			1
' but the central theme of his foreign policy - heavy address was that @entity15 strength would continue to come by working through international coalitions			1
@entity0 called for diplomacy and ' multilateral action ' in the face of global threats			1
his prepared remarks , distributed by the @entity22 , replaced that phrase with the words ' collective action			1
' receiving tepid applause and a short standing ovation from less than one - quarter of the audience upon his introduction , @entity0 argued for a contradictory foreign policy that relies on @entity32 and the @entity33 while insisting that ' @entity15 must always lead on the world stage			1
' ' if we do n’t , no one else will , ' he insisted			0
but ' we require partners , ' he said , using the words ' partner ' or ' partnership ' 16 times in his speech			1
' we will step up our efforts to support @entity5 ’s neighbors , ' he said , making sure that ' those countries , and not just the @entity15 , are contributing their fair share of support to the @entity5 people			2
' but he also said he would rely on other countries including @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 to ' confront terrorists working across @entity5 borders			0
' @entity22 press secretary @entity98 told reporters aboard @entity100 en route to @entity61 that ' we look at the @entity5 conflict as part of a broader counterterrorism challenge			2
' ' that is why we 're going to continue increasing our support to the moderate opposition , who offer the best alternative to both the murderous @entity83 dictatorship and the extremists who have exploited the crisis			0
' it 's not clear what form that support will take , or if the @entity15 will offer any of it on its own			2
he did say that @entity15 ' will use military force , unilaterally if necessary , when our core interests demand it – when our people are threatened ; when our livelihood is at stake ; or when the security of our allies is in danger			2
' but ' when issues of global concern that do not pose a direct threat to the @entity15 are at stake – when crises arise that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction – then the threshold for military action must be higher , ' he said			1
' in such circumstances , we should not go it alone			0
' president @entity0 handed out diplomas to the graduating class , which consisted of about 1,100 soon - to - be - commissioned officers in the @entity15 military dress uniforms on future fighters : @entity0 told happy graduating cadets that they might never be deployed to @entity95 or @entity149 ' @entity151 action : @entity153 's @entity33 ambassador @entity152 ( top , arm raised ) and @entity157 's deputy @entity33 ambassador @entity156 ( bottom , arm raised ) voted in the @entity160 against referring the @entity5 crisis to the @entity162 for investigation of war crimes @entity0 's remarks came at the @entity61 at @entity61 , @entity166			1
he proposed a $ 5 billion fund to help other countries fight terrorism not a @entity170 : the civilian commander - in - chief put his hand over his heart during the @entity174 on wednesday , while active - duty military saluted the @entity15 flag indeed , @entity0 's central foreign policy argument on wednesday was that while he ' believe [ s ] in @entity15 exceptionalism with every fiber of my being , ' @entity15 leadership in his administration will continue to consist of working through international coalitions			1
' this is @entity15 leadership , @entity15 strength , ' he said			1
@entity188 chairman @entity187 slammed @entity0 for bringing about ' a general loss of @entity15 credibility , making successful foreign policy nearly impossible ' ' of course , skeptics often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action , ' he allowed			1
' for them , working through international institutions , or respecting international law , is a sign of weakness			0
i think they ’re wrong			0
' he told @entity61 cadets that ' in the course of your service , you will work as a team with diplomats and development experts			2
you will get to know allies and train partners			0
' ' you will embody what it means for @entity15 to lead			0
' ' by most measures , ' the president said , ' @entity15 has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world			2
those who argue otherwise – who suggest that @entity15 is in decline , or has seen its global leadership slip away – are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics			1
' @entity224 in @entity1 have consistently argued that @entity0 has weakened the @entity15			1
polls in @entity226 and elsewhere indicate that citizens of foreign nations have lowered the opinions of the @entity15 since he took office			2
rep. @entity187 , a @entity231 @entity224 who chairs the @entity188 , said in a statement after @entity0 's speech that the president has made foreign policy ' assurances ' since taking office in 2009 , ' [ b ] ut too often , strong words have been followed by weak actions , or no actions			1
' ' the result has been a general loss of @entity15 credibility , making successful foreign policy nearly impossible			1
' ' the @entity246 has consistently underestimated the threats we face , ' he said , citing @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251			0
applause : during his speech , a broad defense of his foreign policy , @entity0 took a moment to recognize the former @entity61 cadets who are serving in uniform in the @entity258 @entity259 , the 2014 class " goat " who had the lowest gpa , holds up a bundle of money from his classmates -- $ 1 ion cash from each -- after graduating from the @entity61 at @entity61 @entity0 continued the tradition of presidents and vice presidents addressing @entity61 graduating classes with a contradictory foreign policy speech that argued both for @entity15 strength and for ' multilateral action ' overseas supporting @entity5 's neighbors : @entity5 citizens who live in @entity93 gathered on wednesday as @entity0 was speaking -- shouting slogans , and carrying portraits of @entity5 president @entity83 as they walked to the @entity5 embassy to vote in presidential elections terror in @entity5 : a barrel - bomb attack his the northern @entity5 city of @entity285 on may 26 ; the city is split into opposition and regime - held territories he drew cheers from graduating cadets – far more robust applause than his speech itself – by announcing a symbolic pardon for those who were ' on restriction due to minor conduct offenses ' as students			1
as they graduate , cadets are released from those punishments automatically			0
the president 's biggest applause line was not for a policy position , but in praise of a former @entity61 cadet who was wounded in @entity149			2
@entity307 ' lost one of his legs in an attack , ' @entity0 said			0
' i met him last year at @entity312			0
he was wounded , but just as determined as the day that he arrived here			0
he developed a simple goal			0
' today , his sister @entity314 will graduate			0
and true to his promise , @entity307 will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her			0

' i believe in @entity15 exceptionalism with every fiber of my being , ' the president insisted
yet he used the words ' partner ' and ' partnership ' 16 times in his speech at @entity61 , *outlining* a contradictory foreign policy
@entity0 replaced the phrase ' collective action ' – in his prepared remarks – with the words ' multilateral action ' several times
working through @entity32 and the @entity33 will dominate @entity15 foreign policy , @entity0 said : ' this is @entity15 leadership , @entity15 strength '
