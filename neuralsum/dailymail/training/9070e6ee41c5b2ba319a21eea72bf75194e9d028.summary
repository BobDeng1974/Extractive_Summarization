@entity0 said he had considered ‘ two or three others ’ – including former @entity4 journalist @entity3 – for the job by @entity5 published : 18:56 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 19:47 est , 14 june 2012 @entity6 admitted yesterday his decision to hire former @entity9 editor @entity8 had ‘ haunted ’ them both			1
the prime minister faced repeated questioning at the @entity13 over the assurances he sought from mr @entity8 about his knowledge of phone hacking at the paper before appointing him as his director of communications			1
he said he had considered ‘ two or three others ’ – including former @entity4 journalist @entity3 – for the job , but hired mr @entity8 in 2007 as ‘ the only tabloid editor available ’			1
@entity6 admitted yesterday his decision to hire former @entity9 editor @entity8 had ' haunted ' them both he insisted he , his chief of staff @entity22 and cabinet office minister @entity24 sought assurances from mr @entity8 , who resigned from the newspaper over the hacking scandal			1
‘ why did i feel he deserved a second chance ? because i thought that he had done the honourable thing			0
something very bad had happened on the newspaper he was editing			0
he did not know and he resigned , ’ mr @entity6 told the inquiry into media ethics			1
‘ there were some people in the @entity36 who would have said , “ do n’t have a tabloid editor ”			1
my view was that it was necessary to have someone tough and robust			0
’ the @entity0 said he had considered ' two or three others ' - including former @entity4 journalist @entity3 ( above ) - for the job , but hired mr @entity8 in 2007 as ' the only tabloid editor available ' mr @entity8 – who resigned in january last year and is now facing perjury charges in @entity45 as well as being on bail in relation to allegations of phone hacking – had given similar assurances that he knew nothing of phone hacking to the police , @entity54 and the @entity55 , which had all ‘ accepted his word ’ , he added			1
‘ so , yes , i accepted these undertakings but so did many other people and organisations ... i just make one point , because i recognise this is a controversial appointment			0
‘ this has come back to haunt both him and me , but in doing the job of director of communication for the party and in @entity67 he did the job very effectively			2
’ confirming that chancellor @entity70 had thought the appointment was a ‘ good idea ’ , the prime minister insisted the fact that mr @entity8 worked at and had close links with the @entity74 media empire had been irrelevant			1
the @entity75 also testified that mr @entity8 was the first @entity67 communications director of recent times not to have been properly security vetted			2
all six previous incumbents had received so - called ‘ developed vetting ’ – the most thorough such procedure – within seven months of taking the job			1
but mr @entity6 dismissed accusations he had been lax in checking mr @entity8 out and said the whole issue was a ‘ red herring ’			1
the @entity0 yesterday voiced his opposition to statutory regulation of newspapers , telling @entity88 ( above ) it would lead to ' real concerns ' that the @entity91 could be compromised @entity6 : why @entity54 must be self - regulated the prime minister yesterday voiced his opposition to statutory regulation of newspapers , telling @entity88 it would lead to ‘ real concerns ’ that the @entity91 could be compromised			1
instead , mr @entity6 advocated a ‘ genuinely independent ’ form of self - regulation ‘ with teeth ’ , saying such a system would be ‘ fantastic ’			1
and he told the inquiry the existing @entity54 under its new chief @entity100 should be given the chance to draw up this tougher , more accountable regime			0
in what was seen as a clear rejection of some of the more draconian proposals floated during the inquiry , he said : ‘ @entity54 and people who , like me , care about a free press , have a real concern about ... full - on statutory regulation			0
we have to understand the real concern there is about statutory regulation			0
' that does n’t mean you rule it out , but it means try and make everything that can be independent work before you reach for that lever			0
‘ i worked in television where we had statutory regulation			0
newspapers are different , and we have to respect that and understand that , so if we can make a self - regulatory system work that is genuinely independent , that would be fantastic			0
’ the prime minister said the new regulator should have the power to dish out significant penalties to organisations which flout the rules			0
these would include ‘ front page apologies ’ for damaging or inaccurate stories , and the possibility of hefty fines			2
he also rejected a proposal to outlaw the blurring of news and comment in newspapers			0
that idea , advanced by @entity88 , has been described as dangerous by several serving politicians , who believe it would lead to government effectively engaging in censorship			0
mr @entity6 fired another warning shot , saying : ‘ i think it ’s quite impractical			2
so often a headline encapsulates both a fact but also an opinion			0
it happens and i think it ’s rather a forlorn hope to think you can somehow separate them			0
’ mr @entity6 ’s views have been echoed by his fellow party leaders @entity159 and @entity160 , and @entity75 members @entity70 , @entity162 and @entity163			2
the @entity0 said the new system would have to be adhered to by every newspaper group and suggested that those who fail to sign up – such as the @entity167 , which pulled out of the @entity54 – could face a range of sanctions , including expulsion from the @entity171			1
he said the system could be ‘ effectively compulsory ’ if @entity175 said : ‘ if you ’re not part of this , you ’re not in the lobby , you do n’t get any information from @entity174 ’			2
he praised the ‘ good ideas ’ of @entity36 peer @entity100 , who has been working on plans to give ordinary people greater redress over stories they object to			2
and the @entity0 said it was right that ‘ those of us who put ourselves in the public eye ’ expect more scrutiny , pointing to a recent revelation about his own family			1
‘ they could probably safely leave their children in the pub and not have the same focus on them – which i do not complain about at all			2
