and today it was obvious @entity5 's @entity4 and her younger , dashing husband were still very much enjoying married life as they stepped out for a lunch date in @entity10			1
the eccentric billionairess , 85 , held hands with her 61 - year - old toyboy as they strolled the streets of the @entity16 capital			1
@entity18 's young dream : the eccentric @entity4 stepped out with her younger husband @entity19 in @entity10 sheltering from the rain : the quirky billionairess shielded her all - in - blue ensemble - which included eye liner , dress , stockings and shoes - under an umbrella dressed head to toe in several different shades of blue - which included a hairpiece , shoes , dress and stockings - the quirky duchess clung to her husband 's arm as they browsed a book shop			1
the couple married in a flamboyant ceremony last october ; the bride , an eccentric billionaire with more titles than @entity48 while her groom was a mere civil servant young enough to be her son			1
but despite the objections of her six children - and plenty of public controversy - @entity5 ’s colourful @entity4 wed @entity55 at her 15th century palace in @entity57			1
the famously flamboyant @entity58 wore a delicate pale pink gown designed by @entity60 for her third marriage , which took place in front of 38 guests			0
well - wishers donned fancy dress and wigs in an attempt to copy her quirky style as they celebrated in the city ’s streets			2
the twice - widowed @entity4 ’s children feared @entity19 was a gold - digger - so he has relinquished his rights to her £ 3billion fortune in an effort to appease them			2
out and about : the couple enjoyed lunch at @entity81 before heading out to do some shopping			1
@entity83 was also seem clutching the arm of another companion during the outing special day : the wealthy duchess and her toyboy on their wedding day in @entity57 six months ago the duchess , who is a distant relative of @entity93 and princess @entity94 , went ahead with the marriage despite her children ’s qualms			0
it emerged in august that she has divided her fortune between her six children to convince them that her suitor is besotted with her rather than her money			0
known now for her frizzy white hair , squeaky voice and wildly colourful clothes , the duchess is among @entity5 ’s most famous people last year , she was at the centre of a sex scandal when @entity5 magazine @entity110 published a 30 - year - old picture on its front cover of the duchess sunbathing topless in @entity115			2
she and @entity19 , a social security administration employee , are old acquaintances through her second husband , who was a former priest , and @entity19 ’s brother			0
they bumped into each other about three years ago outside a cinema in @entity122 and eventually started dating .			0
