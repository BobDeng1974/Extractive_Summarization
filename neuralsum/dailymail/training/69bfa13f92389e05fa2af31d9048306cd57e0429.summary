@entity1 loanee @entity0 could yet be back in the @entity2 with @entity3 after helping fire them into an automatic - promotion place			1
the 21 - year - old harbours ambition of returning to @entity7 as part of @entity11 ’s senior set - up next season			0
but given @entity0 ’s tender years and the likes of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 ahead of him in the pecking order , @entity3 boss @entity12 could well use his friendship with @entity11 to secure the striker for another season should they win promotion			1
@entity3 centre forward @entity0 is overjoyed after he opens the scoring in the 63rd minute @entity26 races away to celebrate after he broke the deadlock at the @entity28 @entity29 ( second right ) celebrates after he doubles @entity3 's advantage in the 79th minute ‘ i was very pleased when @entity0 extended his loan here ( on january 1 )			1
he looks a better player every day , ’ said the former @entity33 assistant manager			0
‘ he is more mature			0
it was important for @entity0 to score tonight ( after six games without a goal )			2
’ @entity12 ’s side travel to @entity43 in the @entity45 fourth round on saturday but , @entity0 apart , there was little to worry the team who also sit second in the @entity2			1
the @entity48 have struggled for goals in recent weeks and that much was apparent during the first half			0
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity51 competes for the ball with @entity54 's @entity53 @entity54 's @entity55 ( centre ) controls the ball under pressure from @entity3 's @entity59 ( right ) @entity29 ( left ) gets down low to clear the ball as @entity61 attempts a shot for @entity54 the best chance was fashioned after just 30 seconds , @entity64 escaping down the right and drawing back for @entity66 , unmarked on the edge of the area			1
a heavy first touch robbed the @entity70 of space and the resulting snap shot was blocked by the sliding @entity73			0
that excitement was not a sign of things to come			0
just before the break @entity0 drilled wide from 30 yards and that was as close as either side came to an opener			2
but the @entity81 got his goal on 63 minutes			0
@entity83 scampered down the left and centred for @entity26 and , when his first effort was blocked , he seized on the loose ball before smashing home			0
@entity54 winger @entity88 gets a shot away during a tense first - half of action at the @entity28 substitute @entity92 had the chance to put the game to bed when freed by @entity0 but his low blast was smothered by @entity97			1
however , @entity29 was to make no mistake on 79 minutes with @entity83 again the provider from the left , the striker accepting the invitation of a side - footed finish from close range			2
there was a late scare when former @entity108 forward @entity107 headed a response for the visitors but @entity3 held on to move within one point of leaders @entity113 after their surprise defeat at @entity115 .			1

@entity0 fired @entity3 into the lead in the 63rd minute
@entity29 doubled @entity3 's advantage 16 minutes later
