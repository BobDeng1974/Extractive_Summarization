@entity0 kept his footing on the slipway down which the @entity3 slid towards disaster and brought his first world title home to @entity7			1
the @entity9 ’s speed of hand as well as movement overwhelmed @entity13 ’s defence of his @entity15 super-bantamweight title			1
@entity16 , reconciled behind its new standard bearer for an improved present and a better future , rejoiced			0
@entity0 ’s classy exhibition of counter-punch boxing gave him a runaway victory , even though his gallant @entity40 opponent kept coming through the pain and punishment to give the fans a fight to keep watching			1
those heroics gave @entity13 one round and a share of the last by my 119 - 109 reckoning			1
two of the judges went one point better at 119 - 108 , while the third gave @entity13 a sympathy score of 118 - 111			1
@entity9 could could not deliver the knock - out for which the crowd were baying			0
but this performance put the cement in the bricks of reconciliation in @entity7 which his manager and mentor , the @entity62 legend @entity61 , began constructing with his own world title exploits back in the 1980s			1
a rich future involving championship unification fights beckons			0
@entity0 would prefer the first of those to be against @entity72 rival @entity70 , holder of the ‘ regular ’ @entity75 title			1
as the @entity15 belt was strapped about him he said : ‘ i ’ll fight @entity70 anywhere			1
and he needs to remember that i ’m the one holding a proper world title			0
' a mandatory may intervene early next year but @entity0 is close to being the finished article after this , only his 19th fight			1
close up : @entity0 picked the champion off throughout to build up a healthy lead on the @entity84 and the new : @entity0 is announced as the new world champion after dethroning @entity13 in @entity7 following in his footsteps : @entity0 is hugged by his manager and former world champion @entity61 his inability to repeat – or even improve upon – his ninth round stoppage of @entity13 here last year suggests he still has to sharpen his killer instinct when he has a top - class fighter in trouble			1
the one knock - down he landed should have encouraged him to shed the last vestiges of caution			0
but this was a stylish 12 rounds of work and @entity100 has another worthy champion to celebrate			0
@entity9 , as challenger , had entered the ring first to a great howl of acclaim from the @entity16 gathering reconciled behind their symbol of the new @entity7			2
had this been indoors the din would have been deafening			0
but although a little of the euphoria dissipated into the cold night air it was still an electrifying atmosphere in a statement venue			0
the formalities of the first round were less rousing but @entity0 connected with enough crisp rights to take it			2
@entity13 sensed he had to march into the line of fire but was repeatedly picked off			2
when he did get to close quarters @entity0 was the sharper in - fighter			2
although he walked on to one right himself he was already building a solid lead			0
@entity13 had done well to regroup and win the @entity15 belt since losing to @entity0 last year but the @entity126 looked to have improved even more			1
this was growing into an impressive evening for @entity0 – and a potentially long one for a champion who could not land cleanly			2
@entity0 was down early in the fifth but @entity72 referee @entity129 ruled it a slip – not to the approval of all in the @entity31			0
there was no doubt when @entity0 connected with the sharp right which decked the champion			0
@entity13 also suffered a slight cut as he battled to stay in the fight			2
going for it : @entity13 did well to last the full 12 rounds as he tied to push @entity140 on to the backfoot swinging : @entity0 now wants a unification with @entity143 's @entity70 who has the @entity75 belt this was one way traffic and @entity13 needed all his courage keep resisting the storm			1
the @entity0 left was as wound as the right now and the @entity150 was beginning to resemble a bull being stuck by the picador			0
the chance was there for @entity9 to improve on his ninth - round stoppage first time it was almost a novelty when @entity13 connected with a cuffing left hook – but he was punished by a stinging @entity0 combination for his trouble			1
still @entity13 kept coming – and getting hit			0
@entity13 at last enjoyed some success in the eighth session			0
after outscoring the challenger in the clinches he shook @entity0 with a left and a right and finally had a round to call his own			2
an encouraged @entity13 raised the pace at the start of the next but after forcing @entity0 even further on to the back foot he shipped more damaging counter punches			1
@entity13 needed a knockout to keep his title but he was the one being rocked repeatedly			2
but although the crowd appreciated the quick , slick quality of their man ’s work they were growing a mite impatient for a knock - out finish			0
the tenth was another round in the @entity16 bag			0
but for a cautious tendency @entity0 would surely have finished it by now			0
the faithful were not as animated but a sudden burst of @entity7 aggression had them back on their feet and @entity13 did well to make it to the bell			1
the pair embraced at the start of the last round , one acknowledging the skill and one the courage of the other			0
again the gallant @entity150 survived a barrage as @entity0 went for the grandstand finish , the knock - out punch did not materialise and @entity13 battled for a deserved share of the 12th			1
it was a landslide victory for @entity0 ; his first world title was well won , if not in fully spectacular fashion .			1

@entity0 *outpointed* @entity13 to win @entity15 super-bantamweight title
@entity13 was down in the fifth round but recovered to hear the final bell
@entity0 beat @entity13 for a second time following their first fight in 2013
@entity7 man won by scores of 119 - 108 , 119 - 108 and 118 - 111
