a suburban @entity1 police officer has been fired and a handful of others are under investigation after surveillance footage showed a cop cut off a young mother ’s weave			1
@entity10 ’s weave was crudely chopped off late last year by former @entity12 police officer @entity11 using a pair of scissors after she was arrested for trashing a seedy motel on the notorious 8 mile road			1
the weave was removed , ms @entity11 told her superiors , because ms @entity10 was deemed a suicide risk – reasoning that police commissioner @entity19 told @entity20 ‘ makes no sense			1
and to me this is something that i wo n’t tolerate , ’ mr @entity19 told the station			0
; “ i do n’t buy that ’s the proper way to treat a human being			0

ms @entity46 is shown pushing ms @entity10 multiple times before she and three fellow officers drag the woman to a holding chair and strap down her limbs			1
' bald in some spots ' : ms @entity10 claims she ca n't grow all of her hair back because the officer ripped it out by the roots write caption here drugged and taken here : ms @entity10 claims she was drugged at the party and taken to this seedy motel on the notorious @entity61 the disgraced officer then pulls out a pair of scissors and begins chopping off large chunks of the restrained woman ’s hair , the pain is so intense her legs flail in agony			1
‘ she took it upon herself to get the scissors			0
and for whatever reason , decided that she was going to butcher my client , ’ lawyer @entity71 said			0
the demeaning ordeal is not finished until ms @entity46 finishes by forcibly yanking a big chunk of hair from ms @entity10 ’s head – which she says left her bald in spots as a result of the hair being pulled out by the roots			1
‘ she ’s a very horrible person , ’ ms @entity10 said			2
‘ i guess the best way to describe it would be sadistic , ’ her attorney added			0
’ there ’s absolutely no reason for it			0

it was not her first disciplinary action			0
