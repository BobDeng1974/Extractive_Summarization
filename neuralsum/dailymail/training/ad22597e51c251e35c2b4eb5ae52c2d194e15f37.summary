by @entity1 reporter trapped : @entity2 , 19 , stopped growing just before her second birthday and must be carried everywhere by her mother @entity4 , 42 at first glance @entity5 could be any little girl , playing with her brothers and sisters and getting a hug from her doting mother			1
but although @entity5 looks like a toddler , she is in fact 19 , having stopped growing just before her second birthday			1
@entity5 weighs just 1st 3lbs , and still needs to be spoon - fed and carried everywhere by her mother @entity4 , 42			1
the teenager was a healthy baby when she was born in 1994 and it was n't long before she started to walk and talk			2
however , her development then stalled			0
doctors initially told her mother and father , @entity18 , 52 , that @entity5 would start growing again			2
they then blamed cancer for her condition , before suggesting that it could be a hormone disorder and the family are still at a loss as to why @entity24 is how she is			1
scientists believe that @entity5 could have @entity26 , a rare genetic condition , which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - with a third of them living in in remote villages in @entity34 ’s southern @entity33			1
people living with @entity36 lack a hormone called @entity38 , or @entity38 , which stimulates the cell to grow and divide to form new cells			0
too much of the hormone can lead a person to develop breast , prostate or bowel cancers at an early age , meaning people with @entity36 will never get cancer , or diabetes			2
' @entity24 is likely to maintain her childlike features for the majority of her life , ' @entity49 from the @entity50 told @entity55 mr @entity54 believes @entity5 ' probably ' has @entity26			1
brothers and sisters : @entity24 ( front ) with her siblings ( left to right ) @entity60 , eight , @entity61 , 14 and 17 - year - old @entity62 @entity5 's younger sisters @entity62 , 17 , @entity61 , 14 , and brother @entity60 , eight , now tower over her , while her vocabulary extends only to ' maa ' , for mother , ' baba ' for father , and ' didi ' for sister			1
she is physically and cognitively similar to a two - year - old , and has an iq of less than 20			1
her condition bears an uncanny resemblance to a @entity77 woman , @entity76 , who died in october last year aged 20 after puzzling doctors for years			2
no formal diagnosis for @entity76 ’s condition was ever given , leading doctors to term it ' @entity76 '			0
friends : @entity5 passes the time playing with local children , only able to take a few baby steps without help instead of going to school or out to work like her peers and siblings , @entity5 , who lives in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , passes the time playing with local children , only able to take a few baby steps without help			2
' she 's a delight and always has a smile on her face , but it 's heartbreaking to see her trapped in this life , ' mrs @entity5 told @entity55 her father said his ' beautiful ' daughter is always smiling and brings joy to her family			2
' she does n't communicate much but she knows what 's going on around her , ' he said			0
similarity : @entity5 's condition bears an uncanny resemblance to a @entity77 woman , @entity76 , who died in october last year aged 20 after puzzling doctors for years : @entity76 , then 16 , with her parents , her younger sister @entity113 , then 13 ( second left ) and their older sister @entity113 , then 19 ( left )			1
no formal diagnosis for @entity76 's condition was ever given , leading doctors to term it ' @entity76 ' theory : scientists believe that @entity5 could have @entity26 , a rare genetic condition , which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - including these people in @entity34 an @entity34 man with @entity26 ( pictured with his children in the early 1990s ) scientists have suggested that @entity5 could have @entity26 , which has been diagnosed in just 300 people across the globe			1
the syndrome is named for @entity130 endocrinologist @entity36 , who in the late 1950s began studying patients , some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual development disorders			0
his earliest patients included three young siblings — two boys and a girl — all with severely stunted growth			0
they were all obese , with thin hair , pronounced foreheads , and a collapsed nasal bridge , and their grandparents were first cousins			0
@entity36 assumed they had a severe shortage of growth hormone , but some years later , after new blood tests were developed , it transpired the levels of growth hormone were abnormal — they were extremely high			0
by the mid- 1960s he had identified 20 more such people			0
he reasoned that either they had defective hormones , or something was wrong with the cells that respond to those hormones			0
people who inherit the rare genetic condition do not produce a hormone called @entity38 , or @entity38 , and are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer			1
it is @entity38 , not growth hormone , that stimulates the cell to grow and divide to form new cells			0
too much of the hormone can lead a person to develop breast , prostate or bowel cancers at an early age			0
scientists are now developing a drug which they hope will do artificially what the genetic defect in @entity26 does naturally - protect against dna damage that fuels cancer growth			1
people with @entity26 are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft			2
a third of those diagnosed live in remote villages in @entity34 ’s southern @entity33 .			0

@entity5 , 19 , is is physically and cognitively similar to a two - year - old
she weighs 1st 3lbs and must be carried everywhere by her mother @entity4
the teen was a healthy baby but stopped growing before turning two
doctors have blames cancer and a hormone disorder for her condition
@entity198 still do not know why @entity24 's development appears to have stalled
scientists suggest she could have @entity26
rare genetic condition has affected just 300 people *worldwide*
