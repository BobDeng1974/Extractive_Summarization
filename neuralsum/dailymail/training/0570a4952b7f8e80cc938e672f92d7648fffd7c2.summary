@entity0 have ramped up the post @entity2 feelgood factor by finally landing @entity4 and @entity5 from @entity6			1
the captures of the @entity9 pair for a combined £ 2million fee signalled a shift in the @entity14 club ’s transfer strategy back towards home - spun talents			0
a left - field move for @entity19 striker @entity18 failed to materialise and on deadline day @entity6 moved in and were putting the finishing touches to his transfer to @entity23			2
but @entity25 winger @entity24 completed his move to @entity14 as expected			1
@entity4 has signed for @entity0 as the @entity28 champions completed their transfers @entity5 also arrived from @entity6 on transfer deadline day @entity4 poses with @entity0 chief executive @entity31 inside the stadium @entity24 was a left - field arrival at @entity14 from @entity25 however , it is the completion of moves for two of the @entity39 game ’s brightest lights that will leave fans of the champions convinced that @entity43 ’s reign will now go from strength to strength			1
@entity5 had already agreed to join @entity0 under freedom of contract this summer , but last week the champions had a bid of £ 150,000 to take him immediately rejected			2
matters gathered apace on monday evening , however , with an improved £ 250,000 offer finally matching @entity6 ’s valuation			0
@entity0 had started the day by improving upon an earlier bid of £ 1.5m for @entity4 , only to have that kicked into touch			0
their willingness to up the fee to around £ 1.75m finally saw @entity6 cave in and the player travelled with his team - mate to @entity60 for medicals before the deals were sealed			0
while @entity6 have now sold £ 8m of talent since the summer — with @entity66 ’s @entity65 and @entity68 ’s @entity67 netting them £ 3m apiece — they will now face @entity0 in the @entity69 on march 15 without their two prized assets			1
neither player can turn out for @entity0 , however , because they are cup tied			0
@entity4 celebrates scoring the opening goal for @entity6 against @entity0 last year @entity5 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) are two of @entity75 's hottest young talents former @entity76 and @entity77 youth player @entity5 , 24 , won his first full @entity75 cap against the @entity79 in 2011			1
@entity4 , 22 , started out at @entity80 before joining @entity6 in 2010 and @entity81 rewarded his progress with a place in the @entity75 squad which travelled to @entity85 two years ago			0
the capture of @entity24 proved a rather more straightforward deal with the @entity88 under - 21 winger moving to @entity60 for a nominal fee after a successful trial			2
@entity92 remains a @entity0 player — for the time being — after an expected bid from @entity96 failed to materialise on monday night			1
@entity97 had hoped to use the proceeds from the £ 1m sale of lee chung - yong to @entity101 to fund the move but with that transfer going to the wire there was insufficient time for him to test the resolve of his former club			0
@entity92 could still leave the club in the summer with @entity96 manager @entity97 keen @entity97 remains keen to be reunited with @entity92 in the @entity110 and will get his wish by agreeing a pre-contract agreement next week unless the player is granted the straight two - year deal he desires with @entity0 before then			1
the prospect of @entity0 moving for @entity116 floundered when he moved from @entity101 to @entity96 on loan while speculation linking @entity43 with a spectacular swoop for @entity120 ended when he joined @entity121			2
while @entity4 and @entity5 signed for @entity0 , former @entity6 defender @entity122 , 28 , rejoined the @entity9 club from @entity124			1
but @entity6 failed in a bid to lure their former midfielder @entity126 back from @entity127 .			0

@entity0 had been *pursuing* @entity6 duo throughout *january*
club also sign @entity25 winger @entity24
@entity92 could still leave for @entity96 in the summer
