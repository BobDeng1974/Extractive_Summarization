@entity0 , one of the @entity2 leaders called to a meeting with @entity4 as the @entity6 siege unfolded , is in no doubt that gunman man @entity8 would have surrendered , if he had been allowed to talk with him			1
' they could have let someone like me talk with him , someone who had met him before , i knew him and i would have got him to surrender , i am fairly confident , ' mr @entity0 said			0
he said neither his offer nor that of other community leaders made during the day , including that of @entity18 's most senior @entity2 cleric the @entity17 , was accepted			1
further , he added , they were not sought out for any advice as it dragged on			0
' i was saying it all day , let us help			0
@entity26 founder @entity0 is pictured on his way to a meeting with government officials last year to discuss the counter-terrorism laws			1
he says police should have involved @entity2 leaders in negotiations with @entity6 siege gunman man @entity8 the same year in which @entity37 gunman @entity36 ( left ) was dropped from the national watch lists , it ’s been revealed he was also reported to @entity4 for repeatedly threatening an @entity26 school principal			1
@entity26 founder @entity0 said police should have let him talk to the hostage - taker during the @entity42 cafe stand - off last month			1
' this person was looking for someone to pull him out of it , ' mr @entity0 said			0
it 's believed among those represented at the monday morning ( december 15 ) briefing with the @entity4 , which was in relation to anti-terror raids and not the early stages of the siege , were representatives of the @entity26 , @entity54 of @entity55 , the @entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 and a former @entity4 official of @entity2 background			1
word of the drama in @entity6 's @entity63 had begun to filter through to the 10am gathering at a @entity66 hotel in the city 's south - west and those involved in the meeting say they made it known they wanted to be involved , if required			1
the official briefing was quickly wound up but mr @entity0 , who is the founder of the @entity26 , revealed that there were tense scenes even as the meeting came to an end			1
he said some at the gathering disagreed over the potential level of involvement from the @entity82 , saying ' we had an argument '			2
vision inside the @entity42 cafe of long gunman man @entity8 during the 17 - hour stand - off			1
he took 18 hostages two of the hostages are pictured up against the cafe windows during the earliest hours of the tragic @entity6 siege			2
a @entity2 leader claimed on tuesday that if he had been given the opportunity to talk to the gunman , bloodshed could have been avoided at @entity97 the dramatic last moments of the @entity6 siege at the @entity42 cafe in @entity97 as hostages run for their lives after surviving almost 17 hours as captors of gunman @entity36 mr @entity0 insists that , while he understood the authorities held concern for the safety of civilian in such a risky operation , he would have happily signed a waiver accepting responsibility for his actions , should he have been harmed by the gunman			1
on his side , he said , were younger members of the @entity82 , who were also present at the meeting : ' they were ready to go too , there were two of them dressed in their traditional robes and they agreed and said " if it is a young person , we will talk to him " and they were available at any time			2
' mr @entity0 also wants answers , as to why officials were selective in who was told the vital information about @entity8 ' identity as the day wore on			2
' they told some community leaders ( @entity8 ' identity ) and not me but i would have happily signed a letter taking responsibility , ' he said			2
heavily armed police stormed the @entity42 cafe in the early hours of tuesday morning after hostage - taker @entity8 fired shots			1
two of his captors were killed , @entity139 and @entity140 man @entity8 pictured in 2009 , bound in chains and holding an @entity18 flag outside @entity144 in @entity6			1
he 'd been charged with seven counts of unlawfully using the postal service to menace , after sending harassing letters to families of @entity18 soldiers			2
he would later be granted bail despite facing sexual assault and accessory to murder charges the anguish of hostages taken by @entity8 inside the @entity42 cafe was clearly visible , as the stand - off crippled the heart of @entity6 last month a decision on the future of the @entity160 has yet to be made by the owners , almost a month after the tragic events in @entity97 ' i find it difficult to believe he knew what he was doing , he did not plan it , he had no idea what he wanted			1
' someone like that needs someone to talk to , talk him around and tell him " let these people go "			0
' i was saying it all day , that would have been the best way to deal with this guy was this way , i am certain			0
' more than 100,000 bouquets were placed at the shrine in @entity97 in the days after the siege			2
the flowers placed in memory of the @entity42 cafe siege hostages will feature as part of a permanent memorial , after having been mulched ' i had a couple of meetings with him and he just needed someone to guide him			0
we were all ready to help , even the @entity17 offered to go and speak to him			0
' this person was looking for someone to pull him out of it			0
' it 's been revealed the @entity17 of @entity18 , dr @entity197 , was ready to become involved but was not sought for advice nor involved at an official level , with senior police admitting at the time that even 11 hours into the stand - off there had been limited , if any , contact directly with the gunman			1
' at the time i did n’t know it was him			0
i had met him before and if i had known earlier it was him i would ’ve been happy to try and talk to him , i ’m sure he would n’t have done anything to me at that stage , ” mr @entity0 said			0
while others suggest police erred in not taking advice from @entity2 community leaders , @entity211 of the @entity212 sees it differently saying ' i ca n't really find any fault in what they have done			1
they were being very , very careful not to risk people 's lives ' however , others present at the meeting on monday morning were n't as critical			2
' no one really knew , at that stage , ' said @entity211 of the @entity212			0
' i ca n't really find any fault in what they have done			0
they were being very , very careful not to risk people 's lives , we do n't know all that went on , it is a tricky situation			0
i knew who he was by 3pm that day			0
' hindsight is a wonderful thing , is n't it ? ' mr @entity211 added .			0
