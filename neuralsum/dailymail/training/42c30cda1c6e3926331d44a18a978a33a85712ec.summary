she cost around £ 1billion to build , has sonar so sensitive it can hear other vessels 3,000 miles away and carries a giant payload of 38 deadly @entity6 cruise missiles			1
@entity7 , the @entity8 's newest nuclear attack submarine , is one of the most sophisticated and powerful vessels of her type ever built			1
the giant @entity13 - class sub , which was launched today , is so hi - tech she does n't even need a periscope			1
scroll down to watch the submarine 's weapons being tested ... awesome : @entity7 , which was built by @entity18 , is believed to be the world 's most powerful nuclear attack submarine			1
her huge weapons payload includes super-accurate @entity6 cruise missiles and @entity25 torpedoes for fighting other vessels success : the super hi - tech vessel has undergone rigorous testing ahead of today 's launch			1
despite her size the sub 's 103 crew will be tightly packed , with some sleeping up to eight to a room in bunk beds @entity36 @entity37 sophisticated : a cross-section of the sub shows the complexity of her design and the need to fit as much technology in as possible her crew instead using a digital camera system to see above the surface when she is submerged			0
built by @entity18 , she has enough nuclear fuel to carry on cruising for up to 25 years non-stop - giving her huge tactical flexibility			1
her nuclear reactor is so powerful her range is only really limited by the need for maintenance and resupply			1
astute - class submarines are the largest , most advanced and most powerful in the history of the @entity8 , boasting world - class design , weaponry and versatility			2
@entity7 can travel over 500 miles in a day , allowing them to be deployed anywhere in the world within two weeks			2
the vessel is also one of the quietest sea - going vessels built , capable of sneaking along an enemy coastline to drop off special forces or tracking a boat for weeks			2
detailed : @entity7 was fitted out with her sophisticated technology at @entity71 in @entity72			2
she contains some of the most hi - tech weapons and sonar systems ever created @entity7 : her powerful nuclear reactor allows her to travel around the world without stopping			1
she can cruise for up to 500 miles in a day foreign forces will find it almost impossible to sneak up undetected by her incredibly powerful sonar equipment that can hear halfway around the world			1
her @entity6 missiles are capable of hitting targets up to 1,200 miles away - making her a vital weapon for @entity88 's armed forces			1

many details of her weapons system remain top secret feeding the crew : the submarine 's kitchen will be staffed by five chefs providing food 24 - hours a day for her officers and crew technology : leading engineering technician @entity118 tests out the sub 's steering system in the control room ' it is possible this class of submarine is the most advanced in the world			2
' another @entity127 sub is currently undergoing sea trials – and could be operational within a year			0
many details of @entity7 's weapons systems can not be revealed for security reasons			0
most of her 103 - strong crew live in bunk - beds measuring two metres by one metre , with up to 18 submariners sharing one room			0
