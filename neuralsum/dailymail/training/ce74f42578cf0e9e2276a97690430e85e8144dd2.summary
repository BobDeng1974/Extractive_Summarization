it has been almost 125 years since a cardboard tube was first inserted into a roll of toilet paper			1
but now engineers at an @entity6 company have decided to remove it and replace the tube with – nothing , in an attempt to cut down on waste			0
@entity12 says the simple step could eliminate a large chunk of 17 billion cardboard tubes thrown away each year - enough to fill the @entity16 twice			1
@entity12 says the simple step of removing the centre tube in its @entity20 bathroom tissue could eliminate a large chunk of 17 billion tubes thrown away each year scientists , based in @entity24 , @entity25 , developed the tubeless toilet paper roll for @entity27 and it has been test marketed on a limited scale in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
it is now being launched nationwide through @entity35 stores			1
@entity36 , brand manager for @entity37 , said : ' you just put it on the spindle like regular bath tissue			0
and when you get to that last sheet , it just rolls off			0
there 's no wasted cardboard tube left behind			1
' we know the vast majority of @entity6 consumers want to be greener , but they are unwilling to pay extra for it , and they are unwilling to sacrifice quality for it			0
' @entity52 was the first bathroom tissue maker to insert a cardboard tube into the roll , back in 1890 the cost to the company is about the same , according to @entity12 , with the cost saved by removing the tube offset by the changes in manufacturing			1
' if this were easy , other brands would be doing it , ' said @entity36			0
the tubeless roll will work with any dispenser , but it wobbles slightly as it is unwound , according to manufacturers			1
' as a father of very small kids , i actually like because the toilet paper wo n't fly off the roll quite so quickly if a child runs with it , ' said @entity36			1
@entity12 said it will not be eliminating any jobs in its plants by dumping the toilet paper tube			1
@entity78 president of @entity80 , agrees that it 's a good idea if it keeps the tubes out of landfills and sewage systems as some people flush them down the toilet			2
he said : ' those paper tubes hardly ever make it to the recycling collection center , even though they 're made from recycled content			2
' the only issue is whether the core is big enough to accommodate the multiple types of dispensers			0
depending on the dispenser , that could be a problem			0
' @entity52 was the first bathroom tissue maker to insert a cardboard tube into the roll , back in 1890			1
@entity100 and @entity37 , from @entity30 , launched the concept of toilet paper on a cardboard roll in 1890			1
the @entity105 ' brand became more successful than the medicated wipes used at the time			0
by the end of the 19th century , more homes were being built with sit - down flush toilets tied to indoor plumbing systems			0
and because people required something that could be flushed away with minimal damage , toilet paper adverts boasted that the product was recommended by both doctors and plumbers			2
in the early 1900s , toilet paper was still being marketed as a medicinal item			2
but in 1928 , @entity121 tried a different tactic and introduced a brand called @entity124			0
the product was fitted with a feminine logo that depicted a beautiful woman and this proved to be successful			0
currently , the @entity6 spends more than $ 6billion a year on toilet tissue — more than any other nation in the world			2
@entity6 , on average , use 57 squares a day and 50 lbs. a year .			0
