the book - which has never been seen in public before - dates from 1942 when he was working at @entity14 to break the @entity16 code			1
it contains 56 pages of handwritten workings and provides a remarkable insight into the thought process of a genius			1
in the pad , bought in @entity24 , mr @entity3 writes about how extremely difficult it is to understand the @entity27 notation			0
he wrote : ' the @entity27 notation i find extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one i understood the best once ! it certainly implies that some relation between x and y has been laid down eg , y = x2 +3x ? ' the colourful covered notebook is made up of complicated mathematical workings and is split into three parts - with the first two sections consisting of mr @entity3 's maths notes			1
the third part belongs to @entity41 , a friend and fellow mathematician , who was handed the notebook by mr @entity3			2
mr @entity41 , who donated most of mr @entity3 's papers to the archive at @entity46 , @entity24 , kept the notebook and wrote deeply personal dream sequences in it at the request of his psychiatrist			1
