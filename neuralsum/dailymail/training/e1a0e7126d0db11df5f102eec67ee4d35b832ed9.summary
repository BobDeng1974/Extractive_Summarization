and as we approach bikini season , it seems that these images are doing more than simply turning women in the @entity21 green with envy			1
more and more people are opting to invest in body - sculpting cosmetic procedures to help them achieve the ultimate toned figure in the lead - up to summer			0
new treatment trend : rather than pinpointing one ' problem area ' to target , more of us are opting to target multiple areas of our bodies in order to achieve an all over sculpted figure			1
@entity34 , pictures , left , before and , right , after tried it out according to one cosmetic surgery group , demand for body shaping procedures is on the up			2
the @entity42 of @entity43 has witnessed a 21 per cent increase , year on year , in the number of women opting to undergo @entity48 liposuction , a minimally invasive procedure which gently sculpts areas of the body			1
but rather than pinpointing one ' problem area ' to target , more of us are opting to target multiple areas of our bodies in order to achieve an all over sculpted figure ready for when we need to pull out the bikini			1
dr @entity59 , cosmetic doctor at @entity60 , said : ' many female patients i see explain that , for them , the ultimate goal is to look good and feel confident in a bikini			1
patients are often influenced by photographs of female celebrities looking toned and in shape in swimwear , but i think the change has also been triggered by a gradual change in attitudes amongst women			1
bottoms up ! one clinic has witnessed a 21 per cent increase , year on year , in the number of women opting to undergo the minimally invasive procedure which gently sculpts areas of the body , like the bottom , pictured , left , after and , right , before ' in particular , the notion of one " problem area " on the body is slowly disappearing and instead women are working harder to achieve the overall body size and shape they desire by combining a body sculpting procedure such as @entity48 with an active exercise regime and a healthy , nutritious diet			1
' of all female patients who underwent the treatment , almost three quarters of them ( 73 per cent ) decided to target two or more areas of their body , as opposed to targeting just one problem area			1
dr @entity59 believes these figures are particularly important : ' the fact that only around a quarter of female patients pinpoint one area that they would like to sculpt tells us that the objectives of women in terms of their body shape is perhaps changing slightly			1
' years ago it was very common for women to come to me looking to remove fat from their thighs , for example , or to sculpt and shape their flanks alone			2
now , however , this approach has become less common and we are witnessing the prevalence of a more holistic approach			0
this is also , i believe , a result of advances in technology that have led to quicker recovery times and a faster return to work for patients			0
what 's the reason ? dr @entity59 believes that the objectives of women in terms of their body shape is perhaps changing slightly as they opt to target all over - is this celebrity culture 's fault ? @entity34 pictured , left , after and , right , before ' more and more female patients today understand that a cosmetic procedure which sculpts multiple areas of the body can help them towards achieving the body shape and size they desire , but that this is only the case if they combine such a procedure with a healthy diet and a positive exercise regime			1
' the majority of patients now understand that cosmetic surgery is not a quick fix but is something which , when delivered hand in hand with an overall healthy lifestyle , can help them towards achieving their goals			0
this more holistic approach to shaping up is a trend i expect to see continue			0
' one patient who has undergone the treatment is 27 - year - old @entity34			2
@entity34 , from @entity159 is size 14 and opted to target her stomach , hips , inner , front and outer thighs , her saddle bags and her chin			1
body confident : @entity34 , pictured , left after and , right , before , says she still has a curvy figure but feels her body looks more sculpted and she have better definition ' i have always had an hour glass figure , ' she said			2
' i have a small waist , curvy hips , and quite large thighs			0
i eat well , i go to the gym regularly and i do n’t mind having a curvy figure , but i have always wished that my body was more toned and sculpted			0
there were always areas , like my hips and my inner thighs , which i just wished i could tone up			2
' i decided to undergo this , not as a quick fix solution , but as a means of targeting the stubborn areas of fat on my body			0
i felt the procedure would help give me the motivation i needed , moving forward , to keep my body in the shape i wanted it to be			0
' now , after the procedure , i still have a really curvy figure but i feel my body looks more sculpted and i have better definition			0
i feel more confident in a bikini and generally just a lot more positive about my body shape			0
' is it all her fault ? @entity5 has previously stated that her penchant for post-pregnancy selfies and belfies is her way of putting ' two fingers up ' to those who criticised her baby body - and it seems she 's inspiring women to get body sculpting treatments			0
