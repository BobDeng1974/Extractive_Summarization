an entrepreneur is hoping to make a tidy sum out of the tragedy of the @entity4 outbreak by selling a domain using the virus ' name for a six figure sum			1
@entity9 , who monitors a number of ' disease domains ' from his home in @entity13 , bought @entity14 in 2008 and now believes he can sell it for $ 150,000			1
the businessman also owns @entity17 and @entity18 , as well a domain for the deadly mosquito - borne disease @entity21 and another for the @entity4 - like marburg virus			1
he paid $ 13,500 for his @entity4 domain four years ago and has been waiting for the moment to sell			1
' there could be many other applications as well			0
with so many people concerned about the disease , any advertisement referring people to @entity14 should get an excellent response			0
' in an interview with the @entity48 , mr @entity9 said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for @entity14			2
' according to our site meter , we 're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in @entity54 to see what 's there , ' he said			0
' we 're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it			0
i have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business , and my sense is that $ 150,000 is reasonable			2
' mr @entity9 , who also owns @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy			2
the @entity71 called the outbreak ' most severe acute health emergency in modern times ' ' but you could say the same thing about doctors , ' @entity75 told the @entity48			0
' they can become very well - off treating very sick patients			0
' besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about @entity4 on the site			2
and people can also donate to @entity87 at the site			0
' the hemorrhagic fever , which has no proven cure , has killed more than 4,000 people in @entity29 since an outbreak that began in march			2
the @entity71 called the outbreak ' most severe acute health emergency in modern times '			0
the risks of failing to contain @entity4 in @entity29 have come into sharp focus in the @entity97 after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on @entity97 soil , @entity101 , died last week			1
@entity102 , a professor at the @entity103 in @entity104 is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using ' crowdfunding ' on the internet mr @entity9 told the @entity48 he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may ' ameliorate ' the outbreak , diminishing @entity4 's news value and the value of the domain			1
' @entity4 is either something that could become more of a problem , or it 's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer , ' he said			1
but the entrepreneur still has other domain 's to fall back on should @entity119 lose its value			0
' our domain , birdflu.com , is worth way more than @entity14			0
we 're definitely holding onto that one for the event , ' he said , referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than @entity4			1
@entity128 used to treat aid worker dr. @entity129 ( pictured )			0
an appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs ' that one 's airborne and @entity4 would never go airborne in the @entity97 like bird flu can			1
' in @entity137 , a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money			2
but rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist @entity102 is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus			1
the professor at the @entity103 in @entity104 is hoping that @entity145 ' crowdfunding ' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research			0
she is in charge of an international consortium developing the new @entity151 drugs that helped formulate the experimental @entity153 serum that used to treat two @entity97 aid workers who contracted @entity4 in @entity155 and recovered			1
dr. @entity102 posted an appeal on the @entity158 website seeking at least $ 100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever			1
the appeal has so far raised nearly $ 17,500 in donations			1
the @entity103 - led consortium was established with a $ 28 million grant from the @entity170 , but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources			0
specimens are being sent to dr. @entity102 's lab from around the world , ' but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them ' , the website said in a message			2
@entity153 is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the ebola virus , preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells			0
the compound was tested in monkeys , but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to @entity197 to treat @entity97 aid workers dr. @entity129 and @entity199 after they became infected in @entity155 in july			0
both were ultimately cured , but doctors are unsure whether the @entity153 actually helped them .			1
