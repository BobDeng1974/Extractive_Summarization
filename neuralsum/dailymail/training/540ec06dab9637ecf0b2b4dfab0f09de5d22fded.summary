by @entity1 reporter published : 09:40 est , 3 february 2014 @entity3 : 13:04 est , 3 february 2014 a @entity5 woman was horrified on friday when she discovered a 4 - inch bolt weighing several pounds had smashed straight through her dining room ceiling			1
homeowner @entity8 first believed the heavy hunk of metal was part of a burst pipe			1
but when workers came to assess the bolt , they pointed out the it probably fell from an airplane and hit the house , which sits directly in the flight path of the @entity24 area ’s busy @entity22 airport			2
big bolt : a 4 - inch , 2 - pound metal object crashed through @entity8 's @entity5 home on friday and now the @entity28 has become involved ' it could have hit my dog ' : the metal mystery object crashed through the roof and ceiling and right into @entity8 's dining room now officials are scratching their heads as they ponder what part of a plane the object comes from and whose aircraft is missing a bolt			1
@entity8 first saw the object and the fist - sized hole it left in her ceiling on friday morning when she returned home from taking her child to school			1
‘ at first , i thought maybe a gas pipe burst or something , and then i found this piece here that i thought maybe was a pipe from a gas pipe , ’ @entity8 told @entity49			1
‘ but when i had the gas company come out , they identified it as likely a piece of aircraft			0
’ with the location of @entity8 ’s beneath the constant comings and goings of countless aircraft , the assessment made sense			2
but can an aircraft function without such a large bolt ? @entity68 is falling ? @entity8 initially believed the bolt came from a burst gas line but service workers say it 's more likely from an airplane and now the @entity28 in on the case ' it could have hit the kids in the elementary school ' : as authorities investigate the incident and identify which , if any , aircraft the bolt came from , @entity8 ca n't help but ponder ' what ifs ' ‘ we have no idea if it 's an aircraft part or where it came from and we have to investigate it , ’ said @entity28 investigator @entity83 , who was on the scene saturday			1
according to @entity83 , the @entity88 was expected to send inspectors to @entity22 on monday and also analyse the mystery object			2
‘ we need to do some ground work to see if any airlines have reported any incident with one of their aircraft , ’ @entity83 said			0
meanwhile , @entity8 just ca n’t help but ponder the ‘ what ifs			0
’ ‘ had it been a little this way or a little that way it could have hit my dog			0
it could have hit the kids in the elementary school if they had been playing out over there , ’ she said			0
‘ and that 's scary to me for sure			0

@entity8 lives beneath the @entity106 in @entity5
@entity8 says she first thought the bolt was from a burst gas line but service workers said it 's from a plane
the @entity28 and @entity88 are now investigating the 2 - pound , 4 - inch bolt
