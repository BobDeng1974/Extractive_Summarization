@entity1 's spacewalking astronauts replaced a failed electrical unit at the @entity3 on wednesday , restoring full power to the orbiting lab. the space station had been operating since spring with only seven of its eight solar - power channels			1
38 , and @entity11 , 51 , — @entity1 's second spacewalk in two weeks — brought the energy capability back up to 100 percent			1
@entity1 astronauts @entity10 ( right ) and @entity11 ( left ) seen working inside the @entity3 previously on october 1 , 2014 the spacewalkers encountered balky bolts but still managed to complete the job in the allotted time , with less than two minutes to spare			1
' @entity19 ! ' they cheered as @entity1 declared victory			2
the voltage regulator shorted out in may but could not be replaced until now because of a yearlong hiatus in non-emergency spacewalks by @entity1			1
the stoppage was caused by spacesuit problems , most notably a flooded helmet that nearly cost an astronaut 's life in 2013			2
@entity1 astronauts are shown repairing a failed power regulator outside the @entity3 on wednesday @entity10 took part in the oct. 7 spacewalk that jump - started @entity1 's outside maintenance , accompanied by a @entity33			1
this time , @entity10 , of @entity34 , was joined by @entity11 , of @entity35 , who made his first spacewalk			1
to avoid an electrical shock , the two spacewalkers waited until darkness before attempting to remove the old voltage regulator , so there would be no discharge			1
they took in the view 260 miles below as they waited for the space station to fly into the night side of @entity46			1
' i see @entity48 ! ' @entity10 said			1
' ca n't quite make out the pyramids , though			0
' @entity50 came over @entity51 and @entity52 , and @entity10 began to undo the bolt holding down the bad regulator			1
his pistol grip tool failed to loosen the bolt			2
' i can feel it binding up , ' he said			0
a ratchet wrench — along with some muscle — did the trick			0
@entity1 astronaut @entity10 ( pictured here ) at the @entity3 on october 7 @entity10 removed the 330 - pound boxy regulator from its slot and , with @entity11 's help , popped in the new one			1
but once again , they ran into bolt trouble , this time in securing the new device			2
the minutes ticked away as @entity70 debated how much longer to keep up the effort , before stopping for the next orbital sunrise			0
with less than 10 minutes remaining , flight controllers advised @entity10 to try tightening the bolt with the ratchet wrench			1
' outstanding news , ' @entity70 radioed			0
flight controllers immediately checked out the newly installed system , with less than three minutes to go			0
@entity80 was declared with one minute and 45 seconds remaining			0
the voltage regulator , officially called a sequential shunt unit or @entity83 , is needed to keep excess power from its designated solar wing , from overloading the station system			2
power is regulated at about 160 volts			0
after the may breakdown , @entity1 transferred space station systems dependent on the failed power channel to a backup			2
no operations were hampered , but @entity1 wanted that channel operating again for full capability and redundancy			0
it should be back up and running normally again by thursday			0
with their main job completed , the spacewalkers installed a new camera , and moved around various camera and wireless radio systems			1
the relocations are needed to get ready for the eventual arrival of new commercial crew vehicles			0
that 's still a few years away			0
' it 's been a very successful day , ' @entity70 said as the six - and - a - half - hour spacewalk drew to a close			0
a @entity110 spacewalk , meanwhile , is on tap for next wednesday .			0
