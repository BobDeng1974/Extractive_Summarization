and now the late artist ’s estate has found an equally unorthodox way to settle his £ 10 million inheritance tax bill – by trading in parts of his art collection			0
in april , @entity11 revealed that @entity1 left £ 96 million in his will , the largest sum ever by a @entity15 artist			0
but rather than hand a large slice of it to the taxman , executors of the estate have offered to give a selection of artworks to museums in lieu of payment			1
executors are understood to have offered some of @entity1 ( left ) 's favourite works including @entity31 - @entity30 's painting @entity32 , @entity34 @entity33 to settle his tax bill works offered are understood to include examples by @entity39 sculptor @entity38 , and @entity39 artist @entity31 - @entity30 ’s painting @entity41 , @entity34 @entity33			1
@entity1 , whose sitters included the @entity43 , @entity44 and a naked @entity46 supervisor nicknamed ‘ @entity47 ’ , died in july last year			0
last month , the @entity48 in @entity49 ( @entity50 ) , which works in conditions of utter secrecy , is said to have approved the application to use artworks to settle the tax bill , deciding the items offered were of enough significance			1
its decision will have to be ratified by ministers , who will then decide which museums and galleries receive the items			1
one source in the art world said : ‘ it was not a long list of items but it included the @entity30 painting and the sculptures			1
there may have been one or two other things			0
‘ the amount to be covered is just under £ 10 million			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity74 , which runs the @entity50 panel , last night declined to confirm or deny whether @entity1 ’s estate had even made an approach to the panel			2
the @entity79 and the @entity80 both declined to comment			0
the @entity81 said : ‘ we ca n’t comment on works of art that are not part of the @entity81 collection			2
’ another source last night said that it was almost certain that the @entity30 painting would end up in the @entity79			1
in a rare interview in 2002 , @entity1 , who fathered at least 14 children , named @entity30 as one of the all - time greats of the art world alongside @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
his collection contains several works by his friend , the @entity101 - born artist @entity100			1
the @entity30 painting offered to the nation was once owned by @entity105 star @entity104 , best known for his gangster roles in films such as @entity108 and @entity109			2
@entity1 ’s will revealed that he left @entity111 , his assistant of more than 20 years , £ 2.5 million as well as his @entity114 home			0
@entity111 was unavailable for comment			0
lawyer @entity116 , an executor of the estate , who is believed to have handled negotiations with the panel , was also unavailable .			2
