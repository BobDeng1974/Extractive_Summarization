children as young as 12 are being given contraceptive implants			1
at least five @entity3 health boards have given long - term birth control to girls who are barely out of primary school			1

the drug has never been tested on children and is known to have side effects in some adults including nausea , depression , acne and headaches			1
the schoolgirls are among 3,500 minors in @entity3 to have the long - term birth control devices inserted in their arms according to the manufacturer , the drug ’s ‘ safety and efficacy in adolescents under the age of 18 has not been established ’			1
@entity33 of the @entity34 said : ‘ to provide schoolgirls with long - acting reversible contraception is to play with fire			1
‘ it is effectively giving them a licence to engage in illegal sexual activity and denies them the protection that the law on the age of consent is intended to give			2
' not only does prescribing the drugs to underage girls make it more difficult for them to resist sexual pressure from their peers , but it also makes them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation by older sexual predators			1
’ mr @entity55 added : ‘ the fact that the safety of these implants has not been established for girls under the age of 18 means health professionals are taking a massive risk with the immediate and long - term health of these youngsters			1
‘ it is deeply disturbing that parents are frequently left in the dark and know nothing about the high - stakes gamble being taken on the physical and emotional well - being of their daughters			2
’ @entity73 , editor of the @entity75 newsletter , condemned the practise , saying : ‘ this is child abuse			2
i am not a medical person but it can not possibly be helpful			0
parents need to be more vigilant – you can not trust the state with your children			2
‘ it is hypocritical of the government to say they want to protect children from abuse in the home and then at the same time they are setting them up to be abused			1
’ the plastic implants – brand name @entity92 – are fitted under the skin of the arm and last for three years , releasing progesterone to prevent pregnancy			2
in @entity3 , contraceptive implants are available from hospitals or sexual health clinics and can be inserted by a nurse or a doctor			1

between them , they admitted having given prescriptions to at least 20 12 - year - olds			0
the figures are likely to be higher , though , as five boards – including @entity132 – refused to provide full details			0
the statistics also caused concern because – at the company ’s own admission – the treatment ’s safety in under - 16s has not been established			0
in adults , side - effects are known to be common			1
@entity144 health spokesman @entity143 said : ‘ when we offer medication such as this to children , we have to be sure it is safe			2
‘ if these concerns prove to be legitimate , i hope the @entity151 will look at this as a matter of urgency			0
’ asked if the firm recommended its product for under - 16s , an @entity107 spokesman said : ‘ the choice and suitability of a contraceptive method for any individual should always be discussed with an appropriate healthcare professional			0
’ a @entity151 spokesman said : ‘ @entity132 boards and local authorities prioritise sexual health for young people and , as a result , teenage pregnancy rates have fallen for the last four years			1
‘ whilst we would encourage any young person considering contraception to discuss this with their parent , there is no legal requirement to do so			0
