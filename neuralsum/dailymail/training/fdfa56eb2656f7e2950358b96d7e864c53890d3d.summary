driving under the influence of drugs is illegal , but until now police officers have had to wait for blood tests to confirm whether a driver is high , which can take up to 24 hours			1
now , scientists have developed a cannabis - detecting breathalyser that generates results almost immediately			2
researchers at @entity11 came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect @entity13 , the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis			1
scientists have come up with a cannabis - detecting breathalyser that could be used on the roadside , and help police charge people with drug - driving offences more easily the gadget uses ion - mobility technology , which is used by airport security professionals to detect drugs and explosives , the @entity23 reported			1
the prototype device , which could be tested on humans as soon as next year , is not designed to detect how stoned a driver is , but simply to confirm whether they have @entity13 in their system			1
researchers at @entity11 came up with the handheld breathalyser to detect @entity13 ( illustarted ) , which is the psychoactive ingredient in pot , which is not found in alcohol @entity13 ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana 's psychological effects			1
it bonds to receptors on nerve cells , which respond by changing in activity			0
the cannabinoid receptors are found in areas of the brain linked to memory , cognition , pleasure , coordination and the perception of time			0
@entity13 stimulates cells in the brain to release dopamine , creating a happy feeling , but can also cause hallucinations , delusions and affect rational thinking			2
on average , the effects last for around two hours			0
the idea is , that is the chemical was detected , a driver would be given a blood test , which could then be used as evidence in court			1
taking drugs affects people 's driving skills , and can give them slower reaction times , nausea , hallucinations , panic attacks , paranoia , ' the shakes , ' dizziness , fatigue and the affects their ability to concentrate properly , which could increase their chance of having a road accident			0
@entity11 ’s research could soon help out the @entity83 , which have said that a quarter of blood samples taken from drivers in the area in the last year tested positive for cannabis			1
the state legalised cannabis two years ago and in 2013 , 1,362 drivers tested positive for having active cannabis in their system – 25 per cent more than the previous year			2
it is estimated that 720 of these people had @entity13 levels high enough to lead to an automatic drugged driving conviction under state law			2
the @entity83 says it welcomes anything that gets impaired drivers off the road			0
drug - driving affects people 's ability to drive , which can increase the change of accidents ( stock image ) it 's illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol and other drugs , including cannabis , cocaine , ecstasy and ketamine , in the @entity116			0
just one puff of cannabis puts a driver over the limit			2
the police ask drivers to do a ' field impairment assessment ' to assess their ability to drive and can then arrest anyone who they suspect of driving under the influence , before taking them to do a blood test			1
if the test comes back positive , drivers could be charged with a crime			0
penalties for drug driving include : a minimum 12 month driving ban , criminal record , a fine of up to £ 5,000 and / or six months in prison			0
taking drugs affects people 's driving skills , and can give them slower reaction times , nausea , hallucinations , panic attacks , paranoia , ' the shakes , ' dizziness , fatigue and the ability to concentrate properly .			0

@entity11 researchers *invented* the breathalyser
it detects @entity13 , which is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis
device could be used on the roadside by police , but a blood test would still be needed to determine how high a driver may be
prototype could be tested on humans in spring next year
