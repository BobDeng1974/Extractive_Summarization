@entity1 ’s financial results for the 2013 - 14 season , published on friday afternoon , reveal record levels of ‘ free ’ cash sitting in the club ’s bank account , £ 173.3m at the end of may , much of which should theoretically have been available - and be available - for @entity9 as a transfer kitty			1
the @entity11 spent around £ 78m over the summer on players including @entity13 and @entity14 although the net spend was only around £ 46m			1
even allowing for a ‘ rainy day ’ stockpile that the club ’s chief executive @entity17 , likes to keep in reserve , and even allowing for the fact that some of the cash will be spent on an increased wage bill for summer signings , @entity9 should still theoretically have up to £ 100m available to him for more players - whether in january or next summer			1
but @entity25 understands that the @entity1 manager will only have £ 30m to spend on players in the january transfer window			1
@entity1 spent heavily on the likes of @entity13 but could have used around £ 100m more this summer @entity1 's signings , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity14 and @entity13 cost £ 78m even the most conservative estimate of money available , allowing for a large reserve in case @entity1 fail to reach next season ’s @entity39 group stages , suggests @entity9 had £ 60m more at his disposal this summer than he spent			1
club sources say that @entity9 's realistic january spending would be limited to two players in the £ 10m to £ 15m price range each , with wages on top			1
further spending would be sanctioned in the summer			0
@entity1 have been linked with several holding midfielders including @entity50 and @entity51 , but price and wages were a sticking point during the summer transfer window			1
@entity9 is also thought to be interested in @entity56 goalkeeper @entity55 , who has been the subject of criticism from fans at the @entity60			2
the @entity61 , a graduate in economics who famously seeks value in the transfer market , has been notoriously reluctant to splash massive sums over the years			0
yet the revelation that there is so much money in @entity1 ’s bank account , is sure to prompt renewed debate among @entity11 supporters over why @entity9 is not spending it			1
the accounts indicate yet again what a successful club @entity1 are , financially speaking , with football club income up to £ 298.7m from £ 242.8 , driven by a leap in @entity78 tv money			1
@entity13 , signed from @entity79 , has made an impressive start , scoring three times already for @entity1 the @entity11 also purchased @entity14 from @entity82 for £ 16m on transfer deadline day operating profits are up to £ 62.1 from £ 25.2m last year			1
the club ’s total wage bill has risen by almost £ 11m from £ 154.5m to £ 166.4m but remains significantly lower than that of @entity88 and @entity82 ( both well in excess of £ 200m now ) and @entity90			2
financial analysts within the influential @entity93 ’ trust group were expecting cash reserves of around £ 140m so the £ 173.3m is a surprise - and will only increase the clamour for @entity9 to spend it			2
he ended the @entity11 ' nine - year long trophy drought by leading his team to @entity100 victory in may but @entity1 have not won the @entity78 title since 2004 and last finished as high as second in 2005			0
@entity1 ’s chairman , sir @entity103 , said : ‘ our revenues [ including property income ] have exceeded £ 300m , underpinned by tv and the significant progress made on our commercial agenda , and our improved financial position has allowed us to supplement the squad with important new signings			2
' our ambition is to put @entity1 at the pinnacle of the game here and in @entity117			0
we all want to savour a repeat of the joys of last may			0
” @entity14 is yet to score a goal for the club despite good chances against @entity123 and @entity88 @entity124 , whose recent performances have been criticised , is the club 's record signing at over £ 42m @entity17 , said : ‘ the club is in excellent shape , both on and off the pitch			2
we are proud of our 11th @entity100 success and the reward this represents to our fans in the @entity1 community around the world			0
' there is always more to do and , whether investing in the team or in training facilities which will provide long - term benefit to the club , our guiding principles are the same and our focus is clear , on delivering more on field success			0
' this remains the shared ambition of our majority shareholder @entity148 , the board and everyone connected with the club			0
' we are well placed to deliver against those ambitions			0
’ @entity32 joined @entity1 from @entity152 and the 19 - year - old is getting plenty of first team action @entity31 's injury has left @entity1 light at the back after they failed to buy enough defenders			0

@entity9 spent £ *78million* over the summer on the likes of @entity13 and @entity14
@entity1 boss could have spent £ 60m more this summer
*gunners* brought in five players but did not purchase a holding midfielder
@entity9 could use the excess money in january or next summer
