it could soon be possible to closely examine some of the coldest items in the universe ' indefinitely ' due to a breakthrough in imaging techniques			0
up until now , studying matter at temperatures close to absolute zero was difficult because the light energy from the cameras caused the matter to heat up and be destroyed			2
physicists from @entity13 have created a computer program that not only reveals for the first time exactly how this energy behaves , it helps create a way of using this energy to keep the particles cold			1
when boson particles are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a gas , known as a @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , pictured			1
for the first time , researchers have simulated how matter behaves when photographed at these temperatures and developed a way to keep it cool , making it possible to study the gas for longer @entity31 - cold @entity24 ( @entity25 ) represents a new state of matter and is one of the cornerstones of quantum physics			1
there is currently a great deal off interest in the use of @entity25 in precision measurement			1
at the moment , some of the most sensitive detectors ever made - to measure things like rotation , acceleration , and gravity - use the wavelike properties of atoms			0
scientists believe @entity50 could further improve their accuracy			0
another potential use is in quantum information processing			0
if you want to build a quantum computer , you need a way to start with matter that is in the same state , and a @entity25 could help achieve this			2
by keeping them cold , the condensates and their atomic processes can be studied for much longer			2
the process has n’t been used in a real - world experiment yet , but the scientists from @entity66 believe it could make studying the coldest of objects much easier			1
when particles called bosons are cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero they turn into a dilute gas			2
this change of state is known as a @entity24 ( @entity25 )			1
absolute zero is -273.15 @entity79 ) and at this temperature atoms behave differently			0
for decades scientists have been studying how and why they do this			0
the boson particles change into this state because the drop in temperature reduces how much energy they have			1
@entity25 ( pictured in purple ) being measured with off - resonant light ( red )			0
this imaging technique gives scientists a window to view the world 's coldest state of matter			0
the researchers have simulated how feedback , provided by the magnetic coils in green , can extend how long this window can be used to peer at the quantum object @entity104 condensates have zero viscosity and they behave like a single ‘ blob - like ’ mass. by studying these blobs , scientists can track atomic changes and processes			2
samples of @entity50 were first manually created in labs during the mid- 1990s and they are kept cool using a series of magnetic coils			2
traditional imaging techniques ca n’t be used to photograph @entity50 because the extra energy added by the light in these cameras causes the particles to heat back up again , changing the gas back into a solid and destroying the @entity25			1

more recent scientific breakthroughs involved imaging the @entity50 using a type of laser imaging called off - resonant photons			0
this laser bounces its energy off the atoms , rather than into them , to avoid heating them too much			0
however , this process only works for a short period of time before too much energy is used and the @entity50 heat up again			1
@entity160 from the @entity66 , with researchers from @entity162 , have developed a computer program that simulates this off - resonant imaging , as well as the behaviour of the @entity104 condensates to reveal exactly what happens during the process			1
they were then able to virtually filter the heating effect , and therefore the energy produced , into the magnetic coils used to keep the @entity50 cold to keep them cooler for longer and study the atomic processes for longer			1

@entity160 from the @entity66 , with researchers from @entity162 , developed the advanced computer program to simulate this off - resonant imaging , as well as the behaviour of the @entity104 condensates , to see how the gas responds to the laser energy			1
the results revealed exactly what happens during the process , for the first time ever , and the physicists could see the spread of energy and the change of state in action			0
by studying @entity50 , scientists can track atomic processes			1
samples of @entity50 were created in labs , using apparatus pictured , during the 1990s			0

instead of heating up the particles , this method meant the energy could be used to keep them cooler for longer , letting scientists study atomic processes for longer			2
the results are published in the @entity220 .			0

when boson particles are cooled to almost absolute zero they form a gas
this change of state is known as a @entity24 ( @entity25 )
traditional imaging processes causes @entity50 to heat up - destroying the gas
researchers from @entity66 have created a computer program that shows what happens during this imaging process
they then trapped energy that heats them up and used it to keep them cool
this makes studying the gas - and its atomic processes - much easier
becs could help advance quantum computing and precision measurement
