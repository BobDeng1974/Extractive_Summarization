by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 31 january 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 1 february 2013 for most 21 - year - old women , a trip to a spa or the theatre are a nice way to spend a weekend			2
but for @entity7 these are her precious dying wishes			1
the student , from @entity9 , @entity10 , has been bravely battling cancer since she was 17 years old but learned on @entity12 this year that her condition is now terminal			1
so she decided to draw up a list of things she would like to do in her final months			2
scroll down to hear from @entity17 brave battle : @entity7 , pictured left before she was diagnosed with a rare cancer , and pictured right today @entity7 , pictured in hospital , has refused to give up fighting her cancer and plans to set up a local charity to help other teenagers with cancer unusual requests include learning how to de-cork a bottle with a sword and to hold her own fake wedding			1
' she has always wanted to get married and have lots of babies but has found it hard to have a partner while undergoing treatment , despite being a very pretty girl , ' her sister said			0
' she wants to at least have tried on dresses and had a hen do before she goes			2
it does n't matter that it 's not for real			0
' we 're planning to go all out for the hen do			2
the local landlady and our friends have been talking about naked butlers or maybe even a stripper - if @entity17 allows it			1
' @entity17 was too young to come to mine and was having treatment when our older sister got married			0
' but many of her requests are modest ones - she would like to finish her course and qualify as a nursery nurse and watch a sunset in a beautiful place			2
@entity7 ( right ) is pictured enjoying a night out with friends before her treatment			1
she lost her hair following chemotherapy she would love to go on holiday with her family and dogs , to the seaside with her nieces and nephews and to enjoy a ' normal ' drunken night in the pub. perhaps more poignantly many of her wishes are for others			1
she wants to arrange for her sister to meet @entity73 or @entity74 and take her father to meet the @entity77 squad			0
another wish is simply ' to make someone 's cancer experience slightly happier to get through			2
' her sister @entity81 , 31 , said : ' @entity17 is such a selfless person			0
for her it 's more about memories for us as well as fun experiences for herself			0
' she wants us to have good memories of her rather than all the hospital memories			0
' miss @entity7 was diagnosed with @entity90 in 2009 after doctors found a tumour the size of a tennis ball in the back of her pelvis			1
by the time treatment started it had grown to cover the whole right side of her pelvis			0
she responded well to 10 rounds of chemotherapy and three lots of radiotherapy in the first year and went into remission in october 2010			0
she returned to college to complete her second year of her child education course and started working in a local nursery			0
@entity7 is determined to enjoy her life despite often being in agonising pain due to the cancer			1
a common side - effect of treatment is weight gain @entity7 has achieved one dream already of meeting @entity115 and @entity116 from @entity118 's @entity117 but just as @entity7 and her family were hoping she had turned the corner , they discovered the soft - tissue cancer has returned			1
she started chemotherapy again in april 2012 but this time it failed to work			0
in october last year she had her right leg and part of her pelvis removed but after the surgery doctors found the cancer has returned to her stump			0
two previously benign tumours in her lungs had also grown nearly an inch each			0
on @entity12 doctors told her and her family they would not be able to save her life and could only now try to prolong it as much as possible			1
@entity81 said : ' @entity12 was awful			1
the doctors said @entity17 would never be free of the cancer , but they would manage it as best they could			0
' they told us the cancer had returned to her amputated stump and chest and lung area			2
' then 10 days later a consultant confirmed the cancer was terminal but they would do what they could to keep her with us for as long as possible			2
' stephanie with a new relation : she was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 17 @entity7 lost her leg to cancer in october last year ( right )			1
but after the surgery they found the cancer had returned to her stump @entity160 ' one day never seems to come otherwise '			2
@entity17 explains her bucket list plans @entity7 has had another round of chemotherapy and is due to have two more in the next three months in an attempt to prolong her life			1
she was given a nerve blocking treatment this week , which has taken away the pain from her stump and will hopefully enable her to attempt some of her bucket list wishes			1
she was inspired to draw up the bucket list by friends at the @entity172 at @entity173 , @entity174			1
@entity81 , who is a mother - of - three , said : ' she has spent so much time in hospital and she feels that she has wasted it			0
she is determined not to waste any more time			0
' @entity17 would love to to meet @entity73 or @entity74 and wants her sister to share the treat @entity7 also plans to set up a local charity named @entity17 's wishes to help teenagers suffering from cancer by providing essential equipment for rehabilitation			1
she has already helped to raise more than Â£ 40,000 for the @entity172 since 2009 - the charity which funded @entity187 at @entity173			0
@entity81 said : ' we are determined to fight it for as long as we can and to help her do all the things she wants to do			0
' please email any offers to help with @entity17 's bucket list to @entity193			1

@entity7 was diagnosed with a rare cancer when she was just 17
