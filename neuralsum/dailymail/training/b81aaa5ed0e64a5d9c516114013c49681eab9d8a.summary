@entity6 finance secretary @entity48 said that @entity6 could have performed better if it had been independent since the 1970s deputy pm @entity49 said the report proved that independence would ‘ condemn @entity6 to a long period of non-stop austerity and spending cuts ’			1
‘ i do n’t think the break - up of @entity20 is inevitable , ’ the @entity56 leader said			0
chief secretary to the treasury @entity58 , a @entity6 mp , added : ‘ even on the most optimistic scenario , an independent @entity6 would require cuts almost two and a half times as deep than if they stayed in the @entity20			2
