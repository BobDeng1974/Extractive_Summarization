she falls asleep suddenly up to six times a day often collapses in the street waking from her sleep - walking state , @entity0 was horrified to discover she had punched her husband in the face , breaking his nose			1
but the mother - of - two 's outburst was not intentional or malicious			1
the 33 - year - old is a diagnosed narcoleptic , and falls asleep without warning up to six times a day			1
she has woken to find she has sprayed mr @entity13 cleaning products on vegetables while cooking dinner and has come round to find she 's made herself a sandwich			2
but for mrs @entity0 , who also suffers the related sleep disorder cataplexy , her illness has a serious side			1
cataplexy causes a sufferer 's muscles to completely relax , rendering a person unable to move , while remaining fully conscious			1
and twice while lying paralysed and helpless in a cataleptic state the street , she has been targeted by heartless thieves			1
although she could n't move , the 33 - year - old felt hands raiding her pockets , removing her bank cards and mobile phone , while they pretended to help her			1
the conditions leave her prone to acting out her dreams as she sleep walks around the family 's home in @entity37 , @entity38			1
the bath has been removed , to prevent mrs @entity0 falling asleep in it , and she has stopped using a kettle			1
she said her ' life - changing ' sleep episodes are often triggered by laughing or crying			1
she no longer goes out alone and never carries more than a few pounds in cash in her bag			0
she said : ' it 's changed my life completely			2
' on a couple of occasions i 've been robbed			2
remember , i ca n't move but i am still aware so i can feel their hands going into my pockets			0
' it happened in @entity54 in about 2008 and then in @entity55 three years ago			0
' it was people pretending to help me but really they took my bank cards and phone out of my pockets			0
' i knew what was happening but could n't do anything as the more stressed i got the worse the cataplexy got			2
' i do not go out alone now			0
' @entity63 , which affects about 30,000 people in the @entity65 , can cause excessive sleepiness and affects the brain 's ability to regulate the normal sleep - wake cycle			1
cataplexy is a co-existing condition which brings on episodes of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter , anger and surprise			1
in mrs @entity0 ' case it causes her to regularly collapse , often after she has been laughing or crying			1

she said : ' it can be quite dangerous ' @entity63 is a condition that affects around 0.05 per cent of a population			0
in the @entity65 that equates to around 31,000 sufferers			0
it is a rare sleep disorder , which affects the brain 's ability to regulate the normal sleep - wake cycle			1
it can cause symptoms including a disturbed night 's sleep as well as excessive tiredness during the day			1
normal sleep falls into a regular pattern of @entity113 ( rapid eye movement ) and non-rem stages			1
every 90 minutes or so , a normal sleeper experiences several minutes of @entity113 sleep , where dreaming occurs			2
they then switch back to non-rem sleep			2
but , for narcoleptics , their sleep pattern is much more fragmented			2
this causes them to wake up regularly			0
in addition , @entity113 sleep can come on very quickly during the day and night , producing dream - like hallucinations			1
cataplexy is an episode of muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter , anger and surprise			1
the loss of muscle tone ranges from a just - perceptible weakening of the facial muscles through weakness at the knees , to total collapse on the floor			2
speech is slurred , eyesight impaired ( double vision , inability to focus ) but hearing and awareness remain undisturbed			0
attacks often last less than two minutes , and they may only last a few seconds			0
some people have repeated attacks of cataplexy which persist for up to 30 minutes			2
during both mild and severe attacks , the person stays fully conscious			0
cataplexy may be most severe when the subject is tired rather than fully alert and can lead to considerable anxiety although anxiety itself is not a trigger			2
it is thought that about 75 per cent of patients with narcolepsy have cataplexy			1

i 'll fall into automatic behaviour			0
' my brain will cycle in and out of a sleep state and my body will carry on going , so i 'll wake up to find i 've made a sandwich			1
' i have no fine motor skills though so i 'll have put about a pound of butter and a whole chunk of cheese on a slice of bread			0
' it can be quite dangerous too - i once sprayed our vegetables for dinner with mr @entity13 instead of @entity187 oil , but my husband noticed in time			1
' the 33 - year - old was formally diagnosed in 2009 , but suspects her condition dates back longer than that			1
' when i was a teenager i 'd start sleeping between lessons and my friends would wake me up on a rota , ' she said			0
' i just thought i was tired but looking back i realise that was part of it			0
' i 'm basically the text - book worst - case scenario			2
i had to do away with the bath because i 'd sink down and i could feel myself start to drown but i could n't do anything about it			0
' my husband used to have to be in the bathroom to keep an eye on me			0
' mrs @entity0 hopes her story will help raise awareness of the conditions she lives with			1
' you either curl up and feel sorry for yourself or get on with it , ' she added			0
' my cataplexic episodes are triggered by strong emotion			2
' i can have a fall if i start crying or fall if i laugh			0
my little boy calls it a ' splat '			0
' during milder episodes my speech will slur			0
' when i had my little boy in january 2007 , during the pregnancy i fell down a lot			0
' i lived in a maisonette with two sets of stairs and every check up i 'd come in with a bruised hand , a bruised head or another bump			0
' after visiting a number of different specialists and doctors , some of whom mistook her condition for fatigue and depression , mrs @entity0 finally recognised her condition as being narcolepsy when she was watching a documentary			1
