banks in an independent @entity1 would be at risk of an @entity4 - style meltdown which saw savers lose billions , a leading ratings agency has warned			1
@entity7 ’s sounded the alarm after figures showed the assets of @entity1 lenders would be more than 10 times bigger than the entire country ’s economy			1
it would leave the government unable to guarantee savings in the event of a collapse , echoing the crisis which engulfed @entity4 in 2008 when all of its banks were allowed to fail			1
the assets of banks in an independent @entity1 would outstrip the entire economy by more than the peak in @entity4 , where banks failed in 2008 it is the latest major warning about the financial uncertainties facing @entity1 if voters decide to back independence in september ’s referendum			1
first minister @entity32 has repeatedly claimed @entity1 has the economic muscle to go it alone			2
before the financial crash he used to point to @entity4 as part of an ‘ arc of posterity ’ which showed small economies could thrive			1
but in 2008 , @entity4 ’s banks crashed			1
with assets totalling 880 per cent of @entity43 , the government of the small country was unable to bail them out and billions were lost			1
some 340,000 savers lost deposits when @entity48 collapsed , 200,000 of which were @entity50			1
@entity32 has unveiled proposals for high - speed cross-border trains from an independent @entity1 in a @entity54 pitch to @entity56 voters			2
in a brazen attempt to convince business leaders in northern @entity56 to back the break - up of @entity50 , he said a ' feasibility study ' will be launched in an effort to slash journey times to @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
marking @entity56 's national day at an event in @entity68 , mr @entity32 said @entity69 plans for high - speed rail - known as @entity71 - will take ' decades to spread up from the @entity72 '			2
the @entity73 has already announced proposals to include @entity75 and @entity76 in a third phase of the @entity71 network			0
however , if @entity1 becomes an independent country , @entity80 sources have warned there would be no economic case for building north of @entity65 and @entity64 because there are no major population centres on their side of the @entity88			0
the first minister said joint plans for a high - speed rail link were already being discussed with @entity69			0
but he added : ' an independent @entity1 could do more			0
rather paying our share of the borrowing costs for high - speed rail , as we wait decades for it to spread up from the south , we can use that money to build high - speed rail from the north instead			0
' governments in @entity50 and the @entity102 were forced to repay £ 3.18 billion to members of the public who lost their deposits when @entity48 , an online subsidiary of @entity4 's @entity107 , collapsed in the 2008 crisis			1
according to latest estimates , banks in an independence @entity1 would have assets worth 1,200 per cent of gdp			2
as a result , an independent @entity1 would be unable to guaranatee the savings held in banks which went to the wall , @entity7 ’s said			1
‘ in our view , the willingness and ability of a future @entity1 government to support its banking system is challenging at this point , not least because system assets could be over 1,000 per cent of @entity1 gdp			0
a new banking market would mean additional costs and risks			0
’ even joining the @entity128 – as mr @entity32 hopes to do - would not be enough to protect the banks ’ assets			2
‘ these arrangements would likely be unfunded , leaving the comparatively very sizeable deposit bases of the largest @entity1 banks backed with an implicit guarantee by the @entity1 government , ’ @entity7 said			1
‘ we note a possible parallel here with @entity4 , where in 2008 the national deposit insurance scheme could not honour claims when the country 's outsized banking system failed			1
’ it also warned that a separate @entity1 banking market would create additional costs for banks on both sides of the border			2
the @entity148 wants to share the pound in a formal currency union with the @entity151 , but all major @entity50 parties have pointedly ruled this out			0
the absence of an effective deposit guarantee scheme could see a flight of @entity1 's banks across the border , it said			1
a spokesman for @entity162 campaign better together said : ‘ @entity1 savings and mortgages are more secure as part of the @entity50			2
’ but a @entity148 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 has all the attributes needed to be an economically successful independent country			0
’ meanwhile , a separate survey found @entity1 businesses will lose a third of @entity56 customers if mr @entity32 ’s bid to break up @entity50 succeeds			0
an @entity175 poll found 36 per cent would be less likely to deal with companies north of the @entity88 following a @entity178 vote			0
some 340,000 savers lost deposits when @entity48 collapsed , 200,000 of which were @entity50 the survey of 2,000 consumers in @entity1 , @entity56 and @entity184 asked specifically about companies such as @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
@entity189 of @entity175 said : ‘ some of these brands are old and keeping “ @entity1 ” in their names is perceived to be a strength , but this research suggests that in the event of a @entity178 vote , consumers in the rest of the @entity50 would be less likely to deal with them			0
’ @entity199 of @entity200 @entity1 said that after a @entity178 vote , @entity1 would become a ‘ foreign country ’ to consumers south of the @entity88 .			0
