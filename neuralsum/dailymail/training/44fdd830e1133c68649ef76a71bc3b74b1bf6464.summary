by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 has revealed he never feared @entity4 would beat his side to the @entity7 title last season			1
ahead of monday night ’s clash at @entity10 the @entity11 hinted @entity13 ’ team struggled to handle the pressure as the finishing line moved into sight in may			1
a costly slip from captain @entity29 contributed to a home defeat by @entity31 and one week later they threw away a three - goal advantage at @entity33 to draw 3 - 3 with @entity34			0
@entity3 , by contrast , won their final five matches to overcome their @entity38 rivals and lift the @entity7 trophy			1
‘ i was not surprised , ’ @entity2 admitted			2
‘ i was absolutely convinced when i said the words that i said , “ careful it ’s not finished because they have to play four games more and the pressure when you are at the top of the table is increasing after every game ”			0
training days : @entity3 prepare for monday night 's match with @entity4 at the @entity10 raring to go : @entity50 has been declared fit to play his part against @entity4 ‘ the most important thing for us was not to think about @entity4 but think about what we had to do			1
from my experience , when you are finishing the season the pressure increases every week for every team , not only for @entity4			2
‘ that ’s why i was absolutely sure they were n’t going to win the five games they had to play			0
’ @entity2 , who described monday ’s clash as a ‘ game of six points ’ , believes @entity4 will be a rather different proposition without @entity68			1
he said : ‘ it is so difficult to answer after just one game but maybe they will always miss @entity68			2
he is a very important player but they have brought a lot of important new players and they continue to have a very strong squad			0
’ @entity2 is considering handing @entity76 a first start of the season after his goalscoring impact from the bench in the 2 - 0 win at @entity82 last weekend			1
@entity84 forward @entity83 is expected to lead the line against @entity4 days after penning a new deal but £ 32million signing @entity87 is not ready to feature after joining the club from @entity89 last week			0
big time : @entity91 ( left ) and @entity92 ( centre ) will hope to be involved replay : @entity2 's press conference as it happened			0
