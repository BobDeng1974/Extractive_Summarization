by @entity0 @entity2 ’s top human exploration chief has revealed to a @entity4 panel plans for a manned mission @entity6 in the 2030s are on track			1
development of key components of the deep - space rocket , capsule and infrastructure needed to reach @entity6 are already underway - and today @entity2 was given the go - ahead for a mission to land on an asteroid as part of a ' stepping stone ' to @entity6			1
a @entity20 subcommittee approved an authorization bill that would allow @entity2 to redirect an asteroid into the moon ’s orbit , land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to @entity6			1
@entity2 administrator @entity31 told members of a @entity33 that the agency remains on target to send a man to @entity6 in the 2030s there will be two versions of the @entity40 rocket			1
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity40 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload			0
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			0
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			0
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			0
the agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration ' roadmap ' to @entity6 that @entity2 will have to submit to @entity60			1
the approval came as associate @entity2 administrator @entity31 told members of a @entity33 that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) rocket and @entity68 multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to @entity6			1
avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed this week at @entity72 in preparation for a test of the @entity40 rocket later this year , and acoustic testing is also underway			2
' there is real hardware in manufacture for the path to @entity6 , ' @entity31 told senators			2
' our architecture is designed for long - term human exploration of our solar system , including the goal of human missions to @entity6			1
' the hearing , called ' from here to @entity6 , ' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long - duration space travel			1
' with the technologies and techniques we develop , we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations , ultimately allowing us to pioneer @entity6 and other destinations as we lay the groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system , ' @entity31 said			2
@entity2 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			0
they would then tow or push it towards @entity102 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity68 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			1
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity6			1
exact details on how @entity2 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			0
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity68			1
after the @entity68 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			2
once the @entity68 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
after the mission is complete , @entity68 returns to @entity102 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity149 – 10 days later , as seen in the video			0
one planned mission is to a near - @entity102 asteroid , @entity31 said			2
' @entity2 will employ @entity40 and @entity68 for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the @entity102 than ever before , rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the @entity158 by the robotic segment of the @entity160 ( @entity160 ) , ' he explained			2
' we 're going to grab a piece of the solar system , we 're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit , " he said			0
' to think we 're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system , that 's a pretty awe - inspiring statement			0
' however , the ambitious @entity6 mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget - conscious @entity60 continues to erode , or if other countries ’ plans for a lunar mission force the @entity184 to change course for security reasons			1
how it compares : the @entity40 system is larger than the @entity190 rockets than launched man to the moon in its final configuration			0

deep space rocket already being built
small missions would lead to first manned mission to @entity6 in 2030s
asteroid will be used as a base to send astronauts to @entity6
