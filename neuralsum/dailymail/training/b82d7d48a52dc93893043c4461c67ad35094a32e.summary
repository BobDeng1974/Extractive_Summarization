a doll with no facial features has been launched for @entity3 children in line with @entity6 rules about avoiding the depiction of faces			1
the featureless toy comes dressed in a hijab and red dress but has no eyes , nose or mouth			1
it has been designed to comply with strict @entity3 teachings which rule against the representation of humans and animals in other forms , and specifically @entity3 gods and their companions			1
an ' @entity6 doll ' with no facial features at all is being sold for £ 25 in line with @entity3 rules which teach that items which represent features of living things , humans or animals , should not be produced and owned however critics have dismissed the doll as ' foolish ' and say it represents antiquated views of @entity6 teachings and fails to acknowledge that @entity3 's are part of modern culture			1
the doll , which comes in just one design , is called @entity39 and named after the female companion of the @entity41			1
it is aimed at children living in strict @entity3 families			1
' there is an @entity6 ruling which forbids the depiction of facial features of any kind and that includes pictures , sculptures and , in this case , dolls , ' the designer , who is known as @entity56 , told the @entity57			1
' i spoke to a religious scholar in @entity60 who guided me through what was and what was not permissible when producing the product			0
' the @entity64 has no face on it whatsoever and is @entity68 compliant			0
' a lot of @entity6 art , like this @entity72 ivory and turquoise - inlaid box , has geometric patterns rather than faces the former teacher , who used to work at a @entity3 school in @entity78 , said she came up with the idea to design the doll after speaking to parents who were concerned about toys with facial features			1
she said it took four years to design and added : ' the @entity6 range in kids toys is quite limited at the moment with few choices			1
although this project took a while , i am looking at researching other ideas in the future			0
' i am looking at compiling a book for the @entity6 upbringing of children in the future too			2
' however professor @entity96 , a specialist in @entity3 societies and politics at @entity99 , said : ' this is silliness and foolishness			2
' @entity3 are now part of a global community			2
' in early @entity6 history imagery was not preferred for a variety of reasons			2
but the debate is , how far do you go now ? @entity6 teaches aniconism - the practice of avoiding creating images of living things			1
the most absolute prohibition is images of @entity114 , followed by @entity6 prophets and then relatives of @entity41			0
however this teaching is extended to humans in the hadith , which is open to interprettion			0
this has led to @entity6 art being represented in geometric patterns and calligraphy			0
the @entity124 does n't specifically prohibit depictions of humans , but it does rule against idolatry - the worship of an idol or physical object as a symbol of @entity114			0
@entity133 authorities interpret the hadith as prohibiting any representations of living things while others have a less strict approach that takes into account the variety of images available and used today			1
' the overwhelming majority of @entity3 are living 21st century lifestyles , things have not been frozen from the 6th century			1
' there are some people who would like us to think @entity3 history is frozen in time and space but it has evolved			1
young @entity3 are now globalised			2
' the doll is a gimmick , an ultra-conservative interpretation			0
it is a very isolated phenomenon and with all due respect i imagine it would only appeal to a very tiny group			0
' it 's a cultural luxury and i do n't think it will have much of an audience or many clients			0
' @entity164 is taught in @entity6 , which rules against the creation of living beings			0
however interpretations of the teachings have evolved over time as more imagery is used in modern society , for example on television and in adverts			0
today the avoidance of idolatry is the main concern for devout @entity3			2
it is hoped the doll will be able to be used by @entity3 children who often face having to have their toys removed at night because teachings forbid anything with eyes being left in the room			1
the doll is being sold for £ 25 and although it is not the first of its kind in the world , it is thought to be the only one produced to such a high quality			1
only a limited number have been made but @entity192 said she has already had orders			0
it has been named after one of the female companions of @entity41 , who are known by the collective name @entity198			0
the prophet had hundreds of companions who knew @entity41 and recited hadith , which were the basis of developing the @entity6 tradition			0
companions are loosely defined as anyone who saw the prophet muhammad and died a @entity3			2
the idea of creating dolls for children to play with and learn from is based on stories that @entity41 's wife , @entity210 , also played with the featureless items .			0

@entity214 doll with no eyes , nose or lips produced for @entity3 children
it complies with @entity3 teachings that living things should not be created
doll took 4 years to design and is aimed at children in strict @entity3 homes
has been designed by @entity56 , a former @entity78 school teacher
' @entity230 doll ' is being sold for £ 25 and is *marketed* as ' @entity231 '
but *academic* said it was ' foolish ' as @entity3 are not ' frozen ' in history
