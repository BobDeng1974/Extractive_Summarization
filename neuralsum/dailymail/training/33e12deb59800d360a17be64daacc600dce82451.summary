@entity9 is accused of stabbing her in the head with a pen , forcing her to the ground and raping her			1
the teacher told investigators that she screamed for help , but none came			1
afterward , @entity9 tried to use her radio to call for help			1
it had apparently been changed to a channel the unit 's guards did n't use , so @entity9 let the woman use a phone , according to the reports			1
the @entity59 issued only a bare - bones press release after the attack , but the @entity62 pieced together what happened based on interviews and investigatory reports obtained under the @entity66			2
@entity67 , a former deputy warden at the prison , said the assault highlights chronic understaffing and lax security policies that put staff members at risk			2
" here you 've got a guy that commits a hell of a crime ... and he 's put into an environment that actually gives him an opportunity to do his criminality because of a lack of staffing , " said @entity67 , who was deputy warden at the @entity16 prison in @entity75 until retiring in 2010 and oversaw the @entity76 for 19 months			1
@entity9 is shown shortly after he is accused of attacking the teacher			1
he was in the first year of a 30 - year sentence for raping a @entity90 woman in november 2011 state prison officials , however , dismiss the concerns			1
they say the assault at the prison about 60 miles southeast of @entity95 is a risk that comes with the job of overseeing violent prison inmates			2
@entity9 was in the first year of a 30 - year sentence for raping a @entity90 woman in november 2011			1
just 17 at the time , he had knocked on the woman 's door in the middle of the day , asked for a drink of water , then forced his way inside , where he repeatedly raped and beat her while her 2 - year - old child was in the apartment			1
he fled naked when the woman 's roommate arrived home			2
he was arrested after dna evidence connected him to the crime , and he pleaded guilty			0
@entity9 was initially classified as a " @entity115 " security risk , one notch lower than the highest level			2
six months later , despite violating prison rules at least once , he was reclassified at a lower level			2
@entity59 spokesman @entity121 said classrooms at prisons across the state are having cameras installed			0
but he said no administrative investigation was launched because there was no need , and no one was disciplined			0
he said all prisons are dangerous places and staff are trained accordingly			0
" this is an assault that reflects the fact that inmates in our system often act out violently , and it is the inmate suspect who is responsible for this despicable act , " he said			0
the attack took place at the @entity16 prison 's @entity14 in @entity2 ( pictured ) @entity121 also said that not having a guard in classrooms or nearby " follows accepted corrections practices nationwide			1
" that 's not the case , said @entity149 , a professor at @entity150 , @entity150 , who started her career as a prison teacher in several states and now is director of the university 's @entity156 and @entity155			1
" i have to say , i do n't find that consistent with standards , " @entity149 said			0
" in a sex offender unit , especially , they should be counting the people leaving the classroom			0
and there should be somebody , not in the class ... but there should be somebody in proximity so they can help monitor that			0
" the woman , who was not critically injured , has filed a worker 's compensation claim against the state and did not want to comment on case			2
@entity178 emails obtained by the @entity62 show that prisons director @entity179 ordered all non-corrections officer staff at prisons statewide to be issued pepper spray and trained in its use just days after the attack			2
and an internal memo sent the day after the assault ordered guards at a nearby prison to begin checking on civilian staff every hour			0
@entity121 said the pepper - spray order was in the works before the assault			0
and he said that , despite the internal memo from a major that ordered hourly checks , the actual practice is unpredictable and more frequent , with staggered checks three times an hour			0
@entity67 , who is an advocate for prison safety and believes understaffing has put state prison staff at risk , said multiple errors likely led to the assault , including not having video cameras in the classroom , a lack of checks on civilian staff and use of an outdated classification system for inmates that led to a violent predator being misidentified as a relatively low - level threat			0
after the attack , @entity9 was calm when confronted in the classroom , refused to talk to investigators and asked for a lawyer			1
he was charged last month with sexual assault , kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon			0
a public defender was appointed , and he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment			0
the public defender assigned to his case , @entity226 , declined to comment			0
@entity9 was convicted in a prison administrative hearing of sexually assaulting the staff member			1
three weeks after the rape , he assaulted another prison employee , although records do n't show any details			0
his security classification was raised two levels , to the highest , nearly three months after the teacher was assaulted .			0
