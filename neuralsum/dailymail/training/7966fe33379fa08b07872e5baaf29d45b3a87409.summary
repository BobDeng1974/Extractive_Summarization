updated : 09:46 est , 7 december 2011 the storm around the ' @entity2 ' software used in @entity4 mobile phones has led @entity5 to question the company , lawsuits , and questions over how many handsets carry the monitoring software - and what exactly it does spyware researcher @entity12 showed off a video this week demonstrating that ' @entity2 ' - software buried deep within the operating systems of @entity4 mobiles to provide mobile carriers with information - might be snooping a little more than it should			1
@entity12 's demonstration showed the software ' reading ' the contents of text messages and web browsing on an @entity27 @entity26 phone , and transmitting the information			0
since then , handset makers such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 have rushed to distance themselves from the software - portraying the ' spyware ' as an @entity26 - only problem			1
@entity12 's demo used an @entity27 phone ( pictured )			0
since then , @entity4 senator @entity38 has asked the software company to respond to @entity12 's claim - and an @entity42 resident has filed a lawsuit against the company			1
@entity42 @entity45 filed a lawsuit against @entity2 and handset maker @entity27 - which @entity12 used for his demonstration - alleging illegal interception of information			1
@entity12 's demo showed that the software , which is supposed to provide mobile phone networks with information on how handsets are used , ' read ' and transmitted the contents of @entity56 messages , and also monitored web browsing			2
@entity2 - whose software is used on millions of handsets across the @entity4 - released a statement			1
' while a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the @entity2 software inside the handset , our software does not record , store or transmit the contents of sms messages , email , photographs , audio or video , ' the company said			1
' for example , we understand whether an sms was sent accurately , but do not record or transmit the content of the sms			0
we know which applications are draining your battery , but do not capture the screen			0
' it 's still unclear whether the application does ' log ' keystrokes - or , if so , how this data is used			0
handset makers rushed to distance themselves from the software , which is installed by phone networks to monitor usage			2
@entity30 @entity30 does not install , nor authorize , its carrier partners to install “ @entity2 ” monitoring software on its blackberry smartphones , the company said on thursday			1
@entity30 made the statement after a security researcher said the ' @entity2 ' application , which can monitor what device users are doing , has been installed on mobile devices from multiple vendors without the knowledge or consent of customers			0
@entity12 , the researcher who demonstrated in online videos how the software works , focused on devices using @entity110 ’s @entity109 , but he also mentioned other operating systems , including @entity30 ’s @entity112 and @entity31 ’s @entity114 system as having the software installed			1
@entity31 also denied their phones used the software			2
handset makers such as @entity31 , makers of the @entity119 ( pictured ) , said that @entity2 software was not installed on their handsets ' @entity2 does not ship products for any @entity31 devices , ' a company spokesman said			1
@entity4 senator @entity38 asked software maker @entity2 to respond to claims by an independent security researcher that its products collect and transmit potentially sensitive data about millions of mobile phone users			1
the video shows a piece of software tracking @entity12 as he turns his phone on and off , punches numbers to make a call and records text message in plain text			0
' the revelation that the locations and other sensitive data of millions of @entity4 are being secretly recorded and possibly transmitted is deeply troubling , ' @entity38 said in a statement			1
' @entity2 has a lot of questions to answer			0
' in his letter , he asked the company for details on the types of data its software collects and what it does with that information			2
@entity154 and @entity155 both said they use the software in their devices to collect information that helps them improve network and service performance			0
' we do use carrier iq , but we do not and can not look at the contents of messages , etc. , as some have speculated , ” said @entity155 spokeswoman @entity167			0
@entity32 said that some devices , including iphones , that run on its @entity171 operating system use the @entity2 software , but that it does not work with the newer @entity173			1
in a statement posted to its website last month , @entity2 said its software is used by network operators to help improve network quality and troubleshoot device problems			2
“ while we look at many aspects of a device ’s performance , we are counting and summarizing performance , not recording keystrokes , or providing tracking tools , ” the @entity180 , @entity181 - based company said			0
since @entity12 ’s videos first appeared , a firestorm of criticism has erupted in online forums and on @entity192 , where users complain about breach of privacy			0
@entity2 immediately tried to suppress @entity12 's report			0
the @entity197 , an activist group which promotes free speech online , said , ' @entity2 fired off a cease - and - desist letter to @entity12 , claiming that he infringed its copyrights and made unspecified false allegations about its software .			2
