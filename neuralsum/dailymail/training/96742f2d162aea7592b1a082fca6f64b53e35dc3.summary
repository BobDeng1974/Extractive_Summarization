beginning in a tunnel , the video describes @entity3 as ' well away from the tourist track , ' before adding ' access is via a network of illegal tunnels '			2
' the locals like it so much they never leave , ' it says , continuing ' because they 're not allowed to '			0
viewers are privy to a selection of haunting images from children playing among tumble - down buildings to the severe bomb damage in the region , the result of a 50 - day conflict which left 3,000 injured and over 500 @entity12 children dead			1
a girl stands infront of a mural of a kitten , by @entity0 , on a housedestroyed by @entity45 shelling , in @entity46 a mural in @entity48 , northern @entity3 , shows children swinging from a surveillance tower the anonymous graffiti artist also created some of his trademark spray painted artwork among the rubble the video also desribes @entity3 as nestling ' in an exclusive setting ( surrounded by a wall on three sides and a line of gun boats on the other ) , watched over by friendly neighbours ( in 2014 @entity63 destroyed 18,000 homes )			1
' and as footage from a drone strike is shown , subtitles read : ' development opportunities are everywhere			0

what about our children ? satirical : the artist 's shocking short film takes the format of a typical travel promotion as usual with @entity0 's thought - provoking work the short video has a strong political message the short film closes with a handpainted message , scrawled on a wall in red paint : ' if we wash our hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless we side with the powerful - we do n't remain neutral			1
' the @entity124 artist 's true identity remains a closely guarded secret			1
it 's thought that his refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism			0
