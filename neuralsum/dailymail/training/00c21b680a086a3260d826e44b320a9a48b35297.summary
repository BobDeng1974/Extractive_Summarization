face of fury : there is said to have been a ' furious eruption ' from @entity2 's camp following @entity4 's supposed backing of @entity6 for leader the chancellor ’s supporters in @entity33 believe his chances of becoming @entity8 leader - largely written off a year ago - are increasing as the economy recovers and his reputation is enhanced			1
mr @entity4 has repeatedly insisted that he will not stand for the job and is said to have ‘ hitched his star ’ to that of mr @entity6			1
mr @entity13 is said to have decided that the @entity19 should be deployed to ‘ keep @entity2 in his box ’			2
one minister familiar with the strategy said : ‘ @entity4 is licensed to sink his teeth into @entity2 ’ ankles in a way that neither the boss nor @entity6 can			1
’ mr @entity4 is said to have taken to his role as ‘ licensed bear - baiter ’ with ‘ gusto ’			2
bosom buddies : education secretary @entity4 ( left ) allegedly spoke in favour of chancellor of the exchequer @entity6 ( right ) as the next @entity8 leader he and mr @entity2 had clashed over education policy , with the education secretary refusing to agree to the mayor ’s demands for more power over @entity11 schools			1
