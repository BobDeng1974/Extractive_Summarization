others , in letters of complaint to police forces and local authorities , accused politicians of ' fly - posting ' , while detectives were called when scraps broke out over conflicting ' political views '			1
the details , released to the @entity31 under the @entity32 , refer to the parliamentary by - elections in @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , and @entity40			1
one eagle - eyed viewer watching the live coverage of the @entity38 and @entity39 by - election , won by @entity46 's @entity45 defector @entity44 , was perturbed to see a person ' moving about among the tables and taking items ' - something the viewer deemed ' suspicious ' , so reported it to @entity53			1
the same by - election saw six complaints made to @entity56 , one of which was about the apparent unsuitability of a candidate , as well as the length of time it took to count the votes and announce the result			2
according to @entity67 ( @entity67 ) - whose force area included both the @entity40 and @entity70 and @entity35 and @entity36 constituencies - one party organiser found their car was damaged while out delivering leaflets			1
in another case , a campaigner was attacked by members of the @entity79 far - right group following a political discussion which escalated to violence			2
@entity46 activists in @entity37 drew a couple of complaints for fixing party posters to street furniture			1
the @entity88 party later came second to the conservative candidate @entity89			0
a resident also contacted the vote 's returning officer - who oversees the election - to complain they had been approached by an unnamed party activist in the polling station as they went to cast their ballot paper			2
and another complained that @entity45 donors allegedly supplied junior members with food and lodgings in exchange for hitting the campaign trail			2
the complainant said : ' i feel sure other candidates in this election must have felt that this was completely unfair			0
' @entity67 also reported how local election campaigns - which coincided with a parliamentary by - election - saw a complaint made about a defamatory party leaflet , while another prospective candidate in @entity115 apparently ' caused people in the street to sign a nomination paper to allow them to stand in the next elections ' - despite those signing the document believing it to simply confirm their status as local residents			1
bribe : in one case , a voter complained that wealthy party donors were luring young activists to a key seat with the ' unfair ' promise of free curry according to separate figures from the @entity134 , 29 million votes were cast at polls held in the @entity136 last year			1
this included local elections , @entity140 elections and elections for directly elected mayors across the @entity136 as well as parliamentary and police and crime commissioner by - elections and the scottish independence referendum			1

one of these cases resulted in a conviction after an individual had stolen campaign signs promoting both the @entity156 and conservative parties in the @entity159 area			0
an @entity134 spokesman said : ' the figures show that proven cases of electoral fraud remain rare , but it is important that no one underestimates how serious it is when it does occur			0
' electoral fraud can refer to many offences , from impersonating a voter at a polling station to making a false statement on nomination papers to become a candidate			2
' we have long known that , when fraud is committed , candidates and campaigners are the most likely offenders and voters are the victims			0
' although there are clear plans in place to prevent and detect fraud ahead of the elections in may , there is also a challenge to campaigners			0
' they must ensure their behaviour builds trust with all voters , and all those involved in elections must make it a priority to communicate what is and what is not acceptable behaviour at election time			0
' assistant chief constable @entity196 of @entity197 , the national policing lead for electoral fraud , said : ' a statement about someone 's character is different to a statement about their political views			0
' a comment about a candidate 's politics is probably fair game , but to call someone a bigot or a terrorist or an extremist , for example , is different			0
it can get very unpleasant			0
' anyone concerned about electoral fraud is asked to contact the @entity134 or @entity218 .			0
