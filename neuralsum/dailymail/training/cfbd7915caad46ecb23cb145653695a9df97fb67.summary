@entity0 has been thrown an election lifeline as a new opinion poll reveals that @entity3 could avoid a total wipeout in @entity5			1
the @entity7 survey , published today , reveals a ten - point gap between @entity3 and the @entity9 , while around a quarter of voters remain undecided ahead of may ’s contest			1
if replicated in the general election , the @entity13 would still seize a huge number of seats from its old rival , sending a record number of mps to @entity21			1
but some of @entity3 ’s biggest names would cling on with reduced majorities , including @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity28 's @entity13 is set to seize a huge number of seats from its old rival labour in the upcoming general election the picture remains incredibly bleak for the @entity34 , however , with only 4 per cent of @entity5 set to vote for the party			1
that could leave it with only two seats , terminating the political careers of chief secretary to the treasury @entity40 , women ’s minister @entity42 and former @entity5 secretary @entity43			0
the @entity44 would enjoy a mini-revival , adding an extra seat to their current tally of one			0
@entity50 ’s leading elections expert professor @entity51 said : ‘ today ’s poll gives @entity3 some hope of minimising the damage that the @entity13 threatens to inflict on its representation at @entity21			1
‘ if the @entity13 lead is kept down to ten points , as this poll suggests could happen , the party might still hang on to half its seats at @entity21			2
even so , such an outcome could still scupper @entity0 ’s hopes of winning a @entity64 majority			2
’ @entity7 surveyed 1,006 adults aged 18 and over between january 14 and february 2			0
unusually for a pollster , voters were interviewed face - to - face , rather than over the phone or online			0
among those who stated a preference and said they were certain to vote , the @entity13 is on 41 per cent – double its share of the vote in 2010			0
labour trails on 31 per cent , with the @entity44 on 16 per cent , the @entity76 on 6 per cent , the @entity34 on 4 per cent and @entity77 on 2 per cent			0
with a uniform swing across the country , that would hand the @entity9 35 seats and reduce @entity3 ’s total from 41 to 20			2
a new opinion poll reveals that @entity0 's @entity3 could yet avoid a total wipeout in @entity5 in the upcoming general election some of @entity3 ’s biggest names may yet cling on with reduced majorities , including @entity25 ( right ) and @entity26 ( left ) , according to the survey the findings differ from most other recent polls , which gave the @entity13 a much bigger lead			1
a @entity93 survey published last week put the @entity13 on 48 per cent , with @entity3 on 27 per cent			2
@entity94 , head of @entity95 said : ‘ twenty - six per cent of all adults aged 18 - plus in @entity5 , and 24 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote on the day , are currently undecided , suggesting there is still considerable scope for all parties to influence the final results			0
’ a spokesman for @entity3 said : ‘ this poll shows yet again that only @entity5 @entity3 is big enough to defeat the @entity13 in @entity5			2
’ @entity13 general election campaign director @entity105 mp said : ‘ this poll shows a strong lead for the @entity13 – but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote and seat in may			1
‘ it will come as a major blow to @entity114 and the @entity3 leadership in @entity5 that since taking over as @entity117 last year , people are no more likely to vote for @entity3 than they were under @entity118			0
people can only make @entity5 ’s priorities @entity21 ’s priorities by voting @entity13 in may			0
