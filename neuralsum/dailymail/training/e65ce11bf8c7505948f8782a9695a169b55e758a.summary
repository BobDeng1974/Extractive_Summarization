a woman has accused a barber shop of sexism after they refused to cut her hair - because she was n’t a man			1
@entity6 wanted to get her 5in - long blonde hair shaved off and patterns shaved into her hair but was left angry and confused ' when staff at a barbers told her : ' we do n’t do girls '			1
miss @entity6 said she felt ' humiliated ' after asking for a grade 2 or 3 cut with hair stenciling at @entity17 barbers in @entity18 , @entity19			1
teaching assistant @entity20 said she felt ' humiliated ' after she was refused a grade 2 or 3 cut with hair stenciling because the barbers did not ' do girls ' the 21 - year - old teaching assistant said : ' i do a lot of exercise and got a bit fed up with getting hot all the time			1
' so i decided to get my head shaved and possibly get some hair art , with tribal patterns cut into it			1
' i ’d heard @entity17 had a very good reputation so decided it would be the perfect place to nip into , but when i went in they refused to serve me			1
the 21 - year - old later got a tribal pattern at another barber shop ' they refused in front of a shop full of people , which was very embarrassing - on the grounds that i ’m a woman			2
' i already had very short hair , so it was n’t a particularly big job i was asking them to do			1
' i thought nothing of going to a barber ’s , essentially i wanted a haircut that is typically given to men so surely the best place to go was a barber ’s			2
i was told they would not give me essentially a male haircut as i am a woman			2
' the receptionist looked very embarrassed as i asked for an explanation and all she could offer is " we do n’t do girls " , whatever the cut			1
' when i asked was n’t this a bit sexist even she admitted it was			2
it ’s not like i asked for a perm or a girl ’s haircut			0
' my immediate reaction was : ‘ are you joking ? ’			0
it was so humiliating to be told that in front of a shop of 15 people , plus staff , all looking at me			2
' i walked out and went to the nearest hairdressers and they gave me a grade 2 , but could n’t offer the hair art so i did n’t get what i wanted			1
' the staff there were disgusted at the way i ’d been treated			0
' under the @entity84 , businesses must now justify giving a single - sex service			1
this means , for example , a barber shop might say they could not give a woman a perm because it was a style they would not normally do			0
@entity18 has apologised and the manager said the barber 's does not operate a no - women policy or sexist agenda @entity17 , in @entity18 , @entity19 , today apologised and insisted they do not have a ' sexist agenda '			1
in a statement , manager @entity99 said : ' we had a no women policy introduced 20 years ago after being threatened with legal action after trimming a girl ’s fringe			0
' if we have inadvertently broken the law we will endeavour to put this right immediately			0
' the member of staff who served @entity110 has unfortunately shown ignorance of this change of law in 2010 , which we support			0
' we do not operate a no - women policy or sexist agenda			1
' cutting women ’s and men ’s hair does require very different skills and knowledge and hairdressers across the world are trained up specifically as a male or female cutter			2
' however we should have provided that service because @entity110 asked for a men ’s cut			0
' i am deeply embarrassed and have apologised personally to her			0
' she was let down by ignorance of the law and poor customer service			0
' miss @entity6 , from @entity133 , @entity19 , later got a tribal freehand pattern at another barber shop , which she is happy with			0
she added : ' i was angry and confused as to why i was refused service just because i am a woman			0
' i was willing to pay good money for my haircut and give someone the opportunity to get creative with some stencilling in my hair			0
' i ’ve got no problem with going into a salon and seeing a man getting his haircut there , so why ca n’t i have the same treatment ? ' lots of women have said to me they have had a similar experience , but if a man can get the same cut there ’s no way a business can justify turning a woman away			2
