by @entity0 we 've had @entity2 , now it 's what you might call @entity5 off as a new @entity9 show pits more members of the public - this time gardeners - against each other in the hobby they love			1
and @entity13 is not for the weak - willed , insist the competitors - there are plenty of tears among the tomatoes and turnips			1
' this is the tough end of reality television , ' says @entity22 , a @entity23 sales manager who competes in the show in partnership with his yoga teacher wife @entity25			1
@entity26 with the judging panel of @entity13 , from left to right , @entity26 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 ' it 's nothing like those namby - pamby bakery programmes			1
this was four months of solid graft , and everyone rose to the challenge			1
' in the six - part series , presented by @entity26 and filmed last year during the growing season , nine pairs of gardeners are given a patch of ground in the scenic gardens of @entity45 in @entity46			1
@entity49 @entity48 judge and former head of @entity51 , @entity28 ’s a huge fan of grow - your - own and is a regular sight around the country judging allotment produce in his trademark bowler hat			1
@entity57 and author @entity29 used to appear on @entity58 , @entity59 and is best known for her books on chutneys and jams			1
she spent ten years running a cookery school in @entity64 and now lives in @entity65			1
@entity66 a resident of the @entity68 and one of @entity71 ’s leading floral designers , @entity28 has been inspiring and entertaining audiences with his demonstrations , workshops and classes for more than 20 years			2
they each have 15 weeks to work on their allotment for up to 30 hours a week in a bid to come up with prize - winning fruit , vegetables , flowers and herbs			2
most of the contestants spend their entire weekends there after a week doing their day job			1
and not only do they have to be green - fingered - they must also show culinary and flower - arranging skills			1
each week the contestants face three challenges , ranging from showing off their radishes and making bouquets from flowers they 've grown to coming up with delicious conserves made from their produce			1
there are three expert judges : the @entity48 's @entity28 , who looks at the quality of their produce , floral designer @entity30 , who gives the verdict on their flower arranging , and celebrity cook @entity29 , who tastes their curds and jams			1
silver - haired @entity28 has already been dubbed the @entity106 of the gardening world , and several contestants go a bit dizzy over him			1
' oh , i 'd start a @entity28 fan club , ' says @entity112 , a mother - of - two from @entity113 in @entity114			2
' he has a way about him you just ca n't help loving			2
there 's an attraction there that most women will get			2
he has the highest accolades in horticulture but he 's never condescending			2
' but the real stars are the great @entity71 public , as assembled by the producers			2
take @entity22 , 53 , and @entity25 , 45 , who as well as trying to grow produce on a weekly timetable have the extra headache of trying to time their planting in tune with the moon 's phases			2
contestants - @entity22 and his wife @entity25 ' we 've gardened bio-dynamically as a hobby for quite a few years now , ' says @entity25			1
' there 's a two - week window when you can plant every month , and you 're meant to plant different things - flowers , fruits , roots - on different days			2
it 's all plotted out with science , looking at the light levels and energy to give them their best harvest			2
' but that is n't an easy system to follow when you 're living more than an hour away from the patch you 're tending			2
' for the tv series , we only managed to do about 50 per cent of our growing bio-dynamically , ' says @entity25 sadly			1
' we both work so we were n't always able to get there when we needed to			2
' however , the couple have a secret weapon : @entity25 's yoga mantras , which she chants to the plants to give them good energy			2
' it 's something i do in the greenhouse at home , ' she says			2
' plants are living things and they like that energy			0
' and what did their rivals think of this prince @entity173 - like behaviour ? ' erm , they thought it was a bit different , ' says @entity22			0
but they are n't the only unconventional allotment growers among the show 's contestants			1
@entity112 and her mother - of - four sister - in - law @entity181 , both 44 , are blonde , glamorous and like to wear vintage dresses and heels while gardening			0
' we use our heels as diggers and false nails to scoop up seeds			0
we 're certainly not stereotypical gardeners - when we first turned up on our allotment we got some funny @entity192 ' we use our heels as diggers and false nails to scoop up seeds , ' says @entity112 , laughing			1
' we 're certainly not stereotypical gardeners - when we first turned up on our allotment we got some funny looks , but once people got to know us they could see that we knew what we were doing			1
she continues , ' there are lots of stereotypes about gardeners ; on tv they 're usually men wearing flat caps			1
we want to prove a point - that anyone can garden			0
i get sick of the shows where only middle - class men are allowed to have an opinion on gardening			0
' their passion for gardening started when @entity112 's parents got an allotment			0
' when they first started we all said , “ what have you got an allotment for ? ” but then we fell in love with it			0
it 's a brilliant way of getting organic fruit and veg without paying supermarket prices			1
' they admit to having been among the teariest of the contestants			1
' there were lots of tears , especially when someone had to go , ' says @entity112			1
but she adds , ' we know we look a bit fluffy but we knew we could use the fact that people would underestimate us to our advantage			0
' others have secret weapons of their own			0
for teacher @entity241 and her best friend of over 30 years , retired university lecturer @entity240 , it 's llama droppings			0
the pair , from @entity245 , @entity246 , both 63 , each have a llama : @entity248 ( named after the character @entity248 from a @entity251 sketch ) and @entity252 ' , in the @entity254 fashion )			0
@entity181 and her sister - in - law @entity112 ' i found out the properties of llama droppings when i went to a llama farm and the farmer collected some , saying it can sell on the internet for a fantastic price , ' says @entity241			0
' a few years ago my husband and i got the chance to buy a neighbour 's field so we thought we could n't do better than buy an aesthetic lawnmower - a llama			0
so we bought two boys , and @entity240 and i collect their droppings and use it on our garden			0
it 's good for everything from root vegetables to roses and was our secret weapon ; we knew no one else would have it			0
' meanwhile , it specialists and best friends @entity284 , 46 , and @entity285 , 42 , have more of a game plan than a secret weapon			0
the pair , who share an allotment in @entity290 , @entity291 , admit their main aim is to not come last			0
' we specialise in doing as little as possible but having successful results , ' says @entity285			0
' we have our own website which shows our successes and our mistakes ; we 're open about how rubbish we are			0
' rather than working , they enjoyed the social aspect of the show ; all the contestants have come away as firm friends after spending so many weekends together			1
' the closest we came to hard work was watching everyone else doing it , ' adds @entity285			0
the pair are a contrast to the duo the others deemed the most competitive : teacher @entity310 , 37 , and his wife 's best friend 's father @entity311 , who 's retired			0
the @entity315 pair had never gardened together before the show - @entity311 , 68 , stepped in when @entity310 's first partner pulled out because of the time commitment needed - but they quickly found a common love in organisation			1
while other contestants jot their plans on the backs of envelopes , these two have whiteboards			1
' why would you enter a competition and not want to win ? ' says @entity311			0
' we were competitive in an open way and if anyone asked us about our plans we 'd generally tell them			0
and we helped another team out when they lost some seedlings			0
i 'd say a few of the teams were probably even more competitive but with a more covert style			0
' even these two had their teary - eyed moments , though			0
' erm yes , when we realised we were candidates for elimination and also when some of our friends went , ' says @entity311			0
but despite the rivalry and tears , this appears to have been a peculiarly friendly competition			1
' yes , there were 18 of us and we were all very different in many ways , but we had one thing in common , ' says @entity241			0
' we all love growing			1
' the @entity13 starts on 15 april at 8pm on @entity351			1
the accompanying book is published by @entity353 on thursday , £ 20 .			0

a new series on @entity351 will put gardeners to the test
the green fingered contestants will demonstrate skills from veg growing to flower arranging
contestants on the show warn that there will be a few tears and *tantrums*
