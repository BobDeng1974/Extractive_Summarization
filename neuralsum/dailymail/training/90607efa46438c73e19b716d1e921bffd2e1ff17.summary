by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 16:38 est , 19 september 2012 these stunning surfing action shots capture all the energy of the adrenalin - fuelled sport from inside the crests of crashing waves			1
the images are the brainchild of @entity9 photographer @entity8 , who enlisted his bodyboarder pal to help snap the pictures as they took on the swell off @entity13 in @entity14 , a famous mecca for thrill - seeking surfers			1
the 34 - year - old attached a special lens to his camera along with a custom - made water housing to protect it from the surf , before handing the equipment to a professional bodyboarder to shoot pictures - even as the waves were poised to crash over his head			1
surf 's up : photographer @entity8 handed his equipment to bodyboarder @entity30 ( pictured ) who took this shot from within the crest of a wave in @entity14 mr @entity8 , who grew up near legendary surfing hotspot @entity36 in @entity38 , @entity9 , said : ' i work hard taking photos like this , but when they come off , it really is a bit of a fluke			1
' i had to set up my @entity46 digital slr camera with a super wide fish - eye lens inside a custom made water housing			2
' i adjust all the settings based on the lighting and hand the whole thing to bodyboarder @entity30 who has the fun job of catching one of these crazy waves - holding the camera in one hand			1
' @entity58 - fuelled : photographer @entity8 captured the powerful shots with the help of professional bodyboarder @entity30 ( pictured ) in the action : the images were captured in crashing waves off surfing hotspot @entity13 , on the island of @entity14 ' @entity68 waves ' : @entity9 photographer @entity8 in action beneath the waves the photographer said capturing the action shots was no mean feat. ' @entity74 ( @entity30 ) gets all the credit			1
it 's not easy for him , ' said mr @entity8 , who said shots can easily be ruined by water drops getting on the camera lens , or the camera being ripped out of the bodyboarder 's hand by the impact of the surf			2
' he could frame it badly by accident as he has no idea where the camera is pointing , ' the photographer explained			2
' he could wipe out and have the camera ripped out of his hand , or smash onto the coral reef and flood my camera			2
so much can go wrong , so when you nail a good one it 's quite exciting			0
' we were very lucky this particular day that everything went to plan			0
the waves were perfect for this kind of work and we had it to ourselves			1
' every wave my friend caught with the camera was both exciting and nerve - wracking , knowing we would either have something special , or a broken camera			0
' mr @entity8 said he grew up bodyboarding at @entity36			0
' some of my friends became professionals , opening an opportunity for me to combine my love of surf travel with my friends and photography , it was perfect			0
' as you get more experience , inspiration and ideas you start to try new things , and when the conditions align you can put these ideas into effect , ' he said			0
' it takes time and customised equipment - which is not cheap - but when you nail that magic moment and people appreciate it , it 's all worth it			0
