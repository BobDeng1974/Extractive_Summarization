the presence of strange balls of light hovering over a valley in central @entity4 has baffled scientists for years			2
known as the @entity7 , the flashing orbs can be as large as cars and have even attracted attention from ufologists			2
but now scientists think the unusual lights could be formed by a natural ‘ battery ’ buried deep underground , created by metallic minerals reacting with a sulphurous river running through it			1
they have attracted attention from ufologists , but now scientists think the unusual lights could be formed by a natural ' battery ' @entity27 of the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , has studied the @entity32 site since 1996			1
he found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side of the river running through it , and rich in copper on the other side			0
@entity27 then used rock samples from the site in @entity43 to create a miniature valley and dunked them in river sediment			1
he found that electricity flowed between the two rocks and that this could light a lamp			0
dr @entity27 believes bubbles of ionised gas are created when sulphurous fumes from the @entity52 react with the humid air of the valley			1
the geology also forms electromagnetic field lines in the valley , which could explain why the orbs of light move around			2
if the theory is proven correct , it could open up a new way of storing energy			0
some of the lights drift gently through the sky for up to two hours , while others flash white or blue and streak through the valley , disappearing in seconds , @entity64 reported			0
a computer engineer called @entity73 from @entity74 in @entity4 , has been looking for the physics behind the natural phenomenon since 1982 , when frequent light shows captured the attention of the press and scientists alike			0
he set up @entity81 in a bid to unite experts trying to unravel the mystery of how the mysterious orbs are formed , and was able to quickly rule out theories that the lights came from planes , vehicles or buildings			1
the researchers noticed a small fluctuation in the areas ’ magnetic field before the formation of the lights , but when they measured radioactivity and seismic activity – both of which could cause such a phenomenon – there was nothing unusual at the site 248miles ( 400km ) north of @entity43			1
an international team of experts then measured the size , shape and speed of the orbs using radar and spectral analysis to examine the elements that make up the light			1
fully charged : one expert has studied the @entity32 site since 1996 and has found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side of the river running through it , and rich in copper on the other side			1
the sulphurous water in the river creates a giant battery they revealed that the lights make no sound , appear to be cool and do not leave any scorch marks on the ground , unlike ball lightning			1
they do however sterilise an area upon contact , killing the soil microbes			0
@entity27 of the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , has studied the @entity32 site since 1996 and found that rocks in the valley are rich in zinc and iron on one side of the river running through it , and rich in copper on the other side			1
‘ if there is sulphur in the water in the middle , it makes a perfect battery ’ he said			0
together with a colleague from the @entity149 , the scientists used rock samples to create a miniature valley and dunked them in river sediment			0
they found that electricity flowed between the two rocks and that this could light a lamp			0
dr @entity27 believes that bubbles of ionised gas are created when sulphurous fumes from the @entity52 react with the humid air of the valley			1
the geology also forms electromagnetic field lines in the valley , which could explain why the orbs of light move around			2
‘ this electrical field creates a path that could be the ‘ main road ’ of the lights inside the valley , ’ dr @entity27 told @entity166			0
@entity171 , an electrical engineer at @entity74 , thinks that the energy needed to make the clouds glow could come from the charge building up			0
there are many other competing theories as to how the light may be formed , although the battery theory seems to be the most probable based upon current evidence			2
scientists revealed that the lights of @entity32 - which lies 248miles ( 400km ) north of @entity43 - make no sound , appear to be cool and do not leave any scorch marks on the ground , unlike ball lightning			1
they do , however , sterilise an area upon contact , killing soil microbes some experts think some sort of plasma causes the light as when a gas ionises it forms a cloud of ions and electrons – plasma – that produce light			1
plasmas can be cool to touch and can also kill microbes , but they require incredibly high temperatures and a huge supply of energy to be produced			0
others believe the lights are a type of ball lightning because similar balls of light spotted and analysed in @entity210 showed they were formed of silicon , iron and calcium – which are present in the @entity32 lights , along with the addition of an element called scandium			1
but the @entity32 lights do not appear when there is lightning , leading dr @entity171 to suggest another idea			2
he proposed that the valley ’s shape , climate and geology generate a massive electric charge and that static electricity on the mountains were whipped up by strong winds			0
other experts believe the lights are powered by radioactivity and the decay of radon in the atmosphere			0
they think the lights are made from ‘ dusty plasma ’ containing ionised dust particles			2
they will search for the presence of radon in the valley to test their idea that bubbles of the gas could erupt from the ground , pick up dust and enter the air as a glowing orb			1
whatever the reason for the lights ’ formation , the answer could lead to a new way of storing energy			0
‘ if we have some kind of installation that we could pick up charged particles and lock them inside , then you can store energy , ’ dr @entity171 said .			0

*hessdalen* lights can be as large as cars and have been spotted in @entity43
*numerous* theories have attempted to explain how they are created
one claims metallic rocks divided by a sulphurous river provide a natural ' battery ' which provides the right conditions for orbs
@entity30 expert used samples from the site to make a battery to test this idea
he thinks bubbles of ionised gas are made when sulphurous fumes from the @entity52 react with humid air , forming the balls of light
but other experts think they *'re* a type of ball lightning or made from plasma
