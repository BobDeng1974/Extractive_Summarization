whether you ’re waiting in line for the new @entity2 or camping in the woods , sometimes you just need a makeshift bed			0
so to help you get 40 winks without having to make do with the cold hard ground , one company has designed a wearable futon you can carry with you			1
the coat - like bed is full of padding so you can rest easily on the floor , and it can also be rolled up like a sleeping bag			2
@entity16 - based office company @entity14 has created a wearable futon			1
the @entity18 can switch between ' coat ' and ' bed ' ( shown ) functions			2
when going to bed the padding provides a ' comfortable ' sleeping place			0
a supplied air mat can also provide additional padding when on the floor the somewhat bizarre @entity18 was created by @entity16 - based @entity28 office supply manufacturer @entity14			1
it can be fastened at the neck and the bottoms of the legs fold up to adjust for different heights			0
the ' futon ' is one - size fits all as the sleeves can be rolled up to different sizes this can also change the fit of the ‘ coat ’ depending on the season			1
the pack includes an air mat to provide a full blanket and futon set so you do n't necessarily have to sleep on the ground with the wearable futon by itself while the main coat - futon can roll up into a sack like a sleeping bag , the air mat can be folded into a small @entity52 - sized bag			1
the sleeves and legs can also be folded up so that you do n't trip over yourself while you are walking around with it in ' coat mode '			0
the product itself is made of nylone , polyethylene and polyester			0
in total the coat weighs about 1.5lbs ( 700g ) , which should make it relatively easy for most to wear and carry			0
in size it measures 5.25ft ( 1.6 metres ) long and two feet ( 0.6 metres ) wide , while the air mat is 9.45ft ( 2.88 metres ) long and 2.3 ft ( 0.7 metres ) wide			2
that should be comfortable enough for most people , but if someone wants to share your ‘ bed ’ they ’ll probably need a @entity18 of their own			2
the mat can take a load of up to 440lbs ( 200kg ) without breaking			0
the product is available now for about £ 25 ( $ 40 ) from supplier @entity14 , although there 's no news of a release in other territories yet .			1
