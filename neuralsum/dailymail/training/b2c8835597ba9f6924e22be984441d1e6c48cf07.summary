by @entity0 follow @ @entity1 even by pre-season standards , @entity2 had endured a torrid afternoon			1
invariably he had passed it to an opposition jersey or , worse still , straight out of play			0
but following a sedate 88 minutes , it was he who sparked life into this most turgid affair			0
@entity11 attacked the by - line and drew back to the edge of the area where @entity2 was lurking			2
embrace : managers @entity15 and @entity17 greet each other before the game tussle : @entity21 and former @entity23 midfielder @entity22 fight for the ball given how he had performed until that point , fans in the @entity26 would have been forgiven had they ducked for cover			1
but the @entity31 international kept his composure and produced the game 's one moment of quality , tucking into the bottom corner to win the game for his side			1
it was @entity40 's final friendly of the summer but manager @entity15 would have taken little from it			1
in the 10th minute @entity43 escaped down the right but his low cross skipped off the greasy surface and into the arms of @entity48 with @entity49 sliding in			2
the best chance of the opening exchanges came the way of the visitors when @entity54 split the back four to spring @entity55 clear			0
the striker , however , tried to be too cute and his chip was easily gathered by @entity58			0
slide : @entity60 slides in for a tackle during the first half against @entity63 pain : @entity60 goes down after a heavy challenge during @entity67 's final pre-season friendly escape : @entity21 skips away from @entity69 during the match at @entity71 tackle : @entity22 puts in a tackle on @entity21 , not something the creative midfielder is renowned for transfer : new signing @entity77 goes in for a challenge rather tentatively and that was as close as either side came during a subdued first half			1
@entity15 introduced @entity83 during the break and his arrival triggered an improvement in tempo			2
@entity88 swapped passes with @entity49 and burst into the area only to see his low drive blocked by a sliding @entity92			0
@entity83 then escaped three defenders but , with options left and right , elected to shoot and scuffed tamely into the arms of @entity48			0
the @entity63 stopper was again called into action on the hour mark , producing an instinctive one - handed save to deny @entity99 after he had headed towards the top corner from @entity77 's corner			1
and so it was left to @entity2 to win it after fine work from @entity11			2
thankfully , the full - time whistle sounded soon after			0
competitive action can not come quickly enough			0
manager : @entity15 will be hoping for a better season than last , which trailed off in the second half forward : @entity49 signed this summer from @entity31 side @entity113 battle : former @entity40 midfielder @entity11 tussles with @entity115 celebration : @entity2 after scoring his side 's 88th minute winner , @entity11 assisted the goal click here to start picking your fantasy football team now ! there ’s £ 60,000 in prizes including £ 1,000 up for grabs every week …			1
