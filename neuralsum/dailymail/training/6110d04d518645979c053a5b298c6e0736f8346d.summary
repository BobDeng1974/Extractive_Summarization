remarkable @entity7 was knocked down whilst walking home from school in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the eight - year - old escaped with only minor bruising but concerned doctors noticed he was suffering from memory lapses and called for a cat scan on his head			0
it showed an apple - sized dark patch on the right side of @entity7 's brain and an mri scan at @entity23 revealed it was an aggressive tumour called an anaplastic ependymoma			1
@entity7 , eight , was hit by a car on the way to school			1
when he was taken to hospital doctors discovered he had a very aggressive brain tumour @entity7 with his mum @entity31 before his operation to remove his brain tumour last month			1
the schoolboy is on the road to recovery from a brain tumour thanks to being knocked down by a car patients suffering from the tumour would usually suffer headaches , loss of vision and vomiting , but @entity7 had shown none of the symptoms			1
a week later surgeons removed the cancer but to remove some cells that remain the @entity50 is paying for specialist proton beam treatment in @entity52 , @entity53 , not available in the @entity54			1

' @entity7 returned to his classes at @entity78 this week for the first time since being knocked over and @entity31 said it was as though he had never been ill. a week after his @entity82 scan , @entity7 underwent a seven hour operation to remove the tumour			2
although the operation was a success , the aggressiveness of the tumour meant that , even if a few cells remained , it would soon grow back			0
radiotherapy is available in @entity91 but is not ideal for treatment on the brain and , because of @entity7 's age , could cause damage			2
@entity97 beam treatment is seen as a safer alternative but is not available in this country so the @entity50 is paying for him to receive treatment in @entity52 , @entity53			0
the treatment , accommodation and flights for @entity104 and @entity7 are being paid for but they will still have to pay for food and other living costs for the eight weeks he will receive treatment			2

' he 's been such a fighter throughout and was up and about within days of the surgery ' it 's a heartbreaking thing for any mother to go through and this has been an incredibly hard couple of months but , when he 's running about , you tend to forget			0
' it 's when you 're on your own that it really hits you			0
' @entity7 and @entity31 are expected to fly out to @entity184 in the next four weeks but she said , after the eight weeks of treatment , she wanted to continue to raise money in the fight against brain cancer			1
