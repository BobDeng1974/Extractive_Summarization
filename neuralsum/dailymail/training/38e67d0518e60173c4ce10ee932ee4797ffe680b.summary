@entity1 's vote for independence could have direct implications for @entity4 , with perhaps the biggest one being a change to the national flag			1
should @entity1 vote ' yes ' in today 's referendum , the @entity9 flag could well lose the white cross of @entity12 which forms the base of the @entity9 @entity14			1
that would mean a complete redesign of the @entity9 flag			0
if that happens , it 's likely to spark calls for @entity4 to change its flag too			1
both countries have federal elections this month and key candidates have already flagged their intentions to push for change			0
the problem , according to the experts , is that unlike the @entity31 , @entity25 have not yet been able to settle on one design , despite many years of trying to find an alternative			1
this 1993 design by @entity44 won a @entity46 competition and was third in @entity48 's flag design competition in the same year this effort by @entity50 was first pick by viewers of @entity46 @entity44 , from @entity4 , says this is his take on making the @entity54 more prominent @entity55 reported that this 1994 flag design by ' @entity57 - is a kangaroo in @entity60 colours			1
it was voted the third best in an internet poll associated with @entity48 's 1997 - 2000 design competition ' ' if the @entity14 was to be changed from its current design , you 'd take out the very foundation of the whole flag and be left with a collection of crosses on a white field - there would be some awkwardness and embarrassment about that i am sure , ' said @entity44 of @entity4			1
' whether other countries with the @entity14 would change their own is the question			1
' but one option is to change it with black and green , the colours of the @entity83 and @entity84 and you would have a hybrid mix that would look simply awful			0
' his colleague @entity86 said : ' if the @entity9 could change its flag , which has been going around for 400 years , you 'd be right in saying that would neutralise any argument that we can not because we 've had it for 100 years '			2
' this would be another reason to re-examine the issue but any change would require the leadership of the prime minister , and the last pm to support change was @entity100 , until he discovered the referendum			1
' @entity102 from the @entity103 , the authority which administers flags for the @entity9 and other parts of the @entity107 , does n't believe it will cause any problems			0
' i ca n't see that this would have any effect on the version of the @entity14 which appears in the flag of the @entity25 , ' mr @entity102 said			1
this flag ( above ) by @entity116 won @entity48 's @entity117 in 2000 @entity119 's design ( above ) has had plenty of support since it was unveiled in 1983 mr @entity44 added that @entity4 's inability to agree on a design which best defines the country is a significant issue			1
' i have n't seen anything yet in the many @entity25 competitions , and frankly the one that stands out still is the @entity131 flag - it is a very powerful flag and anyone who has been to @entity134 knows how strong a symbol it is , ' he said			1
' the @entity131 flag means something because of its history but white stars on white bars are a nonsense , there would have to be the work done			0
but @entity144 said none of the alternatives compare to the @entity131 flag			0
he described it as ' powerful ' mr @entity44 believes , however , @entity31 and @entity32 are likely to move quickly , with prime ministers in both countries raising the issue			1
' @entity151 made a new @entity32 flag one of his election promises and @entity154 said that if he is returned in @entity31 's election soon , that the flag question would be looked at and the @entity157 agrees , ' added mr @entity44			1
for @entity4 to make any move , it could only happen by way of a national vote or a change to the @entity163			1
@entity151 has made a new flag a key plank of his election promises leading up to @entity32 's general election @entity31 are likely to vote on whether they want a new flag soon , as both prime minister @entity154 and @entity171 counterpart @entity170 have both thrown their support behind change			1
pro-republicans have weighed into the argument too , suggesting the push by @entity1 serves as a lesson for @entity25 to have courage in the face of change , irrespective of whether the @entity182 vote wins or not			1
academics agree that this ' once in a lifetime opportunity ' will have international ramifications			0
' the move to independence by @entity1 is a much bigger step than @entity4 moving to a republic , so a yes vote success with mass celebrations is quite likely to be infectious among nationalistic movements , ' professor @entity187 of @entity188 said			1
' it could well very be contagious when people recognise just how large the consequences are for @entity1			2
' communications minister @entity199 was once chairman of the @entity200 but his boss , prime minister @entity201 ( right ) remains a staunch monarchist however , the @entity203 ( @entity200 ) said the @entity1 vote should have no bearing down under			2
' there is one parallel however , that an awful scare campaign has been waged there too , as it was here during our referendum , ' said @entity200 national director @entity213			0
' we need to be having our own debate now and for the next couple of years , so there 's real information out there in the general public			0
' there needs to be bi-partisan support , which we do n't have at the moment , but only then will we be able to have a true vote , although this winner - take - all system is still not the answer as far as i 'm concerned			0
' @entity213 of the @entity200 says the only point of comparison between the @entity1 vote and @entity4 's 1999 republican referendum is ' an awful scare campaign ' against the yes vote @entity200 has confirmed that a new push has started , some 15 years after a referendum on the republic was put to the @entity25 people - it was lost 55 to 45 per cent			1
' the question has to be right , so we are of the view that random deliberative groups should be selected to discuss the real issues , ' mr @entity213 said			0
' if there are concerns about losing our @entity9 heritage , let 's fix that into the constitution , if there is a worry about not being part of the @entity107 , let 's put it in that we still remain in it			0
' we need agreement on a true head of state , someone who truly works for and represents the country			0
' mr @entity213 also said that ' rather than look to @entity1 's result we should look a close look at @entity262 , a country we have very close ancestral ties with , as a great example of how presidents of a strong republic can lead and inspire and bring together a nation '			1
' times have changed , and so have we			0
our place in the world is secure and we are proud of who we have become			0
' we are one of the greatest nations , have one of the best democratic systems and have proved how capable we are			0
' the countdown is on ! crowds gather in @entity277 , @entity1 for one of the final pro-independence rallies @entity282 professor , @entity280 expects the uncertainty created by a win for the @entity182 vote will spell big changes in the @entity25 dollar 's value against the pound			1
despite the serious nature of the @entity1 vote , it has n't stopped some taking to social media to put a humorous spin on the push for independence even @entity44 agrees the identity issue needs dealing with before the flag debate is had			1
' i think @entity25 have got to work out who we really are then if the flag measures up , ' he said			2
there are other possible repercussions			0
a yes vote for @entity1 independence could mean a stronger @entity25 dollar against the @entity308			1
that boost to the currency would likely translate into fewer brits travelling @entity312			0
further , it 's feared there 'd be an adverse impact on resources exports and that @entity25 wine sales would drop			2
@entity282 professor @entity280 expects the uncertainty created by a win for the @entity182 vote will spell big changes in the @entity25 dollar 's value against the pound			2
he said while it 's difficult to predict , the @entity323 could rise 10 to 20 per cent against the pound from its current level of about 55.7 @entity9 pence			0
' the pound and the @entity25 dollar are one of the world 's most commonly traded currency pairs , due to our shared heritage , ' he said			2
' the biggest @entity25 exports to the @entity9 are gold , coal , lead and alcoholic beverages , like wine - those would be the ones most likely to be affected			2
' a weaker pound would also make trips from @entity9 to @entity4 much more expensive and less appealing			2
a ' no ' supporter is stopped by police while trying to get into the ' @entity182 ' supporters zone as the vote for change campaign held another rally ahead of the vote for independence , outside @entity351 in @entity352 is the @entity353 in peril ? a @entity182 supporter dressed as @entity357 character @entity356 makes his thoughts clear at least 620,000 @entity311 visit each year ( second only to @entity31 ) generating almost $ 3.5 billion for the @entity25 economy			1
professor @entity280 said changes in currency values have impacted tourism flows of other countries in the past			0
' when the yen has been stronger that 's been associated with more tourism from @entity368 , ' he said			0
' with the @entity371 and @entity372 , changes in the exchange rate seem to have an impact on tourism between the two countries			0
' @entity377 chief currency strategist @entity376 said financial markets ' jitters could last several years , if @entity1 votes for independence			2
' essentially what @entity1 will start to do is the negotiation process whereby it becomes and independent nation , ' he said			2
' we 're talking about 300 - plus years of history being un-stitched , that 's not something that can happen overnight			0
' if the ' yes ' vote gets over the line , @entity1 would become independent in 2016 and it will , at least initially , keep the @entity9 pound as its currency .			0

@entity4 's flag *includes* the @entity14 , which is made up of the red @entity395 , the @entity1 @entity396 and the @entity398 's *saltire* of @entity262
@entity4 's flag can be changed by referendum
@entity31 and @entity32 are set to be among the first to act to change
@entity25 republicans believe the support for @entity1 independence shows @entity25 should ' not to be scared ' of change
@entity25 voted 55 **%** to 45 **%** against becoming a republic in a 1999 referendum
