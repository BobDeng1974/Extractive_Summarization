by @entity0 streaking rapidly across the skies , it resembles a flying saucer from a sci - fi movie			0
but this is no spacecraft piloted by aliens invading the @entity8 ... it is the latest state - of - the - art drone being tested by the @entity9			1
sleek , silver and capable of travelling at subsonic speeds , the bat - winged @entity10 is a £ 1billion test aircraft developed to help the @entity14 develop the next generation of unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity17 )			1

the drone is capable of travelling at subsonic speeds the @entity10 taxies to its launch position on the flight deck aboard the nuclear powered aircraft carrier @entity25 , off the coast of @entity27 on sunday instead of being piloted by remote control , the @entity10 flies autonomously using state - of - the - art gps navigation technology and flight control software			1
commanders will programme the drone ’s on - board computer with a mission - for example , spying on or bombing a target - and it will follow these ‘ orders ’ to navigate to its destination unless a human ‘ pilot ’ on the ground steps in			0
the @entity10 drone is the first designed to operate an aircraft carrier			2
these extraordinary photographs were taken as it took off and touched down from the warship @entity25 as it sailed in the ocean on sunday			0
launching drones from carriers would mean the @entity14 did not need permission from other countries to use their bases			2
flight deck crew prepare to launch the drone from the @entity58 carrier - it is the second aircraft carrier involved in the testing of the @entity10 admiral @entity60 talking about the @entity9 's experimental unmanned aircraft			1
the drone is the first designed to operate from an aircraft carrier launching drones from aircraft carriers would mean the @entity65 would not need permission from other countries to use their bases a hook attached to the fuselage of the aircraft snags an arrestor cable on deck to bring it to a stop			1
the jet fighter - sized machines , developed by defence company @entity76 , weigh six tonnes and have a range of 2,100miles			0
senior @entity14 naval chiefs have described the ‘ miraculous ’ @entity10 as a ‘ glimpse of the future			2
’ the development could signal the end of @entity84 - style piloted air combat missions			0
they will be able to provide round - the - clock surveillance , gather intelligence and carry out lethal missile attacks without putting personnel at risk			1
the move to expand the @entity17 fleet comes amid growing criticism of @entity14 ’s use predator and reaper drones against terrorists in @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
it is not yet clear whether the drone will be able to open fire without explicit authorisation from its controller			0
the @entity105 has vowed that no uav would be able to decide when to attack humans			0
but critics have warned the introduction of ‘ artificial intelligence ’ into military weapons systems is a step towards the development of autonomous ‘ killer robots ’			0
the @entity10 is expected to be in service by 2020			2
