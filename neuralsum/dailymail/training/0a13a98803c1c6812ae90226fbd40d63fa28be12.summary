by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 10 august 2013 an @entity2 father is calling for his daughter 's suicide case to be reopened after she was discovered last year in her ex-boyfriend 's apartment with a gunshot wound to the head			1
@entity9 says his then 21 - year - old daughter @entity10 did not commit suicide and that evidence obtained through a freedom of information act request reveals enough evidence to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend @entity16			1
but the @entity19 state 's attorney @entity18 disagrees , announcing monday that he would not be filing charges against @entity10 's ex-boyfriend due to insufficient evidence			1
mystery : @entity23 was discovered with a gun shot wound to the head at her boyfriends home the morning of march 24 , 2012			1
her death was initially ruled a suicide , but was overturned by a jury of coroners this past january unaffected : one of the more suspicious aspects of the case was her ex-boyfriend 's stoic 911 call @entity10 was discovered the morning of march 24 , 2012 with a gunshot wound to her head			1
the most suspicious aspect of the case is her ex-boyfriend 's eerily calm 911 call			1
@entity16 was also working at the time as a police dispatcher			0
his roommate initially called 911 and said : ' we have a person in my living facility , who we believe to be dead			0
' he then hands the phone over to @entity16 who reported : ' i woke up and she was covered in blood			0
she overdosed , she bled out through her nose			0
' though @entity16 says he was sleeping when she overdosed , the official cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head - something that certainly would have woken @entity16 up			1
' the 911 tape tells it all , ' @entity9 told @entity62			0
' the guy 's so calm on the 911 tape you 'd think he was ordering a pizza or something			0
' mr @entity9 also points out that the gun was @entity16 's and his daughter was shot in the left side of the head , even though she 's right handed			2
@entity10 was excited about her new job and had plans to go shopping the weekend she was discovered dead , mr @entity9 said			2
@entity74 lt @entity73 spoke with the @entity75 about some of the other troubling details of the case			0
that morning , lt @entity73 said @entity80 were allowing @entity82 ' some latitudes ' before @entity74 arrived on the scene			0
when they arrived , @entity16 - the son of a longtime @entity85 sheriff 's deputy - already had his attorney present			2
police did not conduct a gunshot residue test on either @entity16 or his roommate 's hands			2
while @entity16 's roommate spent several hours speaking to the police , @entity16 was ' not being real accommodating with us ' and initially refused to sit for an interview with investigators , lt @entity73 said			2
pursuit of the truth : @entity10 's father @entity9 will continue to investigate his daughter 's death after a state 's attorney refused to bring up charges against her ex-boyfriend monday the girl 's death was originally ruled a suicide by a coroner , but a review by a jury of six coroners in january changed that ruling to ' undetermined ' after deliberating for less than 30 minutes			1
' it disgusts me that a young woman could lose her life like that and no one seems to care , ' mr @entity9 told @entity118			0
but he 's not letting the announcement monday get him down			0
he takes mr @entity18 's refusal to bring up charges as a challenge to continue investigating his daughter 's death to find more evidence to bring to the state 's attorney			1
justice for @entity10 : @entity10 's father is campaigning heavily to have her case reviewed , and hopefully bring up charges against @entity16			1
