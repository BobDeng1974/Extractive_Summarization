blogger @entity10 , pictured left , has highlighted ' @entity17 ' in her latest video , filmed with her daughter @entity14 , right , who takes delight in stopping her from doing her chores the video shows @entity14 pulling clothes out of the drawers faster than her mother can put them away the little girl then climbs into the drawer so she can reach the others to empty them the amusing video , which has had more than 50 million views on @entity28 , takes in a typical day at @entity10 's home in @entity30 , which she shares with husband @entity31			1
the footage shows @entity10 attempting to fold away @entity14 's clothes and put them away in drawers in her room â€“ only for the little girl to pull out the clothes faster than her mother can put them away			2
she then sabotages @entity10 's attempts to sweep the kitchen floor by spreading the dirt around again before her mother has a change to sweep it up in a dustpan			2
sweeping the floor is n't a simple task for @entity10 as the video filmed in the @entity47 home shows @entity14 spreads the dirt around the floor again before her mother can sweep it up the little girl also rolls in the dirt for good measure in the video that has had 50 million views on @entity28 then when @entity10 attempts to pack the dishwasher , @entity14 throws dirty , plastic plates out of the bottom shelf while her mother tries to load the top shelf - the same thing happens when @entity10 tries to tidy up her daughter 's toys as their bemused dog looks on			1
and it 's a similar story when she tries to load the washing machine as @entity14 pulls the dirty clothes out before her mother can put them all in			0
a shot of @entity14 rolling around in the garden in the mud and then covered in food when she eats reveals why @entity10 spends a lot of her day washing her daughter and changing her clothes			2

the little girl empties the washing machine before her mother can fill it up she also pushes the door closed before it 's full to further hinder her mother 's attempts to do the housework filling the dishwater is no simple task either as @entity14 find it fun to through the plastic plates out @entity10 said the many shares her video has had shows it 's not just her who has trouble getting anything done thanks to having a toddler around as @entity14 is here pictured closing the dishwasher before @entity10 has filled it @entity10 uploaded the video onto her personal website storyofthislife.com that charts her experiences and observations of motherhood			1
one of her other videos reveals why co-sleeping means no sleeping for the mother and another asks viewers ; which type of mom are you ? ' showing how some mothers are obsessed with disinfecting their child 's every move and not allowing them to touch something until it has been thoroughly cleaned first			0
@entity10 is pictured wasting her time tidying up toys as @entity14 just empties more on to the rug the toddler does n't stay clean for long thanks playing in the garden , left , and eating yoghurt , right no wonder @entity10 spends so much of the day washing her daughter and changing her clothes many parents have agreed that @entity10 's video is an accurate reflection of motherhood but @entity10 's video of her daily trials getting ' nothing done ' has been by far her most popular post			1

' mothers rushed to share the video and agreed it was an accurate reflection of their own lives			0
