poorer families are more likely to eat chicken nuggets and chips for dinner , while wealthier households consume more salad and rice , new research has revealed			1
the latest figures from @entity9 show that socioeconomic status and family income have a significant impact on foods consumed			1
at the top end of the scale , children eat more salad and rice , but as income decreases more chips , wedges , chicken nuggets and noodles are consumed			2
new research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads in the wealthiest households , 62 per cent of kids aged 6 - 13 will eat rice every week , while 55 per cent will also have salad at some stage			1
less than half will eat hot chips , fries , or wedges , while just over a third will consume noodles			0
around a quarter of these children will eat chicken nuggets during an average week			0
however at the other end of the spectrum childrens ' eating habits change quite dramatically			0
with each successive drop in socioeconomic status , children in the household are less likely to eat rice or salad , and more likely to eat noodles or chicken nuggets			0
kids from wealthier families will see more salad on the table , with 55 per cent consuming the greens in an average week at the lower end of the scale 60 per cent of children will consume chips , wedges or fries , but only 44 per cent will eat a salad during an average week			2
noodles are on the menu for 55 per cent of these kids , chicken nuggets are eaten by 40 per cent , and just half of these children will see rice on their table			0
' while the food that parents buy and give to their children is heavily influenced by the affordability of groceries , there may be many other issues at play such as the number of children ( and parents ) in the household , working hours , accessibility of fresh produce in the local area , as well as underlying attitudes and tastes , ' @entity70 , ceo , @entity9 said			1
the presence of rice at mealtimes has increased , and 62 per cent of kids at the higher end of the spectrum have it each week ' for example , price alone does not fully explain the inverse changes in popularity for rice and noodles among children across socio - economic quintiles			2
' the research also revealed that more parents are trying to make a conscious choice about purchasing additive - free food , which is up to 50 per cent from 45 last year			1
however figures in this section also show that as socioeconomic status declines , so does the amount of parents making the decision to buy additive - free foods			1
noodles and hot chips are eaten more frequently than salads in lower socioeconomic households despite this , increasing numbers of parents are paying closer attention to what they put on the table for their children			2
' more than five million @entity126 are parents with children under 16 in the home			0
our research into health attitudes shows that over the last five years an increasing proportion of parents are mindful of their own calorie , fat , dairy , and red meat intake , but are slightly less likely to be trying to limit how much sugar their kids eat , ' @entity70 said			0
' our @entity142 survey can connect parents ' demographics and household status with their health attitudes , grocery shopping behaviours , exercise habits and food consumption rates to deliver a 360 - degree view of the changing lifestyles of @entity126 families			0
' noodles are on the menu each week more often for children whose parents earn a lower income , over wealthier families			1

new research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads
families with a higher income are more likely to eat salads and rice
latest figures from @entity9 also show more parents are trying to buy additive - free foods
