by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 captain @entity3 should be moved back into a midfield role for monday 's @entity7 qualifier against @entity8 , according to @entity9			1
the @entity4 struggled to a 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity11 on wednesday , with @entity3 scoring the only goal of the game from the penalty spot			1
but @entity9 , who won 66 caps for his country , believes @entity17 should play his captain in a more withdrawn role when they visit @entity21 in @entity22			1
in his column for @entity43 , @entity9 wrote : ' it is a radical solution , and one i would propose just for the @entity8 qualifier on monday , but i would play @entity3 in midfield			1
' this is not an argument to say @entity3 is not a top striker			2
his record says that he is and , in an ideal world , i would have two @entity53 : one to hit those passes from deep and another to get on the end of them			0
he is the best passer in the team and he can play that midfield role better than anyone			2
' one thing you can be sure about @entity3 is that he is not bothered about taking risks			2
if he saw the pass was on , he would hit it			0
if it did not work out , that would not deter him from trying it again and again			0
he would make that pass more often than not			0

room for improvement : @entity9 believes @entity72 does n't pass the ball with enough flair in midfield vision : @entity3 would try ambitious passes if he was played in midfield on monday , according to @entity9 @entity80 engine : @entity81 drives between @entity82 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) @entity9 admits that he would prefer not to move @entity3 from his preferred role as a striker , but he deems it necessary given the limitations of @entity81 and @entity72			1
he added : ' moving @entity3 would be a compromise for @entity17 because this @entity4 team is not so blessed with goals that it can afford to lose its top goalscorer from the front line			1
' during and after the @entity94 i argued for @entity3 to be played as a centre - forward but , with these three ahead of him , he could be a huge influence			2
and he could still make runs into the box			0
' @entity99 looks to spearhead @entity4 revival			0
