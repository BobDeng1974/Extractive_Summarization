another trophy slipped through @entity2 ’ grip when they lost to @entity4 in the @entity5 semi-final at @entity7 on sunday			1
that elusive first piece of silverware is proving hard to attain and an itch is developing which is in dire need of being scratched			0
after spending more than £ 200million since taking charge at @entity14 in june 2012 , there is only so long the owners and fans will keep patient in their desire for dividends			2
@entity2 gives instructions to @entity21 during @entity14 's defeat against @entity4 @entity2 is set for his third season without a trophy after @entity14 were dumped out of the @entity5 twitching times can develop when the top clubs go through barren spells - and @entity2 ’ is beginning to enter such a period			1
during @entity2 ’ time in charge , @entity29 and @entity30 had spent more than their @entity33 rivals - so too have @entity34 by a fraction - but each of those have brought home something			1
@entity29 and @entity34 have won two trophies - including the @entity41 title - while @entity30 have one and are sure to add the league title to that soon			0
@entity45 has spent £ 183m , comparatively little , but managed to win two trophies over the past two seasons			1
that is less than rivals @entity49 , who have spent just under £ 200m and , like @entity14 , have won nothing			1
@entity52 celebrates his extra-time winner against @entity54 to seal @entity56 's spot in the @entity5 final @entity59 's first - half strike against @entity29 leaves @entity30 on the brink of winning the title while the country ’s best teams are filling their trophy cabinets , @entity2 ’ remains bare			1
the @entity66 half of @entity33 expect success and landed the @entity68 under @entity69 just before @entity2 took to the helm			2
analysis by @entity72 indicates that he has signed 22 players during his tenure , but only seven of those can be considered a success at this current time			1
his top signings have been @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , but the poor transfers outweigh the successful ones			0
@entity84 has gone for top young talent , ranging from 18 to 21 when he signs them			0
there is still time for some of those players - the likes of @entity91 and @entity92 - to prove their worth			0
but there will be only so much time			0
many of his big - money failures came last summer , when he tried to spend the money accrued from selling @entity99 to @entity100 for £ 75m			0
@entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 have all disappointed this term			0
like the younger potentials , each of those could still make their mark , but the question is if it does not come together next season - and they remain trophyless again - will @entity84 still be in charge to reap any of the rewards ? @entity80 , @entity104 and @entity113 reflect on @entity14 's semi-final defeat on sunday summer 2012 @entity115 , @entity116 , £ 10.5m farmed out to @entity117 for the whole of last season on loan then failed to secure a move away from @entity14 but has scored just once this season as a bit - part player			1
verdict : miss @entity124 , @entity125 , £ 15m one of @entity2 ’ first signings after he raided his former club			2
the plucky midfielder has not been spectacular so far but has still been a solid acquisition			0
verdict : hit @entity115 , pictured in action against @entity132 earlier this month , has scored just one goal for @entity14 @entity124 tackles @entity134 in @entity14 's defeat ; he has proved to be one of @entity2 ' best buys @entity138 , @entity139 , £ 2.4m failed to make a @entity41 start at @entity14 , having more joy in two loan spells at @entity143 , and was sold to @entity144 in january			1
verdict : miss @entity145 , @entity146 , £ 1m still only 20 , this signing could well come to fruition at a later stage , especially if some of his performances for the club 's under - 21 side are anything to go by			2
but has made only two appearances for the first team , both in the @entity68			0
verdict : miss january 2013 @entity79 , @entity30 , £ 12m who says january transfers never work ? went on to score 11 goals in 16 @entity14 games in the second half of the season after signing and has become one of @entity166 ’s top strikers			1
verdict : hit @entity80 , @entity168 , £ 8.5m what a snip £ 8.5m looks after the @entity170 , still only 22 , has become one of the league ’s best players			1
verdict : hit @entity80 and @entity79 , both signed in january 2013 , must be considered ' hits ' for @entity14 summer 2013 @entity175 , @entity176 , £ 6.8m the 22 - year - old is currently on loan at @entity179 after failing to break into @entity14 ’s first team and is yet to start a league match for them			1
verdict : miss @entity183 , @entity184 , £ 7.2m strikers are judged on their goals and @entity187 , now on loan at @entity176 , has scored only one of those for @entity14 in an @entity5 match			1
verdict : miss @entity81 , @entity117 , £ 9m been through some shaky spells but when on form , which he is at the moment , he is one of the @entity41 ’s best goalkeepers			0
verdict : hit @entity81 has endured some shaky spells at @entity14 , but when in form , he is one of the league 's best @entity91 , @entity199 , £ 800,000 the 22 - year - old has performed well on loan at @entity202 this season and time will tell if he can break into @entity14 ’s first team , but he has to be deemed a ‘ miss ' after only one substitute appearance so far			1
verdict : miss @entity208 , @entity34 , free at 34 , he is no longer one of the greatest centre - backs in the league but is by no means one of the worst and signing him on a free transfer was a shrewd piece of business			0
verdict : hit @entity216 cost @entity14 £ 18m and has failed to justify his price tag , while @entity208 joined on a free @entity216 , @entity218 , £ 18m can be a formidable central defender at times but is far too erratic to justify the £ 18m price tag			1
verdict : miss @entity222 , @entity199 , £ 7m yet to play for @entity14 and the defender has managed only a few appearances on loan at @entity226 and now @entity227			2
only 22 , but is running out of time to prove himself			0
verdict : miss summer 2014 @entity230 , @entity49 , free another who could well become a ‘ hit ’ in the future , but can not be considered one right now with the 21 - year - old not appearing for @entity14			2
verdict : miss @entity235 , @entity236 , £ 4m it felt like he was joining the club as a back - up player , but injury to @entity79 and lack of form from @entity104 thrust @entity235 into the spotlight and he has been unable to deliver			0
verdict : miss @entity235 , replacing @entity244 in @entity14 's win over @entity132 , is a bit - part player at @entity247 @entity101 , @entity236 , £ 25m @entity101 has admitted he is yet to repay the @entity14 fans for his hefty price tag and has been well short of his commanding displays for @entity236 in recent seasons			1
verdict : miss @entity252 , @entity146 , £ 10m @entity2 appears to be moulding can into a centre - back and at 21 he has played with a mature head that belies his tender years			2
verdict : hit @entity102 , @entity257 , £ 20m the @entity258 has been at times brilliant but has failed to produce that form on a regular basis and at £ 20m fans will be expecting far more			2
verdict : miss @entity252 has played with a mature head that belies his tender years since joining from @entity146 @entity14 @entity265 : £ 215.7m trophies won : 0 @entity30 @entity265 : £ 277.3m trophies won : @entity68 @entity29 @entity265 : £ 267.5m trophies won : @entity41 , @entity267 @entity34 @entity265 : £ 217.4m trophies won : @entity41 , @entity68 @entity49 @entity265 : £ 199.7m trophies won : 0 @entity56 @entity265 : £ 183m trophies won : @entity5 , @entity267 @entity103 , @entity236 , £ 20m another former @entity236 player who turned in a number of consummate displays on the south coast but has failed to replicate them in @entity33			1
become an error - prone player since his move			0
verdict : miss @entity92 , @entity275 , £ 10m the @entity276 is only considered a ‘ miss ’ due to not playing for @entity14 , but if he can replicate his form on loan at @entity275 when he returns , @entity2 could have a frightening forward at his disposal			1
verdict : miss @entity280 , @entity176 , £ 12m been an ever - present at full - back in @entity14 ’s side this season ; strong , fast and direct going forward and is not bad at defending as well			2
verdict : hit @entity104 , @entity285 , £ 16m his off - field problems outweigh his one goal in the league and three in other competitions			0
the controversial @entity290 has mustered all season			0
@entity2 needed a stellar name to replace @entity99 up front and @entity104 has not been that			0
verdict : miss @entity294 : 7 @entity295 : 15			0

@entity14 will go another campaign without silverware after @entity5 exit
it marks a third straight term where @entity2 has failed to deliver
he has spent over £ 200m on transfers but is yet to win a trophy at @entity247
and only a fraction of the 22 players he 's signed can be considered a ' hit '
