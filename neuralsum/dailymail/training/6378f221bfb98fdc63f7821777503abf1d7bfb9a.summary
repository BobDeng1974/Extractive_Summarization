by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 15 february 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 16 february 2013 radical plan : chancellor of the exchequer @entity2 could give away shares of the state 's stake in the @entity6 everyone in @entity8 could be given @entity6 shares worth hundreds of pounds before the next election , under plans being considered by @entity2			1
senior sources say the chancellor has decided to offload the state ’s 82 per cent stake in the bank before 2015			1
and @entity17 ministers believe the most radical solution – simply giving the shares away – has huge political benefits			2
it would pump more than £ 30billion into the economy , providing a much - needed boost without the need for pre-election tax cuts			0
the plan , which is being explored by @entity27 , the economic secretary to the treasury , would mean a share voucher being sent to everyone with a national insurance number , or possibly even everyone over the age of 18			2
treasury sources say the handout could be worth around £ 400 , but it might be worth as much as double that			1
the giveaway could be announced as soon as this year , with bank shares offloaded in 2014			0
voters would receive their windfall by january 2015 at the latest			0
an alternative plan would see the shares sold to taxpayers at a discount , in a reprise of the sell - offs of public utilities pioneered by the conservatives under @entity50			0
the previous government spent £ 45billion of taxpayers ’ money on propping up @entity6 in 2008			1
senior treasury sources say the chancellor has abandoned hope of recouping all the costs , with the government ’s shares currently worth just £ 31billion			1
however , as this loss has already been factored into the @entity8 ’s credit rating , officials believe that giving away the shares would not undermine the government ’s general economic strategy			2
business secretary @entity66 proposed a share giveaway in a speech earlier this month in which he said any hope of privatising the bank at a profit looked like a ‘ distant ’ dream			0
but the revelation that mr @entity2 and mr @entity27 are taking the plan seriously will surprise the @entity76			2
at the helm : @entity78 , @entity6 chief executive , has told insiders that he will clear most of the bank 's toxic assets by 2014 ‘ @entity2 has taken the view that he now wants to get this sorted out before the election , ’ a senior figure said			1
‘ he has given @entity27 pretty wide latitude to sort this out			0
‘ there is a realisation that there is no prospect of @entity6 ’s share price rising to the level at which we bailed the bank out , and it ’s not good for the bank or the government to hold on to our stake indefinitely			1
‘ obviously a giveaway to taxpayers before the election , who after all paid for it in the first place , is very attractive			0
’ business secretary @entity66 proposed a share giveaway in a speech earlier this month in which he said any hope of privatising the bank at a profit looked like a ' distant ' dream a @entity17 source said : ‘ one of the options of course could be to put it in our manifesto – but then @entity119 could do that as well			2
would n’t it be much better if voters were getting a cheque for £ 400 a few months before election day ? it would also be a very big stimulus			1
’ allies say mr @entity2 has decided he wants to offload the shares due to frustration at the government being dragged into a succession of scandals such as @entity133 rigging and bankers ’ bonuses			1
insiders say treasury ministers are spending a ‘ disproportionate amount of time ’ dealing with these issues			0
‘ what people do n’t understand is that even though we own over 80 per cent of the bank we ca n’t just tell them what to do , ’ said one			0
‘ our only real power is to sack the whole board , and that would n’t exactly inspire market confidence			0
’ the @entity151 plan has been strengthened by growing confidence that @entity6 will be ready to sell as early as next year			2
chief executive @entity78 has told industry insiders that the bank will have cleared most of the toxic assets from its balance sheet by spring 2014			0
however , experts believe the most likely scenario would see the government sell a tranche of shares at a loss with the aim of boosting the share price , to give it a better chance of recouping its money by selling the rest			1
although he plans to sell the @entity6 stake , mr @entity2 has no immediate plans to offload the government ’s 40 per cent slice of @entity172			1
this is because the bank concentrates on high street business rather than controversial investments .			0

@entity2 could decide to give away @entity6 shares before 2015
they would be given to everyone with a @entity183 number
previous @entity119 government spent £ 45 billion propping up @entity6 in 2008
treasury sources say the handout could be worth around £ 400
