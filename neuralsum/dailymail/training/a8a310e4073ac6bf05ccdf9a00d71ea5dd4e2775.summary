by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 11:43 est , 4 november 2013 a @entity2 action hero who chased volcanoes around the world more than a century ago is honoured in a new exhibition featuring the photographs he risked his life to take			1
@entity9 was the world 's first volcano - chaser , scaling the world 's most dangerous slopes in his quest to photograph volcanoes as they erupted			1
born in @entity17 in 1846 , @entity16 's extraordinary derring - do took him to the mouth of the most famous volcanoes : he saw @entity20 , @entity21 , and , in 1902 , the 20th century 's worst volcanic eruption			1
@entity23 , which devastated the islands of @entity25 and @entity26 in the @entity27			0
@entity9 , the world 's first volcano - chaser , risked his life to get photographs like this , of @entity32 , long before the days of health and safety rules smoke and lava billowing out of its angry mouth , the volcano on @entity36 in @entity37 could n't frighten @entity9 , who got close up to photograph it @entity16 put his life on the line time and again to take pictures of fire - spewing volcanoes - resulting in an astonishing collection of 5,000 photographs and artefacts			1
now , a century after @entity16 died on a boat on his way home from an exploration , the @entity48 is displaying the works of a brave @entity54 whose exploits captured the hearts and minds of the residents of his home city			2
the museum 's curator , @entity60 , said : ' @entity9 was one of @entity17 ’s pioneering figures and made valuable contributions to medicine , photography and volcanology			2
' it was the latter for which he became well known and he travelled all over the world to see the latest eruptions - sometimes risking his life			0
he was one of @entity17 's most colourful characters			0
' born when @entity72 @entity2 was just a few years into her reign , @entity16 attended @entity74 in @entity17 and then @entity75 where he trained as a doctor and specialised in ophthalmology			2
returning to his home city , he worked as an ophthalmic surgeon at @entity80 while developing interests in the then - emerging field of photography and also glaciers			1
this developed into a fascination with vulcanology , and as his knowledge grew , he set off on trips around the world - always involving long boat journeys - to see the volcanoes at first hand			0
@entity16 , an eye surgeon , was also fascinated by the volcanic aftermath : this image shows the island of @entity26 after it was destroyed by a volcano in 1902 a community torn apart : @entity16 , who never married , took this picture of @entity100 , @entity25 , after the massive eruption there devastation on @entity26 : @entity16 was the first to discover how the eruption and resulting devastation occurred - he worked it out by studying avalanches his love of volcanoes and incessant thirst to see them erupting , as well as to photograph the aftermath , meant that by 1900 @entity16 had visited and photographed most @entity114 volcanoes as well as those of @entity116 and the @entity117			1
he made his name in scientific circles with his clear descriptive and photographic records of a ‘ pyroclastic flow ’ ( or ‘ nuie ardente ’ ) - terrifyingly rapid and destructive flow of gases and hot rock that flows out of volcanoes			0
@entity16 witnessed this at first hand in 1902 as he watched the hot blast of gases from @entity130 that destroyed the port town of @entity100 , on @entity25			0
he worked out the physics behind this phenomenon and found that it was not dissimilar to a particular type of avalanche that he had seen the devastating effects of in the @entity138			0
the exhibition at the @entity48 showcases a selection of photographs taken from his vast collection and artefacts similar to those @entity16 took on his trips around the world , such as a magic lantern , a pinhole camera , pocket watch and his telephone , which was the first ever telephone in @entity17			2
tempest , who never married , died in 1913 on the @entity152 on the way home from his last trip , and was buried at @entity156			0
@entity16 never married , devoting himself instead to a life filled with death - defying trips to see the world 's deadliest volcanoes - this is @entity20 near @entity163 in @entity37 scorched earth : this picture , taken in 1902 , shows the ruined landscape on @entity26 in the @entity27 after the @entity23 volcano erupted there this photograph , one of thousands taken by the @entity2 explorer , shows the devastation wreaked by the 1902 eruption which devastated @entity26 and @entity25 around 5,000 photographs , artefacts and maps make up the exhibition about the life and discoveries of @entity17 's own action - hero , @entity9 , born there in 1846 tribute to an action hero from a century ago : the exhibition at the @entity48 is being staged to mark 100 years since @entity16 's death			1

@entity9 , who was born in @entity17 in 1846 , was a fearless explorer who discovered how volcanoes erupted
an eye surgeon , he became fascinated by vulcanology and travelled the globe to see volcanoes in deadly action
a new exhibition in his home city pays tribute to his astonishing explorations , and the photographs he took on them
