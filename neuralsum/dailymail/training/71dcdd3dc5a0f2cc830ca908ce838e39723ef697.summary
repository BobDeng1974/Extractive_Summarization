surely it ’s what many of us dream about while trudging into the office during another april downpour			2
why not escape the rat race and the grey skies to live on a sunny tropical island ? @entity8 has done just that			1
in 1962 , the @entity10 bought @entity8 - a small island just half a mile wide - in the @entity12 for the princely sum of £ 8,000 , and he has been living there ever since			1
he spends his days caring for the island ’s tortoises and birds that also call it home			1
when he bought @entity8 , it was overgrown with scrub so dense that coconuts could not fall to the ground			1
but @entity16 worked tirelessly to transform the island into his own little patch of heaven			2
living in this unique wildlife reserve , he has survived tropical storms , sharks , ghosts , a coup d’etat in the @entity12 and a mercenary raid			1
scattered over a vast area of the @entity23 , the 115 islands of the @entity12 are among the most spectacular on the planet			1
there are just 85,000 inhabitants , but hundreds of secluded beaches			0
i visited the @entity12 while filming my new @entity50 tv series , to find @entity52 pirates in the prisons and @entity55 @entity54 training local troops to repel more attacks			1
but it was a visit to @entity16 ’s island , and meeting the man himself , that caught my imagination			1
just a hop away from the capital , @entity66 , on the island of @entity68 , and surrounded by azure and turquoise waters , the 22½ acres of @entity8 stand out from the neighbouring islands , which are owned by billionaires , @entity74 princes and @entity76 oligarchs , and include some of the most glorious holiday retreats in the world			1
island : @entity8 was abandoned until @entity16 purchased it 50 years ago paradise : @entity16 wakes to the sound of rustling palm trees and the @entity23 lapping against the shore surrounded by protective coral reef , @entity8 looked wild and uninhabited - until i caught a glimpse of a wooden building poking through the trees			1
i was warmly greeted by @entity16 in his t - shirt and shorts , standing on a picture - perfect beach			2
@entity93 , wiry and tanned , he still has his @entity95 accent , which seems wildly out of place in such an exotic setting			0
together we climbed steps hewn out of the rock and past clusters of palm trees to where @entity16 ’s one - storey wooden house clings to the hillside			1
it ’s where he looks after his 120 giant tortoises			2
a whopper was sitting on the steps			0
among the world ’s longest living creatures , they have been known to survive for more than 180 years			2
giant tortoises are indigenous to the @entity12 , but have been killed off on most of the other islands			1
@entity16 has been gradually reintroducing them to his corner of the @entity23 , painting them with identifying numbers and giving them names such as @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 ( the island ’s latitude )			1
his house is eccentric and well - worn , a bit like its owner , and furnished with @entity129 souvenirs and curios that testify to @entity16 ’s years in the tropics			1
real life @entity133 : @entity16 has helped preserve the region 's giant turtles			0
he paints them with identifying numbers and even names them local : @entity16 still has his @entity95 accent , which seems wildly out of place in such an exotic setting outside i spotted a sign : ‘ please respect the tortoises			0
they are probably older than you			0
’ fluttering above the tortoises were just some of the 2,000 birds that @entity16 has encouraged to flock here there was the indigenous pigeon @entity153 , so named because it shares the colours of the @entity55 flag , and the beautiful reddish - orange fody weaver bird , a native of @entity158			2
as they feasted on rice from the five 50kg bags @entity16 puts out each week , they made a magnificent sight			0
we set off for a walk around @entity8 , with @entity16 bounding along in flip - flops			1
he first arrived in the @entity12 on holiday in the @entity168 , restless and seeking adventure after years spent working as a newspaperman in @entity129			1
‘ i started thinking about buying property almost as soon as i arrived , but i could n’t find the right place , ’ he told me			0
it was n’t until the very last day of his holiday that he heard about @entity8			1
‘ i knew the moment i set foot on the island that it was the right place for me			2
’ @entity16 had dinner with the owner and a deal was done			0
@entity10 ’s @entity133 had found his paradise			2
he hired his own man friday , a @entity12 called @entity186 , who helped him transform @entity8			1
together they planted palm trees , mango and paw - paw			2
they saved rainwater and pumped it up the hillside by hand , or rowed back to the main island to collect a barrel of fresh water			2
it was backbreaking , exhausting work			0
‘ my hands were covered in blisters , ’ said @entity16			0
when he arrived there were no birds on the island , so he brought ten from a neighbouring island - which promptly flew straight back			1
man friday : @entity16 recruited local @entity186 to help him make @entity8 habitable natural disguise : surrounded by protective coral reef , @entity8 looks wild and uninhabited he brought a few more , which also disappeared			1
but then a couple returned			0
@entity16 started feeding them , and more birds settled on the island			2
slowly the trees grew and fruited , and eventually water , electricity and a phone cable were piped across from @entity68			0
‘ but we were n’t doing it to make it into a national park or anything like that , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ no , no , no ! we were doing it to make it habitable for me			0
’ it might have been accidental conservation , but while the rest of us have been busy concreting over our front gardens , @entity16 was creating a second @entity231			0
@entity186 died a few years ago , so now the tortoises and several pet dogs are @entity16 ’s companions			2
i asked him if he ’s ever been lonely			2
‘ yes , only once in my life - when i was living in a bedsit in @entity238			2
i was miserable then , but never here			0
’ @entity16 is not a recluse			0
he relishes visitors and company , and regrets not marrying			0
‘ but how could i ask anyone to live out here ? ’ he said			0
‘ we did n’t have running water for years ! ’ though his mother always refused to visit @entity8 because she did n’t much like ‘ abroad ’ , @entity16 ’s sister @entity246 moved to @entity68 with her husband and opened a cafe			1
and when his father @entity250 was widowed in 1981 , he accepted @entity16 ’s invitation to come and live on @entity8			1
new home : @entity16 makes himself at home on @entity8 shortly after he ' moved in ' in 1962 ‘ to my surprise , he moved from @entity255 in @entity256 to be with me when he was 88 , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ we had a wonderful time together , and became the best of friends			0
’ @entity250 died following a fall five years later and is buried on the island next to a grave @entity16 has already dug for himself			1
even now , he is not alone			0
day - trippers are allowed to visit from @entity68 for £ 10 each			1
@entity16 has a strict rule that no one is allowed to stay overnight , but some visitors try to linger a little longer			0
a @entity266 prince once offered him a blank cheque for @entity8 , and other rich visitors have also been so entranced they ’ve tried to buy it on the spot			1
but @entity16 certainly is n’t selling			0
‘ the only reason someone would want to buy this island is to build a big hotel , ’ he said			0
yes , of course he wants to keep his hideaway pristine , but perhaps he still has hopes of finding the pirate treasure rumoured to be buried somewhere on the island			0
more than 200 years ago , the @entity12 were a hideaway for pirates , including the infamous @entity282 , known as @entity283 , who was hanged in @entity285 in july 1730			1
he plagued the shipping in the western @entity23 , plundering their valuable cargoes			1
his missing hoards of treasure , including the fabled @entity291 @entity290 of @entity292 encrusted with diamonds and rubies , were buried on islands in the @entity12 , including @entity8			1
or at least that ’s what the stories say			0
one treasure trove is supposed to be worth more than £ 30 million			0
after buying the island , @entity16 admits he spent much of his spare time searching for the fortune , poring over old maps , hunting for clues and shifting tons of rock at two excavation sites			0
there are graves on the island that are said to be the burial sites of pirates , and @entity16 has found some evidence of man - made hiding places			1
but if he found gold , he is n’t letting on			0
he loves the pirate tales as much as anyone , and seems happy to feed the rumours with a conspiratorial nudge and a wink			0
presenter : @entity322 visits the @entity12 in next sunday 's episode of @entity23 on @entity324 but it ’s fair to say @entity16 has never been motivated by money			1
he could have taken the @entity266 prince ’s blank cheque many years ago and moved to a luxurious retirement home			0
instead he has worked tirelessly to transform and preserve @entity8 , ensuring that when he finally does leave the island it will be protected and passed to the people of the @entity12 as a protected national park			1
‘ @entity16 is the modern @entity133 , ’ says @entity334 , environment minister for the @entity12			2
‘ he ’s a naturalist , a conservationist and a damned hard worker			0
’ @entity337 boasts a glorious array of wildlife , along with 40 species of palm trees , including the exotic bwa - bannann ( known as the wood banana ) and @entity343 , or sea coconut			0
the island has been @entity16 ’s life , and as he has struggled and toiled to create a spectacular home , it has repaid him by giving him a tonic that no doctor can prescribe : a real sense of purpose and meaning			2
out in the @entity23 , @entity8 , @entity95 - born and @entity10 proud , is still living the dream .			1

sprightly 86 - year - old bought @entity12 island for £ 8,000 in 1962
when he bought @entity8 , it was overgrown with scrub so dense that coconuts could not fall to the ground
