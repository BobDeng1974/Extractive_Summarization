by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:10 est , 28 september 2013 updated : 02:00 est , 30 september 2013 @entity3 , pictured , will present @entity5 's new show @entity4 on monday they were too embarrassed to tell family and friends			1
and when they made their debut performance – having sex in front of a television audience – they were terrified they would be too nervous to go through with it			1
now @entity16 and her partner @entity18 will doubtless face a public outcry when they appear on @entity5 ’s provocative programme @entity4 , in which they have sex shrouded from view in a box in a television studio			1
the programme – from the channel which in the past faced a furore over screening a live autopsy and aired uncensored footage of penetrative sex in the movie @entity34 – is the latest offering from the broadcaster that seems determined to offend			1
‘ @entity38 was terrified he would n’t be able to do what was needed , ’ @entity16 confessed			1
‘ but i wore some sexy underwear and that seemed to do the trick			0
’ @entity16 , 39 , insisted she and @entity38 , 41 , are not exhibitionists			1
‘ we have sex as part of a normal , healthy and loving relationship , ’ she said			0
‘ i hope people will look at the programme in a positive light			1
’ but while @entity5 claims @entity4 is ‘ pushing the boundaries of @entity54 television ’ and will prompt intelligent debate at a time when an alarming 30 per cent of online traffic is to porn sites , critics have branded the show a cheap entertainment stunt			1
many have taken to @entity62 to suggest the programme is even worse than soft porn because it masquerades as a public service			1
scores have branded the notion of sex on television disgusting			2
@entity70 wrote : ‘ what the hell have we become as human beings ? ’ while @entity71 said : ‘ so there ’s a new show called @entity4 where people have sex on tv			1
sounds like porn to me			0
’ others accused the broadcaster of cynically trying to boost ratings after it was outperformed by @entity85 for the first time in its history in july			0
presented by @entity3 , the show features three couples – one of them gay – who each enter a box , and have sex for 35 minutes before emerging to talk about their experiences with psychotherapist @entity95 , sex therapist @entity96 and relationship expert @entity97			1
couple @entity38 and @entity16 will have sex in the box , pictured left , on the show and then talk about the experience with experts			1
neither of the pair have told their parents that they are involved in the show miss @entity3 said she initially had ‘ great trepidation ’ about the show but now thinks ‘ it is a really mature look at a subject we ’ve allowed to proliferate in its worst manifestations and refuse to confront ’			0
the programme is based on the work of sex therapists who encourage couples to have sex then talk about it immediately afterwards while their feelings are vivid			2
@entity16 and @entity38 admitted there was no romantic ‘ warm - up ’ before they walked into the opaque , sound - proofed box , where they had 35 minutes to have sex before emerging to talk about it with the sex experts			1
‘ usually we ’d take a lot more than half an hour from start to finish so it was a bit stressful , ’ says @entity16			2
the couple said they were more used to spicing up their sex life with romantic weekends			0
but there were no rose petals scattered on the bed in the box			0
‘ it looked like a basic room in a budget hotel , ’ said @entity16 , a mother of three			2
‘ it had a double bed , side tables with a lamp , a mini-disc player and a sink			0
it was n’t quite what we ’d expected			0
’ there is little that can be seen through the box , and only when the lights on the outside turn from red to amber do the audience get the hint that the interlude is almost over			0
@entity16 said she had been more nervous coming out of the room than going in			2
‘ we do n’t usually talk about sex after we ’ve done it and i was concerned what the experts were going to ask , ’ she says			0
‘ @entity4 can be stress relieving , it is the ultimate anti-depressant			2
sex is important to us within our relationship but not the most important thing in the world			0
’ three sets of couples will take part in the show which also features experts @entity95 , left , @entity96 , centre , and @entity97 the @entity181 was given exclusive access to the programme which discusses issues including multiple partners , myths about gay sex and uses several sexual words that justify its 10pm slot			1
producers adopt a light - hearted talk - show tone throughout			2
when @entity16 and @entity38 were approached by researchers to take part in the show , they had no idea it would involve having sex in a box			1
‘ we just thought it was going to be talking about sex , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ when they mentioned having sex , @entity38 had reservations			0
we are private people and had the feelings of the children to take into account			0
‘ i know they might get a bit of teasing but they did n’t object to it			0
we felt confident the programme was n’t going to show sex in a dirty or degrading way and i do n’t feel we have done anything to be ashamed of			1
’ the couple have not yet seen the show			0
they say they will watch it before allowing their children to see it			0
the biggest surprise is likely to be for @entity16 ’s mum , who thought the couple had gone for a romantic weekend in @entity228			2
@entity38 ’s dad has also not been told			0
‘ it might be a bit of a shock for them , ’ @entity16 said			2
@entity4 is on @entity5 on monday , october 7 at 10pm .			1

@entity16 and @entity18 will have sex in a box in a television studio
@entity5 claims @entity4 is ' pushing the boundaries of @entity54 television '
' i hope people will look at the programme in a positive light , ' ms @entity16 says
critics say the show is a cheap publicity stunt that is ' worse than soft porn '
