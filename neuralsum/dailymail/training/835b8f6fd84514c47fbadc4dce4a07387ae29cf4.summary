by @entity0 published : 04:06 est , 15 december 2012 updated : 06:39 est , 15 december 2012 a christmas tree planted by a couple in their front garden more than 30 years ago has become a village landmark as it has grown to tower above their house			1
when @entity9 , 67 , and husband @entity10 , 68 , bought the small pine tree for just £ 6 from a garden centre in 1978 they hardly expected it to be standing higher than 40ft tall 34 years later			1
the couple planted the 6ft tree outside their new home in the village of @entity19 , @entity20 , and took a photograph to commemorate the occasion			1
through the years : @entity9 and @entity23 planted the tree when it stood at just 6ft tall after moving to their new home 34 years ago standing tall : the tree now towers over the couple 's home after growing to more than 40ft tall small beginnings : the couple bought the tree for £ 6 and took a picture to commemorate the occasion but after more than 30 years of dedicated care it is still standing proud at 42 ft tall , and it is still growing			1
the tree has become so big it now towers over the couple 's home and has become a focal point for the local community			1
each year it is decorated with more than 1,000 traditional tungsten bulbs using a cherry picker loaned by a local firm			0
and for the last three years the couple have held on switch - on event which many villagers now see at the start of the festive period			2
television writer @entity9 said : ' my husband and i moved up to the village from @entity52 in 1978 for a more meaningful life			1
' we saw that the local post office had a christmas tree which was covered in fairy lights and it really stood out			2
winter wonderland : the tree has become a focal point for the village every year at @entity62 major operation : each year the tree is decorated with more than 1,000 traditional tungsten bulbs using a cherry picker loaned by a local firm ' because of our position in the village we decided to do the same thing so planted the tree when we moved in			1
' it 's safe to say we were n't expecting it to still be standing almost 40 years later , nor to have grown to such a height			0
it 's become a bit of a village landmark			0
' for the last three years we 've had a switch - on event with a fairground organ and a steam traction engine - the owner heats up mince pies in the boiler			0
' a lot of people in the village say that it 's the start of their @entity62			2
' we even get cards addressed to the tree which is quite sweet			0
' mr and mrs @entity9 used a single string of @entity62 lights to decorate the tree during the early 1980s but as it grew the couple had to buy more and more lights			1
helping hand : decorating the christmas tree in time for the festive season takes a major effort each year charity : all the effort is worth it as the couple raise money for the @entity106 and @entity107 last year they raised more than £ 1,000 for @entity106 and @entity107 , which saved @entity110 's life after he suffered a heart attack			2
this year the couple have chosen to raise money for @entity114			0
retired @entity115 editor mr @entity23 said : ' after a few years we realised the tree was growing taller and taller and getting more and more attention , so we decided we 'd like to use it to raise money for charity			1
' we are very proud of the tree and it does look incredible each year with the lights on it			0
' @entity19 is one of a handful of villages in the country which does n't have any street lights and the tree can be seen from a mile away at night when it is lit up			0
a spokesman for the @entity133 said : ' this is a remarkable tree which has obviously been taken care of			0
' pine trees can grow to huge heights so time will only tell if this one grows any larger			0
' visible : the tree can be seen for miles around when lit up as the village does n't have any street lights			2

@entity9 and @entity23 bought the tree for £ 6 in 1978
it stood at just 6ft tall when first planted at their new home 34 years ago
has now become a focal point for their village each @entity62
