back in the summer i wrote in this column that @entity3 was one of the best and most exciting signings of the transfer window and if he could recapture his teenage magic , then @entity0 would have a wonderful player			1
they 'd also have more proof for the sceptics that they 're no longer a rugby team and are changing their style			0
well on saturday i was at the @entity13 to see the former @entity15 man run the show against @entity17			1
he wanted the ball all the time , even in tight situations , rarely wasted a pass , treasured possession and created			0
he scored , he even tracked back and worked hard			0
he was head , shoulders and torso ahead of everyone else on the pitch			0
it was a joy to watch			0
i interviewed @entity0 's @entity27 this week who said that it took @entity3 a little while to settle in and adapt to the @entity31 , but that he has been brilliant in recent weeks			1
@entity27 told me : ' he 's making players better around him , he 's starting to get comfortable , he 's going to be known as our main guy , the one who makes us tick			2
' @entity0 's @entity3 has started to show why he was seen as a teenage prodigy @entity3 slips an effort beyond @entity17 goalkeeper @entity37 as @entity0 raced into a two - goal lead and it got me thinking			1
is it possible that @entity3 is on his way to becoming @entity0 's greatest ever player ? they 've had some amazing names down the years – some legends of football like @entity47 , sir @entity48 , @entity49 and sir @entity50			1
other players are true legends who will forever be in the hearts of @entity0 fans – the likes of @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , who all played with the @entity61 when they won their only major honour to date , the @entity63 in 1972			2
@entity48 is probably the no 1			0
he was starring for the club when they enjoyed their highest ever league placing of fourth , and was still with them when they matched it a few years later			0
he trebled the crowd when he returned to @entity0 in 1961 and played for the club at the age of 50 – incredible			2
sir @entity48 ( pictured playing in his testimonial match in 1965 ) is @entity0 's greatest player ever the winger ( beating @entity74 's @entity73 in 1963 ) dazzled for the @entity61 over two spells @entity59 ( centre ) and @entity78 parade the @entity63 at @entity79 back in 1972 there will be few players who have worn the @entity0 shirt and had more technical ability than @entity3 but he needs to show that ability and apply it in matches successfully over a period of time			1
it does n't have to be a very long time – @entity89 is considered a @entity0 legend by many fans despite only spending just over two years at the club			2
to be the greatest @entity0 player ever , @entity3 also has to make a major contribution to them winning a trophy			1
they came close in 2011 when they lost 1 - 0 to @entity99 in the @entity101 final			0
but that 1972 @entity79 win over @entity74 remains their greatest day			0
@entity104 's @entity103 - winning goalkeeper @entity47 played at @entity0 for five years at 24 , @entity3 has time to make himself a @entity0 legend			1
but he is also young enough to catch the eye of clubs around @entity108 and re-establish himself on the big stage			0
make no mistake , the @entity111 international has had @entity0 fans on the edge of their seats in recent weeks			2
as his impact grows , he will be man - marked and kicked			0
if he can cope with all that , he will be one of the stars of the @entity31 this season			2
if he takes the club to another level , and a major trophy , then he could become @entity0 's greatest ever player			1
and if @entity48 were alive to watch @entity3 's style and class at the @entity13 , i 'm sure he 'd give his blessing .			1

@entity3 was the *standout* as @entity0 *humbled* @entity17 in the @entity31
the former @entity15 man could become a @entity0 great
@entity3 is beginning to show why he was revered as a teenager
if he helps them to a trophy he *'ll* be @entity0 's best player ever
