everyone knows that eating a supersize pizza , bulging burger or ice cream sundae is bad for you			0
but now scientists have warned that bingeing on junk food on a regular basis can scar a person 's dna			2
the new research poses the possibility for bad diets and unhealthy eating habits to be passed on to the next generation			1
the study , published in @entity16 , found that eating fast food can lead to a greater risk of cancer , inflammation , infections and allergic reactions			1
a new study has revealed that binging on junk food , such as fatty burgers ( pictured ) on a regular basis scars our dna and can lead to a greater risk of cancer , inflammation , infections and allergic reactions and worse still , if a poor diet of junk food becomes a regular habit , the dietary choices become encoded in dna and damage the gut ’s microbiome , or environment , too , @entity38 reported			1
‘ our bodies are a kind of mini-ecosystem and anything that disturbs our bacteria can alter our health in profound ways , ’ @entity39 of the @entity40 in @entity41 , told @entity42			2
if a poor diet of junk food becomes a regular habit , the dietary choices become encoded in dna , scientists said the study suggests that food choices permanently change the balance of bacteria in the gut and can weaken the immune system			1
he explained that the @entity61 diet is particularly bad at upsetting people ’s immune systems and guts and could even potentially lead to more people suffering from auto immune diseases			1
the study says : ‘ [ it ] appears unlikely that synthetic supplements or probiotics will be able to fully counterbalance the damage of our dietary choices , let alone undo them , if they are not accompanied by lifestyle modifications			0
‘ of potentially greatest concern , our poor dietary behaviours are encoded into both our @entity27 scaffolding and gut microbiome and thus these harmful immune modifications are passed to our offspring during their most critical developmental window			0
' previous research has shown that the bacteria in the gut adapts to suit a person ’s diet			0
the scientists have now found that there are adjustments in both the types of bacteria found and their gene expressions			0
dr @entity39 advises that people should cut out sugar and fat in processed from their diets and instead focus on fresh sources of protein – and fat – such as fish and meat .			0
