by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 14 april 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 15 april 2013 @entity1 : the election means he can carry on for another five years until 2018 @entity1 , the militant trade union leader who is calling for a general strike , won re-election yesterday despite winning the backing of just 10 per cent of his members			1
@entity7 , as he has been dubbed , reinforced his iron grip on @entity9 – the country ’s biggest union – by winning 64 per cent of the votes cast			1
but in a dismal example of union democracy , just 15 per cent of the membership bothered to fill in a ballot			1
the election means mr @entity1 can carry on rabble rousing for another five years until 2018			1
just last week he was arguing for an ‘ explicitly political strike ’ across the trade union movement , which would be the first general strike since 1926			2
mr @entity1 ’s re-election is a headache for @entity23 , who has been unable to shake off the stigma of being picked by the unions contrary to the wishes of both @entity28 members and mps			2
unite have donated £ 8,425,166 to the @entity28 since mr @entity23 became leader in september 2010			0
@entity9 remains @entity28 ’s single biggest donor , giving 32 per cent of donations in the last quarter			1
the vote comes as @entity35 , the new head of the @entity37 , resurrected fears of 1970s and 1980s style militancy by refusing to back key union reforms that were introduced by the @entity42 government			2
asked whether she supports secret ballots on strike action and the ban on closed shop , she flatly refused to do either			0
she added : ‘ i ’m not interested in re-running battles of the 70s but sorting out the mess that we ’ve had as a result of unions being marginalised in society			0
’ mrs @entity35 then made the extraordinary claim that ‘ nobody took anybody out on strike without there being strong support , so i think it ’s insulting to ordinary men and women to suggest otherwise ’			0
in fact , @entity64 ’s failure to hold a secret strike ballot is widely regarded as fatally undermining whatever public support there was for the miners ’ strike in 1984 - 85			0
unite have donated £ 8,425,166 to the @entity28 since mr @entity23 ( left ) became leader in september 2010			0
the vote comes as @entity35 ( right ) , the new head of the @entity37 , resurrected fears of militancy but her intervention suggests even the usually cautious @entity37 is heading down a path of militancy			0
yesterday mr @entity1 said he was ‘ deeply honoured that members have once again put their faith in me to lead their union ’ and promptly vowed to bring down the government			1
@entity84 chairman @entity83 cast doubt on mr @entity1 ’s credibility having won such a small number of votes			1
he said : ‘ @entity89 baron @entity1 ’s been re-installed with the support of only a fraction of his membership , while @entity35 wants to take us back to the bad old days of strikes without ballot			1
‘ we ’re transforming the economy and removing 2.2million of the lowest paid workers from tax altogether – still , these union bosses remain completely unreformed			0
’ he said mr @entity1 ’s re-election ‘ ensures @entity23 will remain clueless about dealing with the deficit ’ .			2

@entity1 won 64 per cent of the votes cast reinforcing his grip on the union @entity9
but only 15 per cent of the membership filled in a ballot
