with five children already and another on the way , @entity0 , a 30 - year - old full time mother from the @entity3 's @entity2 province , was looking forward to meeting her new baby			1
like other @entity3 mothers , she had booked into the local hospital for the birth and had saved up to pay for the services of a midwife			2
but things did n't go to plan and as a result , @entity0 has spent months imprisoned in hospital , her newborn baby with her - all because she did n't have the £ 35 needed to pay for the emergency caesarian she was forced to have			1
prisoner : @entity0 was told she could n't leave hospital after giving birth until she paid for her caesarean speaking to @entity22 , she explained : ' i came into the hospital on 2nd november to give birth to my sixth child , but there were complications			1
' my child is out of danger now - he has no health problems			0
but i am still in the hospital because i do n't have the money to pay for the operation i had to have because of the birth complications			1
' i have to pay to leave the maternity ward and i do n't have the money			1
i had saved up the money to pay for a normal birth but the complications meant that the birth cost more – now i owe 53,000 @entity3 francs ( £ 35 ) and i do n't have the money to pay that			1
' when it came time to go home , the nurses asked me for the money and i had to tell them that i did n't have it			2
that 's why i 'm still here – the nurses did n't want to let me leave			2
' shockingly , @entity0 's story is far from unique as one of her doctors , @entity51 , confessed			2
fees : in the @entity55 health services rely on charging patients fees ( file photo ) ' there are five women in this hospital at this point who are in the same situation , although one of these lost her child during the birth , ' she explains , adding : ' i do n't think it costs the hospital any more to keep them here			1
' asked about @entity0 , @entity51 insisted that she and fellow doctors are right to hold her prisoner in hospital and said that if they had let @entity0 have the caesarian for nothing , they would be forced to do the same for other patients			1
' this woman 's wound has already healed so she has no need to stay in hospital any longer , ' she explained			0
' she is only here because she does n't have the money needed to allow her to leave			1
' we have guards on the door to ensure patients who are n't supposed to leave do n't do so without permission			2
' there 's only one door out and there are two sentries guarding it			0
they are very vigilant : the security is very tight , people ca n't escape			0
no escape : doctor @entity51 said there were five other mothers imprisoned in the hospital ( file photo ) ' it is a somewhat difficult situation , because if we take responsibility for this woman then all the others will want us to do the same for them , and if we do n't it will be showing a kind of favouritism – as if we preferred to help one woman rather than others			1
' the @entity3 is one of the toughest places for children to be born according to women and children 's charity , @entity117			0
according to their figures , the child mortality rate in the @entity120 country is as high as 146 per 1,000 live births while the newborn mortality rate is 44 per 1,000			0
by contrast , just five in every 1,000 @entity126 children dies before the age of five			0
and while @entity126 mothers can give birth for nothing , the @entity3 has no public healthcare system and as a result , less than 25 per cent of the population has access to a functional health service that they can afford to use			0
commenting on @entity0 's story @entity138 , @entity117 ceo said every mother should have the right to free care in labour and has called on @entity145 and other world leaders to take action			0
problems : @entity0 's experience is compounded by years of fighting which has wrecked infrastructure dangerous : fighting has forced many to flee while making life precarious for those who remained behind he said : ' no mother should be kept hostage because she is unable to pay for the emergency care that saved her life and that of her newborn child			1
' it 's a scandal and every mother – no matter where she lives in the world - should have access to a midwife and free care when she needs it the most			0
' @entity0 's story shows just why it is important for countries to step up and put the health of their mothers and newborn babies first			0
' as for @entity0 herself , being released from hospital remains a distant dream			1
alone after her husband returned home to care for their other children and raise the money needed to free her , @entity0 says she has no idea when she will finally be released			1
' i do n't have family who can help me and there is no other way for me to leave the hospital other than paying what i owe , ' she admits			2
' it 's just the operation i need to pay for - they are n't trying to charge me for the extra days i 've had to stay			0
' i am allowed to have visitors but i 'm not allowed out of the hospital			0
i do n't know how long i 'll be here : i just have to wait until my husband finds the money			2
