by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 16:18 est , 14 march 2014 an @entity3 diplomat was re-indicted today on @entity5 visa fraud charges that touched off an international furore after she was arrested and strip - searched last year			1
the new indictment , filed on friday , essentially just reinstates recently - dismissed charges against the diplomat @entity9 - charges that now arrive with her out of the country			1
a judge threw out last year 's virtually identical indictment on wednesday on diplomatic immunity grounds , but the ruling left a door open to reviving the case and federal prosecutors quickly suggested they would			0
it accuses @entity9 of lying to the @entity5 government to get her housekeeper a work visa			2
he said on wednesday that re-indicting his client ' might be viewed an aggressive act and one that ( prosecutors ) would be ill - advised to pursue '			0
@entity9 is back in @entity3			1
there was no immediate response to messages left at @entity3 's embassy in @entity35 and consulate in @entity37			2
it 's unclear when , if ever , she might appear in court in @entity37 again			0
it 's unlikely she would ever be forced to appear through extradition			0
the @entity43 had filed court papers opposing @entity9 's bid to get the charges dismissed and stands by it , @entity43 spokeswoman @entity42 told reporters friday in @entity35			1
@entity9 was a deputy consul general in @entity37 when she was arrested in december near her children 's @entity51 school			2
prosecutors say she told the government she was paying her @entity3 housekeeper $ 4,500 per month while actually paying her less than $ 3 per hour and often making her work up to 100 hours a week			2
' @entity9 did not want to pay the victim the required wages under law or provide the victim with other protections against exploitative work conditions mandated by @entity5 law , ' the indictment says			1
in the initial case , she pleaded not guilty and argued she was immune from prosecution			0
@entity67 , the husband of housekeeper @entity68 ( pictured ) , filed a court petition in @entity70 last year saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat @entity9 the arrest sparked an outcry in @entity3 , particularly because of the strip - search			1
the @entity76 said @entity9 was treated no differently than others who are arrested , and @entity5 attorney @entity78 said she indeed was afforded courtesies most @entity5 would n't get , such as being allowed to make phone calls for two hours to arrange child care and sort out personal matters			0
@entity78 , who is himself @entity3 - born , also said @entity9 was n't handcuffed , restrained or arrested in front of her children and was given coffee and offered food while detained			1
and he questioned why there was such a furor over what @entity9 experienced but ' precious little outrage ' over how the housekeeper was allegedly treated			0
still , many in @entity3 saw the arrest as deeply disrespectful			0
@entity3 officials also said the housekeeper , @entity68 , had tried to blackmail the diplomat ; @entity67 's advocates disputed that			1
@entity98 , an anti-human - trafficking group that represents @entity67 , said earlier this week it hoped @entity9 would face a new indictment , calling the case ' a tremendous opportunity to demonstrate our nation 's commitment to fighting exploitation of workers '			1
the arrest roiled @entity5 - @entity3 relations , with @entity3 taking such steps as removing concrete traffic barriers around the @entity111 and revoking diplomats ' id cards			1
after being indicted , @entity9 complied with a @entity43 request to leave the @entity5 , and the @entity3 government then asked @entity35 to withdraw a diplomat from the @entity111 in @entity70			1
@entity9 was charged with visa fraud and making false statements			0
she faces prosecution if she returns to the @entity120 when @entity9 was arrested , @entity5 officials said her status as a consular officer provided immunity limited to acts performed in the exercise of official functions			0
then , on the day before her jan. 9 indictment , she was accredited to @entity3 's @entity130 mission , a role that conferred wider immunity			2
@entity5 district judge @entity133 decided in a ruling wednesday that the later appointment gave @entity137 immunity when indicted and meant that indictment had to be dismissed , without settling the question of whether the alleged crimes would have been considered " official acts " covered by the earlier , more limited immunity			0
but the judge wrote that there was ' no bar to a new indictment against @entity9 ' , whose immunity ended when she left the country			2
she still works in foreign affairs for the @entity3 government , but now in @entity70 , according to @entity26 .			0

the new indictment , filed on friday , essentially reinstates recently - dismissed charges against the diplomat @entity9
@entity9 is back in @entity3 and extradition appears unlikely
