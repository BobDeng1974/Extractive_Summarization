senators say sgt @entity1 did not ‘ look good ’ in proof - of - life video that they were shown at a meeting last night and may have been ‘ drugged ’ but did not appear to be near - death like the @entity6 administration claimed			1
‘ it appeared that he was drugged , and that he was barely responsive in the video itself , ’ @entity8 vice-chairman @entity7 , a @entity9 , told reporters on wednesday			0
‘ i do n’t think from a health standpoint there was any issue that dictated the release of these five nasty killers in exchange for @entity1 , ’ he added			2
many came away feeling the video still did not justify ignoring @entity27 in making the trade ' proof ' ? sen. @entity30 was among those shown the 1 1/2 minute long video - believed to have been filmed in december - at a briefing with @entity34 and intelligence officials at the @entity36 last night ‘ that did not sell me at all			1
the proof of life was basically five months ago			2
december ? at that time he was impaired , ’ @entity38 sen. @entity37 told @entity39			0
‘ that is not the person that was released here			0
he was not in that type of dire situation when he was released			0
’ the terms of the trade for @entity1 , coupled with stories from former platoon - mates of the soldier ’s erratic behavior in the days leading up to his capture and remarks about wanting to desert the army , have had the @entity6 administration on defense since the president announced last saturday that @entity1 had been released			1
whatever the reason @entity1 wandered off base alone , the @entity23 has a commitment to rescue its men and women in uniform , the president and other administration officials have repeatedly said			1
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure that we get back a young man to his parents and that the @entity23 people understand that this is somebody ’s child , and that we do n’t condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back , ' president @entity6 said today during a press conference at the @entity81 in @entity82			1
and when the @entity86 provided evidence that @entity1 ’s health was deteriorating , cabinet - level officials made a ‘ unanimous ’ decision to strike a deal , secretary of defense @entity83 said today			1
‘ it was our judgment based on the information that we had that his life , his health were in peril , ’ @entity91 told @entity92 in an interview that aired this morning			0
however , a close friend of @entity1 ’s parents , @entity100 and @entity101 , told @entity104 that ‘ @entity100 has n’t said anything about @entity1 ’s health			2
' deserter ' : senior dem @entity108 said @entity1 's release ( exchange caught on video above ) in the swap with five @entity86 prisoners held at @entity115 put @entity23 at risk all around the world anger : sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , center left , speaks with sen. @entity122 , @entity123 , as senators emerge from a closed - door briefing ‘ there was never any doubt in @entity100 and @entity101 ’s minds that @entity1 was coming home , they have been the most resilient people i have ever met , ’ said @entity126 , owner of the bike shop where @entity128 works			1
‘ but they have never mentioned any medical concerns			0
’ members of the @entity137 were shown a classified 1 1/2 minute long video at a briefing with @entity34 and intelligence officials at the @entity36 last night that was supposed to prove @entity1 was deathly ill when the president and his cabinet decided to rescue him without consulting @entity27			1
but last night ’s meeting did little to satisfy the concerns of the lawmakers , who say they still have unanswered questions about the trade			2
‘ there ’s a lot to be answered here and there ’s a lot of peculiar behavior that ’s gone on between the family , this solider and his actions , ’ sen. @entity37 said on wednesday			0
‘ we all agree that we ’re not dealing with a war hero , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re dealing with a soldier who should be looked in more extensively			0
’ the executive branch is required to let members of @entity27 know 30 days in advance when it is going to release prisoners from the government ’s detention facility in @entity168 , @entity169			1
in this case , it gave lawmakers only hours notice or no notice at all that it was planning to release five detainees with ties to the @entity86			1
‘ i do n’t see how anybody can walk out of there with any kind of comfortable feeling that the administration from a notification standpoint , and i emphasize that , did what they should have done or what they had the opportunity to do			0
i mean , it was like they did n’t trust @entity22 [ @entity191 ] and me , ’ @entity7 told @entity188 ’ @entity189 after the meeting			0
all in : defense secretary @entity83 ( pictured with with sailors aboard the @entity193 during his visit to @entity195 today ) said the @entity196 had been unanimous in its decision to free @entity1 @entity7 told reporters earlier this week that he did n’t find out about the trade until it had already happened			1
the @entity196 has since apologized to @entity7 and @entity201 chairwoman @entity22 , a @entity38 , for failing to notify them of the swap in a timely manner , calling the mistake an ‘ oversight			2
’ @entity7 said on wednesday that it ’s too little too late , though			0
‘ my comment back to the administration is that i ’m not going to believe anything they tell me from now on , ’ @entity7 said			0
‘ they are willing to violate the law but even short of that , when they commit to us that they are going to give us 30 days ’ notice and then they do n’t do it , how in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us ? ’ senators from both parties said they are still worried that the @entity86 associates released from prison by the @entity196 are a threat to national security			1
‘ we have a 29 percent re-engagement rate from @entity115 and i would argue that the conditions upon which these five detainees will be held is a real troubling aspect of this whole thing because four of them , at least , are very high - level members of the @entity86 , ’ @entity231 sen. @entity230 , a @entity9 , told @entity39 on wednesday night			1
‘ these are all high - level people			0
this is not low level , ’ @entity37 said			0
‘ these are people who basically have the ability to go back and hit the ground running , and we ’re concerned about that			0
’ in releasing ‘ five of the most dangerous individuals in @entity115 , if not the five most dangerous , ’ @entity250 sen. @entity249 said , ‘ the president has now set a precedent that will encourage enemies of the @entity23 to target @entity23 men and women in uniform , to capture them in order to carry out some other exchange in the future			1
’ @entity261 sen. @entity260 , a @entity9 , admitted to @entity188 that @entity1 did not ‘ look good ’ in the classified video lawmakers were shown			1
‘ but there will be hell to pay if we find [ the @entity86 fighters ] go on to kill @entity23 , ’ he said			2
the meeting came after a tumultuous day on @entity268 when @entity38 joined the ranks of those expressing their anger over the swap			2
senior @entity272 congressman @entity108 said it was a ' dangerous precedent ' that put the lives of @entity23 around the world at risk			2
putting on a brave face : @entity6 , pictured at the meeting of the @entity81 in @entity82 overnight , has been taken aback by the level of discontent over the trade the @entity196 is not in session this week , so lawmakers from the legislative branch ’s other chamber have not yet had the opportunity to quiz administration officials			1
members of the @entity289 will have their shot at questioning secretary of defense @entity91 at a hearing next week .			0

senators shown a video sent to the @entity23 by the @entity86 in *january* that administration says forced them to *override* intelligence concerns and swap @entity1 for five @entity86 detainees in @entity115
claims to show @entity1 in ill health and it was *feared* he would die
but lawmakers at secret meeting last night who were shown the video left *unconvinced* that it showed him on the verge of death
senators said he ' did not look good ' but not near death
lawmakers outraged they were not consulted - a law signed by @entity6 six months ago says president must give them 30 days notice before a prisoner is freed from @entity115
