by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:54 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:45 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : the rule was brought in after the murder of @entity6 , pictured , who went missing when she was eight years old around five families a week are being told by police about a paedophile who has contact with their children			1
more than 700 child sex attackers have been unmasked using @entity3 – which was brought in after the murder of eight - year - old @entity6 by @entity15			1
the rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend , or a neighbour , who has contact with a child , has a history of child sex offending			1
since the law came into force in april 2011 , police in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have received some 4,754 applications from anxious parents and grandparents			1
of those , a total of 708 - around one in seven - resulted in disclosures			2
applications have fallen since the scheme was launched , from 1,944 in 2011/2012 to 1,106 so far this year			1
disclosures have also declined from 281 in the first year to 122 in the year to april 2013			2
@entity41 , director of research and development at @entity43 , a charity which works with sexual abusers as well as victims , said : ‘ while the number of applications being made is small , at 4,754 over two and half years , the conversion rate of one in seven applications resulting in a disclosure is encouraging			1
‘ it shows that adults can and do notice worrying behaviour in others around them - a key factor in keeping children safe			1
‘ our concern here would be the other six out of seven people who made an application but did not get a disclosure			0
‘ the police know of only a proportion of offenders - many have not been caught and are not on any police database			0
' for members of the public to make an application to police they must have had some concerns in the first place			0
’ since the scheme began , @entity76 and @entity77 have revealed the highest number of paedophiles at 42 , followed by @entity81 and @entity82 with 39 , @entity83 with 36 and @entity84 with 33			0
a total of 49 identities have been released in @entity28			0
it was introduced after a campaign by @entity6 ’s mother , @entity89			1
her daughter ’s body was found in a field near @entity93 , @entity94 in july 2000			0
campaign : @entity6 's mother , called @entity89 , fought hard to have the new law introduced the scheme is a watered - down version of similar laws in the @entity101 under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised			1
last year , doubts on the future effectiveness of the scheme were raised after a @entity109 ruling said sex offenders ’ human rights to privacy should be considered when dealing with applications			2
in a judgement that lawyers said risked ‘ watering down ’ the law , the court ruled in october 2012 that offenders should be given a say before their presence is disclosed			0
@entity121 , @entity123 lead for tackling sexual abuse , said : ‘ @entity125 is not a silver bullet to end child abuse and giving the public information about where sex offenders live is just one part of the jigsaw			0
‘ it ’s vital sex offenders serve long prison sentences , and like parents , we of course believe prison is the best place for those who harm children			2
‘ but all prisoners are released eventually so sex offenders must be thoroughly risk assessed and given therapy so they understand what they have done is wrong before they are released			0
and then they must be monitored closely by the authorities for a long time			0

rule allows parents to check *backgrounds* of men with *access* to children
it is named after @entity6 , an eight - year - old who was murdered
4,754 applications have been made under the law
of these around one in seven was granted
