he said : ' it was love at first sight for me			0
i always knew she was the one and i wanted to make sure the proposal was extra special			2
' lots of people propose at restaurants so i just thought it would be great to do it at the cinema where a video could be played on the screen and she would be completely surprised			1
@entity6 created a video showcasing pictures of their time together followed by the words ' @entity51 have a question for you ' that was played at the end of the trailers of @entity56 7 the film included pictures from their time together in @entity12 , 2013 , where the couple met ' it was absolutely amazing and i am so glad she said yes			1
' the pair met while @entity17 was backpacking around @entity63 , ending up in @entity12 , and @entity6 was working in the country			1
@entity17 says she had no idea that @entity6 was planning to propose - especially not in the cinema			1
she said : ' the trailers finished and these pictures of @entity12 started to play			2
' i thought it must be an advert at first but the song was one we were introduced to over in @entity12 and it is not well known over here - they would n't have used it on an advert			0
' pretty soon @entity17 , a deputy manager at a dental practice , clicked that there was something suspicious about the ' advert '			2
@entity6 has lived with @entity17 , pictured together , in @entity31 , @entity26 , since last year the pair are both big film fans so the cinema acted as the perfect location for the proposal ' the pictures kept playing and i began thinking to myself they looked familiar			1
' the next thing i know it was a giant picture of myself and then a picture of us as a couple			0
' that 's when i thought " oh my @entity95 " - i was over whelmed			0
he got on one knee and everyone started clapping			0
' @entity6 , a hospital record clerk , had been planning the event for two months , talking to @entity17 's parents , the cinema , friends and colleagues			2
the proposal took meticulous planning with @entity6 waiting until he was alone to make the film so that @entity17 would n't notice			1
despite the pair being massive film buffs @entity17 was too excited to stay and watch the rest of the film , but says it was the perfect proposal			1
although @entity17 loved the proposal she says she does n't rate @entity56 ' i thought it was amazing			1
i have a love for films myself			0
we share that , both having a passion for films			0
' for him to do it like that meant a lot			0
although it was n't personal in terms of people being there , it was personal to me , because of the way he did it			0
' although @entity17 was completely overjoyed by the proposal she admits that @entity6 's choice of film was questionable			1
' the fact that the cinema let us do it was amazing			0
there is no connection to the film though really , it was just what was showing at the time			2
' i would n't rate @entity56 in my top 10			0
it was a big film though and completely sold out			2
