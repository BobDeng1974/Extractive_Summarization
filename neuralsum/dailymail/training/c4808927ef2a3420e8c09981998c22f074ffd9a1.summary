what a difference 90 minutes can make			0
@entity2 headed in to friday night 's live tv game at @entity4 looking to avoid a fifth straight defeat			1
but they left @entity7 dreaming of automatic promotion having put in one of the finest team performances in the championship so far this season			0
@entity13 ( right ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring his second goal against @entity4 add to that some favourable results on saturday and the @entity17 find themselves occupying the final play - off position , just five points off @entity20 in second			1
the contrast between the run leading up to friday night and the thumping 5 - 0 win rather aptly sums up the rollercoaster ride at @entity27 since the @entity29 family took over			1
after a slow start to the 2012 - 13 season , @entity30 's @entity17 were the best team in the @entity11 in the second half of that campaign			2
they really should have got promoted but froze on the big stage ; first narrowly losing out to @entity36 for automatic promotion , then being beaten by @entity38 in the play - off final			2
@entity13 prods the ball beyond @entity4 keeper @entity41 at @entity7 during @entity2 's 5 - 0 win early last season , @entity30 left the club having failed to recapture the form of his debut campaign and in came @entity47			1
@entity47 could only achieve a 13th - placed finish last season and he is one of three managers to have left the club already this campaign , with @entity52 and @entity53 also coming and going			0
before friday night , @entity54 looked to be on the brink of becoming the fourth boss to go but the emphatic win has not only given him time , but should have raised confidence levels to the heights they were at in the spring of 2013			2
@entity30 's stamp is still very much on this @entity2 side , who still use the fluid 3 - 5 - 2 system he brought in so effectively			1
@entity17 boss @entity54 has got his side back on track after a poor run of form how much @entity2 's system is defined by the fact parent club @entity71 have been 3 - 5 - 2 stalwarts for decades is another matter , but if it keeps working as it did on friday night , no one at @entity27 will be complaining			1
it was a performance of genuine @entity79 quality			0
the midfield trio of @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 - as excellent at @entity7 as he was as @entity2 's creator - in - chief under @entity30 - look like they would be at ease in the top flight			2
@entity13 and @entity87 were the best strikeforce in the @entity11 two years ago and given their ages - 26 and 22 respectively - there is no reason they ca n't be again this season			0
@entity95 international @entity94 offers blistering pace out wide and while the defence is still a concern , the experience of goalkeeper @entity100 and centre back @entity101 may prove invaluable - especially if the latter 's loan deal from @entity104 can be extended beyond january			0
@entity83 runs off to celebrate scoring @entity2 's fourth goal in front of the @entity108 cameras it has been a case of one step forward under @entity30 , then two steps back in the year since his departure as the club has become something of a laughing stock			2
but friday night 's performance was as good as , if not better , than @entity2 were playing in the winter and spring of 2012 - 13 when they were sweeping all before them			1
it was this time two years ago that @entity2 began to set the @entity11 alight			0
if they can record consecutive wins by beating struggling @entity121 at @entity27 on saturday , they may just start to believe promotion is on the cards			0
good week for ... @entity124 finally			0
it 's been a disastrous season for @entity124 , who already look all but relegated			0
saturday 's 1 - 0 win over @entity129 though , @entity134 's first since taking over and the club 's first in six , has given @entity124 a modicum of hope			2
it was made all the more sweeter for @entity134 against the club who sacked him earlier this season			0
@entity124 's @entity139 celebrates after scoring his side 's winning goal against @entity129 bad week for ... @entity142 having finished in the play - offs in consecutive seasons on their return to the second tier , the @entity144 ' most likely route out of the @entity11 looks like relegation after saturday 's 3 - 0 defeat at league leaders @entity152 left them two points adrift of safety in 22nd place			1
how much time does @entity157 have left ? @entity152 's @entity159 ( left ) scores his side 's second goal in their 3 - 0 win against @entity142 talent scout : @entity164 ( @entity165 ) what is it with @entity165 and producing talented left wingers ? @entity79 internationals @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 all came through @entity165 's academy , and 21 - year - old reach is looking increasingly like he can emulate them			1
equally capable of playing left back , reach set up two in saturday 's 5 - 1 demolition of @entity177 at the den.			1

@entity2 *thrashed* @entity4 5 - 0 at @entity7 on friday night
the @entity17 are back in the @entity11 play - off spots after a bad run
@entity54 's side look capable of achieving promotion
winger @entity164 starred in @entity165 's 5 - 1 win at @entity177
