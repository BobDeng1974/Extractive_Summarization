tributes have been pouring in for @entity1 , the front man of pop band @entity2 who died of a heart attack aged 55 in the @entity5 resort of sharm - el - sheikh yesterday			1
but while he is most remembered for his music , the man who helped bring new romantic style to the world in the 1980s is still having an impact on wardrobes - and make - up bags			1
from @entity15 's bold eyebrows to @entity17 's love of contouring and @entity20 ' wacky approach to facial jewellery , @entity1 has inspired a generation of daring @entity24 beauty fans			1
but this picture of @entity1 in 1981 , left , shows how he knew how to use contouring to full effect long before the reality tv star model @entity33 , right , has sparked a trend for dark bold eyebrows but @entity1 was already rocking the look back in 1985 , left @entity1 , pictured in 2003 , often did his own make - up and outrageous looks like this one with heavy eyeliner and blue lipstick have been copied by @entity42 , pictured in 2006 , right his more shocking looks are much copied too			1
@entity44 or @entity42 , many of the stars who have tried to make headlines with outrageous make - up have been beaten to it by @entity1			1
strange himself was no stranger to making headlines for his eye - catching looks , whether it was applying lashings of liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow to long false eye lashes			2
he pulled off contouring with aplomb to accentuate his cheekbones and make his face appear slimmer - a look that is championed by @entity17 today			1
when she , or one of the other stars to copy @entity1 , showcase a look , their legions of fans do so as well , with the result that @entity1 continues to wield enormous amounts of influence on their make - up bags - and by extension ours			1
most notable of all is the return of bold power eyebrows , which have been championed by @entity15 but rocked by the @entity2 frontman back in the @entity76 before the 22 - year - old was even born			1
princess @entity78 , who starred in @entity2 's @entity80 video , told @entity81 : ' @entity1 's passion for style and self expression is a legacy that helped shape the 80s , 90s 00s to the present day			2
his imagination and flair for dressing is something that is apparent and continues to inspire ... he became an icon and well deserved			2
' we met in the late 70s and became firm friends , then and now			0
clubs , fashion and music were our playground			0
he experimented with music , gender and art creating a fantastical vision			0
' permission to parade the most innovative looks our imaginations could conjure up at the new romantic club @entity105 may be the thing he will be most remembered for ... but his imagination did n't stop there , his love of music spurred him on to create @entity2 initially a studio project with @entity114 and @entity115 which placed him firmly in the limelight as a pioneer of electronic dance			1
he was the real deal ! ' a style icon herself , @entity78 now works as culture correspondent for @entity122 and writes for @entity123			0
@entity124 wrapped black lines across her face for her new album cover - was she inspired by @entity1 who applied make - up for a similar effect in 2013 when he attended an exhibition at the @entity131 ? the @entity2 frontman wears orange eye shadow in 2002 , left , a look @entity135 used at the @entity136 in 2011 speaking about his iconic look to @entity138 last december , he said : ' i have been lucky to work with great make - up artists @entity141 who was responsible for @entity143 's looks and did the fade to @entity146 video ; @entity147 in the @entity76 and now @entity148			1
' in the early @entity76 , at the height of the @entity150 days , i usually did my own make - up			2
i 've never used a stylist but for shows , shoots and album covers , it 's great to collaborate on the make - up			2
' nowadays , i wear less than i used to - it 's mainly sculpting using highlighter and bronzer			0
i @entity161 , and skincare			0
if i 've had a night out , i use white kohl to brighten things up a bit			0
i like naked cosmetics , eyeshadows , some lashes and pencils			0
' speaking of the legacy left by @entity1 , @entity171 , director of makeup artistry at @entity166 said : ' @entity1 epitomised the cult of the @entity173 in the early eighties			0
' he was the @entity175 , a beautiful mix of @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity180 urchin			0
he crafted the look of the underground scene , a transformation with porcelain skin , graphic lines and carved contours			0
his videos with @entity2 are constantly referenced by make - up artists today			1
' @entity1 wears an orange wig in his @entity76 heyday , left , a hairstyle singer @entity192 has used when performing in 2010 @entity1 wears blue lipstick and fake eyelashes in 2002 , left , a style @entity196 used to launch her @entity198 fashion range in 2013 @entity1 's dark , tall hairstyle , heavy make - up and defined eyebrows in this picture from 2002 , left , is replicated by @entity203 as she took to the catwalk for @entity205 last year @entity1 with a punk look in 1976 complete with facial jewellery			2
