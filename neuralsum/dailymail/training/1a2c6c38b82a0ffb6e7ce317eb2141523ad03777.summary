by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:39 pm on 5th december 2011 @entity2 has revealed the @entity3 has ' serious concerns ' about how @entity6 's parliamentary elections were run - after @entity8 monitors revealed the vote was heavily stacked in favour of prime minister @entity12 's party			1
the @entity3 secretary of state launched the attack following reports the poll was marked ' by the convergence of the state and @entity12 's @entity11 ' - and amid allegations of ballot box stuffing			1
she said , during an @entity23 summit in @entity24 , @entity25 , that her opinion mattered less than that of @entity29 voters , whom she said deserved the right to know their votes were fairly cast and counted			0
concerns : @entity2 said the @entity3 was worried about the way the @entity29 election had been conducted but she added : ' @entity29 voters deserve a full investigation of all credible reports of electoral fraud and manipulation and we hope in particular that then @entity29 authorities will take action on reports that come forward			2
' the @entity29 people , like people everywhere , deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted			0
that means they deserve free , fair , transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them			0
' and she said @entity53 was also concerned that internal @entity29 election monitors were harassed , including by cyber attacks on their web sites			1
arrest : @entity29 policemen detain a participant of a rally against ' unfair parliamentary elections ' in @entity61 today after neutral observers voiced concerns about ballot - box stuffing and other electoral malpractices preliminary results released this morning show the man who has steadily tightened his grip on the nation for nearly 12 years had suffered a humiliating setback			0
@entity12 's party has seen its majority in @entity6 's parliament weaken sharply - despite @entity8 monitors also highlighting limited political competition and a lack of fairness			1
and they said it was tainted by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulations , including serious indications of ballot box stuffing			0
voting : @entity29 prime minister @entity12 ( left ) and president @entity86 ( right ) cast their votes celebration : activists of @entity92 youth group @entity93 pictured marking the victory of @entity11 in central @entity61 today ' to me , this election was like a game in which only some players are allowed to compete , ' head of the @entity101 @entity95 said			1
@entity11 is still expected to retain its majority in the lower house and @entity12 is all but certain to win next march 's presidential election , but yesterday 's vote has badly dented his carefully groomed image			1
@entity6 results it reflected a strong public frustration with the lack of political competition , ubiquitous official corruption and the gap between rich and poor , which will pose a growing challenge to @entity12 's power			1
with about 96 per cent of precincts counted , @entity11 was leading with 49.5 per cent of the vote , @entity116 chief @entity115 said			1
he predicted that it will get 238 of the @entity121 's 450 seats , a sharp drop compared to the previous vote that landed the party a two - thirds majority in the @entity121 , allowing it to change the constitution			1
critics said that even that @entity11 performance is strongly inflated , pointing at numerous reports of ballot - stuffing and other violations			2
the nation 's only independent election watchdog has been subjected to a massive official intimidation campaign in the week before the vote and saw its website blocked by what it described as a massive cyber attack it blamed on authorities			2
@entity11 has been seen increasingly as the party of corrupt officials , and its description as a ' party of crooks and thieves ' has stuck , flashing up as the first suggestion on @entity6 's top web search engine			1
@entity12 sought to stem a quick decline in @entity11 's popularity by trying to expand its support base with a so - called @entity155 , an umbrella group for unions , professional associations , veteran groups and others			1
but the effort has brought no visible result , and @entity12 last month received a stinging blow to his own ego when he was met with catcalls after a mixed martial arts fight at a @entity61 arena			2
opposition leader @entity167 said after the vote that @entity12 's ' honeymoon ' with the nation was over			1
' he needs to hold an honest presidential election and allow opposition candidates to register for the race , if he does n't want to be booed from @entity174 to @entity175 , ' @entity167 said on @entity177 radio			0
seeing the declining fortunes of his party , @entity12 named his handpicked successor as president , @entity86 , to lead @entity11 's list			1
the vote will further weaken positions of @entity86 , whom @entity12 promised to name prime minister after the presidential vote , a move that has fuelled public irritation			2
members of election committee empty a ballot box after voting closed at a polling station today voting : @entity193 casts his ballot at home in @entity196 ( left ) as patriarch @entity197 and all @entity6 casts his ballot ( right ) a @entity200 veteran casts his vote at a boarding house for disabled and elderly people during the @entity121 elections putting a positive spin on the disappointing returns , @entity12 said late sunday that ' we can ensure the stable development of the country with this result			1
' but he appeared glum when speaking to supporters at @entity11 headquarters and limited his remarks to a terse statement			2
the @entity215 appeared to benefit most from the protest vote , with exit polls and the early returns predicting it would get nearly 20 per cent , up from less than 12 per cent four years ago			0
the socialist @entity219 and the @entity220 led by mercurial nationalist @entity221 are also expected to increase their representation in the @entity121			0
anarchy : campaigners shout and hold a banner in protest against the conduct of @entity6 's elections			0
the banner reads , ' you were cheated ' pedestrians walk past a stencilled graffiti showing @entity29 prime minister @entity12 , with the words ' @entity235 1 ' underneath near the @entity29 embassy where expatriate @entity29 voted prime minister @entity12 shakes hands with his staff and supporters among the @entity11 ruling party 's campaigners just 20 years ago , they seemed consigned to the dustbin of history - but @entity6 's communists are enjoying a new found resurgence			1
students , intellectuals , and even some businessmen voted for the @entity251 ( @entity215 ) in a bid to wound @entity12 's @entity11			1
the party , which to some may still evoke memories of elderly poor left behind a @entity6 of glitzy indulgence , doubled its vote to about 20 per cent			2
for many @entity29 disillusioned by rampant corruption and a widening gap between rich and poor , the communists represented the only credible opposition			0
through all the turmoil of the early 1990s when the @entity264 collapsed , the party kept a strong national organisation based on regions and workplace			0
with access to official media limited for the opposition , it has had a huge advantage			0
' the @entity273 are the only real party out there , ' said one @entity276 banker in @entity61			0
' @entity11 is a joke , @entity219 is a joke and the @entity220 is a joke and many people know it			2
so they vote communist because they realize it is a real vote for the opposition and against @entity11			1
this is as ironic as you get			0
' perceptions among some @entity29 that the nationalist @entity220 party and @entity219 are in the @entity289 's pocket and will vote with @entity11 in parliament also helped the communists			1
despite that , @entity12 should still have no problem getting his laws rubber - stamped			2
even the @entity273 have posed only token opposition in the outgoing @entity121 , and the two other parties have consistently voted with @entity11			2
about 60 per cent of @entity6 's 110 million registered voters cast ballots , down from 64 percent four years ago			0
only seven parties were allowed to field candidates for parliament this year , while the most vocal opposition groups were barred			0
several parties complained sunday of extensive election violations aimed at boosting @entity11 's results			1
communist leader @entity306 said his party monitors thwarted an attempt to stuff a ballot box at a @entity61 polling station where they found 300 ballots already in the box before the start of the vote and pointed at numerous other incidents of ballot - stuffing			1
@entity6 's only independent election monitoring group , @entity317 , which is funded by @entity3 and @entity8 grants , has come under heavy official pressure in the past week after @entity12 accused @entity276 governments of trying to influence the election and likened recipients of @entity276 aid to @entity324			1
@entity317 website was incapacitated by hackers on sunday , but it was still able to field more than 2,000 observers , and they reported numerous violations , director @entity329 said			0
she said many of the violations involved absentee ballots , including so - called ' cruise ' or ' carousel ' voting where people with the ballots are bussed to multiple polling stations			0
many people complained that they were forced to get absentee ballots and hand them over to their bosses			0
social media were flooded with messages reporting violations			0
many people reported seeing buses deliver groups of people to polling stations , with some of the buses carrying young men who looked like football fans			0
electoral officials visit villagers during the parliamentary election , in the western @entity29 village of @entity357 , some ( 290 miles from @entity61 yesterday			0
