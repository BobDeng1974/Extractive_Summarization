by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:33 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 04:36 est , 24 may 2013 defending response time : assistant commissioner @entity3 said the first officers were on scene within nine minutes of the 999 call police sought to defend their response to the @entity10 terror attack last night by suggesting the attackers could have laid a trap			1
commanders at @entity14 suspected the savage killers were waiting for officers to arrive so they could set off hidden explosives			1
this is why they chose to send in firearms officers who did not arrive at the scene of the carnage for 14 minutes			1
that left their uniformed colleagues to stand on the sidelines while three brave women confronted the killers			2
local officers had taken nine minutes to arrive , even though @entity10 police station was 300 yards away			1
they waited helplessly as dozens of bystanders milled around the scene of horror and traffic continued to flow			1
even after police marksmen fired shots at the terrorists , members of the public could be seen yards away			2
last night , one @entity41 source said : ‘ the unarmed officers were effectively keeping a cordon			1
both guys were wearing heavy coats and keeping a distance between us and them was a priority			2
these are the kind of tactics seen employed by @entity85 in @entity86			0
‘ detonate a bomb , wait for the emergency services to arrive and then walk in with a suicide vest			0
’ assistant commissioner @entity90 said unarmed officers arrived at @entity92 within nine minutes of the first of hundreds of 999 calls to flood into their control room			1
it is understood that among the officers was at least one armed with a taser but he was told to stand by			1
the officers radioed developments to senior staff who were able to watch the tense stand - off via a cctv camera mounted on a traffic island			1
on patrol : soldiers outside @entity109 today , just 200 yards from the murder scene army base : despite its close proximity to the scene , it appears soldiers at the barracks were unaware of the incident on wednesday afternoon tribute : two police officers rearrange flowers at the scene of the attack in @entity10 soldier : tributes were left to the victim @entity125 , who was named the day after the attack handwritten : flowers and notes were left at the scene in @entity10 in honour of the dead soldier when their armed colleagues finally arrived , witnesses described how the men suddenly aggressively ran at them			1
' @entity41 just stood there			1
it was only after shots were fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to " get back " ' eyewitness one of the men attempted to fire a revolver , which misfired and injured his hand			1
the other wielded a meat cleaver			0
several shots were fired and both men , one of whom is in a serious condition , were last night under armed guard in separate @entity152 hospitals			1
one eyewitness said : ‘ it was surreal			0
many people did not even realise what had taken place and thought it was a car crash			0
it was only after shots were fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to “ get back ”			2
’ @entity14 said it took four minutes for armed officers to be assigned and ten minutes for them to arrive			1
protest : mr @entity3 called for calm after police clashed with @entity169 members in @entity10 last night assistant commissioner @entity170 said it was a ‘ good decision ’ to wait for armed response officers to confront the men			1
he said the @entity41 expects armed officers to respond to incidents in around 12 minutes , but they can be delayed by traffic			1
' if those guys had run amok it could have been a completely different story			0
instead they stood there and effectively attempted suicide by cop ' @entity183 , @entity185 chair this figure contrasts with statistics from @entity188 which show armed officers arrive at incidents , on average , in less than four minutes			1
@entity183 , chair of the @entity185 , said the speed of armed response vehicles was a ‘ big issue ’ in @entity152 policing			2
‘ if you go back to the mid- 1980s every division had a cadre of firearms trained officers and there would be weapons kept at stations , ’ he added			2
‘ if there was an incident the inspector would assign qualified people to get a weapon and go to it			0
that was before armed response vehicles			2
' revenge attacks ' : this mosque in @entity211 was targeted the evening after the soldier was killed graffiti : a mosque more than 200 miles from the scene in @entity216 was vandalised on wednesday in custody : in a separate incident , a man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a knife and attempted arson at the @entity222 in @entity223 , @entity224 ' arvs are all well and good but they are only as effective as how quickly they can get somewhere			2
they need to be properly resourced			0
‘ the number of @entity229 going around @entity152 is not very many			0
it is a very limited resource			0
‘ if we are going to continue with it , and the other option is routine arming , it needs to be more robustly resourced			0

’ the @entity41 has between 13 and 21 armed response vehicles on patrol depending on the time of day and whether any specific risks have been identified			1
these include members of the diplomatic protection group , who patrol central @entity152 , and specialist officers from what is now called @entity255			2
@entity256 , a @entity257 member who represents @entity10 , said the police were put in ‘ difficult circumstances ’ and had to make ‘ judgment calls ’			0
@entity261 , a @entity262 politician who scrutinises the @entity41 , defended the incident response time , saying it was ‘ perfectly reasonable ’ given the complex circumstances the officers had to face			1
