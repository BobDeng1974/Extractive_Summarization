more than 102,000 flights are made every day across the world			1
to put this into perspective , a web developer has created a beautiful visualisation that simulates each of these flights on a globe			1
the flight stream visualisation does n't show real - time positions of these flights , but rather routes between major airports - and the result resembles swarms of fireflies			1
click the interactive tool below @entity18 was created by @entity20 - based web developer @entity19			1
he used data from the @entity23 database to plot the number and location of flights and airports around the world			1
the animation has been designed for desktop browsers , but mr @entity19 has also created a video for people on mobiles @entity18 was created by @entity20 - based web developer @entity19			1
he used data from the @entity23 database to plot the number and location of flights and airports around the world , which includes 59,036 routes between 3,209 airports on 531 airlines as of january 2012			1
the site was created as an ' experiment to map many of the airline flights between world airports , ' explained mr @entity19			1
tools on the site let visitors control the opacity of the individual flight tracks , change the size of the airports as well as adjust the speed of the animation			1
last year , @entity53 ( formerly known as @entity53 ) , produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations , taking a tour of the @entity59 ’s airspace , called @entity59 24			0
during the visualisation , around 7,000 flights are shown entering and leaving @entity59 airspace			2
the day starts with the bow wave of transatlantic traffic heading towards the @entity59 on organised and separated tracks			2
this is joined by traffic from @entity68 and the first waves of departures from @entity59 airports			0
traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘ trunk roads ’ , or routes , of airspace as well as the hubs around @entity77 , @entity78 and central @entity79			0
there are also visualisations of military training flights , showing @entity84 jets performing manoeuvres training off the east coast of @entity87 and near to @entity88			0
it then reveals a ‘ spider ’s web of helicopter tracks ’ originating in @entity92 , taking people and supplies to @entity98 oil and gas rigs			2
the animation has been designed for desktop browsers , but mr @entity19 has also created a video for people on mobiles to be able to view the animation			1
mr @entity19 told @entity106 the visualisation was just a hobby , and admitted that there is so much data around major airports , ' it just blurs into a mess ' , but the visualisation was fun to do and ' looks pretty			1
' the @entity59 - born developer currently works for @entity115 in @entity116 and has released the code for his flight stream design , as well as his other interactive projects , on his website			1

the visualisation then shows holding stacks over @entity77 , also known as a holding manoeuvre that is used to delay a flight from landing , but keep it within the airspace			2
this is particularly key around @entity149 , continued mr @entity150 , which provides ‘ the constant flow of traffic that makes it the world ’s busiest dual runway airport with 1,350 movements a day			2
’ at @entity149 alone , goods worth £ 133 billion were shipped in and out last year , more than the combined value of goods transiting through the @entity59 ’s two largest ports , @entity161 and @entity162			0
the tour then moves around the @entity59 to include the other major airports , @entity53 ’ two control centres in @entity166 and @entity167 , and general aviation traffic			1
there are also visualisations of military training flights , showing @entity84 jets performing training manoeuvres off the east coast of @entity87 and near to @entity88			0

‘ we hope you enjoy this insight into the complexity and beauty of a day of @entity59 air traffic and the value of airspace as the invisible infrastructure that makes it all work , ’ added mr @entity150			0
to create the video , visualisation experts from a company called 422 @entity209 combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity59 flights			1
computer artists then used specially developed software to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into luminous dots , which were accurately positioned over satellite images of @entity59 , by day and by night			0
last year , @entity53 ( formerly known as @entity53 ) , produced the third in its series of air traffic visualisations , taking a tour of the @entity59 ’s airspace , called @entity59 24			0
to create the video , experts from a company called 422 south combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity59 flights			2
computer artists then used specially developed software to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into dots @entity53 , from its control centre in @entity167 , is responsible for providing the air traffic control service to the @entity234 , which is the busiest of all @entity237 regions			2
around 80 per cent of all @entity238 passes through it			0
the firm 's @entity68 visualisation was an amalgamation of @entity59 radar data , taken on 21 june 2013 , combined with @entity68 flight plan information from 28 july last year			2

this is joined by traffic from @entity68 and the first waves of departures from @entity59 airports			0
traffic levels are then seen growing to reveal the main ‘ trunk roads ’ , or routes ( pictured ) , of airspace , as well as the hubs around @entity77 , @entity78 and central @entity79			0

the flight visualisation was created by @entity20 - based web developer @entity19
he used data from @entity23 to plot the number and location of flights and airports around the world
tools on the site let visitors control the opacity of the tracks , size of the airports and the speed of the animation
mr @entity19 said the visualisation does n't show real - time positions but rather routes between major airports
