they do say a safari trip gets you up close and personal to some of the most beautiful , and yet ferocious wild animals			0
and in this video , one family show no fear as they hand - feed a tiger from within their tour truck			2
the unusually close - up footage was captured by a lady who visited @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 with her five - year - old son earlier this month			1
there may be bars between tiger and human , but the fingers come worryingly close to the beast 's mouth the tiger eyes up his piece of raw chicken - thankfully it does n't add human to his meal there are squeals of delight as the big cat clambers on top of the vehicle , and the lady captures the whole scene on video			1
the truck accelerates on , but the tiger keeps its balance on the roof , until finally clambering off once the vehicle parks up			2
the sheer size of the tigers jaws and teeth become apparent as people began to feed raw meat to the big cat			0
the tiger peers into a packed tourist truck after dismounting from the vehicle 's roof although bars separate the animal from the tourists , the fingers come a bit too close for comfort to the giant and razor - sharp incisors			1
the @entity14 is a 25 - hectare wildlife sanctuary located in the @entity63 of the country			0
' hold on to your seats as you enter a two - hectare enclosed area aboard our customized @entity68 and experience the thrill of being chased by full - grown tigers on the loose , ' is how the park 's website chillingly describes the trek .			0

@entity78 first *jumps* onto roof of truck , and takes a ride before *leaping* off
