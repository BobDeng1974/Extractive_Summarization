@entity0 are keen to turn @entity2 's loan move from @entity3 into a permanent one			1
the @entity5 under 21 international scored a spectacular goal for @entity0 on saturday to cap their 3 - 0 win over @entity9 and has impressed during his time at the @entity12			1
@entity2 has been a key figure in @entity15 's revival which has seen @entity0 win five and draw one of their last six games , scoring 19 goals in the process and climbing to ninth in the table , ten points off the play - off positions			1
@entity0 the 22 - year - old @entity2 has enjoyed the change			1
he said : ' the manager has been very firm , he has been very organised and every one of us knows our job			0
there have been no excuses			0
' if one player does not do their job , the whole team can fall down			0
the gaffer is not scared to pick you out in the dressing room if you do not do your job and , as a player , you do not like to be picked out			0
that is a major part			0
if you are not pulling your weight , you will not play			0
everyone on the pitch wants to stay on the pitch			0
' @entity2 , who has been capped by @entity5 from @entity45 level through to @entity46 , was touted as one of the game 's best prospects but a couple of cruciate ligament injuries derailed his progress			1
@entity2 scored in @entity0 's 3 - 0 win over @entity9 on saturday with a spectacular strike however , after a loan spell at @entity56 and his stint at @entity0 , he has started to gain match sharpness and is beginning to fulfil his potential			1
@entity15 has been delighted with @entity2 's performances and wants him to be part of his ambitious project to take @entity0 into the @entity63			2
that will not be straight forward though as @entity3 manager @entity65 also			0
@entity66 is fully focused on @entity3 's relegation battle but has been kept informed of the young midfielder 's performances as he continues to weigh up the players at his disposal			2
@entity72 put great faith in youth during his time at @entity76 and @entity3 's highly - rated production line was a big pull for him when he pitched to replace @entity79			2
@entity2 is one of the players he is keen to work with and @entity72 wo n't contemplate any sale			2
@entity3 boss @entity72 rates @entity2 highly and is keen to keep the midfielder next season			1
