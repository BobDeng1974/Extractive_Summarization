leaks reported by the @entity57 and the @entity58 suggest that he will not be prosecuted , and the community is said to be preparing itself for yet more violence			0
demonstrations : @entity7 's death sparked protests and vigils in @entity3 , where riot police officers came toe - to - toe with furious activists accusing them of racial violence ' brazen ' : the family says the killing is part of a culture of discrimination			1
above , investigators , not including @entity8 , inspect @entity7 's body after the killing ' intimidation ' : the @entity7 family has also demanded that @entity4 's governor apologize for the treatment of protesters , who were met with a heavy police presence when @entity7 was shot dead on august 9 , @entity3 tore itself apart in two weeks of angry protests and looting that was met with a militarized response by the police which sparked a national debate on race relations			1
@entity91 has seen a copy of the report that @entity95 ’ family will present to the @entity25 , and it gives one of the starkest illustrations yet of the family ’s sense of injustice			1
in it , @entity7 ’s father @entity101 and his mother @entity102 speak of their anger that their son ’s dead body was left bleeding in the street for four hours			0
they write : ‘ given the history of racial tensions in the city of @entity3 , this particularly disrespectful treatment of @entity7 ’s body and callous disregard for the trauma it could cause @entity3 residents repeated and reinforced the longstanding degrading treatment of black racial minorities by an overwhelmingly white police force			1
severe : the world was shocked by the use of heavy weaponry and riot gear in response to the protests severe : ranks of armed officers faced down protesters , who were buffeted with tear gas and stun grenades ‘ not only did the abandonment of the body convey to residents that the police officer regarded the black youth as less than human , but it also illustrated the officer ’s brazen confidence that he would not be punished for such unwarranted violence ’			1
in the document @entity7 ’s family call for the immediate arrest of @entity8 , who is in hiding at an undisclosed location			1

’ @entity3 and @entity168 are currently on edge as they wait for the verdict of the grand jury amid reports that @entity174 will be made to step down , though he has denied the claims			0
meanwhile , what actually happened on that night is still disputed , with witnesses giving wildly different accounts			0
what is clear is that @entity8 stopped @entity7 and his friend @entity180 as they walked along @entity182 in @entity3 as they were heading back to @entity7 ’s house			1
@entity8 drove off , then backed up and stopped in the middle of the street to talk to them again			0
protests : thousands have taken to the streets of @entity3 in outrage over the incident response : police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations in leaked reports of his testimony to the grand jury , which is held in secret , @entity8 supposedly said that @entity7 pushed him back into his police suv as he was trying to get out and pinned him down			1
at that point @entity8 reached for his gun and fired two shots , one of which hit @entity7 , whose blood was found inside the car			2
the account did not explain why @entity8 then shot @entity7 five more times in the front as , according to some witnesses , he put his hands in the air to surrender			2
@entity7 ’s supporters are worried that @entity8 is trying to exploit the law in @entity4 which allows a police officer more leeway if they feel they are under threat			1
@entity8 ’s account also flatly contradicts that of witnesses including @entity180 , who was standing next to him at the time			0
@entity180 has said that @entity8 was the aggressor and grabbed @entity7 's throat before pulling out his gun and threatening to shoot			2
another witness , whose name has been withheld , has also reportedly told the grand jury that @entity7 did not have his hands above his head when @entity8 shot him but instead they were ' out to his sides			2
' he also said @entity7 ' staggered toward @entity8 despite commands to stop ' and that ' the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired			0
' in addition to the grand jury , a separate federal prosecution into @entity7 ’s shooting was started by former attorney general @entity241 - but reportedly has too little evidence to take @entity8 to court			0
@entity7 ’s parents ' trip to @entity48 is being sponsored by the @entity246 , a nonprofit organization			2
according to the @entity3 to @entity48 official website , ‘ the goal of this trip is not only to achieve justice in @entity3 , but is intended to unite governments around the world against the human rights violations that result from racial profiling and police violence			2
