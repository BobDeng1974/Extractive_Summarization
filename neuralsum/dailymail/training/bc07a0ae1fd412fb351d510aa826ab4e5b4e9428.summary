as @entity1 erupted and victory became reality , @entity0 punched the air and permitted himself a rare smile			1
he then acknowledged his debt to the principal architect of @entity9 ’s triumph by reaching across to embrace the forwards coach @entity10			2
it was a generous gesture , and it told the tale of a revealing afternoon			0
to watch @entity9 on saturday was to see the years roll away , back to those initial days of @entity14 ’s stewardship , when success was frequently delivered through attrition			1
back even to the @entity18 side of the early nineties , when the pack called all the shots and the ball used to blink whenever it was exposed to daylight			2
the game has changed beyond recognition since those narrow - eyed eras , but @entity28 ’s @entity9 are keeping their memory alive			1
@entity30 gives out a scream of joy after barrelling over the line to score @entity9 's first try of the match @entity0 ( second right ) celebrates with coaches ( from left ) @entity37 , @entity10 and @entity38 after @entity9 beat @entity39 to win the @entity40			1
@entity0 praised @entity10 's contribution to the win @entity9 's scrum was thoroughly dominant in the victory over @entity39 on saturday at @entity1 seeking @entity46 indications at 10 - months ’ range is a foolish exercise ; one might as well turn to tea - leaves or tarot cards			1
but it seems as if @entity0 and his assistants have decided that pragmatism will rule and muscularity is the only way to go			2
you could sense as much in @entity28 ’s slightly defensive demeanour on saturday night whenever strategic issues were raised			0
he spoke of @entity9 playing ‘ intelligently ’ , of playing a ‘ smarter ’ game			1
he paid tribute to the work @entity10 and the forwards had done , how they ‘ created the platform ’			0
he mentioned the way the team had played in ‘ the right areas of the field ’ and repeated three or four times his prepared statistics on the number of tries scored by @entity9 ’s backs			1
he was wary , conscious that his methods would not meet universal approval			0
no matter ; that appears to be the way that @entity9 have elected to play			1
all other options have been tentatively tried and regretfully ditched			0
and if purists are not enthralled by the performance , then @entity28 will lose no sleep			0
and yet ... it seems a shame , an admission that @entity9 can not compete with the world ’s best on attractive terms			1
the number eight breaks an attempted @entity86 tackle to surge towards the line before the first of his tries @entity91 ( centre ) celebrates victory with props @entity95 ( left ) and @entity96 it is difficult to imagine @entity9 living with @entity99 by placing all their faith in their pack			1
and as for @entity103 , they have already demonstrated in the opening autumn international that they can accommodate any approach @entity9 decide to take			1
they will not be intimidated at the front , nor outwitted at the back			0
indeed , with a developing @entity110 and a rejuvenated @entity39 to be faced early on , blinkered intensity may not be sufficient to lift @entity9 out of the group			1
in fairness , @entity9 executed their narrow plan with stern efficiency			2
@entity115 set a soaring standard of high technique and fervent commitment , @entity91 performed quite brilliantly at the breakdown , while @entity30 , whether carrying the ball or laying his body on the defensive line , did a great deal more than his two bullocking tries and fully deserved his man - of - the - match award			0
@entity39 ’s approach was quite different , but so too was their execution			2
having chosen to run the ball on almost every occasion , they piled up handling errors with cavalier abandon			0
they will forever curse the genuinely crucial mistake , seven minutes from time , when the endlessly impressive @entity132 strode on to a pass , drew the last white - shirted defender and flung a desperately reckless ball to @entity136			0
it should have sent the @entity86 wing stretching round beneath the posts			0
instead , it flew into touch , and both the chance and the match were lost			0
@entity9 players celebrate @entity30 's second try at @entity1 during the november international on saturday @entity147 and @entity9 blindside @entity148 feeds @entity150 after a clean take at lineout time that single cameo said everything about @entity39 ’s approach and their shortcomings			1
they spent 80 minutes intent on finding space , inventing opportunities , indulging their attacking instincts			0
with a touch more precision , they might have left @entity9 with an autumn to forget , instead , at the close of a long and arduous tour , they perished under a cluster of self - made errors			1
@entity0 will now contemplate the lessons of autumn			2
there will be spread sheets and video analysis and stats galore , since that is his way			0
and he will take great encouragement from the way in which certain young players have been tested and have emerged with credit			0
@entity180 is now looking like the out - half who will shepherd @entity9 through the next few years , while the wings , @entity184 and @entity185 , have demonstrated a willingness to inflict all manner of damage on those rare occasions when they are in possession of the ball			1
@entity9 players jump for joy as their scrum crashes over the line to allow @entity30 to score his second try @entity180 kicks a penalty against @entity39 at @entity1 during the november international on saturday the @entity1 crowd , who may have a part to play in events next year , showed every sign of getting behind their team in full - hearted fashion			1
one senses that they prize destinations far beyond mere journeys			0
and there are others who will be ready to come in			0
as @entity0 was eager to point out , @entity9 have seven @entity210 currently unavailable ; players capable of making a real difference			1
and yet … there is little to lift the spirits , to enthuse the soul , to persuade anybody but the most ardent loyalists that @entity9 ’s journey will culminate in the ultimate success			2
‘ we ’re not getting carried away , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ there ’s still a lot of work to do			0
’ indeed , there is , and we should wish them well			0
and if they could go about that work with just a touch more flair , a shade more enterprise , and the merest dash of bright invention , how very much more confident @entity9 would feel			2
@entity9 head coach @entity0 looks on during the international at @entity1 on saturday the @entity9 scrum will cause @entity236 many sleepless nights in the coming months			1

@entity9 beat @entity39 *26* - *17* at @entity1 on saturday
win was built on forward power and scrum dominance from @entity9
@entity0 defended his side , who he said played ' intelligently '
it is a shame to admit that @entity9 can not beat the best attractively
@entity103 and @entity99 will not be *phased* by forward play
