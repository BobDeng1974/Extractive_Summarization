by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 23 september 2013 it is known as the ' concrete monstrosity '			0
locals branded it an eyesore			2
the council has struggled to pay for its maintenance for decades - and was planning to knock it down			0
but according to the government , this 1960s bus garage is a national treasure			2
in a move that has shocked most of @entity13 , the building , built in 1969 , was today given listed status			1
saved : @entity16 has today been made a @entity18 listed building by culture minister @entity19 the station , believed to be the second biggest in @entity22 , can accommodate 80 double decker cars and included 1,100 car parking spaces			1
despite its ugly appearance , residents have been petitioning to save the long - standing depo after a survey showed 80 per cent of the @entity31 town feel attached to it			1
a campaign was launched by @entity34 and the @entity35 and after a consultation period , culture minister @entity19 announced today that it will be made a @entity18 listed building			1
listed buildings are protected from demolition as they are categorised as being ' nationally important and of special interest '			2
@entity41 , which announced plans to demolish the building to make way for a shopping centre in december 2012 , said it was disappointed at the ruling			1
' monster ' : council bosses wanted to demolish it last year			0
it is believed to be @entity22 's second biggest station councillor @entity52 , leader of @entity41 said : ' obviously it 's not the outcome we were hoping for			1
' we 've always said the bus station is too big , provides relatively poor facilities for bus passengers and costs @entity13 taxpayers over £ 300,000 a year to maintain			1
' we will have to take some time now to consider the listing decision and the options for moving forward			0
' in particular , we need to look at costs and the impact on budgets and how it affects @entity13 taxpayers			1
we will work closely with @entity66 as transport authority to consider the next steps			0
' the council said it took the decision to demolish the building because they estimated it would cost between £ 17m and £ 23m to refurbish it and bring it up to modern day standards			1
the building was first threatened with demolition more than 10 years ago			1
in 2000 , opposition to the demolition led to a failed application for listed building status by @entity34			1
national treasure : despite multiple attempts from the council , the building can never be demolished putting forward the case for a smaller station , a report , commissioned by the council and @entity90 in 2000 , stated that ' buses arriving and leaving the bus station have very low bus occupancy rates indicating that passengers alight and board elsewhere in the town centre			1
the bus station car park similarly suffers from the poor pedestrian linkages			0
' but a survey conducted by the @entity100 in may 2010 found that @entity16 was @entity13 people 's favourite building			1
despite further rejected application to list the bus station in 2010 - and a review of the decision was turned down in 2011 - the bus station featured on the 2012 @entity109 's list of sites at risk			0
in 2012 , @entity112 of @entity113 in @entity13 and a member of the @entity116 campaign presented a petition of 1,435 signatures to @entity41 calling for a referendum on the future of the bus station and argued that 80 per cent of @entity13 people surveyed supported keeping the bus station and investing in it			1
campaigner @entity125 said : ' if @entity41 had got its way , @entity16 would be no more			1
' it would have been demolished at vast public expense destroying a building with clear and distinctive architectural merit which i know the majority of @entity133 cherish			0

grim up north , @entity13 , 6 minutes ago oh please no ! whoever thinks this monstrosity is worth preserving needs there head examining			1
@entity13 and especially that part of the @entity143 is stuck in a 1960 's time warp and needs millions spending on it to regenerate the whole area			2
now if the @entity143 was south of @entity148 then money would be no problem			0

@entity161 , @entity162 , 1 hour ago looks quite stylish and elegant to me			0
seriously @entity163 , @entity164 , 1 hour ago knock the hideous thing down			0
@entity166 , @entity13 , 1 hour ago as a kid we used to take our bikes to the top of the car park , disconnect our brakes and see who far we could get down the spiral ramps before bailing out ! @entity166 , @entity13 , 1 hour ago that whole area from the prison to the bus station should have be levelled when the new flats went up			1
it is hovel like and dingy			0
@entity184 , @entity185 , @entity159 , 4 hours ago let @entity34 pay the cost of maintanence if they like it so much			0
@entity188 , preston , @entity159 , 4 hours ago i 'm old enough to remember what the bus situation was like before this ugly / beautiful ( eye of the beholder ? } bus station was built			0
various town centre bus stops sprawled all over the town without much weather protection long queues etc. whereas with this station , weather protection , seats , but then again i doubt very much if the people that want to destroy it ever use it			0
. great that is now ' listed ' peacemaker , @entity207 , @entity159 , 5 hours ago monstrous ? it 's just an efficient building the views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of @entity214			2
