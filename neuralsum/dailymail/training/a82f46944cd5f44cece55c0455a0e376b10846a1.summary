by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:53 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 11:29 est , 18 august 2012 former @entity3 boss @entity2 today hit back at claims he misled mps over the rate - rigging scandal that cost him his job			1
a report by @entity5 ruled that the banker failed to act with ‘ candour and frankness ’ and gave ‘ highly selective ’ evidence over revelations that his bank conspired to fix interest rates			1
the @entity16 delivered damning verdicts on @entity3 , the @entity18 , the @entity19 and the @entity20 , condemning the culture of deceit in the @entity23 and the failure of its regulators to act			1
former @entity3 chief executive @entity2 gave evidence to a @entity16 in july and a new report accuses him of misleading @entity28 over the libor rate - rigging scandal mr @entity2 resigned as @entity3 chief executive last month after the bank was fined £ 290million for manipulating the interbank lending rate known as @entity33 , which affects millions of mortgages			1
today , mr @entity2 said he was disappointed and strongly disagreed with several of the committee 's statements			0
' in particular , i strongly challenge certain assertions about my testimony , ' he said			0
' i answered every question that was put to me to me truthfully , candidly and based on information available to me.i categorically refute any suggestion to the contrary			1
' i take particular issue with the attacks on @entity3 ' culture and character			1
@entity3 , one of the only major @entity51 financial institutions that did not need a rescue from the @entity53 , is a tremendous institution with an over 300 - year tradition of supporting economic growth and the communities in which we live and work			1
the @entity19 was slammed by the select committee report , which says the @entity19 was two years behind its @entity61 counterparts in investigating the affair ' i am proud of what we accomplished over the 16 years i was employed there and our prudent management of the institution helped avoid the fates that befell other @entity51 banks in 2009			0
' the picture being presented today of what @entity3 stood for under my watch could not be further from the truth			1
' mr @entity2 said that the behaviour of a small group of traders was ' reprehensible and not in keeping with @entity3 ' high standards			1
' he added : ' looking forward , it 's clear that thoughtful analysis and regulation of issues affecting the banking industry are required and i have no doubt that @entity3 is committed to being part of the solution			1
' in an interim report on the scandal , mps said mr @entity2 presided over a culture at the bank where there was ‘ something deeply wrong ’			0
his testimony to the @entity16 , in which the @entity61 claimed to be unaware of the wrongdoing until days before the fine was announced , has been described as unconvincing			2
‘ select committees are entitled to expect candour and frankness from witnesses before them , ’ the @entity5 ’ report said			0
‘ mr @entity2 ’s evidence , at times highly selective , fell well short of the standard that @entity28 expects , particularly from such an experienced and senior witness			1
’ the @entity16 said it was ‘ shocking ’ that the @entity33 corruption , which went on between 2005 and 2009 , ‘ flourished for so long ’			2
mr @entity2 said the scandal made him ‘ physically sick ’ – but the select committee has accused him and other senior managers of turning ‘ a blind eye ’			0
it said : ‘ this attempted manipulation of @entity33 should not be dismissed as being only the behaviour of a small group of rogue traders			0
such behaviour would only be possible if the management of the bank turned a blind eye to the culture of the trading floor			0
’ mr @entity2 was also accused of putting up a ‘ smokescreen ’ by drawing attention to a conversation he had with @entity122 , the deputy governor of the @entity18 , in october 2008			2
@entity18 chief : @entity125 this appeared to give the impression that mr @entity122 had given the nod to @entity3 to rig rates to allay fears over its financial health			1
while mr @entity122 has escaped serious censure , @entity133 sources said the report dents both his and @entity19 boss @entity137 ’s hopes of succeeding sir @entity125 as the @entity18 ’s next governor			2
it is good news for former cabinet secretary @entity141			0
he is favoured by @entity142 , who will have a say in the selection process			0
a senior government source said : ‘ @entity146 will be singing in his bath			0
’ the mps say the @entity19 was two years behind @entity61 authorities in launching a formal investigation into the imbroglio			0
and the report also accuses the @entity18 of ‘ naivety ’			1
‘ the evidence suggests that the @entity18 was aware of the incentive for banks to behave dishonestly , yet did not think that dishonesty was occurring , ’ it states			1
‘ nor did it appear to have asked the @entity19 to check to see if such dishonesty was occurring			0
’ the committee has called for an urgent reform at the bank , accusing regulators of arbitrarily pushing mr @entity2 out of his job			0
@entity16 chairman @entity166 said : ' regulators should not decide the composition of boards in response to headlines ... such an informal approach as was taken in this case is open to abuse			2
' a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ while we do n’t expect to agree with every finding in [ the report ] , we recognise that change is required			2
that is why we have established an independent review of our business practices			0
’ the @entity19 said it has ‘ put in place a number of reforms in recent years , including a tougher fines policy for enforcement cases and a completely new model of bank supervision ’ .			2

' i answered every question put to me truthfully and candidly '
he gave ' highly selective ' evidence , says @entity16
@entity18 *criticised* for ' naivety ' in dealings with @entity3
