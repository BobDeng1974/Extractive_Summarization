it took @entity1 just five short , glittering years to win their fifth @entity2			1
the next five are taking rather longer			0
as they face their noisy neighbours , @entity5 , in @entity6 this weekend it will be more than half a century since they wrapped up their monopoly of the first five editions of club football ’s most glorious championship			1
yet the impact of the grey evening of may 18 , 1960 in @entity13 remains @entity14 vivid in the minds of those of us who looked on in wonder			0
full house : @entity1 's @entity20 goes past @entity22 defender @entity21 at @entity23 in 1960 it stays with us as the tantalising pinnacle to which all others – from @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , to @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , to @entity34 , @entity35 , and @entity36 and now @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 must aspire			1
a year after the day the music died in @entity42 ’s plane crash , our impressionable generation of teenagers saw the magic come to life			0
so amazingly did @entity1 revolutionise our understanding of the greatest game that it was if aliens had landed in @entity51			1
for @entity52 , read men in white			0
after @entity1 7 - 3 @entity22 football would never be the same again			1
not now our eyes had been opened to @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 in their brillilance			0
the largest crowd ever to attend one of these finals – almost 135,000 – were joined in awe by a television audience of some 70 million , myself included			0
the @entity66 was already enchanted by @entity1 but this was the match which turned the shimmering , distant myth into reality for this , the birthplace of football			2
it also elevated to its plinth the tournament which was to expand into the @entity2			2
there had been stirrings of our imagination six years earlier when @entity57 led @entity82 on a six - goal invasion of @entity85 ’s @entity84			1
the @entity86 returned , to @entity87 , to astound us again by scoring four of @entity1 ’s seven goals			2
yet even that feat was surpassed on the night			0
@entity90 's greatest : @entity56 was outstanding in the 1960 @entity2 final 1956 - beat @entity92 4 - 3 at @entity93 , @entity94 1957 - beat @entity95 2 - 0 at @entity96 , @entity1 1958 - beat @entity97 3 - 2 at @entity98 , @entity99 1959 - @entity100 2 - 0 at @entity101 , @entity102 1960 - @entity103 7 - 3 at @entity23 , @entity13 1966 - beat @entity104 2 - 1 at @entity98 , @entity99 1998 - beat @entity105 1 - 0 at @entity106 , @entity107 2000 - @entity108 3 - 0 at @entity109 , @entity94 2002 - beat @entity110 2 - 1 at @entity23 , @entity13 a certain @entity111 not only scored a hat - trick , also , but orchestrated the play with the imperious command of @entity115 conducting at the rostrum			1
here was @entity118 ’s predecessor , the first world ’s greatest footballer			1
nor were the @entity120 he bewitched and bamboozled mere cannon fodder			0
@entity22 had put 12 past the substantial @entity124 team of the time over the two legs of their semi-final			1
they also took the lead against @entity1 , in the 18th minute			2
not that it lasted long			0
@entity111 equalised nine minutes later and by the time @entity22 scored their second , in the 72nd minute , they were 7 - 1 down			1
fantasy football had been born of human genius			0
the wonder of the @entity2 swept across the @entity137 and seven years later , in the same @entity138 to which @entity140 ’s @entity139 hope @entity38 returns now with @entity1 , @entity135 shocked @entity141 to become @entity51 ’s first winners			1
seventh heaven : @entity111 nets another in the famous rout even their own fans were so stunned and so aware of being part of history that some just stayed on to live in @entity149 , working as builders , or even opening bars in and around @entity6			2
they all celebrated as if there was no tomorrow , one so copiously that after being herded onto the plane home with others wearing the green and white he woke up upon landing in @entity13 to exclaim : ‘ but my car ’s outside the stadium			0
’ another year on and @entity160 completed their rise from the ashes of the @entity164 air disaster to beat @entity165 at @entity84			0
@entity166 scored twice , then wept for the other @entity167 who had perished			0
@entity31 romped away for one of the others to confirm that the fifth beatle was a big hit			0
those finals were @entity51 epics , as was the @entity175 on the @entity176 when @entity177 staged the mother of all comebacks to shell - shock @entity97			0
comeback kings : @entity182 ( left ) and @entity35 celebrate @entity177 's 2005 @entity2 triumph those clubs , those finals , those stars are legends			1
but it is @entity1 who wear the crown			2
and it is @entity111 who remains the most dazzling of its jewels , still one of the five greatest footballers of all time			1
over to you , @entity38 and @entity39 … i defer to no - one in my admiration of @entity200 and the stylish football which he refuses to compromise			1
but @entity203 ’s celebrations at winning the @entity204 were so excessive that they spoke of desperation , not redemption			1
this , lest we forget , is a competition in which @entity200 used to field a few reserves when the @entity210 were winning the one that really mattered to them , the @entity213 , and challenging for the one he still wants most of all , the @entity2			1
@entity214 : @entity203 celebrated wildly after they won their first trophy for nine years after nine barren years it was high time @entity203 won something			1
but while the players and the fans were dancing in the streets last weekend , more sober judgement needs to be passed on where they stand today			0
at no time since @entity224 did @entity203 look capable of winning the @entity226 title			2
the crown of @entity228 was always beyond them and for a worrying time it seemed they might not re-qualify for that next season			2
and they made incredibly hard work of beating @entity236 at @entity84			0
if that laborious victory has clinched a renewed contract for @entity200 , it is no less than he deserves for his half - a - working lifetime ’s body of work with @entity203			1
master of the art : @entity200 has stayed true to his principles throughout his career yet his current team continues to look lightweight compared with his @entity248 of yore			1
so it is difficult to escape the feeling that the directors may be extending his term – and giving him the money to spend on new players – partly because top - class successors are so difficult to identify			0
think @entity160 , @entity257 – and @entity258 yet to manage in @entity85			2
think @entity259 having to swallow hard and bring @entity260 back to @entity261 when most else failed			0
but think , also , of the queue to grab @entity200 if he were to leave north @entity263			2
perhaps what both he and @entity203 are really in need of is - a change			2
@entity85 manager @entity267 opines that , given time , he could organise a pub team to put the blocks on @entity160 , @entity270 and @entity271 included			1
why not ? sir @entity272 won @entity85 ’s only @entity139 with some lads from the local			1
although , admittedly , he had some world class players in that @entity277 class of ’ 66 several were partial to a drink			0
and it was not unknown for them to slip out for a quickie on the night before a big match			0
1966 and all that : sir @entity272 celebrates winning the @entity139 with @entity277 and @entity284 mind you i would have wished either of these fine managers luck trying to do anything with my old pub team in which , as a midfield clogger , i often had to play as a 5ft 7½in makeshift centre half			1
that said , perhaps @entity267 could do worse than take @entity35 and the lads out for few caiprinhas in @entity295 before they play @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 .			0

@entity1 won the first five @entity228 cups , from 1956 - 60
their 7 - 3 win over @entity22 in 1960 was magical
real face neighbours @entity5 in @entity2 final on *saturday*
@entity111 was the first ' greatest footballer in the world '
@entity203 's @entity204 celebrations *smacked* of desperation
@entity210 might be keeping @entity200 because they ca *n't* find successor
@entity272 's 1966 @entity85 side was the best ' pub team ' ever
