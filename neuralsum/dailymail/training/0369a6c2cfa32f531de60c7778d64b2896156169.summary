ill patients who dial 999 for an ambulance are increasingly being sent police cars or taxis instead			1
one ambulance service has seen a staggering 350 per cent increase in the use of taxis to pick up patients in three years			1

ambulance trusts are using taxis , police cars and firefighters to take patients to hospital , the @entity14 heard figures obtained under freedom of information laws by @entity22 reveal that in 2012 - 13 158 taxis attended 999 calls in the @entity25			1
in 2009 - 10 the number was just 35			1
shadow health secretary @entity27 also warned police cars were being used on a daily basis to ferry patients to hospital			1
in another area an ambulance service is using retained firefighters to attend calls			2
the warning about the crisis in the @entity12 comes as new figures showed freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 extra deaths , in @entity41 and @entity42			1
it marked a 29 per cent increase on the previous year			2
health secretary @entity45 today announced details of how an extra £ 250 million for struggling @entity48 units will be spent this winter			2
it includes almost 2,500 extra beds the equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff			0
@entity22 's @entity27 ( left ) revealed the growing reliance on taxis to take patients to hospital , as health secretary @entity45 announced how funding would be spent on more nurses and beds this winter freezing temperatures last winter led to 31,000 deaths , new figures show			1
the number of ' excess winter deaths ' in @entity41 and @entity42 rose by dramatically by 29 per cent compared with the previous year			1
campaigners condemned the figures as a ' national scandal '			0
the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) said the majority of the excess deaths were among pensioners - with over- 75s accounting for 25,600 winter - related deaths in 2012 - 13			1
temperatures plunged across @entity72 at the start of this year , with march the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just @entity76 ( @entity77 )			1
the @entity66 said : ' the number of deaths peaked in the first week of january , which coincided with a peak in rates of influenza - like illness over the @entity85 weeks			1
' the mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between february and april 2013			2
' more women died as a result of the cold ( 18,000 ) compared to 13,100 men			0
but in the @entity14 he was challenged over the increasing reliance of over-stretched ambulance services on other vehicles to take patients to hospital			2
mr @entity27 claimed that as a&es fill up , ambulances become ‘ trapped ’ and unable to handover patients			2
he urged mr @entity45 to take action now to avoid the ambulance hold - ups ‘ engulfing ’ other emergency services			2
mr @entity27 told the @entity14 : ‘ today i want to put to you new evidence that the @entity48 crisis is deepening and having a serious knock - on effect on ambulance services			0
‘ information from police forces reveals that police cars having to ferry patients to @entity48 is far more widespread than people realise and in some areas happening on a daily basis			1
‘ one ambulance service is now using retained firefighters to attend calls but this is how bad things have got - another ambulance service has seen a 350 per cent increase in the number of 999 calls attended by taxis			1
‘ do you think it 's ever acceptable that when a patient dials 999 a taxi turns up instead ? ’ but mr @entity45 accused his shadow of talking up a crisis that is not happening and said the coalition was hitting its targets , unlike the last @entity22 administration when mr @entity27 was health secretary			0
mr @entity45 replied : ‘ i 'm afraid this is utterly irresponsible			0
we are hitting our @entity48 target , we are hitting our ambulance standard			0
when you were health secretary you missed the ambulance standard for october , november , december and january			0
‘ what you are doing is trying to talk up a crisis that is n't happening and you should think about people on the front line and just for once put patients before politics			0
’ mr @entity27 suggested that the country would have heard mr @entity45 's ‘ complacency ’ and warned large parts of the country did not have adequate ambulance cover			0
he told the health secretary : ‘ you did n't condemn the use of taxis			0
i 'll tell you now , it 's unacceptable but it 's happening on your watch and why ? ‘ because ambulances are trapped at @entity10 , unable to hand over patients			0
this means 999 response times are getting worse and large swathes of the country right now are without adequate ambulance cover			0
‘ is n't it time you were honest with the public , admitted the scale of the crisis facing the @entity12 this winter and took action now to prevent it engulfing other emergency services ? ’			0
