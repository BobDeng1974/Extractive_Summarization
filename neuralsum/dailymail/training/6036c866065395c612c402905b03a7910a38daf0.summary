by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:23 est , 26 february 2014 they call him @entity5 - because his bizarre work incorporates his dead subjects ' ashes into his artwork			1
and he 's certainly proved popular			0
artist @entity10 has cut out a rather odd niche in the art world by turn his customers ' ashes , or the ashes of a loved one , into paintings			1
among the bizarre requests he 's had are paintings of a customer 's favourite fishing spots , animals , flowers and even @entity24			2
artist @entity25 receives daily requests from people wishing for either their ashes , or the ashes of others , to be turned into paintings			1
at work : mr @entity10 , from @entity32 in @entity33 , came across the unique concept while watching a tv show mr @entity10 , from @entity32 , in @entity33 , was approached by a friend of a friend , who asked if he could create a memorial portrait of a loved one - and he suggested painting it with their ashes			1
though initially nervous , mr @entity10 , 32 , said that he found handling the human remains quite natural			1
the artist only requests a small amount of the cremated remains , which he then mixes into certain areas of a portrait			2
he works off a photograph provided by either the deceased 's friend , relative or loved one , and asks for their input throughout the process			2
mr @entity10 said that each work takes him between four and eight hours to complete , and that as well as mixing the ashes into the paint , he also adds some to the surface of the portrait , using special glues and resin			1
the artist marks the back of every portrait to state that the work was created using some human remains - just in case if falls into the hands of someone who is unaware of his methods			2
one of mr @entity10 's masterpieces , painted using the ash supplied by a customer the artist has said some people find his work ' sick ' or ' creepy ' , but he says his customers are pleased another happy customer : this woman looks overjoyed at the painting she commissioned from mr @entity10 mr @entity10 , whose collection is called ' ashes to @entity82 , ' now receives requests from people everyday			1
the artist , who believes the majority of people do not find his work creepy or weird , said : ' a friend of a friend in another state asked me to do a memorial portrait of her recently deceased husband			1
' after agreeing to it , as i had done before , she asked if i could use the cremation remains in the work - something she believed he would have liked			2
tentatively , i said that would be fine			0
mr @entity10 , 32 , was approached by a friend of a friend , who asked if he could create a memorial portrait of a loved one not all the work mr @entity10 does is of dead people , here is a painting he created of a woman ' i thought i 'd have an odd reaction to handling human remains the first time , but it was n't strange at all			1
it was just another medium to work in			0
i wore gloves , handled them respectfully , adhered them to the surface of the painting , and sent the unused portion back			0
' ' the majority of people seem to really love the idea and have expressed interest in getting one for a loved one or even having one made for themselves when they pass away			0
' i 've even had elderly people contact me to arrange this service for themselves when they pass			0
but i also had one girl on @entity124 who compared me to @entity125 - although others commenting on the thread were quick to correct her			0
' for those that find it " sick " or " creepy " , i just tell them they do n't have to purchase one			0
for everyone else , they are truly touched by the unique service			0
' i always say , " having ashes in an urn on the fireplace is a good way to constantly remember that someone died			1
using their remains to create a beautiful piece of art is a great way to remember that they lived			0
