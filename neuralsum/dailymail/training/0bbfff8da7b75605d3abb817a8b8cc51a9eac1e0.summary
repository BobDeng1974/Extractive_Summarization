@entity0 , condemned as a lightweight liability on the left this season , was restored to his central position against @entity5 and responded with his best performance for some considerable time			1
his creativity was most potent in a concentrated burst of little over three minutes – the period when @entity11 scored the goals to win this game – but throughout the match he showed his class in linking play in various areas of the pitch			1
@entity11 completed 741 passes against @entity5 , the most by any @entity22 side over the last two seasons , and @entity0 was the offensive conductor – completing 54 forward half passes , the most of any @entity11 player , at a success rate of 91.5 per cent			1
@entity0 celebrates his goal to give @entity11 the lead in their 3 - 0 win at @entity5 on saturday @entity0 put in an outstanding performance against @entity5 to silence his recent critics @entity0 was congratulated by team - mates @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity35 after scoring courtesy of @entity37 the touches were neat and the passes mainly simple but usually forward , continuing the flow of moves with minimal fuss			1
he looked sharp and , as @entity44 made clear , this was a moment to have faith in his biggest signing			0
drop him , was the call of most who have observed @entity0 this season			1
hand him a starring role , was his manager ’s response			2
‘ i felt he was at the point where you have to show him that confidence is there and he showed as well he can respond when he is under scrutiny , ’ explained @entity44			0
it was a courageous managerial decision which paid off			0
as @entity0 ’s heat map shows he was not prohibited to solely central areas , rather he moved across the line just behind striker @entity35 depending on the ebb and flow of the game			1
he would also drop deeper to receive the ball and start attacks , following the trail of the ball as it moved up the pitch			0
particularly pleasing for @entity44 was the way @entity0 linked up with @entity35			1
the former @entity74 striker fed the @entity75 for his goal and the pair also exchanged passes to make it 2 - 0			1
early days for the partnership , but promising signs			0
‘ that instinctiveness will come , ’ said @entity35			2
the @entity75 maestro was revitalised playing in a central position , as opposed to the left @entity0 showed the energy and creativity that has been missing from his game so often this season @entity35 showed his appreciation to his new team - mate after @entity0 put it on a plate for the @entity11 forward @entity92 is not a scapegoat - @entity44 minutes played : 90 goals : 1 attempts on target : 1 attempts off target : 1 @entity97 passes : 75 @entity98 passes : 69 pass completion : 92 per cent accurate forward half passes : 54 forward half pass completion : 91.5 % assists : 1 @entity103 passes : 2 courtesy of @entity37 @entity44 admitted the no 10 role is the position @entity0 craves			1
but it meant @entity108 and @entity109 moved to the bench and @entity32 operated alongside @entity111 in the holding role			2
‘ i find you ten more players in my squad who want to play in the middle , ’ @entity44 added with a smile			0
that is the conundrum now for the @entity120 , who must work out a formula that sees all his stars shine			0
if he continues to thrust @entity0 onto the platform which holds no hiding place it leaves @entity32 needing to operate deeper or out wide – where the @entity127 only fitfully performed in the season before his breakthrough last campaign			2
@entity109 wants the job of supplying the striker too , he did well higher up against @entity134 , but it may be he is best dictating from further back and bombing forward			2
@entity0 finished the day at @entity137 with @entity138 watching boxer @entity141 defeat @entity139 in an @entity142 and @entity144 and @entity145 title fight @entity0 showed his true class after a disappointing midweek display against @entity148 @entity108 will not stay on the bench on many more occasions so @entity44 needs to find a way to incorporate the @entity152 to greatest effect			1
this is all before we consider @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 , once he returns from injury , a player who made his desires to play centrally evident during his contract stand - off			0
it is a problem most manager ’s in the @entity22 would give their right leg and probably a few fingers to have , but could still leave @entity44 chewing the fingernails			0
like our dedicated @entity168 .			0

the @entity75 *playmaker* *bounced* back from a poor performance against @entity148 to *inspire* @entity11 to *victory*
@entity0 opened the scoring in 32nd minute to set @entity11 on their way
the former @entity178 star also *claimed* an assist
@entity0 completed 54 passes in the @entity5 half , a success rate of 91.5 per cent
he *thrived* in the central role having been *ineffective* out on the left
@entity35 and an @entity189 own goal gave @entity11 3 - 0 win
