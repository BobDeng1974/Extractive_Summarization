by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 24 september 2012 updated : 08:40 est , 24 september 2012 @entity2 's extreme northern territories have been devoid of forests for millions of years			2
but the forests could be about to return , thanks to changing global temperatures , according to research at the @entity7 , which suggests the freezing temperatures may mellow just enough to see the return of the ancient forests which once surrounded this icy area			1
the fossilised forest found on @entity13 in @entity14 is between 2.6 and 3 million years old according to estimations , based on the presence of extinct species and on paleomagnetic analyses			1
paleomagentic analysis involves looking at how the @entity22 's magnetic field has affected the magnetic sediment in rocks - like a compass , they turn to follow the magnetic poles			2
a glacier on @entity13 , @entity2 : the island is almost desolate of wildlife - but this could chance as the area warms where in the world ? @entity13 in north @entity2 may see the return of forests , which last graced the shores more than two million years ago scientists can use this information to date rocks as the history of the movement of the magnetic poles is relatively well known			1
@entity42 , of the @entity7 's @entity43 , presenting his findings at the @entity45 in @entity46 , said : ' according to the data model , climate conditions on @entity13 will be able to support the kinds of trees we find in the fossilised forest that currently exist there , such as willow , pine and spruce			1
' i 've also found evidence of a possible growth of oak and hickory near the study site during this period			0
material transportation during the closure of the base camp in 2009 ' although it would of course take time for a whole forest to regrow , the findings show that our grandchildren should be able to plant a tree and watch it grow			1
' @entity76 samples in the ancient forest have been preserved throughout the eons in peat and by permafrost			0
@entity42 said : ' we studied the sediments in the forest and discovered pollen that are usually found in climates where the annual average temperature is around 0 degrees @entity87 or 32 @entity88			0
' by comparison , current average conditions on @entity13 are around -15 ° @entity91 )			1
the samples were taken from few drill holes 10 cm in diameter of one to two metres deep			0
the harshness of the @entity96 winter and the remoteness of the forest mean that scientists have very little opportunity to delve into its secrets			0
even during the summer , the @entity102 and his colleagues had to endure extreme conditions such as 80 km / h winds			0
“ there is so much mystery that surrounds this forest – for example , how these trees managed to survive the relentless dark of the @entity96 winter , ” he said , adding that the next steps for this line of research could include looking more closely at other plant remains in order to get a better understanding of what the local flora was .			2

rising temperatures in @entity13 suggest ' our grandchildren could plant a seed and watch it grow '
