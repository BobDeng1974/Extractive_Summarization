for most couples , a peck on the lips is a quick way to show affection			0
but for @entity6 , a kiss from husband @entity5 can trigger agonising hives			1
the mother - of - three , from @entity10 , suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water			1
she was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm			0
now the 28 - year - old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years , because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare - up			1
@entity6 , from @entity10 , suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water			1
she claims a kiss from her husband @entity5 ( right ) can trigger a painful flare - up , due to contact with his saliva she said : ' because @entity5 's lips are wet , the saliva can make me react			1
he 's got to make sure his lips are dry before he gave me a kiss			0
' it 's not every time - i can do the same thing time and time again and not react , but then i 'll do it once more and get a flare - up			1
' her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem , rather than drinking liquid			1
the situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode , as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry			1
however , she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances			2
' for example , if @entity5 was to give me a kiss on a hot day when i 'm flushed , i 'd probably flare up , but maybe not if i was in a cool environment , ' she said			2
' it can be frustrating but he 's really supportive			0
' after years together , it 's become normal			0
you learn how to get used it			0
but it can be bothersome			0
' mrs @entity6 now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare - ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she can not not touch water			1
even hugging her children @entity66 , nine , @entity67 , two and four - year - old step - daughter @entity68 , can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction			1
' it affects every aspect of my day to day life , ' she said			0
' i have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids			0
my hands ca n't take them both – it 's too painful			2
' she added : ' when i 've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction			2
her condition has become so bad that her hugging her children can trigger an episode , as their body heat makes her sweat - and bathing them can be problematic ' even tears can trigger the hives			1
i 've had to train myself not to cry			0
' i 've learned not to get too angry or frustrated , as this can make my body flush and cause me to sweat , which can be very painful			2
' due to her condition , mrs @entity6 must ensure she bathes in under 10 minutes to try and minimise the allergic reaction			1
' i 've found the closer the water is to body temperature the faster i react , so i have really hot baths to try lessen the reaction , ' she siad			1
' i also do n't drink cold water - it feels quite sharp at the back of my throat - so i stick to coffee			1
' mrs @entity6 , who has to keep antihistamines and an epipen with her at all times , also suffers from exercise - induced anaphylaxis			1
previously a size eight , with a keen interest in fitness , the exercise allergy combined with side effects of her medication have seen her expand to a size 14			1
she discovered this second allergy just months after her urticaria diagnosis after playing on a @entity119 game at home			2
' it was completely out of the blue , ' she said			0
' i could n't breathe , i was on the floor struggling to get air into my lungs			0
' thankfully , i stopped the exercising straight away and my breathing slowed , but i was left feeling quite sick for a few days afterwards			0
' the mother - of - two suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria – an allergy to water			1
she was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm			0
@entity135 known as weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water she can now tell when an episode may strike - and knows she must stop whatever she 's doing when she feels the earning signs			1
' i ca n't articulate what 's happening at the time - it all becomes quite foggy in my head , ' she said			2
on another occasion , mrs @entity6 was forced to sit on the floor , gasping for breath in the middle of @entity10 ' @entity149 shopping centre after a reaction was triggered by simply walking up a flight of stairs			1
in a vicious cycle , the anaphylactic reaction causes her to sweat which , in turn , triggers her water allergy			1
she said : ' the two worst episodes i 've had have been after no more than five minutes – the equivalent to a warm up			0
@entity160 , also known as hives or nettle rash , is a condition in which short - lived swellings occur anywhere on the body			1
these swellings ( weals ) may be pale , pink , or red , of different sizes and shape and itchy			0
as the raised weals flatten , they leave red marks that disappear usually in a day			0
new weals may then appear in other areas the itchy reaction is caused by the release of histamine in response to a number of different triggers			2
some form of it affects 20 per cent of people at some point			0
however , aquagenic urticaria - triggered by water of any temperature - is extremely rare			1
the weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water			1
in more severe cases drinking water can cause minor swelling in the throat			1
there is no known cure			0
symptoms can be lessened by reducing exposure - such as taking quick showers , applying petroleum jelly to the skin as well as taking anti-histamines			1
' i 've had to rule out exercise completely now , it 's just too much of a worry			2
' mrs @entity6 , who has spoken out as part of @entity210 , has also had to teach eldest daughter @entity66 how to administer an @entity213 injection			1
now , she faces a daily checklist to ensure she 's done everything she can to avoid reactions			0
' before leaving the house i have to ask myself if i can get to the bus stop or if it 's too far and likely to trigger my reactions , ' she said			2
' i have to check if it 's going to rain and make sure i have back - up clothing in case i get too hot or too cold			2
' my social life has gone to pot. ' before , i could just say , " of course i 'll come out ' but now , it 's , " where are we going ? what 's the weather ? can i park somewhere close so i do n't have to walk and risk my anaphylaxis triggering ? " ' ' there are all these stupid little things i have to consider			2
' @entity235 , nurse advisor at @entity236 said : ' urticaria is also known as nettle rash or hives			0
' it is a red raised itchy rash and is very common , affecting one person in five at some point in their life			0
' in most people , it settles quickly and is no more than a mild inconvenience , but in some people it can be severe and long lasting			0
' a very rare form of urticaria is that which is triggered by water , which is called aquagenic urticaria , the red raised itchy rash comes up on contact with water			2
' treatment can help the symptoms and the person should receive specialist information from an allergist / immunologist			0
