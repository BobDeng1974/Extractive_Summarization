@entity0 will go into inquest mode on monday morning and must confront the uncomfortable truth they are showing no sign of gaining ground on rugby ’s leading nations , with 10 months to go until the @entity7			1
on saturday they suffered a fifth successive @entity9 defeat — the worst losing run since 2006			1
this was their 12th consecutive match without a win against the @entity15 , also stretching back eight years			1
while there was talk of a narrow margin , the scoreline once again disguised glaring shortcomings — 14 @entity22 points came against 14 men and the @entity15 were short of their own imposing peak			1
@entity26 's @entity0 team is in crisis after their loss to @entity15 exposed a raft of shortcomings @entity0 celebrate @entity31 's try , their second while @entity15 's @entity33 was in the sin bin when the numbers were even , those in white were largely unable to find ways through the green wall ahead of them			1
instead of building momentum for next year ’s tournament , @entity0 are struggling to maintain standards set in @entity26 ’s tenure as head coach			1
defeats by @entity45 and @entity15 have left them in crisis going into their remaining @entity48 series clashes with @entity49 and @entity50			1
those fixtures must lead to an urgent upturn in performance and results , otherwise all talk of progress will be exposed as hollow			0
as it is , the situation is critical and here are the pressing issues that need to be addressed … cut out the errors @entity0 are making too many fundamental errors in handling and kicking , along with all the other lapses in timing and discipline which led to missed scoring chances or penalties being conceded			1
@entity67 made a searing break in the first half on saturday but delayed his pass and a certain try was squandered			0
@entity67 made an excellent break but his poor decision - making squandered a certain try these are the margins			1
even when conditions improved , there were too many fumbles and spills and misjudgments			0
@entity45 ’s dominance is founded on superb consistency in their catch - and - pass skills			2
it is not a mystery formula ; it comes down to accuracy when the heat is on			0
playing smart this was a much - repeated theme during the post-match discussions			2
there was once again a lack of @entity22 composure and authority in terms of decision - making			1
wrong options were taken by scrambled minds , stalked by doubts , as typified by @entity104 ’s intercepted pass which led to @entity105 storming clear to score from halfway , and @entity107 ’s ill - advised attempt to launch a counter-attack from his own 22 early on			1
players are selected in part due to their natural instincts but somehow these are being eroded in the test environment			0
better ability to read the flow of the game and adapt on the hoof is needed			0
@entity0 's players are helpless as @entity105 races away after intercepting @entity104 's pass trouble at @entity120 the faith shown in @entity107 by the management has become dangerously excessive			1
it is turning into a blind spot			0
it appears that @entity126 will start at fly - half against @entity49 and his promotion is overdue			2
@entity0 have to consider other options and accept that their first - choice playmaker ’s game is in tatters at the moment			1
the delay in removing him on saturday was damaging			0
the @entity136 was clearly in discomfort and his kicking from hand had become a grave problem			0
he appeared hesitant in attacking the opposition ’s defensive line and releasing runners around him			0
it was noticeable how @entity146 — aided and abetted by @entity148 ’ dynamic work — managed to create space after coming on			0
@entity107 has enjoyed the faith of the coaching staff but that has become dangerously excessive kicking woes this is not just about @entity107 , it is a more general concern in terms of the balance of the team and the lack of impact in this key area			1
@entity0 have spoken about their quest to deliver more contestable kicks , but the results remain mixed			1
@entity15 caused trouble with a clever range of astute high kicks and chips into space , such as the one with which @entity170 paved the way for @entity174 ’s try			1
@entity107 and @entity104 have struggled with their in - field kicking and @entity0 ’s touch - finding efforts are a major concern			1
with a midfield combination of @entity178 and @entity179 , @entity26 is short of front - line kicking options			1
wasted wings look what happened when @entity183 was given the ball in space against @entity45 — he left them in his vapour trail to conjure a superb solo try			0
sadly , those moments are rare			0
@entity0 are simply not utilising the firepower at their disposal			2
may and @entity192 were rarely released to stretch the @entity15 with their blistering pace			2
conditions have played their part in the last two games — necessarily narrowing the approach — but nevertheless , the inability to free strike runners is a concern			0
there had been an expansion of the attacking gameplan this year , based on a clever range of distribution , but it is still all too rare that @entity0 go wide and manage to circumvent the best defences			2
@entity183 ( left ) @entity192 ( right ) were rarely given the chance to stretch the @entity15 defence breakdown bother the rolling maul was a productive weapon on both sides at @entity214 but @entity0 continue to suffer against teams who are more effective at rucks			1
the @entity15 won too many turnovers for @entity22 comfort as home carriers were too often isolated and support was too slow to arrive			2
@entity223 ’s men have been unable to fight fire with fire in this regard — relying on collective force due to a dearth of established poachers			0
they are missing the positive breakdown impact made by @entity231 and @entity232 , among others			0
@entity234 trudges from the @entity214 pitch after being sin - binned for stamping in a ruck taking ‘ positives ’ this phrase should be banished from the @entity0 set - up			1
amid all the talk of @entity9 defeats hurting like hell , especially those at home , there is far too much willingness to apply spin			2
coaches must set the tone by refusing to take minor consolations from bad results with a view to forward - planning			0
a young team is chosen because it is regarded as @entity0 ’s finest available line - up , in which case it must be judged accordingly			1
of course there will be a background focus on preparing for the @entity7 next year but in their current predicament , @entity0 ’s first priority must be beating @entity49 and @entity50			2
the sole ‘ positive ’ on @entity0 ’s radar has to be dispatching all - comers to revive their momentum			1
home rule matters the grand @entity22 plan involves @entity214 becoming a fortress ahead of the 2015 showpiece event in this country , but it ’s not happening — far from it			0
@entity45 and @entity15 expect to win in @entity269 as a matter of routine and even troubled @entity50 will arrive with hope later this month			2
@entity214 should be a fortress but major southern hemisphere nations do n't fear the home of rugby in the absence of victories , all the innovations designed to ignite the crowd at hq and raise the volume are not really working			0
players walking in from the car park inside a tight cordon of stewards and numerous flashing screens imploring @entity0 fans to ‘ carry them home ’ are not the factors which will terrify opponents			2
@entity214 is no @entity291 or @entity292			0
it is no bear - pit			0
the only way it will become a forbidding place is by the hosts winning there and gradually building up a sense of dread in away teams .			0

@entity0 's *28* - 31 loss to @entity15 was their fifth successive @entity9 defeat
they have now gone 12 matches without victory against the @entity15
@entity26 's side is making too many errors and wasting the wingers
their faith in @entity107 at @entity120 is becoming dangerously excessive
