in the filing , prosecutors said that @entity73 agents needed to question @entity2 at the time because they had to determine exactly how the brothers had constructed their explosives and whether they had any accomplices who may have posed a threat			1
' the @entity3 bombs were constructed using improvised fuses made from @entity8 lights and improvised , remote - control detonators fashioned from model car parts , ' prosecutors wrote			1
