demolition workers toppled the final tower left standing in the @entity7 @entity15 hotel - casino implosion by using a ' lasso trick ' with a crane that was reminiscent of the @entity3 after the first explosion , the concrete block structure ( pictured here after finally getting pulled down ) had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet the building was lassoed with steel cables attached to a crane that then pulled and pulled until the elevator shaft came tumbling down crews had to use cables and a crane because no wrecking balls were immediately available and the the remainder of the building , which was leaning , was considered a safety hazard after the dust cleared , the concrete block structure had dropped four stories and was left standing at a height of 100 feet			1
there were no wrecking balls immediately available and the the remainder of the building , which was leaning , was considered a safety hazard			0
so crews went to their plan b - cables and a crane , as seen on a video posted to @entity49			1
the 12 - story @entity15 casino - hotel , which opened its doors in 1970 and was briefly owned by actress @entity52 , became the 13th hotel to gain implosion infamy in @entity55			1
ready to rumble : with the sound of slot machines blurring out the noise , more than 4,000 pounds of explosives were used to demolish a @entity7 hotel early tuesday steeped in history : the 200 - room casino - hotel first opened as the @entity15 and was called the @entity52 - for its one - time owner behind - the - scenes : the implosion required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives , said @entity68 , safety coordinator for @entity7 - based @entity69 dust everywhere : preparation for the demolition extended to covering nearby pools , including at the neighboring @entity74 hotel @entity16 , a developer who purchased the property in october for $ 22.5 million in cash , plans to build a 60 - story hotel tower that could be the tallest occupied building on the @entity7			1
there would be no condos or casino			0
' instead of trying to compete with everybody , you have to have something unique , ' he said			0
and that uniqueness could involve catering to convention - goers , including incorporating untraditional office - space to appeal to companies that frequent @entity7 for conventions			2
he said he hopes to have a plan in place by the end of the year and does n't expect any kind of opening before 2018			0
@entity16 said he 'll be posting updates to @entity97 including video of tuesday 's implosion			2
he watched the demolition - which lasted around ten seconds - with his family			2
after listening to a pre-implosion soundtrack of @entity105 the group , flanked by two showgirls , did a countdown to the @entity15 's final seconds at nearly 3am , the 200 - room casino - hotel first opened as the @entity15 and was called the @entity52 - for its one - time owner - as well as the @entity111 isles and the @entity112			1
bright future : @entity16 , a developer who purchased the property in october for $ 22.5 million in cash , plans to build a 60 - story hotel tower that could be the tallest occupied building on @entity7 @entity118 had never stayed at the @entity15 or any of its incarnations , but she reveled in its demise early tuesday morning after traveling from @entity121 , @entity122 , to check an unlikely item off her life 's bucket list : witness a building implosion in person			1
' we do n't do this in @entity122 , ' she said after the dust had almost settled			0
' it was truly amazing			0
' @entity118 , 35 , her boyfriend @entity132 , 38 , and @entity7 local @entity133 , who first alerted her friend to the impending implosion , had been scoping out the casino - hotel earlier monday when they got to talking with the construction crew			1
after telling their tale , the trio earned an exclusive invite to watch the building crumble from across the street alongside the developer , his family , friends and members of the press			2
' it was one of the best experiences of my life , ' @entity118 said			0
pointing to the leftover rubble , @entity132 joked that it resembled something else			0
' that also looks like our wallet this week , ' he said			0
what took seconds to destroy required several months of planning and 4,400 pounds of explosives , said @entity68 , safety coordinator for @entity7 - based @entity69 who said the preparation extended to covering nearby pools , including at the neighboring @entity74			2
it 's been a while since a casino - hotel was felled by controlled explosives			1
between 2004 and 2007 , six vegas properties were brought down , but in the eight years since , the only strip - side implosions were the segment of the @entity173 and a parking structure			2
flashback : the casino - hotel ( seen here in 2007 ) was also known as the @entity111 isles and the @entity112 during its time the @entity15 was no marquee property on the scale of a @entity182 , which was imploded eight years ago , or a @entity183 , which made way for the @entity185			1
' it 's a little harder to gin up the same degree of interest , ' said @entity188 , @entity7 history professor @entity189 of the @entity15 's less noteworthy impending implosion			2
@entity16 said he knows this is n't a landmark property			0
perhaps appropriately , @entity16 watched the implosion of the casino - hotel he bought last year from a parking lot that paved over the spot where the @entity198 casino - hotel once stood , before it was demolished in 1995			1
instead the @entity15 , off the @entity7 across from the area 's convention center , has had several names and had fallen into bankruptcy nearly as many times , he said			0
' it is not a storied site , ' he said			0
he said it was the building itself , and rooms that resembled cubicles , that did n't work , not the location			0
its proximity both to the @entity7 and to the convention center appealed to @entity16			1
he will now work on financing the rebuild as he waits for nearby development to come to fruition .			0
