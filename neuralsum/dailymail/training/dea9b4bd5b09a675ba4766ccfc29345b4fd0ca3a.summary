by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 28 august 2012 updated : 11:43 est , 30 august 2012 when it first hit the shelves back in 2009 , @entity1 was an instant hit			2
it was n't long before the space western picked up numerous awards , including @entity8 , for seamlessly blending role - playing elements with traditional first - person gunplay			1
borderlands 2 is set five years after the events of its predecessor			2
back then , the vault hunters exposed the secrets of the @entity16			2
all hands on deck : you can team - up with friends to take on waves of enemies the main baddie is @entity23 who has taken the credit for the vault hunters ' hard work and claimed the wealth from the vault , allowing him to take control of the @entity30 and effectively @entity1 , too			1
the @entity30 has taken the vault hunters hostage , so your mission is to save them and kill @entity23 in the process			2
like in the previous game , there are four playable characters			1
first up is @entity38 , nicknamed ' @entity37 ' who can duel - wield any combination of guns			1
borderlands is known for having millions of weapons - all of which are customisable			1
it 's great to have a character that can carry loads and really make the most out of a fantastic armory			1
then there 's the @entity50 , @entity51 , who has the ability to phase lock			0
this is basically lifting an enemy up in the air and making them an easy target			0
sound of the @entity50 : @entity51 has some cool powers finally , there 's a commando called @entity64 who relies on turrets and an assassin called zero , who uses a sword and a gun to unleash a critical hit on his foes			0
there 's also a character called the @entity75 - which is due to come out post launch as @entity78 content			1
it 's free for people who pre-order the game			0
its main ability is to summon a robot called @entity85 who goes on a rampage killing everybody in sight			0
borderlands impressed critics with its cell - shaded , quirky graphics depicting a @entity93 - style world for the player to explore			1
but things have been upgraded this time around			0
visuals look sharper and characters seem more richly detailed			1
draw distance , as always , is impressive , which helps immerse you in the world			0
@entity1 is at its best as a cooperative shooter			0
here , you can team up with friends and take on missions together sharing loot and weapons			1
like the original , there are lots of vehicles available to make the most of the mechanic			1
what 's brilliant this time around are the large boss fights - which are similar to those found in games such as the @entity118 series			1
we watched as a team took on a huge beast , which tried to splatter them all with its ferocious tentacles			2
levelling up is key here and inexperienced players will die very quickly			0
weird and wonderful : the world of @entity1 has been made even more pretty do n't expect the boss fights to be short , either			0
developers @entity129 have mentioned some can last up to 20mins - with even the slightest of mistakes resulting in total annihilation			2
we ca n't wait for this one			0
follow @entity0 on @entity136 : @ @entity137 and on @entity138 : @entity139 .			0
