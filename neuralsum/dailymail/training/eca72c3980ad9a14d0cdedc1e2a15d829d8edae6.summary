@entity0 to catch up on all the stats from the big game , including @entity4 's winning goal it is hard to know what was most disturbing for @entity7 : four games without a win , successive home defeats without scoring , another flat performance after @entity13 or the sight of @entity15 assuming the ' @entity16 '			1
@entity15 had been through the full repertoire			1
he yelled and screamed and pointed and stamped his feet			0
he tried to regroup at half - time and made ambitious substitutions in an attempt to jolt his team into life			2
in the end , none of it worked and the @entity27 sank down onto his haunches as @entity29 was prone to do as he watched from the same technical area , perhaps engulfed by the same feeling of helplessness			0
@entity4 leaped above @entity7 's defence to ensure his side came away with all three points @entity4 was congratulated by his @entity37 team - mates after scoring what turned out to be the winning goal for the @entity37 @entity4 was congratulated by two of his @entity37 team - mates after scoring against @entity7 at the @entity41 @entity37 took advantage of @entity7 's @entity44 hangover to claim all three points on sunday afternoon @entity15 adopted a similar stance to what former manager @entity29 became famous for during his spell at the @entity49 outfit @entity37 manager @entity50 celebrated @entity4 's goal by leaping high up in the air on the @entity41 touchline @entity37 were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty when @entity55 appeared to handle the ball inside the penalty area @entity58 competes with @entity37 's @entity59 for the ball during @entity7 's home clash with @entity37 at @entity41 @entity7 winger @entity62 was unable to get the better of @entity37 defender @entity63 - who was making his @entity37 debut @entity7 4231 : @entity65 7 ; @entity66 6 , @entity67 6 , chiriches 4 , @entity68 ; @entity69 6 ( @entity70 75 , 5 ) , @entity71 5 ( @entity72 61 , 4 ) ; @entity73 6 , @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 5 ( @entity76 61 , 5 ) ; @entity55 5			1

unfortunately , the view from ground level was no more appealing for a @entity7 boss fast approaching his first @entity108 , at @entity109 , on saturday evening			1
@entity110 deserved their first victory of the season and their first at @entity41 since 1984			2
they were solid at the back , industrious , inventive and created enough chances to have scored many more before @entity4 appeared unmarked at a corner to nod in the game 's only goal , in the 74th minute			1
' i am angry and disappointed , ' fumed @entity15			1
' i do n't know the best word to show my feelings			0
we were wrong in the way we played			2
@entity37 arrived here with only two points and last in the table but we need to show respect			0
' at the beginning of the game we were too slow , we moved the ball too slowly			2
we need to play quicker			0
we need to show more			0
there was a lack of movement			0
you need to be aggressive			0
the way we played brought risk into the game			1
' the game after a @entity142 fixture can often be a good time to play @entity7			1
they lost six out of 12 , last season , and were sluggish , even though there were 10 changes and only @entity65 remained from the team which started against @entity149 in @entity150 on thursday			1
' it 's not an excuse , ' said @entity15			1
@entity7 were especially vulnerable defending corners , which they were forced to do regularly as @entity154 conceded several in his determination to over-complicate things in tight defensive areas			1
@entity88 headed over from the first of the day and @entity63 , impressive on his debut , his first game in six months , caught a half - volley sweetly on the turn which seemed destined for the roof of the net until it smashed into @entity88 's head			1
@entity65 kept out @entity167 's fizzing drive after a short corner routine and the visitors had a strong appeal for a penalty rejected , also corner			2
@entity88 met @entity4 's set - piece with a diving header , glancing the ball towards goal only to see it blocked by an outstretched hand belonging to @entity55			1
@entity74 of @entity7 controls the ball while @entity37 midfielder @entity4 watches on @entity94 of @entity37 scores a disallowed goal as @entity7 defender @entity66 closes the forward down @entity7 striker @entity55 failed to make any real impact against a sturdy @entity37 back - line @entity7 boss @entity15 will be disappointed with his side 's display against the @entity37 mins @entity185 @entity7 total 112.5 69.9 @entity74 90 11.9 7.4 @entity73 90 11.4 7.1 @entity67 90 10.9 6.8 @entity37 total 109.3 67.9 @entity91 90 11.6 7.2 @entity4 90 11.3 7.4 @entity90 90 11.2 7.0 data courtesy of the @entity187 , the @entity188 of the @entity189 referee @entity103 waved the appeals aside			1
he also ruled out a goal by @entity94 for offside , although on this occasion , the officials got it right			2
@entity94 was a yard offside			0
discontent rumbled around @entity41 and anxiety gripped @entity7			1
not only were they vulnerable at the back but they failed to create anything of note going forward			0
seventy minutes had passed before they registered an effort on goal , when @entity86 saved at the near post from sub @entity76			2
' there was a moment mid-way through the first - half when the mood changed after we had a period of possession and pressure , ' said @entity50			2
' that can spread around the ground			0
we 've experienced it at home			0
the fans respond to what they see			0
' @entity65 kept his team in the game			0
there was a fine save to keep out a swerving effort from @entity94 after the young striker skipped past @entity154 , and another to thwart @entity4 , but he was finally beaten			1
appropriately it came from a corner			0
it was taken by @entity91 from in front of the @entity37 fans who booed him during a home defeat by @entity233 , and converted by @entity4 , who is not the tallest of players but escaped the attention of @entity73 to nod in			1
@entity7 mustered a late flurry but @entity37 hung on without fuss			2
having arrived rock bottom of the @entity189 , they left with their first win of the @entity189 season and a weight hoisted from their shoulders as they prepare for home games against @entity245 , in the @entity246 , and @entity247			2
' i 'd be lying if i said there was n't an element of relief , ' said @entity50			0
' but the over-riding emotion is real pleasure , for players , club as a whole and for our fans			0
it 's great to get that first win			0

@entity15 's side appeared to be suffering from yet another @entity44 hangover
@entity4 scored the only goal of the game in the 74th minute
@entity7 played out a 0 - 0 draw with @entity149 on thursday night
