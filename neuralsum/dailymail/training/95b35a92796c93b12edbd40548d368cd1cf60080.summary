builder 's tea has long been @entity3 's favourite cuppa , but more of us are choosing herbal teas instead			1
sales of fruit and herbal tea have shot up 15 per cent in the past year			1
but at 6p a bag , compared to 2p for @entity11 , they 're not cheap			1
so , can you make your own herbal teas - and what do they taste like ? @entity15 took the @entity17 brew challenge ... home brew : @entity15 with her @entity17 herbal teas why drink it ? recommended as a cleansing tonic , nettle tea is supposed to be especially beneficial to the liver and kidneys			1
it can help soothe eczema and irritated or inflamed rashes and skin conditions			2
easy to source ? i live in the countryside and can barely set foot outside without encountering nettles - but what mad fool would go anywhere near them ? i don gardening gloves and set off brandishing a pair of shears			2
cost : @entity39 how to make it : back home - and still wearing gardening gloves to protect my hands - i pick off ten of the youngest leaves and dunk them in a colander , washing them under running water to get rid of any dust and dirt			1
i transfer the leaves to the teapot , add boiling water and steep for ten minutes			2
tea - licious ? an unappetising green colour , the tea stinks of rotting vegetation			2
i have to hold my nose to take a sip , then throw the rest away			2
it tastes nothing like shop - bought nettle tea , which is pleasantly earthy			2
to add insult to injury , i get stung by the nettles when cleaning the pot. so , nettle tea is good for the skin ? mine is covered in itchy stings			2
rating : 0/10 go forage : the ingredients can all be found outdoors - but some taste better than others when brewed why drink it ? @entity76 is reputed to soothe stomach cramps , spasms and bloating , calm nausea and headaches			1
easy to source ? the mint in my herb garden is well past its best , so i buy a new pot plant from my local garden centre for £ 3			1
with a supermarket peppermint teabag costing around 8p , that 's a big investment			1
cost : £ 3 for ten cups			2
how to make it : apparently , the leaves taste best if they 're picked and dried for 24 hours beforehand , so i snip off two large handfuls , rip them to release the aroma and lay them on a tray in my kitchen			1
when my leaves are dry and crunchy , i put them in my teapot , pour boiling water over and infuse for 20 minutes			2
tea - licious ? it smells like cheap mouthwash , but tastes pleasantly refreshing			1
at this price , though , it 's cheaper to buy my mint tea at the supermarket - a box of 20 bags cost 80p in @entity110			1
rating : 7/10 time for a cuppa : @entity15 found the fennel tea the tastiest why drink it ? @entity115 leaves and petals are supposed to be good for treating fluid retention and urinary tract infections			2
@entity115 is rich in potassium - which is good for the heart , blood pressure and efficient energy conversion			2
it is also a liver tonic			0
easy to source ? one look at my lawn and it 's obvious i could provide an entire street party with dandelion tea			1
i pull up two armfuls in no time			0
how to make it : i select ten of the youngest and freshest leaves , wash them in running water , then dunk in my teapot of boiled water and leave for 15 minutes			1
tea - licious ? once i 've got over the marshy smell , i 'm impressed by the taste			0
it 's slightly bitter , but refreshing			1
rating : 6/10 why drink it ? an infusion of lavender flowers is good for a hangover , while soothing the digestive system and assisting the liver			0
the blackberry leaves add sweetness			0
easy to source ? i have three lavender beds in my garden and snipping off the heads takes a matter of minutes			1
there are lots of blackberry leaves in nearby hedgerows , but removing them with my bare hands means my fingers look like a pin cushion			0
you can buy dried lavender and blackberry leaves online - but at £ 3.50 for 15g of dried lavender and £ 2.94 for 250g of blackberry leaves , these can be expensive			0
cost ? nil from my garden			1
how to make it : i chop up 2tbsp of lavender florets and the beautiful smell fills the kitchen			1
i feel better already as i add a handful of the leaves , then steep in boiling water for ten minutes			0
tea - licious ? my tea is a pretty pink and smells sensational			0
the lavender smell is so intense it 's like holding my head over neat lavender oil			1
sadly , that 's exactly what it tastes like			1
it 's so sticky i want to gag			1
the blackberry leaves are horribly bitter			0
rating : 0/10 sourced from nature : save money on shop bought tea bags by picking your own nettles , mint and blackberries why drink it ? @entity198 is supposed to help hayfever and asthma sufferers			0
it is also useful for calming stomach spasms and easing indigestion , bloating and hiccups			0
a cup before bed is also said to help a good night 's sleep			1
easy to source ? you can buy dried camomile flowers online ( £ 1.80 for 50g ) , but i am keen to forage for my own			0
sadly , i would n't know it if i fell over it , so i contact the @entity214			0
their local expert tells me i need to head to the @entity217 , 20 miles from my @entity219 home , where it still grows wild in patches			0
they provide me with an @entity224 reference and tells me camomile looks like a tiny daisy			0
two hours later , i 'm wading through cow pats , night is falling and i 'm exhausted			0
eventually i spot a few clumps of what i assume is camomile			0
it 's supposed to have a sweet , apple - like aroma - mine stinks of manure			1
how to make it : as with most flower teas , the taste is more intense if you dry the flowers			1
you can then store it for up to six months in an airtight container			0
instead , i wash the flowers to remove any dirt , then pop 2tbsp into my teapot with boiling water			0
it infuses for 15 minutes			0
tea - licious ? this is so refreshing and pleasant that , as i take my first sip , i manage to banish all thought of the germs that might still be clinging to those dungy camomile flowers			0
i sleep like a baby - and i do n't think that 's just because of my march through the @entity217			1
rating : 7/10 why drink it ? a spicy tea recommended for relieving windy digestive systems , it is also a folk remedy for relieving the aches and pains of flu			0
easy to source ? i buy a jar of fennel seeds from my local supermarket for £ 1			0
cost ? £ 1 for 13 cups of tea			0
how to make it : i use a pestle and mortar to crush 1tsp seeds , then leave them to infuse in boiled water for ten minutes			1
tea - licious ? the tea smells and tastes every bit as good as a shop - bought version			0
it 's a nice , dark colour with a liquorice - like aroma			2
i 'll need to grow my own fennel to make the home - brew version cost effective			2
