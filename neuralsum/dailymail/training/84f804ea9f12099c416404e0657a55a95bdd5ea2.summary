by @entity0 half - term and holidays make for happy times - but also high levels of tension in relationships			1
being together 24/7 with no respite from each other or the children is n’t easy - which is why i thought it timely to write about how to have love that lasts			1
these are the things that i think really count : do n’t try to control each other			1
they are n’t you and you are n’t them so stop trying to turn them into you by controlling what they do or trying to influence how they think			2
be tactful , be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you 're desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument do n’t take everything personally your partner ’s behaving like a right so - and - so ? it could be they just got off the phone from their mother having a rant or they ’re worried about work			1
you ’re not the only person and thing influencing your partner ’s moods			2
talk about the happy times			1
especially when you ’re going through a rough patch			2
remind yourselves of how good you are together when things are normal			1
do lots together , no matter how mundane			1
whether it ’s the weekly shop , washing the dog , eating dinner on your laps in front of the telly , it all counts			2
quality ‘ ’ you two ’ time is important but one ‘ date ’ a week is n’t going to beat spending time together frequently , no matter how routine it might be			1
watch your language there ’s a reason why this is mentioned in every relationship article			1
say ‘ i feel this way ’ not ‘ you made me feel this way ’			2
do n’t make sweeping generalizations like ‘ you never do this or that ’ or “ you ’re always late ’			1
@entity0 says half - term and holidays make for high levels of tension in relationships touch each other constantly			1
both sexually and affectionately – and make sure you know the difference			1
know each other ’s ‘ raw ’ spots			2
be sensitive to vulnerabilities , rather than use them to score points			2
if your partner ’s down , be extra nice and they ’ll return the favour when you ’re not feeling so chipper			2
do n’t always assume the worst			0
he did n’t make the effort to come and see your @entity91 in hospital ? instead of assuming they did it deliberately ask why			1
perhaps they did n’t realise how important it was to you			0
spell out your needs very clearly and do n’t expect your partner to mind - read			1
@entity101 is n’t the best policy			0
to be 100 % honest , you would have to express every fleeting sexual thought you have about others and every negative thing you think about your partner			0
be tactful , be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you ’re desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument			0
do n’t try to change the other person			0
do n’t play the ‘ if only ’ game			0
if only they were kinder , richer , happier , had more hair			0
we ca n’t change other people			0
all we can change is our reaction to them			0
put yourself in their shoes			0
before you react defensively , see it from their point of view			0
do n’t do all the work in the relationship			1
if you ’re always the one who steps in to solve things , you do n’t give your partner the chance to try			1
you feel resentful for doing all the fixing , they feel controlled			0
treat your partner the way you treat your friends			0
we would n’t dream of speaking to friends the way we do our partners			0
fine to shut up until you ’ve calmed down but not speaking for days on end is incredibly damaging			0
the longer you do n’t get on , the bigger the argument becomes			0
you ’re unique , so is your partner and so is your relationship			1
people like me can rattle on all they want but only you two know what works for you			0
