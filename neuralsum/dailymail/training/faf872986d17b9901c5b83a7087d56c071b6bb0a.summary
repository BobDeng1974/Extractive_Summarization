@entity0 and @entity1 followed their former manager ’s career closely after he left @entity5 to go to @entity6 and then on to @entity7 , and have been fascinated to watch him adapt to changing circumstances at @entity9			1
over lunch in @entity5 , the former team - mates discussed @entity13 ’s evolution over the years , and whether this is the year he can finally end his quest for a @entity16 triumph			1
@entity0 : when he went to @entity6 i thought : ‘ what ’s he doing ? ’ his credentials were good , he would probably have got a really decent team in @entity22			1
@entity1 : @entity24 fans wo n’t like me saying it , but i was @entity7 manager when he came to @entity7 and @entity26 was on the committee			1
he phoned me about seven times			0
@entity26 was saying : ‘ i ’m the only one on the board who wants him			1
no one else has ever heard of him			0
’ and i said : ‘ go and get him			0
wherever he goes he ’ll be successful			0
’ @entity13 won @entity36 and the @entity37 with @entity5 before heading to @entity6 's @entity38 in his 18 - month stint at @entity40 , @entity13 won the @entity41 before joining @entity9 the @entity42 and his players : @entity1 and @entity0 return to @entity5 27 years after they won the title there if @entity13 wins the @entity16 i do n't think @entity24 fans will ever forgive me ... i told @entity9 to sign him , says @entity1 @entity47 : he can be a stubborn man			1
that ’s an understatement , would n’t you say ? but he ’s had to adapt			0
i think he ’s been impatient because of the change over from @entity52 to the @entity53			0
he ’s probably as frustrated as the fans and he ’s not had the ability to replace people with really top players			0
he ’s had to work in a different way			0
@entity59 : for me , he built a really good team on the back of the @entity7 back five and with @entity62 and brought in some really good players like @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
but when they made the move to the new stadium , he had to be spot on in his transfers and get four out of five players right whenever he bought			0
that never materialised and that ’s what held him back			0
@entity47 : can he win the @entity16 ? it depends how long he wants to go on for			1
i think @entity9 have improved this year and i think they are a better side going forward			1
it ’s working out the areas and how long it will take him to fix those areas , which are goalkeeper and defence			2
@entity13 took @entity0 ( left ) and @entity1 to the principality and enjoyed instant success @entity13 joined @entity9 in 1996 and success instantly came to the @entity89 in @entity90 @entity59 : the best i ’ve seen them play for four or five years was at @entity92 in january			1
i ’ve never seen an @entity13 team defend like that against a top team			1
they always seem to think they can take them on			0
‘ we ’re better than you technically			0
i find myself saying : ‘ no , you ’ve got to be tight			0
’ one thing they have is pace to break with players like @entity107			0
they used it perfectly at @entity92			1
if they ’re ever going to learn how to play in the @entity16 and certain games away from home , that was the moment			1
@entity47 : i think they had the same experience at @entity116 last year , when they won 1 - 0			1
but i did n’t think they learnt as much from that as they did against @entity92			1
@entity59 : if they get through someone ’s going to get @entity122 or @entity123 in the quarters			0
going forward they ’re better than @entity126 , better than @entity92			1
but for me they have to defend like they did against @entity92			1
@entity107 has added extra pace to @entity9 and the @entity130 will be key to their @entity132 hopes @entity9 defended resolutely in the 2 - 0 win at @entity92 and must recreate that form in @entity22 @entity47 : we were always defensively solid at @entity5			1
he thought we had enough firepower in midfield and up front			2
but he trusted a lot in centre - halves @entity141 and @entity143			2
one was a real stopper and the other could read the game like nobody else			0
that is a massive joker to have in your pocket if you want to play expansive football : a really smart centre half who sees the game very quickly			2
@entity59 : he ’s always had a good spine and i ’m not sure he has a good spine at the moment			0
if you put @entity162 into his team , it would be transformed			2
and he ’s not an out - and - out defensive midfielder ... just a good player			2
if @entity9 get a player like him and a keeper , they have the firepower			2
@entity47 : is he convinced by his goalkeeper ? @entity59 : no , i would n’t think so			2
but i think they ’ll have more than enough to win over the two legs .			0

@entity13 took @entity1 and @entity0 to @entity5 , who play @entity9 in the @entity16 this week , in 1987
@entity1 reveals he told then *chairman* @entity26 to bring the @entity89 to north @entity90 in 1996
@entity0 believes there are question marks at goalkeeper and midfield in @entity13 's *current* team
@entity1 says the @entity186 must defend like they did in the 2 - 0 win over @entity92 to see success in the *competition*
