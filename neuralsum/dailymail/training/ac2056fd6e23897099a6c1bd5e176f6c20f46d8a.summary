adults could be advised to halve the amount of sugar in their diets under new guidelines from the @entity6			1
experts are considering lowering the recommended limit of ten teaspoons a day to just five over fears that it is contributing to heart disease , obesity and tooth decay			1
food companies may have to change their products to lower the sugar content , which would be hugely expensive and could prove unpopular with some consumers			1
touching the limit : a single @entity20 bar contains five teaspoons of sugar a single can of cola contains ten teaspoons of sugar , a @entity20 bar has five , a bowl of @entity26 has about four and there are eight in some ready meals			1
the average @entity30 consumes 12 teaspoons a day , although research has found that some adults in industrialised countries are eating as many as 46 daily			0
@entity35 , president of the @entity36 , which works with the @entity6 , described the suggestion as ‘ political dynamite ’			2
‘ the food industry will do everything in their power to undermine this , ’ he said			0
the guidance suggests lowering the amount of sugar added to food – excluding that which occurs naturally in fruit or starch - from 10 per cent to five per cent of the daily allowance , which is equivalent to five teaspoons			1
high in sugar : a bowl of @entity26 contains around four teaspoons of sugar the policy would almost certainly be adopted by the @entity52			1
professor @entity53 , a cardiologist at the @entity54 and member of the @entity6 panel of experts , said : ‘ i would agree with the recommendation to reduce it to five per cent			2
‘ there is overwhelming evidence coming out about sugar - sweetened beverages and other sugar consumption links to obesity , diabetes and even cardiovascular disease			0
’ the proposals were discussed at a meeting earlier this year after a study by professor @entity69 , an expert in nutrition and oral health at @entity72 , highlighted the danger of sugar to dental health			0
‘ part of the problem is that sugary foods and drinks are now staples in many people ’s diet in industrialised countries , whereas once they were an occasional treat , ’ he said			0
‘ we need to reverse this trend			0
’ the @entity6 panel will consider the guidance over the coming months before making a final @entity90 , an industry - funded research body , pointed out that @entity93 manufacturers had been lowering the level of sugar in recent years to make products healthier			1
‘ there is no data to show that reducing intake below current levels is beneficial to health , ’ said a spokesman , who claimed that the guidance was based on studies ‘ of very low quality ’			0
research three years ago by the @entity106 in the @entity107 found that some adults were eating 46 teaspoons of sugar a day			2
this included six in a bowl of cereal , 14 for lunch including a slice of pizza and a fizzy drink , and 16 for a ready meal in the evening with another sugary beverage			2
@entity118 ’s was criticised last year by the @entity119 for claiming that high sugar was not linked to obesity			0
its @entity26 website claimed : ‘ a panel of world health experts recently reviewed all the evidence and concluded that a high sugar intake is not related to obesity , or the development of diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure or cancer			1
' nor was it connected to behavioural problems , such as hyperactivity , in children			0

@entity6 guidelines recommend halving the current limit
they could mean food companies have to change their products
a @entity20 bar contains five teaspoons of sugar , a can of cola ten , a bowl of @entity26 four , and some ready meals have as many as eight
