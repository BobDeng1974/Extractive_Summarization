by @entity0 published : 05:25 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 2 november 2012 @entity2 's new ipad mini has gone on sale around the world			1
while a few diehard fans queued for hours to be among the first to own the new smaller @entity7 , queues were tiny compared to previous launches			1
in @entity10 , reports even claim that staff outnumbered the customers when the store opened			1
however , queues were smaller than for previous launches			1
the queues at @entity2 's @entity23 store today for the ipad mini ( left ) compared to the queue for the @entity26 ( right ) on october 14th customers form a queue outside an @entity2 store to purchase the company 's new @entity17 in @entity31 , @entity32 experts say bad weather , @entity35 and increased competition from rivals such as @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 could be behind to lack of queues			1
experts believe the effects of @entity35 and the large number of online orders mean the queues were smaller			2
@entity2 fans lined up in several @entity49 cities to get their hands on the ipad mini on friday , but the device , priced above rival gadgets from @entity38 and @entity39 , attracted smaller crowds than at the company 's previous global rollouts			1
@entity2 's global gadget rollouts are typically high - energy affairs drawing droves of buyers who stand in line for hours			1
but a proliferation of comparable rival devices may have sapped some interest			0
@entity2 staff in @entity19 celebrate the launch of the Â£ 269 ipad mini , which went on sale around the world today the @entity71 in @entity72 saw the biggest number of fans , with many dressing up for the occasion @entity72 , @entity76 where many @entity2 fans queued up to buy the new @entity7 mini about 50 people waited for the @entity18 in @entity80 , @entity81 , to open , where in the past the line had stretched for several blocks when the company debuted new iphones			1
at the head of friday 's line was @entity88 , who had been waiting since 4:30 am and was keen to get his hands on the 7.9 - inch slate			2
' it 's light , easy to handle , and i 'll use it to read books			0
it 's better than the original @entity7 , ' @entity88 said			0
there were queues of 100 or more outside @entity2 stores in @entity72 and @entity31 when the device went on sale , but when the company 's flagship @entity10 store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line			1
the queue for the @entity17 at the @entity108			0
@entity109 was first in line to get his @entity17			0
the ipad mini marks @entity2 's first foray into the smaller - tablet segment , and the latest salvo in a global mobile - device war that has engulfed combatants from internet search leader @entity38 to web retailer @entity39 and software giant @entity40 @entity40 's 10 - inch surface tablet , powered by the just - launched @entity119 software , went on sale in october , while @entity38 and @entity39 now dominate sales of smaller , 7 - inch multimedia tablets			1
unveiled last week , the ipad mini has won mostly positive reviews , with criticism centring on a screen considered inferior to rivals ' and a lofty price tag			0
the new tablet essentially replicates most of the features of its full - sized sibling , but in a smaller package			2
' well , first of all it 's so thin and light and very cute - so cute ! " said ipad mini customer @entity134 at the @entity18 in @entity72 's upscale @entity137 district			0
also on friday , @entity2 rolled out its fourth - generation @entity7 , with the same 9.7 - inch display as the previous version but with a faster @entity144 processor and better @entity142			1
both devices were going on sale in more than 30 countries			0
@entity2 will likely sell between 1 million and 1.5 million @entity7 minis in the first weekend , far short of the 3 million third - generation @entity7 sold last march in their first weekend , according to @entity150 analyst @entity149			1
' the reason we expect fewer @entity7 minis compared to the 3rd gen is because of the lack of the wireless option and newness of the smaller form factor for consumers , ' @entity149 said in a note to clients			0
' we believe that over time that will change			0
' reviewers have applauded @entity2 for squeezing most of the @entity7 's features into a smaller package that can be comfortably manipulated with one hand			2
@entity168 , a 20 year - old student who previously queued for 17 hours at the @entity80 store to buy the @entity26 , only stood in line for an hour and a half this time			2
' i had an @entity7 1 before , i kind of miss it because i sold it about a year ago			0
' it 's just more practical to have the mini because i found it a bit too big			0
the image is really good and it 's got the fast @entity179 chip too , ' @entity168 said			0
the @entity7 was launched in 2010 by late @entity2 boss @entity180 and since then it has taken a big chunk out of pc sales , upending the industry and reinventing mobile computing with its apps - based ecosystem			1
a smaller tablet is the first device to be added to @entity2 's compact portfolio under @entity190 , who took over from @entity180 just before his death a year ago			2
@entity193 credit @entity38 and @entity39 for influencing the decision			0
some investors worry that @entity2 might have lost its chief visionary with @entity180 , and that new management might not be able to stay ahead of the pack as rivals innovate and encroach on its market share			2
there were queues of 100 or more outside @entity2 stores in @entity72 and @entity31 when the device went on sale , but when the company 's flagship @entity10 store opened staff appeared to outnumber those waiting in line .			1

new gadget sold out online in hours - but failed to attract the *massive* queues of previous @entity2 launches
many fans decided not to camp out - and instead order online or simply turn up later in the day
reports claim staff outnumbered customers in @entity221
