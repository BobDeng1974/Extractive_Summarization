it was a moment that gave @entity2 ‘ the creeps ’ - standing in the players ’ lounge , awaiting the arrival of football royalty , he had nerves like never before			1
not much flusters @entity2 , whom @entity9 has christened @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , but before @entity14 ’s tussle with @entity15 last month he and @entity12 were given the chance to meet @entity18 ’s most famous son			1
spending time with @entity19 did not disappoint			1
‘ it ’s the ultimate honour because @entity19 is the greatest player of @entity18 and probably the world , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ we only spoke for a little bit but he asked us how things were			0
yes , i got a photograph			0
i ’m going to keep it alongside the one i have with @entity29			0
’ @entity14 midfielder @entity2 ( left ) described it as the ' ultimate honour ' to speak to @entity18 icon @entity19 @entity19 ( centre ) was a special guest for the @entity34 ' league encounter vs rivals @entity15 last month in terms of looking for sources of inspiration , @entity2 could hardly choose two better			1
his ambition is to follow in their footsteps and make @entity18 ’s fabled no 10 shirt his own but , before then , his first task must be to dominate @entity45 ’s landscape			0
there is no doubting @entity2 ’s class			1
look on @entity48 and you will find footage of him bamboozling opponents as a 10 - year - old in @entity53			0
a decade on and the same tricks and shimmies are flummoxing defenders in the @entity57			0
during monday ’s 2 - 0 dismissal of @entity59 , @entity2 produced one moment of skill - a step - over and dummied pass all in the same movement - that prompted @entity65 to applaud			1
‘ when you see the manager trusts you and gives you a lot of confidence it makes you play even better , ’ says @entity2			2
since the turn of the year , @entity2 ’s form and confidence have risen dramatically			2
there have been a number of spectacular moments , particularly in the @entity78 - his goals in replays against @entity81 and @entity82 are the reason @entity14 travel to @entity85 to face @entity86 in the semi-final on sunday			1
@entity65 feels the resurgence of @entity2 , who is on the six - man shortlist for the @entity90 , comes from him feeling settled after signing a new long - term contract at the beginning of february			1
the 22 - year - old does not disagree with his manager			0
unlike the situation surrounding @entity98 ’s negotiations , the discussions for @entity2 were straightforward			2
‘ @entity14 have always shown a great warmth to me so when they came to me with a proposal i did not need to think twice , ’ he says			2
@entity2 ( centre ) scored the only goal as @entity14 won 1 - 0 at @entity82 in their @entity78 sixth round replay ‘ i have always been looked after very well by this club and i am very happy here , so i did n’t even have to think about it			1
my mind is at @entity14			2
’ and so on to @entity85			2
@entity108 expects to feel ‘ the creeps ’ at one of the sport ’s most iconic venues but he is also aware of how imperative it is to deliver			0
he says : ‘ we will try to finish the season on a high but games like this are always tough			0
we have to start well , do our best to play our game			0
it would be important to win the cup , not only for me , but for the club			0
that would be a massive achievement			0
