detective inspector @entity69 , speaking outside the house , said : ' we believe this family are responsible for considerable crime and disorder within this community , and members of the community are intimidated by their activities			1
' we 're here to send a message that this is not acceptable			0
it 's not acceptable that people are intimidated within their own neighbourhoods and we will take action			2
' it must be incredibly frustrating for hard - working , law - abiding members of the community to see people who have no legitimate income living apparently beyond their means			2
' they might be able to afford a nice car or expensive clothes and there will be question marks over how they have afforded that lifestyle			0
' the father and son were arrested as part of an ' intensive assault ' on gangs who allegedly raided ' numerous ' shops and pubs in @entity27			1

before that they can not be arrested or charged with a crime , even for violent or sexual offences			0
yesterday 's operation came two weeks after a number of other dawn raids on nearby homes			0
detective inspector @entity69 said : ' we want the community to sit up and take notice of our efforts to tackle organised crime			0
law - abiding citizens can rest assured we ’re taking strong action against suspects , whilst criminals should be asking themselves : " am i next ? " ' we ’ve embarked on an intensive assault on @entity27 ’s crime gangs			2
these are individuals who seem to think they ’re above the law , are involved in anti-social behaviour and who often " rule " their communities through intimidation			0
no - one should feel threatened or worried in their own community			0
' we ’re determined to cut the criminal cancer from our communities and would urge members of the public to back our efforts by reporting any concerns or suspicions they have to us			0

' one of our jobs in an investigation like this is to establish whether the lifestyle of the person has been funded through crime and if it has , then we will be seizing the property that has been obtained as a result			0
