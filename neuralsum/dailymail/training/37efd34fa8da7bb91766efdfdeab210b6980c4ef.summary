a designer is turning roadkill into high - end fashion in an attempt to prove that it is possible to source cruelty - free fur			1
@entity6 , the @entity7 - based founder of fashion label @entity8 , picks up discarded animal carcasses from the side of the road and turns the skins into a variety of beautiful fur accessories , from leg warmers to hand muffs which are all made to measure and range in price from $ 380 to $ 1,000			1
' it 's so much a part of everyday life to see these animals , ' @entity6 told @entity23 of her decision to start working with roadkill			0
' who of us does n't look away ? you do n't want to see it because when you fully soak in the meaning of what happened , it 's emotionally draining			0
' ' it 's ethical ' : designer @entity34 uses roadkill carcasses to create her designs in order to prove that it is possible to source ethical fur and while some might be shocked at @entity6 's slightly bizarre choice of materials , she points out that more than seven times as many animals die as a result of being hit by a car every year , than are killed for their fur each year			1
according to @entity48 , 1 million animals a day are killed by cars - or 365 million a year - in comparison to the 50 million which die as a result of fashion 's ever - present need for fur			2
' the scale of it is so overwhelming — you ca n't possibly wrap your head around the suffering that went into those numbers , ' @entity6 added			0
so high are @entity64 's roadkill numbers , that there has been a serious increase in the number of people turning to discarded roadside carcasses as a cheap source of meat			0
last year saw a surge in ' roadkill cuisine ' which is being marketed by experts as the ' ethical way to eat meat '			0
when it comes to fashion , however , @entity6 's set - up is completely unique , and something which has been years in the making			2
cash for carcasses : @entity34 's custom - made designs range in price from $ 380 to $ 1,000 having finally decided to take the plunge and set up her business - after returning to the @entity64 following a seven - year stint living and working in @entity88 - @entity6 turned to a local taxidermist in @entity7 , who taught her how to skin the discarded animals			1
' we both had a shot of whiskey , i put some peppermint oil under my nose , and we found a branch in the woods to hang this thing from , ' she said of her first experience skinning an animal - a raccoon which she had found at the side of the road			1
' it was super intense			0
' while the process of preparing the furs might seem slightly brutal , @entity6 's love and respect for animals is evident			0
drawing on her native american heritage , the designer blesses each body with a prayer to honor the animal spirit , before returning them to nature , leaving the animals in the woods near her studio			1
' it was super intense ' : @entity34 asked a local taxidermist to teach her how to skin the animals properly and it seems that the fashion industry is staring to cotton on to the idea of ethical fur ; @entity6 's business is booming and orders for her bespoke roadkill designs are coming in thick and fast			1
thus far , she has fashioned everything from hats to gloves out of her roadkill furs , marking each one with a specially - designed silver disc so that they know it is a one - of - a - kind , ethical product			2
' people need to look at the fur and say okay , that ’s @entity145 , it ’s an ethical fur , ' she says of the distinctive label .			0
