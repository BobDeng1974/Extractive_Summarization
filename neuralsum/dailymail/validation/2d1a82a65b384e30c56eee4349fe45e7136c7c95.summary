for groom @entity0 and his bride @entity2 , their white wedding was to be their best day ever			1
@entity5 - born @entity4 – six months pregnant with their first baby – had splashed out £ 1,000 on a stunning dress			1
and the happy couple had invited over 70 guests to celebrate at a £ 6,000 hotel reception			1
but their perfect day turned into a nightmare when moments before they were due to say ' i do ' , they were both arrested – after suspicions they were having a sham marriage			1
@entity0 and his @entity5 fiancée @entity4 saw their painstakingly planned wedding day transformed into a nightmare when they were arrested in front of 50 guests and accused of embarking on a sham marriage the besotted couple , who had spent months honing the details of their special day , were forced into separate prison vans and held for five hours this week the couple from @entity34 , @entity35 , were awarded £ 21,000 compensation over the blunder – which also led to four police officers being disciplined			1
but although they have since wed , @entity4 , 22 , said last night : ' a wedding day is supposed to be the best day of any woman 's life			1
but this turned out to be the worst day of mine			1
' all the money in the world can never make up for spoiling my wedding day			1
' and her husband @entity49 , 28 , a chef , said : ' while we feel justice has been done we ca n't ever erase the memories of that terrible day			1
there was no excuse for the way we were both treated			2
i do n't think we will ever get over it			0
' the @entity58 , who now have two daughters , @entity60 , three , and @entity61 , one , first met through friends in 2010 when @entity4 came to the @entity63 from @entity64 , @entity5 to study @entity65			1
says @entity2 : ' a friend set us up on a blind date			0
there was an immediate attraction between us and when @entity49 asked if i wanted to go to the beach for a day out i said yes			1
' within weeks we were a couple and talking about spending the rest of our lives together			1
we set a date to marry in the summer 2012			0
' but in february 2011 @entity2 discovered she was pregnant and the couple decided to bring their wedding forward			1
she says : ' when about four weeks after i found out , @entity49 woke up one morning and said he thought we should get married earlier , i was thrilled			0
we are both quite traditional and wanted our baby to be born within wedlock			0
' they were released without charge , and eventually the couple were able to join the rest of their party - whom they had instructed to carry on without them - and bravely smile for photos a registry office ceremony was booked at the @entity92 in @entity34 for july 19th 2011			1
meanwhile , invitations were sent to over 70 friends and relatives to attend a buffet			0
@entity4 said : ' i spent around £ 1,000 on a beautiful long white wedding dress and had my hair and make up professionally done for my special day			1
we arranged for a wedding cake to be made , caterers to prepare a buffet – which included @entity104 and strawberries - hired a @entity106 and taxis to drive the ourselves and the wedding party to the reception , paid for flowers with a florist , hired a photographer and a @entity113 ' @entity49 and i spent hours choosing place mats and table decorations , agonising over tiny details such as which tables guest would sit on			1
we even had our wedding rings personally engraved with matching love hearts			1
like any young couple , we did n't have a lot of money to spend but we 'd saved up enough			2
and we were determined it would be a perfect day			2
' as she was about to walk up the aisle , @entity4 gave a little wave to @entity49 who 'd been waiting			1
she recalls : ' i was so excited when i got there			0
i could n't wait to marry @entity49 and get on with enjoying the day we 'd spent months planning			1
' however , as they stepped into the hall , they were asked by the registrar to go into a small side room			0
@entity49 says : ' i was expecting a chat about the ceremony or something simple such as not throwing confetti everywhere			0
so i was shocked to find four plain clothes police officers waiting behind the door			2
' and when one of them said we were both being arrested on suspicion of carrying out a sham wedding i was stunned			1
' i protested our papers were in order – our solicitor was even a guest at the wedding – but no - one was interested in listening			2
' @entity4 recalls : ' when the officer said i had to accompany them to the station and change out of my dress i burst into tears			1
even my big pregnancy bump did n't seem to convince them we were n't genuinely in love			0
i could n't believe anyone could be so cruel			0
' the couple were taken to the local police station where they were kept in separate cells			1
recalls @entity2 : ' i was forced to wear forensic police clothing			2
' as they sat in their separate cells , and the hours ticked by , both realised their wedding day was not going to happen			1
@entity49 says : ' the feeling of helplessness – knowing my pregnant bride to be was sat on her own in a cell – was awful			0
' they later discovered police found out after only 40 minutes they 'd realised the arrests were a terrible mistake – but it was to be four hours before their solicitor managed to get them released			1
it was too late for their wedding ceremony but the @entity58 bravely decided to go to their hotel reception and posed for photos			2
@entity49 says : ' i 'd told my best man to carry on without us – after all , it was all paid for , the buffet was all prepared			0
we did n't want to let guests down , some of whom had travelled miles			0
recalls @entity2 : ' @entity49 asked me if i wanted to the reception and at first i said no. i was so upset i could n't face it			0
i just wanted to go home			0
but then i did n't want it to go to waste			0
' i even changed back into my wedding dress for photos			2
but i could n't bear to wear my wedding ring			2
and although i was smiling , inside i was devastated			0
in hindsight i do n't know how i managed to get through it			0
' the couple eventually married the next day , in an understated ceremony in casual clothes when the following morning the registrar rang them to apologise and asked if there was anything she could do , they asked if they could still marry			1
@entity4 says : ' the registrar said we could go in later that day			1
by then guests had gone back to work so we just wore our casual clothes , exchanged a few vows and signed our names on the documents			0
we were married but it was terrible - it was not the magical day i 'd always dreamt it would be			2
' the @entity58 tried to put the incident behind them			0
in november their daughter @entity60 was born			0
and they have since had second baby , @entity61 in february last year			0
however @entity2 could not get over what had happened			0
' when i saw our wedding photos i just felt upset			2
although we were smiling on them , they were just fake smiles			0
they became a reminder of the trauma we 'd gone through			0
' worse she began to panic whenever someone came to the door			0
' i knew it was ridiculous but i kept thinking i was going to be arrested			2
i felt i could n't trust anyone			0
in the end i needed counselling			0
' three of the four officers who arrested the couple were disciplined and magistrates awarded @entity2 £ 12,500 and her husband £ 9,000 after the @entity58 sued the @entity251 for unlawful arrest			1
they now have two daughters @entity49 was so angry he made a complaint to the @entity255			0
he says : ' i could n't understand why when the police knew they 'd made an error after just 40 minutes , they did n't immediately release us			2
had they done so , we might still have been able to go ahead with our wedding as arranged			2
' in june 2012 the @entity262 upheld the @entity58 ' complaint			0
a police officer later claimed he had carried out the arrest after receiving a letter from the @entity267 that morning			2
but he had failed to check the @entity0 's documents before making unlawful arrests and detaining them unlawfully			1
three police officers were disciplined over the arrests and the pair went on to take civil action against the chief constable of the @entity251 for their unlawful arrest			1
this week @entity34 magistrates court ordered that @entity2 should be awarded £ 12,500 and @entity49 should get £ 9,000			1
but while the couple say they are ' satisfied justice has been done , ' they have struggled to move on			2
@entity49 admits : ' most couples will reminisce about their wedding day but we never talk about it			1
' and @entity4 says : ' no amount of money will truly compensate for my ruined big day			1
sadly , we can never turn the clock back and undo those memories			0
