confession : @entity1 - branded a ' cynical coward ' in court - was jailed for 11 years six months the devastation he caused created some of the defining images of last summer ’s riots			1
and last night @entity1 – branded a ‘ cynical coward ’ in court – was told he faces a long jail term after he admitted starting the fire which destroyed a historic furniture store			1
the 33 - year - old had long denied burning down the family - owned @entity17 shop in the centre of @entity19 , south @entity20 , during a terrifying night of anarchy			1
but the @entity22 heard that moments before the blaze started , @entity1 had been shouting ‘ who ’s got a lighter ? ’ and ‘ let ’s torch the place ’			1
and as images of the inferno he created were being shown on television later the same evening , a witness said he had boasted : ‘ it was me – i did that			2
’ the fire completely destroyed the 150 - year - old store and set fire to buildings opposite , infamously forcing @entity40 shop assistant @entity39 to jump for her life from her upstairs flat into the arms of rescuers – an image seen around the globe just two days into @entity1 ’s trial , as it became clear his numerous criminal actions on the night had all been caught either on @entity49 , in mobile phone video footage or in photographs , he suddenly changed his plea			1
@entity53 destroyed : fire crews battled desperately to save buildings nearby in @entity56 ' @entity57 ' : @entity1 joined a masked mob as it targeted the @entity61 shop and @entity62 before he set light to @entity64 the father of two had been planning to claim he was bravely trying to stop masked rioters looting the store when it burst into flames			1
yesterday , however , he pleaded guilty to arson recklessly endangering life and burglary			2
he had already admitted burgling two other shops – @entity61 and @entity62 – on the same evening			2
@entity1 continued denying arson with intent to endanger life and violent disorder , and the jury was directed to find him not guilty on these charges			1
he will be sentenced in april			0
the @entity22 had been told that @entity1 , a painter and decorator from @entity19 , ‘ ran riot ’ through the streets on august 8 last year , a night when it seemed anarchy was spreading unchecked across the country			1
first , he joined a masked mob ‘ roaming lawlessly ’ through the town as it targeted the @entity61 shop and @entity62 department store – where he was caught on camera clutching stolen bottles of alcohol as he helped others prise open security shutters to gain access			2
a witness said he helped direct looters inside			0
he was also seen tipping petrol into the street and trying to ignite it			0
@entity1 then headed to the @entity64 store , which was founded in @entity19 in 1867 and had survived two world wars			1
prosecutor @entity101 said : ‘ quite what it was that first attracted looters to these premises may remain a mystery since , unlike @entity62 , which was plundered of clothing and jewellery , few of the rioters could have wanted to steal a sofa			0
‘ it seems the attention this shop received started when one of the mob threw a piece of debris at one of the glass windows			0
lives at risk : one young woman was forced to jump from a burning building near to the blaze at @entity17 devastated : an emotional @entity64 , the furniture store owner , stands outside the charred remains of the shop the day after the riots ruins : such was the intensity of the heat that ravaged the local landmark that firemen had to spend the next day cooling off the smouldering embers booty in hand : @entity1 was photographed carrying items looted from the @entity61 store in @entity19 ‘ thereafter others , including this defendant , joined in until the window was smashed , torn from its housing , and the rioters managed to get inside			1
’ @entity1 was one of the first to enter the shop and emerged carrying a laptop , causing the crowd to surge forward in search of other valuable goods			1
‘ that , however , was not an end to the matter , ’ said mr @entity101			0
‘ having vandalised and looted the store , the defendant was still not satisfied			2
in an act of cynical cowardice , he asked another of the rioters for a lighter and went back to the shop and set fire to a sofa inside the shattered window			0
' the effect , as anyone would realise and as he plainly intended , was catastrophic			0
the sofa went up in flames , as did other pieces of furniture in the showroom , and within minutes the inferno was raging out of control			0
’ the prosecutor said @entity1 remained at the scene ‘ to watch what he had done ’ before the heat and flames drove him away			1
‘ the ensuing fire razed the building , ’ mr @entity101 said			0
‘ such was the ferocity of the blaze that embers and heat from the flames set fire to property on the other side of the road and numerous residents were forced to flee their homes for their lives			0
’ the destruction of the @entity17 was valued at £ 1million , damage to @entity62 at £ 105,000 , and fire damage to nearby tram lines at £ 330,000			0
@entity1 was arrested after he was pictured in a newspaper			2
@entity64 is now trading from another store			1

‘ it ’s been such a traumatic time for us , ’ he said			0
‘ the building ’s been there all my life , i worked in there every day and when i go into work now the building ’s not there			0
it ’s with tears in my eyes when i think about it			0
