by @entity0 published : 12:35 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 2 october 2013 @entity1 was today fined £ 8.3million by a @entity3 court for breaching employment laws related to the treatment of local workers hired on foreign contracts			1
the low - cost airline , which was said to have breached a range of regulations between 2007 and 2010 , intends to appeal the decision			0
prosecutors told judges in @entity14 that @entity1 regularly employed local staff from @entity16 on @entity18 contracts			2
this meant that instead of paying up to 45 per cent in contributions – the normal figure in @entity3 – they paid just 10.75 per cent in @entity18 charges			1
passengers disembark from a @entity1 flight in @entity16 , where the @entity18 air company has been fined £ 8.5million for breaching @entity3 employment laws the court judgement read that this was viewed as ‘ clear social dumping ’ and that the case was ‘ an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation ’			1
@entity1 ’s actual fine was 200,000 euros ( £ 167,000 ) but it was also ordered to pay more than £ 7.5million in backdated contributions for using @entity18 - registered workers at its @entity16 transport hub between 2007 and 2010			1
rival airline @entity39 has already been given fines of more than £ 1million for the same offence			0
lawyers for @entity1 insisted that their crews in @entity16 worked for an airline with a registered office in @entity18 , and pointed out that they spent their working day on @entity18 - registered planes			1
' @entity1 crews were correctly working under @entity18 labour contracts and paid @entity18 social insurance in accordance with the applicable @entity54 employment and social security laws , ' the company said in a statement			2
@entity1 had four planes and 127 employees at @entity59 , near @entity16 , without applying @entity3 employment laws or filling out tax declarations in the country			2
prosecutors had even urged the @entity14 court to symbolically confiscate four @entity65 737s based at the site - a request which was refused			1
@entity1 ceo @entity68 , whose company was today fined 8.3million by a @entity3 court the civil plaintiffs in the case , which include a pilots ' union and a pensions fund , were seeking more than £ 8million in damages			2
@entity78 , a lawyer for the @entity81 pilots ' union , had urged the court to ' make an example ' of @entity1 in its ruling			0
prosecutors said there was no doubt @entity1 was operating in @entity3 , given that it had material and staff based permanently at the airport , and its employees lived in the area			0
' we are dealing with a company whose only goal is to counter the law in defiance of the interests of workers , ' said prosecution papers			1
@entity1 confirmed it had expected a ' negative ruling and a fine ' , adding in statement : ' @entity1 confirms that it will appeal any such negative ruling and any attempt by the @entity3 authorities to seek payment of social insurance payments which have already been paid in full in @entity18			1
' @entity1 has suffered negative publicity in @entity3 over the @entity16 dispute even as it remained the country 's 3rd largest airline , with more than 3million passengers in 2010			1
the court 's ruling also mentioned the airline 's practice of drawing public subsidies in regions surrounding its air transport hubs , typically secondary airports far from major urban centres which allow it to save money on airport taxes			0
' this will serve as a reminder to all those who pay big subsidies to @entity1 that they can no longer support illegal activity , ' said @entity132 , a lawyer for @entity81			0
public bodies that continue to subsidise @entity134 could be ' called to order , ' she added			0
the ruling , not the first airline punished for labour violations in @entity3 , highlights tension between protective local employment law and @entity141 rules on labour mobility			0
the @entity141 's 2006 ' services directive ' grants firms considerable leeway to post employees to work in other member states , though many professional sectors are excluded			0
@entity1 has since shut its permanent @entity16 hub and operated only a summer operation since april 2011 .			0

@entity1 paid just 10.75 per cent in @entity18 charges instead of up to 45 per cent – the normal figure in @entity3
@entity155 said airline 's only goal was to counter law in defiance of workers ' interests
request by prosecution to symbolically confiscate four @entity164 refused
