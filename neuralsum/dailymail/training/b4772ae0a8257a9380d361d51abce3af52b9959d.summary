pollution in @entity3 is now so dense that its effects are comparable to that of a nuclear winter , @entity1 scientists have said			1
it has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated , so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply			1
this process is now under way in @entity1 ’s capital city and six northern provinces , according to @entity18 from @entity20 ’s @entity19 and @entity21			1
@entity18 demonstrated recently that seedlings in @entity3 were taking over twice as long to grow as those in a lab. ‘ every farm is caught in a smog panic , ’ she told the @entity58			1
pollution has been so severe that aircraft have been grounded , roads closed and tourists numbers hit , while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the @entity67 , whose readings in @entity3 on tuesday had alarming results			1
it was reported that the level of @entity74 particles , a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream , reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre , far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe , which is 25			0
vehicles clog a highway in @entity3 , with the buildings around them shrouded in toxic pollution buildings are seen shrouded in heavy haze at @entity90 , @entity92 province @entity1 's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country 's awful pollution			1
the smog , he says , provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry			0
rear admiral @entity101 , a military expert at the @entity102 , spoke days after it was reported that the @entity104 planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the @entity109			1
he said lasers were ' most afraid of smog ' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired			2
' under conditions where there is no smog , a laser weapon can fire ( at a range of ) 10 kilometres , ' he told @entity121 ’s @entity120 ( cross-straits ) current affairs program , according to www.news.com.au			2
' when there ’s smog , it ’s only one kilometre			0
what 's the point of making this kind of weapon ? ' authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased			0
@entity3 has been draped in stinking smog for more than a week and in an effort to cut pollution , 147 industrial companies in the capital had cut or suspended production as of tuesday , according to @entity141			1
city residents are growing angry and alarmed			0
‘ of course , on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale , we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis , ’ @entity143 , the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) representative in @entity1 , told @entity145			1
‘ there 's now clear evidence that , in the long term , high levels of air pollution can actually also cause lung cancer , ’ he said			2
@entity33 , a major industrial region surrounding @entity3 , has some of the most polluted cities in the world 's most populous country			0
@entity37 routinely recorded ‘ beyond index ’ measurements of polluting ‘ particulate matter ’ in early 2013			0
the @entity163 identified the province as a major source of noxious smog that hung over @entity3 a year ago			0
the government said in an action plan for @entity33 in september that it would ban new projects in certain industries , close outdated steel and cement facilities and slash coal use			0
the province has promised to cut total steel capacity by 86 million tonnes , about 40 percent of last year 's production , by 2020			2
official data suggests that is starting to happen			0
new threat : a laser weapon aboard the destroyer @entity182 in @entity183 in this picture from 2012 @entity186 weaponry : a high - speed camera captures the first full - energy shots from an electromagnetic launcher which the @entity104 plans to deploy on one of its ships this year @entity1 rear admiral @entity101 said lasers were ' most afraid of smog ' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired meanwhile , a man in a smog - ridden northern city has become the first person in @entity1 to sue the government for failing to curb air pollution			1
@entity205 , a resident of @entity37 , capital of the northern province of @entity33 , submitted his complaint to a district court asking the city 's @entity210 to ‘ perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law ’ , the @entity204 said			2
the @entity215 recently ranked @entity3 second worst in terms of living environment among 40 major cities around the world and said it was ' barely suitable ' for living .			0

pollution has grounded aircraft , closed roads and hit tourism in @entity1
the food supply could be affected as the smog blocks sunlight
@entity20 showed that seedlings are struggling to grow
the smog is having the same effect as that predicted from nuclear war
yet @entity1 's naval chief *claimed* it has a plus side - *defence* from @entity240 lasers
rear admiral @entity101 said weapons ' range cut from 10km to *1km*
