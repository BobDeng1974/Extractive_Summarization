after a difficult encounter with @entity2 , @entity0 does not deny that @entity3 need to improve if they are going to progress beyond their quarter - final encounter with @entity7			1
‘ the moment of truth has arrived , ’ said the @entity8 and former @entity10 midfielder			1
‘ now we have to maintain the level and get rid of the mistakes			2
’ had @entity2 been more clinical in front of goal , @entity3 could already be out of this @entity18			1
but they survived the many opportunities the @entity21 had , securing victory and their passage to the last eight with a goal from @entity27 only two minutes before the end of extra time			1
must do better : it was a night of frustration for @entity0 ( right ) and @entity3 before they eventually prevailed 1 - 0 against @entity2 and reached the last eight of the @entity18 last - gasp : a penalty shoot - out was looming when @entity27 scored @entity3 's winner in the 118th minute ‘ it ’s very difficult , ’ he said			1
‘ but it ’s not just about what we ’re missing			2
i like to look at positive aspects			2
in a @entity18 that is so difficult , where it costs so much to go through , we have made good strides forward			1
‘ in the second half of extra-time @entity2 had less legs			1
they could n’t attack in the same way			2
we could press higher , and we started to win a lot of the ball in their half			2
but you know that with one mistake you ’re going home			0
’ @entity0 is encouraged by the success the @entity55 teams have so far enjoyed , even if it is the @entity56 from @entity57 he considers the major threat to the ambitions of the so - called bigger teams			1
‘ the @entity55 , while one or two have gone out , have put in a very respectable performances , ’ he said			0
‘ obviously we ’re seeing a very different @entity18			1
@entity55 , it ’s not the same to play in as @entity64			0
roar of encouragement : @entity0 urges his team - mates on during the las - 16 clash with @entity2 in @entity69 getting stuck in : @entity0 tries to win the ball from @entity71 during the encounter at @entity73 ‘ there ’s been an evolution			1
today you have countries who , historically , do n’t have such a football tradition but they ’ve evolved ; they ’ve made a stride forward			0
‘ @entity57 are getting their reward for being a brave side			0
they ’re a team that likes to play , that i love to watch because they never depart from their style of play			1
‘ i said it when they won their first game , against @entity92 ; they ’re a squad who invite others to copy them			0
‘ @entity97 , well , they ’re a fine team			2
it ’s something we knew from qualifying			0
@entity102 has done extraordinary work with very young players with great potential			0
whoops ! @entity0 mis - kicks as @entity3 struggle to make the breakthrough in the second round game ‘ it ’s a bit of a lottery too			1
@entity112 could well have gone through			0
it would have been deserved			0
i think they put in a very respectable display			0
they ’ve grown a lot and , above all , they never deviated from their idea			0
that ’s the identity of a team			2
’ @entity0 thinks it difficult to identity a favourite from the eight remaining sides			1
‘ i ’ve read that it ’s the @entity18 with the most goals , where there are a lot of entertaining games , where there are a lot of great match - ups , ’ he said			1
‘ there are n’t too many big gaps between teams			0
for the supporters , that ’s great			0
i do n’t think it ’s fair to say anyone ’s been a surprise but you have to mention @entity57 , who are doing something extraordinary			0

@entity3 midfielder says ' moment of truth has arrived ' as they prepare to face @entity7
@entity0 and his team - mates struggled to get past @entity2 in last - 16
required a late goal in extra time from @entity27 to secure progress
@entity3 considered one of the favourites to lift @entity18 in @entity158
