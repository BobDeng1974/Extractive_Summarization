by @entity0 denial : sir @entity2 insists a two - tier @entity4 system does not mean a cut in services the disturbing truth of what really happens when ‘ super a&es ’ are created is today exposed by @entity10			1
our research has found that : the country ’s top doctor has said costly staff and equipment should be concentrated in 40 to 70 @entity18			0
professor sir @entity19 , medical director of the @entity20 , said last week it was ‘ complete nonsense ’ that downgrading smaller a&es would be the price to pay for turning bigger ones into super-centres			1
and he argued sending the most seriously ill directly to super a&es , bypassing local units , would save lives			1
but @entity10 – which has vigorously highlighted the danger to patients of @entity4 ‘ rationalisation ’ – has found that recent moves to centralise a&es have led to local cuts			1
the remaining emergency hospitals have frequently been overwhelmed with sick patients			0
across @entity37 there are 197 @entity4 departments			2
sir @entity19 insists his plan will not mean cuts			1
he claims evidence shows rationalising the number that deal with serious heart attacks , strokes and life - threatening injuries will lead to ‘ vastly increased survival ’ for patients			2
sir @entity19 said last week : ‘ this has been described on the one hand as a two - tier system or on the other as a downgrading of a lot of @entity22			1
’ but in the @entity59 , centralising @entity4 services at @entity57 in @entity58 triggered the eventual loss of all emergency facilities in @entity62 , bar the town ’s out - of - hours gp service and a nurse - led minor injuries unit			1
what ’s more , when health bosses closed @entity62 ’s @entity4 in 2011 , they stated the local hospital would retain its @entity71			1
a reassuring leaflet said the @entity71 had : ‘ a highly skilled team of doctors , nurses and other health professionals who are specially trained to deal with patients with serious medical problems			0
’ the eau was particularly important to the town ’s 15,000 pensioners – whose numbers will swell by 50 per cent by 2030			1
but last month , after a three - month ‘ consultation ’ , it was closed and relocated to @entity57 – a total of 13 miles away			1
@entity62 also lost 120 emergency beds to @entity86			2
local councillor @entity87 said : ‘ i did warn that the hospital would lose more of its services if the @entity4 closed			1
some people did n’t believe me			0
the hospital board made promises and then broke them			2
’ he claimed : ‘ if you dig down , what you find with “ centralisation ” is a cheaper service , not a better one			2
’ at least the area kept its emergency beds			1
when managers closed the @entity101 at @entity102 , in @entity103 in october 2012 , they jettisoned 73 of its 153 medical beds			0
the centre – which had essentially been an @entity4 which did not take trauma patients – was downgraded to @entity108 because it did not have enough consultants			1
@entity4 services were centralised at @entity112 ’s @entity111			2
but @entity113 decided not to move the beds to @entity111 as it could ‘ cope ’ with the existing 132			2
it meant that across the two sites , one in four emergency beds was lost			2
managers argued : ‘ we expect the number of beds [ at @entity111 ] to remain unchanged , as we will continue to reduce the hospital length of stay with greater use of our recently developed community services			2
this will allow us to cope with the increased number of admissions within the existing number of beds			0
’ but @entity10 has been contacted by many patients who have spent hours in @entity130 as there were no beds free			1
@entity133 in @entity134 , which , like @entity111 , is 14 miles from @entity102 , has also been hit by the fallout			0
from @entity102 the route to @entity111 is along a winding a-road , while most of the way to @entity139 is on the @entity140			0
yet @entity20 planners thought @entity139 would get only 2,500 of @entity102 ’s emergency patients a year , while @entity111 would get 13,500			0
nine months before the @entity102 closure , @entity133 chief executive @entity143 wrote that the change might have ‘ an impact ’ on her hospital although she said this would ‘ likely be towards the end of the year ’			2
nonetheless , £ 2.5 million was put aside to upgrade @entity139 ’s @entity4			1
but by march 2013 only £ 150,000 of that money had been spent by deeply indebted @entity151 and @entity152 , board papers show			0
the consequences have been borne by patients and overstretched staff			0
like all @entity22 , @entity139 is meant to treat 95 per cent of patients in four hours – but in the year after @entity102 closed , it only reached that benchmark for three weeks out of 52			0
in january , executives were forced to admit they had an ‘ acute shortage of escalation capacity ’ – the whole hospital was too full			1
they drew up a ‘ @entity165 ’ for the @entity4 and built two quick - fix ‘ modular wards ’ containing 28 beds			1
@entity4 overcrowding continued and in mid-april almost three in 10 patients were having to wait four hours or more			2
@entity168 and @entity169 failed to respond when asked to comment			0
a spokesman for @entity113 said that the number of medical beds at @entity102 was cut by 73 , but that 20 additional beds were eventually put in at @entity111			2
she said £ 5 million had been invested in @entity111 ’s @entity4			0
a spokesman for @entity175 & @entity176 said in 2011 the plan had been to keep the eau at @entity62 until a new hospital was built at @entity179 in 2014			0
however , she said the @entity71 had to be removed sooner because the @entity181 project had been delayed and rising clinical standards forced centralisation sooner			0
an @entity37 spokesman said : ‘ our recommendations do not suggest the downgrading of @entity4 departments			1
any suggestion that this is the case is to completely misunderstand what we have said			0
’ seven @entity4 units across @entity37 have been closed – or ‘ downgraded ’ – since 2007			1
and right now , another 15 face downgrading or losing key facilities			0
but senior @entity20 figures believe as many as 60 could go			0
@entity37 medical director professor sir @entity19 claims downgrading smaller units is not part of his super @entity4 plan			1
but as we reveal today , recent evidence shows boosting one hospital ’s @entity4 tends to go hand - in - hand with cutting facilities at another			1
in addition , decisions about how to reorganise @entity4 services will be largely down to local @entity20 organisations			0
@entity37 will only oversee ‘ the big picture ’			0
our analysis shows eight of the current 15 facing closure or losing facilities are in @entity214 – about a third of all a&es inside the @entity217			1
last week , dr @entity218 , medical director for service design and quality for @entity37 in @entity214 , said he thought that scale of change was needed nationwide			0
he said his guess was that ‘ there will be a 20 or 30 per cent reduction ’ in @entity22 taking blue - light ambulances across the country			0
if that happened , up to 60 of @entity37 ’s @entity22 will be affected			0
however , sir @entity19 has made clear that what works in cities will not necessarily work in rural areas .			1

research by @entity10 revealed how one town was **slowly** **stripped** of all emergency facilities as part of a ' super @entity4 ' plan
essential hospital beds cut as part of closures - without being **replaced**
millions earmarked to upgrade @entity4 as part of centralisation plans **unspent**
sir @entity19 said last week it was ' nonsense ' that downgrading smaller a&es would be price to pay for turning bigger ones into super-centres
a town was **slowly** **stripped** of all emergency facilities as part of a super @entity4 plan – despite health bosses ’ *original* promises .
essential hospital beds have been cut as part of @entity4 closures – without being **replaced** elsewhere .
millions earmarked to upgrade an @entity4 as part of centralisation plans went **unspent** , leading to chaos .
