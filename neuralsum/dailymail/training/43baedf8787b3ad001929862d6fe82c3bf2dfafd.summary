police crime figures can not be trusted , official watchdogs ruled last night			1
amid widespread evidence of fiddling by police forces , the @entity2 withdrew its stamp of approval from the data			1
it is a massive blow for ministers who have repeatedly trumpeted that crime has fallen by 10 per cent since the @entity11 came to power			1
mps said the decision could further harm trust in the police , which has already been hit by scandals such as @entity18			1
the @entity2 has withdrawn its stamp of approval on police crime figures the statistics authority says the crime figures no longer comply with its code of practice – indicating the data can not be trusted			1
‘ there is accumulating evidence that suggests the underlying data on crimes recorded by the police may not be reliable , ’ said sir @entity27 , the watchdog ’s chairman			1
he pointed to a warning from the @entity35 that police records appear to ‘ overstate the true rate at which crime has been falling ’ by failing to take into account hundreds of thousands of offences			1
sir @entity27 also highlighted evidence , submitted to @entity43 ’s public administration committee , that massaging figures to hit targets was ‘ ingrained in policing culture ’			0
officers told mps that high - profile and politically sensitive crimes are often reclassified			2
an offence of robbery may be transformed into ‘ other theft ’ and a burglary may become criminal damage to downplay its significance			0
some offences are recorded as ‘ no crime ’ because there is no direct evidence			0
where a mobile phone owner is unable to prove it was stolen it might be deemed lost			0
the @entity35 ( graph showing crime levels since 1981 , pictured ) has already said police records ' appear to overstate the rate at which crime has been falling ' in testimony to the public administration committee , constable @entity71 , who analyses crime figures for the @entity74 , said even rapes , child sex abuse , robberies and burglary were disappearing in a ‘ puff of smoke ’			1
forces were accused of downgrading crimes to less serious offences and even erasing them altogether by labelling them as accidents or errors			1
mps were told of a string of controversial techniques used by officers to cut recorded crime , including ‘ cuffing , nodding , skewing and stitching ’			2
last night @entity93 , who chairs the @entity43 committee , said the inquiry had exposed complacency about crime data at all levels			2
@entity100 mp and chair of the @entity43 committee @entity93 ( pictured ) said the ruling should be a wake - up call for all chief constables he said the downgrading of the crime figures , which are at record lows , should be a wake - up call to chief constables all around the country			1
@entity112 , @entity113 ’s spokesman on policing , said the damning verdict on the police figures was unprecedented			2
‘ it exposes [ home secretary ] @entity120 ’s claim on crime reductions as baseless and out of touch , ’ he added			0
‘ when challenged on hollowing out the police service , with 10,000 frontline police officers axed , @entity120 and ministers have repeatedly hidden behind the 10 per cent fall in police recorded crime			1
’ @entity128 , the @entity113 mp who chairs the @entity130 home affairs select committee , said : ‘ this is an extraordinary step which fuels the concern around the reliability of crime statistics			0
‘ the recent allegations of manipulation of crime figures go right to the heart of the public trust in the police and how crime figures are compiled			1
’ earlier this month , @entity74 commissioner sir @entity142 said there was truth to the allegation from mr @entity71 that statistics were being massaged			0
@entity147 , chief inspector of constabulary for @entity148 and @entity149 , who is leading an inquiry into crime statistics , has said he expects to find ‘ some fiddling ’			0
ex-met commissioner @entity153 has said ‘ fiddling of figures ’ had been going on since he joined the police			0
he told the home affairs committee it was the ‘ biggest scandal coming our way ’			0
last night , @entity161 , @entity162 crime prevention minister , said : ‘ it is vital that recorded crime statistics are as robust as they can possibly be – and this government has a strong record on reinforcing their independence and accountability			0
‘ one of the first things we did when we came into office was to transfer responsibility for crime statistics to the independent @entity35			2
‘ recorded crime has fallen by more than 10 per cent since june 2010 – and it is important to note that the separate and wholly independent crime survey for @entity148 and @entity149 has also fallen by more than 10 per cent over the same period			2
‘ it now stands at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981			0
so the evidence is clear : police reform is working and crime is falling			0
’ responsibility for the production and publication of crime statistics for @entity148 and @entity149 was transferred from the @entity189 to the @entity35 in april 2012			2
but the @entity189 remains operationally responsible for the collection and validation of crime figures from police forces in @entity148 and @entity149 , before they are passed on to the @entity35 for publication			1
police forces are responsible for generating recorded crime data , and each force has a crime registrar responsible for overseeing compliance with standards for recording crimes			1
the next crime statistics are due to be published next week			0
@entity202 , who is the director general of the @entity35 , said : ‘ we have already highlighted our concerns about the quality of crime recording by the police , and the variations in trends between recorded crime and our own crime survey for @entity148 and @entity149			1
‘ i am pleased this has been recognised by the authority			0
’ the separate @entity215 – a survey of around 30,000 households – continues to have trusted status , officials said .			0
