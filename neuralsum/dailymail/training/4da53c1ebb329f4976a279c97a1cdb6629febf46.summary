by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 24 august 2012 updated : 05:51 est , 24 august 2012 @entity1 has moved on from @entity2 , @entity3 from @entity4 , @entity5 from @entity6 and @entity7 from @entity8 , but it 's hard to forget your first love - and easy to look back on it wearing rose - tinted spectacles			2
and now it emerges that one in five @entity14 - and as many as a quarter of all @entity16 men - would like to get back together with their first sweetheart			1
they are no longer together , but @entity18 and @entity19 , left , dated for four years during the @entity20 , and @entity21 and @entity4 vowed to stay together forever after meeting on the @entity23 tv show in some 21 per cent of brits saying they are secretly planning a reunion with their first lover - and men are most likely to carry a torch for an old flame , with 24 per cent admitting they still lust after a an ex. but it is n't just men			1
supermodel @entity18 , who began a four - year relationship with actor @entity19 when she was 21 , said , years after their romance was over ( but before she met husband @entity37 ) : ' i just have n't found anyone i want to spend long periods with			0
i do nâ€™t think i 've completely got over my relationship with @entity19			0
' as many as fourteen per cent of people have actually got back in touch with an ex hoping to reignite the passion , and one in six men are still secretly in contact with a former partner			1
it seems @entity51 are the most likely to deceive their current partner , with 19 per cent of people from the capital lying about being in contact with a former lover - and 100 per cent of those who have made contact say they did so expressly to get back together			1
people in the @entity61 and @entity62 are most likely to want to be reunited with their first love ( 24 per cent ) , while @entity62 are the most likely to have attended a school reunion solely to get back with an old flame ( 10 per cent )			0
actors @entity6 and @entity5 dated for eight years before she began a relationship with @entity69 's ex-husband @entity68 although women are less likely to get in contact with an ex , four in ten who do so on the quiet admit they hope to seduce them			0
social networking sites have made it easier to find and chat up an ex , with 74 per cent of women using @entity79 to link up with an old lover			1
men , meanwhile , are much more likely to keep in touch through email ( 33 per cent ) or text ( 31 per cent )			1
but psychologists have warned that putting old relationships on an imaginary pedestal and attempting to reignite them is unhealthy and can be emotionally damaging			1
@entity7 and @entity89 - here starring in @entity90 ( 1993 ) - dated for three years in the early @entity20 , with @entity91 allegedly losing her virginity to the latter - day mr @entity93 psychologist professor @entity94 , of @entity95 , said : ' our first love tends to leave a big emotional imprint			2
it tends to be a powerful experience and the memory sticks with us as a reminder of more carefree , uninhibited days			0
' we forget the jealousy and the heartbreak and tend to view those days through rose - tinted spectacles			0
but it 's a mistake to think that 10 or 20 years down the line it could ever be the same , as our circumstances change and we have greater responsibilities			0
' these people , particularly men , who pine after their first love are probably doing so because they 're unhappy about something in their current relationship but are afraid to confront it			2
' it is escapism and avoidance and it 's not healthy			0
we may have children and mortgages now and that is n't going to change just because we see an old flame again			0
' men are more likely to fall into this bracket because they are less monogamous and they have lower emotional intelligence than women			1
' social networking sites have made contact with old school friends and old flames so much easier and keeping this kind of thing secret no doubt adds to the excitement			1
' but it 's a real mistake because it will all come out in the end			0
' because of the very human tendency to look back on the past through rose - tinted spectacles , as many as one in five women and one quarter of all men would like to get back together with their first love the study was carried out to mark the @entity149 release of movie @entity150 : reunion .			2

men most likely to want this because they ' have a lower emotional intelligence ' , say psychologists
social networking sites have made the process easier
@entity51 most likely to *lie* about being in touch with an ex
