he now wants to consider sponsoring legislation that would give state police jurisdiction of the state 's alcohol laws			0

his roommate @entity134 said : ' so the @entity63 that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the @entity27 [ @entity27 ] officers was his real @entity63			2

' mr. @entity192 was employed by @entity44 for six months and was terminated by management for cause			0
