compensation for relatives of asbestos victims in ' landmark ' ruling thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos - related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a ' landmark ' insurance liability ruling thousands of relatives of industrial workers who died of an asbestos - related lung cancer will get compensation as a result of a ' landmark ' insurance liability ruling yesterday by the @entity167 's highest court			2
the @entity168 decided that liability was ' triggered ' when employees were exposed to asbestos dust - not when symptoms of mesothelioma emerged sometimes decades later			2
solicitors said the ruling meant that victims were covered by policies in place when asbestos fibres were inhaled - and employers ' insurers would have to meet compensation claims			0
