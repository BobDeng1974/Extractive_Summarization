@entity7 and @entity8 had four boys - @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			0
the couple had wanted a girl but decided their sons ' wives would be the daughters they never had			0
' and that 's what we had - four wonderful daughters - in - law , ' @entity7 told @entity22			0
@entity23 , @entity11 's wife , was the first to be diagnosed , in 2010			2
the couple worked together at the @entity2 and married on @entity25 2002			1
not long after , they had their daughter @entity27 , who 's now 9			0
tragic : @entity23 , pictured right , was the first to be diagnosed , in 2010			2
she lost her battle in 2012			1
@entity30 , pictured left with her husband @entity13 , was next , however she has now finished treatment it was around the holidays that doctors told the family @entity36 had a type of breast cancer that was fairly simple to treat			1
in january 2011 , they told her they were wrong			0
it turned out she had a rare form of breast cancer known as metaplastic carcinoma , which is already considered invasive at diagnosis			1
doctors removed the tumor but the cancer was aggressive and had already spread through her blood system			2
@entity36 finished her chemotherapy in october 2011 and had two good months , including a happy @entity51 that her family will always cherish			1
not again : @entity53 , pictured left , was the last to be diagnosed but is now cancer free but predictably her cancer came back			1
in march 2012 , she went to the doctor complaining of aches and pains			2
she was told the cancer had spread through her bones and she was given six months to live			2
' i think most doctors agreed that she just really never got over it , ' her husband @entity11 said			0
despite the grim prognosis , @entity36 did n't give up			1
she enrolled in a drug trial at a cancer center in @entity69			2
but while two patients on the trial made complete recoveries , @entity36 's cancer got worse			1
meanwhile , in april 2012 , @entity12 's wife , who is also called @entity36 , found a lump in her breast			1
the couple kept it to themselves at first and later learned it was not cancer			2
they were relieved , but her guilt at being healthy when one , and later two more @entity8 sisters - in - law were n't so lucky , gave her a heavy heart			0
' i kept telling her , " there 's a reason â€” maybe there 's a reason			0
maybe you need to be the rock , " ' @entity12 told the news website			0
@entity30 , @entity13 's wife , was next			1
after she turned 40 , she decided to have her first annual mammogram			0
soon it was an ultrasound , a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue			2
' we think this is cancer , ' the doctors told her			2
though hers was in an early stage - 0 or 1 - the diagnosis got worse and worse , @entity13 said			0
after she was told 17 of her lymph nodes were involved , she chose to have a double @entity108 's wife @entity36 was nothing but supportive			1
' the best thing @entity36 ever told me when i was diagnosed was " just because i 've been given my death sentence does n't mean you 're not allowed to have your feelings			1
so do n't feel like you ca n't call me and talk to me about how you feel , " ' @entity30 said			1
i do n't know how she knew how to say that			0
' and she did lean on her sister - in - law			0
scare : @entity12 's wife , right , who is also called @entity36 , found a lump in her breast in april 2012 but later learned it was not cancer in summer 2012 , when she was sitting on her bed with one of her two daughters @entity128 , @entity30 pulled out a chunk of her hair			1
she called @entity36 , sobbing			1
twenty minutes later , she had got her head shaved			0
as she suffered the brutal side effects of chemotherapy and recovered from her mastectomy , she was in a great deal of pain			0
' it 's very hard on a family , ' @entity13 said			2
' it got to where she was hurting so much , if i would touch her or @entity142 would touch her ... it hurt			0
she still has problems in not wanting to hurt her mom			0
' meanwhile , @entity36 's cancer had doubled while she was on the drug trial			1
with little left that doctors could try , @entity36 decided to come home			1
and she and @entity11 , with their family and friends around them , renewed their vows			2
after almost 10 years of marriage , they wed again at the @entity157 in @entity158 , and at the reception @entity36 danced			1
' she had a natural high that whole evening , ' @entity12 said			0
' you would n't think she was as sick as she was			0
' wedding : after @entity36 was given a short time to live , she and @entity11 , with their family and friends around them , renewed their vows after a final family vacation in @entity168 in july , @entity36 started losing her vision and doctors found a tumor behind her eye			1
they decided to bring hospice care into their home			0
she passed away on september 26 , 2012 , aged 52 , surrounded by her family			1
' i never saw her not upbeat , ' her father - in - law , @entity7 told the newspaper			0
' even though she was so down , she kept it to herself if she felt bad			0
she kept cheering us up , too			0
we wanted to keep her spirits up , but it was n't hard to keep her spirits up			0
she was a special person			0
' just days later , @entity30 finished her chemotherapy			1
she threw a party to celebrate with 60 friends , and toasted her brave sister - in - law			0
' it was still very hard with her not being there because her death was still very fresh and raw			0
i still carry that with me , ' she said			0
but the family 's battle with breast cancer was not over			1
mastectomy : after @entity30 , @entity13 's wife , turned 40 , she decided to have her first annual mammogram			2
soon it was an ultrasound , a biopsy and then doctors were taking a sample of her breast tissue on october 10 , 2012 , @entity10 's wife @entity53 went to get a mammogram after discovering a lump on her breast a few months earlier			1
her mother and grandmother had had the disease , and having watched @entity36 and @entity30 fight so valiantly , she was understandably scared			1
on october 17 , @entity10 's birthday , @entity53 was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
' it was a big surprise to all of us , especially since it was a few weeks after @entity36 's service , ' @entity11 said			2
' we 're like , " three , in the same family , yet not blood relatives			0
how does that happen ? " ' @entity53 had eight rounds of chemotherapy over the next few months and opted to remove the lump , rather than undergo a full mastectomy			2
she lost her hair , and her children , @entity227 and @entity228 , cut theirs short to show their support			0
however , her hair has now grown back			0
supportive : @entity30 , pictured , said @entity36 was nothing but supportive and told her ' just because i 've been given my death sentence does n't mean you 're not allowed to have your feelings ' @entity53 finished her chemotherapy in may , 2012 and radiation in august			1
' we 're going to say i 'm cancer free , ' @entity53 told the news website			1
meanwhile , on january 31 this year , @entity30 had her last radiation treatment on and doctors told her simply : ' go live your life			1
' the @entity246 hope their harrowing story will encourage other women to get regular mammograms and inspire breast cancer sufferers to fight hard for their families			1
' if you do get the worst of it , you 've just got to fight , ' @entity53 said			2
' you 've got to take it and fight like a girl because there 's not a female who wo n't fight to the death for her family			0
you 've just got to fight for your life for your family			2
' today , three pink ribbons made from wood sit outside @entity7 and @entity8 's home , representing the three ' wonderful daughters - in - law ' who , despite only being related through the brothers they married , shared so much more .			1

@entity2 women , @entity36 , @entity30 and @entity270 , who are only related by the brothers they married , were all diagnosed with breast cancer
@entity36 tragically lost her life in september 2012 after a two year battle but @entity30 and @entity53 are now cancer free
the family is sharing their *sad* story in the hope it will encourage other women to get regular mammograms and inspire breast cancer sufferers
