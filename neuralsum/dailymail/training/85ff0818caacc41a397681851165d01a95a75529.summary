@entity2 's biggest offshore wind farm with turbines up to 650ft high will dwarf views of the @entity6 , the @entity0 has warned			0
nearly 200 towers , spanning an area larger than @entity9 , are proposed just nine miles off @entity11 ’s unique @entity10			1
but in an explosive letter to the government , the @entity0 ’s @entity14 ( @entity15 ) has said the project would significantly affect the coastline and could threaten its status as @entity20 ’s only natural @entity19			1
@entity15 insists that the £ 3.5 billion @entity23 - @entity22 development – with up to 194 turbines , each the height of @entity27 ’s ‘ @entity28 ’ building – will ‘ dominate ’ the area and change the seascape for ever			1
local opponents to the plan say it will devastate tourism in the area			0
@entity15 director @entity34 wrote to the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) which is responsible for managing the @entity19 along 95 miles of the stunning @entity11 and @entity37 coastline			1
earlier this year , @entity35 claimed to @entity15 that the government - backed wind farm would have little impact on the @entity10			1
but @entity15 has commissioned its own advisory study and in a strongly worded letter seen by the @entity43 , mr @entity34 said it ‘ considers the project will have a significant impact on the natural setting of the property ( the @entity10 ) , in that it would adversely impact on important views ’			1
nearly 200 towers , spanning an area larger than @entity9 , are proposed just nine miles off @entity11 's unique @entity10 he went on : ‘ the project would replace the @entity6 as the dominant feature on the horizon			1
' this is likely to significantly impact on visitors ’ experience and appreciation of the property which could compromise the long - term sustainability of the management of the property			2
‘ any potential impacts on this natural property are in contradiction to the overarching principle of the @entity19 ... the property will change from being located in a natural setting largely free from human - made structures to one dominated by human - made structures			2
’ should the proposal be given the go - ahead , the developers expect the first turbines to come online in 2019 and provide power for 700,000 homes			2
dr @entity75 , of opposition group @entity76 , said : ‘ the @entity22 wind farm would completely change the character of views from @entity80 near @entity81			0
‘ the decision by the @entity83 in 2009 to designate this zone so close to @entity20 ’s only natural @entity19 , two areas of @entity86 and a national park , was extremely surprising			2
’ impact assessments carried out by @entity22 itself found that up to a third of visitors could be deterred from holidaying in the area during the construction phase			0
and once the wind farm is in operation , 14 per cent of visitors said the loss of view would prevent them from returning			0
@entity102 council ’s head of tourism @entity103 said that could mean thousands of people losing their jobs			0
‘ we ’re very concerned			0
if the figures that @entity76 is using are right , it would devastate tourism and result in massive unemployment , ’ he added			0
last night , @entity112 , project director at @entity22 , said : ‘ we are aware of the letter from @entity15 to the @entity35			1
' we will be seeking further clarification as the interim comments are not aligned with the independent impact assessment or the conclusion of @entity35			0
