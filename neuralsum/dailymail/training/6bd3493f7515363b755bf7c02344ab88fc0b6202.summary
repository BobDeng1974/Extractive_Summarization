by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 06:03 est , 18 february 2013 a government official who sparked outrage by marrying a child bride could be sacked after divorcing her by text message four days into their marriage			1
@entity7 , 40 , chief of @entity9 district in @entity11 province , @entity12 , was already married with two children when he wed the young girl			2
in another case that highlights attitudes towards women 's rights in the @entity20 country , a judge joked during a supreme court job interview that women might enjoying being raped			1
outcry : @entity12 official @entity7 divorced his child bride by text message four days after their wedding but both officials are now at risk of losing their jobs , which has been seen as a small step forward by campaigners			1
the supreme court has recommended the president dismiss @entity7 for violating the marriage law , and police are investigating the case because it involves a minor			1
the country 's judicial commission has also called for judge @entity41 to be sacked for his comments about rape			1
unregistered polygamous marriages , such as @entity7 's , are common in the archipelago			1
although divorce by text message is rare , it is allowed under @entity50 sharia law			2
his ex-wife @entity51 , who was the legal age of 16 when she married him , denied his claims that she was not a virgin			0
a photo of the wedding last summer was posted on the internet and caused a public outcry in the local media and on @entity61 , blogs and @entity63			2
. divorce : @entity51 was just 16 when she married @entity7 and has denied his claims that she was not a virgin thousands of people took to the streets in december to protest , with student and women 's rights activists demanding he resign			1
protesters trampled and spat on photos of his face before setting them ablaze outside the council building in @entity9			0
president @entity76 responded by issuing a rare public condemnation of the 40 - year - old official and his illegal marriage			1
there has also been anger last month over the comments made by judge @entity41 at a parliamentary selection panel for a supreme court position			1
anger : judge @entity41 joked during a supreme court job interview that woman ' might enjoy ' being raped he said it could be a mistake to impose the death penalty for rape because both the attacker and the victim ' might have enjoyed ' it			1
the remark reportedly drew laughter from panel members			0
@entity97 later apologised and said he had been joking			2
not only was @entity97 rejected for the job , but the country 's @entity99 recommended that he be dismissed from his position on the @entity103 high court			1
but the supreme court would have to agree , and it has said such punishment would be too severe because he made the remark in an interview , not during a trial			1
@entity110 , of the commission on violence against women , said : ' enough is enough ! ' our officials should no longer mess around and issue ridiculous statements even as a dumb joke			2
' women in the social - media - obsessed country have been rallying , online and on the streets , against sexists comments and attacks on women for some time			2
the movement in a country of 240 million people , most of whom practice a moderate form of @entity50 , appears to be having some impact on the largely secular government			0
@entity110 added : ' we are living in a different era now			0
now we have supporting laws and social media to bring severe consequences and social sanctions			0
' but rights groups argue the country remains far behind on many issues involving gender equality and violence			2
rape cases often are not properly investigated , and victims are sometimes blamed			0
in 2011 , after a woman was gang raped on a minibus , then - @entity152 governor @entity151 drew protests after warning women not to wear miniskirts on public transportation because it could arouse male passengers			1
@entity151 lost his re-election bid last year			0
a sex - trafficking case involving a 14 - year - old girl prompted education minister @entity162 to say last year that not all girls who report such crimes are victims			0
he said : ' they do it for fun , and then the girl alleges that it 's rape			2
' his response to the criticism he received was that it 's difficult to prove whether sexual assault allegations are ' real rapes			0
' changing views : the fact both officials are at risk of losing their jobs shows a change in attitudes in @entity12 growing concern in @entity12 over women 's rights reflects that in @entity184 , where a brutal and deadly @entity186 gang rape in december has drawn nationwide protests and demands for change			1
that case also resonated in @entity12			0
' let 's imagine the suffering of women who are treated badly by their husbands and the rape victims			2
what if it happened to our own families ? ' said @entity200 , a women 's rights activist in @entity201 , capital of @entity11 province			1
' we need government officials who will be on the front line to protect women , and judges who can see that violence against women is a serious crime			2
' in the @entity11 official 's case , it was the text - message divorce that prompted outrage more than his unregistered second marriage , though such weddings raise issues about women 's rights			1
they are regularly performed for @entity12 ranging from poor rice farmers to celebrities , politicians and @entity50 clerics			0
polygamy remains common in many @entity50 countries , based on @entity50 teachings that allow men to take up to four wives			0
in @entity12 , men are allowed to marry a second wife only after the first gives her blessing			0
since most women refuse to agree to share their husbands , unregistered ceremonies , or ' nikah siri , ' are often secretly carried out by an @entity50 cleric outside the law			0
women 's rights : protesters in @entity9 , @entity11 , demanded in december that @entity7 is sacked over the divorce some of the marriages are simply a cover for prostitution			1
a cleric is paid to conduct ' contract marriages ' as short as one night in some parts of @entity12 , usually for @entity245 tourists			0
practices differ slightly elsewhere , with men in places such as @entity249 sometimes marrying outside the country to avoid informing existing spouses and seeking permission from an @entity50 court			0
ceremonies in @entity255 are often held in secret for the same reason			0
no approval is needed in the @entity260 territories , but contract marriages are banned			0
without a marriage certificate , wives lack legal rights			2
children from the marriage are often considered illegitimate and are typically not issued birth certificates , creating a lifetime of obstacles ranging from attending schools to getting a passport			0
however , in another sign of @entity12 's changing attitudes , the supreme court this month ordered all judges to obey an earlier constitutional court ruling granting rights such as inheritance to children born out of wedlock , and to punish fathers who neglect them			1
the women 's commission on violence is now pushing for a revision of @entity12 's 1974 marriage law to grant more protections to women and children			1
' i hope @entity12 women can take a lesson from @entity7 's case , ' said @entity294 of the commission			1
' at least it has awakened their awareness to not marry in an illegal way			0

the fact both could be fired shows attitudes to women 's rights are changing
government official @entity7 left his wife four days after their wedding
president @entity76 issues a rare public condemnation
the marriage had sparked outrage and was greeted with angry protests
judge @entity97 joked about rape at supreme court job interview
judicial commission has recommended he is fired from his high court job
