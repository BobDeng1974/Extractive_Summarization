an advert for a @entity2 machine due to air in a prime slot on @entity5 was pulled at the last minute - because it encouraged viewers to shun bottled soft drinks to help save the environment			1
the commercial for the soda maker was to be screened during a break in last night 's episode of i 'm a celebrity ... @entity14 , but a watchdog decided it could not be aired because it was unfairly critical of the soft drinks industry			1
@entity2 @entity17 branded the decision to pull its ad - which shows familiar looking plastic bottles of fizzy drinks exploding as people hit the button on the machine - ' absurd '			1
each time somebody presses the button on the soda maker , rows of plastic bottles are seen disappearing , sending the fizzy contents pouring on to the ground			1
the firm said it had hoped to deliver a ' powerful message ' about waste and sustainability with its new campaign , which ends with the line : ' with @entity2 , you can save 2,000 bottles per year '			2
but just before the campaign was due to hit screens , @entity51 , the organisation that pre-approves @entity17 tv advertising , decided the commercial was unsuitable			1
' absurd ' : @entity2 @entity17 said it would push to get @entity51 to reverse its decision not to approve the commercial disappearing bottles : @entity51 said the commercial ' denigrated ' the bottled drinks industry sustainable : @entity2 @entity17 insisted it had not named or disparaged any competitors in its advert the advert was due to air during last night 's episode of i 'm a celebrity ... @entity14 @entity2 said it was told by @entity51 that the advert could be seen to encourage consumers not to go to supermarkets and buy soft drinks , but instead to help save the environment by buying a soda making machine			1
@entity72 , managing director of @entity17 , said : ' this decision is absurd			0
we have neither named nor disparaged any of our competitors in the industry and can not see how this makes any sense			0
she said the decision appeared to give priority to ' soft drink giants ' over concern for the environment			2
' through the ad , we are simply displaying an alternative way to living more sustainably and illustrating one of our product 's benefits - the reduction of plastic bottle wastage , ' she said			0
' the consumer should be allowed to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and the products to choose			0
' the company intends to push for the decision to be reversed			0
although @entity2 said it was informed the environmental message in its advert was partly to blame for it being pulled , @entity51 said last night that environmental issues were ' not relevant ' to its decision			1
@entity51 said in a statement : ' @entity2 submitted a finished filmed ad to us for approval on tuesday 20th november without a pre-production script			2
' on thursday 22nd november we had been able to review it against the @entity110 code and concluded we were unable to approve it			0
' in our view , its visual treatment denigrated other soft drinks which put it in breach of the @entity110 code			2
' the organisation said that should @entity2 put forward an amended version it would work with the firm to agree an ' acceptable treatment '			0
