the champ : @entity1 most recently hit the headlines after beating @entity165 boxer @entity164 in a high profile fight in @entity167 last december fighter : after the fight @entity164 , right , was banned from the sport following a televised brawl with @entity175 after the fight @entity164 was banned from the sport following a televised brawl with @entity175 who had recently lost his @entity179 title to @entity1 's younger brother @entity180			1
people in large swathes of @entity5 speak @entity7 as their mother tongue and the bill would recognise it as a regional language in predominantly @entity7 - speaking areas in the heavily industrialised east and southern regions such as @entity141			0
