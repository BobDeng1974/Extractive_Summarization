@entity0 sat in a room at @entity3 's academy surrounded by 39 other youth players watching @entity6 's miracle comeback against @entity7 in the 2005 @entity9 final			1
the atmosphere was charged and excitement buzzed between the bodies			0
@entity0 was 16 at the time and just playing in the @entity14 was a dream , let alone a @entity9 final			1
' in @entity19 when you watch tv you have to choose between @entity6 and @entity20 and i chose @entity6 , ' @entity0 told @entity22 in 2012			1
' i used to and still love @entity23 as a player			2
' @entity25 's @entity0 puts in a typically full - bloodied challenge on @entity28 's @entity27 the @entity19 has been an unheralded but consistent performer as @entity25 rose from @entity29 schneiderlin in training with @entity32 as @entity19 prepare for their friendlies with @entity35 and @entity36 but with @entity25 flying in the top - flight , sitting second in the league , and @entity40 and @entity41 waiting in the wings , playing in @entity45 football 's elite competition is surely not far off			1
when the 25 - year - old joined @entity25 for Â£ 1.2million in 2008 , playing in the @entity47 was a long way from the heady heights of today			2
' when i first came i had no - one who spoke @entity19 so it took me a bit longer to adapt to the style , ' @entity0 added , ' because if you have a good lifestyle it will give you more confidence to play on the pitch			1
' my target was always to play in the @entity14			2
of course @entity19 is my country and i love it , i miss it a bit , but @entity62 is my second home			2
' @entity0 was an ever - present in the side who were relegated to @entity29 two years after joining them , were bottom of the league and docked 10 points			2
it was the lowest , darkest moment in the club 's history			0
it was even further from his ambitions			0
@entity0 celebrates scoring in @entity25 's 3 - 1 win at @entity77 back in august the @entity19 midfielder scored twice in the @entity25 ' 3 - 1 victory over @entity77			1
he has three goals this season yet those experiences have moulded the @entity19 into the tough midfield general he has become			1
even after helping the south coast club secure back - to - back promotions , his displays were often overshadowed by his team - mates in the top flight			1
but @entity0 was always there , always helping the them tick along and was never one to let the lack of spotlight knock his confidence on the pitch			2
ahead of facing @entity6 in december of their first season back in the top flight , @entity0 said : ' i want to confront him and see what i can do against him			1
he 's one of the best players in the world and that 's who i want to play against every game , the best in the world			0
' if i have to tackle i do it			0
in the @entity14 you play against better players so you need to be more aware			2
you need to put the effort in otherwise you get beaten			0
you need to be on your toes all the time			0
i 'm a very bad loser			0
' @entity110 has made an excellent start as @entity25 manager , taking them to second in the table schneiderlin scores in the home match with @entity6 back in march 2013			0
it ended in a 3 - 1 win for @entity25 schneiderlin with a robust challenge on @entity77 's @entity121 during their meeting last season the @entity19 goes toe - to - toe with @entity125 when the @entity126 was still at @entity41 following the departures of @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , it is @entity0 who has emerged as one of the most effective midfielders in not only @entity25 's team , but the whole league			1
@entity139 's @entity138 is the only midfielder to make more than his 43 tackles this campaign			0
his 766 passes puts him fifth amongst his counterparts , behind @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
of those , he has completed 89 per cent			0
and he has weighed in with three goals already			0
before @entity0 , who now has six caps for @entity19 , played at @entity152 for the first time , in that match in 2012 which they lost 1 - 0 , friends back in @entity19 rang him to see if he would get @entity23 's shirt after the match			1
if he starts playing @entity9 football , it will be @entity0 's shirt they 're all after .			1

@entity0 has been consistently good as @entity25 lifted themselves from the depth of @entity29 to second in @entity14
@entity19 midfielder is among top flight 's best passers and tacklers
now he is *hoping* to emulate @entity23 and lift @entity9
the midfield general 's *performances* have often been overshadowed
but *summer* *exodus* from @entity176 's has highlighted his value to the team
