humans have long been obsessed with the idea of machines being able to self - replicate and a number of experts believe they will play an important part in shaping how @entity6 is in the future			2
one artificial intelligence engineer believes that robots could have sex with each other to evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be closer than we might imagine			1
another cybernetics expert told @entity16 that mating robots could exist in just 20 to 30 years while another robotics authority suggested that machines could print off their offspring , a little like how a 3d printer works today			1
@entity23 intelligence expert @entity22 believes robots could have sex with each other to evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be closer than we might imagine			1
he predicts that humans could even breed with machines to create new hybrid species ( illustrated ) opinions differ as to how robots could breed and reproduce in the future			1
mr @entity22 said robots that are both silicon and carbon based , could have sex at a molecular level to produce offspring - although how this could happen is unclear			1
professor @entity40 said that there might not be any need to look at molecules as robots can be ' bred ' by swapping software so that the code used to make robots perform certain tasks particularly well , can be combined to create a ' child '			0
he believes that robots of the future will be able to print their offspring , a little like a 3d printer , but could assemble them too			0
mr @entity55 said if robots could have sex , it would defend them from computer viruses and make them more robust			0
professor @entity62 said breeding with each other could mean robots could evolve at a fast pace , while professor @entity40 thinks the process could take millions of years			0
@entity22 , who is a novelist as well as an engineer , believes robots could have sex with each other to evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be closer than we might imagine			1
mr @entity22 even predicts that humans could even breed with machines to create new hybrid species			1
writing for @entity78 , he said : ‘ perhaps cyborgs of the future may involve human participation in robot sexual reproduction and the creation of new , hybrid species			2
’ @entity40 , professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at @entity87 , however , thinks the future could be simpler and not as ' hands on '			2
while he believes that the future of artificial intelligence could be silicon and carbon - based , with digital brains in charge of organic molecular structures , he told @entity16 that robots would probably print off their offspring , much like a 3d printer can currently be used today			1
he believes the robots might not be particularly intelligent and could be ' bred ' by swapping software so that the code used to create robots that are particularly good at a certain task , can be combined to produce a superior offspring , which they would print out and possibly assemble			1
if robots were able to mate with each other , mr @entity22 believes that sex would defend them from computer viruses , just as sex between humans defends us against parasitical attacks			1
mr @entity22 also said that sexual activity between robots would make them more robust and accelerate their evolution so that new machines could develop faster to suit life on @entity6 in the future			1
if robots were able to have sex , it could defend them from computer viruses , ( illustrated ) just as sex between humans defends organisms against parasitical attacks professor @entity62 from the @entity129 told @entity16 that robots are already good at producing new robots , which are often better than themselves			1
machines breeding with each other - mixing genetically and technologically - could ensure that their ‘ good bits ’ come together			0
this evolution could happen much faster than with humans , as multiple machines could breed together to produce a ‘ super ’ offspring and there is no need to wait for their ‘ children ’ to grow up before they could reproduce			2
professor @entity62 , who works at the @entity144 , said that ‘ just about anything is possible ’ and that there are already robots with biological brains that mix biological and technological parts			0
‘ this is not science fiction , ’ he said			0
he believes that robots capable of breeding with each other could be produced using current research and technologies but it will likely take 20 to 30 years before they could be used on @entity6 – and there are questions to be asked about whether this is a good idea			1
as to whether humans could have sex with robots , he said it is not out of the question but it is ' scary ' and currently ' a sci - fi scenario '			2
however , he thinks that small steps will be taken in that direction			0
currently a lot of people have technology inside them , so research into a human / robot hybrid could had the scope to help a lot of humans			0
such research could be used to give people extra abilities and help scientists understand a lot more about the human body , such as how alzheimer ’s disease takes hold of the brain , he said			0
research into creating cyborgs ( illustrated ) as a result of ' breeding ' with robots , and creating robots that breed with each other , depends on social acceptance , professor @entity62 said			0
he believes that we have to face ethical issues about the use of such technology in just 20 to 30 years time but research into creating cyborgs as a result of ‘ breeding ’ with robots , and creating robots that breed with each other , depends on social acceptance , professor @entity62 said			1
‘ over the next 20 to 30 years the question will be on the table and we have to face ethical issues			2
’ ‘ this technology is not just science fiction – we have to start thinking about it and the ethical and social consequences , ’ he said			0
while research could help humans , professor @entity62 warned that if a robot can self - replicate , evolve and improve more rapidly than humans , we really could end up in a nightmare future scenario			0
‘ why bother with humans then ? ’ he asked , adding , ‘ do we want to get to that point ? ’ the idea of self - replicating robots has been popular in sci - fi , from @entity218 ’s thoughts about machines producing other machines in 1802 , to the popular @entity222 films			0
self - replicating machines have been around since the 1940s when mathematician @entity225 showed how a ‘ universal constructor ’ machine could replicate itself			0
scientists today are working on create self - replicating machines and physicist @entity230 thinks they could be used to cut and move ice from @entity233 ’s @entity232 to @entity234 , where it could be used as a building material .			2

artificial intelligence engineer @entity22 thinks robots could have sex to produce superior offspring
it is thought that robots could ' print out ' their offspring
mr @entity22 suggests that they could breed with humans to create new hybrid species - but scientists warn there are ethical implications
cybernetics expert told @entity16 mating robots could be produced using current technologies but it will take 20 - 30 years before they could be used
