@entity0 believes @entity1 now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend 's @entity4			1
after starting the new @entity7 season in @entity8 with a severe lack of pace , @entity1 and new power - unit supplier @entity5 made significant progress a fortnight later in @entity13			1
although both @entity0 and team - mate @entity14 retired during the race at the @entity16 , the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners			1
@entity0 looks on in the garage during final practice for last month 's @entity13 @entity4 that came as a pleasant surprise to @entity0 , who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend 's race in @entity26			1
' obviously we want to finish a race , but seeing improvement in pace was much more important , ' said @entity0			1
' yes , we both had failures , but i 'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end			2
' to be able to race other cars , and see the @entity38 until a long way into the race , was good			2
' we would probably have been 20 seconds behind them			2
i know they 're not quick , but that is a good step forward for us			0
@entity0 returns to the @entity1 garage after retiring during the race at the @entity16 circuit ' right now we 're comparing ourselves with the @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
' we were quicker than @entity51 ; the @entity52 was on the same sort of pace , and the @entity55 was n't that much quicker			0
' fighting with the pack is important for me			0
it 's what i enjoy and hopefully race by race we 'll start picking them off			0
' despite the positives , @entity0 acknowledges the entire team , including @entity5 , ' still has a long way to go '			2
@entity66 driver @entity0 in action before he retired from the @entity13 @entity4 @entity0 added : ' we need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us , and we still have a lot to do with the power unit , but our basic car is good			1
' if you look at our high - speed pace , compared to the @entity51 and @entity52 , then we are much stronger			0
' so we 're moving in the right direction , and i 'm already surprised we are racing cars			2
it 's great to see			0
' part of the reasoning behind @entity1 's improvement in @entity13 , in comparison to @entity8 , was the high temperatures which suited the car			1
@entity1 driver @entity14 ( left ) drives ahead of team - mate @entity0 in @entity86 @entity0 appreciates the cooler air in @entity26 could have an effect			1
the 35 - year - old said : ' there is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature			0
' that could mean any progress we make does n't necessarily translate to a lap - time benefit			0
' but there is definitely progress being made , and it 's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards			0
' it 'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races			0

@entity0 and @entity14 both retired in @entity13 last month
@entity0 says , however , that @entity1 are moving in the right direction
the @entity4 takes place in @entity26 this weekend
