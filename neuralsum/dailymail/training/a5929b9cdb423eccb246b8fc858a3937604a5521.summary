by @entity0 @entity2 fans may be wondering who new boss @entity3 will sign as the club look to break into the @entity7 's top four next season			1
the 42 - year - old joined the @entity10 outfit from rivals @entity11 on tuesday after an impressive 18 - month spell with the south coast club			1
the @entity14 guided @entity11 to eighth this season as he strengthened the squad with three additions at the start of campaign			0
here at @entity21 we review @entity3 's hattrick of signings at @entity24 's and what type of players the @entity2 faithful may expect in the future			1
shrewd business : @entity3 made three signings at @entity11 before joining @entity2 @entity31 signed for £ 12.5m on a four - year - deal from @entity33 in july 2013			1
he scored zero goals in 24 appearances in all competitions			0
@entity38 endured an injury - plagued debut season			0
@entity3 signed the influential midfielder after the young @entity38 had impressed during the previous campaign with @entity43 champions @entity33			1
the 22 - year - old managed to score nine times in the 2012 - 13 season , including one against @entity47 in the @entity48			2
the £ 12.5million transfer fee was the highest amount that a @entity43 club had received for a player , showing just how much belief @entity3 had in @entity31			1
the midfielder 's first season with @entity11 was a relatively quiet one in comparison to his final one in @entity57			0
injury - plagued : @entity31 made just 24 appearances for @entity11 in all competitions this season @entity61 enforcer : @entity31 ( left ) was signed from @entity33 for £ 12.5million on a four - year - deal in july 2013 the @entity38 suffered a serious injury in december 2013 , during a match against @entity65 - chipping a bone in his lower leg			1
the subsequent incident meant he did not to return until february			0
with his season ruined with injuries , @entity31 failed to score a single goal for @entity11 and will be hoping to be more successful next season			2
@entity74 @entity11 's record signing at a fee of £ 14.6m from @entity77 in august 2013			1
scored three goals in 13 appearances			0
fined £ 40,000 and banned for three matches in january for a touch - line scuffle at @entity82 in december			0
loaned out to @entity83 in january after breaking team - mate @entity85 's nose in a training ground fight			0
the signing of @entity74 turned out to be a very controversial and problematic one for @entity3			2
@entity74 arrived in @entity88 with a bad reputation , having in the past had bust - ups at former clubs			2
the @entity94 international had previously punched @entity77 team - mate , @entity95 , in the face for not passing him the ball during a match			0
@entity74 also had a training ground bust - up with @entity100 whilst they were at @entity102			2
the forward had seemingly put his troubles behind him when he grabbed his first goal for @entity11 during a 2 - 0 win against @entity107 in september			0
the good : @entity74 ( left ) scored three goals in 13 appearances for @entity11 this season the bad and the ugly : @entity74 was loaned to @entity83 after breaking team - mate 's @entity85 's nose the 28 - year - old ’s troublesome past soon reappeared though as he was fined £ 40,000 and banned for three matches in january after getting involved in a touch - line scuffle at @entity82 in december			1
just weeks later @entity74 found himself in yet another training ground fight and ended up breaking the nose of @entity11 team - mate , @entity85			2
@entity74 was subsequently sent out on - loan to @entity83 for the remainder of the season and is likely to leave @entity11 permanently during the summer			2
@entity123 signed for a fee of £ 8.5m from @entity125 in june 2013			1
scored two goal s in 31 appearances			0
part of @entity11 defence that kept 15 clean sheets all season			0
arguably @entity3 ’s best signing during his time at @entity11 , @entity123 has impressed a lot of people with his defensive performances this season			1
the @entity139 international was a vital member of a @entity11 defence that managed to keep 15 clean sheets throughout the campaign			0
@entity123 was also impressive at the other end of the pitch , with one of his two goals coming at @entity146 to give his side a historical 1 - 0 win over @entity149			0
rock solid : @entity11 defender @entity123 ( right ) was signed from @entity125 for £ 8.5million in june headed home : @entity123 ( right ) scored the only goal as @entity11 claimed a 1 - 0 win at @entity149 in september the centre - back may have had an even better season had he not been ruled out for a few weeks in january , after suffering ankle ligament damage			1
his performances mean @entity11 may have a fight on their hands to keep @entity123 at the club , with @entity149 , @entity160 and @entity77 all believed to be interested in the 24 - year - old .			1
