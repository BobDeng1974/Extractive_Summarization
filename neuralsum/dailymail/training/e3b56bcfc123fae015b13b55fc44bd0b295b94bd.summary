@entity18 , from @entity27 and his wife @entity28 met when they were working together 27 years ago be discreet			1
being overly affectionate or making it too obvious in a relationship or even a fling in front of colleagues would not result in a good outcome do tread carefully			0
always keep it at a professional level and control your behaviour			0
if your relationship turns soar - not only will it affect the both of you , it 'll harm the rest of your office or put your career in jeopardy - so be sensible about it do think about the consequences			2
before plunging into a relationship , you need to consider why you 're doing it and whether you can both work professionally and maintain your romance outside of working hours ? do n't involve too many people			0
depending on how it goes in your relationship - only involve your colleagues when you know things are heading in the right direction do n't keep it a secret for too long			1
most people tend to build it up inside because they think of the worst case - scenario if they tell their colleagues but most of the time - it 's a positive reaction and it 'll end those rumours ‘ if you ’re in a relationship at work – my advice is discretion , ’ mr @entity18 told @entity68			1
‘ being overly affectionate or making it obvious with actions in front of other colleagues tends to not have a good outcome			0
‘ and if a relationship goes soar , trying to hide your emotions could have an impact – not only yourself on terms of how you perform in the workforce but it could harm the dynamics of a team environment			0
' whether sparks fly or the chemistry is heating up , mr @entity18 said it ’s important to consider the consequences and what that potentially means for their career before starting anything serious			2
‘ we spend most of our waking lives at work and when you ’re working at a large company and you ’re single – the chances are – you ’ll meet someone because it ’s inevitable , ' he said			1
‘ the real things to consider are keeping it at a professional level and control your behaviour			2
‘ we ’re all here to do our jobs but if you get yourself into a little fling and not much is in it for either of you – do n’t tell anybody			0
not only will you put your career in jeopardy but it could be frowned upon			0
' as long as you know what you 're getting yourself into and it 's not affecting your job - then it wo n't affect me and the rest of the office			1
' the pair have been happily married since with two children after colleagues and bosses attended their big day the 49 - year - old from @entity27 met his wife @entity28 at work many years ago			1

‘ it was important for both of us to focus on our careers and what was more important – we made it clear that we did n’t want to damage the relationship with other colleagues , ' he said			0
mr @entity18 said it ’s important to consider the consequences before being involved in any office romance ‘ you do n’t want people around you to walk on egg shells and we both stepped back and worked as co-workers but after work , we would laugh about how we interacted at work			1
‘ the greatest thing for us was when we started telling people - half had already known but joked they were waiting for the day for us to come clean and others never picked up on it			2
' and would he recommend others to get romantically involved in an office romance too ? ‘ we ’re still together 27 years later and i love my wife more each day			1
we have two great kids			0
how can i not recommend that ? ’ mr @entity18 said			2

‘ it was one of those situations where you ’re working long hours and spending lots of time together – you just grow fond of each other , ’ 33 - year - old @entity188 told @entity68			2
‘ we kept it a secret at first because we did n’t know if it would progress after a couple of dates or turn into a long term thing			0
‘ but overtime , we started to tell one or two people and it grew from there			0
it obviously got serious and people were talking about it so we came out and said we were an item			0
it took the couple six months before progressing into a serious relationship but @entity188 admits it was quite challenging to maintain at first			2
‘ one thing that helped was , we worked in different teams so it ’s certainly different when you ’re working with each other every day , ’ @entity188 said			2
‘ when we started telling people , most of the office had already known so it was the worst kept secret , ’ @entity188 laughed			1

lots of our colleagues came to the wedding as well			0
‘ i think if you ’re serious with each other , then there is nothing to worry about starting a relationship in the workplace			0
' the only negative comment i got was " you 're punching above your weight " , ' @entity188 laughed			0
@entity188 , who now lives in @entity265 with his wife , said it was important to make it public to colleagues and bosses that you 're in a serious relationship with another colleague because ' it ’ll tear up those office rumours '			1
‘ a lot of people think it 's a bad situation or it ’s not going down well if they tell people but often what we picture in our minds would be different in reality , ' @entity188 said			2
' and in most cases , it ’s actually not bad at all and you 'd be surprised with the positive reaction			0
