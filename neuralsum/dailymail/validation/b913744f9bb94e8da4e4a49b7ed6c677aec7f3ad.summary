@entity0 never served in the military			1
she was horribly disfigured , not in combat , but in a 2009 attack by a rampaging chimpanzee			1
the @entity5 , though , is watching her recovery closely			0
the @entity8 military paid for @entity10 's full face transplant in 2011 and is underwriting her follow - up treatment at a combined cost estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars , in the hope that some of the things it learns can help young , seriously disfigured soldiers returning from war			1
in the coming weeks @entity10 will take part in a military - funded experiment in which doctors at @entity23 's @entity22 will try to wean her off the anti-rejection drugs she has been taking since the transplant			1
but the 61 - year - old daughter of an @entity42 veteran said she gets real satisfaction out of letting the doctors use her for research , and sees it as an opportunity to help wounded soldiers and ' do something good out of all of this bad			1
' ' they asked me , could they ? i said , ` yeah , i 'd be thrilled to help out in any way i could , '' said @entity10 , a former @entity32 resident who now lives on her own in @entity23 with the help of part - time aides			1
@entity10 lost her nose , lips , eyelids and hands when she was mauled by her employer 's 200 - pound pet chimpanzee in @entity31 , @entity32			1
doctors also had to remove her eyes because of a disease transmitted by the chimp			0
she later received new facial features taken from a dead woman			0
she also underwent a double hand transplant , but it failed when her body rejected the tissue			2
now blind , @entity10 spends most of her days listening to am radio and books on tape - lately , ' @entity76 ' - in her modest , second - story apartment			1
military bosses hope that some of the things it learns from funding @entity10 's treatment will end up helping young , seriously disfigured soldiers returning from war @entity0 is set to take part in an experiment in which doctors will try to wean her off the anti-rejection drugs she has been taking since the transplant a care worker brushes @entity0 's teeth , which were provided by an organ donor along with her face , at her apartment in @entity23 @entity10 lost her nose , lips , eyelids and hands after she was attacked by her employer 's chimp @entity99 ( pictured ) in 2009 attack : @entity0 was mauled by @entity99 , pictured , as she tried to help the chimp 's owner catch the animal she also exercises a couple of days a week with a trainer at a gym to build her strength and stay healthy			1
a @entity110 account is being set up to help raise money for prosthetic hands			0
her life today is a stark contrast to her younger years , when she was a barrel racer on the rodeo circuit from the 1970s through the mid- 1990s			0
over the years , she also did some horse - jumping , worked on a farm and manned a computer help desk			0
she was working as a dispatcher for a towing company at the time of the attack			0
about every six weeks , @entity10 undergoes lab tests for the military at @entity22 and women 's			1
she is also subjected to mris and ct scans to determine how well her brain is sending signals to her new face			0
in addition , doctors examine how well the arteries are delivering blood to the transplant			0
the military is also interested in such things as any scarring around the mouth and how well her eyelids work			0
@entity0 grabs the arm of shuttle driver @entity144 as they walk from her apartment in @entity23 dr. @entity147 , the director of plastic surgery and @entity149 at the @entity22 , talks with @entity0 during an appointment about every six weeks , she undergoes lab tests for the military at the hospital			1
she also exercises a couple of days a week with a trainer at a gym to build her strength and stay healthy ' it makes sense for us to look at the civilian community and the experiences that are gained through the involvement of non-uniformed people to assess if this is a good solution for the military , ' said dr. @entity165 , a portfolio manager for the @entity167 and @entity168 research program			0
about 35 full or partial face transplants have been performed worldwide since the first one was done in @entity171 in 2005			2
the @entity5 estimates 560 soldiers have suffered severe facial wounds in @entity174 and @entity175			0
of those , about 50 or 60 might be candidates for a face transplant , @entity165 said			1
the @entity5 is providing grants to 14 medical facilities across the @entity8 through its hand and face transplantation program			1
the face and the extremities are the two most frequently injured parts of the body in war			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) drinks a cup of hot coffee through a straw while visiting a cafe in @entity23 medics insist @entity0 ( pictured ) is doing ' remarkably well ' and has experienced very few rejection episodes , making her a good candidate for the experiment now blind , @entity0 spends most of her days listening to am radio and books on tape - lately , ' @entity76 ' - in her modest , second - story apartment the new experiment , involving the suspension of anti-rejection drugs , will eventually include other patients , and its findings could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of people , military and civilian alike , doctors said			1
the immunosuppression drugs that transplant patients are typically given for the rest of their lives carry such risks as cancer , viral infections and kidney damage			2
because of those dangers , many transplants of non-vital body parts , such as thumbs , are not considered worth doing			0
but that could change if the drugs do n't have to be a lifelong commitment			0
' suddenly , it 's not as crazy to think about transplanting individual fingers or an ear , ' said dr. @entity147 , who led @entity10 's transplant surgery team			1
@entity10 will be switched to a different substance , @entity228 , which is normally used to treat skin and kidney cancers			2
the hope is that it will promote growth of good cells that protect the transplant while attacking those that want to reject it			2
@entity147 said @entity10 is doing ' remarkably well ' and has experienced very few rejection episodes , making her a good candidate for the experiment			2
' i think there 's an overarching purpose in her life			0
she really wants to help in whatever way she can , ' he said			0
' she 's very much a forward - looking woman			2
