by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:19 pm on 20th july 2011 under pressure : @entity3 leaves @entity4 on his way to address the @entity6 about phone hacking @entity9 's company was guilty of ‘ deliberately thwarting ’ the criminal investigation into the @entity11 , according to a hard - hitting report published today			1
the @entity14 study ‘ deplores ’ the behaviour of @entity16 and condemns the police for bungling their investigation and getting too close to the @entity9 empire			1
the report raises questions about the honesty of former news international chief executive @entity23 and @entity24 , who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the newspaper			1
the development came before @entity3 made an emergency statement on the scandal to the @entity31			1
he faced questions from mps about his party 's links to phone hacking suspect @entity36			2
the prime minister arrived home from a shortened trip to @entity41 last night as it was revealed that his communications chief @entity43 , had been advised by mr @entity36 in the run - up to the general election			2
in a further extraordinary development , @entity47 mp @entity46 today hinted that the @entity49 may have told mr @entity3 not to hire mr @entity43			1
mr @entity46 told the @entity50 : ' very senior people at @entity52 were very troubled by the appointment of @entity43 and tried to make it absolutely clear to the prime minister			1
' i am not sure whether this information ever got directly to the prime minister , but it certainly got to senior figures at @entity4			2
' @entity49 's grandchildren had their phones hacked			0
and quite probably other members of the @entity61 ... i think it would be perfectly natural for very senior members of the @entity64 to be very troubled about the appointment			2
' after all , @entity43 was the editor of the @entity11 when the royal princes ' phones were hacked			1
that is not in dispute			0
morning after the night before : @entity9 left his house today reading the front page of his paper @entity73 which covers his appearance at the @entity6 select committee ' and @entity43 resigned from the @entity11 expressly because of the hacking of the royal princes ' phones			1
' mr @entity46 did not name the queen directly			0
his claim prompted a furious denial from @entity4			0
a no 10 source said the allegation was ' scurrilous ' and ' complete rubbish '			0
culture secretary @entity84 leaves the @entity31 after @entity9 and his son @entity85 gave evidence			1
today he defended the prime minister 's handling of the scandal in his statement mr @entity3 will announce the names of the panel that will look at press regulation and the final terms of reference for the judge - led inquiry into claims about phone hacking and illegal payments to police			1
but , after the @entity103 , @entity23 and senior police officers were grilled in an extraordinary series of commons committee hearings , the prime minister will now be in the firing line			2
aides have indicated that he expects to be questioned by mps on the admission last night that @entity43 , @entity112 editor , was received help from @entity36 , former deputy editor at the same newspaper			2
both men have been arrested and bailed in connection with the @entity118 hacking inquiry			1
a senior cabinet minister defended mr @entity3 's handling of the @entity11 phone - hacking scandal today as the prime minister prepared to face a barrage of @entity109 ' questions over his role in the affair			1
culture secretary @entity84 denied that the continuing political firestorm represented the biggest crisis of mr @entity3 's premiership so far			1
but he acknowledged that the prime minister needed to demonstrate he was capable of the leadership needed to sort out the crisis which has rocked politicians , police and the media			0
he said mr @entity3 ' did n't have a crystal ball " but has made big decisions ' to sort this out '			2
he told @entity138 : ' what we 've seen is that he 's recalled @entity141 , he 's got an independent police inquiry , he 's got an independent judge - led inquiry , he 's published all the meetings he 's had with media owners and said in the future ministers will publish all the meetings that they have with media proprietors , so he 's done more in a couple of weeks than i think any other prime minister has done in a couple of decades and i think that is the key judgment call that the people of @entity158 will be looking for him to make			0
' mr @entity84 added the @entity103 ' committee hearing had shown that ' so much wrongdoing seemed to happen without the knowledge of the people at the top '			1
he told @entity164 's today programme : ' but it does seem like a huge amount was going wrong in that organisation and no one felt it necessary to tell the person at the top , and i think that was something that will have worried a lot of people			1
' the report raises issues about the honesty of former news international chief executive @entity23 , left			0
it also said the conduct of former assistant @entity180 commissioner @entity24 , right , during the investigation and ' during our evidence session was both unprofessional and inappropriate ’ @entity118 's current communications chief @entity185 , left , was also criticised for apparently showing ' no due diligence ' in conducting proper checks on @entity36 , right , the @entity112 deputy editor the @entity189 disclosed yesterday that former @entity11 deputy editor @entity36 had given informal advice to @entity43 when he was mr @entity3 's communications director in the run - up to the general election			1
the role of mr @entity36 - who was arrested last week by police investigating the phone - hacking allegations - was already under scrutiny after it was disclosed that he had been working for @entity118 as a part - time pr consultant			1
in a further twist , @entity4 released emails yesterday showing that mr @entity3 's chief of staff @entity201 had prevented senior police officers briefing mr @entity3 on the phone - hacking investigation			1
he wrote to assistant commissioner @entity205 telling him ' we will want to be able to be entirely clear , for your sake and ours , that we have not been in contact with you about this subject '			0
cabinet secretary sir @entity213 ruled last night that mr @entity201 had acted ' entirely properly ' but the disclosure is likely to increase the pressure on the prime minister			0
he is already facing demands to apologise for appointing mr @entity43 after he quit as @entity11 editor in 2007 after royal reporter @entity219 and private investigator @entity220 were jailed for hacking the phones of royal aides			1
the @entity14 said in its withering assessment today : ‘ we deplore the response of @entity16 to the original investigation into hacking			1
‘ it is almost impossible to escape the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal investigation			1
we are astounded at the length of time it has taken for @entity16 to co-operate with the police			0
’ the report points out that mrs @entity23 ’s denial of knowledge of phone hacking ‘ is limited to her time as editor of @entity11 ’ , a small part of her career in @entity16			0
holding hands , @entity9 and his wife @entity243 leave @entity141 after yesterday 's hearing and it also raises concerns about her knowledge of illegal payments to corrupt police officers			2
‘ she did not say that she had no knowledge of specific payments but that she had not intended to give the impression that she had knowledge of specific cases , ’ the @entity109 conclude			0
the committee condemns the police , singling out former assistant @entity180 commissioner mr @entity24 , criticising his handling of the case , his social contacts with @entity16 executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving the police			0
it said : ‘ mr @entity24 ’s conduct during the investigation and during our evidence session was both unprofessional and inappropriate			2
’ there was also criticism in the report for @entity185 , @entity118 's current communications chief , for apparently showing ' no due diligence ' in conducting proper checks on @entity36			2
mr @entity36 , an ex-news of the @entity280 executive , was employed by the @entity180 in 2009 and was last week questioned about phone hacking allegations			0
the committee said it was ' particularly shocked ' by mr @entity185 's approach to hiring @entity36 and said he tried to deflect blame on to mr @entity205			0
mps called for extra funding to support @entity287 , saying it would take years to inform all potential victims without it			0
they praised deputy assistant commissioner @entity292 ' decision to contact all potential victims of phone hacking by the @entity11			0
but they said they were ' alarmed ' that only 170 had have so far been informed , adding that ' up to 12,800 people may have been affected			0
' @entity3 chats to a mother about her twins during a visit yesterday to an immunisation clinic in @entity303 , @entity304			2
the prime minister cut short his visit to @entity41 so he could make a statement to the @entity31 today police officers will be jailed for accepting cash bribes from @entity11 journalists , mps were told yesterday			1
the newspaper is alleged to have paid tens of thousands of pounds to officers who supplied information			0
asked by mps on a parliamentary committee if any officers would go to prison , the outgoing assistant commissioner of the @entity180 , @entity205 , replied : ‘ if the corruption cases , which are very small in number , are properly investigated , i have no doubt			0
’ mr @entity205 resigned from the force on monday after he was told he faced suspension over his links to the newspaper .			0
