by @entity1 reporter published : 23:29 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 23:29 est , 14 august 2012 on the run : @entity5 ' @entity4 ' @entity3 has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last 11 years after escaping from a @entity9 prison in an effort to catch one of the world ’s most notorious drug kingpins , the @entity10 may use the same daring methods that took down @entity16			1
more than a year after the terror leader ’s demise in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity23 raid , the highly - trained commandos may be dispatched to @entity9 to kill or capture @entity5 ' @entity3			1
like the @entity24 , @entity3 has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a @entity9 high security prison in a complex breakout that reportedly cost him nearly $ 4million			2
@entity9 ’s @entity28 ( @entity30 translation ) reported that a new plan to get @entity3 was hatched by @entity9 president @entity32 , who felt the only way to catch him was through a military raid			1
but when @entity32 was turned down by @entity9 ’s army and naval forces , he turned to the @entity10 government , which has made catching or killing @entity3 a priority			2
sources told @entity28 that the @entity10 has grown increasingly more frustrated with @entity9 ’s failure to bring @entity3 to justice - especially after a joint effort by @entity10 agencies provided the information needed to catch him			1
@entity3 presides over a $ 1billion drug empire and is accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed nearly 50,000 people			2
the death of @entity16 pushed the notorious drug baron to the top of a list of international criminals compiled by international law enforcement officials and @entity56			0
brutality : @entity3 is wanted for allegedly firing the first shots in grisly drug cartel war which has gripped @entity9 for years and has claimed about 50,000 lives since then the drug lord known as ' @entity4 ' because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture , protected by his vast @entity65 drugs cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth			1
he has attained almost mythical status in @entity9 vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from @entity74 into @entity9 and on to the @entity10 but such a lucrative operation will always attract competition and @entity77 is arguably responsible for more deaths than @entity16 as his henchmen fight other cartels for control of lucrative transportation corridors into the @entity10 he is accused of starting @entity9 's cartel wars when his hitmen assassinated the leader of the @entity87 cartel and his wife in 2004 in a bid to take control of the city of @entity87 , breaking the pact of non-aggression that had previously existed			1
@entity94 : a member of @entity23 shot and killed @entity16 during the elite squad 's daring raid of his compound in @entity20 , @entity21 in the @entity99 : president @entity100 watched the @entity16 raid with vice president @entity102 and his closest advisers as tit - for - tat fighting escalated , government troops were sent into drug strongholds in 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has ravaged @entity9			1
@entity3 has been the number one drugs kingpin since the arrest of @entity111 , head of the @entity114 cartel in 2010			0
he first rose to prominence as the head of logistics for the @entity65 cartel @entity119 in the 1980s , coordinating flights boat shipments and truck journeys from @entity122 into @entity9			0
once his mentor was captured he took control of the entire cartel , before he himself was captured in 1993			0
gripped by violence : police tape surrounds the perimeter of the @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity9 , after a shooting inside but he escaped from prison in 2001 when a guard opened his cell door and wheeled him out of the maximum security @entity138 prison in a laundry basket			2
more than 70 people were arrested over the bold escape plan that may have involved local police , who allegedly gave him 24 hours to get away before the military moved in			0
he has evaded capture since , despite a series of narrow misses when the authorities were hours or minutes from catching him			0
law and order : government troops have been fighting drug violence in @entity9 , but @entity3 has never been re-captured one of the most chilling incidents was in 2009 , when an archbishop in the state of @entity158 said that the fugitive was ' living nearby and everyone knows it except the authorities , who just do n't happen to see him for some reason			0
' days later two undercover military officers were shot dead in their car , their bodies left with a note that read : ' you 'll never get ' @entity4 ' , not the priests , not the government			0
' now @entity4 is said to have infiltrated the highest level of @entity9 's government as president @entity32 fights to keep control of his country amid claims that it is drug lords such as @entity4 who are really in charge .			1

@entity5 ' @entity4 ' @entity3 is one of @entity9 's most wanted drug cartel kingpins
he escaped from prison in daring breakout in 2001
@entity9 president @entity32 reportedly reached out to @entity10 for help in taking out @entity3 in military raid
