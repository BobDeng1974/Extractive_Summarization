scientists have claimed they have produced a dvd that can hold 1,000 terabytes of data			1
that 's a whopping 212,000 times more than a regular dvd 's storage capacity of 4.7 gigabytes , meaning 40,000 hd movies could be stored on the new @entity7 format			1
the discs use lasers to write information down to a scale of just nine nanometres , allowing the high - storage discs to be made			2
scientists at @entity14 in @entity15 develop new dvd tech. their method uses two lasers to write data to the old disc format ( stock image shown )			1
previously dvds had been limited to @entity24 of data via laser writing , but using two beams of light this could be increased to an incredible 1,000 terabytes the dvd has become all but obsolete in recent years with the rise of the blu - ray format and cloud storage			1
but this new disc could herald a return for the discs , and they could provide a way to store huge amounts of data			2
previously dvds were limited due to what 's called the refraction limit of light			1
in just over 30 years , humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called the singularity - a futurist from @entity47 said last year			0
@entity48 , director of engineering at @entity47 , also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100			0
@entity54 made the claims during his conference speech at the @entity57 in @entity58 in june 2013			0
@entity48 said : ' based on conservative estimates of the amount of computation you need to functionally simulate a human brain , we 'll be able to expand the scope of our intelligence a billion-fold			0
' he referred to @entity68 that states the power of computing doubles , on average , every two years quoting the developments from genetic sequencing and 3d printing			0
it had been thought light could n't be made smaller than 500 nanometres , meaning dvds had reached capacity for how much information could be stored			2
but dr @entity81 and his team at @entity14 in @entity15 found that by using two lasers they could reduce this down to just nine nanometres			1
it 's likened to writing with a felt tip pen , the old method , and a fine - tipped pen , the new method			1
the innovative method involves using two beams of light to write data , both of which are 500 nanometres wide			1
however the second purple circular beam is used to block the first beam and leave just nine nanometres to strike the surface of the disc			0
this enables data to be written much more finely and greatly increases the storage capacity up to 1,000 terabytes			1
for comparison , one terabyte is equal to 1,000 gigabytes			0
' in my mind , i have an vision for our society in the future where everyone will have a data bank account just like we all have a bank account today , ' said creator dr. @entity81 according to @entity114			0
' we 'll save all of our data in the data bank			0
everyone no longer needs the same things today as phones , @entity120 or laptops			0
' we only need a soft touch screen , any data processing , while storage is done remotely			0
' the team has n't said when such a technology could become commercially available yet , and note a high cost in its development that could prove a problem			2
' putting so much information on a single disc makes it easier for people to destroy huge amounts of data and thus cost more to protect the disc , ' dr @entity81 continued			2
' also , we are now working to speed up for data reading and recording			0
if we 're still using the current @entity141 speed , how long will it take to write 1,000 terabytes of data onto a disc ? ' the new dvd format would have enough storage to hold 40,000 hd movies			1
there 's no news on when it might become commercially available yet though with the team noting cost and time problems need to be overcome			1
