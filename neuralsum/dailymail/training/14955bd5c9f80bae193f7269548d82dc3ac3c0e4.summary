having criticised @entity2 ’s players for taking a picture of themselves at @entity4 , i ’m supposed to have been left ‘ red - faced ’ by an image that emerged this week			1
it is of me , in a towel , standing alongside @entity8 and @entity9 , one of @entity11 ’s physiotherapists			0
it was taken in may 2013 at @entity13 , after my last away game , and @entity8 had scored his first hat - trick for @entity11			0
@entity8 was over the moon and he wanted his picture taken with a @entity11 legend ! so what more could i say ? i had no idea it was going to end up on social media			1
i did n’t have a clue what social media was back then ! @entity26 alongside @entity8 and physiotherapist @entity9 at @entity13 in may 2013 @entity27 shared this image on social media after @entity2 beat @entity4 2 - 0 at the @entity30 the @entity11 legend posted this picture on @entity32 of the @entity35 @entity34 team to try to say i am embarrassed now is utter nonsense — the same words i would use to express my distaste for this new fad			1
seriously , this trend has got to stop			0
@entity2 did it last week but it goes on at plenty of other clubs , too			0
i ’m all for players enjoying a win but should n’t the picture taking be saved for the games that matter , such as cup finals , when you can come away with proper memories ? ‘ @entity53 ’ should n’t be taken after you get three points : that , remember , is the job footballers are paid to do .			2

the trend of players taking ' *selfies* ' has got to stop
' @entity53 ' should *n't* be taken after every win , that *'s* what players are paid for
i *'m* not at all embarrassed or red - faced that a picture of me and @entity8 *appeared* on social media after i criticised @entity2
