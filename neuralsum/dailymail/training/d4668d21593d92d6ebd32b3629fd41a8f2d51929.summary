@entity0 and @entity1 are inspiring awe with freakish regularity			1
for the @entity5 , it is rocket shots from all angles			0
for the @entity9 , it is his uncanny knack of scoring at just the right time			0
on wednesday night , each delivered again			0
@entity0 took his @entity14 tally to 14 goals with a double of sheer beauty at @entity18 ; @entity1 reached nine with a late finish to claim victory over stubborn @entity21			1
both have @entity24 flair in spades , but it is each player ’s steely resolve to win games for their team which is most impressive			0
both @entity0 and @entity1 ( right ) have been key for their teams this season @entity0 has scored 45 per cent of @entity31 ’s goals in the @entity14 this season			1
@entity1 ’s strikes account for 41 per cent of @entity35 ’s total			2
each forward has directly won nine points through their contributions so far ( goals and assists ) – and are single - handedly raising their clubs up the division , as these tables show			1
city slump six places to eighth with @entity0 out of the equation			2
erase him from @entity53 ’s selections and there would be no four - goal demolition of @entity56 translating a defeat to victory , no winner against @entity48 , no rescue mission at @entity50			2
@entity35 plummet even further minus @entity1 – eight places to 14th			2
as much as his tenacity and technique are a joy to behold , his empirical importance is what @entity64 will value			0
he has salvaged draws from defeats against @entity67 , @entity31 , and @entity68 – won the game at @entity18 and set his side on the path to late victory over @entity73			1
@entity0 scored twice for @entity31 against @entity18 on wednesday night @entity0 ’s qualities are well - established – it is more than two years since @entity76 won the title for @entity31 – but his level right now , at 26 , is approaching the heights climbed only by the best this country has seen			1
for impact and ingenuity , he is matching the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
@entity1 has taken to @entity88 football with an ease that is not necessarily guaranteed by a large transfer cheque			2
aged 25 , he is still on an upward curve , making his £ 30million fee last summer appear ever more a bargain as each defining goal hits the back of the net			0
even after only 14 @entity14 games , it is clear the final finishing positions of @entity31 and @entity35 will be determined by the form and fitness of two men measuring 5ft 8in and 5ft 7in			1
size does n’t matter , goals do			0
@entity1 scores @entity35 's winner against @entity21 at the end to secure all three points @entity1 celebrates as he netted his ninth goal of the season @entity110 has scored 11 goals for @entity112 since joining from @entity113 in the summer @entity115 , on 11 goals , separates @entity0 and @entity1 in second at the top of the scoring charts			1
he has stormed into this league but is not as individually important as the other two			0
without his goals and assists @entity112 would still be first , such is their supremacy and spread of contributors			1
five points fewer , but still no 1 .			0

@entity0 has scored 14 goals for @entity31 this season
@entity1 and @entity0 have won nine points for their sides this year
@entity112 do not depend on @entity110 - despite his 11 goals this season
