reindeer meat may be considered a delicacy in some countries , but 30,000 years ago our @entity4 ancestors preferred eating mammoths			1
cuts of reindeer were instead saved for their canine companions , according to research at @entity11 , a prehistoric site in the @entity12			1
the @entity14 people used the bones of more than 1,000 mammoths to build their settlement , as well as creating incredible ivory sculptures			2
artist 's impression of a mammoth pictured but researchers at the @entity21 wanted to know whether the @entity14 culture harvested the bones from already dead mammoths , or if they hunted them for food			2
scientists carried out an analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in human and animal fossil bones from the site			1
they then tested to see whether the @entity14 people ate mammoth meat by examining the bones alongside bones from dogs at the site			1
reindeer meat may be considered a delicacy in some countries , but 30,000 years ago our @entity4 ancestors preferred eating mammoths			2
cuts of reindeer were instead saved for their canine companions , according to research at @entity11 , a prehistoric site in the @entity12 pictured is a @entity53 figure holding horn or cornucopia gravettian culture flourished 31,000 – 22,000 years ago in the @entity4 upper paleolithic era			1
the phase was characterised by a stone - tool industry with small pointed blades used for big - game hunting , such as bison , horse , reindeer and mammoth			0
it is divided into two regional groups : the western @entity14 , mostly known from cave sites in @entity69 , and the eastern @entity14 , with sites for mammoth hunters on the plains of central @entity4 and @entity73			2
the culture appeared at a time when @entity76 were being displaced by modern humans , who had entered @entity4 from @entity78 and the @entity79 some 15,000 years before			0
during this process , @entity76 retreated to the southern half of the @entity82			0
the @entity14 people are famous for the many @entity84 figurines they created , which are widely distributed in @entity4			0
another famous prehistoric discovery of this period are the hand stencils in @entity88 close to @entity89			0
they discovered that the culture probably left behind large amounts of mammoth carcasses as shown by the finding that brown bears , wolves and wolverines also ate mammoths			1
surprisingly , dogs in the settlement did not show a high level of mammoth consumption , but rather consumed reindeer meat			1
scientists believe reindeers were hunted by the @entity14 people for their antlers to make tools , and their meat was also a small part of their diet			1
the culture appeared at a time when @entity76 were being displaced by modern humans , who had entered @entity4 from @entity78 and the @entity79 some 15,000 years before			0
the study confirms that mammoths were a key component of the prehistoric diet in @entity4 30,000 years ago , and that dogs were already being looked after by humans			1
separate research has found that the sudden appearance of dwellings built from mammoth bones was due to humans hunting alongside the earliest domesticated dogs			2
in may , @entity126 of @entity127 took a fresh look at @entity4 archaeological sites built with mammoth bones			0
' one of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time , ' she said			0
professor @entity126 used information about how humans hunt with dogs to formulate a series of testable predictions about these mammoth sites			2
' dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in			0
both of these effects would increase hunting success , ' she said			0
' large dogs like those identified by @entity156 either can help carry the prey home or , by guarding the carcass from other carnivores , can make it possible for the hunters to camp at the kill sites			0
' the study confirms that mammoths were a key component of the prehistoric diet in @entity4 30,000 years ago , and that dogs were already being looked after by humans ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity170 is a prehistoric site of the @entity14 people located near @entity173 in the @entity12			1

fossils were *uncovered* at prehistoric @entity11 site in @entity12
scientists studied nitrogen stable isotopes in human and animal fossils
they found the culture left behind huge amounts of mammoth carcasses
dogs ate reindeer meat , probably *discarded* by their @entity14 owners
the study shows how dogs were already being looked after by humans
it also confirms *importance* of mammoth in the prehistoric human diet
