the invite read ' @entity1 ' and the @entity3 show stayed true to its word running fashionably late			1
however fans were prepared to wait as the accessories designer 's show is easily one of the hottest tickets at @entity10			2
with her previous catwalks transformed into fairgrounds complete with spinning teacups and supermarkets with working conveyor belts , guests can always expect a good show			0
@entity3 transformed the runway into a motorway complete with road workers for her @entity23 line model @entity24 dons traffic cone colours with a matching bag at the @entity3 show today famous for making the mundane desirable @entity30 's line of handbags were emblazoned with road signs and on the final day of @entity10 , @entity33 - who is one of the duchess of @entity37 's favourite bag designers - performed her usual magic of turning mundane everyday items into desirable accessories that often attract a long waiting list			1
for her autumn / winter 2015 line entitled @entity30 was influenced by @entity44 's motorways , with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by @entity49 speed limits			1
the @entity50 dressed in road worker uniforms brought the brightly coloured , high - visibility - themed show to a tuneful crescendo			2
as usual the show attracted quirkier characters to the front row including artist @entity57 , dressed in his finest drag , as well as @entity60 drummer @entity59			0
the no u-turn sign appeared several times across her line of leather accessories the famous @entity67 bag that has proven popular in previous seasons received a high - vis makeover continuing the motorway theme , the @entity67 even saw the service station @entity73 logo make an appearance motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection , with bags stamped with traffic signs such as ' road works ahead ' and ' no u-turn			1
' the motorway theme was continued with the covetable @entity67 design which has been a sell - out after last year 's autumn / winter 2014 collection , in which the designer covered the bags in @entity90 packet designs			1
this season however , the leather tote was emblazoned with iconic images of the @entity95 service station			2
even the designer 's iconic chandelier tassels took on a practical makeover transformed into traffic cones in bright orange and white			2
this season sees @entity33 introduce clothing to the brand , but her signature bags were the star of the show , branded with signs including ( left to right ) a fire exit sign , a ' stop ' sign and the ' no u-turn ' insignia clothing items include bomber jackets and shearling coats complete with road sign logos , while bags were decorated with traffic cone purses and ' no mobile phone ' clutches certain items from the new line including the @entity67 and @entity123 clutch ( pictured ) are available to pre-order online for a limited time only perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the @entity123 clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars			1
speaking to @entity131 about her new collection @entity33 says she dreamed up the bright orange designs during her commute			2
‘ basically i spend way too much time on the @entity136 ! i had this idea to look at the beauty in the everyday , capturing that slightly trance - like feeling you get when you ’re in you car on the motorway and you ’ve got a clear road in front of you with your favourite bit of music on			1
' and this collection is about how you feel in that moment , as well as all of the beautiful imagery of that signage going on around you			0
' aside from the roadside chic @entity33 paid homage to her favourite foodie fashions with other miniature bags including recreations of @entity156 , @entity158 and @entity159 packets			0
a grey clutch was printed with a ' park and ride ' sign - a familiar sight in most @entity44 towns , if not the catwalk ; a military green bag was turned into a portable ' go ' sign with a striped handle @entity33 also included some of her food based accessories which have previously been a big hit an @entity174 fur jacket also made an appearance on the runway paired with a @entity178 sweater the @entity180 bag is the collection 's most expensive piece at £ 2,695 as well as her usual miniatures @entity33 made space for roomier bags in the line featuring several leather backpacks dotted with brightly coloured logos			2
contrary to previous seasons the @entity23 catwalk saw the debut of the brand 's first range of clothing having previously only selling handbags and silk scarves			1
items in the collection include @entity174 bomber jackets and high visibility tabards recreated as fur gilets			0
certain items from the logo - heavy collection are currently available to pre-order online for a limited time following their appearance on the catwalk			0
@entity33 says that the inspiration for the collection came from sitting in traffic on the @entity136 the @entity44 designer wanted to capture the trance you fall into while driving with your favourite song on @entity33 also incorporated her signature tassels and snake skin design into her road work creations however , those eager for an @entity67 should start saving now as prices begin at £ 125 for a sticker and rocket to £ 2,695 for an @entity224 leather bag			1
the @entity44 designer 's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in @entity228 , @entity229			0
noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular , she borrowed £ 600 to import some to @entity231 and quickly sold 500 , with a little help from @entity234 & @entity235 magazine			0
a year later she had opened her first shop in @entity237			0
fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and the late @entity245 as fans			0
and with people flocking to her site already to secure a must - have accessory it looks like @entity33 could remain queen of the it - bag for another season			0
@entity33 's presentations tend to attract quirkier characters such as the artist @entity57 ( left ) and @entity60 drummer @entity59 ( right ) who both made an appearance today @entity3 ( left ) with fashion editor @entity258 at this morning 's show			1
