by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 have opened their first retail store for the row - which includes a pool in its courtyard			1
the new outpost , which opened tuesday in @entity9 , is housed in a stark white mid-century building whose central , outdoor area comes equipped with a recessed pool for swimming			1
not ones to hold their customers back , the sisters have placed a leather basket of plush towels beside it for those who wish to take a dip mid-shopping			0
even the newly - engaged @entity1 is prone to get in on the action			0
‘ it ’s really tempting ’ she told @entity22 of the store ’s best amenity and visual focal point			1
@entity36 said of the location , once a @entity53 salon : ‘ it was a toss - up between @entity55 and @entity9 , and when this space became available , we jumped on it			1
‘ it used to be a hair salon and my sister and i used to come here , so we were very aware of the space			0
’ the store is divided into three areas they have called ‘ galleries ’ , which have been laid out to look like a home – with spaces representing a dining room , library , and living room			2
‘ ultimately , for us , it was about setting it up like a home and just having the apparel be a part of the space , ’ @entity36 explained of how the store has been organized			2
in keeping with this theme , the sisters worked with vintage furniture dealers to outfit the store with prized design pieces by @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 – all of which are also for sale			1
racks of the label 's elegant clothes - which are revered for their simplicity and craftsmanship - hang among the valuable mid-century furniture , making the store feel like an incredibly well - designed closet			1
comfy environs : the store has been organized to resemble a home , with its three ' galleries ' designed to appear as a living room , dining room , and library more than clothes : the sisters worked with antique furniture dealers to track down precious designs that are also for sale in the store an assortment of the sisters ’ favorite @entity113 styles is available for individual purchase as well , and are scattered throughout the boutique			1
the @entity116 say that having their own store has always been a part of their big plan			2
in opening the boutique , they not only get to articulate the environment in which their clothes are sold – but they also have the opportunity to market pieces that have not been picked up by department stores			1
while @entity126 retails in 188 stores across 37 countries , @entity1 says that only 20per cent of their seasonal collections are purchased by wholesale vendors			0
the row ’s @entity9 boutique , however , will sell their made - in - @entity136 collections in their entirety			1
but this singular store is only the start			2
while the sisters believe that opening their first location in @entity55 was too ‘ aggressive ’ an option , they do hope to set up shop there sometime in the near future			0
they also plan to implement the lessons they learn with this store into a grander retail scheme for their lower - priced , more commercial line @entity153			2
craftsmanship : the row 's made - in - @entity136 designs are revered for their simplicity and superb quality according to the @entity116 , the @entity5 ’s first store is just a tipping off point for what will follow in the near future			1
as @entity1 explained : ‘ we will get into shoes in the next year			0
to us it ’s really about a lifestyle , and i think this store is a great starting - off point to express where we are going			0
’ the row was established in 2006 , initially as a line of knitwear , t - shirt , and denim basics			0
the label has since exponentially expanded to include fur and handbags and is carried at stores including @entity179 and @entity180			0
as a luxury label , prices for the line range from $ 225 for a tank top up to $ 5,000 and beyond for coats			0
items typically retail between $ 1,200 to $ 2,500			0
more on the way : @entity1 and @entity36 say that this store is just the beginning and that they plan to open more in the future , as well as start their own line of shoes and perhaps branch out into menswear in 2012 , the label won the @entity195 for @entity196 – beating out fellow contenders @entity198 and @entity199			1
@entity1 and @entity36 also manage a contemporary label @entity153 , and a lower - priced line called @entity202 which sells at @entity203 .			0

the row 's first boutique opened in @entity9 this week
the store will sell the label 's entire collection , as well as rare furniture pieces and @entity113 shoes
