by @entity0 last updated at 12:45 pm on 12th december 2011 a team of historians believe they have unearthed evidence of a 4,000 - year - old @entity5 camp - thanks to a dog walker			1
@entity7 was walking his pet at @entity9 in @entity10 , when he discovered a handful of strange - shaped rocks			2
experts later identified the rocks as flint ' flakes ' , which are the off - cuts from tools crafted by @entity17 4,000 years ago			1
discovery : the @entity5 flints were found in @entity9 , which is also the location of the @entity21 , pictured , dating from around 2,500 year ago if the discovery is confirmed , it could mark the spot of the only @entity26 camp known in the @entity27			1
@entity28 , a member of the @entity29 , is convinced the camp could identify a link from the time when mankind changed from nomadic hunter - gatherer to village dweller			2
mr @entity28 is now calling for a full excavation of the site after contacting the @entity39 archaeologist			1
excited : archaeologist @entity28 said the discovery could be one of the most important for decades and now wants the site to be fully excavated he said : ' this could be the most significant historical find for decades			1
there have been previous individual finds from the stone age - tools , weapons and burial sites - but never a settlement			1
' i really have n't a clue what they would find if they began a full excavation			1
' i 've studied the area time and again			0
there 's a sandstone cliff and i wonder if the people of that time built their settlement against it for shelter			0
' from there they would have had an amazing view , all the way to the @entity71			0
' he added : ' it would not have been a big community , a couple of families at most living in thatched dwellings surrounded by a wooden blockade			0
the slivers of stone handed by mr @entity7 to mr @entity28 provide an insight into the @entity26 period , known as the @entity26 - a part of our history of which little is known			0
the @entity9 tribe had access to flint - in an area where the stone is not native			2
@entity28 mr @entity28 explained : ' they either discovered flat pebbles of it in the @entity95 , or it was imported from down south			0
' the discovery is just the latest archaeological treasure unearthed in @entity9 , where pagans still flock to celebrate the summer solstice at @entity21 , an @entity101 fort , dating from around 2,500 years ago , thought to possess mystical powers			0
in 1907 , two @entity104 archaeologists discovered a @entity26 ' flint ' factory on nearby farming land			1
the haul included 600 flint blades and 40 complete ' implements '			2
mr @entity28 is convinced there are more treasures to be found in the @entity9 area			0
he added : ' the area really is a magical spot and each discovery shows @entity26 man was a lot cleverer than we first thought			0

finds flint ' flakes ' which could be from @entity5 tools
archaeologists call for full excavation of the site
