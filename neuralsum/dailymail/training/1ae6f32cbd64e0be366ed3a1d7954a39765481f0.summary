by @entity0 and mail online reporter the suburban @entity3 homeowner who shot dead an unarmed 19 - year - old black woman who knocked on his door last fall said he is haunted by his actions as he took the stand today in his second - degree murder trial			1
@entity10 , 55 , told the jury monday that he feared multiple people were trying to break into his house when teen @entity14 banged on his door in the early hours of november 2 , after she drunkenly got into a car accident			1
he added that he did n't know whether his shotgun was loaded when he opened the door and fired at @entity14 's head			1
' it 's devastating , ' a tearful wafer told the jury			0
' she had her life in front of her			0
i took that from her			0
' i was n't going to cower in my house , ' @entity10 said			1
wafer is charged with second - degree murder and manslaughter and could be sentenced to up to life in prison with the chance for parole , if he 's convicted			1
he says he shot @entity14 in self - defense , but prosecutors argue that @entity10 could have stayed safely behind his locked doors and called 911 instead of confronting @entity14 , whom he did n't know			1
softly and methodically , @entity10 told the @entity50 @entity49 jury how he followed loud bangs from his front door to his side door and back to the front again before fetching his 12 - gauge shotgun			1
he said he opened the front door slightly and saw that the outer , screen door was damaged			0
he then opened the inner door further and ' this person came out from the side of my house so fast			0
i raised the gun and shot , ' he told jurors after taking the stand on the seventh day of testimony			0
@entity10 also said he thought there could have been more than one person outside of his 1,100 - square - foot home near @entity3 's far west side			2
he said he pulled the trigger ' to defend myself			2
it was them or me			0
' when police arrived , @entity14 lay in a pool of blood just off the porch			2
self defense ? @entity10 told the jury that when he opened his screen door , he saw that it had been torn and thought someone was trying to break in			2
that 's when he pulled the trigger no @entity14			1

in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , civil rights activists questioned whether race may have been a factor			0
wafer is white and @entity14 was black , and some likened the killing to that of @entity95 teenager @entity94			2
but race faded as an issue and was n't mentioned as a factor by prosecutors or defense attorneys during court hearings that preceded the trial			0
earlier in the trial , prosecutors played a recording of @entity10 telling an officer that he did n't know the gun was loaded			1
they contend that @entity10 did n't need to use deadly force against @entity108 autopsy found @entity14 's blood - alcohol level was about 0.22 , which is nearly three times @entity110 's legal limit for driving			1
about 3Â½ hours before @entity10 killed her , @entity14 crashed her car into a parked vehicle on a @entity3 street about half a mile away			1
to acquit @entity10 , the jury would have to find that he shot @entity14 because he had a reasonable and honest fear for his life			1
emotional : @entity10 struggled to hold back tears when he took the stand on monday , describing the events that led up to @entity14 's death occasionally rubbing the right side of his head and speaking with his eyes closed , @entity10 testified that he bought the shotgun about six years ago			1
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity125 , asked if he had a security system installed at his home			2
he said no. ' i think everybody would like to have a security system in their house , ' he said			0
' i could n't afford it			0
' the neighborhood had changed greatly since he bought the house in 1994 , added @entity10 , who appeared monday to be fixated on his personal safety			2
' my front door and screen door are usually always locked , ' said @entity10 , adding that the same goes for his back door			2
he said he uses the side door most often to get in and out and that the screen door on the side of his house is usually not locked			0
profound loss : @entity146 reacts to photos of his deceased daughter during @entity10 's trial on thursday , july 24 earlier monday , a firearms expert testified for the defense that @entity10 and @entity14 were both apparently standing close to his screen door when he shot her through it , killing her			1
retired state trooper @entity154 said the hole in the door made by the shotgun blast shows it was near the door when he fired it			0
he said the buckshot wounds on @entity14 's body show she was standing near the door when @entity10 shot her last fall			1
' my opinion is she was very close to the door ... within a foot , ' @entity154 told the jury			0
it is not clear how or why she showed up on @entity10 's porch			0
they did n't know each other			0
dr. @entity172 , a former medical examiner , testified last week that a laceration on @entity14 's hand shows she may have injured it while pounding on @entity10 's door			1
but the doctor who performed the autopsy found nothing remarkable about her hand .			0
