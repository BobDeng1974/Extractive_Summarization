many football love stories start with a game shared with @entity2			0
i never had this , but i ’d heard the stories and was hoping for that father - son experience when i took my eldest son @entity7 to @entity8 on sunday			1
he ’s 10 and a @entity11 fan like his dad			1
not like his brother @entity13 who is seven and declared recently that he ’s changing teams to support @entity15			2
on my mind was the @entity18 incident			0
not that i was worried about the real @entity11 fans but more so those idiots who put on the shirt claiming to be @entity11 fans without caring what image or message they send out , and are just out to cause trouble			1
@entity11 supporters pose with @entity27 ( centre ) and his eldest son , @entity7 ( second right ) at @entity8 @entity11 fans cheer on their team in the @entity31 - and @entity27 was one of the supporters at @entity8 @entity11 celebrate winning the @entity33 at @entity8 in 1998 , @entity27 's first trophy as a professional i did n’t know what to expect			1
i was n’t 100 per cent confident but we went by public transport on the @entity39 to @entity40 because we wanted to walk down @entity41			0
a cup final would n’t be the same without it			0
it was great to see @entity7 ’s excited face counting down the stops as we neared the stadium			0
as soon as we stepped out of the station we saw waves of people in blue and white			0
what a great feeling it was walking down @entity41 with my son			2
as a player you do n’t get to experience this			0
i was loving it as much as him			0
the different races in blue shirts walking towards the stadium was clear to see			0
it was nothing like the image those racist idiots painted of @entity11 fans on the @entity18			1
' as a player you do n’t get to experience the walk down @entity41			0
i loved it as much as my son ' , said @entity27 ' it was a great feeling it was walking down @entity41 with my son among different races in blue shirts ' the scenes on @entity41 vastly contrasted with the behaviour of some fans on the @entity18 last month @entity11 have a more cosmopolitan set of fans than when i was playing			1
you have fans from all nationalities and not only @entity82 descent			2
the club must be happy with the progress and that @entity86 incident must have felt like a painful kick in the short - and - curlies			2
after stopping to grab pizza , we went inside and when you see the pitch and the stadium , you ca n’t help but wish you were out there			0
i played my one and only @entity8 cup final in march 1998 in this same competition , but known then as the @entity33			1
we beat @entity98 2 - 0 and it was my first trophy as a professional			2
the @entity11 supporters at @entity8 were a mixed set of fans from different races , families and groups ' when @entity107 scored the first @entity11 goal i enjoyed a brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating ' as we took our seats , i gave him a history lesson about the day i played in this final 17 years ago			1
around us again were a mixed set of @entity11 fans from different races , families , groups of lads and father and sons			1
after a while a few asked for pictures with me and also offered some kind words to me about my time at the club , dads explaining to their kids i used to play for @entity11 and making me feel old			1
flag waving and singing songs with @entity7 and the other @entity11 fans was great			1
i just had to make sure he missed out certain words to a few songs and it was fine			2
when @entity107 scored the first @entity11 goal it was brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating was priceless , then to see the other fans celebrating with him was great			1
and just when i thought the smile on his face could n’t get any bigger his favourite player , @entity137 scored the second			0
' @entity137 ( right ) , my son 's favourite player , scored the second goal to seal victory for @entity11 ' @entity137 's deflected effort beat @entity146 to make it 2 - 0 to @entity11 in the @entity31 when the final whistle went , we were high - fiving and hugging strangers and watching @entity107 lift the trophy which brought back memories for myself of @entity152 letting @entity153 lift the trophy in 1998			1
we went home on the tube amongst lots of @entity159 fans , disappointed but singing very loudly			2
@entity7 kept laughing every time he heard a rude word			0
it was the only part of the day when i felt uncomfortable			0
it was a shame to hear more stories about alleged racism on a train later in the night			1
' watching @entity107 lift the trophy with his team - mates brought back memories of my @entity33 win ' @entity137 and @entity107 pose with the @entity31 trophy on the @entity8 pitch after the 2 - 0 victory the sooner a strong radical punishment for such behaviour is put in place the better it is for all			1
thankfully we saw nothing like it			0
i had enjoyed the day as a black father and a @entity11 fan watching his team win at @entity8			1
the only colour that mattered was the same one wrapped around the cup … …			0
' the only colour that mattered was the one of the ribbons on the trophy , and they were @entity11 blue '			2

i took my son to @entity8 to support @entity11 in the @entity31
@entity11 's support on the day was *multicultural* and *welcoming*
my only *concern* were the rude words that my 10 - year - old son could hear
but news of more alleged racism by fans on a train was disappointing
i enjoyed the day as a black father and a @entity11 fan watching his team win
