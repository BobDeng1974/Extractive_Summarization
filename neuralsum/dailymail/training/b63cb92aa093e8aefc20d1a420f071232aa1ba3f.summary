in february 2011 , they fell pregnant with @entity19 , but soon they were faced with the difficult decision of whether to abort the baby , following mrs @entity7 ' diagnosis			1
' i wanted the baby so bad			0
it was just a miracle she came to us , ' she said			0
' no , she was not going anywhere			0
' so the chemotherapy began			2
' @entity19 went through the chemo too , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
' she was my strength			0
' two months after the birth , mrs @entity7 had a double mastectomy and underwent radiation before beginning a breast reconstruction			1

' just being with my kids is the happiest i 've ever been in my life , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
she recovered and thankfully her breast cancer did n't return			1

behind her , against the wall , was a towering glass and wood cabinet			2
' she did n't want to be in a high chair , ' her father said			0
' she wanted to be in a regular chair like her sister			0
' just as they began painting , @entity38 told her mom the family 's labrador retriever was soaking wet outside so mrs @entity7 slipped out the back door for ' not even a minute and a half ' to towel her off			1
with the back door shut , she heard nothing unusual			0
but as soon as she came back inside , @entity19 was crying and walking toward her with blood gushing from her head			2
later , @entity38 , the only witness , told sheriff â€™s investigators @entity19 put her feet up and pushed against on the table , shoving the chair back into the cabinet			2

' oh my @entity109 ! ' she screamed			0
' my baby - i was outside real quick turning off the hose - apparently she fell back and hit the glass			2
she is bleeding out ! ' later in the three minute call , she added to the dispatcher : ' her head and her ear are cut in half			2

because of the severe head laceration , the parents were n't able to pick her up			0
' she was so beautiful , laying there , ' mr @entity32 said			0
' while they were saying goodbye , the paramedics returned to the family home and cleaned it until it was spotless			0
this is n't in their job description , but the squad did n't want the already distraught family to have to clean @entity19 's blood off the floor when they arrived home			2
' nobody should have to go through a tragedy like this , ' @entity151 fire battalion chief @entity150 said			0

' she had a story , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
' she was an angel to us and now ... she 's our guardian angel again			0
we just want her back with us again			0
' she added : ' it 's been hard because you do question - after everything we 've been through - your faith			0
