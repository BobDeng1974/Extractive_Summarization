by @entity0 and @entity1 sudden : @entity2 passed away while she was studying to be a nurse after taking out a $ 100,000 student loan donations are pouring in for a @entity7 couple who were saddled with $ 200,000 of their daughter 's student loan debts when she died suddenly of liver failure			1
a gofundme page has already raised nearly $ 11,000 in less than two days - including one anonymous donation of $ 5,000			1
pastor @entity13 , 59 , and his wife @entity14 are trying to raise their daughter @entity15 's three children while paying $ 2,000 a month for loans she took out to attend nursing school			1
@entity15 tragically died last year of liver failure at the age of 27			1
@entity15 children , which @entity23 and mrs @entity2 are now caring for , are age nine , 12 and 14			2
' we 've been totally blown away			0
it 's so encouraging to realize there 's a lot of good people out there , ' pastor @entity13 told @entity33			1
it also appears that the loan companies that had refused to negotiate with pastor @entity13 have now been shamed into leniency			2
@entity37 , which had been insisting mr @entity13 pay $ 35,000 has lowered the principle to $ 27,000 and dropped interest rates to zero percent on three of the four loans			2
another debt collection firm has said it plans to forgive the entire $ 15,000 loan debt after it was contacted by @entity33			0
in the five years since her tragic passing , the @entity55 ' inability to keep up with the payments has seen the sum owed double to $ 200,000 because of the high interest rates and late - fee penalties			0
previously , each time @entity62 had appealed to the lenders to beg for help , the couple have been told that the only solution is to repay the mammoth loans - some of which have interest rates of 12 percent - in full			0
compounding the desperation , @entity13 makes less than $ 75,000 a year at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity7 and @entity14 earns less in her role as director at the same church			1
even if pastor @entity13 declared bankruptcy , the student loan debt could never be forgiven			2
he will either pay it off , or take it to the grave			0
' it 's just impossible on a pastor 's salary raising three kids to pay $ 2,000 a month on loans , ' said @entity13 to @entity33 , claiming that he is now searching for a second job			1
the answer to why @entity13 is in such dire financial straits is because these are private student loans			0
@entity92 and daughter : @entity2 with her mother , @entity14 , before her tragic and sudden death from liver failure in 2009 had they been federal student loans , then @entity13 could have appealed to have them wiped or at the very least received a sensible and manageable payment plan			1
however , because these are private loans he has nowhere to turn legally			0
private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty , according to @entity33 , not even when a family member has passed away .			0

@entity7 pastor @entity13 and his wife @entity14 are *facing* financial ruin
daughter , @entity15 , 27 , passed away suddenly from liver failure in 2009
left parents with her three children and bills of $ 2,000 a month
@entity118 has raised nearly $ 11,000 in less than two days
