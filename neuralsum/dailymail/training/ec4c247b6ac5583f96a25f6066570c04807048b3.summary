sisters @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity10 looms all have a rare genetic disease which means they are losing their sight			1
it means @entity7 , 25 , will no longer be able to watch her four children grow up , @entity9 24 , wo n’t be able to see her two children , and if @entity10 , 22 , has a baby she may never see it , as the three sisters are all going blind			1

@entity7 , who has daughters @entity29 , eight , @entity30 , five , @entity40 - may , two , and newborn @entity41 , said : ‘ at the moment there is no cure for our condition			1
' we know that one day all three of us will be blind and we make the most of each day with our children and family whilst we can			1
‘ we just all wish that we could have our sight back , but we know that is not going to happen			2
we wo n’t be able to see our children grow up , so we cherish every moment with them			2
’ sisters : @entity10 , @entity7 and @entity9 are intent on making the most of their sight which is deteriorating because of a rare genetic disease brave : although @entity9 , pictured here with her two children @entity33 and @entity35 , is losing her sight more slowly than her sisters she is still facing the prospect of going blind @entity7 , who lives with partner @entity65 , in @entity66 , @entity67 , was the first to be diagnosed with the condition @entity69 in december 2008 , when she was pregnant with her third daughter			1
she said : ‘ i started having spots in front of my eyes and had bad headaches			2
at first i thought it was due to my pregnancy , so i was n’t worried at first , but mum insisted that i get it checked out			2
‘ when i was tested at the hospital they told be that i had this disease			2
they told me that i could lose my sight and i was absolutely devastated			0
all i could think of was how i was going to look after my children			0
‘ i had another baby on the way too - would i ever see them grow up			0
’ @entity69 is a hereditary eye condition which affects the central area of the retina called the macula			1
there is no cure for it			0
doctors then tested her two sisters @entity9 and @entity98 for it			1
the girls also have a sister @entity101 , 29 , and brothers @entity102 and @entity104 , but they have a different father so they did n’t need to be tested			0
two weeks later the three sisters were given the shattering news that they all had the condition			1
they were going blind too			1
@entity109 said : ‘ it was devastating			0
we just hugged each other and could n’t stop crying			0
we were devastated that we may not see our children grow up or get married			0
’ @entity7 and @entity10 are both now partially sighted			1
they ca n’t drive anymore , and daughter @entity30 has become @entity7 ’s eyes			1
tragic : @entity7 with her four children , who she says have already had to learn to act as her eyes because of her sight is rapidly deteriorating devastated : the girl 's sister @entity120 , who does n't suffer from the disease , says she wishes she could take on the condition to ease their suffering @entity7 said : ‘ i ca n’t see the television anymore , or read text messages on my phone , and when i take @entity30 to school , she has to watch out and tell me if there are any steps infront of me			1
' she has become my eyes for me , she watches out for me and makes sure i do n’t bump into anything or fall			0
’ @entity9 ’s sight is better than her sisters , although hers has started to deteriorate too			1
they all wear special lenses to try and slow down the deterioration and are taking care of their health			0
their elder sister @entity101 , a mother of three , said : ‘ it is heartbreaking that all my sisters have this awful disease			2
‘ if i could have just one wish , it would be that they could all have their sight back			0
i wish i could have it for them			0
not being able to do anything to help them is heartbreaking			0
' the sisters are making the most of the time that they have left with their sight , and are enjoying family holidays and days out			2
@entity7 added : ‘ we want to create as many wonderful memories that we can , so we are doing as many things as a family all together that we can			1
‘ we do n’t want to ever forget what our children look like , so we are taking as many photographs as we can too			0
