by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 insists @entity3 could not have failed a medical at @entity5 and says there must be another reason for his transfer falling through			1
the @entity10 striker was set to complete his move to @entity5 on sunday having joined them on their @entity14 tour , only for the @entity16 to announce he had failed a medical			1
but @entity2 believes it is impossible for @entity3 ’s fitness to be the real reason behind the collapse of the £ 8.5million deal			1
it does n’t make sense , ’ said the @entity42 ’s boss at the unveiling of new signing @entity44 on monday			1
‘ he had a stringent medical here , one at @entity33 , one at @entity36 and one with @entity25 before the @entity52			1
‘ he ’s never had a problem with his fitness			2
you could not meet a fitter lad			0
there ca n’t be any issue with his fitness			0
‘ i ca n’t see a medical reason			1
there must be other reasons			0
that ( failing medical ) is not possible			2
there has to be another reason			0
‘ he has never failed a medical before			1
he ’s never had a problem and did n’t miss a game at @entity36 ( where he spent last season on loan )			0
‘ they must have changed their mind or decided to go in another direction			0
’ reunited : @entity2 ( right ) and @entity44 worked together at @entity72 new start : @entity2 is delighted to have signed @entity44 for @entity10 new start : @entity44 has signed for @entity2 's @entity10 after 12 years at @entity74 no deal : @entity5 manager @entity76 , seen here at the end of his team 's 1 - 0 win over @entity80 in @entity81 on sunday night , described the collapse of an £ 8.5m move for @entity3 as ' unfortunate ' confused : @entity2 was shocked that @entity3 had failed his medical at @entity5 @entity3 could now return to @entity85 , and that is something @entity2 would welcome			1
‘ he will come back here , ’ he said			0
‘ their loss is our gain			0
i have got a fantastic striker capable of scoring 20 goals in the @entity95			2
‘ we need him now to come in here and get 20 goals			0
so from a selfish point of view i have got a great striker			2
‘ if he is here we will be delighted to have him back			0
