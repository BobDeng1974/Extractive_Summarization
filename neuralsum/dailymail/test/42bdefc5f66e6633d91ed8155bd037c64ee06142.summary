such has been the volatility at the top of the championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise , but what is certain is that @entity7 hold the aces			1
with just four weeks remaining , @entity10 's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times			1
seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but @entity7 know if they keep winning , they can not be caught			1
their buffer over second - placed @entity18 is a point with @entity20 , their opponents on monday , and @entity22 a point further back			1
@entity24 ( left ) of @entity7 celebrates his goal against @entity26 with his team mates another advantage for the @entity30 club is that their contest at @entity33 is a lunchtime kick - off			2
as they discovered on @entity36 , when they triumphed over relegation - threatened @entity26 , stealing a march can have a psychological effect			2
previous leaders @entity18 and 10 - man @entity20 could only draw , at @entity41 and @entity42 respectively , in the evening matches			1
' it definitely puts pressure on other teams , like @entity20 and @entity18 found on friday night , ' said @entity7 defender @entity47			1
' it gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp , as well			0
monday will be the same , big style			0
' @entity20 's 18 - goal striker @entity53 intends to have a say in what happens next			2
@entity53 helped @entity56 reach @entity57 in 2011 and admits he only signed for @entity20 to play in the @entity59 top flight			2
@entity53 rescued a point for @entity20 with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls @entity42 @entity18 have been this season 's surprise package and led the @entity65 for 101 days ' i came to @entity20 not because i want to play in the @entity65 but because i have the opportunity to be in the @entity69 , ' he said			1
' our fans have to scream from the start to the end			0
i know by @entity75 's grace we are going to win that game at home			0
' such is the precarious nature of the promotion race , however , that the division could have a completely different top two on monday evening if @entity20 and @entity22 , who host mid-table @entity82 , win and @entity18 fail to secure three points against @entity86			1
with the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that @entity10 is hoping @entity89 , his experienced captain , can continue to play through the pain			0
he missed the recent defeat at @entity18 due to his broken toe but returned against @entity26			1
crucially , each of the defender 's five appearances this season , and eight of his last nine , have resulted in wins			2
@entity99 ( left ) has impressed since taking over at @entity22 and the @entity22 remain in contention at the top @entity42 led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under @entity105 @entity42 , meanwhile , have seemingly forgotten how to win			1
seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but @entity105 insists he will not sacrifice his principles			0
@entity105 , who takes his team to @entity26 , said : ' i do n't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football			0
we have a certain way of playing , a certain style , which has got us where we are			0
' the eighth side in the division are @entity119 , who have the most potent striker in 28 - goal @entity122 , signed from @entity124 for Â£ 2million in january			0
@entity125 has made himself instantly at home and has @entity128 in his sights today			0
final word to the @entity59 forward : ' every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won			0
' welcome to the @entity65 rat race			1
additional reporting : @entity137 and @entity138			0

the race for promotion from the @entity65 is set to go to the wire
the top four teams in the second tier are separated by just two points
the next four sides in the table are covered by a single point
@entity18 spent 101 days at the top - the longest this season
