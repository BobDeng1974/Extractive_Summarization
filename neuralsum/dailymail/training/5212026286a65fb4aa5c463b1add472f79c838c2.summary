by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent ministers should spend up to £ 1billion of taxpayers ’ money to persuade lonely older people to use the internet , an influential think - tank said yesterday			1
encouraging the elderly to log on would ease the isolation of those who live alone while saving many millions for the @entity10 and in state - subsidised care home places , according to the @entity12			1
the cost of internet education for the more than six million people who do not know how to use it would amount to £ 875million – or £ 141 each – said the think - tank , which has close links to @entity19			1
but the savings would be almost double that			1
going online : more than six million people still do not know how to use the internet ( posed by models ) at present , four in ten over- 65s do not have access to the internet			1
the report said everyone in @entity29 should have the skills and confidence to go online by 2020			0
it added that one in ten patients who visit their gp do so because they are lonely rather than due to illness			0
isolated people are more likely to need emergency hospital beds or admission to care homes			0
the number of people aged 85 or over is set to double in the next 20 years , with many living hundreds of miles from family members			2
report author @entity45 said : ‘ in an increasingly isolated and fast moving world it is vital that everyone in society is able to use the internet and understand its benefits			2
‘ from alleviating social isolation , bringing together communities , paying bills and now accessing public services , online can improve lives			0
’ many pensioners visit gps or hospitals partly out of loneliness , said the think tank ( picture posed by models ) he added : ‘ being able to simply write an email or access a social networking site could provide older people with a way to stay connected to their friends and families , who may live hundreds of miles away			2
‘ maintaining these important relationships will help an ageing society vulnerable to loneliness			0
' some 29 per cent of people over 65 have still never used the internet , according to figures by the @entity80 issued in the first quarter of this year			0
among over- 75s nearly two in three , three million people , have never used the internet .			1

report was by the @entity12 , which has links to @entity19
internet education for six million people would cost £ 875m - or £ 141 each
but savings would double due to reduced *pressure* on gps and carers
