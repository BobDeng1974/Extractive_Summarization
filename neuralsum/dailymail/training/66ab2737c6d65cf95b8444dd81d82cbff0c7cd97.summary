a reptile store owner was arrested thursday in @entity1 , @entity2 , more than a year after his 100 - pound snake escaped and killed two young boys			1
@entity6 's lawyer confirmed his arrest , but said authorities had not yet pressed charges and it 's still unknown what crimes he may face			1
usually , police can only hold a suspect for 24 hours without an arraignment			0
it was on august 5 , 2013 that @entity6 's best friend 's two young sons @entity17 , 6 , and @entity18 , 4 , were killed during a sleepover at his apartment , located above his shop @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
@entity6 's lawyer @entity48 said thursday that the arrest did n't come as a surprise , considering the year - long investigation			1
however , she says her client was previously informed that charges would n't be pressed when the @entity54 wrapped up their investigation in july			0
' after they sort of recanted that position and announced that in fact the investigation was ongoing , then … i ca n't say that i ’m surprised that we 're at the point we 're at today , ' @entity48 told @entity63			0
animal lovers : @entity17 and @entity18 were the two sons of @entity6 's best friend @entity66 , who posted the following pictures of them playing around in his store to @entity36 little helpers : this picture posted to @entity17 and @entity18 's mother 's @entity36 page shows them cleaning out an enclosure for large reptiles at the store while charges have not been announced yet , there 's a strong chance that they will be related to the boys ' deaths as opposed to violations against the store			1
@entity6 's store was discovered to be unlicensed , but the @entity86 decided not to proceed with charges on those counts			1
those issues would have also been the responsibility of the local province - not the @entity54			0
at the time of the tragic incident , @entity92 spoke to a reptile expert briefed by police who said that the snake had escaped from its enclosure before and was ' an accident waiting to happen '			2
' this was preventable , if the snake had been kept safe and secure , ' @entity101 , curator of the @entity102 in @entity103 , told @entity92			0
the two boys spent the day with @entity6 and his son , swimming , barbecuing and playing with animals at a farm			2
@entity17 and @entity18 were the sons of @entity6 's best friend @entity110			1
a reptile expert previously told @entity92 that the snake could have been attracted to the two boys because of the scent of animals on their bodies			0
' sadly , the snake could have mistaken them for a food item , which they were n't ' , the owner of @entity117 in @entity103 said at the time			0
in a tragic twist of fate , the two boys would have usually spent saturday and sunday with their dad - but he was out of town on a trip to @entity125			0
change of plans : the boys usually spent saturday and sundays with their father - but he was out of town the night they were killed			2

arrest comes nearly a year and a half after his best friend 's two sons were killed by one of his snakes
