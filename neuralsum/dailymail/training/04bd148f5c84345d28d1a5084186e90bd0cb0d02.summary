@entity0 is now reliant on alcohol and feels as though she needs an evening tipple on sunday , i arrived home at around 5pm to be confronted with my worst nightmare : there was no wine in the house			1
not a single bottle , anywhere			2
and i know , because i searched high and low to find one			2
how on earth would i manage without my evening tipple ? i did n't			1
even though i 'd already had a drink at lunchtime , and even though i 'd just driven 50 miles in pouring rain to get home , i got back in the car and drove to the nearest supermarket			2
there , i picked up a couple of bottles of ready - chilled white wine — and despair and misery instantly turned to happiness			1
over the years , as i have hit 50 , 60 and now 70 , my dependence on alcohol has been steadily growing			1
at one time i could take it or leave it ; but no more			0
the quantity i consume has also increased			1
i would once take a bottle of wine to a friend 's dinner party , now i always take two			1
and there does n't seem as much wine in a bottle as there used to be			1
when eating out with a friend , we always order a bottle , saying we can take home what we do n't finish			1
but never once has that bottle accompanied us out of the restaurant			0
a few years ago , i was horrified when , at a dinner party , my sixty - something host and hostess had a bottle of wine each by their plates			1
but now i do the same			0
when my friend who drinks only red comes round ( i drink only white ) , we both have a bottle by our plates			1
the truth is that i , along with most of my sixty - plus women friends , never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it			1
these days , we are not so much ladies who lunch , as ladies who lurch			0
so i am not surprised by figures released yesterday revealing a fast - growing number of over- 60s seeking help for alcoholism			1
research from @entity72 says that 2,276 women over 60 sought professional help for problem drinking in 2013 - 14 , compared with 1,436 five years ago			1
serious drinking was once only for men — but somewhere along the line women caught up			1
along with our new , independent , social , self - sufficient lifestyles came the liberating fact that we could drink just like men do			1
today , we drink more than our mothers and grandmothers , and in a different way , too			0
alcohol is our modern feminist equivalent of a nice cup of cocoa in the evenings , or a @entity92 before bed			1
and we certainly do n't limit ourselves to a dainty sip of wine			1
nowadays , we drink as much as we want , whenever we want — and whatever the consequences			0
the demon drink has certainly got me into some scrapes			0
not long ago , friends had to help me into a taxi when they realised i was too drunk to drive home			0
the next day , i had to catch a train and another taxi to their house , 30 miles away , to retrieve my car			0
@entity107 , the shame of turning up contrite and sober — and with no recollection of the evening before			1
then there was the time i fell down unconscious in the street after a party where i just drank and drank , losing all restraint			1
i was taken to @entity115 in an ambulance , having hit my head , and kept in hospital until 4pm the next day			0
to this day , i have no idea who called the ambulance			0
once i was so drunk i left my handbag on a bus			0
thankfully , the bus stopped just up the road and a woman got out , waving my handbag			0
it 's not only teenagers who end up in bed with unsuitable men because they are wildly drunk			1
i have done it , too , even though i 'm old enough to know better			0
i was once staying in a hotel when , after a few too many at the bar , a man — a total stranger — followed me up to my room and knocked on my door			0
we ended up in bed together			0
i never saw him again , and was mortified at my behaviour			0
in recent years , my drinking has spread from an evening pursuit , as it was when i worked full - time , to more of an all - day affair			1
when i go to the cinema , i usually take half a bottle of wine in			1
i hardly remember the film the next day , but watching sober has become an impossibility			0
ice cream and popcorn just are n't the same			0
i can not remember the last time i watched a tv programme sober , either			0
@entity166 , @entity165 , @entity167 … all have passed me by in an alcoholic haze			0
my drinking has been fuelled by the fact that i now have my own ' cellar ' — a cupboard in my kitchen fitted out with a wine rack which can be replenished with just a click of a computer mouse on a supermarket website			1
online shopping means that as soon as i notice stock running low ( which happens with worrying frequency ) , i can book a home delivery			0
@entity182 knows what happened this weekend ! i still ca n't believe that i 'd forgotten to order			0
she said : ' the truth is that i , along with most of my sixty - plus women friends , never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it ' in the past , only men chose wine or ordered it for their cellars			1
but the internet lets women like me buy booze in secret			1
i can order an entire case with no one else being any the wiser			0
there is no one to see me lugging the wine to my car and unloading it at the other end			2
there is n't even a checkout assistant to give knowing glances			0
the only tricky part is spiriting the empty bottles out of the house to the recycling bank without too much clanking of glass			2
and because i live on my own , a 70 - year - old divorcee , there is no one around to tell me to stop			2
but it 's not just single women who are drinking more			1
i know lots of married women whose drinking has increased with age			1
some even say they 've re-bonded with their husbands over a shared enjoyment of a gin and tonic			0
that certainly was n't the way respectable married ladies once behaved			0
my grandmother might have indulged in a small glass of sherry at @entity232 , and my mother enjoyed a bottle of @entity236 's stout with her sunday lunch			2
it would never have occurred to them to drink any more than that			0
but then our entire lifestyles are different			0
my generation has been out in the world : we 've held down big jobs , earned our own money , had busy social lives and enjoyed our independence			0
according to the new research , most elderly problem drinkers are professional women			1
having got used to the crutch of alcohol during our working lives , our drinking really takes off when we retire			1
armed with good pensions , today 's older women can afford to buy wine in more or less unlimited quantities			1
there are other drivers , too			0
i live alone and , like many divorcees , sometimes drink to alleviate loneliness and boredom			0
i seem to reconnect with myself when i drink			0
while time drags during the day , it speeds by once i 'm drinking			2
alcohol makes my thoughts come alive			2
it makes me feel like a human being again , rather than a lost soul wondering what to do			0
of course , drinking does sometimes prove dangerous			2
one close friend drank herself to death after her husband died			2
her drinking had gradually escalated until she needed a bottle of vodka to get through the day , and she just would n't seek help			2
but older women trying to cut down rarely succeed			2
one friend now drinks every other day , rather than every day — but on the days she drinks , she is drinking twice as much as before			1
at times , i 've worried that my own drinking was out of hand			2
last @entity232 , i cut out wine altogether , just to see if i could			2
i managed — but only just			0
and it was sheer , unadulterated hell			0
i celebrated @entity290 with a ' mocktail ' — a sickly - sweet fruity drink — and for a whole fortnight was crotchety , bad - tempered and sulky			2
in the end , one of my sons begged me to get back on the wine			2
after two weeks of self - denial , reuniting with my reliable friend was a heady experience			1
i was immediately back to half a bottle of wine ( at least ) a day , even though i promised myself i 'd try to keep to just one glass			2
so , what is my health like after more than 40 years of daily drinking , often to excess ? well , i 'm sorry to disappoint any doom - and - gloom merchants , but it 's perfect			1
i 'm in much better nick than most 70 - year - olds , and when i had medical tests five years ago , i was told i had the innards of a 30 - year - old			1
i do try to minimise health risks by going to the gym every day and watching what i eat			0
in a way , my whole lifestyle is ordered to accommodate my drinking			2
i also kid myself that i can keep my drinking within safe limits , even if i am exceeding my self - imposed quota ( not to mention the two units a day that the government recommends women stick to )			1
indeed , the only problem with my drinking is keeping my wine cellar stocked — and avoiding another late - night supermarket dash .			1
