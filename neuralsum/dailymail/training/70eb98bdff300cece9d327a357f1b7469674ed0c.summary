@entity14 was born by emergency caesarean section but she struggled to breathe and died after only 32 minutes			1
hospital officials tried to claim the baby was stillborn and so her death did not need to be investigated			1
but her parents @entity1 and @entity2 always maintained their daughter had been alive			1
they fought for an inquest until – after two years – the hospital finally admitted that @entity23 had not been stillborn , allowing the scrutiny of a hearing			1
her death followed those of two other babies at @entity28 in similar circumstances , when the mothers had to wait for a caesarean to be carried out			2
following the latest tragedy , coroner @entity32 has ordered managers to report all stillbirths and neonatal deaths to him for further investigation			0
mrs @entity38 , a teacher , 31 , said : ‘ people questioned my sanity and it was infuriating because i knew my baby had been alive			2
i was grief - stricken and vulnerable and you just accept what health professionals tell you			0
‘ but when they handed me that stillborn certificate , i knew something was n’t right			0
then a meeting with our consultant opened up a whole can of worms and highlighted a number of errors that had been made			0
’ @entity23 ’s death in september 2009 came when the maternity unit was still reeling from criticism into the death of another baby , @entity58 , four months before			1
then , mr @entity32 had condemned staff shortages which contributed to her demise as ‘ nothing short of scandalous ’			0
the deaths of the two girls bear an uncanny resemblance			0
both went into distress and both mothers had to wait a considerable time for caesareans			0
@entity23 , like @entity71 , would very probably be alive today had the surgery been carried out sooner , the inquest heard			1
the loss of a third baby girl , @entity75 in 2007 in similar circumstances , in the same unit also prompted criticism from the coroner at the time			0
mr @entity32 delivered a narrative verdict at @entity23 ’s inquest at @entity28 @entity82			1
‘ there was a failure to recognise the seriousness of her ( @entity23 ’s ) condition and a delay in carrying out the emergency caesarean section , ’ he said			1
the coroner ruled that if the surgery had been carried out earlier ‘ on the balance of probabilities @entity23 would have survived ’			2
mrs @entity38 , of @entity28 , was admitted when 36 weeks ’ pregnant , suffering with pre-eclampsia , the court heard			0
tragic : @entity38 's death followed those of two other babies at @entity28 in similar circumstances she had previously had an mri scan which showed she had a ‘ borderline pelvis ’ making a natural delivery risky			0
but mrs @entity38 was not told of this risk and was not given the option of a caesarean section			1
instead , she was induced and a short time later , began to bleed with @entity23 becoming distressed in the womb , the court was told			2
but doctors delayed the decision to carry out an emergency caesarean for one hour and 25 minutes			1
when it was finally performed , the baby was born in a ‘ very poor condition ’ and despite resuscitation , died shortly after			1
after last month ’s inquest , mrs @entity38 and her husband , who works in graphics , will finally be able to register @entity23 ’s birth			1
the couple , who later had another daughter , @entity120 , now two , said they were devastated by the hospital ’s blunder			2
‘ it has taken us years to get to this stage and we feel quite bitter it took this long for the hospital to concede they had made a mistake , ’ said mrs @entity38			2
‘ they have destroyed my life and took my child away			0
it is utterly devastating and has totally changed me			0
‘ this is not the first case where the hospital has been forced to face questions about its practice of declaring babies “ stillborn ” , thereby avoiding an inquest			1
‘ it is particularly distressing that our baby would still be with us today had the caesarean taken place earlier			2
hopefully the verdict will be acted upon so other parents will be spared the pain we have had to endure simply to discover the truth			0
’ as a direct result of @entity23 ’s death , the coroner has ruled that all stillbirths and neonatal deaths in his area will have to reported so he can decide if an inquest should be called			1
hospital medical director @entity158 said maternity services had been significantly improved , ensuring such an incident should never occur again			0
he added : ‘ clinical staff made an error in classifying @entity23 as a stillbirth			2
’ the hospital has apologised for the ‘ unimaginable distress ’ caused by her death			0
its maternity services were given a clean bill of health by inspectors in april 2011 .			0
