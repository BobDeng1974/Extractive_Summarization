@entity0 wanted to get his point across			1
leaning against a wall not far from @entity6 ’s dressing room , the topic of @entity3 had arisen and @entity0 was ready to talk			1
‘ please give him what he deserves , ’ @entity0 implored			1
‘ he was signed in the most difficult market for players ( january ) so the second half of last season was a space of improvement and adaptation for him			2
at this moment , he ’s a giant			2
not for his size but for the way he plays			0
the man is a giant			0
’ among the many in blue shirts who had starred during @entity6 ’s commanding 2 - 1 victory at @entity27 , from the beguiling @entity28 to the combative @entity29 , nobody surpassed the hulking @entity31 enforcer , who trampled all over @entity32 ’ s ambitions			1
@entity0 ( left ) has praised the impact of @entity3 ( right ) since joining @entity6 in january @entity3 ( left ) celebrates @entity6 pulling level against @entity32 on sunday through a @entity36 ( right ) goal @entity0 ( above ) gives his team an instruction in @entity6 's 2 - 1 win over @entity32 at @entity27 on saturday @entity6 are moving relentlessly towards the title and , should they achieve their objective , it is inevitable that members of the @entity46 battalion will be scoop both the @entity48 and @entity50 awards			1
@entity52 , of course , will command his share of the votes			0
@entity55 , too , for the artistry and style he has provided			0
@entity0 ’s two major summer signings have made huge contributions to @entity6 's unblemished start			1
but why not matic ? he wo n’t take the breath away with skill , he wo n’t be chipping in with a bundle of goals but his importance to @entity6 in the games that matter is beyond question			1
@entity27 did n’t bother him in the same way he never batted an eyelid at the @entity70 or @entity71			1
@entity72 has changed over the last decade , with a different type of midfielder , emerging but @entity3 is a throwback , a man who will shield his defence in the same way @entity78 and @entity79 did			1
and , just like those two warriors , he knows how to play			0
‘ @entity3 is a player who gives balance to a team , ’ @entity52 , @entity81 ’s sporting director , told @entity82 earlier this year			1
‘ he is someone with a great positioning and he is intelligent in the way he moves and passes the ball			0
he is an outstanding player			0
’ @entity3 ( left ) battles @entity90 ( centre ) and @entity91 ( right ) for possession as @entity6 beat @entity32 @entity32 's @entity93 ( left ) tries to keep the ball as @entity3 ( right ) attempts to close him down he is every inch a @entity0 player , the engine of this team			1
he covered 12.4km against @entity32 at the weekend , destroying everything that came near him ; he won five tackles and used the ball sensibly when it came to his feet			0
those numbers match what he did at the @entity104 , when 100 per cent of his challenges were successful ; that day his passing accuracy was 88.46 per cent and he ran 11.5km			0
the example he is setting is drive @entity6 forward			1
‘ i was a champion in different countries with different clubs and there are points that are always present , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i had it here in my first spell and i ’m having it now			0
you have to have people who are ready to sacrifice themselves , people that push to help			0
i ’m so pleased about that			0
’ such is the esteem in which @entity0 holds @entity3 , he chose him to deliver the team talk at @entity27			1
it is a tactic the @entity6 manage uses every week but , given the venue , it was significant that the @entity31 was handed the responsibility			2
‘ everyone has their place in the team and knows what it is , ’ @entity126 explained			2
‘ the whole squad know we have to fight together			0
some players have more talent , some score goals , and sometimes we have to defend for them			0
but the main thing is we do it all as a team			2
@entity3 ( right ) left @entity6 to play for @entity81 in @entity141 , but returned to @entity46 in january @entity126 ( left ) celebrates @entity6 's 2 - 1 win at @entity27 alongside captain @entity29 ( right ) at full time @entity3 ( left ) , @entity29 ( third right ) and @entity126 ( second right ) celebrate the victory with their team - mates ‘ @entity3 said that if we wanted to be champions we had to win			1
if that is the target – to be champions – then you have to come to these sort of stadiums and get a result			0
he said would be really hard but we have to do a great job – and we have to win			2
’ the intensity of his words matched the intensity of his performance			0
@entity3 is not an artist but , of the all signings @entity0 has made since returning to @entity46 , his decision to bring back the 26 - year - old from @entity81 for a second spell might just be the smartest			1
should @entity3 continue in such devastating form , he will give his fellow professionals something to think about			2
as @entity0 says , it is credit he deserves .			2

@entity0 lauds midfielder @entity3 's *display* at @entity27
the @entity6 boss allowed @entity3 to take the team - talk before kick - off
@entity3 dominated the midfield as @entity6 came from behind to win 2 - 1
