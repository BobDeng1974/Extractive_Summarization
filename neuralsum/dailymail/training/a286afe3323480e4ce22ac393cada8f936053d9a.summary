in 2011 - 12 , 1.62 million pupils were labelled as having some form of learning difficulty ( file picture ) @entity17 diagnoses have been viewed with some suspicion as they can be used to claim extra funds and are taken into account when assessing exam results - potentially improving a school 's place in league tables			1
three years ago a damning @entity25 report estimated 450,000 children had been classed as @entity17 to hide poor teaching			0
