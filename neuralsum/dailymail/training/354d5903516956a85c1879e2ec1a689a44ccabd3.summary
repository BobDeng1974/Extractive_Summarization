and also joked about his time in hospital : ' i was waking up a bit three days after and the surgeon said " you 're a very lucky boy @entity6 " and i said " hmm i do n't know about that "			1
' ' someone always told me that @entity67 gives the toughest challenges to his best soldiers and that 's the way i 'm taking it and the only way you can take it , ' he said			2
after initially being told he would never walk again , a full recovery is a realistic goal for @entity6 who says he has come to terms with his situation			1
@entity6 said he tried to maintain upbeat - focusing on his rehabilitation - but he did have his ' low points '			2
' they 're pretty bad ... [ but ] it would only be 20 minutes or 30 minutes , ' he said			0
' hopefully i can impact on the game another way			0
' @entity9 ( right ) breaks down as he describes how he was ' living a lie ' and not letting his emotions over @entity6 's ( left ) accident out in the open former @entity1 @entity11 player @entity6 ( right ) and coach @entity9 ( behind ) will speak about @entity6 's accident on the @entity11 on thursday night the interview was particularly emotional for his coach @entity9 who announced last week he would be leaving the side at the end of the season			1

' i was very confused with myself , very confused			0
i did n't feel as emotional as i thought i should and then it dawned on me that i was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because i could n’t afford to			2
' but i 've shed a lot of tears since about him ... and i suppose i 'll shed some more			2
' it 's good to get it off my chest			2
' he later added during his first live appearance on the @entity11 : ' it 's the toughest thing that 's happened for me in rugby league			1

' as much as i would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to @entity1 and get on with my life , i want to walk again , ' @entity6 said on monday			1
' you see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and do n't walk again			2
my focus is to get as much back of my movement as i can and i am slowly improving			0
' for example , when i first got diagnosed i was a @entity133 - all that is shoulder movement			0
no fingers , no movement in your legs , or anything like that			0
' i am slowly progressing with the movement , i am a @entity143 now			0
' @entity1 player @entity6 was tackled by @entity36 players , with his head hitting the ground first and causing severe spinal injuries @entity6 suffered the devastating spinal injury in march but he promised he would walk his fiancée down the aisle ' it 's going to be a slow and long process but i am willing to do that			1
' i 'm 22 and i 'm going to give it my best shot			0
' @entity6 says he does n't remember the round three incident at @entity36 's @entity157 , only the aftermath of ' the whole ground looking at me '			1
' obviously being thrown into a situation like this you do n't know how to handle it but the people around me and their help has really motivated me to get back to the person that i am , ' he said			2
' there is no point of me being angry			0
you would think i would be filthy on the world and filthy on the game but i 'm not			0
you may as well be content with the situation			0
' what rugby league has done for myself and my life is ridiculous and i would n't be the person i am today without it			0
i would n't have met @entity9 [ @entity9 ]			1
i would n't have met some of my best mates			0
i would n't change it for anything			0

' he was very valuable before he was injured and he 's more valued now because we all feel his pain , ' @entity9 said			2
' he 's a pretty outstanding young man and he 's become even more outstanding in my eyes since the accident because he 's made sure it has been easier for all of us			0
' despite all the pain and all the grief and all that is in front of him he is more concerned about us and how we feel and when we come to see him he 's always putting on a brave face			0
