former @entity1 child prodigy @entity0 will start a trial with @entity3 on monday having been without a club since an unsuccessful spell with @entity7 side @entity6 in 2013			1
the 25 - year - old attacker was a member of @entity11 's 2008 @entity10 team , but he has never fulfilled the potential that saw him burst on to the global scene when he signed for @entity15 side @entity14 at the age of 14 in 2004			1
the @entity18 club announced the trial on their website on sunday , with a message saying they hoped the success of former @entity3 star and @entity0 's old @entity11 under - 20 team - mate @entity25 would inspire him to new heights			1
great expectations : so much was expected of @entity0 when he signed an @entity15 contract at the age of 14 world at his feet : @entity0 dribbles past @entity33 internationals @entity31 and @entity34 in 2008 @entity0 , the only player to score hat - tricks in the @entity36 and at an under - 20 @entity37 , played with @entity25 at youth level , and even set up both of his goals in a 2 - 1 win against @entity42 at the @entity36 - 20 @entity37 in 2007			1
despite his clear promise , @entity0 has never lived up to the hype that saw him labelled ' the next @entity45 ' , and though he has been capped 17 times for @entity11 his club career has since him travel between continents in search of regular football			2
playing against the best : @entity0 jostles for possession with @entity53 and @entity42 legend @entity54 international : @entity0 controls the ball during a @entity37 qualifier against @entity57 in @entity58 in 2006 he moved to @entity59 , before @entity61 giants @entity60 signed him a year later			2
he dabbled in @entity62 after failing to hold down a first - team spot in @entity64 , joining @entity65 on loan for the 2008/09 season			0
the next season he was back in @entity61 with @entity68 , before he moved to @entity70 side @entity69 in january 2010			0
thirteen months after that he joined @entity73 's @entity72 , but that spell was short - lived and he returned to the @entity1 half a year later			0
@entity75 : @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity60 against @entity76 during a league match in 2007 @entity0 finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at @entity15 side @entity78 , only to suddenly join @entity6 in april 2013			0
he was released by @entity6 in november and had trials with @entity80 in february and in june former @entity1 boss @entity81 offered him a chance at @entity84 side @entity83			0
@entity0 failed to impress @entity81 enough to secure a long - term deal , which has led to his latest trial , at @entity87 's @entity3			1
seemingly settled : @entity0 spent two years at @entity78 before jumping ship to try his luck in @entity42			0

@entity0 signed for @entity14 in 2004 but has never lived up to his potential
the attacker has plied his trade at nine clubs in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , since making his debut in 2004
@entity3 are latest club to offer the former child prodigy a trial
the @entity18 side hope he is inspired by former @entity3 star @entity25
