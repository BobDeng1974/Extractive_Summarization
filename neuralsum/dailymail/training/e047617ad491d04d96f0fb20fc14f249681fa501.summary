all the best school science experiments carry at least a hint of danger			0
but when 13 - year - old @entity4 informed his stunned headmaster of his plan to build a nuclear reactor in a classroom , the obvious question was : ‘ will it blow the school up ? ’ fortunately , in a victory for the spirit of amateur scientific discovery over the health and safety culture , @entity4 ’s promise that it was perfectly safe was believed			1
13 - year - old @entity4 has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor and yesterday he became the youngest person in the world to achieve nuclear fusion from scratch at his @entity22 secondary school , using high energy to smash two hydrogen atoms together to make helium			1
‘ it is quite an achievement			0
it ’s magnificent really , ’ @entity4 said afterwards			2
‘ i ca n’t quite believe it – even though all my friends think i am mad			2
’ @entity4 , who attends @entity30 near @entity31 , has been fascinated with radiation for years , on one occasion even buying a @entity35 counter with his @entity37 money			2
his fusion ambition was sparked by reading about a 14 - year - old @entity40 schoolboy , @entity39 , who had become the youngest to produce a small fusion reactor in @entity42 in 2008			1
‘ i looked at it , thought “ that looks cool ” and decided to have a go , ’ @entity4 added			1
head teacher @entity46 congratulates @entity4 as a @entity35 counter registers the fusion reaction @entity4 ( pictured ) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than @entity40 @entity39 who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008 @entity4 's first step was to enlist help from nuclear laboratories and university departments , but ‘ they did n’t seem to take me seriously ’			1
nuclear fusion is one of the most promising options for generating large amounts of carbon - free energy in the future			1
to get energy from fusion , gas from a combination of types of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – is heated to very high temperatures ( 100 million ° c )			0
one way to achieve these conditions is a method called ‘ magnetic confinement ' – controlling the hot gas with strong magnets			0
@entity4 was inspired by @entity39 's technique which used something known as ' @entity81			0
' this method uses electric fields to do the work on charged particles - either ions or electrons - allowing them to be heated to fusion conditions			0
so that left the laboratories at his school , and the task of convincing headmaster @entity46			1
fortunately the head agreed , coming up with the necessary £ 3,000 funding			0
‘ i was a bit stunned and i have to say a little nervous when @entity4 suggested this but he reassured me he would n’t blow the school up , ’ mr @entity46 said yesterday			1
after months of work , the reactor was finally completed just ahead of his 14th birthday this weekend			0
and yesterday , in a ‘ radiation controlled area ’ in a classroom , before an audience of experts , he flicked a switch and stared intently at his @entity35 counter until it registered that fusion had indeed taken place – or created ‘ a star in a jar ’ , as @entity4 refers to it			1
nuclear fusion , the reaction that powers the sun , is very different from nuclear fission , or the splitting of the atom , that occurs in nuclear power stations and is the stuff of atom bombs			1
however , both release vast amounts of energy			0
@entity4 started building the reactor in october at the science laboratory at @entity30 , @entity22 , and finally finished the task this morning in an incredible eureka moment head teacher @entity46 can be seen pointing to the experiment as a @entity35 counter registers @entity4 's fusion reaction has taken place the landmark experiment took place at school in @entity139 , near @entity31 scientists around the world are replicating @entity4 ’s experiment , but on a much bigger scale , in the hope of using it on a large scale to fuel cheap , environmentally - friendly power stations			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i heard the @entity35 counter rapidly go up and i was “ what is that ? ” , ’ he said in the afterglow of success			1
‘ then i looked over and the neutron counter was right up off the scale nearly , and i thought “ we must have done it ”			0
’ the experiment was assisted by electronics experts who tested the apparatus for safety , while @entity4 , his friend @entity160 and the teachers involved had all attended a risk assessment course at a nuclear fuel company			2
for his next project , @entity4 – who wants to be a nuclear engineer or work in theoretical physics – has his sights set on building a miniature hadron collider			2
trying to rise the funds was n't easy			0
@entity4 said : ' i went to various nuclear laboratories and universities and they did n't seem to take me seriously ' @entity4 said : ' it is quite an achievement			2
i ca n't quite believe it '			0

@entity4 ' reactor was able to smash two hydrogen atoms together
this made him youngest person to create helium through nuclear fusion
@entity187 took place in a controlled environment at his school in @entity22
head teacher @entity46 said : ‘ i was a little nervous when @entity4 suggested this but he reassured me he would n’t blow the school up '
