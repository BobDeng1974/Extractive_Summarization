by @entity0 for @entity1 speaker @entity2 has come under fire for his choice of @entity5 for @entity6 commons speaker @entity2 will tomorrow face mps for the first time since a row erupted over his recommended candidate for the post of clerk of the @entity13			1
he will reportedly make a statement in the chamber amid growing disquiet among critics of the choice of @entity19 @entity5 , who is currently head of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in @entity21			1
members have voiced concerns about her lack of knowledge of @entity28 procedures and believe she is too inexperienced for the prestigious £ 200,000 - a - year position , which combines the clerk 's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of commons chief executive			1
she has been dubbed the ' @entity21 caterer ' because her responsibilities at the @entity19 senate are said to include managing kitchens and cleaning			1
in an effort to defuse the row , mr @entity2 , who is expected to visit @entity19 next month , has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs , but the suggestion has failed to appease the critics led by @entity49 @entity48			1
the @entity50 and @entity52 mp has submitted a motion calling for @entity54 to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment			2
it has since been signed by 84 members from across the political spectrum , including three former foreign secretaries , a former deputy leader of the @entity62 and six former ministers			0
all three deputy speakers are also understood to be against the choice of ms @entity66			2
writing in the @entity67 , mr @entity48 said : ' so far there has not been any indication that @entity54 will be given a say on this matter			1
nor has the appointment of ms @entity5 been withdrawn			2
' @entity21 caterer ' : @entity5 ' appointment has been criticised by mps from all parties , led by @entity77 ' instead it has been proposed that the role of clerk should be split and a new chief executive ( presumably ms @entity66 ) be appointed as well			1
' this effectively concedes that ms @entity5 is not qualified to be clerk			2
but instead of dropping her and starting again , it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on - the - hoof restructuring of the @entity13 , all it seems , in order to accommodate her appointment			0
' not only that - it proposes a new role of chief executive at a probable cost of £ 150,000 - £ 200,000			0
' @entity5 is the current @entity96 secretary in @entity21 , @entity19 , a service department that supports the work of the @entity54 and is the principal support agency for @entity13			1
it works closely with the @entity101 and @entity102 to support the operations of the @entity54 and its committees , has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $ 120 million			0
she is the former director general of @entity107 and the @entity108			0
he condemned the appointment process as ' flawed ' , because key people such as deputy speaker @entity62 mp @entity112 had not been included			2
he also criticised the use of head hunters , adding : ' it is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was , and remains , under investigation in @entity19 for maladministration			1
' mr @entity48 warned that if allowed to drag on the affair could damage the office of speaker and , in turn , the @entity125			1
he added : ' we must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment [ in his statement tomorrow ] , reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials and put the wider issue of clerkship before a special committee elected by @entity75			1
' former deputy speaker @entity136 added on the @entity138 programme that the real issue was whether mr @entity2 would have the ' guts ' to stand up and tell the @entity13 ms @entity66 was no longer the appointee			1
he went on : ' it has transpired that while she is very good at administration apparently she knows nothing about the constitution and would n't know what @entity147 is for instance , which is the bible of the chamber			2
mp @entity48 , who is leading the attack on @entity2 's choice of @entity5 ' in the meantime the speaker has said why do n't we split the job			1
well , if we split the job which may have some sense may not , do n't you re-open the appointment panel again to have a look ? ' the real issue is whether @entity2 is going to have the guts tomorrow to stand up in @entity54 and say @entity5 is no longer the appointee of a position that really now does n't exist			1
we need a panel to be set up to look at the job , what sort of job it is first and once we have sorted out what the job is then we can look at the candidates			0
' meanwhile , an influential committee of members will meet tomorrow to discuss the speaker 's expected statement			1
@entity174 , chairman of the public administration select committee , said he would be arguing for a pre-appointment hearing with ms @entity66 if she is to be appointed to either the post of clerk or chief executive due to the need for scrutiny			0
ms @entity5 was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by the speaker			1
mr @entity2 is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the @entity13 , rather than promoting deputy clerk @entity189			2
@entity190 has insisted the new clerk must have the backing of @entity194 prime minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the @entity196 to be finalised			0
a spokeswoman for the speaker told the @entity67 : ' the speaker is keen to listen to the views of mps			0
' she said his visit to @entity19 was planned a year ago and added that @entity205 visits to meet other speakers were an ' important element ' of his job			2
the @entity6 is the impartial main political adviser to the @entity13 , and adviser on all its procedure and business			0
they often appear before @entity215 to examine @entity217 and constitutional matters			0
they sit at the @entity219 , and wear court dress , with a barrister 's wig and silk robes			0
the @entity224 of the table are consulted by the chair , ministers , @entity228 , and mps on any matter that may arise in the conduct of a sitting			0
they also act as the chief executive of the @entity234 , which is made up of 2,000 people , and chairs the @entity236			0
the current clerk is sir @entity238 , who has held the position since october 1 , 2011 , and was knighted the following year			0
on april 30 , he announced he intended to retire at the end of august , after four decades in the @entity13 .			0
