by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 20:40 est , 13 november 2012 former mp @entity1 , one of the last politicians investigated over the scandal , stood down at the 2010 general election disgraced former @entity7 mp @entity1 cheated the taxpayer out of £ 53,000 in one of the worst cases of fraud to emerge from the parliamentary expenses scandal , a jury found yesterday			1
but despite the damning verdict , 57 - year - old @entity13 will not be punished after a judge ruled she was too depressed to stand trial			2
as a consequence , the former mp for @entity18 will not even receive a criminal record although the jury in the rare ‘ trial of issue ’ ruled that she had committed 21 counts of fraud			1
last night , anti-sleaze campaigners reacted with astonishment to the news that @entity13 will not be jailed			2
it is also unclear whether any steps can be taken to reimburse the public purse			0
@entity13 is the fifth mp to face criminal proceedings for abusing parliamentary allowances			1
between april 2004 and august 2008 she submitted fraudulent claims of around £ 60,000 – more than double that of any of the other four mps who have been tried – of which she received more than £ 53,000			1
@entity13 did not have to appear at @entity39 nor enter a plea to the 15 charges of false accounting and six of using false information after a judge ruled her ‘ severe depressive disorder ’ meant she was unable to defend herself			0
the charges included submitting ‘ bogus ’ invoices for more than £ 22,000 for goods and services which did not exist			1
the jury found that the case against ‘ broken woman ’ @entity13 , who earned a £ 64,766 salary as an mp , was ‘ proved ’			1
mr @entity56 said he can not ‘ punish her as such ’ through a prison sentence or fine			0
instead , he can give her a hospital order , supervision order or absolute discharge			0
he adjourned his decision but indicated a supervision order is most likely			0
meanwhile , @entity13 is being treated by psychiatrists at home in @entity67			2
last night former anti-sleaze mp @entity68 said : ‘ i am lost for words			2
what she did was an appalling abuse of public trust			0
i am amazed that so far only four mps have ended up in jail			0
she should count herself very lucky that she is not the fifth			0
’ ms @entity1 's appearance has changed dramatically since the 2010 election and she was found unfit to stand trial due to mental health issues @entity82 , chief executive of the @entity83 ’ @entity81 , added : ‘ the verdict does not feel like justice done			0
’ the court heard how @entity13 , an mp from 1997 until her resignation in 2010 , ‘ abused ’ the system of claiming parliamentary expenses , which was largely based on trust			1
@entity92 , prosecuting , said mps were permitted to receive expenses for a designated second home , but she had twice swapped the designation of her second home ‘ in a process known as flipping ’			1
she had exploited the system to ‘ kit out ’ homes in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity67			0
in 2006 she submitted a claim for £ 4,756.40 for replacement kitchen units for her second home , which was accompanied by an invoice from a firm called @entity109 that was a ‘ complete forgery ’			1
a year later , she submitted invoices for £ 14,805 and £ 1,823 for work in the name of @entity114 , but the bills were ‘ utterly false ’			0
in 2008 , she ‘ flipped ’ her designated home to @entity67 , which belonged to her then fiancé and now husband @entity118			1
she submitted false bills for £ 22,500 of building work at this property , including dry rot repairs , which was for work completed in the previous financial year , when she had already exhausted her parliamentary allowance , and when her designated second home was in @entity103 .			2

jury rules former @entity18 mp claimed for *boilers* which did not exist and ' flipped ' home to claim almost annual limit in single bill
total claims were bigger than any other fraud *unearthed* in @entity93 ' expenses scandal
