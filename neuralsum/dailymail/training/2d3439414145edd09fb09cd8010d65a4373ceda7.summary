by @entity1 reporter published : 06:36 est , 11 april 2012 updated : 03:42 est , 12 april 2012 a star count shows how many areas of @entity4 are cut off from seeing some of the most spectacular constellations in the sky half of @entity4 can not see a starry sky at night because of light pollution , a study has found			1
glaring beams from streetlamps , shops and offices are creating an artificially bright landscape , says the @entity16			0
it found 53 per cent of us could see fewer than ten stars in the @entity21 constellation – slightly fewer than last year			1
campaigners said that despite initiatives to reduce light pollution ‘ the contamination of @entity4 night skies continues largely unchecked ’			1
together with the @entity27 , they are calling for a reduction in light pollution which not only thwarts stargazers , but affects wildlife and human sleeping patterns			0
the research was carried out by around 1,000 volunteers who counted the stars they could see on a clear night in january and february			1
just 2 per cent had truly dark skies , seeing 31 or more stars - concentrated in rural spots in the @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity21 is one of the most easily recognisable constellations in the world and visible in @entity4 from november to february			1
@entity45 , of the @entity16 , said unnecessary light ‘ damages the character of the countryside ’			0
she added : ‘ of course we need the right , well - designed lighting in the right places … but there should not be a blanket assumption that glaring lights are needed			2
’ ‘ the evidence gathered during this year ’s star count week shows that we need to take action now to roll back the spread of light pollution			0
’ and she warned : ‘ when we saturate the night sky with unnecessary light , it damages the character of the countryside and blurs the distinction between town and country			0
@entity71 constellation from @entity72 : the orbiting telescope is ( obviously ) not affected by light pollution the @entity75 said dozens of local authorities had been trialling the dimming of street lights at night			1
@entity79 of the @entity80 , said : ‘ light pollution is a disaster for anyone trying to study the stars			2
it ’s like a veil of light is being drawn across the night sky , denying many people the beauty of a truly starry night			0
‘ many children growing up today will never see the @entity92 ; never see the unimaginable glory of billions of visible stars shining above them			2
’ a spokesman from the @entity96 said : ‘ new national planning rules provide strong protection against light pollution			0
‘ the national planning framework makes clear that councils should limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light when making planning decisions .			0

more than half of @entity4 can see 10 or less stars in @entity21
local authorities spend *£* *529* billion on street lighting
