the @entity1 doctor who carried the ebola virus from @entity3 to @entity4 , riding the subway and going bowling before symptoms developed , said the public was never properly educated about the disease			0
dr @entity10 , an emergency room physician , penned an article for wednesday 's @entity13 that blamed politicians and media outlets for fanning fears			1
' when we look back on this epidemic , i hope we 'll recognize that fear caused our initial hesitance to respond - and caused us to respond poorly when we finally did , ' @entity10 wrote			1
slammed : dr @entity10 penned an article for the @entity13 attacking the media and politicians for alarmist reports and attempts to use the @entity28 outbreak for political gain the emergency room physician treated patients in @entity3 with the @entity32 , before returning to the @entity1 last october			1
he developed symptoms consistent with those of @entity28 and was diagnosed on october 23 , just days after arriving in the @entity1			0
media reports about @entity10 's diagnosis , the first in @entity4 , focused on how he rode the subway , went out to eat and even went bowling between his return and the diagnosis			1
little attention , @entity10 argued , was spent on how the disease is known to be transmitted , and that research points to it being ' nearly impossible for me to have transmitted the virus before i had a fever			2
' @entity10 also bemoaned how he was described as a ' a fraud , a hipster and a hero ' at the same time by news reports			0
' the truth is , i am none of those things , ' he said			0
' i â€™m just someone who answered a call for help and was lucky enough to survive			0
' responding : @entity10 traveled to @entity3 in order to treat @entity28 patients , returning in october and being diagnosed shortly after his arrival in the @entity1 engaged : @entity10 's fiancee , @entity62 , was admitted to the hospital after @entity10 's diagnosis but was soon released ' meanwhile , politicians , caught up in the election season , took advantage of the panic to try to appear presidential instead of supporting a sound , science - based public health response , ' he added			1
following @entity10 's diagnosis , @entity4 governor @entity72 and @entity74 gov @entity73 announced 21 - day quarantines for those arriving in either state after working with @entity28 patients			1
each governor painted federal health guidelines as inadequate during their announcements , but @entity10 called such talk counter productive			0
they ' enacted strict home quarantine rules without sufficiently considering the unintended side effects , ' namely encouraging those exposed to lie out of fear of quarantine			0
the sick , according to @entity10 , would opt not to seek treatment while caregivers working with @entity28 patients would ' alter their travel plans or misreport their exposure to avoid quarantine			2
' another voice criticizing politicians ' reactions to the outbreak of @entity28 in @entity98 , which had caused the deaths of 3,416 in @entity100 as well as hitting @entity101 and @entity3 , was nurse @entity102			1
in an op - ed in the @entity104 , @entity102 explained her frustration over being labeled the ' ebola nurse ' by @entity107 in spite of her never having symptoms of the virus			2
' this is what did happen : i was quarantined against my will by overzealous politicians after i volunteered to go and treat people affected by @entity28 in west @entity98 , ' she wrote			0
' @entity73 and my governor in @entity120 , @entity121 , decided to disregard medical science and the constitution in hopes of advancing their careers , ' she added			2
@entity10 was released on november 11 having cleared the virus with the help of a blood plasma transfusion from an @entity28 survivor			0
' we all lose when we allow irrational fear , fueled in part by prime - time ratings and political expediency , to supersede pragmatic public health preparedness , ' @entity10 wrote .			1

dr @entity10 wrote in the @entity13 calling out the governors who imposed a quarantine after his diagnosis
he said that little of the science behind *transmission* was explained in the media
his criticism echoes that of nurse @entity102 , who was quarantined in @entity74 and later @entity120 after returning from @entity100
