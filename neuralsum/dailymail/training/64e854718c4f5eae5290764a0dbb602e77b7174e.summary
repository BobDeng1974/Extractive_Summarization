more than a third of children now live with unmarried parents in non-traditional families , according to official figures			2
only 63 per cent of dependent youngsters lived in a home headed by a married couple last year , according to the @entity8 – a drop of three percentage points on 2004			0
by contrast , the proportion of dependent children – classed as under - 16s and those aged 16 to 18 in school or college – living with cohabiting parents rose over the same period from 11 per cent to 14 per cent			1
new figures show only 63 per cent of dependent youngsters lived in a home headed by a married couple last year ( file picture ) the fall in the share of children in married homes comes at a time of growing evidence that marriage is linked with health and wealth among both parents and children , while cohabiting couples are more likely to have lower incomes			1
children of married couples are more likely than those with unmarried parents to do well at school and enjoy good health , and to go on to higher education and well - paid jobs			1
@entity44 has promised to introduce more state support for marriage			1
however , the tax break for poorer married parents to be offered this spring has been described by some critics as ‘ ridiculous ’			2
it will mean that 1.6million people who are not higher - rate taxpayers will get only £ 3.85 a week			0
analysts believe that in practice the gain will be even less for more than a million of these people , because for them @entity58 benefit reforms will take away £ 2.50 of the gain			0
the fall in the share of children in married homes comes at a time of growing evidence that marriage is linked with health and wealth ( file picture ) the prime minister and chancellor @entity68 have also declined to shift towards fully transferable income tax allowances which advocates of marriage demand			1
the @entity8 report on families and households 2014 said there were 13.8million dependent children in @entity76 in 2014 , 560,000 more than in 2004			0
the increase is a result of high immigration and high birth rates , pushed up by immigration			0
it said : ‘ the types of families in which dependent children live have changed significantly			0
the biggest change is for dependent children living in opposite sex cohabiting couple families			1
‘ over the same period , the percentage of dependent children living in a married couple family fell by three percentage points to 63 per cent in 2014			1
’ the share of children living with single parents remained at roughly the same level over the decade			2
last year , according to figures from the @entity100 , 23 per cent of dependent children were living with lone parents			2
@entity102 , an author on cohabitation and the family , said : ‘ this is a disastrous direction to be taking			0
it is something that has not been tackled by the government because acting to back marriage is seen as politically incorrect			0
‘ @entity44 is happy to act in favour of same - sex marriage , but he seems not to want to help opposite sex couples raising children			2
’ she added : ‘ marriage is under a cloud , but it is better for parents , children , the national budget , and the welfare of the rest of us			0
’ children of cohabiting parents are more likely than those of married parents to end up in a broken or single - parent family , as cohabitees are between three and four times more likely to break up than married couples .			1
