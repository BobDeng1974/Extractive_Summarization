‘ they have even had some injuries at the linebacker position but replaced some of their starters with good players			0
they have also got some of the premier defensive linemen in the league			0
‘ we are going to have to be solid up front and have good plans to account for where those guys are at and that 's what we 're working on			0
we are at a point on the season where we are going to have to win			1
i feel like we are going to have to start winning this week			2

‘ i 'm a fan and like watching any sport when it is at the highest level			0
i watched @entity80 play the other night ( against @entity81 ) and it was a really exciting game			2
@entity55 are very nice to let us go over there ( to @entity54 ) and make use of their space			0
’ @entity0 has 2,078 passing yards to his name , but the @entity3 are struggling again after a 4 - 12 season last season the @entity3 face a must - win game at @entity4 with their season at a critical point the injury - hit @entity3 made the 4,200 - mile trip to @entity6 on monday , leaving themselves six whole days to acclimate to the new surroundings , foreign country and time difference			1

‘ we are now into our normal routine of what we do during the week			0
guys have settled in and are really excited about the change of venue and to play in front of what we hear is a great crowd			2

‘ i have n't adjusted yet , ’ @entity111 laughed			1
‘ i 'm still hurting			0

’ despite @entity1 struggling at 2 - 5 , they only trail @entity123 leaders the @entity138 by less than two wins			1
@entity121 said : ‘ we are right in the thick of the divisional race			1
it is going to be critical for us to get a win this week and stay in the race			0
it is very bunched and going to go down to the wire			0
‘ we have got to play better football than we have in the last four weeks			0
we have unfortunately had some injuries on our offensive line , but this is part of the @entity150 and you have to deal with it			0
’ and that offensive line will have to find a way of dealing with the @entity5 ’s dominant defense on sunday .			1
