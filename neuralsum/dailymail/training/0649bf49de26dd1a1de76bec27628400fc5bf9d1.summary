@entity0 is investigating an ' unacceptable ' script for the medical students ' society annual play where a character is drugged and raped in a parody of @entity7 movie			1
the script , which mocks the anti-rape slogan ' no means no ' and has characters including mrs @entity11 , @entity12 and head of @entity14 , has caused outrage			1
critics said today the ' misogynistic ' pantomine is ' deeply offensive ' and an ' embarrassment ' because of it makes jokes about sex crimes			0
shame : @entity0 is investigating its medical students , based here in the city , after some produced a pantomime script poking fun at rape it was one of three options written by fourth - year medical students for the annual concert , known as @entity33			1
the event runs every year and involves each year group performing a play based on an existing story , with sexual elements added			2
the script , seen by @entity40 , has five scenes all based around sex and innuendo and is written like a pantomime			1
in the first scene the writers describe how when the ' lights go on all the girls do a gloriously slutty dance in retro slutty clothes ' for the audience			0
in the final act @entity52 ties up dr @entity54 after giving him a @entity57 overdose , ripping off his trousers and raping him as @entity12 watches			0
afterwards all three burst into an explicit version of the classic @entity7 theme @entity63			1
anger : students and other critics have called the script ' embarrassing ' and ' offensive ' disgusted @entity68 wrote on @entity69 : ' what have i just read ? gross below the line comments , rape jokes and general idiocy			1
' a second year psychology student told the @entity0 paper @entity76 : ' not only is it completely humiliating for the medicine school , it just goes to show the true extent of the normalisation of rape culture in @entity81 today			1
' another @entity69 user , @entity83 , called the show ' deeply misogynistic '			0
a social media user , @entity86 , posted : ' regardless of the @entity89 's achievements , this script should not have been written in the first place			2
' it 's absolutely disgusting and so embarrassing on the university 's behalf			0
' students were sent the scripts last month and were asked to vote for their favourite			0
the winning script was a parody of @entity99 , which includes a castration scene and a ' sexy geisha ' dance			2
the medical school is also known for a chant , known as @entity105 , which includes the line ' we like those girls who say they wo n't but look as though they might			0
' the university , the medical students ' society , and the @entity114 , @entity0 's students ' union , released a joint statement condemning the script			1
they said : ' we expect our students to comply with the @entity0 's policy on student conduct and discipline and adhere to appropriate standards of behaviour			1
' @entity127 , the @entity125 and the @entity126 are shocked at the content of this material which is clearly unacceptable			0
' @entity127 and the @entity114 will continue to work together in combating sexism and sexual harassment			0
' the @entity114 also said : ' we believe the material in this document is completely unacceptable and will be working with the @entity0 and the society to investigate and ensure that the content for this performance is suitable			2
' our talk from the founder of the everyday sexism project and the launch of our call it out campaign reinforces our stance on this type of behaviour and our efforts to ensure the university campus is safe and welcoming for all students			0
