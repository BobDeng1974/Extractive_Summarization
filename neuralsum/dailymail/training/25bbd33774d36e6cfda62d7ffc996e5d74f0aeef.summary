by @entity0 a property developer has managed to found a tiny gap in the market on exclusive @entity4 by building two tiny detached houses just 10 inches apart			1
at 16ft wide , the narrow homes have been squeezed onto a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre , and have replaced a single home that stood on the same site			1
despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought - after community in @entity17 , @entity18 , developers have managed to fit three bedrooms , three bathrooms , an open plan kitchen , living room and a basement for storage into each of the 840sq ft properties , which also have their own driveways			1
the properties , named @entity49 , were designed and built by @entity50 , owned by former @entity52 chairman @entity51 , and have gone up for sale with an asking price of £ 745,000 each			1
it is the first time such a narrow pair of properties have been built on a small plot on @entity4 , but they could pave the way for similar developments in the future			2
before : the two three - bedroom homes have been built on this single plot once occupied by a simple bungalow narrow : although the distance between the two is just 25cm they are being marketed as two detached houses in the area , often dubbed @entity44 , or @entity46 's @entity45 , where homes often go for around £ 4million space saving : each of the two properties , which cover 840sq ft , boast an open plan kitchen , storage basement and compact spiral staircases to maximise space located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of @entity78 in @entity18 , @entity4 is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property			1
by area @entity4 and surrounding @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , nicknamed ' @entity46 's @entity45 ' , boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the @entity46 's largest concentration of expensive properties outside @entity90			1
@entity4 's popularity is attributed to its seclusion , and every home in the community is within just a few minutes ' walk of the beach , with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the @entity100			0
houses were first built on @entity4 in the late 19th century , but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built - up , turning into a @entity44 filled with luxury beachfront mansions			1
the property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years , with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting - edge new properties to meet demand			1
in july 2009 a 1,393 - square - metre ( 14,990 sq ft ) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £ 13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £ 10,000 per square metre			1
and earlier this month a bungalow bought for just £ 1,000 almost a century ago ( around £ 40,000 in today 's money ) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £ 5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value			1
last month a tatty 1950s three - bedroom @entity4 bungalow which would be worth just £ 200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye - watering £ 2.25million			2
in march , an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £ 3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down			2
last year , 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £ 80million as @entity4 ' s reputation has continued to grow			2
notable residents include a number of well - known names in football such as @entity142 manager @entity141 , former player and manager @entity144 , @entity146 manager @entity145 and his son @entity147			0
computer magnate sir @entity148 also has a home there			0
mr @entity51 said the houses were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that was n’t a flat			1
' the size of the properties is an illusion , they are both the size of four bedroom family houses , ' he said			0
' we have built the properties up and front to back instead of from side to side and they are quite big and can comfortably take two children and a husband and wife			0
' not everybody wants to live in a large house and that ’s why they choose to live in a flat or a town house			0
' i think this is a new way to look at developments , there are no restrictions when building up , especially when there is a shortage of homes			0
' roomy : despite the homes being smaller in stature than many other homes in the sought - after community , developers have managed to fit three bedrooms , three bathrooms , an open plan kitchen , living room and a basement for storage into them comparison : developer @entity51 said the properties were aimed at people looking to own a holiday home that was n't a flat , and said their size was an ' illusion ' as they are the size of four bedroom family houses the properties have courtyard back gardens , their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout , as well as compact spiral staircases to maximise the living space			1
in 2013 , a property in @entity4 sold for the equivalent of £ 1,725 per square foot but the two new properties work out to a cheaper £ 620 per square foot			2
@entity214 , senior sales consultant at @entity216 and @entity217 estate agents , said : ' these properties are very controversial			0
' even though one is close to the other they are still detached houses and the people looking at them will probably be doing so as an alternative to a flat			0
' in comparison to flats , the houses have their own off road parking and private gardens			0
all mod cons : as well as this luxury bathroom , the properties boast private courtyard back gardens , their own balcony and underfloor heating throughout , plus a driveway providing off road parking striking a bargain ? in 2013 , a property in @entity4 , home to football figures such as @entity141 and @entity145 , sold for the equivalent of £ 1,725 per square foot but the two new properties work out as a cheaper £ 620 per square foot outside space : both of the houses have a private patio garden at the rear , although those needing a little extra outdoor space will not have to walk far to find the nearest beach ' i think they will appeal to people living in @entity90 or the home counties who are looking for a second home			1
' for someone who is looking for a family home , this is probably a bit too small			0
' these are the first properties to be built on small plots of land by mr @entity51 , but i know that he has plans for several more across the area			2
' over the last two decades @entity4 , overlooking @entity78 , has become a millionaire ’s playground with dozens of luxury beachfront mansions			0
the sandy peninsula is home to @entity146 manager @entity145 and @entity142 manager @entity272 manager @entity144 , @entity146 manager @entity145 and his son @entity147			0
computer magnate sir @entity148 also has a home there .			0

the two homes were built on the site of a single property on the sought - after peninsula in @entity17 , @entity18
houses , nicknamed @entity49 , have gone up for sale with an asking price of £ 745,000 each
properties boast an open plan kitchen , storage basement and compact spiral staircases to maximise space
developer says they would be ideal for families wanting a holiday home in the area , where homes often cost £ 4m
