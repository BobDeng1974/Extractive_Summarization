by @entity0 published : 12:30 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 12:37 est , 10 july 2013 @entity3 's next @entity2 rover has been given a mission to find signs of past life and to collect and store rock from the the red planet that will one day be sent back to @entity9			1
it will demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet and look for signs of life			0
the space agency has revealed what the rover , known as @entity2 2020 , will look like			1
@entity2 2020 will also demonstrate technology for a human exploration of the planet it will share the body of @entity3 's @entity28 , which is currently searching for life on @entity2 and beginning the journey to its final destination			1
the new rover will use the same landing system as @entity28 , which used a ground - breaking chassis and ' sky crane ' to arrive on @entity2 in one piece			1
it will also use some of the current robot 's spare parts to save time on the new design as well as money			0
@entity2 2020 is estimated to cost a princely $ 1.5 billion - one billion less than its predecessor @entity28			1
the new design , which will collect rock samples , marks the next major step in fulfilling president @entity48 's challenge of sending humans to @entity2 in the 2030s			1
@entity51 , @entity3 's associate administrator for science in @entity53 , said : ' crafting the science and exploration goals is a crucial milestone in preparing for our next major @entity2 mission			2
' the 2020 mission plans on building on the accomplishments of @entity28 and other @entity2 missions			2
the @entity64 rovers , along with several orbiters , found evidence @entity2 has a watery history			0
curiosity recently confirmed that past environmental conditions on @entity2 could have supported living microbes			0
according to the @entity72 , looking for signs of past life is the next logical step			0
the rover will use its instruments for visual , mineralogical and chemical analysis down to microscopic scale to understand the environment around its landing site			0
it will also identify biosignatures or features in the rocks and soil that could have been formed biologically			0
@entity85 , chairman of the @entity72 and a professor of geological sciences at @entity88 in @entity89 , said : ' the @entity2 2020 mission concept does not presume that life ever existed on @entity2			1
' ' however , given the recent curiosity findings , past @entity2 life seems possible and we should begin the difficult endeavor of seeking the signs of life			2
' no matter what we learn , we would make significant progress in understanding the circumstances of early life existing on @entity9 and the possibilities of extraterrestrial life			2
' there are plans for the next rover to collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and soil with the intention of a later mission picking them up bringing them back to @entity9 for more definitive analysis in laboratories			2
in a bid to save time and money , the @entity2 2020 rover will share the body of @entity3 's @entity28 ( a model is pictured ) which is currently searching for life on @entity2 and beginning the journey to its final destination			1
the new rover will use the same landing system as @entity28 , which used a ground - breaking chassis and ' sky crane ' to arrive on @entity2 in one piece the science conducted by the rover 's instruments aims to expand our knowledge of @entity2 and provide the context needed to make wise decisions about whether to return the samples to @entity9			1
@entity138 , director of @entity3 's @entity139 in @entity53 , said : ' the @entity2 2020 mission will provide a unique capability to address the major questions of habitability and life in the solar system			1
' ' this mission represents a major step towards creating high - value sampling and interrogation methods , as part of a broader strategy for sample returns by planetary missions			0
' samples collected and analyzed by the rover will help inform future human exploration missions to @entity2			0
the rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a human expedition understand any hazards posed by @entity2 dust and demonstrate how to collect carbon dioxide , which could be a resource for making oxygen and rocket fuel			0
improved precision landing technology that enhances the scientific value of robotic missions also will be critical for eventual human exploration on the surface , @entity3 said .			0

@entity2 2020 will collect up to 31 rock and soil samples from the red planet and will look for signs of extraterrestrial life
the new rover will use the same landing system as @entity28 and share its frame , which has saved @entity3 $ 1 billion
the mission will bring the sapec agency a step *closer* to meeting president @entity48 's challenge to send humans to @entity2 in the next decade
