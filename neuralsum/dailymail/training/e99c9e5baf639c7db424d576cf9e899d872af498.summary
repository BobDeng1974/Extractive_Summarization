by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 27 march 2012 updated : 09:32 est , 27 march 2012 two huge new planets spotted by a telescopes in @entity3 are the oldest planets detected outside our solar system - and have been there since before the @entity7 was fully formed			1
dr @entity8 , whose team found the planets orbiting the star @entity12 said : ' if there was once intelligent civilisation there , it would have watched how the @entity16 started expanding after the @entity17 and how galaxies and the first stars formed			1
' the planets are thought to be three times as old as @entity22 , and were formed 12.8 billion years ago			1
a @entity24 - like extrasolar planet : one planet is the size of @entity24 , the other three times bigger			1
both are thought to be three times as old as @entity22 , and were formed 12.8 billion years ago they are just 375 light years away from our solar system			1
they were detected using ' radial velocity ' , where astronomers watch for ' wobbles ' in starlight , caused by the pull of orbiting worlds			0
one planet is thought to be as massive as @entity24 in our solar system			0
the other is roughly three times the size of @entity24			2
if there is life , there , it 's liable to be very different from human beings			0
planet formation was not thought to be possible in the early universe , when stars were ' metal poor ' - lacking elements heavier than hydrogen and helium			2
@entity8 says , ' it 's iron abundance is only about one per cent that of our sun. i wonder what kind of ' blood ' they have without iron element â€“ at the time , there were almost no heavy elements available			0
' the new planets were detected by the @entity65 at @entity66 , @entity3 , @entity67 it had been thought that it was impossible for planets to form without these heavier elements			0
@entity8 acknowledges that the planets could have formed later in the life cycle of the star - but says this is unlikely			1
usually planets form just shortly after the star formation , ' he said			0
' second - generation planets might also form after a star has died , but this is still under debate			2

two planets are 12.8 billion years old - three times older than @entity22
' if there is civilisation there , it will have seen the @entity16 expanding after the @entity17 ' - *scientist*
