by @entity0 published : 06:48 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 11:34 est , 6 september 2012 just days after @entity2 was forced into a humiliating u-turn after falsely claiming that he once ran a marathon in under three hours , questions are now being asked about the vice-presidential candidate 's claim to be a prolific mountain climber			1
@entity9 's running mate told his hometown newspaper that he had scaled ' close to 40 ' of @entity14 's 54 ' fourteeners ' mountains , each of which is at least 14,000ft tall			1
although mr @entity2 made this claim three years ago , it is now under scrutiny after he admitted on saturday that he has n't run a marathon in under three hours , as he had boasted last month on a radio show broadcast across the @entity22 exaggerating ? @entity2 , pictured on the campaign trail in @entity24 , @entity25 , yesterday , claimed he has scaled ' close to 40 ' of @entity14 's ' fourteeners ' range of 54 peaks popular with climbers : @entity14 's ' fourteeners ' mountain range contains 54 peaks which are all at least 14,000ft tall the conservative @entity34 congressman was forced to admit that he misstated his time by more than an hour			1
it turns out he actually took more than four hours to finish the marathon and not under three , as he had said			2
now experienced climbers are pouring doubt on mr @entity2 's mountain claims , reports @entity41			1
one expert at climbing website @entity44 said : ' to have climbed 40 and not be a resident [ in @entity14 ] means that you would have had to devote entire summers to climbing fourteeners , in essence becoming a ' lifestyle ' hiker / scrambler			1
' i doubt @entity2 had the time or dedication to fourteeners to take the required time out from his political career			1
' even if you did four a summer , that would be ten summers devoted to travelling to @entity14 for the purpose of high altitude hiking			2
even if you live here and can drive to the trail heads , forty is a huge commitment of time and energy			0
' athletic : the scepticism comes days after mr @entity2 admitted he actually ran a marathon in over four hours and not in under three , as he claimed last month the climber added : ' why does it matter that @entity2 - as seems likely in light of his marathon fabrication - is not a ' mountain man ' and is lying about his fourteener record ? ' because there is no better index of character			1
it tells of someone 's desperation to connect to the voters of a swing state , his ability to make stuff up without conscience , and ruthless ambition to obtain power through any means			0
' it also indicates his contempt for the citizens of @entity14			2
he apparently believes that @entity14 voters are clueless and that the press is a lapdog that has lost any ability to check facts			2
' dedicated hikers , scramblers , climbers , hunters , fishermen and other aficionados of the @entity14 high peaks do not need to exaggerate their visceral connection to the @entity14 high country and need not apply to become a faux mountain man , like @entity2			1
' ] mr @entity2 admitted his actual marathon time after @entity109 unearthed evidence he had completed a single marathon in 1990 , and finished in just over four hours			1
that time stands in stark contrast to what he had previously said , when he proudly bragged to radio host @entity115 that he had run a ' two hour and fifty - something ' marathon			0
that would make for a pace of less than seven minutes per mile for the 26.2 mile course - a blazing speed for recreational runners			0
' under three , high twos			0
i had a two hour and fifty - something , ' mr @entity2 reportedly told mr @entity115 , to which the shocked radio - man expressed reportedly exclaimed , ' holy smokes			2
' ' i was fast when i was younger , yeah , ' @entity9 's running mate quipped in reply			0
the @entity2 campaign told @entity109 that the @entity132 ran one marathon in 1990 when he was 20 years old			1
that was the @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity137			0
the running magazine reports he finished in four hours , one minute , and 25 seconds			0
it turns out @entity2 is slower than @entity140 , but faster than @entity141			0
in the running : @entity144 vice president nominee with presidential nominee @entity9 on the campaign trail working the room : @entity144 vice presidential candidate @entity2 shaking hands and high fiving supporters mrs @entity140 reportedly has a best time of 3:59 ; @entity150 has run 3:30 ; @entity151 has run 3:44 ; while mr @entity141 trails the vice presidential bunch with a 4:58			2
a spokesman for the @entity9 / @entity2 campaign contacted @entity41 to defend the vice-presidential candidate 's comments on his experience of climbing in @entity14			1
@entity158 said : ' we 're not sure where this started , but he 's not said 40 different peaks , it 's nearly 40 climbs - with a number of peaks climbed more than once			1
' he 's been doing them for more than 20 years			0
the @entity169 article from 2009 does n't say 40 separate summits , but instead : ' he is fairly careful about what he eats , performs an intense cross-training routine known as @entity174 most mornings , and has made close to 40 climbs of @entity14 's fourteeners			1
' a ' fourteener ' is a term unique to mountaineers in the @entity22 it refers to a mountain peak that is more than 14,000ft above sea level , of which there are 53 in @entity14 , known as the @entity185			2
the tallest is @entity186 , which is part of the @entity188 and stands at 14,440ft tall			0
in 53rd place is @entity190 , which is part of the @entity193 range and is 14,009ft tall			0
other popular fourteeners include the 14,110ft tall @entity195 , which inspired the poem ' @entity198 ' and 14,255ft tall @entity197 , which resides inside @entity199			0
@entity14 is extremely popular with climbers and attracts tens of thousands of skiiers each winter .			0

vice-presidential candidate claims he has scaled ' close to 40 ' of @entity14 's ' fourteeners ' range of 54 peaks , each of which is more than 14,000ft tall
@entity2 's spokesman tried to *clarify* his comments , saying he did not climb 40 separate peaks , but has climbed some more than once
@entity2 has already been forced to admit previous claim that he ran marathon in under three hours was exaggerated by more than an hour
