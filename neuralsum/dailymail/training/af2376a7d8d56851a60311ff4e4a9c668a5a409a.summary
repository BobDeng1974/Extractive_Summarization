by @entity0 this week @entity2 presenter @entity1 is taking on the task of scaling a 1,200ft high mountain in @entity5			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 is infamous in climbing circles for its difficulty			1
it will take @entity1 two - and - a - half days to ascend and at night she must ( attempt to ) sleep dangled from the sandstone rock face in a mini tent			1
she wo n't be able to wash , go to the toilet without tubing or rest for long on the gruelling climb which challenges even the most advanced climbers			2
toppled by nature : @entity1 stands in front of a coconut tree which hangs in the twisted steel roof of a school destroyed by the typhoon still smiling : @entity1 meets children who survived the tropical cyclone last year devastation : @entity1 looks at a ruined building that was once a school lives destroyed in an instant : homes and businesses were wiped out by the natural disaster @entity1 , 36 , admits she 'd only climbed a ladder , and maybe a tree as a child , before taking on this ordeal			1
so just what made her agree to take on the arduous climb ? she was inspired following a trip earlier this year to the @entity46 to see how money raised by @entity48 is helping people whose lives were destroyed by @entity51			1
the tropical cyclone killed thousands of people and left many survivors homeless after it tore through @entity55 last november			1
@entity1 travelled to @entity56 , the @entity46 city worst hit by the typhoon , to witness the destruction first hand			2
homeless : @entity1 with @entity61 and her daughters outside of the cramped structure in which they have been living since their homes we swept away rebuilding : the presenter helped with a project to create new homes silver lining : the wood from coconut tress felled by the natural disaster can be used to make new homes where the money goes : the building is made possible thanks to support from charities she told @entity78 : ' amongst all the devastation and destruction that the @entity51 left in its wake , perhaps the most visually striking is the coconut trees which were felled			1
' as we arrived the number of these giant trees which had been ripped from the ground by the combined force of the wind and storm surge wave that fateful day in november began to hit home			2
' a nearby school roof had been crushed by an 80 foot tree which was still suspended there			2
other classrooms looked like a bomb site - even reinforced concrete walls had been ripped apart			1
' while @entity1 was shocked by the devastation but was further alarmed when she learnt of the human suffering the typhoon caused			0
many farmed had replied on the uprooted trees for a living so now had no source of income			1
getting stuck in : @entity1 was happy to help with the house building new start : @entity61 and her family will be able to move into a more comfortable wooden home other families had their entire lives wiped out by the force of nature			0
@entity1 explains : ' i was introduced to @entity61 and her two beautiful daughters , @entity115 , 14 , and @entity116 , 10			0
the typhoon hit almost a year to the day after @entity61 had lost her husband to illness and their house did n't stand a chance â € “ washed away , along with everything they owned , in an instant			0
an entire lifetime 's worth of possessions , care and love just gone			0
' she added : ' since then the family have lived in a makeshift tent - cum - shack cobbled together with corrugated iron sheets they found strewn around			1
' inside , conditions are indescribably awful			0
supplies they have managed to get from the relief effort take up most of the meagre space and the three of them are forced to sleep curled up in a ball			0
' but thanks to the way @entity48 is helping aid agencies like @entity147 and @entity148 , @entity61 and her family have now been given a new home that @entity1 helped to build			1
she said : ' the only positive to be gleaned from the 30million trees that were damaged or destroyed was that , with so many homes obliterated too , these fallen giants provide a ready supply of lumber for the rebuilding programme			2
' challenging climb : @entity1 is currently in @entity5 and begins her ascent today after a few practise runs , right precarious : at night , @entity1 will sleep in this suspended bed @entity61 's new home was created using freshly cut timber from one of the uprooted trees			1
@entity1 picked up a hammer and attempted to make herself useful where she could but left the majority of the work to the experts			2
she said it was heartwarming to see how much the new structure meant to @entity61 and her daughters			0
' as their new home began to take shape the excitement and emotion on @entity61 and her girl 's faces was plain to see and as soon as the roof was on they began to move what possessions they had in , ' she said			0
' to see the transformation in a single day was astonishing			0
life wo n't be easy for @entity61 and her family of course , and in time they will need a more permanent , stronger home than this , but compared to where they had spent their lives since the typhoon it was heaven and the joy they felt as they moved in was written all over their faces			0
' after seeing how money donated to charity has made such a difference , @entity1 is now determined to raise as much money as she can through her mountain challenge			2
she said she 'll keep the plight of those like @entity61 was in mind when the going gets tough			0
she said : ' it 's sometimes easy to wonder if the money given in the wake of huge natural disasters like @entity51 ends up where you want it to			0
it does n't get more tangible or useful than what i witnessed through chainsaws , nails , wood and expertise coming together to make the world of difference			0
' the trouble is that there are plenty more families waiting for that kind of miracle to happen to them , which is why i 've chosen to dangle from the edge of a rock face - hope my climbing skills are a bit better than my diy ones ! ' @entity1 at www.sportrelief.com/alex and follow her progress on @entity2 from 17 march , 7pm , @entity240 .			1
