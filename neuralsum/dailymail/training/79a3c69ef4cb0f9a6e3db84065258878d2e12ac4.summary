some of the 61 bodies were discovered around @entity13 - home to many of the city 's gay bars and restaurants and known as the ' @entity18 '			1
' canals are not popular suicide spots , especially for men			0
they are , however , popular dumping sites			0
and water can be a sure way to erase dna evidence			0
' @entity43 strangler @entity42 dumped some of his prostitute victims in water so any traces of him would be washed away			0
' however @entity48 has dismissed his claims about a serial killer being on the loose and insist that each individual case is investigated thoroughly			1
a spokesman from the force said : ' @entity48 is committed to thoroughly investigating each and every unexplained death in @entity3 and approach each one as potentially suspicious in its initial stages			2
some of the bodies had been found in waterways by @entity13 - the @entity18 of the city ' only after a robust investigation into the circumstances of each death would investigators deem one to be ' non-suspicious ' and pass the file to the coroner			1
' the coroner 's post mortem would then ascertain the cause of death , which would then be recorded accordingly by the investigating officer			2
' none of our investigations are carried out in isolation and as we have said publicly before , we have established no link between the various incidents recorded			0
the death of 22 - year - old @entity20 , from @entity79 in @entity80 , was one of the examples cited by professor @entity6			1
mr @entity20 was found dead in the @entity21 ten days after going missing from a @entity23 concert in @entity85 in june 2012			2
he had become separated from his friends following the gig , sparking a massive manhunt across the region			0
at an inquest into his death , deputy coroner @entity90 recorded an open verdict and admitted she simply could not say how he had ended up in the water			2
in another death , the body of @entity97 student @entity96 , 18 , was found in the @entity26			1
the discovery was made three weeks after he was told to leave a @entity101 at the @entity103 dance night in @entity104			0
he had been seen walking away from the venue with a mystery man and @entity108 footage shows only one of the two men returning to the nightclub			0
