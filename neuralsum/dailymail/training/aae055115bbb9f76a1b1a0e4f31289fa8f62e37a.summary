television weatherman @entity1 used his ' boundless energy ' and ' extrovert personality ' to help gain the affection and trust of five schoolboys he sexually abused , a jury has heard			1
@entity1 , 65 , is said to have indecently assaulted his victims between the late 1960s and the early 1980s during his former career as a teacher			1
four of the complainants were teenage pupils at @entity13 , where @entity1 taught biology			2
tv weatherman @entity1 ( pictured arriving at court on tuesday ) used his ' boundless energy ' and ' extrovert personality ' to help gain the affection and trust of five schoolboys he sexually abused , a jury has heard opening the case at @entity22 , prosecutor @entity20 said : ' the very qualities that made @entity1 so successful as a tv celebrity - his boundless energy , his infectious enthusiasm , his extrovert personality - helped him gain , we say , the trust of these boys			1
' trust , which the prosecution say , mr @entity1 repeatedly abused when , away from their parents on school trips organised by mr @entity1 , he sexually assaulted each of them			1
' we say that when it came to teenage boys in his care , @entity1 was something of a ' chancer '			1
' one of these men who regularly and repeatedly tries it on with his intended victim as often as he can in the hope that his sexual advances will not be rejected			0
' or , at the very least , the sexual advances will be met by a passive response due to confusion , fear , intoxication or youthful inexperience of how to react when being placed in such an unusual , shocking and , no doubt on occasion , frightening position			0
' and we say that like many child abusers who are in a position of authority who are confident and who are plainly well liked by their peers , he gambled that each of the boys he took advantage of would find it impossible to speak out and tell other adults what he had done , either through fear of not being believed or because it would inevitably involve speaking to parents or other teachers about embarrassing matters of a sexual , indeed homosexual , nature			0
' @entity1 , of @entity76 , @entity77 , who was a regular on the floating weather map in @entity80 's @entity79 for @entity81 's top - rating this morning show , denies 10 counts of indecent assault			1
the jury of nine women and three men were told that many if not all of them would know the defendant as ' @entity91 '			0
he had appeared on local and national television since the mid- 1980s until recently , and has appeared in various other @entity81 programmes , the court heard			1
a prosecuting lawyer said ' the qualities that made @entity1 successful as a tv celebrity - his boundless energy - helped him gain the boys ' trust '			1
the accused is pictured while presenting on @entity81 's @entity101 outlining the allegations , mr @entity20 said they centred around two distinct periods of time - firstly when @entity1 was a trainee teacher in @entity105 in the late 1960s and early 1970s and secondly from the mid- 70s to 1984 when @entity1 taught in @entity106			1
the prosecutor said @entity1 says nothing sexual or even inappropriate occurred between himself and the @entity106 pupils , while he states that sexual activity with the complainant during his teacher training only happened when the boy turned 16			1
the latter complainant said he first met @entity115 when he visited his school in @entity117 and was someone who came from a very poor background and had limited life experiences			0
mr @entity20 said : ' meeting mr @entity1 meant he was able to go places and do things and meet people he would never have been able to had the defendant not taken him under his wing			0
' within weeks , the boy was invited to visit @entity1 at his accommodation and it later led to the pair sharing a bed with @entity1 ' pushing and manoeuvring himself against him ' in a sexual manner , he said			1
it was the boy 's first sexual experience , added mr @entity20 , which left him very confused			0
there were more overnight visits @entity1 ' gained in confidence and stepped up his sexual advances ' , said the prosecutor			1
the court heard that the complainant is clear that the defendant never forced himself upon him but described @entity1 coaxing him into letting perform sexual acts on him			1
on one occasion he recalled , when still aged 15 , he went to a ball at @entity1 's teacher training college with a girl and later the defendant unzipped this trousers and performed oral sex on him outside			1
the next complainant claimed he was sexually assaulted by @entity115 in the mid- 1970s on a barge during a canal trip organised by @entity154			0
he said @entity1 was the teacher in charge and each night one of the schoolboys had to sleep in a double bed with him as there were not enough bunk beds for everyone			1
@entity1 sexually assaulted him in the bed , he alleges			0
mr @entity20 said the teenager was one of a number of former pupils who described how @entity1 managed to gain their trust and affection			1
@entity1 ( left ) , of @entity76 , @entity169 denied 10 counts of indecent assault he said : ' he said that he was good at befriending you , making you feel like he was your mate , a friend more than a teacher			1
an approach the prosecution says was quite deliberate on the part of mr @entity1 , given his objective of gaining the trust of these boys			1
' the third complainant said he too was indecently assaulted in the mid- 1970s by @entity115 in his double bed on the barge during a weekend canal trip			0
he said he was drunk after @entity1 took older boys to the pub and later brought beer back to the boat			2
mr @entity20 said : ' he recalls mr @entity1 suggesting that some of the boys pretend to be girls so that they could , as he put it , have an " orgy " which had to be kept secret			2
he recalls the boys and mr @entity1 all taking their clothes off and rolling around			2
' the jury heard that this complainant previously contacted police in 1992 , 1996 and 1998 to say that @entity1 had sexually abused him but the defendant denied the allegations and police decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute			2
the alleged victim admitted that when he went back to the police in 1996 , he exaggerated the events of the sexual abuse in frustration at the case not going forward , mr @entity20 said			1
the fourth complainant said he was drinking in a pub local to @entity1 when he and some of his friends were invited back to the defendant 's home			2
the then - 16 - year - old said he went to the toilet and @entity1 came up behind him and said ' i can do that for you ' and grabbed hold of his penis			0
mr @entity20 said this was yet another example of the defendant ' trying it on ' with a teenage boy to whom he was plainly sexually attracted			0
the final complainant said he too was aged 16 when he and a friend went to a party at @entity1 's home in @entity76			2
he recalled that they knocked on the door and @entity1 greeted them completely naked			0
@entity1 went on to get dressed and during the evening indecently assaulted the youngster in his living room while the pair were alone , the court heard			1
the court heard that @entity1 's teaching career came to ' an abrupt end ' in 1984 following an incident involving a pupil at his home			1
@entity1 , who also taught astronomy , had invited a number of boys to stay over as ' there was a particular alignment of planets expected on that night and the defendant had a telescope at home '			2
one of the boys said during the evening he was propositioned by @entity115 who asked him if he could perform a sex act on him , said the prosecutor			0
the youngster politely declined and said there was nothing he could do that his girlfriend could not do for him			0
@entity1 is then said to have remarked : ' i think you 'll find i can			0
' he also told the youngster and another boy who were intending to stay the night to ' make sure you leave room for me in the middle '			0
the boy told his father who rang the defendant to complain , said mr @entity20			0
the prosecutor said @entity1 offered to discuss the matter but before he had the opportunity the school 's headteacher informed the boy 's father that @entity1 would not be coming round and had resigned with immediate affect			2
a diary entry written by @entity1 , said to be in relation to the above incident , said : ' as usual i had quite a bit to drink , as usual i tried			0
' mr @entity20 said the defendant was out of work following his sudden departure from school and his career in television took off some time later			0
the police investigation into @entity1 in 2012 came following publicity into an unrelated sex abuse probe at @entity295 , another school in the @entity106 area			2
a woman rang detectives to say a friend of hers had been sexually abused by @entity1 as a pupil , which led to police locating one of the complainants who told them he was indeed a victim			0
police went on track down the alleged victim who had made three complaints previously about the defendant , while the others came forward as a result of publicity of @entity1 's arrest			2
the prosecutor said @entity1 offered ' no comment ' when he was spoken to by police and formally interviewed under caution			0
@entity1 , of @entity76 , @entity319 , who was a regular on the floating weather map in @entity80 's @entity79 for @entity81 's top - rating this morning show , denies 10 counts of indecent assault			1
