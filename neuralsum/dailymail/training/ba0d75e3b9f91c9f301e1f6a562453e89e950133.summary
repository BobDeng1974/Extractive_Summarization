she has detailed her experiences in a blog @entity0 started out in the property industry almost 40 years ago , when everyday sexism was the norm			1
in the last four decades she has risen through the ranks to become associate director at the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) and says the workplace is almost unrecognisable			1
she wrote about her experiences in a blog for the @entity11 , detailed here : ' when i first started in the property business almost 40 years ago , things were very different for women			1
' the whole workplace was very different ; behaviours that are today a sackable offence were treated as the norm			0
' when i first decided i would like a job in an estate agency , a ‘ secretary ’ post seemed to be the only place i could start			1
these days i would be called a sales administrator , though the job is very much the same			2
' everyday sexism was the norm : i remember one day a male property surveyor ( as they all were back then ) whom i had never met before , came into the office , sat down in front of me , put his feet on my desk and , without so much as a hello , said ‘ mine is a coffee , black no sugar ’ ! ' it was not a bad firm but in those days you just accepted that as a woman you were there to support the men			1
' you put up with having your bottom pinched or being groped at the office party and there was no point in taking umbrage if you wanted to keep your job			1
' it soon became apparent to the boss that my typing was appalling , so i was made a junior estate agent but that was as far as my promotion prospects went			0
' i stayed with that particular firm , a good old fashioned partnership , for a couple of years , during which time a number of the male junior negotiators were promoted			2
' i was told women did n’t need proper jobs as they could rely on their husbands – and i had children so it would be too risky to promote me			0
' i therefore decided i had to be better - qualified than the men if i was to be taken seriously in the business , and obtained a place on a property course			2
' three years later i graduated			2
' at that time , the most family friendly place to gain professional experience was in the public sector , so i applied			0
a meeting of female property surveyors in @entity79 in the late seventies ' getting an interview was difficult - there was one organisation where i was turned down because they thought i would have trouble ‘ combining work with my family commitments ’			1
' my final interview was with the @entity88 , where i was offered a graduate post			0
' even then there was some wage discrimination : a fellow male graduate , with the same degree , age and estate agency experience was offered a similar graduate position , but with a higher starting salary			1
' the office i started in had never had a female property valuer before and when i first arrived there was a big debate as to whether i should be excused from the ladies ’ tea rota			1
' fortunately the boss put his foot down and said i had better things to do than make tea			2
' inappropriate behaviour was common - in one office there was a colleague who was an out and out lech who thought nothing of ‘ rubbing past ’ as you stood at the photocopier ; sometimes groping you at the same time			2
' digging him in the ribs or getting annoyed only seemed to increase the pleasure it gave him , so you just avoided being cornered by him			0
' another colleague was also rather ‘ hands on ’ but not at all in the same way - he would always put his arm around females when explaining things to them			2
' he was mortified when i told him that being ‘ hands on ’ made women uncomfortable , i genuinely believe he did n’t realise how he made us feel or even that he was doing it			0
in the sixties and seventies , women were often touched inappropriately by men in the workplace ( picture posed by models ) ' when i went to value property , some members of the public would say to my face that they ‘ were expecting a man ’ and look concerned as i got on with the job			1
' it was not all bad			0
dealing a lot of the time with inheritance tax , i used to particularly like negotiating with the gentlemanly land agents who treated me like a lady			0
' i had some easy negotiations and think with hindsight they may have been slightly charmed dealing with a woman			0
sexism can be double - edged			0
' the women ’s world of work has changed exponentially for the better over the last 40 years			1
' however , i do n’t think you can judge history against the standards of today ; i just look back on it as if i was involved in a period drama , or maybe a comedy			0
