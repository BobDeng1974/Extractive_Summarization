by @entity0 paranormal investigators say they have proof that a @entity4 aircraft carrier is haunted			0
the @entity6 ghostbusters , who call themselves the ' @entity8 ' , recorded a 12 - minute video of their investigation last month aboard the @entity11 , birthed in @entity12 , @entity6			1
the video appears to show spirit voices communicating with them and at one point telling them ' we are under attack ' and to ' get off the ship '			1
the clip goes on to offer ' proof ' of the group 's paranormal findings the ship 's decks are explored by flashlight as the group retells ghost stories and puts questions to the spirits who are said to reside aboard the vessel on which 300 people died over the years the group spends a large portion of the film sat in the ship 's briefing room where they announce to any listening spirits : ' we are not here to disrespect anyone or anything on this ship ' @entity11 ( @entity11 ) the eighth ship to bear the name cost : $ 69 million length : 856 feet draft : 27 feet flight deck width : 120 feet propulsion : 150,000 horsepower			1
displacement : 27,000 tons @entity57 ( @entity58 ) 1,420 aircraft destroyed 42 cargo ships sunk 10 destroyers sunk 1 cruiser sunk 1 carrier sunk 1 assist on super battle ship @entity64 in one scene they say that an audible tapping sound is @entity69 , translated to read ' hi , @entity70 ' , which they suggest is a message from the @entity70 technicians who used to work aboard the ship on which more than 300 people died			1
the group from @entity77 visited the ship last month on its 70th anniversary last month and toured it in darkness , with the aid of torches			0
the ship , no longer in service , saw action in @entity86 and the @entity88 manned space mission			0
introducing the investigation , researcher @entity21 said the @entity11 ' is responsible for destroying 1,400 enemy planes , sinking one million tonnes of enemy ships and more suicides onboard than any other ship in the @entity4			0
' equipped with digital recording equipment , static cameras and their ' spirit box , ' which scans through radio frequencies , the group of four 20 - somethings patrol the ship 's decks in darkness , relaying ghost stories and stopping to ask questions to ' the spirits '			1
@entity107 , the lead investigator can be heard asking the question : ' are you happy to see women aboard ? ' to which comes the faint reply picked up on the camera 's microphone : ' it 's good			1
' the ship 's museum looks decidedly spooky in the video clip a tapping sound that can be heard in the film is said by the group to be attempts by spirit @entity69 workers who used to work onboard , to make contact			1
the tapping sound is translated and said to read : ' hi i.t @entity130 , the group 's audio / visual specialist and keen @entity129 musician seen here with his voice recorder , asks the spirits : who am i ? a voice can be heard responding : ' you are @entity130 '			2
just as well someone is on the ball ! @entity140 , a chef by trade , works as the group 's technician , and can be seen here listening and looking out for paranormal activity onboard the ship a static camera is placed on the steps seen here			0
the group is convinced that the camera 's microphone picks up the sound of movement , despite nothing appearing to pass up or down the same voice can be heard saying the words : ' @entity4 ' , in response to @entity107 asking what the name of the ship is , before appearing to say the words ' comfortable ' and ' @entity160			2
' later she can be seen sitting down , convinced she has been touched by a spirit			2
she says she feels ' cold and tingly ' and asks : ' are you touching me right now '			0
although physical contact is not confirmed , the camera 's microphone appears to pick up the response : ' get out			0
' @entity130 looks surprised when he hears his name in response to his question : who am i ? it 's a pity the @entity175 are not as hot on @entity176 as they are on the heels of ghosts			1
' your ' should read ' you 're ' @entity107 was convinced she 'd been touched by a spirit in the film			1
she said she felt ' tingly and cold ' as well as being ' touched ' , she also appears to be given her marching orders as a voice can be heard saying ' @entity184 ' despite her invitation to the spirits to come out and tell them their stories when @entity130 , the group 's audio visual specialist and part - time @entity129 artist asks ' who am i ? ' a voice can be heard responding : ' you are @entity130			2
' @entity130 also places a a static camera on the ship 's stairs and is convinced it recorded the sound of movement			0
the group believes spirits communicate using white noise and by manipulating transmissions and investigate paranormal activities in various locations following tip offs from members of the public			2
their catchline is : ' if you do n't believe it , join us on our hunts , see things you 've never seen before '			0
meet the team : @entity107 and @entity21 are the two female investigators as @entity175 @entity140 and @entity130 complete the fearless foursome			1
as a group they invite the public to tip them off about suspected ghost haunts so that they can turn up and investigate			0
