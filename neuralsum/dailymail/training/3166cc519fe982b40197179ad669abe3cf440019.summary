pieces of debris from the @entity3 spaceship that broke apart mid-flight have been found 35 miles from the main crash site			1
@entity8 ( @entity7 ) chairman @entity6 said investigators had recovered parts small enough to have been blown that distance by the wind			1
the main wreckage from friday 's crash that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five - mile area in the @entity18 in @entity19			1
tiny pieces of debris from the spaceship were found 35 miles away federal accident investigators have an early sense of what went wrong on @entity24 , but they still do not know why the craft prematurely shifted its shape prior to the deadly crash			1
mr @entity6 said cockpit video and data showed the co-pilot unlocked @entity24 's unique ' feathering ' system earlier than planned			1
the system works somewhat like the wing flaps airplanes use to slow for landing — except that @entity24 's entire twin tails rotate up at a far more extreme angle , to a position that creates strong resistance and slows the descent			1
authorities say the co-pilot unlocked the system before planned , but this was one of two steps necessary to change the craft 's configuration and was not enough on its own to do so			1
the main wreckage from the crash on friday that killed one pilot and injured another is spread over a five - mile area in the @entity18 in @entity19 activating the feathering system requires the pulling of a lever , not unlike a gun that fires only when the trigger is pulled , not just because the safety has been disengaged			1
but unlocking the system may have set off a chain of events that led to disintegration of the craft			1
@entity7 spokesman @entity69 said monday investigators believe once the feathers were unlocked , ' aerodynamic forces ' buffeting the craft as it hurtled along about 760 mph caused the feathers to start rotating			2
within a few seconds , the craft began to disintegrate , @entity7 investigators determined			0
@entity24 is carried aloft on the underside of a jet - powered mother ship			1
it then drops from that ship and fires its own rocket to head higher			0
these images show the @entity24 rocket separating from the carrier aircraft , left , and then disintegrating , right , during a test flight on friday the feathers are not supposed to engage until the craft reaches a speed of @entity89 , or more than 1,000 mph , mr @entity6 told reporters			1
mr @entity69 stressed that a final cause will take months to determine , and that investigators were looking into other factors , including pilot training , mechanical failure and design flaws			2
passenger jets typically fly about seven miles high			2
@entity3 envisions flights with six passengers climbing to more than 62 miles above @entity100			2
seats sell for $ 250,000 and the company says it has booked passengers including @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
the ultimate goal of @entity3 co-owner @entity108 is to create an industry that can move people around the globe in a fraction of the current time it takes passenger jets , by rocketing them into space and back down			0
but the company now lacks not only a craft to fly , but also an understanding of what caused the crash			0
@entity122 ( left ) was killed in the crash on friday , while co-pilot @entity124 ( right ) survived though rival companies also are pushing ahead , the dawn of space tourism seems to have been pushed beyond the horizon yet again			0
@entity24 has been under development for years , and @entity108 originally predicted passengers would be enjoying the wonders of flight by now			2
in the weeks before the crash , he said he hoped to fly in 2015			0
@entity108 still plans to be on the maiden voyage , with his family			0
he said that day will not come before a new round of crew - only flights			2
' we need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested — and that it will be , ' he said			0
' and once it 's thoroughly tested , and we can go to space , we will go to space			0
' the largest piece of wreckage is a wing but tiny bits of debris have been found 35 miles from the main site friday 's crash could trigger increased government regulation			1
to give the fledgling commercial space industry space to innovate , the @entity152 has not overregulated test flights during the past decade , according to @entity155 , an assistant professor at @entity156 who specializes in space law			0
but the crash could allow the @entity152 to propose new rules that would affect future @entity3 flights , and ' it will be very interesting to see how @entity162 and the @entity152 and industry respond , ' @entity158 said			0
the @entity152 did not immediately comment monday			0
the agency is able to initiate a rule - making process that would affect the design or operation of a spacecraft involved in a fatal accident , but is unlikely to do so before the end of the @entity7 's investigation .			2

disintegration so complete parts were small enough to drift miles in wind
