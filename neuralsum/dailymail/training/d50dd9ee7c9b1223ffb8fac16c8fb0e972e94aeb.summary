by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 02:36 est , 25 october 2013 night club promoters who released a video of students joking about girls being raped have been condemned by police			1
the event , called ‘ @entity9 ’ , was being hosted by the events company @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
the film , which was used to promote the night , featured clips of male clubbers talking about ‘ violating ’ other students with one suggesting a girl was going to ' get raped '			1
shameful : a grab from the promotional video which was made by @entity21 to promote their student night out @entity13 police investigated and said the footage was ‘ highly inappropriate and sexually suggestive			1
' a report published by the force said young men were ‘ being encouraged to engage in violent sexual acts against females ’ and that the video ' encourages violent sex , degrades women and poses a ‘ real threat to public safety ’			2
during the clip , a presenter went around the venue , interviewing clubbers and asked : ' how are you going to violate a fresher tonight ? ' one student replied by saying : ' i ’ve got one here with me who ’s just disappeared			1
anger : students protested at the video featuring jokes about girls being raped last thursday night outside @entity50 at a demonstration attended by more than 160 people			1
a petition has gathered more than 3,000 signatures he then waits for a few seconds before she returns and says ' there she is			0
' then the promotional staff member asks : ' and what are you going to do to her tonight ?			0
' the student replies : ' well she ’s paying for the cab , she ’s paying for the drinks , ' before adding ' she ’s going to get raped			0
' another said : ' violate is a very strong word			0
i ’m going to take advantage of someone			2
' venue : the controversial night was held at @entity12 which is having its licence reviewed by the city council the presenter also asks one student : ' how are you going to bring girls back to your little den ? ' the video was taken down from @entity78 and @entity79 after receiving negative comments and @entity81 have since apologised			1
as a result of the controversy @entity11 could be stripped of its licence by @entity85 , who are reviewing the case			1
students took to @entity21 @entity81 ’s @entity79 page to criticse the sickening promotional campaign			1
one student wrote : ' what made you think that advocating rape and sexual assault was ever an okay thing to do , let alone in a poor attempt to promote your club nights ? defence : the club 's managers claim over the last six years the promotion company has been ' responsible ' and well behaved ' this is the definition of rape culture			1
' students launched a petition with thousands of signatures in opposition and a late - night protest was staged outside the club			2
@entity110 have also said they are keen to work on a zero tolerance campaign against sexual assault at venues around the city centre			0
a spokesperson for @entity81 posted a statement on @entity79 at the time which read : ' this video has been removed whilst we investigate thoroughly			2
' we do not normalise , excuse , tolerate or condone rape or sexual abuse of any sort			0
@entity21 has promoted a safe environment for students to enjoy themselves responsibly for the last 21 years			1
the @entity21 video prompted outrage because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the trivialisation of rape is seen as ' banter ' @entity132 , @entity134 's @entity133 's @entity135 ' we will continue to maintain our duty of care as we always have done			1
we apologise for any offence that has been caused			0
' police are also looking into free - pouring - where bar staff pour alcohol straight into customers ’ mouths from the bottle , which contradicts licencing laws			2
a statement issued by @entity148 said : ' we have taken this matter very seriously			0
' over the last six years that we have worked with @entity81 , they have proved themselves to be very responsible promoters			0
' their clientele are always polite and well behaved and we have never had any reports of serious offences in relation to the night			2
' we are cooperating fully with the licensing authority and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly			0
' the night was banned in @entity159 two years ago after posters depicting a woman performing a sex act on another man were distributed around houses in the area			2
@entity167 and @entity168 have both voiced their support for the campaign to stop the event			0
@entity132 , @entity167 's @entity135 officer , said : ' the @entity21 video prompted outrage because it was a particularly extreme example of a culture in which the trivialisation of rape is seen as ' banter '			1
' it provoked a reaction from a diversity of students and residents , which was demonstrated at our protest last thursday night at which over 160 people attended and the petition which gathered over 3000 signatures			0
' i think that rape culture and lad banter are not problems that are specific to @entity193 but stem from societal attitudes towards sexual consent and objectification which are prevalent everywhere			0
' we are now creating a zero tolerance pledge for nightclubs to sign up to , which will mean that they have to introduce zero tolerance to sexual harassment policies and refrain from using sexual objectification in their advertising			0
' a @entity207 spokesman said : ' licensing officers have been made aware and have spoken to the promoters and the venue 's management			1
' they are continuing to assess the situation			0
