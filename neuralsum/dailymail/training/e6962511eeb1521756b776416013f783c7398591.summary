@entity1 is scheduled to be executed on thursday for the 1999 murder of her husband after prosecutors struck deals with her son who admitted to pulling the trigger and the man she allegedly hired to arrange the murder			1
her husband @entity18 was killed by a gunshot in his @entity20 , @entity4 home in 1999 and state prosecutors made the case that she arranged to have him killed while she was in the hospital			1
her son @entity25 has since confessed to killing his father in a fit of rage after his dad called him a ' b * * * * * * , no good , mistake and telling me i 'm inconciderate ( sic ) and just care about my self , ' according to @entity33			0
he made the confessions in letters riddled with spelling mistakes that he sent to her while she was in jail			0
' he slaps me , then goes back to his room			0
as i sat on my bed , tears of rage flowing , remembering my childhood , my anger kept building and building , ' her son wrote in one letter			0
the @entity50 tells how the @entity52 sheriff 's office decided to arrest ' @entity53 ' for his connection to the murder - for - hire plot but they did not give him the most extreme charge			1
even though he led authorities to the murder weapon and was the only one with gunpowder residue on his hands after the june 4 , 1999 shooting , they argued that his mother was the mastermind behind the plot			1
he told investigators how she was going to pay his friend @entity76 $ 15,000 once she was granted access to her husband 's life insurance policy if @entity76 would be the one to kill him			0
mental issues : @entity25 , seen in this earlier undated photo , was being treated for ingesting rat poison at the time that her husband was shot dead in 1999 ' when they got me here , i gave them a bulls * * * story after another , trying to save my own ass , but when ( @entity93 ) @entity92 started questioning me , and told me what happened , i was so scared , confused , and high , i just started spitting the first thought out , which turned in to this big conspiracy thing , for money , which was all bs , that 's why i had so many different stories , ' @entity53 wrote in one of the three confessional letters ot his mother			1
her advocates described @entity1 as being a victim of both domestic violence and sex abuse , starting when she was a child and her stepfather allegedly forced her into prostitution and continuing when she started her relationship with @entity18 when she was only 16 and he was 31			0
the @entity50 reports that he abused her throughout their relationship and videotaped her when he forced her to have sex with other men			0
their son , @entity53 , was born three years after they first got together and they married when the boy was 5 - years - old			2
with his birth , @entity18 got a new target for his abuse			0
' ( @entity121 ) was fixing to go to bed when my dad came in , and said , " what do you think your [ sic ] doing coming in at this time ? " and before i could answer , he shoves me down , and my back hits the book shelf , and i begin to get up , and he grabs me and slaps me twice , and says , ' you were a f * * * * * * mistake to begin with ! ' and shuts my door and leaves ... he was always like that , ' @entity53 wrote in one letter			2
time running out : @entity1 , who is now 56 , has had a number of appeals but critical evidence - like her son 's confessions - were not allowed to be taken into account @entity1 tried to leave her husband but he threatened her and beat her more			1
she developed unspecified mental disorders , and in the days leading up to his murder she tried to kill herself by ingesting poison			2
' it just has n't seem to gotten through that people in horribly abusive situations are doing things that do n't look reasonable , like taking rat poison so she can stay in the hospital and get some temporary relief from the situation , ' @entity143 from the @entity144 of @entity4 told the paper			1
' that 's not a strategy that looks reasonable , ( but in the hospital ) nobody 's actually abusing her right this minute			0
' abused : both ' @entity53 ' ( pictured left and right ) and his mother were physically abused - and his mother was sexually - by their father before @entity53 shot him in a fit of rage police questioned her about the murder while she was on prescribed medication and she did not confess			1
only later at the police station when the detective said that her son had confessed and she should protect him did she repeat exactly what the detective told her about her son 's confession			1
multiple appeals have ruled with the original conviction as a result of key evidence - like the letters from her son and his original confession - being kept out of the trial as a result of specific legal wrangling			2
' the majority of @entity4 support the death penalty because they think that people get fair trials and they think that they have competent attorneys representing them , ' former state @entity185 told @entity33			2
' in this case , she did n't have either one			0
' the only person who can commute the death sentence is the governor of @entity4 , @entity195 .			0

@entity1 , 56 , has been convicted of *planning* a murder - for - hire plot against her abusive husband who was shot dead in 1999
she is scheduled to be executed on thursday in @entity4
if it goes through , she will be the first woman to die of lethal injection in the state since 1944
her son @entity53 served time for a *lesser* charge and was let out of jail last year in spite of confessing to being the one who killed his dad
prosecutors portrayed her as the ' mastermind ' behind the plot but she was being treated for ingesting rat poison at the time of his murder
has exhausted her appeals but *juries* were never allowed to consider certain pieces of evidence like her son 's lost police interview
