the prospect of a ' @entity3 ' alliance between @entity4 and @entity5 is now just as likely as a coalition between the @entity7 and @entity8 , @entity0 claimed today			1
the deputy prime minister said there was a ' very real danger ' that @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13 could hold mr @entity4 to ' ransom ' in the event of a second hung @entity16			2
mr @entity0 's remarks come after mr @entity5 held out an olive branch to the prime minister last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible @entity8 government			1
the @entity21 released a new campaign poster this morning warning of the danger of a ' @entity26 ' alliance between the @entity27 and @entity12 the @entity12 leader called on @entity29 to vote tactically for him in seats where they can not win in order to help keep the @entity29 leader as prime minister			1
and in the strongest hint yet that they could work together , mr @entity5 dropped his demand that the @entity27 ditch mr @entity4 before any post election deal			1
deputy prime minister @entity0 said the remarks showed that the ' mood music ' had changed in the @entity29			0
he said : ' only yesterday there were reports of @entity5 opening ' back channels ' with the @entity27 to discuss a post-election pact			2
' the @entity29 right wing has been waiting for its moment to reclaim the @entity29 for years			0
' and , with the help of mps from @entity12 and the @entity13 , that moment may be about to come			0
' mr @entity0 added : ' everyone knows that @entity4 and @entity53 wo n't win this general election outright			1
' that means that someone else will hold the balance of power on 8 may			0
the prospect of a left wing alliance between @entity8 and the @entity7 has been well covered			0
' the deputy prime minister said there was a ' very real danger ' that @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13 could hold mr @entity4 to ' ransom ' in the event of a second hung @entity16 but he added : ' what 's equally possible is an alliance that will drag @entity66 further and further to the right : @entity68 – a bloc of right wingers from @entity12 , the conservatives and the @entity13 that could hold the balance of power			1
' there is a very real danger that @entity5 and his friends could hold @entity4 to ransom			2
' it comes after mr @entity5 issued a direct appeal to @entity29 voters yesterday			2
mr @entity5 said he believed many were in ' their hearts ' closer to his position of wanting an @entity84 referendum as soon as possible without any attempted re-negotiation			2
mr @entity5 also revealed that he has already held informal discussions with @entity27 about potential post-election arrangements			1
yesterday , as he launched his party 's manifesto , mr @entity5 called on mr @entity4 to join with him to lock @entity53 and the @entity7 's @entity90 out of @entity91			1
the @entity21 leader 's remarks come after mr @entity5 ( right ) held out an olive branch to the prime minister ( pictured in @entity96 this morning left ) last night - as he said he wanted to work with him to prevent a possible @entity8 government @entity12 has reduced its list of targets to just ten seats as it has been squeezed in the polls , but mr @entity5 believes in seats such as @entity105 and @entity106 it has a better chance than the @entity27 at snatching them from @entity8			1
asked if it was time that conservative supporters realised that @entity12 could help them stop a @entity8 government , mr @entity5 said they needed to vote tactically			1
he said : ' one of the things i have completely failed to understand is how the @entity29 would want to say vote @entity12 get @entity8 in constituencies like @entity118 and @entity119 and @entity106 and all those @entity8 seats in which we are the challenger			2
i just do n't understand it			0
' he warned that a @entity8 - led government backed up by the @entity7 ' would not be a very good thing for the country '			0
@entity13 leader @entity128 could help prop up the @entity27 in power in the event of another hung @entity16 asked if he and mr @entity4 could ' lock out ' mr @entity53 and mr @entity90 from @entity91 , he replied : ' well if that were possible then we would try and do that			2
' mr @entity5 previously said that mr @entity4 would need to step down as @entity29 leader before he could do any sort of post-election deal			1
but yesterday he said there would be no problem working with mr @entity4 personally			0
he said : ' albeit reluctantly , @entity4 has been forced into making a pledge on a referendum			0
there are circumstances in which we could do a deal with him but the referendum has got to be a proper one and not in 2017			0
' mr @entity4 a fortnight ago urged @entity29 supporters who have defected to @entity12 to ' come home ' and pleaded with them not to use their vote in the @entity151 as a ' protest '			1
yesterday asked what his message was to @entity29 voters , mr @entity5 called on them to work with him to bring forward the referendum mr @entity4 has promised on @entity84 membership by 2017			1
he made a reference to comments by @entity160 , the @entity161 president , that any meaningful renegotiation would not be possible until 2019			0
he said : ' i 've said from the start there is no re-negotiation of any value whatsoever and it would appear that my old mate mr @entity160 is backing that up			0
' the idea that we would need to wait for two or more years for a referendum is not something that i find acceptable			0
' mr @entity5 said he would also want the @entity27 to match his commitment to @entity176 's target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence			1
he admitted that he had already been involved in ' informal ' discussions with those in other parties about possible deals			0
