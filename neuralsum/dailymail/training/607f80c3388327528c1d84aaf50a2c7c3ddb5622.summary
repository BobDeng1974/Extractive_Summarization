by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter two associates of former @entity5 tight end @entity4 were indicted friday on murder charges in the shooting death last summer of @entity8			1
a grand jury in @entity10 indicted both @entity11 and @entity12 in the june 2013 killing of semi-professional football player @entity8 , district attorney c. @entity14 said , and their lawyers are blasting the moves			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , who are from @entity10 , @entity17 , where @entity4 grew up , had previously been charged with accessory to murder after the fact and pleaded not guilty			1
they had been ordered held on $ 500,000 bail on the older charges and remained in custody			0
charged : @entity12 and @entity11 ' @entity12 did not shoot or kill anyone , ' lawyer @entity25 told the @entity27 in his client 's defense			1
' he nature and timing of this new charge against mr. @entity12 speaks for itself			2
' one can only ask , is it based on the facts and the law , or something else ? @entity12 looks forward to confronting his accusers in a court of law			2
' @entity11 's lawyer , @entity40 , said he had not seen the indictment but called it ' totally ridiculous			2
' he said , as he had in the past , that @entity11 was ' just along for the ride ' with @entity4 , @entity12 and @entity8 on the night @entity8 was killed			1
' we started out having a gun [ charge ] , then accessory after the fact [ of murder ] , and now we ’re up to first - degree murder , ' @entity40 told the @entity27			0
' this is absolutely crazy			0
' @entity40 insisted the district attorney 's office has strung his client along , charging him first with a weapons violation , then accusing him of being an accessory			0
' it almost looks to me like they felt they could n't use him as a witness , ( so ) they 're going to charge him ? ' he said			0
' why would n't they have done this months ago ? there 's no new evidence in this matter			0
' @entity4 has pleaded not guilty to murder in the killing of @entity8 , a 27 - year - old @entity68 resident who was dating the sister of @entity4 's fiancee , @entity69			1
@entity69 , who testified before the grand jury , has been charged with perjury in the case			0
@entity4 's cousin @entity74 , who refused to testify , has been charged with criminal contempt and conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact			2
both have pleaded not guilty			0
joint venture : experts believe that charging both @entity11 and @entity12 makes it easier to win a conviction against @entity4 because prosecutors no longer have to prove the former @entity85 pulled the trigger - it only has to prove he was aware of the murder and did nothing to stop it or present when it happened the district attorney 's office said friday that @entity11 and @entity12 would be arraigned in @entity91 on the new charges at a date yet to be scheduled			1
the office said it would have no further comment on the indictments until then			0
questions have been raised about the reliability of @entity11 as a witness			2
prosecutors say he has told authorities that he did n't see who shot @entity8 but that @entity4 and @entity8 were alone outside the car			1
that 's different from his initial story , in which , according to court records , he told police that @entity4 and @entity12 got out with @entity8			1
the @entity27 reported that these indictments allow the state to charge @entity4 , @entity11 and @entity12 under the ' joint venture law			1
' ' defendants can be convicted of murder if they were present at the time of a slaying , knew that a killing was about to take place , or aided or encouraged it in any way , ' the paper explained			0
@entity120 , a former district attorney now working in private practice , told the @entity27 that the credibility of any testimony from @entity11 or @entity12 can be called into question - but also that the indictments make it easier to win a murder conviction			1
' it ’s a much more difficult case to have @entity4 as the sole person charged with murder , ' he said			2
' you have no joint venture theory against people who are charged with different charges and not the murder			2
' another lawyer agreed , telling the @entity27 jurors ' might be puzzled as to why he ’s the one holding the bag , if all three of them were together			0
' @entity8 's bullet - riddled body was found by a jogger in an industrial park in @entity143			0
prosecutors have said @entity4 was upset with @entity8 for talking at a nightclub to some people with whom he had problems			1
they have not identified who they believe pulled the trigger			0
a message was left for @entity12 's attorney , @entity25			0
@entity12 has been described by prosecutors as @entity4 's ' right - hand man			1

@entity11 and @entity12 have been indited on murder charges
their lawyers blasted the moves and insisted their clients are *innocent*
experts believe the indictments will make it easier to convict @entity4 for the murder of @entity8
