@entity8 , 32 , fought the fish for 15 minutes before hauling his prize ashore - a @entity12 catfish he nicknamed @entity13 - with the help of fellow fishermen on the third attempt			1

angler @entity8 , 32 , battled for 15 minutes wrestling a giant catfish - ' @entity13 ' - at the same lake in @entity32 , @entity22			1
the @entity13 was thought to be the biggest fish in the lake until @entity36 's catch he said he was woken by an alarm attached to his reel , alerting him to a fish picking up the bait			1
he said : ' it was the last morning of the trip when i was awoken from my slumber at 5am by the sound of my alarms and a screaming reel telling me that something big had picked up my bait and was moving off at quite some pace in the opposite direction			0
' a few minutes into the fight and this fish was n’t budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster			2
' with the help of some fellow anglers , who had heard the commotion and gathered behind me , we were all able to lift the fish onto the waiting mat on the third attempt			0
' i ’ve only been catfishing for about a year , and so far that trip i ’d only managed to land a small carp so the lads were laughing at me			0
' a few minutes into the fight and this fish was n't budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster ' - angler @entity8 ' they were n’t laughing after i caught the @entity13 though			1
before the @entity13 , the biggest fish i ’ve ever caught was probably only a 5lb catfish			1
' i could n’t believe it			0
it was like a serpent , when we were pulling it in , it just kept coming out of the water like a serpent			0
' the carnivorous fish , known as @entity13 , is well over 30 - years - old , and is the second biggest freshwater fish ever caught			1
mr @entity8 , who works as a dj , added : ' i stood there in total shock and disbelief			2
' to say i was over the moon was an understatement			0
it was the largest fish i have ever seen on the bank and the most amazing experience of my life			0
