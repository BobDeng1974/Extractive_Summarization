it 's that time of year when football managers double as mathematicians			1
with points running out and prizes at a premium , they 're praying the calculator tells them the dream is still alive			1
but for those at the top of a claustrophobic @entity12 , the maths is simple — win every game or risk missing out on a potential £ 120million payday			1
two points separate four teams , with four games remaining			1
to drop points would almost certainly mean to drop out of the race for the two automatic slots to the @entity21			1
@entity22 were top on @entity23 but are fourth going into the visit of @entity25			2
@entity26 is not wasting his time on permutations			2
@entity29 ( centre ) fires @entity22 1 - 0 ahead against @entity31 in the @entity12 match @entity22 boss @entity26 ( right ) is targeting wins from all of his side 's remaining fixtures this season ' we have to win our games , ' said the @entity38			1
' i think by winning four games we will get promotion , but it is very difficult			1
we have to forget the other teams and just concentrate on our games			1
' wolves are seven points behind @entity22 but only outside the play - offs on goal difference after saturday 's 2 - 1 defeat to @entity50 rivals @entity49			2
and head coach @entity51 admits they have played must - win games for a while			1
he said : ' it seems to have been that way for about three months , where we have been chasing			2
' we have been working hard to make sure the sides at the top do n't get away			2
it 's good we 're in this position			2
we want to be a @entity21 club			1
' @entity64 ( left ) is congratulated after scoring his side 's second goal against @entity67 in their last game @entity70 boss @entity69 insists that his side are not getting carried away at the top of the table the @entity12 leaders @entity70 travel to @entity75			1
and the message from @entity69 to his team is very much : ' do n't get ahead of yourselves '			0
' with every win , we take it away from some of the teams that have been challenging all season , but i still think it is anyone 's , ' said @entity69			1
' we have to focus on every game , not get complacent , and remember that this league has a habit of throwing up surprises			0
we want to make sure that we stay strong until the end			0
' @entity94 are the division 's form team having won four on the spin and , ahead of their trip to @entity99 , manager @entity93 said : ' my job is simple			0
i said it before ( saturday 's 2 - 1 win at @entity103 ) we had five left and we had to win every one			0
now we have four it 's the same			0
' @entity103 ' @entity106 ( left ) and @entity94 's @entity107 ( right ) battle for the ball @entity109 are the team sandwiched in third and they have the benefit of seeing how their rivals perform before they take on @entity114 at the @entity115 on wednesday			0
the leading quartet could all guarantee their place in the play - offs at least with midweek victories			0
but for the chasing pack , four must go into two			0
@entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity25 are within just one point of each other and must produce title - winning form between now and may 2 to be sure of post-season participation			0
meanwhile , matters at the bottom of the table have been complicated after @entity31 were charged yesterday with fielding an ineligible player			0
@entity121 loanee @entity132 played in their 1 - 0 win over @entity67 on @entity135 but there is confusion as to whether the defender had already been recalled			0
@entity31 are seven points above the drop zone and will nervously await the outcome of their @entity143 hearing , especially if @entity144 — with a game in hand — narrow that gap to four with victory over fellow strugglers @entity149			0
elsewhere in the @entity151 this week , @entity150 will be championship - bound with a win at @entity153 , while @entity156 's @entity155 side and @entity157 could leave @entity158 behind them if they triumph against @entity159 and @entity160 respectively — and other results go their way			1
@entity121 striker @entity163 turns to celebrate scoring a late equaliser against @entity123			0

there are eight teams in *contention* for promotion to the @entity21
every side involved will be targeting wins from their remaining games
prize money for promotion could come in at £ 120 million
