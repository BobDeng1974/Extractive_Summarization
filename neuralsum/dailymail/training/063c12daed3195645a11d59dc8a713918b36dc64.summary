@entity10 ’s parents @entity27 and @entity28 say they have a bond that should never be broken - and @entity10 ’s doctors agree			1
but @entity8 is a breed classified as a fighting dog in the state of @entity35 near @entity36 where @entity10 lives			1
and she bit a neighbour ’s dog last month in a kerbside scrap			1
this , say authorities , means she must move out - or be destroyed			2

' his breathing becomes quieter , his heart rate falls			0
that could only be because of this dog			0

@entity10 's father @entity27 the family moved to the small town of @entity76 in @entity35 from @entity36 to give @entity10 more peaceful surroundings			1
but unlike @entity36 , @entity35 has a dangerous dog breed law that does not permit @entity79			2
until recently , the district had not objected to @entity8 as she has been neutered , properly reported and has received training from certified dog trainers			2
she also has passed temperament tests			0
but due to her dogfight with involving the neighbour ’s pet the authorities are now enforcing the law			2
the @entity89 said the fight was n’t even started by @entity8			2
nonetheless , the @entity91 paid for the veterinary treatment for the injured dog and apologised for what happened			0
the dog is expected to fully recover from his injuries			0
outrage : more than 94,000 people have signed a petition on @entity58 demanding the decision be reversed but the family have been told that @entity8 must move on or die			1
the @entity102 is supporting the family legally , stating : ' if necessary , we will bring this matter before the @entity106 ' - the highest in @entity1			0
@entity10 's doctor also has spoken out for @entity10 , saying the dog acts as a therapy dog for the critically ill boy and ' strongly advises ' against taking @entity8 away from him			1
' we could really use the support of the authorities , ' said @entity27			0
' we must keep @entity8 for @entity10 ’s sake , for every little spark of happiness that she brings to him			1
' @entity117 mayor @entity116 said : ' my hands are tied			0
the case is clear : the dog bit another			2
' what happens if he was to bite a person , or the child himself ? ' but a glimmer of hope is on the horizon : the parents are scheduled for a meeting with the mayor and other officials next week in the wake of the firestorm of protest			0
the mayor ’s office said that if the parents can prove @entity8 is a ' therapy dog ' , they will ' try to find a solution to this problem			1
' @entity27 , 49 , said : ' they have already been around several times trying to take her away to kill her			0
i will believe it when i see it			0
