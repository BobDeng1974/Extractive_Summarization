an @entity1 experiment carried out by astronauts on the @entity3 has found the cosmos is less hostile to space travellers than expected			1
it had been thought that cosmic radiation may severely limit the time an astronaut can spend in space without seriously risking their life			1
using a ' phantom ' human covered in thousands of detectors , the research showed that levels of radiation had been significantly overestimated - and deep space travel could be fairly safe			1
an experiment run by @entity1 on the @entity3 using a ' dummy ' human ( shown ) has found radiation levels for astronauts in space are less than thought			1
the findings suggest deep space travel for humans could be safe			1
here the dummy is shown being put in a casing to simulate the spacesuit of an astronaut the experiment involved placing a mannequin in direct exposure to cosmic radiation , twice inside the @entity3 and once outside in space			1
known as @entity37 , the legless torso consists of 33 slices of ' human matter ' each one inch ( 2.5cm ) in thickness			2
this includes real human bones to simulated the shape and density of soft tissues and lungs in the human body			2
inside the slices was measuring equipment to measure the amount of incoming radiation			0
the overall conclusion was that dosimeters worn by crew on the @entity3 , which measure radiation exposure , had overestimated that actual radiation does they received by 15 per cent			1
back in october a study claimed sending people to @entity59 may be impossible due to an increased radiation risk from cosmic rays when the sun is less active during the solar minimum			1
it 's thought that a predicted decrease in solar activity , which occurs every 11 years , will raise the levels of radiation astronauts are subjected to from cosmic rays on a deep space mission			1
this will increase the risk of suffering sickness , cancer and more on lengthy trips to the red planet lasting about a year to levels beyond what is considered safe			0
the research , published in the journal @entity81 and led by dr @entity82 of the @entity83 , found that a 30 - year - old astronaut can spend about one year in space before cosmic rays raises the radiation - risk beyond safe exposure limits			1
however , this new research by @entity1 could suggest the levels are safer than expected			2
amazingly , outside the @entity3 in open space this overestimation exceeded 200 per cent			1
from the results of the @entity96 experiment the scientists concluded that travel of astronauts to the @entity99 or to @entity59 may be somewhat safer in terms of their radiation hazard than expected			1
nevertheless , the doses the space travellers are likely to receive , even though being lower than thought earlier , would still remain dangerously high			2
but while @entity59 might previously have been limited to a year or so , now the time taken to explore @entity59 could potentially be extended			2
' one may say that we found open space to be a bit less hostile to humans than expected , ' said dr @entity110 , an associate professor at the @entity111 of the @entity112 ( @entity113 ) in @entity114 , @entity115			2
' the effective doses , related to the health risk of the astronauts and calculated from measurements with our detectors , were lower than those indicated by dosimeters worn by the astronauts			0
' however , he added further information from beyond low @entity128 orbit would be needed to verify the findings			0
' we must remember that measurements within the @entity133 experiment were performed at low @entity128 orbit where the @entity128 's magnetosphere significantly reduces the number of charged particles from cosmic radiation , ' he said			1
' in interplanetary space there is no such shielding			0
' this is the interior structure of the phantom used in the experiment @entity37 , which contains slices of human bones			2
the white tubes contain sets of thermoluminescent detectors			0
half of these detectors was manufactured by the @entity111 of the @entity112 in @entity114 , @entity115 the @entity96 phantom is seen here with astronauts @entity152 and @entity154 on board of the @entity3			0
radiation levels were measured both inside the station and outside in open space using the human - like dummy a long - standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high - energy particles from space that hit @entity128			1
called cosmic rays , they 're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at @entity171 's @entity170			0
they strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles , mostly muons , electrons and photons , over a wide area			0
though they were discovered decades ago , cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare , making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated			0
it 's thought that some come from supernovas , but it 's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well			0
the main hazard to the astronaut 's health due to exposure to cosmic radiation is the increased probability of developing cancer in his or her body			1
this probability however is quite dependent on the type of radiation the astronaut is exposed to			0
most of the natural sources of ionising radiation on @entity128 produce electromagnetic radiation of high energy - gamma rays			0
on the other hand , in cosmic rays , energetic protons or heavier ions dominate , which are much more effective in creating cancer cells			0
the mannequin on board of the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , with thermoluminescent and plastic detectors inside its ' body ' , was also dressed in a ' poncho ' with additional detectors , simulating the personal dosimeters worn by astronauts			0
thus , doses recorded by individual dosimeters of the @entity3 crew could be compared with those actually absorbed inside their bodies			0
over the years 2004 to 2009 the @entity96 mannequin underwent three exposures to cosmic radiation , each lasting a year of more			1
two of these exposures occurred inside the @entity241 modules of the space station and for one exposure the phantom , in a container imitating the shielding properties of a spacesuit , was placed in open space outside the @entity250 measurements have never been done before			0
the detectors were then returned to @entity128 to be analysed to make the findings , which could make the possibility of a manned mission to @entity59 more likely .			2

experiment run by @entity1 on the @entity3 has found radiation levels for humans in space are less than thought
the findings suggest deep space travel for humans could be safe
previously missions to @entity59 were thought to be very dangerous due to high exposures to cosmic radiation
but new results say levels may have been overestimated by 200 per cent
experiment involved using a ' dummy ' human on the @entity3
this had slices of human bone to simulate lungs , *organs* and tissues
