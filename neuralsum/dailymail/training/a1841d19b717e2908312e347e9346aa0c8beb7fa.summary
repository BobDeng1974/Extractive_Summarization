lord @entity9 was nominated by the prime minister to be the @entity12 's @entity11 , at a crucial time for his hopes of renegotiating @entity12 's relationship with the @entity5			1
but after being selected for the financial services brief , doubts have been raised about the @entity20 peer 's suitability for the job , as he told @entity22 that he intends to serve @entity24 interests and not the @entity25 's in his new role of financial regulator			2
vow : conservative peer @entity9 has promised meps that he intents to serve @entity24 interests and not the @entity25 's in his new role of financial regulator lord @entity9 was a surprise choice for the commissioner role in july , after previously ruling himself out because he wanted to stay in @entity12			1
it was seen as a coup for the @entity12 when new commission president @entity36 handed him the financial services brief			1
appearing at a confirmation hearing yesterday , he appeared to charm meps with jokes about the @entity41 but he left them short of details , and will be recalled for a second questioning session next week			1
@entity46 mep @entity45 , who was among those to grill lord @entity9 yesterday , dismissed him as ' charming but empty '			0
he told @entity48 's today programme : ' @entity9 is a charming person but behind his charm there was apparently little knowledge of the subject matter at hand			2

he suggested that criticism of @entity9 would be more intense were @entity12 's relationship with @entity1 not already under strain			1
' no one would claim that he had knowledge of the issues at hand			0

' he may be a good commissioner , but i would probably not assign him this portfolio			0
' during the hearing , lord @entity9 promised to put @entity24 laws before the interests of @entity87 , denying accusations that as a former lobbyist he would be a stooge for @entity12 's financial services industry			1

the fate of @entity109 's energy and climate commissioner - designate @entity110 was also in doubt after he faced a barrage of questions about alleged conflicts of interest and sexism			2

lord @entity9 's nomination in september was widely seen as an olive branch from mr @entity36 to an increasingly europhobic mr @entity3 , who has promised a refrendum on @entity12 's @entity5 membership in 2017			1
decision : the @entity92 can ask @entity36 to change members of his line - up - as it has done previously in 2004 and 2009 - and it must approve the entire commission in a vote on october 22 but he insisted that he backed strong regulation , saying he was ' not here as a representative of the @entity25 '			1
he joked to meps about his poor command of foreign languages , and won applause by brushing off a question from a eurosceptic @entity12 lawmaker about his loyalty to @entity137 however , a @entity24 source later said that his answers ' lacked content ' and that he would get a ' second chance ' next monday or tuesday to explain the details of his policy on key financial issues			2

@entity191 's @entity190 , a former justice minister , faced a rough ride too on wednesday , having repeatedly clashed with the @entity5 over @entity191 prime minster @entity194 's crackdown on media regulation and the justice system			2
his nomination as @entity199 commissioner was particuarly galling to critics given @entity201 's deep euroscepticsm - @entity194 and @entity12 's @entity3 were the only national leaders to oppose @entity36 's election in june			1
