‘ where are you planning on building your presidential library - in @entity140 or in your home country of @entity142 ? ’ later when @entity2 began talking about the benefits of the @entity15 , @entity4 interrupted him by saying : ‘ is this what they mean by drones ? ’ ‘ ( @entity75 ) that 's the thing that does n't work ? why would you get the guy that created the @entity79 to make your website ? ’ the big reveal : at the end , the president pushed the red button and the backdrop fell to the ground showing that they were in the @entity159 of the @entity160 the skit ended when @entity2 pressed the red button that was a seemingly random addition to the set , and the black backdrop subsequently fell to the ground , revealing that the short was being filmed in the @entity167			1
