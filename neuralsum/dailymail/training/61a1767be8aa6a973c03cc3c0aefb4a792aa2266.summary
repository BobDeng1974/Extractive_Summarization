use your phone to order drinks without leaving your table thanks to the @entity16 app , right , which is due to be rolled out nationwide from next month you 'll never need to leave an interesting conversation with your friends again thanks to the @entity16 app ( but you 'll never get out of a boring one , either ... ) the @entity16 app - currently being used in the @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , and due to be rolled out nationwide from next month - lets pub - goers place their orders for drinks online and be alerted when the bartender has made them			1
and you can even do this from home , meaning when you arrive at the pub there will be a nice chilled round waiting for you and your friends at your table			2
@entity42 , operations director of the @entity43 , which owns the @entity44 , told @entity45 : ' the way you order drinks in a pub has n't changed for a thousand years			1
this is trying to get away from the @entity51 mentality towards change in pubs			2
' but customers will still be able to have friendly contact with pub staff			0
i think it 's an extension of the relationship			0
do n't forget , the drink will be brought to the table by a member of staff			0
' when customers order drinks the barman is notified on his @entity67 and begins mixing , alerting the customer via the app when their order is ready when a customer orders drinks the barman is notified via his @entity67 , and when he starts making drinks the customer receives a message			1
he receives another when the drinks are ready			1
@entity44 manager @entity78 said the app is working well , and that ' people are always more comfortable when they 're sat at their table than when they 're stood at the bar '			2
he added : ' when you have to go to the bar , you have to break that conversation mid-flow			0
with this , the conversation does n't stop			0
' @entity16 's chief operating officer @entity86 said the app should enhance the social drinking experience : ' it 's about enhancing customer service , it 's not taking away the customer 's ability , when the pub 's empty , to go to the bar and talk to the barman			1
it makes life a little easier			0
