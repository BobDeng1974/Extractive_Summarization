it looks just like that speeder chase on the @entity2 ... if you squint really , really hard			1
in fact it 's a stunt by hardcore drone - owners , who have emulated their favourite @entity9 scene by racing £ 150 quadcopters through the woods			1
the group of men - and they do seem to be mostly men - wear goggle - mounted monitors as they race radio - controlled machines at up to 70mph near their homes in the @entity19			1
it is carefully modelled on one of the climactic scenes in the 1983 hit @entity32 : @entity32 , when @entity46 whizzes through the woods in a bid to stop stormtroopers from sounding the alarm			1
there are a few crucial differences			0
the course is marked out with red - and - white tape and plastic tree - mounted arrows , so the fiery crashes are less likely			2
and instead of using the force , the enthusiasts see through a front - mounted camera while another films the experience for a highlights clip			1
but the members of @entity64 , a group of 60 radio - controlled flying machine hobbyists who live in @entity67 , southern @entity68 , insist theirs is still an adrenaline - junkie 's sport			1
event : the drone enthusiasts in the @entity19 meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz through the woods hobbyists : one of the 60 members of the @entity64 group with his £ 150 radio - controlled machine in the forest they meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz around the woodland , and insist their high - speed drones rarely break down despite the pressure they 're placed under			1
group founder @entity89 , 44 , said : ' when we first started there were a lot of broken drones			1
' it takes some practice to fly them - even now there are a few crashes whenever several drones round a tight corner			0
but the drones are very light so they do n't break easily and can take a fall quite well			0
' the smartphone app designer added : ' when me and my friends first started chasing each others ' drones around i thought to myself " wow , this is just like @entity9 " - especially when we 're in the woods			2
' i used to be a champion skateboarder , but an injury meant i had to stop			0
' i 'm addicted to adrenaline , and drone racing gives me a chance to get some excitement			2
flying through the woods at super speed is pretty thrilling			0
@entity118 : the contraptions , with front - mounted cameras , are capable of reaching top speeds of 70mph @entity122 : the men insist there are fewer fiery high - speed crashes into trees than in the 1983 blockbuster delicate : the quadcopter racers admit that ' when we first started there were a lot of broken drones ' cheap : despite their advanced technology , the racers insist their £ 150 contraptions are very affordable ' i found a piece of forest and i negotiated with the council to let us fly there on weekday lunchtimes			1
all of us leave work and meet up for a race over lunch			0
' each quadcopter has two cameras mounted on the front - one to relay the video to a pair of goggles which acts as monitor , and another to record the flight			2
mr @entity89 said he hopes the sport will become popular all over the world			2
' drone racing is a new motorsport for the 21st century , ' he said			2
' we would like people to set up their own quadcopter clubs and events			0
i would love it if there was a league			0
' the sport is so representative of the time we live in			0
it uses state - of - the - art technology			0
' adrenaline junkies : the members of the group			0
