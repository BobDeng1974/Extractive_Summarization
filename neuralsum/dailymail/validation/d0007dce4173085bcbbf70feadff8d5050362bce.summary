scientists using the @entity2 have confirmed that the @entity5 - orbiting moon @entity3 has an ocean beneath its icy surface , raising the prospects for life , @entity0 has revealed			1
the finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the solar system after @entity0 's now - defunct @entity15 spacecraft provided hints that @entity3 has a subsurface ocean during exploration of @entity5 and its moons from 1995 to 2003			1
scientists told reporters on a conference call that it took some detective work to confirm the discovery			0
in this artist ’s concept , the @entity26 orbits the giant planet @entity5			1
a saline ocean under the moon ’s icy crust best explains shifting in the auroral belts measured by @entity2			1
scientists first suspected an ocean in @entity3 in the 1970s , based on models of the large moon			1
@entity0 's @entity15 mission measured @entity3 's magnetic field in 2002 , providing the first evidence supporting those suspicions			0
the @entity15 spacecraft took brief ' snapshot ' measurements of the magnetic field in 20 - minute intervals , but its observations were too brief to distinctly catch the cyclical rocking of the ocean 's secondary magnetic field			1
like @entity51 , @entity3 has a liquid iron core that generates a magnetic field , though @entity3 's field is embedded within @entity5 's magnetic field			2
that sets up an interesting dynamic with telltale visuals - twin bands of glowing aurora around @entity3 's northern and southern polar regions			0
as @entity5 rotates , its magnetic field shifts , causing @entity3 's aurora to rock			2
scientists measured the motion and found it fell short			0
using computer models , they realized that a salty , electrically conductive ocean beneath the moon 's surface was counteracting @entity5 's magnetic pull			1
' @entity5 is like a lighthouse whose magnetic field changes with the rotation of the lighthouse			2
it influences the aurora , ' said geophysicist @entity79 , with the @entity80 in @entity81			0
' with the ocean , the rocking is significantly reduced			0
' scientists ran more than 100 computer models to see if anything else could be having an impact on @entity3 's aurora			0
they also repeated the seven - hour , ultraviolet @entity2 observations and analyzed data for both belts of aurora			1
' this gives us confidence in the measurement , ' @entity79 said			0
@entity0 associate administrator @entity97 called the finding ' an astounding demonstration			0
' ' they developed new approach to look inside a planetary body with a telescope , ' @entity97 said			0
@entity3 joins a growing list of moons in the outer solar system with subsurface water			1
on wednesday , scientists reported that @entity111 's moon @entity109 has hot springs beneath its icy crust			0
other water - rich worlds include @entity116 and @entity117			0
@entity0 @entity2 images of @entity3 's auroral belts ( colored blue in this illustration ) are overlaid on a @entity15 orbiter image of the moon			1
the amount of rocking of the moon 's magnetic field suggests that the moon has a subsurface saltwater ocean			2
scientists estimate the ocean is 60 miles ( 100 km ) thick , 10 times deeper than @entity51 's oceans , and is buried under a 95 - mile ( 150 - km ) crust of mostly ice			2
' it is one step further toward finding that habitable , water - rich environment in our solar system , ' said astronomer @entity140 with the @entity142 - based @entity141 .			1
