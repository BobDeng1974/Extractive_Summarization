@entity1 legend @entity0 could line up against his former team - mates this weekend as @entity4 's side travel to the @entity5 to take on @entity7 champions @entity6 this weekend			1
@entity0 joined rivals @entity6 on a short - term loan deal after deciding to join @entity9			1
@entity10 have spoken to the likes of @entity4 and @entity12 to find out whether they think @entity0 will be cheered or jeered this weekend			1
@entity0 , pictured applauding the @entity14 crowd , may get a bad reception on sunday @entity4 ( @entity1 manager ) he made a decision and we respect that			1
i can not wish him good while he ’s playing for a direct rival , especially when he ’s playing against us , but he will always be one of my favourite ever players			2
even a few months ago , when he signed for the @entity25 team , i was not expecting this			1
but it was his decision			2
for me , it spoils nothing			0
i still believe what this club proposed to him , which is to come back when he wants			0
these were the words from mr @entity36 and this is not in any danger			0
it is just a period of his career			0
he decided to play for @entity6			2
his place in @entity1 ’s history is untouchable			2
@entity4 , pictured in 2005 , was surprised to see @entity0 join rivals @entity6 in the summer @entity47 ( 421 @entity1 appearances and four years as assistant manager to @entity4 ) he will always have a special place in the club			1
as a midfielder , to pass strikers like @entity55 and @entity56 to become the top scorer is unbelievable			0
like everyone i was surprised when he signed for @entity6 , but @entity0 is not the type to do nothing for five months if there ’s a chance to be involved			1
@entity1 have supporters who appreciate players who stay for a long time and do a good job			2
instead of being acrimonious about departures , the club enjoy the time they were there			0
former assistant manager @entity47 believes @entity1 's fans still appreciate @entity0 @entity73 ( 795 games for @entity1 , 1961 - 80 ) he ’s been a terrific servant but some of the fans i talk to were very disappointed			1
not that he left but that he signed on loan for @entity6 just a few weeks after saying he ’d never play for another @entity7 club			1
that stuck in their minds			0
maybe the pounds , shillings and pence came into it , i do n’t know			0
he ’s a terrific lad , always goes out of his way to say hello			0
when i left @entity1 it was to be player - coach at @entity92			1
i played in a pre-season game against @entity1 and i got a good reception but i never said i would n’t play for another club			1
@entity1 legend @entity73 has questioned @entity0 's decision to join @entity6 @entity98 ( 175 @entity1 games and @entity101 - winning manager in 2012 ) @entity0 has been the best midfield player in the world in the past decade			1
his consistency and attitude in delivering top performances year after year is an inspiration for any professional football player			0
an easy player to work with because of his professionalism and intelligence			0
as a person he is an honest guy with good principles and integrity			0
@entity98 , speaking to @entity0 ahead of the 2012 @entity101 final , is a fan of the @entity6 ace @entity12 ( 69 goals in 136 games for @entity1 , 2000 - 04 ) i do n’t think it changes a lot for the @entity1 fans			1
if @entity0 had been offered a contract he would have stayed			2
a lot of the fans understand that			0
i was treated really well when i played against them			0
i know @entity6 is a rival for the title and it ’s different to me , with @entity130 and @entity131 , but i think he ’ll get a good reception			1
@entity12 has praised @entity1 's fans for giving him a good reception on his return to @entity137 with @entity130 and @entity131 @entity138 ( former @entity140 cricket captain and @entity1 fan ) i hope and expect @entity0 will be treated with the respect he deserves			1
i would be amazed if he is booed			0
he is an absolute legend of the club and i believe he ’ll receive a similar ovation to @entity145 when he returned with @entity146			2
ok , i would have preferred him not to join @entity6 but it ’s a new phase in his career , linked with his move to @entity25 , and we all have to respect that			1
if he had joined @entity153 it might be a different story ... @entity138 believes @entity0 should be given a similar level of ovation as what @entity145 received when he faced @entity1 in the @entity101 @entity158 ( spokesman for cfcuk fanzine ) my all - time favourite @entity1 player and probably always will be , because of his human qualities as well as his football qualities			1
no way is he a traitor			0
we slipped up by letting him go			0
he would have been an inspiration for the young players at @entity170 and a fantastic ally for @entity4			0
i think there ’s a good chance the @entity1 fans will sing his name at the @entity5			2
fans of the west @entity179 outfit idolised @entity0 before he decided to join @entity181 's side			2

@entity1 legend @entity0 could face his former team - mates and manager this weekend
@entity0 joined @entity6 on loan after signing for @entity25
@entity189 fan could decide to give @entity0 a bad reception following his decision to join a major @entity7 rival
