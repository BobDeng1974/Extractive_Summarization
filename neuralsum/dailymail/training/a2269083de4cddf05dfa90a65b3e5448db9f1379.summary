she is the world 's most famous sea dog who went down with her ship almost 500 years ago			0
but now it has emerged that @entity5 , who drowned with the crew of the @entity7 and the only known female aboard , was male			1
dna testing of the crew has revealed the true sex of the unfortunate hound , who acquired the nickname hatch after divers found the dog 's remains near the sliding hatch door of the @entity7 's carpenter 's cabin			1
@entity5 's remains went on display four years ago at the @entity39 in @entity40 , where some of the 19,000 objects from @entity43 's ill - fated flagship are on show			2
the well - preserved skeleton of the hound , which has just a few teeth and paw bones missing , was excavated when it was brought to the surface of the @entity51 in 1982			2
without dna testing available , experts had to arrange the dog 's bones by hand and came to the conclusion that @entity5 was a female because of the size and characteristics of the bones			1
they were also able to establish from the size , shape and composition that @entity5 did not receive much exercise			0
the ship was rediscovered in 1971 and between 1979 and 1982 the entire contents of the ship were excavated the @entity7 , which was completed in 1512 , sank as she defended @entity70 from a @entity72 invasion force but the new dna test results published in @entity75 detail more accurate details about the dog			1
maritime archaeologist @entity78 , who co-authored the new report , told the @entity80 : ' genomic dna extraction is something that we have only recently been able to use in amplifying ancient dna			0
it can give us the sex , colourings , coat and regressive genes and confirm that @entity5 is in fact a boy dog			0
' the testing also suggests @entity5 shared many genetic characteristics with the modern breed of @entity95			1
the hound was most likely a cross-breed which shared some similarities with a whippet but with a dark brown and curly coat			0
on may 31 last year , the new £ 35 million museum was opened in @entity40 which shows off the artefacts raised after 34 years at sea and three wars , the @entity7 had been regarded by many as invincible			0
then , as she defended @entity70 from a @entity72 invasion force , she sank taking with her 500 men and a treasure trove of @entity33 history with her to the seafloor on july 19 , 1545			2
the ship was rediscovered by divers in 1971 and between 1979 and 1982 the entire contents of the ship were excavated resulting in the recovery of around 20,000 objects			1
last year , a new £ 35million museum was unveiled in @entity40 which shows off many thousands of the artefacts raised from the wreck .			0

@entity5 drowned with the crew of the @entity7 on july 19 , 1545
