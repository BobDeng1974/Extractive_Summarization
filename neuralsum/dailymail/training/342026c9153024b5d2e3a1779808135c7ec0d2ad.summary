a campaign has been launched to ban sir @entity1 ' hit @entity2 from being sung at @entity4 rugby matches over claims it ' glorifies domestic violence '			1
senior politician @entity8 , 71 , is leading a protest to ban the iconic ballad being sung by choirs at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity4 , because he claims it depicts a brutal revenge killing of a woman			1
the campaign over the song , which has become an unofficial anthem for @entity4 rugby fans , comes more than 40 years after it was first recorded by sir @entity1			1
however , a campaign to ban it has now been launched senior politician @entity8 , 71 , is leading a protest to ban the iconic ballad being sung by choirs at the @entity12 ( pictured ) because he claims the song depicts a brutal revenge killing of a woman bosses at the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) have defended the hit by comparing its dark subject matter to the best of @entity38 's works like @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
a spokesman said : ' within rugby , @entity2 has gained prominence through its musicality rather than because of its lyrics			2
' there is however plenty of precedent in art and literature , prominently in @entity53 tragedies for instance , for negative aspects of life to be portrayed			0
' mr @entity8 , the former president of nationalist party @entity57 and a renowned folk singer , said the song had become ' a secondary national anthem ' sung by choirs before @entity4 games			0
however , he said it should be replaced			0
he said : ' it is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it 's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem			0
' i think we should rummage around for another song instead of @entity2			0
' bosses at the @entity32 said they would be open to a public debate on the song but said they had ' not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter '			2
pictured : @entity13 's @entity12 rugby chiefs at the @entity32 defended the record but said they would listen to a public debate about the matter			1
an @entity32 spokesman said : ' the @entity32 condemns violence against women and has taken a lead role in police campaigns to highlight and combat the issue			1
i saw the light on the night that i passed by her window i saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind she was my woman as she deceived me i watched and went out of my mind my , my , my , @entity2 why , why , why , @entity2 i could see that girl was no good for me but i was lost like a slave that no man could free at break of day when that man drove away , i was waiting i cross the street to her house and she opened the door she stood there laughing i felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more my , my , my @entity2 why , why , why @entity2 so before they come to break down the door forgive me delilah i just could nâ€™t take any more ' the @entity32 remains willing to listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of @entity2 but we have not been aware of any groundswell of opinion on this matter			1
' tens of thousands of @entity4 fans happily sing along to the hit , which has become an unofficial anthem for the @entity4 rugby and football teams			0
@entity2 was recorded by sir @entity1 in 1968 and reached number two in the charts before going on to become a @entity4 favourite among fans			1
written by @entity130 and @entity131 , with music by @entity133 , the song earned @entity133 and @entity130 the 1968 @entity135 for @entity136 and lyrically			0
the @entity32 adopted the song - and often plays it before kick - off at games with the words being shown on the giant screens at the @entity13 stadium			1
mr @entity8 is not the first person to question the song 's place in the nation 's songbook			2
@entity147 , chief executive of @entity148 , which supports youth work in @entity4 , has also claimed @entity2 is offensive to female victims of domestic violence			2
but @entity4 operatic star @entity153 , who is famous for starring as @entity153 in the @entity155 insurance adverts , said @entity2 played an important part in creating atmosphere among the fans			0
he said : ' fans absolutely love it and i have been fortunate enough to sing at the stadium on a number of occasions			0
' i think anything which brings the mojo and atmosphere into the stadium is good because when that stadium is quiet it is quiet - but when it is noisy there is nowhere else like it in the world			0
