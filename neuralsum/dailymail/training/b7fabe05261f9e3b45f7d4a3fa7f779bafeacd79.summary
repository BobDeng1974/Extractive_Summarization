by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:19 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 04:58 est , 9 october 2013 a £ 1.2billion ‘ electronic borders ’ system supposed to stop terrorists , foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into @entity7 has descended into a shambles , an official report reveals today			1
ten years after it was devised by @entity13 ministers , e-borders is failing to meet most of its objectives , leaving a string of gaping holes in the protections it promised to deliver			2
some 70million passengers a year – one in three of the total – are arriving without undergoing background checks because of @entity25 data protection rules , inspectors found			1
shambles : the £ 1.2billion ' electronic borders ' system has failed to stop terrorists , foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into @entity7 , an official report reveals the report reveals : the report is the second in two months from chief inspector of borders and immigration @entity36 to have been heavily redacted by home secretary @entity38			1
the report is the second in two months from chief inspector of borders and immigration @entity36 ( pictured ) to have been heavily redacted by home secretary @entity38 some 39 paragraphs or entries were deleted , and four tables of figures , on the grounds that revealing them could undermine national security			1
but the raft of deletions will raise questions about whether embarrassing holes in border controls are being covered up			0
last night , @entity13 mp @entity53 , chairman of the @entity54 , said the e-borders programme had been a ‘ catastrophe for the @entity7 taxpayer ’			1
shadow home secretary @entity58 said it had ‘ ground to a halt causing serious failures in border security ’			1
however , senior officials insisted the number of passengers covered by e-borders was rising and set to grow even further in coming months			2
when the full plans for e-borders were drawn up in 2007 @entity13 ministers promised to ‘ export the border ’ to other countries by forcing anyone trying to get into @entity7 to reveal their personal information in advance			1
passed on by carriers , it is then checked against watch lists and security databases and logged on a vast database			0
extremists , criminals and wanted criminals could either be arrested at the airport or turned away			0
by the end of this year , 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by the system			2
but the report reveals just 65 per cent of journeys are covered			0
the @entity91 blew the most gaping hole in the system by ruling that it would breach free movement rules to force @entity25 citizens to hand their data over in advance			1
as a result , passengers arriving on flights from @entity100 can refuse to undergo advance screening			2
by the end of this year , 95 per cent of all journeys into the country were supposed to be covered by the system			2
however , the report reveals just 65 per cent of journeys are covered yesterday , sir @entity107 , the former @entity108 warship commander now in charge of @entity7 ’s borders , was bullish about the prospect for increasing coverage in the coming months			0
he indicated that a major @entity100 airline was about to sign up			0
he also said the system had allowed the arrest of thousands of criminals , including murderers and rapists			0
but mr @entity36 ’s report found this extension of police and security service capability was the only one of the eight main justifications for the project – which has already swallowed more than £ 500million of taxpayers ’ cash – to have been achieved			0
mr @entity36 heavily criticised the deletion of warnings about drugs and smuggled tobacco which was done to prioritise immigration work			0
immigration minister @entity133 said : ‘ passengers travelling to @entity7 are checked across a variety of databases before departure and upon arrival			1
‘ we now take @entity140 from 78 per cent of those travelling to the @entity7 by plane , and require this information from 100 per cent of those travelling from outside the @entity25			1
' we have the best coverage of any country in @entity100 but we are working to improve our coverage further			0

70million passengers a year are arriving in @entity7 without background checks
this is because of @entity25 data protection rules
e-borders system is supposed to stop terrorists , foreign criminals and illegal immigrants getting into @entity7
the system is unable to count **people** in and out , leaving officials in the dark about the true scale of illegal immigration .
**technical** **problems** mean **people** arriving on *ferries* , @entity170 trains , *cruise* ships and small planes are not screened in advance .
even when known criminals and illegals are *flagged* by the system , airports may not be phoned in advance to warn about their *impending* arrival .
nearly *650,000* @entity185 records about drugs and other contraband were deleted without even being read .
the system is not being used to track tax *fraudsters* and benefits cheats going on *holiday* because of **technical** **problems** .
*alerts* about criminals and illegal immigrants may be missed because staff start dealing with them then ‘ log off and go home ’ .
