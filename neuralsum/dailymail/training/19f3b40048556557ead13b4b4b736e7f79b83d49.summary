by @entity0 @entity1 has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay the welfare budget is to be capped at just under £ 120billion next year and will then rise only in line with inflation to stop the benefits bill spiralling out of control			1
as @entity11 seeks to make further benefit cuts a central election dividing line with @entity14 , mps will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts			1
from next year , the new limit will include housing benefit , tax credits , disability benefits and pensioner benefits , although the state pension and jobseeker ’s allowance will be excluded			1
governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what the chancellor describes as a ‘ limit on the nation ’s credit card ’			1
the conservatives and @entity37 @entity36 have agreed to cap welfare at £ 119.5billion next year , rising with forecast inflation to £ 126.7billion by 2018/19 – a real terms freeze in the next parliament			1
the chancellor is understood to want to go further and cut billions more from the welfare budget if the @entity44 remain in power after the next election			2
work and pensions secretary @entity1 has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay			1
he is currently rolling out the @entity50 – a major reform which aims to end the so - called dependency culture			0
the @entity53 says the welfare cap is designed to prevent repeats of the increase in incapacity benefit claims under the @entity59 governments of the 1980s and 1990s , and the surge in housing benefit under @entity14			1
it is also designed to try to bind @entity14 ’s hands by building structural limits into welfare which makes up a huge proportion of government spending			2
the @entity68 will introduce a law requiring a @entity71 vote to be held if the cap is breached and the government does not want to respond by cutting spending			1
an incoming @entity14 government would be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament , but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick it altogether			2
shadow chancellor @entity81 indicated last night that @entity14 would support the proposal – posing questions over which benefits it would cut to enable it to restore the spare room subsidy for council house tenants , a reform it calls a ‘ bedroom tax ’			1
reversing housing benefit reductions for tenants with unused rooms would mean a £ 465million welfare spending rise in 2015 - 16			1
@entity14 has said it would remove the winter fuel allowance from better - off pensioners , but this would save only £ 105million a year			2
mr @entity81 said : ‘ we ’ve supported the idea of a welfare cap , we ’ve said that we should keep out the basic pension but include pensioner benefits			1
clearly we ’ll do things differently from the government , for example we said we ’ll abolish the bedroom tax			2
as @entity11 seeks to make further benefit cuts a central election dividing line with @entity14 , mps will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts ‘ we actually think that our measures on housing and on young people and jobs can get the wider bill down			1
’ mr @entity11 said that under @entity14 spending on welfare was ‘ out of control ’ , with the number of people who have never worked doubling in a decade			2
he said the state pension was being excluded from the cap because it would not be right to hit ‘ those who ’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on , say , housing benefit for young people had got out of control ’			1
treasury sources said the inclusion of particular benefits in the cap did not rule out a political pledge to protect them			2
the @entity53 says the welfare cap is designed to prevent repeats of the increase in incapacity benefit claims under the @entity59 governments of the 1980s and 1990s , and the surge in housing benefit under @entity14 other benefits included in the cap and therefore potentially vulnerable to being cut back include incapacity benefits , carer ’s allowance , maternity allowance and employment support allowance			1
the @entity149 think tank the @entity150 welcomed the reform , but added : ‘ the chancellor should also look to increase the scope of the welfare cap and consider whether it really does need to rise in line with inflation			1
’ @entity159 , general secretary of the @entity160 , said : ‘ pensioners will be concerned that benefits such as the winter fuel allowance , cold weather payments and the @entity166 bonus have all been placed into the welfare cap , which could lead to cuts in the future			1

@entity173 , who is widely seen as the father of modern computing , was pivotal in cracking the @entity193 codes used by the @entity195 navy to send secret messages during the @entity197			0
with fellow codebreakers at @entity199 in @entity200 , he is credited with shortening the war by up to two years and saving countless lives			0
but in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship with a 19 - year - old @entity206 man			0
at that time homosexuality was illegal , and he chose to be chemically castrated with injections of female hormones rather than go to jail			0
the conviction meant that he lost his security clearance and had to stop the work that had proved vital to the @entity214			0
he died two years later , aged 41 , of cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide			0
he was granted a posthumous @entity217 in december after a request by justice minister @entity219 following a long campaign			0
at the time , @entity221 – who worked with the mathematician at @entity199 – said we could have lost the war had it not been for his work			0
she said : ‘ i really am very pleased			0
we knew the work he was doing at @entity199 was great			0
without him , we could have lost the war			0
