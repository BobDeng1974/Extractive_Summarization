by @entity0 he ’s a @entity1 mp who represents one of @entity5 ’s most diverse @entity4 electorates and @entity6 has pulled no punches today by stating he is very much ‘ pro-palestinian ’			1
in an interview with the @entity9 , he has not only made his support of the @entity12 plight in @entity13 very clear but has also urged his party to change ‘ alter its views ’			1
mr @entity6 ’s electorate of @entity17 in @entity4 is a diverse electorate , very much split along the lines of blue and white collar residents			1
it ranges from the affluent suburbs of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 in the city ’s inner west to @entity27 dominated areas of @entity29 and @entity30 in the western suburbs			1
he told the @entity9 that his constituents ( there is an 18 % @entity27 population in his area ) are complaining about his party ’s stance and often , suggesting that ‘ they feel we have been too quiet on it ( the war in @entity13 ) ’			1
mr @entity6 , who won the seat by a slender margin over his @entity51 counterpart at the 2013 federal poll , also took a swipe at @entity51 mp @entity54 , for choosing the end of the holy month of @entity56 to criticise @entity57 but claims @entity5 ’s influential role within the @entity60 @entity59 should be used to find an answer to the ongoing territorial battle between the @entity12 and @entity57			2
smoke billows from a building after an @entity57 attack on a northern @entity13 neighbourhood			2

@entity12 @entity74 supporters take to the streets , chanting anti-israel slogans			0
the federal member for @entity17 says both parties of guilty of ‘ paying lip service ’ to a possible resolution			0
he is a staunch supporter of a ‘ two - state solution ’			0
while mr @entity6 is the only one to have spoken publicly , he does have some support from within but other @entity1 mps have , so far , refused to be named			2
one senior mp , however , has also admitted @entity51 was ‘ outplaying ’ the @entity1 on the issue			0
on the issue of statehood , mr @entity6 says it ’s time that @entity5 joined forces with a growing number of representatives within the @entity60 who are now voting ‘ yes ’ with @entity93 .			0

@entity85 claims he *'s* facing a *backlash* from the @entity27 population in @entity4
wants his @entity1 colleagues to change their ' long - held views ' on the battle in @entity13
politicians are hiding ' behind words ' and not taking action
