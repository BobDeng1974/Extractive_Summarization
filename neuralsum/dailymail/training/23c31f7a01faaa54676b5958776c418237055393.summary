@entity0 was described as a gift to @entity3 campaign after upsetting voters by describing @entity5 as ' huge chunk of territory ' @entity0 ’s visit to @entity5 yesterday to campaign for the @entity10 will have persuaded voters to back independence , @entity8 claimed last night			1
the first minister said the @entity15 leader joining the campaign trail in @entity17 to ask @entity5 to vote no was a gift to the @entity3 campaign			1
mr @entity0 said that he had gone there to win back @entity21 supporters who had decided to vote for independence			1
but before he had even arrived he had upset @entity5 by describing @entity5 as ‘ a large chunk of our territory ’			1
mr @entity8 , who was campaigning in @entity26 , said mr @entity0 was as an asset to the @entity3 camp			1
the @entity30 leader said there is ‘ huge disillusionment with the @entity36 system ’ and that extended to @entity15 ’s ‘ negative , insular , anti-european brand of politics ’			1
he added : ‘ a lot of people in @entity5 have no time for that and therefore mr @entity0 is a rival to @entity5 and will be an asset to the @entity3 campaign , and a huge embarrassment of course to the no campaign			1
’ at a @entity15 rally in @entity17 last night , mr @entity0 said the prime minister had been ‘ moronic ’ for not putting the option of maximum devolution on the ballot paper along with @entity3 and no. he said : ‘ i was astonished that the prime minister allowed for the separatists to be given the “ yes ” side of the referendum question			1
‘ but no , on this he blundered and more fundamentally he blundered by not offering the @entity5 people , the “ devo max ” option			1
’ earlier , mr @entity0 had suggested the @entity63 has a responsibility to speak out and tell @entity5 to vote against independence			1
the first minister described the @entity15 leader 's visit as a gift to his campaign , describing @entity0 as a ' rival ' of @entity5 and therefore an ' asset ' to his crusade he told radio station @entity74 : ‘ my understanding of the constitution is if the kingdom itself , if the @entity59 itself is under threat , then in many ways you could argue she has a responsibility to say something			1
‘ let ’s say we got to this sunday and let ’s say it was still 50 - 50 in the polls , i personally think she should say something , yes			0
’ he said @entity94 people were feeling ‘ ignored ’ in the independence debate and argued that the strengthening of the devolution settlement offered by @entity98 parties in the event of a no vote should apply to other parts of the @entity59 , as well as @entity5			1
last night 60 demonstrators gathered outside the @entity15 rally and mr @entity0 was smuggled in a side door to avoid them			1
it overshadowed an event held by @entity21 last night , which saw party leader @entity108 share a platform with former prime minister @entity110 for the first time since he left @entity112 in 2010			1
@entity21 peer @entity113 last night said : ‘ @entity0 ’s intervention is counter-productive			2
‘ as always , his ego comes before the cause			0
’ friday night in a @entity17 distillery ... were we in for a bit of a stooshie ? @entity122 in @entity5 @entity17 city centre of a friday night			2
not exactly quiet pint territory at the best of times			2
so the arrival of @entity0 – that personification of cocky @entity128 – with a blunt message for the @entity5 could reasonably be expected to generate more heat than light			1
we were probably in for what locals like to call a bit of a stooshie			0
a couple of van loads of police were not taking chances			0
one or two mouthier onlookers were carted off			0
when the @entity15 leader came to @entity144 on the @entity146 campaign trail , he was famously set upon by a mob who forced him to seek refuge in a pub. last night , he had pre-empted a repeat by booking an entire distillery in advance			1
arriving in a big , blacked - out limo , he stepped straight through a back door while a few dozen general - purpose ‘ activists ’ gathered at the front			0
for his trip to @entity5 , the @entity15 leader had dropped his fag - and - a - pint - of - your - finest routine the teacher building has not actually produced any whisky since becoming a chi - chi downtown conference centre in 1991			1
but it still boasts peaty old names like the @entity168 and the @entity169			0
of anything resembling a bar , though , there was no sign			0
but mr @entity0 had dropped the fag - and - a - pint - of - your - finest routine for this trip			2
when it comes to his taste in drink and tobacco , he is much closer to @entity181 than any other party leader , but his cheeky city trader schtick has very limited appeal north of the border			2
so , after a rumbustious tour of the @entity188 radio studios at breakfast time , he came to @entity17 last night with an uncharacteristically sombre speech			0
there were few of the usual barbs at @entity194 bogeymen like @entity195			0
he was n’t even particularly rude about @entity8			2
he was selling a ‘ pig in a poke ’ and all that			0
@entity198 had been as ‘ arrogant as @entity199 at @entity200 ’ in letting mr @entity8 dictate the terms of this referendum			2
but his central message was that if @entity5 wanted to control their own destiny , then becoming a ‘ small and pretty irrelevant province ’ of a @entity207 - controlled @entity206 was not the answer			2
this rally of 100 activists even heard a pat on the back for the @entity213 ( in contrast to an earlier speaker ’s fiery denunciation of the @entity30 as @entity213 - supporting ‘ @entity217 ’ )			0
‘ i absolutely hold no brief for @entity219 but at least there is a consistency to his nationalism			0
he does n’t want @entity223 to be part of the @entity59 , but neither does he want the island of @entity223 to be governed by the bureaucrats of @entity227 , ’ he said sternly			0
‘ what @entity8 is offering is n’t nationalism on a @entity5 level , it is supra - nationalism on an @entity206 level			1
’ eh , pal ? deep waters for a friday night			0
the @entity236 would never ever underwrite a @entity5 currency , mr @entity0 avowed			1
the @entity94 would never buy it			0
he finished not with a warning , though , but an outstretched hand : ‘ it ’s your @entity10 , too			0
’ outside , there was a weird absence of either @entity3 or no camps			2
the latter had wanted nothing to do with mr @entity0			2
on the basis of ‘ my enemy ’s enemy is my friend ’ , the @entity3 movement were happy to leave him to it			2
with 140,000 votes in the @entity194 elections , @entity15 now has a @entity5 mep , a roly - poly , openly gay freight boss called @entity257			1
he led the warm - up with a fabulously off - message press conference			0
by his own admission , his head was somewhat clogged by a streaming cold			0
@entity265 ? ‘ he is doing a good job for his country			0
’ @entity266 was all the @entity206 ’s fault			0
asked about @entity15 ’s appeal to women voters in this referendum campaign , mr @entity257 replied : ‘ speaking as a homosexual , i suppose i could give them fashion tips – or advice on their drapery			1
’ for all @entity15 ’s bluster about ‘ @entity279 ’ as a ‘ pivotal moment ’ in this campaign , it was not			1
it will probably go down as a footnote			0
but it was different .			0
