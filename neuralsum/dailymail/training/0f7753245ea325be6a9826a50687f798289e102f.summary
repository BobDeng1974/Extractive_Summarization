the parents of a baby who was born without eyes are hopeful their son will one day be able to see			1
staff at @entity6 's @entity5 initially thought baby @entity8 's face was swollen at birth			1
but they were stunned to discover the reason his eyelids would not open was because he did not have eyes - an extremely rare condition called @entity16			1
a mri scan 13 days later showed that he had been born without eyes			1
she told @entity28 that it was a traumatic discovery and ' by the time we left , i think every single nurse had cried with us			0
' but she and her husband , who are from @entity34 , @entity6 , are optimistic that science will progress enough to help @entity8 , who does have an optic nerve , see in his lifetime			1
the three - month - old had surgery to be fitted with expanders in his sockets , so that they will grow enough to hold a prosthetic eyeball in the future			0
the three - month - old had been fitted with expanders to allow his sockets to grow , but he rubbed them out however , at present the baby only has one expander in place			1
both expanders fell out after @entity8 rubbed his eyes and mrs @entity22 was only able to replace one			1
she described her husband 's encouragement as he held their son while she struggled to insert the expander , adding : ' i got it in and then i just cried '			2
mrs @entity22 said : ' i do hold out hope			0
i know that researchers are testing it and doing what they can , but i do hope that , one day , they 'll be able to grow an eye or transplant an eye			0
' but for now , the couple are helping their son with special toys and development programs			0
his mother @entity72 revealed how she struggled to put one back in and added she is hopeful he will one day see @entity16 is a medical term that means an absence of the eye - and a child may be born with one , or both eyes , missing from the eye socket			1
the terms @entity16 and @entity82 ( small eyes ) are often used interchangeably since ct scans or @entity84 show some remnants of either the globe or surrounding tissue in most cases			2
the condition is extremely rare and a report from a prospective study of 50,000 newborns found an incidence of microphthalmia of 0.22 per 1,000 live births			0
in a recent study in @entity98 , the prevalence of @entity16 and @entity82 was one per 10,000 births			0
it is not known exactly what makes @entity16 occur , but it is likely due to a disruption in the sequence of developmental steps that take place when the eye is forming during pregnancy			0
they may result from inherited genetic mutations , sporadic genetic mutations , chromosome abnormalities , prenatal environmental insult or other unknown factors			0
unfortunately , there is no treatment that will restore vision in children affected by @entity16 and they need to undergo repeated hospital visits			2
many have prosthetic eyes to ensure that the bone and soft tissue around the eye socket grows properly and to improve appearance			2
