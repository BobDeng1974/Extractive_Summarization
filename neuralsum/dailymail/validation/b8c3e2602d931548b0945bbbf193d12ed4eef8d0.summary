a blind sled dog named @entity1 is never far from his brother @entity2 , who for years has acted as his sight on the trails in @entity6			1
now that the @entity9 husky brothers are nearing age 10 , @entity7 is looking to retire them and hope to send the two inseparable friends to the same family			1
both @entity1 and @entity2 were born with sight but in 2010 , trainers started to realize @entity1 was losing his sight when he started tripping over his food			2
inseparable : blind sled dog @entity1 ( left ) is currently up for adoption with his brother @entity2 ( right ) , who has been acting as his sight on the trails for years			1
both are currently up for adoption , and their rescue center hopes to find them a home where they can live together when his blindness was initially diagnosed , a veterinarian urged his owners to keep him on the sled dog team , and that 's when @entity2 stepped up to the plate			1
' at first it kind of upset him ( @entity2 ) because it slightly hindered his ability to run straight because @entity1 was leaning up against him , ' musher @entity30 told @entity33			0
' over time , @entity2 kind of realized he was the only thing keeping his brother on the trail			2
he started to help him			0
if there was a left turn coming up or a right turn , he 'd pull him this way or nudge him that way and do whatever he had to do to make sure he ( @entity1 ) did n't run off the trail or anything like that , ' @entity30 said			0
on the off occasion that @entity1 has run off the trail , @entity2 has picked him up out of ditches by dragging him by the collar			2
a dog 's seeing eye dog : @entity1 's sight first started failing in 2010 , but his brother @entity2 stepped in and helped direct him on sled dog runs			1
@entity2 ( left ) and @entity1 ( right ) pictured above in 2013 runners : for years the brothers ran with @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity6 giving tours in the winter months ' i 've run dogs in a lot of places , all over the country , and it was the most amazing thing i 've ever seen sled dogs do , ' musher @entity59 told the @entity67 in 2013			1
while the reliance on @entity2 worked for several years , @entity1 eventually had to quit sled running this fall , when a doctor removed the other eye that was giving him limited sight			2
since then he has become quite accustomed to life as an office dog while his brother continues to exercise with the other 131 dogs at the no - kill shelter			0
