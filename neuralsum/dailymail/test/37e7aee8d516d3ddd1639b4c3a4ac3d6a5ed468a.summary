if you live in the @entity1 or @entity2 you can expect to have already been hacked – at least according to the real life conman turned fraud prevention expert whose escapades inspired @entity5			1
@entity9 , whose early life on the run from the @entity12 was brought to life on the screen by @entity15 , has said the public is underestimating the extent that their details have been stolen by digital fraudsters , the @entity8 reported			1
in the 2002 @entity22 film @entity9 , now 66 , poses as a doctor , a lecturer , a lawyer and an airline pilot over the course of a crime spree that eventually landed him in prison			1
he was played by @entity15 ( right ) in the film about his misspent youth as a conman however the former conman changed his ways and has spent the rest of his career working with the @entity12 on fraud detection and prevention			1
in an interview mr @entity9 told of how in an age of information overload , those of us living in the western world have probably already had our identities stolen			1
he highlighted the recent theft of details from more than 80 million @entity2 whose names , dates of birth , children ’s details and and social security numbers were held by the @entity2 underwriter anthem insurance			2
he added that there had been so many similar incidents in recent years that societies should just assume personal information had been stolen			1
mr @entity9 works as a consultant to @entity1 company @entity65 and has written three books on the nature of fraud			1
he has called the constant effort by security companies to stay ahead of hackers a ‘ battle ’ , saying it is always necessary to be thinking a move ahead of the fraudsters			0
@entity9 , as is depitced in the 2002 film @entity5 , posed at one point as a senior medical doctor the conman turned fraud expert also travelled the globe posing as an international airline pilot for @entity83 mr @entity9 exaplained that while he used ink and paper to fraudulently access money , the scope for internet fraud is greater and easier for hackers a survey by the digital consultancy @entity91 shows one in four @entity1 know they have had their identities stolen			1
in 43 percent of those incidents the ensuing difficulties took more than a month to rectify			0
forty - seven percent said they had to pay money to resolve the problems			0
of these , 28 percent had to pay at least £ 60			0
mr @entity9 explained these kinds of cases were not the work of some mastermind fraudster but more often than not down to employees simply not following proper procedure			2
details can be lost when individuals download work files at home , insert unknown memory sticks into work terminals or open attachments on untrustworthy emails			2
because fraudsters will sit on stolen information for drawn - out periods of time , people are normally hacked two or three years before their identity is stolen			2
however the typical reaction is to assume the theft is recent , @entity9 explained			1
the tools of his trade were pen , paper and charm but mr @entity9 says what he did 50 years ago as a teenaged boy is now ‘ a thousand times easier , ’ adding that changes in technology always open the door to crime			1
as a prime example he explained that to forge a cheque in the 1960s required a special printing press			0
now a coporate logo and a managing director ’s signature can all be found on the web at the click of a button			0
typically @entity9 will drop memory sticks with the word ' @entity143 ' written on them on the floor of a new client ’s offices			2
inevitably they will be picked up by an unwitting employee and placed in a work computer , allowing the bug he has placed on it to enter the system			0
@entity9 worked as a fraudster during his teenaged years in the 1960s - he now deeply regrets it @entity155 has become one of the world ’s foremost authorities on forgery and secure documents			1
he has worked with the @entity12 , hundreds of financial intitutions and corporations and international government agencies			2
as well as the 2002 @entity22 film made about his life , a @entity165 musical also called @entity5 opened on broadway in april 2011			1
between the ages of 16 and 21 , he successfully posed as an airline pilot , an attorney , a college professor and a paediatrician			0
while doing so he cashed $ 2.5 million in fraudulent checks in every @entity2 state and 26 foreign countries apprehended by the @entity178 police when he was 21 years old , he served time in the @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity2 prison systems			0
after five years he was released on the condition that he would help the @entity2 federal government without remuneration			0
more than 14,000 financial institutions , corporations and law enforcement agencies now use his fraud prevention programs			0
he said the amount of money lost to fraud was ‘ beyond the imagination ’			0
@entity192 , mr @entity9 said , and @entity193 , the two @entity2 healthcare assistance programmes , pay out more than $ 100 billion in fraudulent claims every year			2
the conman turned @entity12 consultant insists he is not proud of his youthful adventures and said he regretted the @entity22 film			1
however he said he has paid back society with interest			0
$ 2 milllion of the $ 2.5 million he took was recovered by the @entity202 and he has spent 40 years helping catch criminals			0
he stole $ 2.5 million dollars , $ 2 million of which was recovered			0
mr @entity9 then spent 40 years working with the @entity12			1
