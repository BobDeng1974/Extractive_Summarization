it 's the tv show that 's taken the nation by storm , as much for its action packed fight scenes and historical storytelling , as its hunky lead actors including former @entity8 model @entity7			1
but while audiences are swooning over @entity14 's shirtless , shield - wielding stars , the @entity11 model - turned - actor says he does n't think the show 's sexiness has been crucial to its success			1
the actor instead credits the tv series ' loyal following to good quality scripts , story lines and lovable characters			1
his billboard posters were said to have caused traffic pile - ups in @entity36 , while the then 23 - year - old became the first male model to be signed exclusively by @entity8 for an entire year , earning him a six - figure sum talking to @entity40 , @entity7 , who shot to fame as the face of @entity8 's lauded men 's underwear range in 2002 , said it was both the pilot episode and historically accurate scripts that first piqued his interest in @entity23			1
he said : ' [ writer ] @entity27 is a very talented guy and i wanted to work with him			2
' i did n’t know that much about it , i knew as much as anybody else that the @entity23 raped and pillaged , but @entity27 ’s writing , you ca n’t help but learn from it			1
' the star did admit however , that historical fact alone is n't always enough to capture the full attention of today 's audience			1
former @entity11 model @entity7 has won over viewers as legendary viking leader @entity61 , the star of @entity14 's action - packed historical drama series @entity23 , which is now in its third series despite claiming to not care for the sexier elements of the show , @entity7 has won himself a legion of loyal admirers for his portrayal of farm - hand turned viking warrior king @entity61 from the non-stop raunch of @entity75 to the topless @entity77 scenes in @entity79 's new period drama remake of @entity80 , there 's no denying today 's batch of historically based shows are reeling in viewers by upping the sex factor			1
but @entity7 , who plays @entity61 , the main character in the action - packed programme , insists there 's more to @entity23 than just bare brawn			1
he said : ' i guess for some people maybe it has to [ be sexy ] , but we ’re making an adventure out of it and it 's exciting for the audience - and it ’s very informative			2
on - screen brothers @entity7 ( pictured right ) and @entity98 ( pictured left as @entity23 character @entity99 ) have helped to revolutionise the reputation of historical television shows and period dramas once thought to be slow and staid , there 's now a new breed of period drama packed with action , violence , drama , sex and heartthrobs , breathing new life into the telling of stories steeped in true historical fact ' it ’s hard to make people want to learn i guess , but @entity27 ’s done a great job of making a good story out it and the family saga			1
' previously known for his long hair , perfectly groomed appearance , six - pack and bulging underpants , the actor even told us he 's past caring what he looks like onscreen			1
' i do n’t give a s * * * about that			2
we ’ve got a whole team to make us look good			2
' once known for his six - pack and bulging @entity8 underpants , @entity7 says he no longer cares what he looks like onscreen , championing the brilliant @entity23 script over the show 's flesh flashing for @entity7 , the real challenge of his role , which is based on the life of historical figure and renowned viking @entity61 , a ruler named in sagas and @entity144 poetry , was endearing his ruthless character to the viewers			1
he said : ' i sort of respect him you know , a person who started in the farm and became a king , and a well known figure in history , it ’s pretty amazing what @entity61 achieved			2
' but we do some heinous things , so it ’s a lot of work to make the audience still follow you even though you have done some pretty horrible stuff			2
' new series @entity162 begins next month , set in @entity164 after the @entity165 and based on the best - selling books by @entity36 writer @entity167			1
while early reviews suggest there will be far less nudity than @entity172 , it 's set to feature plenty of drama and some stirring romance but while @entity23 is currently airing its second series on @entity14 , there 's yet another new drama spicing up the history pages			1
outlander launches 26 march on @entity183 rival service @entity181 , taking its cue from @entity172 by mixing action and epic fantasy with brooding characters and sexual tension			1
can it rival the current offering ? between 's @entity196 's naked @entity80 scenes , the bulging biceps of @entity23 and the soon to start fifth season of @entity194 's @entity172 , there 's a lot of hot history to contend with ! vikings , @entity199 is on history tomorrow at 10pm @entity79 's new tv period drama @entity80 , a remake of the 1970s hit television show , has been accused of flaunting male lead @entity77 in topless promotional shots and nude scenes to lure in more viewers @entity194 's medieval fantasy epic @entity172 features adult scenes plus both partial and full - frontal nudity in almost every episode , making it one of the raunchiest box - sets on @entity213 roast boar might have been the @entity23 ' party food of choice but venison was almost as popular , as @entity219 's delicious recipe proves			1
