in the sting it was alleged the @entity4 made indiscreet , and often rude , references to the late @entity37 , the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 and @entity41 during a lengthy conversation @entity24 , who said he wanted to hire her pr firm			1
the ' @entity45 ' captured her apparently saying @entity46 as being ' far too presidential ' - while @entity40 was ' just horrid			1
absolutely horrid , horrid , horrid '			2
she is also said to have referred to the @entity15 as ' the old dear '			1
the @entity4 is further alleged to have told the bogus sheik that @entity49 and @entity50 will marry - but not until ' the old lady dies '			1
in this instance , the @entity4 was referring to the @entity38			2
ms @entity17 today described how the investigation into royal access for business was blown when the letters leaked out			0
she said @entity57 had forced the @entity4 to do an exclusive interview with @entity22 if they dropped the embarrassing story			1
evidence : former news international chief executive @entity17 told the @entity19 today about her deal with the royals after the @entity4 made disparaging comments she said a former ' disgruntled ' employee had approached the newspaper alleging that the countess and her business partner were using the royal connection to boost their business			1
the journalist set about posing as a @entity24 in need of @entity31 at a huge cost to the @entity22 ( @entity8 ) , the court was told			1
there was laughter in the courtroom when @entity80 said : ' he would live the true life of a wealthy @entity24			2
he would have a @entity82 and a penthouse suite			0
he always told me it was imperative			0
' apology : the @entity4 in 2001 on the day after it emerged she make ' indiscreet ' remarks to the @entity24 about fellow royals and politicians after the lengthy investigation , @entity80 was presented with the results and she concluded that although it complied with the editors ' code of conduct from the start , it had not proved the allegation that the @entity4 had personally offered access			1
@entity80 decided not to run the story and instead rang @entity57 to make a deal			1
an agreement was struck for an interview with @entity20 in exchange for dumping the @entity24 story			1
it was the first interview since her marriage so a good deal for the paper , she said			0
she told the court : ' in the meantime , the @entity4 , having been told by us , had realised that during the course of trying to get @entity114 as a client she had been horribly indiscreet about members of the royal family and politicians and obviously remembered what she said			2
' so she wrote to everybody involved			0
she was particularly mean about @entity46 and @entity40 , @entity41 , so she wrote these letters			2
' but the letters leaked out and ' became a justification for running the original story ' although it was more about the embarrassing remarks , she told the court			0
a story about the letters also appeared in the @entity131			0
her comments were not read to the court today but were widely reported at the time			0
@entity80 told the jury : ' the time in which i approached the palace and negotiated the interview and then did the interview , as the @entity4 is writing letters , it is being discussed in the palace , what had happened			1
' i 'm assuming someone from the palace leaked this to the @entity131 , but that 's an assumption			0
if it was us and the palace that knew			0
' afterwards , @entity80 wrote to the head of the investigations unit , @entity153 , saying : ' we have got to learn some lessons from @entity20			2
' as i said , all our entrapment and subterfuge must be justified 110 per cent			0
we have to ( sic ) so careful and make sure everything we do is inside the law			0
' i know @entity20 was 110 % justified in every way and our methods were right and proper			2
we must continue this standard with all our investigations			0
' asked why she would have sent that email , @entity80 told the court that there had been ' a lot of things said ' about the operation that were not true			0
she said : ' because i had had particular involvement in this , i was quite cross because i felt that at every stage in the @entity4 investigation we had adhered to the code and used the public interest exceptions and had behaved responsibly on the actual final decision , did we have enough of a story ? ' the trial continues			2
