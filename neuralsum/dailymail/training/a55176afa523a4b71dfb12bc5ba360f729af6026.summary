by @entity0 published : 19:07 est , 20 november 2012 updated : 16:14 est , 21 november 2012 ministers have pledged to close a ‘ nonsense ’ anomaly that has seen more than 5,000 children – some as you as 11 – banned from driving even though they are not yet old enough to legally drive			1
alerted to the scandal exposed by their own figures , @entity6 promised to act to crack down on what they admit is a serious threat to road safety			0
in total some 5,333 under - age driving offenders have been ‘ banned ’ from driving since 2009 - including five 11 - year - olds - analysis of @entity17 figures obtained from a @entity19 request to the @entity20 by motoring magazine @entity21			1
@entity23 figures : more than 5,000 under - age offenders have been banned from driving since 2009 ( posed by model ) presented with the alarming data by @entity28 , justice secretary @entity26 said : ‘ this strikes me as a nonsense and i will be talking to my colleagues at the @entity32 about this			1
’ roads safety minister @entity34 said : ‘ i agree that this sounds like nonsense and an anomaly			1
i will be looking at this urgently			0
‘ we are fully committed to keeping @entity41 ’s roads among the safest in the world and this means taking a tough line on anyone who breaks the law regardless of age			1
‘ young drivers already face sanctions – under current legislation disqualifications are endorsable offences , which means points can be carried onto provisional licences and used by courts under the totting up system for future bans			0
anomaly : more than 5,000 children have been banned from driving for motor offences before the age of 18 ( picture posed by model ) ‘ i will take a careful look at circumstances where very young drivers whose points or disqualifications have become spent before they are eligible to drive to make sure they are effectively dealt with			1
’ nonsense ' : justice secretary @entity26 said he would be talking to the @entity68 about the ' anomaly ' the @entity70 said the law must be changed so that most serious and prolific offenders should face an extended driving test and be subject to social reports before they can take their first test			1
and offenders banned for a period that goes over their 17th birthday should not be eligible to take the test			2
@entity70 spokesman @entity80 said : ‘ it is good that the government has been stirred to look at this			0
‘ i think the average motorist will be horrified by these figures			0
motoring lawlessness is a real problem in this country , thankfully only a small minority of young people behave in this way			0
’ for the future he stressed : ’ prolific and repeat child offenders should have these offences etched into their driving record and have them taken into account should they ever commit an offence after the age of 17			2
‘ the most serious offenders should face an extended driving test and be subject to social reports before they can take a proper test at 17			0
and offenders banned for a period that goes over their 17th birthday should not be eligible to have a licence unless they too take an extended test with social reports			2
’ mr @entity80 added : ‘ it might be better for the original under - age bans to be suspended and subject to being re-invoked – but not automatically – if the they re-offend after the age of 17			2
’ the @entity112 confirmed that currently young people convicted of driving offences will be subject to penalty points and disqualification even if they are not yet old enough to hold a driving licence , and that the bans come into force from the time they are imposed by a court , rather than from the age when the offender reaches driving age .			0
