but a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be on the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply			2
now , some distillers have taken heed of the warnings and are coming up with radical new ways to mature whiskey to its full potential faster than ever before			1
whiskey lovers all over the world will tell you the key to the perfect bourbon is time			1
but a catastrophic shortage of whiskey could soon be the way with anecdotal reports suggesting the demand for bourbon is about to outstrip supply according to a report by @entity22 in @entity23 , the popularity of bourbon last year saw 19 million cases sold , generating $ 2.7 billion in revenue			2
she claims that through a series of inventive ageing methods , manufacturers have been able to cut the two - to - 20 - year process into just days and months			1
the ageing of whiskey usually takes place in 200 - litres ( 53 @entity36 gallons ) barrels made from seasoned @entity36 white oak , @entity38			1
these barrels are charred , breaking down the lignin in the wood into compounds called aldehydes			2
adding alcohol to the barrel causes oxidation which transforms the aldehydes into acids			2
changes in heat within the barrel then give whiskey its complex flavour			2
through a series of inventive ageing methods , manufacturers have been able to cut the two - to - 20 - year process whiskey ageing process into just days and months @entity23 reports that @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60 - the makers of @entity57 – are now letting the alcohol settle in 2 - to 5 - gallon oak barrels			1
this , they say , increases the alcohol - to - barrel - surface ratio , causing the whiskey to mature faster , cutting the time down to around four months			1
meanwhile @entity67 in @entity68 is adding toasted oak chips their barrel , in another attempt to increase the alcohol - to - surface ratio			2
one distillery in @entity74 claims it has cut the process down to just eight hours			1
@entity76 , near @entity77 , first filters the whiskey in plastic tanks			2
there are concerns that pubs could become a thing of the past as thousands close each year due to spiralling production costs			0
but a new machine could help landlords feeling the pinch , because it can produce pints that cost just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each			0
the @entity91 can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button			0
a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine is intended for business use and will cost around £ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 )			0
the machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery			0
the machine is filled it with water , and then ingredients including hops are placed inside			0
it 's then switched on for two hours			0
the machine is self - cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later			0
this speeds up the aldehyde and acid reaction creating chemical compounds that can be consumed in a matter of hours			1
entrepreneurs have also created home tools for people to fake the taste of aged whisky			0
a wooden tool called ' @entity119 , ' which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours			1
the oak sticks are specially designed to ' age ' the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whiskey with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples			1
the sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the liquid			0
they are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple			0
whether or not these fast - @entity57 's live up to the taste test remains to be seen			0
the sticks ( pictured ) have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the @entity144 are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive bottle			1
the oak is cut horizontally to allow ‘ accelerated transpiration through capillary action '			0

@entity58 is now letting the alcohol settle in 2 gallon barrels
this , they say , cuts the time to mature the drink to just four months
distillery in @entity74 claims it has cut the process to eight hours
they first filter the whiskey to speed up the aldehyde and acid reaction
