‘ the officer was concerned at @entity16 ’s behaviour in the rear passenger seat as she was kicking out forcefully at the window , causing the glass to bulge outwards			2
‘ the sergeant opened the door and tried to pile on top of the defendant to stop her kicking , but @entity16 managed to get her legs in the air , pulled them back and kicked the officer three or four times in the face			2
the officer suffered reddening and slight discomfort to her face			0
the prosecutor said : ‘ mr @entity8 says he lost confidence after the attack			2
he was still working at the bar , but would leave if he could afford it			0
he had had ambitions to progress to management , but no longer wanted to do that			0
' he was extremely shaken up by what happened , had had nightmares and had to take leave from his full - time job because the injury was noticeable and he felt everybody was staring at him and making a judgement			0

@entity149 , defending , said : ‘ the night of this incident was the anniversary of her deceased father ’s birthday			0
it ’s not an excuse , but it may explain the condition she got herself into			0
‘ her two great ambitions in life are to have work and to have a home			0
custody would inevitably mean the loss of both of these			0
’ miss @entity149 told the hearing there had been no further incidents of drunkenness or drunken violence in the six months since , and that @entity16 ’s remorse was genuine			1
she added : ‘ there is a clear link between alcohol use and her offending behaviour			0
’ the judge mr recorder @entity177 , @entity178 , told @entity16 : ‘ what you did , you know , was completely disgraceful			2
you have a previous conviction for assaulting a police officer and apparently took some delight in doing so			0
