@entity0 has the @entity2 seniors heading to @entity3 - and now the youth team fancy a bit of cup glory as well			1
a double from @entity7 and another from @entity8 powered @entity2 to a deserved win over @entity10 and set up a sixth round trip to @entity12 in the @entity13			1
with a @entity16 final with @entity17 to look forward to , plus the warm memories of saturday ’s @entity20 heroics against @entity21 , these are good times to be a @entity2 fan and the feel - good factor has spread to the club ’s academy too			1
@entity2 's youth side beat @entity10 3 - 1 to reach the sixth round of the @entity13 @entity8 ( right ) continued his impressive form in the tournament with a goal in the victory @entity8 ( left ) slots past @entity10 goalkeeper @entity33 ( centre ) to score for @entity2 @entity2 : @entity35 ; @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 , @entity7 , @entity41 ( @entity42 81 ) ; @entity43 ( @entity44 77 ) , @entity45 ( c ) , @entity8 ( @entity46 72 ) substitutes not used : @entity47 ( gk ) ; loft scorers : @entity7 19 , 70 ; @entity8 61 booked : @entity36 - @entity36 @entity10 : @entity33 ; @entity50 , @entity51 ( c ) , @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 ( @entity59 71 ) ; @entity60 substitutes not used : @entity61 ( gk ) ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 scorer : @entity60 25 booked : @entity60 referee : @entity67 they were simply too strong for their visitors and undeterred when @entity60 ’s brilliant free - kick drew @entity10 level midway through the first - half			1
taking complete command after the break , they found the necessary goals to prove their superiority and reached the last eight with plenty in reserve			0
this was arguably the stand - out tie of the fifth round , with both @entity2 and @entity10 having designs on winning the competition for the fourth and 11th times respectively , and it was rightly given the grand old stage of @entity89			1
spurs had defeated @entity91 and @entity92 to reach this stage , while @entity10 had seen off @entity94 and @entity95			2
a win here and both could realistically start thinking about lifting the trophy			0
despite this , the game started at a slow pace and it was the quarter - hour before either side had a sniff of goal			0
the lively @entity8 , who scored a hat - trick for @entity2 in the third round and another goal in the fourth , floated in a cross from the right and @entity39 beat keeper @entity33 in the air , only to see his header drop wide of the post			1
but they had their reward shortly afterwards and @entity117 youth international @entity8 was involved again			2
this time he swung in a testing low corner that @entity37 flicked on at the near post and @entity7 tapped in from a couple of yards out			2
@entity7 , a @entity121 youth player , is a regular scorer for the under 18 side but it ’s doubtful he ’ll have too many simpler chances than this as @entity10 ’s defence dozed			1
their funk was short - lived , however , and the visitors drew level five minutes later in spectacular fashion			0
@entity50 was clipped about 30 yards from goal and @entity60 , sizing up the situation , had no other thought but to shoot			0
he produced a vicious shot of pace and dip that was perfectly placed to beat the outstretched glove of @entity35 and land in the bottom corner			0
the @entity141 - born frontman , 17 , made a name for himself in this competition last season and is clearly up for the @entity13 again			2
slowly , @entity10 clicked into the passing rhythm that is the hallmark of all their sides at all age groups and @entity57 , who scored twice against @entity95 , came close with a curling effort after @entity58 had beaten two defenders on the right			1
at the other end , @entity33 dived low to his left to keep out @entity43 ’s effort following a purposeful run through the middle			0
@entity7 ( centre ) was at the double for @entity2 as they advanced in the competition @entity2 's @entity43 ( right ) was denied a goal with a good save from @entity10 goalkeeper @entity33 @entity8 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity2 manager @entity164 ( right ) after being substituted @entity10 had the ball in the net on their first attack of the second - half ; @entity170 playing a one - two with @entity171 inside the box before finishing , but celebrations were cut short by the linesman ’s flag			1
these fine margins counted against @entity10 and within seconds they were behind again			2
@entity45 had the presence of mind to spot the unmarked @entity8 wide on the left and he had ample time to compose himself before lifting the ball over @entity33			2
suddenly , the game was stretched and @entity10 captain @entity51 stuck out a leg to stop @entity43 ’s goalbound shot on the turn , before @entity50 rampaged down the wing to draw a sharp save from @entity35			0
with 20 minutes left , @entity2 took full control when @entity188 sprung @entity7 clear down the right			1
his pace was too hot for @entity53 and the @entity2 man closed in before poking the ball between the legs of @entity33 for his second of the evening			0
it proved the game - killer			0
spurs are on the march in a @entity13 competition once again .			0

@entity2 win *emphatically* over @entity10 in @entity13
@entity7 scored a double and @entity8 got the other
@entity2 will take on @entity12 in the sixth round
