it is a mammoth deal that secures his status as @entity4 's talisman for many years to come			1
@entity6 , at the age of 20 , is about to put pen to paper on a staggering contract worth £ 25million over the next five years			1
but where does the @entity11 star rank among the hottest young properties in the big @entity15 leagues ? we count down our top 10			2
@entity18 ( @entity19 and @entity20 ) the most experienced member of our list , @entity21 was barely out of school when he started playing in the @entity25 with @entity26			0
a move to @entity19 proved a springboard for the 20 - year - old left - back and he is now a regular for the @entity20 national team too			2
indeed , at 18 years and 71 days , he was the youngest player ever to feature at a @entity32 finals in 2012			0
willems in action for @entity20 in a recent @entity36 qualifier with @entity37 in @entity38 9			0
@entity39 ( @entity40 and @entity41 ) the latest absurdly talented attacking midfielder to come along the @entity44 conveyor belt , @entity39 has inevitably drawn comparisons with @entity46			0
the @entity40 man , 19 , credits the close control and movement required in futsal , which he played as a youngster , for his progress			0
@entity39 is an important cog in the @entity40 team and has 68 appearances for them , as well as a cap for @entity41			0
@entity39 celebrates a goal for @entity40 in their @entity60 match with @entity61 this season 8			0
@entity62 ( @entity63 and @entity11 ) only 21 , @entity62 has established himself as a mainstay in the @entity63 team and as a regular for @entity11 too - and do n't expect him to budge anytime soon			2
the midfielder possesses that rare blend of strength , pace and technique that allows him to take games by the scruff of the neck and he 's demonstrated that quality time after time			0
he is closing in on 100 competitive @entity63 appearances and has won 10 caps for his country though there are suggestions a big - money move could be afoot			0
@entity62 embarks on another bustling run for @entity63 against @entity84 on @entity85 7			0
@entity86 ( @entity87 and @entity88 ) tipped to become the next great @entity90 midfielder , @entity86 came through the ranks at @entity87 having joined the club from neighbours real aged 14			1
but it was a loan spell at @entity95 last season that was the making of him and their better - than - expected 12th - place finish in @entity101 was in no small part due to his influence			2
capped by @entity88 to under 21 level , @entity86 is an uncompromising tackler with quick wits and a very good reading of the game			2
@entity86 celebrates scoring for @entity87 in a @entity101 game with @entity110 6			0
@entity111 ( @entity112 and @entity113 ) a man very much on the radar of the leading @entity118 clubs , the versatile @entity114 international @entity111 , 20 , has already seen and done a great deal			1
he played 73 times for his first club , @entity121 , before arriving at @entity122 in 2012 and has since clocked up 73 more games as an important member of the team			0
his career has seen him flit between defensive and advanced midfield positions but with his accomplished dribbling and passing , he is adept at both roles			0
@entity111 ( left ) takes on @entity133 's @entity132 during a recent friendly match in @entity135 5			1
@entity136 ( @entity137 and @entity138 ) at the age of just 20 , @entity136 is regarded as the best free - kick taker in @entity141 and he has certainly been illuminating the @entity142 with his set - piece prowess			1
he left struggling @entity144 for @entity137 in the summer in a deal worth £ 12m and has already found the net seven times in both domestic and @entity15 competition			1
@entity136 is so highly rated , @entity41 wanted him to represent them but he chose the country of his parents , @entity138 , and has so far collected five caps			0
free - kick master @entity136 playing for @entity137 this season 4			1
@entity152 ( @entity153 , on loan from @entity155 , and @entity88 ) a young man who needs no introduction to @entity118 fans following his highly impressive loan spell with @entity63 last season			1
@entity152 , 20 , was shipped out again by @entity155 at the start of the summer - this time to @entity153 - but many were quick to question why @entity163 had not kept him			1
his speed and direct style of attack mark @entity152 , who can play on the wing or further forward , as an exciting player to watch			0
@entity152 was a hit at @entity63 when on loan from @entity155 last season 3			1
@entity172 ( @entity133 and @entity173 ) one of the hottest properties on the continent , @entity172 is wanted by a host of top @entity118 clubs after struggling to hold down a place in the @entity133 side			1
it 's a frustrating situation for the highly - regarded 19 - year - old midfielder , whose command on the pitch , skill and incisive passing are more mature than his years			0
capped by @entity173 up to under 21 standard , @entity172 is likely to make the step up if he can gain regular football , potentially in @entity11			0
@entity133 's @entity172 ( right ) playing against @entity112 in a friendly match in @entity190 last month 2			1
@entity6 ( @entity4 and @entity11 ) blessed with a magnetic touch and lightning pace , @entity6 was a dynamic part of @entity4 's brush with @entity118 title glory last season and is arguably @entity199 football 's greatest hope for the future			1
still just 20 , @entity6 seems to have accomplished an awful lot already , with over 100 appearances and 18 goals for @entity4 , and 13 caps for his country			1
and his achievements are being noticed - @entity6 won the @entity207 for the best young player in @entity141 last month			2
@entity6 won the @entity210 award recently for being @entity141 's best young player 1			2
@entity212 ( @entity155 and @entity88 ) it 's clear that @entity155 feel the time has come for @entity212 , their 19 - year - old wonderkid , and they have used him in several matches this season			1
as he had demonstrated time after time in @entity155 's youth ranks , the @entity218 prodigy boasts fleet of foot , speed of thought , bags of confidence and a willingness to shoot at goal			2
that is now being unleashed on defences in @entity101 and the @entity60 , with many glittering years likely to be ahead of him			0
@entity155 's bright talent @entity212 in action against @entity232 on sunday night			1

new £ 25m deal will ensure @entity6 's place in @entity4 team
other bright @entity15 hopes *include* @entity212 at @entity155
@entity133 's @entity172 is linked with a number of @entity118 clubs
@entity152 and @entity86 are other bright @entity90 hopes
@entity136 of @entity137 arguably takes best free - kicks
