by @entity0 published : 19:52 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 04:28 est , 8 april 2013 a @entity2 mp has offended @entity4 ’s @entity3 by describing their traditional welcome dance as ‘ uncivilised and grotesque ’			1
right - wing politician @entity6 went on to say in a piece she wrote for a @entity2 newspaper that she was shocked to be welcomed by a dancing ‘ half naked man ’			1
the traditional greeting , known as a powhiri , is given as an honour to visitors to @entity4 , but miss @entity6 has left the @entity3 in no doubt that she failed to understand the value they all place upon the ceremony			1
offended : @entity2 mp @entity6 has angered @entity4 's @entity3 by describing their traditional welcome dance as ' grotesque ' ( file picture ) miss @entity6 recalled that when she arrived at the @entity22 , the headquarters of the @entity23 located on the @entity24 , she and the group she was with were greeted by a man shouting and screaming in @entity3 and poking his tongue out			1
she felt like an idiot , she said , as she gave a hongi - rubbing her nose with a warrior - and the waiata , a @entity3 song , performed by naval personnel sounded like a @entity2 children ’s song about a happy ladybird			2
the song , she said , was accompanied by a ‘ kindergarten - teacher - guitar - accompaniment			0
’ she dubbed the powhiri as an ‘ uncivilised ’ ritual and a marae , a communal or sacred gathering house , a ‘ grotesque ’ mark of multicultural worship			0
miss @entity6 was part of a defence delegation visiting @entity4 last month			1
‘ when we came to a naval base , we were not received with a handshake or salute by uniformed men as usual , ’ she wrote			0
‘ no we were welcomed with a @entity3 dance ritual , with a half - naked man in a grass skirt , shouting and screaming in @entity3			1
’ tradition : the @entity4 rugby team perform a traditional @entity3 dance prior to matches the man , she said , performed ‘ strange rituals and poked his tongue out			1
’ referring to the marae , she said the temple was ‘ decorated with god - figures with angry faces and large erect penisis			0
' it ’s a mystery to me how the poor naval officers could endure both the ceremony and the surroundings			0
’ @entity3 said today that the politician clearly had no understanding about the local culture and should have , at least , had the decency to read about it before arriving in the country			2
@entity3 culture expert dr @entity77 , said her remarks showed complete ignorance			2
‘ she has a totally monocultural view of the world and does n’t understand that the welcome she received is the highest honour , ’ said dr @entity80			0
‘ @entity3 customs had obviously not been explained to her before her visit			2
‘ her remarks are very short sighted			0
‘ very often politicians are not as well educated as they make out to be , ’ he added .			0
