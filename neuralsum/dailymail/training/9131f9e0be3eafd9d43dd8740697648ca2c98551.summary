by @entity0 last updated at 12:41 pm on 24th november 2011 a 67 - foot pregnant fin whale was being examined by biologists yesterday after its carcass was washed up in @entity4			1
over 100 people descended to @entity6 , in the city ’s @entity7 , to watch the examination , which determined the whale had been killed by a ship which fractured its vertebral column , according local newspaper reports			2
and sir @entity16 's @entity15 organisation is paying for the carcass to be towed out to sea and sunk deep into the ocean tomorrow so researchers can study its decomposition over the next several years			1
examination : over 100 people descended to @entity6 , in @entity4 's @entity7 , to watch the examination of the dead fin whale the cost of towing the whale is very expensive , but @entity15 's operations manager @entity27 said the effort made by @entity15 is part of a larger vision by @entity16 to ‘ get the world excited about exploring ’ the deep ocean			1
@entity27 told the @entity33 : ‘ the first thing that is going to happen after we sink the whale is it ’s probably going to get attacked by all the deep sea critters that hang out around at 2,500 feet down			0
‘ that ’s going to include hack fish , shrimp [ and ] crab and they are probably going to be working away on it for the next several years			0
’ @entity4 lifeguards are patrolling the carcass until tomorrow and the towing will take place under the supervision of the @entity49 pregnant whale : the fin whale was pregnant when it died , leading its foetus ( bottom right ) be be expelled from its body 48 hours after its death helped by lifeguards : local lifeguards originally towed the body from the @entity60 to @entity6 so the carcass could be examined funding : sir @entity16 's @entity15 is paying for the boat and fuel to tow the whale along with the mother whale , which could weigh up to 70 tons , its five - foot foetus had apparently been expelled from its body around 48 hours after it died , due to bloating , scientists said			1
the whale originally washed up near @entity70 on saturday afternoon before @entity4 lifeguards moved the carcass over six miles to @entity6 where it could be examined			0
lifeguard @entity73 told the newspaper : ‘ everything went according to plan but i can honestly tell you the lifeguards were struggling with the enormity of the whale			0
’ sir @entity16 ’s undersea leisure venture company is paying for the boat and fuel in return for the research			2
the carcass will be sunk near the @entity86 and @entity87 , where scientists will study the decomposing body over the years to come and see how new ecosystems form			2
fin whales are the second largest living mammals after the blue whale and grow up to 88 feet in length .			0

@entity96 's @entity15 is paying for the boat and fuel to tow the whale so researchers can study its decomposition over several years
