by @entity0 published : 18:48 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 8 june 2013 trouble : metropolitan police commissioner @entity1 is facing accusations that he leaked details of the ' @entity5 ' affair to the press @entity8 's top police officer was facing further questions last night over allegations that he leaked details of the police inquiry into the ‘ @entity5 ’ affair			1
in a letter to a senior @entity16 official , metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity1 has admitted briefing journalists about the row involving @entity20 mp @entity19 days before media reports claimed there was no evidence that officers lied about being insulted by the former cabinet minister			1
the letter emerged after friends of the mp used a @entity29 request to @entity30 to obtain details of the meetings with journalists			2
in it , sir @entity1 also admits he failed to keep any record of what was said during the meetings			1
last night , friends of mr @entity19 said the commissioner still had questions to answer over the handling of the investigation and what was said to journalists			2
one mp said : ‘ it is of concern that no police note was made of exactly what was said so that we have to rely on @entity1 ’s own personal recollection			1
’ in the letter to @entity55 , the @entity16 ’s most senior policing official , the commissioner says he was present at two meetings involving five newspapers and the @entity58 on march 25 and 26 this year			0
he writes that he told journalists he was ‘ concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of @entity64 on 19 september this could result in reputational damage for all concerned ’			0
mr @entity19 was forced to resign as chief whip following an altercation in @entity64 in which he was alleged to have called officers ‘ * * * * * * * plebs ’ – something he strongly denies			1
the force began an investigation , called @entity73 , into the @entity5 officers and the leaking of police logs backing up their account of the incident to newspapers			2
row : @entity19 was alleged to have called officer ' * * * * * * * plebs ' the saga took a further twist at the end of march – only days after sir @entity1 ’s two meetings with journalists – when it was claimed police had briefed newspapers on the investigation before a report on the inquiry was handed to prosecutors , and that it exonerated the officers			1
but in the letter , the commissioner says that he had not seen the police file			0
he tells mr @entity55 : ‘ as commissioner , it is not normal practice for me to see our investigative files and i can say categorically that i have not seen the file relating to @entity73			0
‘ therefore , i was not in a position to brief on the contents			0
‘ i am briefed on the broad progress of an investigation , particularly the timetable and any significant resource implications			0
’ he adds that in the course of answering journalists ’ questions : ‘ i did say that i was concerned that if we did not conclusively prove what happened at the gate of @entity64 on 19 september this could result in reputational damage for all concerned			0
we could therefore be left in the position of having one person ’s word against another			0
’ but the commissioner conceded that neither he nor the press officer accompanying him to the meetings took any notes – something he said was ‘ usual practice ’ when meeting with editors for ‘ non-reportable briefings ’			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity131 said that no decision has been taken on whether any of the officers will face charges over @entity5			1
@entity64 spat : mr @entity19 is alleged to have launched into an extraordinary four - letter rant when security officers asked him to take his bicycle out through a side entrance calling them ' f * * * * * * plebs ' hitting back : the revelation came as mr @entity19 's lawyer confirmed he has launched a libel lawsuit against @entity144 which first broke the story to face ' the campaign of vilification by the newspaper against him '			1

sir @entity1 has admitted to briefing journalist about the @entity19 row
he admits to ' not taking any notes ' of meetings with editors
decision over whether the officers will face charges over @entity5 yet to be made
@entity19 *vigorously* denies calling officers ' f * * * * * * plebs '
