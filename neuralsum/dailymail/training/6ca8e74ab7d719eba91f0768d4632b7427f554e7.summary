@entity0 has helped countless celebrities including @entity2 get their enviable physiques			1
now the trainer , 39 , has revealed her secrets on how to combat ageing and banish bingo wings on the actress 's lifestyle website @entity8			1
but her tips may leave the reader more confused than inspired as she writes about having ' conversations with our bodies ' and ensuring our muscles do n't have ' atrophy - induced holes '			1
fit friends : @entity0 , right , has helped @entity2 maintain her perfect figure exercise expert : @entity0 shows off her flat stomach at the @entity23 in 2014 but finding out how she did it from her recent @entity8 post is n't crystal clear using some unusual rhetoric , @entity0 states : ' if you spend your life nurturing your innate ability to move your body in a way that continuously sparks a new conversation - within the same philosophy - you will keep your muscles vital and engaged			1
' by doing that , you will have a live working wire that does n't have atrophy - induced holes that create cellulite and sagging skin tone as you age			1
' it must all make sense to @entity2 , 42 , who has long extolled @entity0 's virtues as a personal trainer			1
she 's no stranger to nonsensical jargon , famously referring to her split from @entity47 , the father of her two children , as ' conscious uncoupling '			0
the actress , pictured making a tv appearance with @entity0 in 2013 , is no stranger to confusing jargon put simply , mother - of - two @entity0 is saying the secret to having firmer , younger looking skin is to exercise more , doing strength and conditioning moves that give you an all body workout - and that do n't just focus on one group of muscles			2
she said : ' if you have a tight , strong , and healthy muscle design , and you are good at cardio , sweating , and detoxifying , then your skin will age much better			0
' she adds that there 's ' no pill , cleanse , or quick fix ' that is going to ' outperform exercise ' when it comes to rolling back the years			2
so if you want a healthy body and want to stay looking young , you 're going to have to work for it			0
by using her method of workouts targeting specific muscle groups , she claims you wo n't have to worry about ' chicken wings ' ( aka bingo wings , the dreaded under arm flab )			0
she blames poor ' muscular design ' for the phenomenon and suggests developing a ' tight and strong ' upper arm through plenty of exercise			0
she said this will help the skin age better and reduce the loss of collagen and proteins that cause it to sag			0
these are the principles she shares in her famous ' 30 @entity92 ' which has helped stars like @entity2 , @entity94 and @entity95 stay in shape			2
@entity0 urges women not to wait until their forties or fifties to take action on having a healthy body as the muscles will begin to age in the thirties			2
or as she puts it : ' we all need to wear gym t - shirts that say " later - life knowledge seeker " for our muscles , because for them to stay " young , " just like the rest of our system , they need to be fed and challenged regularly			0
