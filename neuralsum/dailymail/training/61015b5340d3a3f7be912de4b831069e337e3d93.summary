by @entity0 published : 11:06 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 14 october 2013 council workers will be paid thousands of pounds to park their cars - even if they do not drive to work , it was revealed today			0
staff will receive up to £ 800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking - but the handout will be given even if workers walk , cycle or use public transport			1
@entity12 in @entity13 will pay the sums to around 400 employees , because there are only six spaces at its new town centre headquarters			1
changing locations : the car park at the @entity12 offices in @entity13			1
staff will receive up to £ 800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking but angry tax campaigners have branded the payouts ' ridiculous '			1
it comes as the authority relocates from a site with free parking to a new £ 12million home less than two miles away			2
the lowest paid staff will get £ 800 for the next three years , falling gradually to £ 267 by 2021/22 - a total of £ 4,801			2
top earners will receive £ 533 for the first year , dropping to nothing by 2017/18			2
@entity35 , of the @entity36 , said : ‘ moving the council offices might be a slight inconvenience for staff			2
but it is ridiculous that this allowance is going to those that catch the bus or bike to work			0
‘ most local residents who commute pay for their own travel , so they will find it hard to swallow that their council tax is being used in this way			2
‘ at a time when budgets are tight , the council should focus on saving taxpayers ' cash and delivering frontline services , not paying for staff perks			2
’ statement : the authority says its current home is in need of repair and moving to the ' more accessible ' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices even the council 's new chief executive will have to pay for parking at the new site , which only has three spaces for pool cars and three disabled bays			1
moving : the new offices for @entity12 in @entity13 are still being built an annual parking permit in the town costs £ 1,067			1
today , residents reacted in anger to the announcement			0
health carer @entity79 , 30 , from @entity12 , said other workers would find the payouts unfair			1
she added : ‘ any other person who works in other town centre offices has to pay to park			1
people who already work there will feel it 's unfair they have to pay but council workers do n't			1
why should we pay for their parking when we have to pay ourselves ? ’ the council defended the ' self - funding ' scheme , saying its current home is in need of repair and moving to the ' more accessible ' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices			0
a council spokesman said : ‘ this time - limited scheme recognises the transitional costs for staff in this move			0
the scheme will be self - funding and will not be a cost to borough residents over the life of the scheme			0
’ councillors will be able to claim back parking fees on expenses			0
council leader @entity114 said for some workers it would be more convenient if they lived in @entity12 or because the building was close to rail and bus links			1
but union chiefs said the payments showed ' contempt ' for staff			0
@entity124 , regional organiser for union @entity126 , argued staff would still face paying out more money , due to the parking permit cost			0
he said : ‘ it is saying to continue working for us you can pay £ 200 for the privilege - that 's disgraceful			1
‘ these are staff having to do more , work harder because the demand is much greater on services and there 's fewer staff doing it			1
it shows a contempt for the employees			0
’ the council spokesman said they could not put an overall figure on the payments , following the relocation next spring			0
he added : ' the scheme would be self - funding and would likely not include staff who join after april			0
the report has been taken to cabinet but is still out for consultation			0

staff will still receive handout if walking , cycling or using public transport
