by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 19 september 2012 updated : 04:54 est , 20 september 2012 @entity1 , editor - in - chief of @entity4 's @entity3 magazine said he intends to publish 70 topless photos of the @entity6 police yesterday raided the offices of @entity10 magazine closer in the hunt for the photographer who took topless pictures of the @entity6			1
detectives confirmed they were looking for evidence at @entity9 ’s @entity17 headquarters ‘ which might lead to the identity ’ of the paparazzi photographer responsible			1
but as they searched for evidence a @entity21 magazine was publishing the intimate photographs			0
and a @entity4 celebrity weekly publication called @entity25 ( see and hear ) announced that it was planning to reproduce over 60 photos today spread across a 16 - page supplement			1
@entity1 , @entity25 ’s editor in chief , declined to say who sold the photographs or how much was paid for them			0
but the news underlined fears that the landmark injunction won by the @entity35 and @entity6 48 hours ago will do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures			0
@entity38 said it was aware of the @entity4 magazine ’s plans , but reissued a statement made at the weekend , saying : ‘ as we ’ve said , we will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review			1
’ @entity49 and @entity6 have won a court order banning @entity10 closer – which first published the topless photos in what @entity10 judges said was a ‘ brutal ’ invasion of privacy – from selling or republishing the photographs , under the threat of a 100,000 euro fine			1
stop - off : the @entity35 and @entity6 made a brief stop at @entity61 in @entity62 today on their way back to @entity64 smiling : the royal couple wave to cheering and probably surprised people as they walk through the airport however , it is the unknown photographer – not the magazine – who is thought to own the copyright to the photographs , and there is as yet nothing to prevent them from continuing to cash in on the controversial images			1
with @entity10 authorities so far unable to discover the name of the person who took the photographs at a chateau in the south of @entity10 , there is no injunction banning him or her selling the pictures in @entity10 or around the world			2
@entity89 , a barrister who specialises in media law , questioned the legality of the @entity17 raid – suggesting it had been authorised solely because members of the @entity94 were involved			2
journalistic sources , including photographers , are strictly protected by @entity10 law			2
‘ a law of january 2 , 2010 , protects the confidentiality of sources , as do numerous decisions of the @entity101 , ’ said mr @entity89			0
‘ in the case of @entity49 and @entity6 , i do not see how a prosecutor could justify a search of @entity9			0
’ storm : police closed the building of @entity10 closer magazine after the pictures appeared in an issue last week			1
right : @entity111 @entity4 's @entity3 , magazine has said he intends to print 70 pictures a police source close to the case said the raid – carried out by officers from the @entity120 working under the instructions of prosecutors – had been authorised by a ‘ judicial request ’ for information , specifically the name of the photographer involved			1
the pictures are already widely available on the internet and have been printed in @entity131 ’s @entity130 newspaper and @entity133 ’s @entity132			0
earlier this week it was revealed that photographer @entity135 filmed the @entity6 sunbathing at the @entity10 chateau and any financial penalty @entity9 might incur will be heavily outweighed by a massive rise in revenue and circulation : the @entity6 topless pictures issue sold 500,000 copies , about 100,000 more than usual			1
mr @entity1 says his @entity4 magazine was offered 240 photographs but is using only 60 or 70			1
they will be available only in the print version of the magazine , not published on its website			0
he reportedly told one @entity152 newspaper that the @entity10 injunction did not affect his magazine as he had been in possession of the photographs for several days before the @entity17 court ruling			1
he said : ‘ it ’s a set of unique photos from an @entity161 celebrity			0
we are a leading gossip magazine in @entity4 , and it is my job to publish them			2
‘ if the @entity167 royal family want to sue us , then it will happen and we ’ll deal with it			2
‘ our readers love to follow the lives of celebrities and royals and are always looking for news that brings them up close			0
it is in @entity25 ’s dna to entertain and satisfy our readers ’ curiosity			0
‘ therefore it is always relevant for us when a duchess and the future queen of @entity64 is topless and willingly reveals her breasts towards a public road			1
’ the magazine ’s sister publication in @entity21 , @entity21 & @entity186 , published 11 of the @entity6 photos yesterday			0
‘ it is nothing new to us to publish nude photos of celebrities on holiday , ’ said its chief editor @entity188 , who added that the pictures were bought last friday ‘ from photographers and photo agencies , the way we always do ’ and ‘ before everything erupted ’			2
@entity202 marks the spot : the long lens pictures taken of the topless @entity35 were shot from the side of the road between trees around half a mile away from the chateau			0

@entity4 publication will print 60 - 70 photos in a supplement
editor : ' it is always relevant for us when a duchess and the future queen of @entity64 is topless '
officers closed @entity10 closer 's @entity17 offices at 10am
identity of photographer has still not been revealed
judges in @entity10 have banned any republishing of the pictures
royal couple are now *returning* to @entity167 after their tour of the @entity233
