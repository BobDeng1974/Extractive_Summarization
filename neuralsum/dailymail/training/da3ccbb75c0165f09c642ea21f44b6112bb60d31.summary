a mother - of - two who fell desperately ill on @entity1 had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after being hit by pneumonia			1
@entity5 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , is a keen runner who was training for a half marathon when she reported feeling short of breath of december 24			1
she was found to be suffering from pneumonia and her condition rapidly deteriorated over the following days			1
after being put into a medically - induced coma on christmas day , she has since battled multiple organ failure , meningitis , septicaemia , blood clots and bleeding on the brain			1
she came out of her coma on @entity32 , but is still in intensive care in @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity5 's sister - in - law , @entity36 , said : ' @entity5 does n't have any underlying medical conditions so this came completely out of the blue			0
' she was suffering from flu - like symptoms just before @entity1 but we thought nothing of it as it is so common at that time of year			1
' the first we knew anything was seriously wrong was when she could n't breathe and she had to be rushed to @entity45 in an ambulance on @entity1			1
she 's now at @entity47 's , since they transferred her there in the early hours of @entity50			0
' we have been living through it , it has almost been an out of body experience , there has been no good news at all			0
' we were close to losing her before she got transferred to @entity35 , the doctors said she might not make it at one point			2
' the mother - of - two 's family , including husband @entity61 and sons @entity63 and @entity64 , did n't realise just how ill she was before she was suddenly rushed to hospital on @entity1 @entity5 's husband @entity61 , 37 , has been at her side throughout the ordeal , but he has kept their children , four - year - old @entity63 and 19 - month - old @entity64 , away until their mum is up to seeing them			2
she came out of her coma on @entity32 and doctors at @entity34 are hopeful @entity5 will be well enough to be transferred to @entity45 next week , but she is still battling a potentially fatal blood clot			2
pneumonia is a swelling of the lung tissue , usually caused by an infection			2
early symptoms include a phlegmy cough , fever or difficulty breathing			0
mild cases can be treated with antibiotics but more serious cases , which can be exacerbated by underlying health problems , can lead to more serious complications			2
if left untreated , oxygen levels in the heart and brain can fall , leading to confusion , coma and organ failure , which can be fatal			1
pneumonia can also lead to septicaemia , which can in turn mean amputations are needed			2
her devastated family have now set up a fundraising page to pay for her rehabilitation and the prosthetic legs and feet they fear she will eventually need			1
they have so far raised nearly £ 25,000			0
her sister - in - law added : ' it 's really humbling , we were up to nearly £ 18,000 in less than 24 hours			0
' it just proves that @entity5 is such a beautiful , lovely and caring person that so many people want to help her out			0
' we have had people who did n't even know @entity5 contributing and those saying they ca n't afford much but giving what they can			0
' we know that when she comes out of hospital she is going to need a lot of help			0
' every penny will help @entity5 and we are so grateful to everyone who has donated , we are raising the money for her rehab and ultimately the best prosthetic feet we can buy			0
' @entity5 , who works for @entity125 at @entity126 in @entity45 , had been training to run the @entity128 later this year and had been training with the @entity129 before becoming ill. a fellow member has now taken her spot and will donate everything she raises to @entity5 's cause			0
to donate to visit @entity134 her family have now set up a fundraising campaign to pay for her rehabilitation when she is out of hospital			1
