if you devour your @entity2 dinner but ca n't bring yourself to sample the cook 's @entity4 's sprouts , you may now have an excuse : it 's in your genes			2
a chemistry teacher has created an infographic explaining the chemistry and genetics behind why some people ca n’t stand the taste of bitter vegetables			2
those who loathe the seasonal greens , @entity17 explains , may be especially sensitive to naturally occurring chemical compounds called glucosinolates			1
hate sprouts ? you 've got a new excuse : a chemistry teacher argues that there may be a chemical and genetic reason why some people ca n’t stand the taste of @entity4 sprouts			1
people who loathe the seasonal green vegetables may be especially sensitive to chemical compounds called glucosinolates , which occur naturally in sprouts the @entity35 - based teacher , who runs the blog @entity36 , explained that these compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked			1
these compounds , while bitter to everyone , taste especially unpalatable to almost three quarters of humans			2
a similar phenomenon is observed in a synthetic compound called @entity46 ( @entity46 ) , not found in sprouts , that tastes bitter to 70 per cent of people , while remaining tasteless to the remaining 30 per cent			1
it was discovered when a chemist called @entity52 , who was working at @entity53 in 1931 , accidentally spilt some of the chemical			0
while it did not affect him , his colleague complained of a bitter taste , leading the scientists to not only discover that it only tastes bitter to some people , but that those that the ability to taste it is genetic			2
@entity35 - based teacher @entity17 , explained that the compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked , which have similar properties to man - made compounds that taste bitter to almost three quarters of people , causing them to find the small festive vegetables unpleasant ( pictured ) @entity4 sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane , a product of the glucosinolates			1
while research is ongoing , studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer			0
this compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties			0
similarly , another compound called propylthiouracil ( @entity88 ) only tastes bitter to certain people			0
mr @entity17 explained that while neither compound can be found in sprouts , they both contain a thiocyanate group in their molecular structures , which is thought to be related to their bitter taste			0
and the same group is found in glucosinolate compounds , which occur naturally in @entity4 sprouts			1
they are also found in broccoli , cabbage and kale , known as cruciferous vegetables			0
it ’s thought they protect the plants against diseases and ward off insects that nibble on them			0
mr @entity17 writes : ‘ there seems to be a strong association between the ability to detect the bitter taste of @entity46 and @entity88 and a sensitivity to the bitterness of these vegetables , ’ suggesting that the reason why some people find sprouts so unpleasant , may be genetic			1
‘ it ’s not the case that sensitivity to @entity46 and @entity88 automatically implies a dislike of cruciferous vegetables			0
‘ but if you ’re a @entity4 sprouts hater , you can now suggest a potential chemical reason for your dislike if you ’re ever berated for your perceived vegetable prejudice			1
’ @entity4 sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane , which is a product of the glucosinolates			1
while research is ongoing , it suggests that sulforaphanes may protect against neurodegenerative diseases and even cancer			0
this compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigate for its antioxidant properties .			0

people who loathe @entity4 sprouts may be especially sensitive to chemical compounds called glucosinolates
glucosinolates are turned into isothiocyanate compounds when sprouts are cooked
isothiocyanates have similar properties to man - made compounds that taste bitter to almost three quarters of people
the ability to taste this bitterness is thought to be genetic , explaining why some people like sprouts more
