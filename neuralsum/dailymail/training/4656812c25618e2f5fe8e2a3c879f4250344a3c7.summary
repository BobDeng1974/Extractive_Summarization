@entity0 believes @entity1 may never again sign a first - team player from the @entity4 top flight due to the unprecedented sums of money flooding into the @entity7			1
the game @entity9 was further enriched this week with news of a three - year deal worth over £ 5bn being brokered with @entity12 and @entity13 from 2016 - 17			1
with the @entity19 game earning around £ 15m per season from broadcasters , the huge disparity in resources between clubs like @entity17 and @entity1 is widening			1
@entity0 has revealed he struggles to compete against @entity7 clubs for signings @entity0 insisted that he found some @entity4 games ‘ boring ’ in comparison to what ’s going on in @entity19 but he realises that the days when his club plundered the likes of @entity28 for @entity29 are unlikely to be witnessed again			1
‘ there are two ways to get players			2
one , they are @entity19 and they want to come back and play for @entity1 or other teams in @entity19			1
or two , they are young and need to play , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ but if they are an established player at @entity28 there are grades where they will go , and we are not even the next one down			2
they will go to somewhere like @entity43 , maybe then @entity44 and then even the @entity45 , because the money there is much better than at @entity1			1
’ asked if there was any point in now deploying scouts to watch first - team games at the top end of the @entity4 game , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes , for the youngsters			1
but @entity55 , @entity56 … i do n’t think they will come			2
‘ there has to be a special reason — maybe players between the ages of 15 and 25 and again they have to have some relation to @entity1			1
‘ maybe they are @entity63 , someone who loves @entity1 and has a dream to play for @entity1			1
we need to bring up our own and then they go out , and we bring them back again			0
that is possible i think			0
’ @entity0 , pictured with @entity1 captain @entity68 , insists @entity45 sides can even beat his side to signings intimidating though the latest tv deal down south is , @entity0 maintains it only has limited relevance for @entity19 football			1
@entity4 may virtually be a no - go area now as far as signing ready - made talents is concerned but the @entity77 sees no barriers to @entity19 clubs rearing their own			1
@entity80 , who played for @entity0 at @entity81 aged 15 , has just joined @entity82 and the @entity1 manager feels there could be other such talents within @entity19			1
‘ @entity80 is a once in every 10 years players in @entity89			0
i have seen very good players but he is very special at that level , ’ he added			0
‘ but @entity92 can come from @entity19 if you believe in it			1
you have to develop him like @entity92 and that is not about results			0
it is about making him into a complete football player			0
‘ if i tell my players they have to give the ball back to the midfield because they ca n’t take the ball with their back to the goal then they will never play for a @entity107 or whatever			0
@entity82 were able to entice @entity77 international @entity80 to the @entity108 in january ‘ you should never give young players boundaries			0
i have told my first - team players if they make a mistake with a pass i could n’t care less			0
‘ as long as you work hard , mistakes will happen			0
if they make a mistake i will never have a go at them because they have to have freedom on the pitch so they learn			0
’ despite being financially hamstrung , @entity0 feels there is much to commend the @entity19 game for compared with much of what he ’s witnessed in @entity4			1
‘ @entity19 football has so much enthusiasm , ’ he added			2
‘ i do n’t think too much about money			0
it is important for fans to understand the @entity4 clubs are getting more money and we have no chance to compete with budgets			1
but we can be better at other things that does n’t cost money like developing players and people			0
‘ i think we should be more proud of it ( the game in @entity19 )			2
the interest here is phenomenal			0
‘ when you go to @entity1 games away , the fans are fantastic			2
‘ i have been many times to @entity4 and i am bored compared with what ’s happening here in the stands sometimes			2
‘ the game against @entity153 is special			0
they do n’t have that			0
‘ i have been at @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity107 , @entity158 and it ’s not near the atmosphere there was in that game			0
’ @entity0 has said the atmosphere at the likes of @entity156 and @entity157 does not rival the @entity165			2

@entity1 boss @entity0 has admitted he struggles in the *transfer* *market*
@entity0 believes disparity between @entity19 and @entity4 sides is widening
