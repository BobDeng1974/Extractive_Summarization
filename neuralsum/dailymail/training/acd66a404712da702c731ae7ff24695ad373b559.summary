the @entity1 government may deny their existence , but photos taken from space have revealed in unprecedented detail the concentration camps that are used imprison more than 200,000 citizens			1
men , women and children are forced to work seven days a week as slaves and eat ' rats , frogs , snakes , insects ' and even faeces to battle starvation in the camps			1
previously there have been blurred images taken by satellite but new detailed pictures from @entity24 's @entity23 allow a closer look at the sites - and also prove they have grown			1
experts say the tens of thousands of prisoners at the camps are often taken from their homes or in the street for supposed ' political crimes ' rather than actual misdemeanours			1
closed off : close to its border with @entity39 , the camp in @entity36 in @entity37 , has never been seen in so much detail secluded : surrounded by snow this camp in @entity43 , @entity44 , is where many prisoners will die in complete squalor after working as slaves half of all the inmates will die of starvation or malnutrition with others dying because of fatal diseases that thrive in the squalid conditions			2
this is if they are not killed by torture , firing squad , or a public stoning by @entity62 's violent guards , former prisoners say			1
one of the photos shows the @entity65 camp , which holds an estimated 50,000 @entity1 prisoners and is hidden in the mountains around 70 miles from the capital @entity69			1
@entity70 was only nine years old when he and his family were sent there for political crimes			1
' we had no food			0
we eat anything we could get our hands on -- rats , snakes , frogs , insects , ' he told @entity83 news			0
' we just had to find a way to survive			0
' ' even though it happened a long time ago when i look at the satellite pictures i can still remember everything i saw and endured , ' he said			0
' the camp definitely looks bigger			0
for example , new buildings for prison guards were n't there before			0
i can only assume that means there are more prisoners being held and therefore more security is needed			2
' @entity70 spent 10 years in @entity65 before escaping to @entity39 in 1992 and wrote about his experiences in the book @entity100			0
secret : photos of the camp , only know as 22 , were taken after finding their locations on @entity105 undeniable proof of existence : these satellite photos are of the @entity1 prison camp @entity110			2
the images show the camp in detail ( top left ) and then slowly zoom away to show its location in the country ( bottom right ) it is believed he is the first prisoner to reveal to the world the existence of @entity65			0
' the thing i remember the most about in the camp is how the prison guards would kill people for no reason			2
i witnessed many people being executed , ' he said			2
@entity130 has compared the satellite images to those taken 10 years ago and confirms they are growing in size and branded them ' hellish '			0
' the outside world certainly does n't know what 's going on and very little from the inside comes out , ' @entity135 , from @entity130 said last month			0
deadly : @entity62 's @entity1 deny the existence of any camps , but this image of camp no. 14 in @entity143 , @entity44 , shows clearly buildings and a large open yard ' the very little that has come out paints a very disturbing picture			1
' @entity148 , director of the science and human rights program at @entity130 added : ' the fact that we would have to rely on satellite imagery just to dispel the government 's assertion that these camps do n't exist is testament really to the scale of the human travesty that might be going on inside			2
' the news came as it was revealed the @entity24 government will send a group of religious leaders and representatives to visit @entity1 tomorrow on a peace mission			1
the @entity23 says delegates from the @entity166 will leave for @entity69 on wednesday , where they will discuss peace and human rights issues			0
it is also understood they could meet with @entity1 leader @entity62 .			1
