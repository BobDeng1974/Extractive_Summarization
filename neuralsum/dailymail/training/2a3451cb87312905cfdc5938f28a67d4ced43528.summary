the surroundings may be different , but the goal is the same for @entity2			1
the @entity4 defensive tackle wants the team to continue their strong start to the season and move to 6 - 2 with victory over the @entity9 at @entity10 on saturday			1
@entity4 landed in @entity11 on the back of a 24 - 23 win over the @entity14 and atop a competitive @entity15 ahead of the @entity16			1
' it has been a tough first half of the season so far , ' @entity2 told @entity19			1
' our goal at this moment is to go to 6 - 2 , go into our bye week , rest up and come back out stronger			1
' the @entity4 have made a seamless transition from former head coach @entity25 to @entity26 and find themselves well placed for a run at the post-season			1
@entity2 ( left ) wants the @entity4 to continue their strong start to the season this weekend suh at an event at @entity32 in @entity33 but last season , @entity4 were similarly well placed			1
they entered their bye week at 5 - 3 and followed up with a narrow win at the @entity36 to strengthen their hold on the division			1
a 40 - 10 @entity40 day thrashing of @entity16 had the @entity4 in control of the @entity15 , but that was their only win in their last seven games			1
@entity4 finished 7 - 9 with four straight defeats and third behind the @entity16 and @entity36			1
' the switch from coach @entity25 to coach @entity26 has been good , ' @entity2 said			2
' coach @entity26 is very transparent and understands what he needs from you as a player and a very open communicator			2
' he is a guy i have grown to like as i have got to know him more and more and is good for @entity4			2
' it was tough last year to see that all unfold the way it did			2
there were a lot of things we know we could have done better			0
unfortunately that 's the way the ball fell and we were outside the playoffs and could n't find a way to get in			0
' it is something that i have personally forgotten and moved past			2
this is a new season and we are off to a fairly decent start and hope to finish the first half on a really good note			0
' it 's always best to learn from your own mistakes and not let them repeat themselves			0
a lot of guys who were there last year and took part in that will understand that if it starts to creep up again we will find a way to combat it			0
' @entity2 pictured arriving at @entity83 as the @entity4 touched down in @entity84 on tuesday morning @entity2 ( centre ) joined @entity9 's @entity86 ( left ) and @entity87 ( right ) on stage for the @entity32 event @entity2 is into his fifth season in the @entity91 and part of a fearsome @entity4 defense - the best in the league after seven weeks			1
the defensive tackle seems to have moved on from his disciplinary problems ( he was fined three times in three months last season ) with attention now on his performances			1
' i do n't think the fines and the negative connotations have held me back from developing , ' he said			0
' i think just from an imagery standpoint , people understanding who i am is overshadowed			0
' but that 's just the way the world works â€“ negativity sells			0
i do n't really worry about it			0
i understand who i am as a person and have a strong group behind me			0
day in and day out they take care of me			0
i have been fortunate this year , playing at a high level and just flying under the radar			0
@entity4 wide receiver @entity120 arrives in @entity84 , but is still an injury doubt for the game ' over the last four or five years i have developed the skills to put me up there among the best defensive tackles in the league right now			2
i think there 's a lot of room for improvement each and every year			0
' as a young pro becoming a veteran i think i 'm on my way to doing pretty well but still have room for growth			0
' @entity2 , @entity86 and @entity87 were at @entity11 as part of the ' suit up for sunday ' campaign and ahead of the second 2014 @entity139 game			1
