by @entity0 @entity2 ’s @entity1 is home to fascinating creatures , but few divers get to see the secret movements of corals			1
now one scientist has used time - lapse photography to capture the mysterious movement of corals beneath the waves			1
@entity12 ’ photographic labour of love reveals the life cycle of a coral reef , which happens too slowly for humans to see			2
it covers an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres ( 133,000 square miles )			0
the reef is located in the @entity30 , off the coast of @entity32 , @entity2			0
it can be seen from outer space and is the world 's biggest single structure made by living organisms			1
the reef structure is composed of billions of tiny organisms , known as coral polyps			0
the @entity41 considers the greatest threat to the @entity1 to be climate change , causing ocean warming which increases coral bleaching			0
@entity47 coral bleaching events due to elevated ocean temperatures occurred in the summers of 1998 , 2002 and 2006 and coral bleaching is expected to become an annual occurrence			0
the @entity1 is the world ’s largest living organism and is thought to be especially sensitive to slight fluctuations – and a gradual warming – in sea temperatures			0
dr @entity57 , of @entity59 's @entity58 , documented the colourful coral creatures over a five year period			1
he has captured the communication , movement and even violent battles that the slow - moving creatures become involved in , the @entity62 reported			1
the location of the photographic shoot was @entity69 and a short clip of a planting coral removing sediment took 11.5 hours to film and was sped up 1,800 times in a video displayed on his website			0
the intriguing sight of a mushroom coral flipping itself over is included in the video and took six hours to film , before being sped up 900 times , while footage of starfish and nudibranch coral moving took two hours before it was sped up 300 times			1
@entity12 ’ photographic labour of love reveals the life cycle of a coral reef and movement of the strange creatures , which happens too slowly for humans to see scientists have previously warned that the world 's largest coral reef - under threat from @entity2 's surging coal and gas shipments , climate change and a destructive starfish - is declining faster than ever and coral cover could fall to just 5 per cent in the next decade			1
researchers from the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) in the north eastern city of @entity103 , said @entity2 's @entity1 has lost half of its coral in little more than a generation and the pace of damage has picked up since 2006			2
globally , reefs are being assailed by myriad threats , particularly rising sea temperatures , increased ocean acidity and more powerful storms , but the threat to the @entity1 is even more pronounced , the @entity101 study found			0
dr @entity57 documented the colourful coral creatures over a five year period and captured the communication , movement and even violent battles between the slow - moving creatures @entity101 scientists studied data from more than 200 individual reefs off the @entity32 coast covering the period 1985 - 2012			1
they found cyclone damage caused nearly half the losses , crown - of - thorns starfish more than 40 per cent and coral bleaching from spikes in sea temperatures 10 per cent			2
the starfish are native and prey on the reefs , but plagues are occurring much more frequently			0
ordinarily , reefs can recover within 10 to 20 years from storms , bleachings or starfish attacks but climate change impacts slow this down			1
rising ocean acidification caused by seas absorbing more carbon dioxide is disrupting the ability of corals to build their calcium carbonate structures and hotter seas stress corals still further			2
here , a mesophotic coral reef at a depth of 40 metres was filmed for one month before being sped up 360,000 times			0

a scientist at the @entity59 's @entity58 documented corals for five years to reveal their *underwater* *activities*
@entity57 captured the communication , movement and violent battles of the slow - moving creatures
