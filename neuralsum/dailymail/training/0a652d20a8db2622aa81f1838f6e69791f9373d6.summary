miss @entity95 said the basic salary for a midwife who has worked for at least a year was £ 25,783 , which she said was ‘ about the national average ’			0
she said : ‘ you are going on strike at the expense of the people earning much less than you have			2

you should be ashamed of yourself			0

‘ the answer is that we have had very clear analysis that if we did that hospital chief executives would lay off around 4,000 nurses this year and around 10,000 nurses next year			0
‘ now , the @entity30 has just come through a terrible tragedy with @entity229 – we discovered the most appalling care happening there and indeed at some other hospitals			2
