by @entity0 the largest bird that ever flew , which had a staggering 24ft wingspan , was so heavy it would have had to take off like a hang glider			1
computer simulations have revealed that the prehistoric condor - like @entity6 could only have left the ground by taking a running jump downhill into a headwind			1
but once airborne , it would have been a highly efficient flyer , despite its extraordinary wingspan being more than twice that of the albatross - the world ’s largest flying bird today			1
this graphic shows how the enormous ' condor ' , which lived 28 million years ago , compares to modern - day birds , including the albatross , eagle , vulture , gull and sparrow			1
the @entity25 sandersi is a species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks working from a fossil skull , as well as wing and leg bones , researchers calculated the likely size of the bird , and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding			1
the fossil of the prehistoric flyer was unearthed in 1983 , in @entity43			0
it was found when construction workers began digging a new terminal at the @entity47 , and was so big they had to remove it using a @entity49			0
working from a fossil skull , as well as wing and leg bones , researchers calculated the likely size of the bird and modelled possible flight styles - including flapping and gliding			1
even though it would have weighed up to 180lbs ( 81.5kg ) , the researchers said they have no doubt @entity56 flew			1
its paper - thin hollow bones , stumpy legs and wing shape made it similar to birds that fly today , and this would have made it awkward when on land			1
its size and telltale beak suggested the creature was a previously unknown species of pelagornithid - an extinct group of giant seabirds believed to be ancestors of pelicans and storks			2
they were known for bony ‘ teeth ’ that lined their jaws			0
these giants of the sky occurred all over the globe for tens of millions of years but vanished during the @entity83 - just three million years ago			2

its paper - thin hollow bones , stumpy legs and wing shape made it similar to birds that fly today , and this would have made it awkward when on land			1
but , because it exceeded the 15ft ( 4.5 metre ) wingspan previous studies have claimed is the maximum for birds to fly , the researchers were unsure how it managed to take off and stay aloft			2

dr @entity107 , curator of science at @entity109 in @entity110 , said : ' the upper wing bone alone was longer than my arm			0

named in honour of dig leader dr @entity132 - retired curator of @entity134 where the fossil ’s housed - the bird lived 25 to 28 million years ago , after the dinosaurs died out , but long before the first humans arrived in the area			2
once airborne , computer simulations suggest the bird ’s long , slender wings made it an expert glider			1

by riding on air currents that rise up from the ocean 's surface it was able to soar for miles over the open ocean ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity154 breaks the record held by the previously known biggest flyer @entity157 magnificens - a condor - like bird that lived in the @entity160 mountains six million years ago			1
it had a wingspan of 21ft ( 6.4 metres )			2
the average albatross ( pictured ) , which is the largest flying bird today , has a wingspan of 9.8ft ( 3 metres ) once airborne , computer simulations suggest the bird ’s long , slender wings made it an expert glider			1
by riding on air currents that rise up from the ocean ’s surface it was able to soar for miles over the open ocean			0
it would have occasionally swooped down to the water to feed on soft - bodied prey like squid and eels			0

the skeleton was very well preserved - a rarity because of the paper - thin nature of the bones in these birds			0
dr @entity107 said : ' @entity191 were like creatures out of a fantasy novel - there is simply nothing like them around today			0

paleontologists remain uncertain about the cause of their demise			0
@entity154 breaks the record held by the previously known biggest flyer @entity157 magnificens - a condor - like bird that lived in the @entity160 mountains , and the pampas of @entity208 , six million years ago			2
it had a wing - span of 21ft ( 6.4 metres ) , and a computer simulation carried out seven years ago suggested it flew in a similar style .			2

@entity6 was so heavy it could get off the ground by taking a running jump downhill into a headwind - much like a hang glider
it would have weighed up to 180lbs ( 81.5kg ) with stumpy legs
the bird 's wingspan was more than twice the size of a modern albatross
scientists used computer simulations to *predict* how the bird flew
