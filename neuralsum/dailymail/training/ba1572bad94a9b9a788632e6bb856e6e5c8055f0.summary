by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:49 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 10:53 est , 16 july 2013 @entity2 today launched a blistering attack on @entity4 , branding the @entity6 leader ‘ spineless and clueless ’ for not standing up to his union paymasters			1
the @entity9 leader tore into the @entity10 after his party was branded ‘ pre-fascist ’ and ‘ xenophobic ’ in a secret report			1
and mr @entity2 brushed off a poll showing voters switching back to the @entity15 , insisting the threat he poses to the @entity15 is ‘ more psychological than arithmetical ’			1
row : @entity9 leader @entity2 tore into @entity6 leader @entity4 for not distancing himself from the @entity10 report describing @entity9 as fascist the explosive @entity10 report was written by @entity20 , who has close links with the @entity6 leadership and was @entity10 ’s political director until he left last month after a power struggle			1
the confidential report , submitted to a meeting of @entity10 ’s political committee , launches a highly provocative attack on @entity9 leader @entity2 , warning mr @entity4 not to ‘ chase ’ his party ’s votes			1
‘ the @entity9 vote represents a dangerous , populist right - wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and @entity37 rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed , ’ it states			1
‘ these are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that @entity9 is fascist , because it is n’t , but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them			1
’ warning : @entity20 , a recent @entity10 political director , wrote the key report slamming @entity9 @entity10 has given @entity6 more than £ 8million since mr @entity4 became leader in 2010			1
today mr @entity2 condemned the criticism of @entity9 , insisting it was evidence ‘ all that is wrong with the @entity52 of @entity54 politics ’			1
writing for @entity1 , mr @entity2 said he had previously urged mr @entity4 to ‘ condemn inflammatory , narrow minded and provocative behaviour ’ by @entity56 at a @entity9 public meeting in @entity58			1
‘ the reply simply never came			0
it suits the spineless and clueless @entity6 leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that @entity9 is somehow xenophobic or dangerous			1
‘ the only danger we pose is to the other three parties , who have for too long ignored @entity54 voters			2
’ @entity67 's @entity10 has become embroiled in a bitter row with the @entity6 over allegations that the union tried to fix candidate selection in @entity72			1
it prompted mr @entity4 to announce an overhaul of @entity6 's union links , including ending the automatic payment of £ 9million in political levies into party coffers			1
it has also emerged that @entity6 has suspended two local councillors who are accused of paying for people to join the party			2
following a meeting last night , @entity81 and @entity82 , who sit on @entity83 , were placed on ' administrative suspension '			0
it is claimed that the pair recruited people to join the @entity6 after paying their initial subscription fees			2
in a sign that the row is damaging @entity6 , a new opinion poll last night put the party neck and neck with the @entity15 on 36 per cent			1
while the @entity15 were up seven points , @entity9 was done five points to just seven the @entity97 believe they have countered some of @entity9 ’s appeal by backing legislation paving the way for a referendum on @entity54 ’s membership of the @entity104 to take place by the end of 2017			1
the @entity15 were also boosted by home secretary @entity108 ’s success in finally getting hate preacher @entity109 deported to @entity110			2
but mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ one deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make			0
’ he blames the opinion poll on the fact that pollsters @entity116 do not name @entity9 when asking people how they will vote			1
' most of the pollsters do n’t know how to handle @entity9 , and neither do the political establishment			2
in some respects , they are all doing us a favour			0
‘ the arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the @entity54 sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the @entity130 gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views , ’ he added			2
the leaked @entity10 report sadly underscores all that is wrong with the @entity52 of @entity54 politics			1
when i wrote to @entity4 after the protest organised by @entity56 at the @entity9 public meeting in @entity58 , i would have expected a responsible party leader to condemn inflammatory , narrow minded and provocative behaviour against valid political debate			2
the reply simply never came			0
it suits the spineless and clueless @entity6 leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that @entity9 is somehow xenophobic or dangerous			1
the only danger we pose is to the other three parties , who have for too long ignored @entity54 voters			0
what we are looking at is the left wing of @entity54 politics trying to control the views of their voters , particularly among blue collar workers , while at the same time ignoring their voice			0
this is a left wing that feels it has an automatic right to that vote , and can not bear the idea that another party is gaining credence			0
this is a left wing that can not fathom that it has ever done anything wrong despite senior @entity6 figures revealing that they openly courted @entity173 workers to come to the @entity54 in their hundreds of thousands			2
the report describes the @entity9 vote as having the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements			1
what he is either naively or arrogantly failing to identify is that @entity9 is the solution to the problem , not the problem itself			2
what he calls ‘ the @entity9 vote ’ is a society that feels let down ; a society that wants to rise up against a democratic deficit			1
history has shown us that all too often such a vacuum is easily filled by opportunistic and unsavoury political elements that play upon long ignored societal issues and dissatisfaction to further their own ill ends			0
the political class should be grateful that a responsible , reasonable and rational political power is representing the unheard voices underpinning this discontent			0
in the battle against fascism , @entity9 is far and above the best medicine			2
in the @entity54 , and indeed across @entity202 , people have felt unrepresented and ignored for too long , while great change such as mass immigration set against a backdrop of economic turmoil has not only been ignored but wilfully swept under the carpet			0
yet instead of reading the signs , @entity10 and the @entity6 instead obsess over their self - preservation			1
where voters are turning to @entity9 , they wish to discredit and destroy our party , rather than seeking to understand the needs of the people increasingly identifying with our policies			2
the problem , to them , is @entity9			2
not the fact that they are not listening to the electorate , whereas we are			0
but it 's not just the @entity6 who are missing the point about the @entity9 surge			1
today 's @entity116 poll showing - astonishingly - the @entity15 and @entity6 on 36 per cent is a symptom of a political class more interested in polling data backing up their pre conceived views			1
just as the media have their favourite political parties , polling companies now lean towards their own politics with the results being skewed in favour of the paymaster 's allegiance			0
just as a bookmaker at a race course would slash the odds on a favourite horse to encourage punters to put their money on the least risky option , political parties want voters to go with the same urge of ' backing the favourite '			0
i 've often said i thought the effect of @entity9 on the @entity97 was more psychological than arithmetical but when political parties rely on manipulated data sets they risk once again ignoring what gets people voting @entity9			0
it 's not a risk for me , of course			0
it 's always been @entity9 's unique selling point that we actually listen to the people rather than convince ourselves that the public think we 've all the answers and nothing to improve upon			0
because what happens is that election time comes as a bitter disappointment			0
i 'm not taking the @entity116 poll to heart today despite calls from many quarters saying that the @entity15 have effectively managed to ' squeeze @entity9 out '			1
one deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make			0
if the data had been from a pollster who prompted @entity9 in the first round maybe i 'd be more concerned but the figure they have @entity9 on , 7 per cent , is the same figure they polled us at a mere two months before our best ever election result , scoring an average of 25 per cent where we stood			0
most of the pollsters do n’t know how to handle @entity9 , and neither do the political establishment			0
in some respects , they are all doing us a favour			0
the arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the @entity54 sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the @entity130 gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views			0
we are not afraid to talk about immigration and the @entity104 , even if we must suffer the name calling and abuse , for we understand how important these issues are to any society			0
these last few weeks , both @entity10 and the @entity6 have demonstrated a distasteful and corrupt obsession with forcibly trying to dominate the political landscape , by any means			1
it is time the @entity307 stopped focusing on their selves and started waking up to what the people of @entity54 really want			0
this blind , narrow minded hostility towards @entity9 is a blind narrow minded hostility towards @entity54 itself .			0

secret report by @entity10 branded @entity9 ‘ pre-fascist ’ and ‘ xenophobic ’
@entity317 has given @entity6 £ 8million since @entity318 became leader
new poll *suggests* voters are switching back to the @entity15
