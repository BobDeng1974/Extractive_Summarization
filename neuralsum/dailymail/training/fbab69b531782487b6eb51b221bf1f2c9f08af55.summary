by @entity0 published : 18:00 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 18:00 est , 10 may 2013 referendum vote : mr @entity2 will allow ministers a free vote next week when eurosceptics force a vote on the failure to include legislation on an @entity10 referendum in the @entity12 's speech @entity2 is allowing senior cabinet ministers to back an @entity10 referendum @entity15 and vote against the @entity16			1
eurosceptic mps will next week force a vote condemning the @entity16 for failing to include legislation on a referendum			1
the prime minister will be on a visit to the @entity24 but he has given colleagues a free vote on the issue			2
eurosceptic ministers including @entity31 @entity30 , environment secretary @entity32 , and even foreign secretary @entity33 , are among at least 100 conservatives who may support the move , sources said			2
labour leader @entity37 will today announce that @entity38 will not back an in / out referendum on @entity40 , in a move that will dash the hopes of many of his own mps who think he should match mr @entity2 ’s pledge to hold a referendum after the next election			1
in a reference to @entity51 leader @entity50 , he will accuse mr @entity2 of trying to ‘ out - @entity52 on @entity54 ’s membership of the @entity10 ’			1
he will say that the prime minister is ‘ wrong ’ to have announced that an in / out referendum will take place and will insist that @entity54 must stay in the @entity10			1
although mr @entity2 is said to be ‘ relaxed ’ about next week ’s vote , it will be unprecedented for members of the @entity61 to criticise the @entity16 , which they are responsible for writing , in a parliamentary vote			1
the situation has come about because the @entity65 can not bring forward a @entity15 to reinforce mr @entity2 ’s pledge of a referendum in late 2017 or early 2018 after a renegotiation of @entity54 ’s membership , since it is not supported by the @entity70			2
but @entity71 eurosceptics believe the party should underscore the commitment by attempting to introduce legislation , even if it is voted down by the @entity70 and @entity38			1
vote : @entity30 and @entity33 are among 100 @entity71 mps expected to support the move next week they have tabled an amendment that states that the @entity79 ‘ respectfully regrets that an @entity10 referendum bill was not included in the @entity16 ’			1
though next week ’s vote will be largely symbolic , it is expected to be followed by a bill tabled by backbenchers			2
@entity86 sources indicated that mps and ministers may be allowed to vote in favour of that as well			2
tv presenter @entity91 ( pictured ) threw his weight behind @entity51 yesterday and said he had penned a song to celebrate			0
the former @entity95 host revealed he voted for the @entity97 party in last week ’s local elections , although he admitted it was an act of protest			2
and – in a tongue - in - cheek reference to @entity103 ’s description of @entity51 candidates as clowns – he rewrote the lyrics to the @entity108 classic send in the clowns			0
mr @entity91 ’s new lyrics include the verse : ‘ we used to be rich / now we are not / but here at last there ’s a chance / to stop all the rot / send in the clowns			0
’ his backing is another boost for @entity51 , which received around a quarter of the vote			0
@entity51 leader @entity50 pledged to lead a rendition of mr @entity91 ’s song at the party ’s next conference			0
and it is thought the prime minister might vote himself in favour of a private member ’s @entity15 on the issue which is expected to be unveiled within weeks , though it stands no chance of becoming law without @entity38 and @entity70 support			1
@entity134 mayor @entity133 , mr @entity2 ’s chief rival , yesterday said the prime minister ’s approach was ‘ completely right ’			0
he said : ‘ what we need to do is to say to our friends and partners : “ listen chums , this thing is n’t working for either of us ”			0
‘ we need a renegotiation			0
we need to look at the way the thing is managed			0
’ the @entity134 mayor said he would only vote to stay in the @entity10 if there was a ‘ substantial improvement ’ when @entity54 renegotiates its relationship with @entity40			1
‘ if you get rid of a lot of the barnacles that have accreted around business thanks to @entity10 regulation and legislation over the last 30 or 40 years , then i ’d be content to stay in the single market			1
‘ but if not , then we should be absolutely clear that we ’ve got to be ready to walk away			0
’ @entity71 mp @entity157 said that ‘ a very large number ’ of mps would support next week ’s @entity10 referendum amendment to the @entity16			1
‘ there are 81 conservative mps who rebelled on the @entity10 referendum issue last time			1
i would n’t be surprised if the number is in excess of 100 , ’ he said			0
‘ the prime minister is making it quite clear that he wants to have a referendum by the end of 2017 , provided he wins			0
we have to hold his feet to the flames to make sure that comes about			0
’ @entity173 , chairman of the @entity40 scrutiny committee , said : ‘ we need a referendum this side of the general election			0

eurosceptic mps will force vote on @entity10 referendum law next week
they will condemn @entity12 's speech for failing to include plans for legislation
@entity37 will say today that @entity38 will not back in / out referendum
