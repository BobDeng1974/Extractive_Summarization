surgery to reconstruct women the clitorises of women who have been circumcised is becoming increasingly common surgery to restore function in women 's clitorises is becoming increasingly common to help those who have suffered female genital mutilation			1
the procedure offers hope women who have had their clitorises circumcised , and who suffer painful side effects and a loss of sexual pleasure as a result surgeons carrying out the procedure say the operation could stop pain , help women feel sexual pleasure and restore their identity and femininity			1
worldwide , the @entity25 estimates that over 133 million women have been subjected to female genital mutilation ( @entity28 )			2
while surgeons in the @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and various countries in @entity36 offer the operation , last month a @entity30 surgeon successfully reconstructed a clitoris for the first time			1
the procedure can be performed because the clitoris is much larger than most people assume , dr @entity43 , the surgeon who performed the operation , told vice			1
‘ the clitoris is n't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible , ’ dr @entity43 , of @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity30 told vice journalist @entity48			1
‘ so the point of my method is to carefully remove scar tissue and reveal the part of the clitoris that 's still there , mobilise it forward and put it in its place			1
’ the clitoris has a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina , and when @entity28 is carried out , only the visible part of the clitoris is cut off			1
this means surgeons are able to remove the scar tissue , pull the remaining parts of clitoris – which also feels sensation - to the front of the vagina to rebuild a working organ			1
in some cases , the perpetrators have performed a procedure called infibulation , dr @entity43 said			2
this is where the clitoris is removed and the labia are stitched together to form a cover over the vagina			1
a small hole is left for urine , menstruation , childbirth and intercourse			0
therefore surgeons must first surgically open the vaginal orifice , dr @entity43 said			0
while he can not ever fully restore the genitalia to how they would have been before the woman was mutilated , plenty of parts in the genital area can be re-created , he said			2
he continued : ‘ we can open the vagina up again and we can recreate the clitoris and the clitoris hood			2
the clitoris is n't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible			1
it is much longer than most people assume , beyond the visible tip , there is a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina beneath the surface			0
this means in order to reconstruct the clitoris , surgeons remove the the scar tissue and pull the remaining parts of clitoris to the front of the vagina , stitching it up			1
as the whole clitoris feels sensation - not just the tip - they are able to rebuild a working organ			0
‘ we can also in some cases recreate the labia minora ( the inner ‘ lips ’ of the vagina )			0
’ ‘ the method is being developed and is getting better with time , research and experience			0
‘ but it will always be hard to restore someone 's mutilated genitals 100 per cent			0
’ he added that clitoral reconstruction is not just about the physical repair of the genitalia , the psychological aspect is just as vital			0
he said : ‘ the most important thing when treating women and girls who have been victims of female genital mutilation is for plastic surgeons , gynaecologists , sexologists and psychotherapists to work together			1
‘ it is only with a multidisciplinary approach that these women can see improvement in their quality of life and experience less pain			0
’ dr @entity151 , a @entity32 surgeon who has carried out hundreds of procedures since 2009 , said the number one reason women undergo the operation is to restore their identity			2
‘ women who have been cut feel their sense of womanhood has been stolen from them and they want that back , ’ she told @entity159 journalists			0
‘ they want their body back and to feel more normal			0
it ’s about not being different any more			0
’ the most common side effects of the procedure , according to the available research , are bleeding and infections , which affect around three to five per cent of women			2
most of the women who undergo the procedure experience less pain and more sensation in their reconstructed clitoris after the surgery			1
surgeons say the surgery can prevent pain , restore sexual function and the identity of women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation but a minority , less than five per cent , feel less sensation afterwards – a risk dr @entity43 said he makes clear to all patients			1
the technique to restore function in the clitoris was developed only a decade ago , pioneered by @entity33 urologist and surgeon @entity193			1
reconstructive surgery to repair the physical damage of @entity28 is not a new phenomenon , but the procedure is becoming more common as more women become aware of it			2
the market for this surgery is less niche than one might assume , dr @entity43 said			0
the @entity203 estimates that 19,000 women in @entity30 are in the risk zone of getting mutilated			2
dr @entity43 said : ‘ worldwide , reliable sources such as the @entity25 and @entity207 report that over 133 million women have been subjects to female genital mutilation			0
‘ three million young girls are mutilated every year			0
so the demand for this kind of surgery is huge			0

operations to restore clitoral function are becoming increasingly common
@entity30 surgeon reconstructed a clitoris for the first time last month
@entity222 helps female circumcision victims feel sexual pleasure and less pain
usually in circumcision only the visible part of the clitoris is removed
this procedure removes scar tissue and brings rest of clitoris forward
