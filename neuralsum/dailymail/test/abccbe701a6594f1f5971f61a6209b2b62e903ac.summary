a @entity1 prostitute says that she wishes other people would n't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job			1
@entity5 , who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career , insists she is neither ' damaged ' nor ' deranged ' - that , in fact , she rather enjoys being a prostitute , and it 's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy			1
' i am embarrassed to be a sex worker , even though i like my job , i ’m good at it , and i ’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years , ' she wrote in a recent essay for @entity21			1
this pro has pride : @entity1 prostitute @entity5 , pictured here , wishes other people would n't make her feel embarrassed about her job first , @entity5 would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they 've made about prostitutes			1
she claims that she did n't have an abusive childhood , she 's not a ' hyper - sexual nympho ' , and she is n't uneducated			2
she had ' an incredibly fortunate upbringing ' , she said , adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister : ' [ it was ] just about the best any child could possibly hope for			0
' then , as a 19 - year - old college sophomore , she found herself in need of a way to pay for school			2
a minimum - wage job would n't earn her enough money , and she did n't want to take out student loans			2
her best option , she said , was the sex industry			2
' i could n’t bring myself to do porn , and i knew was n’t talented enough to be a stripper , ' she explained			0
working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for @entity5 , as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills			1
it just did n't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision			0
in the beginning , she 'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part - time work			2
she was still out - going then , she said , and never felt self - conscious			0
but peoples ' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job			2
they would lecture her , insult her , and accuse her of being a ' traitor to feminism '			0
one friend told everyone in their social circle that @entity5 must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career , and might have even been molested as a child			1
the rumor took off , and @entity5 lost a lot of friends in the process			1
now , after about a decade in the industry , she is much more reticent about revealing what she does , for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions			0
but while she has a ' mainstream ' part - time job that she uses as a ' cover ' , she finds it frustrating that she ca n't be more open			0
' i wish i could feel proud of who i am and what i do , ' she said			1
' i ’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed			0
' sexy and smart : @entity5 , who wants to keep her real identity a secret , says she 's more than just an escort - she also has her master 's degree in sociology even when she does tell people about her work as an escort , @entity5 makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master ’s degree in sociology : ' i hype it up and draw attention to it , as if to say , “ yes , i ’m a [ prostitute ] , but i ’m also smart and normal , really , i promise ! ” ' because of the social stigma , she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy , her schedule is flexible , and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study			1
plus , she explained , she ca n't erase her history in the sex industry			0
' i will always be seen as damaged goods , whether i am a current sex worker or a former one			0
so i might as well just keep going , right ? ' in fact , despite liking her job , it 's not @entity1 's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give @entity5 pause - being paid for sex is legal , but living off that payment of it is not			1
rather , it 's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all			1
' i wish i ’d known what i was getting myself into before i jumped into this line of work , ' she said			0
' but most of all , i wish i ’d never become a prostitute in the first place			0

@entity5 , from @entity1 , became an escort when she was in college
she wants to feel proud of her job , but complains that she is constantly *battling* the negative opinions of others
the *writer* , who uses a pseudonym , has her master 's degree but explains that sex work pays more than jobs in her field of study
