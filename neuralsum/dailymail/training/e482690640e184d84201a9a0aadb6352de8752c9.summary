by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 13:20 est , 29 may 2012 a mother who was given 18 months to live after doctors failed to diagnose her cancer more than a dozen times has made a miracle recovery after the first operation of its kind in the @entity9			1
@entity10 , 47 , was repeatedly turned away by medics over the course of two years despite suffering from the classic symptoms of bowel cancer			1
by the time the disease was diagnosed , she was told she had just 18 months left to live as a tumour in her bowel had grown so large it was almost inoperable			1
on the mend : but @entity10 was repeatedly turned away by doctors over the course of two years despite suffering from the classic symptoms of bowel cancer ms @entity10 's only option was a £ 100,000 operation only available in the @entity25 and which was certain to leave her paralysed from the waist down			1
but at the eleventh hour a team of @entity9 doctors trained in the @entity25 technique agreed to carry out her surgery in a 13 - hour operation never before carried out in the @entity9			1
and to her elation , when ms @entity10 came round from the surgery she was able to wiggle her toes - meaning doctors had , against the odds , managed to save the feeling in her legs			1
ms @entity10 , who lives in @entity40 , @entity41 , with her son @entity42 , 11 , said : ' i feel like i have been given a second chance at life			1
' when you ’re told you have cancer the first thing you think is that you are going to die			2
leaving @entity42 behind was all that i could think about			0
who would look after him ? what would happen to him ? ' now he tells everyone he meets that @entity52 has n’t got cancer any more , whether he knows them or not - it ’s wonderful			2
' early bowel cancer may have no symptoms			1
initial symptoms can also occur in people with less serious problems such as haemorrhoids			2
however , the @entity61 recommends seeing your doctor if you notice the following : as the disease progresses it can also cause anaemia leading to fatigue and breathlessness			2
if you are worried about any symptoms you can also call the @entity72 line on 0800 8403540 ms @entity10 ’s health problems began in 2008 when she noticed blood in her stools and had difficulty going to the toilet			1
she went to her gp but , as her symptoms worsened , she was given varying diagnoses from doctors who claimed she had everything from @entity83 to pelvic inflammatory disease			2
at one point , ms @entity10 was suffering from such severe abdominal pain that she could barely walk			1
but she was still told go home , have hot baths and eat different foods			0
when she became so ill she could no longer eat , one doctor prescribed ms @entity10 a herbal remedy and wrote that she was ' neurotic ' in her notes			1
even when she told medics she thought she had bowel cancer her fears were laughed off and she was told she was far too young			1
by the time she was eventually diagnosed , ms @entity10 ’s cancer had been missed on 13 separate occasions and two years had passed , allowing the tumour that was growing from her bowel to progress			1
following chemotherapy and radiotherapy , it was discovered the 8cm - long growth was wrapped around her tailbone - or sacrum - and the surgery to remove it was far too complicated to be performed by @entity9 surgeons , or so she was told			1
even if ms @entity10 were to undergo the £ 100,000 sacrectomy operation , which was available privately in the @entity25 , she would almost certainly be left paralysed			1
without the operation , she was told she had a maximum of 18 months left to live			1
ms @entity10 after the 13 - hour operation at @entity112 which was carried out by a team of @entity9 doctors trained in an @entity25 technique never before carried out in the @entity9 ' second chance at life ' : ms @entity10 lives in @entity40 , @entity41 , with her son @entity42 , 11 ms @entity10 said : ' i did n’t care what happened to me , i just wanted to still be around for my son			1
i was n’t even angry because i was more worried about @entity42 to feel anything else			0
' but they could n’t find anyone in this country who was qualified to do the sacrectomy			0
only about 50 operations are performed anywhere in the world each year			0
' the tumour had spread so far up my tailbone that no one was prepared to do it as they had never performed one like it before			0
it was a very complex operation and had a lot of risks			2
essentially they would be cutting away at the root of my spine			0
before the operation , well - wishers at @entity144 in @entity40 paid for ms @entity10 to take @entity42 to @entity146 , where he met singer @entity147 relief : ms @entity10 recovering after the operation that she thought would leave her paralysed ' but even though i was told it would most likely leave me paralysed , i was desperate to find someone to do it			1
i started trying to raise the £ 100,000 to go to @entity25 myself and contacted everyone i knew			1
' after months of frantic fundraising , ms @entity10 finally received the call she had been waiting for - orthopaedic surgeon professor @entity157 and consultant neurosurgeon dr @entity159 had agreed to take on her case with another surgeon at @entity162			1
earlier this month it emerged that a critically - acclaimed @entity9 composer has been left wheelchair bound after a hospital misdiagnosed his fractured spine			2
medical staff at the @entity169 in @entity170 failed to diagnose @entity171 ' fractured back after the 61 - year - old suffered a fall at home in october 2009			2
his case is one of several high - profile blunders where medics misdiagnosed patients ' conditions			2
in january this year a mother sued the obstetrician who she claims misdiagnosed her pregnancy as ectopic and injected her foetus with an abortant , resulting in birth defects			0
thirty - five - year - old @entity187 of @entity188 , @entity189 , says she was four weeks five days pregnant with her daughter , @entity190 , when her doctor injected her foetus with chemotherapy drug methotrexate in 2006			2
two weeks later , the baby was found inside the uterus			0
and against all odds , @entity190 made it through term			2
a survey last month revealed that two thirds of young people with cancer will visit their gp with at least one of the most common cancer symptoms - yet a third of these cases are missed by doctors , according to research			1
one in four had to visit their doctor at least four times before they were taken seriously and referred to a specialist			0
@entity213 , 17 , from the @entity214 , was only diagnosed with a muscle tumour when her mother took her to hospital after she was turned away by her gp three times			2
of those who were at first misdiagnosed , 12 per cent were told they were attention seeking while 15 per cent were told they just had a virus			0
other misdiagnoses included telling patients they were suffering indigestion , vertigo or swine flu			2
together the three surgeons worked for 13 hours to remove ms @entity10 ’s sacrum , her bowel , her womb and to repair damage to her kidneys			1
the surgery was described as being akin to a car crash in physical terms			0
ms @entity10 was also warned once more that the surgery would probably leave her without the use of the lower half of her body , but she was determined to go ahead			1
she said : ' as far as i was concerned , there was no choice to make			0
the surgery was my only chance of survival and i had to fight for my survival			0
' before the op , kind well - wishers at @entity144 in @entity40 paid for @entity10 to take her son to @entity146 for what she feared might be the last quality time she would ever spend with him			1
then , on march 12 this year , ms @entity10 awoke from the operation			1
she said : ' when i woke up from the surgery i was completely elated			0
i could wiggle my toes and i could feel my legs so i knew that meant they ’d been able to save one of my nerves			0
' i felt terrible , but i ’d never been happier			0
the doctors explained to me that the surgery had gone better than they had expected , that they ’d removed all the tumour and been able to spare the feeling in my legs			1
i could n’t thank them enough			0
' ms @entity10 spent the next two weeks in hospital and then returned home to @entity40 where she is learning to walk again on crutches			1
doctors can not say if the cancer will ever return but as far as she is concerned , her recovery is miraculous			2
ms @entity10 said : ' i was terminal			1
i was written off as dead			0
i ca n’t believe i ’ve been given another chance to go on living and being a mother to my son			0
' i am angry at the fact it took so long to diagnose me			0
i think the sad fact is that the @entity61 is under too much strain financially and the doctors were reluctant to take me seriously because of my age			0
' but if they had given me a blood test or a colonoscopy four years ago i would have saved them thousands			0
' what i would say to anyone is that they need to be aware of their own bodies and if you know something is n’t right - even if a doctor is telling you that you are fine - get a second opinion and be persistent			0
' having said that , the surgeons that worked on me were incredible and the care i received from them was amazing			0
' they have saved my life and my mobility			0
i can get from a to b and i still have my independence so i do n’t mind if i wobble a little , i get there in the end			0
' i have to take everything one day at a time and no one can tell me what the future holds but i ’m so grateful that i ’m still here			0
' most importantly , i ’m still here for @entity42 and that ’s what matters			0
' ms @entity10 is raising funds and awareness for bowel cancer			1
