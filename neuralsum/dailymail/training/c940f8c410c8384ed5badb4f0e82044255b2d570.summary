are you desperate to lose weight but constantly hungry when dieting ? does the thought of going to the gym fill you with dread ? a new diet promises to avoid all of this – while allowing you to eat foods traditionally banned on weight loss plans			1
called @entity10 , it claims to facilitate up to 10lb of weight loss in just 14 days			1
developed by nutritionist and personal trainer @entity14 , the diet is a combination of high - fat nutrition and high - intensity training			1
the premise is that rather than fat being demonised , it actually makes you thinner			2
in a nutshell , you need to eat fat to get rid of fat			0
‘ some lose as much as 12lb ( 5.4 kg ) ’ , she says			0
and , as the plan is designed to help reset the hormonal balance of the body , she claims it ’s also easy to keep the weight off			1
in a new book about the plan , ms @entity14 says : ' it literally turns every ­ thing you thought you knew about weight loss on its head			2
' forget counting calories , feeling hungry , hours of exercise or months of watching the scales slowly shift downwards , and forget bran or anything else that tastes like cardboard			0
' instead , those on the plan eat plenty of high - fat foods - like nuts , avocado , butter and even cream cheese			1
they also do a maximum of 12 minutes of exercise a day - none of which is on a running machine or exercise bike			1
here , in an extract from the book , @entity10 , the authors explain the science ... those on the plan eat plenty of high - fat foods - such as nuts , avocados , butter and even cream cheese @entity79 makes you thinner the reason the diet works is the impact fat has on a hormone called insulin			1
released when you eat , insulin 's job is to shuttle glucose , the sugar our body normally uses for energy , into cells where it can be used as fuel			0
how much insulin you produce depends on which foods you consume			0
sugar and carbohydrates ( which your body converts quickly into glucose ) produce the highest level			0
protein , which takes a bit more effort to turn into glucose , creates a smaller rise			0
you lose weight : on average 6 - 8 lb ( 2.7 - 3.6 kg ) in two weeks			2
you lose inches : usually 1 - 3 inches ( 2.5 - 7.5cm ) off the tummy and waist and more elsewhere			0
your skin looks amazing : fat plumps up skin and by the end of the plan you could find your skin is glowing and fine lines and wrinkles have virtually disappeared			2
dietary fat , however , takes a few complicated steps to convert to glucose and therefore does n't trigger any direct rise in insulin at all			2
swap to a diet that consists of a lot of high - fat foods and very few carbohydrates and you create a situation where insulin is low and you remove your body 's normal source of fuel			1
at this point it has to do something to get the energy it needs , and that something is to switch to using fat instead ( a state scientists call ketosis )			0
every time a little bit of fat leaves the cells to be used as energy the fat cells get smaller and lighter - and so do you			2
the @entity146 hunger is a common reason people find diets hard to stick to , but it 's very hard to be hungry eating just fat and protein			1
one reason is that ketones released as you start to burn fat suppress appetite			0
the combination also avoids sudden peaks and troughs in blood sugar that cause food cravings			0
finally , fat digests slowly , keeping you fuller longer			0
can you imagine what difference that would make to eradicating 3pm sugar cravings ? fat is also mentally satisfying			2
we enjoy eating it and many people on low - fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers			1
fat is also mentally satisfying , claim the experts behind the diet			1
' humans are programmed to enjoy eating it and many people on low - fat diets miss the creamy sensation it offers , ' they say combining the physical effects on blood sugar - and the psychological boost of being able to eat a food most of us enjoy - can make diets containing fat more satisfying and easier to stick to than low - fat regimes			1
but is it ok to eat all this fat ? well , much of the fat you 're eating on the plan comes from sources of unsaturated fat that no expert is going to argue are bad for you - avocados , walnuts , oily fish and olive oil however , you are also adding in foods like butter , cream cheese , red meat and full - fat cheese , which contain saturated fat			1
for the last 65 years , intake of saturated fat has been blamed for high cholesterol , heart disease , obesity and more			2
however , a number of scientists and cardiologists are now disputing this			0
last year , for example , @entity217 scientists analysed a group of 72 studies looking into the risk of saturated fat and heart disease			0
this revealed no difference in heart - disease risk between those consuming the highest and lowest intakes of saturated fat			2
this led the researchers to suggest more trials are needed to confirm officially whether saturated fat is good or bad			0
all calories are not equal a strange thing happens when you eat lots of fat that seems to boost weight - loss results			1
on our high - fat plan you could be eating 1,500 to 2,500 calories a day and still lose about 1/2 lb a day ( often far more ) – that ’s more than should be theoretically possible			1
experts call this ' the metabolic advantage '			0
this describes the anomaly that when you eat a high percentage of calories from fat in a diet , you seem to increase the number of calories you can consume yet still lose weight			1
the @entity10 by @entity14 and @entity255 ( @entity256 , £ 7.99 ) and the exercise ? high - intensity workouts , lasting 10 - 15 minutes , have been validated by numerous studies as one of the most effective ways of not only decreasing body fat - but also increasing muscle mass , strength , performance and endurance			1
this type of training helps stimulate muscle fibres , increases metabolism post workout and activates release of a muscle - building and fat - burning hormone called human growth hormone ( @entity275 )			1
when it comes to body sculpting , @entity275 is vital			0
to produce the highest @entity275 levels though , scientists say there are three key things you need to do : 1			0
train using large muscle groups 2			0
train at a high intensity - that means with heavy weights or at speed 3			1
train with the shortest rest intervals between sets so that 's the type of plan you 're going to be doing			0
no wonder you only need 12 minutes daily to get results - you 're working hard and working effectively			2
but do n't be fooled : just because it 's short , does n't mean it 's easy			0
the @entity10 by @entity14 and @entity255 ( @entity256 , £ 7.99 ) for more information : @entity298 , @ thehighfatdiet * * please note : because the diet alters insulin it should not be done by type 1 diabetics without close medical supervision .			1

the @entity10 promises to avoid the dreaded diet hunger pangs
involves eating plenty of butter , oily fish , cream cheese , avocados , nuts
authors claim that fat does not cause a spike in insulin , *unlike* carbs
and that eating fat will actually make you thin - and help keep weight off
plan is combined with just a few minutes of high intensity training a day
