conservative - run @entity2 is planning to fork out the money for the replica ceremonial chain to protect the current ' irreplaceable ' gold regalia from getting damaged or lost			1
the mayor 's current chain is worth £ 25,000 and taxpayers have been left baffled at the decision to spend so much on a fake version , having managed with the current one for 140 years			1
councillor @entity5 would don the new gold - plated ceremonial wear for ' out - of - hours ' engagements such as public appearances and charity events across the @entity27 town , if it is bought			1
@entity28 , chief executive of the @entity29 today branded the move ' ridiculous '			0
he said : ' @entity32 residents will be staggered that town council leaders think that now is the right time to buy a replica chain , after presumably coping without one for nearly 140 years			1
' £ 10,000 is an eye - wateringly large sum to spend on such frippery when budgets are so tight			2
' anyone spending taxpayers ' money needs to ensure that they are delivering value with every penny in the budget and after this ridiculous waste of money @entity32 residents will seriously question the town council 's sense of priorities			2
' councillor @entity5 said although no money had yet been spent , the council had decided to get quotes to see how much the replica would cost			1
he said : ' the council wanted to go and get three quotes			2
we could , if we wanted to , spend up to £ 10,000 without bringing it back to the council			2
' he said the council was still waiting for the third quote			0
he said : ' when we get the third quote it will go back to the committee who will then make a decision on whether or not we go along with it , but we have n't spent a single penny yet			0
' @entity69 : councillor @entity5 ( pictured left wearing the original ) will don the new gold - plated ceremonial wear for ' out - of - hours ' engagements			1
pictured right is @entity73 @entity75 group leader @entity74 said his party regretted backing the decision , which was made last year			1
@entity78 said : ' my feeling is if the @entity75 group had looked at this again we probably would have voted differently			0
' while fellow @entity75 councillor @entity84 , who represents the @entity86 ward , added : ' we 're seeing here how the council is struggling to balance budgets and my concern is whether this is the right time to be spending a lot of money on a piece of fake regalia			0
' @entity75 councillor @entity95 said : ' we understand that the last thing people want to see in these hard times is money spent on putting a chain around someone 's neck			0
' defence : council leader councillor @entity104 has defended the decision , saying it went through full council meetings and opposition had only recently arisen locals in the small market town also expressed their disbelief at the ' waste ' of taxpayers ' money			1
mechanic and father - of - four @entity117 , 50 , said : ' there are dozens of other issues that need addressing in this town that money should be spent on rather than something which is there for vanity reasons			0
' i can not believe this decision			0
it 's not even that much cheaper than the real one			0
' council leader councillor @entity104 has defended the decision			1
he said : ' our civic regalia is irreplaceable			0
' the chain dates to 1874			0
if you compare it to other towns it is second to none			0
' without cutting anything else from the budget and without raising council tax , we decided to look at the possibility of creating a replica			1
' that went through the full council meetings and there was no opposition until now			2

@entity2 plans to buy replica to protect the original
mayor will wear the chain for ' out - of - hours ' engagements
conservative - run council says there had been no opposition ' until now '
