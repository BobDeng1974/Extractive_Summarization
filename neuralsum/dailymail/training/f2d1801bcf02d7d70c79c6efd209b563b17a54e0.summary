by @entity0 research into three bird flu victims in @entity3 has raised grim fears that the 11 deaths so far are just the tip of the iceberg			2
scientists found that the vicious new strain has the potential to pass more easily into humans and remain undetected until it is at an advanced stage			2
the research into three people , all of whom died , showed the disease causes pneumonia , septic shock , brain damage and multi-organ failure			0
it came as officials in a region of @entity3 culled chickens in a bid to stop the spread of a new strain of bird flu which claimed its tenth victim in the country yesterday			1
prevention : a city management officer kills a chicken as his colleagues stand by in a residential neighbourhood of @entity36 , @entity37 province a group of city management force conducted a two - day campaign , capturing and slaughtering poultry raised in local residential areas of @entity36 a city management officer holds a chicken as a boy rides past in a residential neighbourhood yesterday city management officers in the @entity36 area of @entity37 province undertook a two day campaign which saw chickens captured and reared in residential areas were captured and killed to try and prevent the @entity55 virus from spreading			1
the campaign came as a 74 - year - old @entity57 man became the tenth person in the country to die from the mutated form of the virus			1
@entity3 researchers warned yesterday that the sudden emergence of this strain of flu ' may pose a serious human health risk ' and said ' appropriate counter measures were urgently required			1
' @entity69 authorities also announced plans to test all poultry brought in from the mainland			2
the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) has said that the cases of infection of the virus in @entity3 are the first in the world			2
the source of the virus has not yet been identified and the @entity73 say that there is no evidence as yet of human to human transmission			1
the organisation has called for good hygiene practices to be adhered to as a precaution			0
to date , @entity3 has seen 38 confirmed cases of the disease including cases in @entity91 , @entity37 and @entity57			1
of those cases , 19 are said to be severe cases and nine are described as mild			0
more than 750 close contacts of those affected are currently undergoing tests for the virus			0
urban management officers wear masks as they catch chickens close to a block of houses yesterday tourists wear masks as a precaution walk in @entity107 a group of scientists writing in the @entity110 said the virus , which has been traced to a reassortment of genes from wild birds in east @entity115 and chickens in east @entity3 , ' raises many urgent questions and global public health concerns '			1
the reports chronicle the early days of an outbreak of a new influenza a virus , @entity55 , never before been seen in humans			2
it has infected at least 40 people in four @entity3 provinces and killed 11 in the past two months , @entity3 authorities said			2
scientists studied three patients included two men , ages 87 and 27 , both from @entity57 , and a 35 - year - old woman from @entity131			1
dr. @entity132 and dr. @entity133 , both of the influenza division at the @entity135 , wrote : ' it is possible that these severely ill patients represent the tip of the iceberg			0
' they said it is particularly concerning because the virus has genetic characteristics that suggest that it might be better adapted than other bird flu strains to infect mammals -- including humans -- and people have no resistance to it			2
because the virus does nâ€™t make birds sick , so it may spread widely and remain undetected until people become ill. a health worker sprays disinfectant at bird area of @entity157 health workers take a blood sample from a chicken in @entity69 yesterday			1
@entity69 is testing batches of chickens imported from mainland @entity3 the latest victim was one of three new infection cases diagnosed in @entity57 according to @entity3 news agency @entity165			1
the other two new cases - an 83 - year - old woman and a 68 - year - old man - are said to be in a stable condition in hospital			1
@entity3 authorities have been attempting to prevent the spread of the disease since it emerged in february			0
hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled at bird farms and poultry markets across @entity57 and the @entity91 province			0
sales of racing pigeons - a popular pastime in @entity3 - have also been banned			1
almost two million carrier pigeons have also been grounded			1
the outbreak of the @entity55 virus has already affected business in @entity3			1
just yesterday , the owner of the @entity3 arm of the fast food chain @entity187 reported that its profits had been hit by the virus			2
@entity192 scientists meanwhile have made a start on creating a vaccine for the new strain despite a sample from @entity3 only arriving yesterday			1
government - backed researchers begun testing a ' seed ' strain of the virus using a genetic code posted online			1
the new faster approach - born in the aftermath of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 - has seen weeks shaved off the vaccine making process			1
but it could still take five to six months before one is available			0
@entity210 , director of the @entity211 or @entity211 , said : ' we 'll take it , if the virus turns out to be a tough one , that head start could be very important			1
' the @entity69 government started enhanced measures to prevent a new strain of bird flu from entering the city officials from the @entity223 take chickens out from cages on a truck from mainland @entity3 at a border checkpoint in @entity69 as a test drive for the new flu technology , in 2011 the government gave its partners the genetic sequence for a @entity233 strain of @entity55 , a similar virus to the one making people sick in @entity3			1
in less than two weeks , scientists were ready to make virus seed			0
the next year , they sequenced an @entity239 virus and produced a synthetic virus in six days			0
then came a live test			0
the @entity192 asked its partners to make a real vaccine for a variant of swine flu known as @entity245 that had been infecting children in the @entity192 @entity247 last year			1
once again , they produced virus seed in less than a week			0
so , when @entity3 health authorities released the genetic sequence for the @entity55 bird flu on march 30 , @entity192 health officials decided to try the new technique			1
@entity256 and @entity257 's company , @entity255 , went to work and by april 4 , they had synthetic dna ready and had started to grow the virus in cells , long before samples of the actual virus arrived from @entity3 yesterday			2
@entity263 has called for @entity265 authorities to ban @entity267 pigeon racing because of the new strain of bird flu			2
a chicken is seen inside a cage on a truck from mainland @entity3 at a border checkpoint in @entity69 the animal rights group has been monitoring the outbreak in @entity3 and has warned that an epidemic could spread to @entity265			1
they are concerned pigeons released from @entity278 and @entity279 may have been exposed to diseases if they land on foreign farms , drank contaminated water or have come into contact with other infected birds			0
associate director @entity286 , of @entity263 , said : ' aside from risking the pigeons ' lives pigeon fanciers may be putting human health at risk by taking @entity265 pigeons across the @entity293			0
' ' we hope the government will take action now rather than wait and see if people get sick			0
' the release of pigeons from international locations is subject to compliance with import rules set out by the @entity303 ( @entity303 )			0
however , @entity263 claim a recent undercover investigation has revealed widespread non-compliance with these requirements			0
a spokesperson said : ' thousands of pigeons are crammed into filthy , congested cages and transported to and from continental @entity310 for up to seven days			0
' they are then released to return to @entity265 without the required checks and certification , in apparent violation of @entity265 law			0
' bird flu is caused by a flu virus that is closely related to human flu viruses			2
it is spread through bird droppings , water , feed and equipment			0
as of january 2012 the @entity73 has confirmed there have been 583 cases of @entity239 in humans leading to 344 deaths			0
these have occurred in @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity3 , @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 and @entity341 .			0

there are now 38 confirmed cases of the new strain in @entity3
who says there is no evidence of human - to - human transmission
@entity69 is testing batches of chickens imported from mainland @entity3
carrier pigeons have been grounded and sales of racing pigeons banned
@entity192 scientists have begun work on creating a vaccine for the strain
techniques learned in the swine flu outbreak have given them a head start
but it could still be five to six months before a vaccine is available
