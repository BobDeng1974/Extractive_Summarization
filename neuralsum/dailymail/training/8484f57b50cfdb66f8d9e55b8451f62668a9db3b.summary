many people travel thousands of miles and sit in the freezing cold of the @entity3 to see the @entity4			2
but residents of @entity6 and @entity7 were treated to the dazzling light show last night as the aurora borealis was spotted on the north eastern coast of the @entity11			2
one photographer managed to capture the breathtaking views by @entity14 , on the @entity16 coast and the display was described as the ' best in years			1
' photographer @entity18 from @entity19 , @entity20 , travelled to @entity14 , on the @entity16 coast to capture this image of @entity4			1
he said the thrilling show lasted for several hours , as light travelled across the ' dark and moonless night ' @entity18 from @entity19 , @entity20 , travelled to the castle with relative 16 - year - old @entity25 , who is studying for a gcse in photography			1
he said the thrilling show lasted for several hours , as pillars of light ' danced across the dark and moonless night '			2
there are two types of @entity32 - @entity4 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity35 , ‘ dawn of the south			0
’ they are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity42 ’s atmosphere			1
these so - called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the @entity42 ’s magnetic field			1
usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the @entity42 ’s magnetic field , but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			1
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are common			1
' we knew there was a 20 per cent chance of seeing the aurora but we went up to take pictures of the @entity64 ' , explained the 42 - year - old			2
' when it started it came out of the blue and instead of staying for three or four hours we were there for about seven			0
' there was a small show around 10pm , then it got stronger after midnight and at 2am it went crazy			0
' there were a lot of greens and some pink colours in the sky			2
there were swirling and dancing pillars of light going 100ft ( 30 metres ) in the air			2
' it was unreal and the best show i have seen for years			0
' that sentiment was shared by @entity86 , which tweeted ' we had the best aurora display in years '			0
there are two types of @entity32 - @entity4 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity35 ’ , known as ‘ dawn of the south			0
’ the natural phenomenon is caused by charged particles colliding in the @entity42 's atmosphere and is typically seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemisphere			1
nitrogen produces blue or purplish - red aurora			0
before a display , electrons and protons are hurled from the sun 's atmosphere and are blown towards the @entity42 by the solar wind			1
often these particles are then deflected by the @entity42 's magnetic field but as it is weaker at either pole , some particles enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			1

auroral displays appear in many colours although green ( picutred ) and pink are the most common auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			1
shades of red , blue , and violet have also been reported			0
the common , greenish - yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity42			1
rare , red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up , at around 200 miles ( 321km )			0
@entity150 , a 29 - year - old volunteer at @entity86 , said the solar wind takes three days to reach @entity42 , so aurora watchers have some notice about when the lights might appear strongly			2

@entity150 from @entity86 said the solar wind takes three days to reach @entity42 , so aurora watchers have some notice about when the lights might appear strongly experts said aurora watchers need to head out of the city and away from light pollution which bleaches out the display , as does bright moonlight			1
an image of the display was also taken over @entity169 in @entity7 ( pictured ) he said : ' it 's hit and miss and you have to hope everything else works in your favour			2
' you need clear skies , the @entity42 's magnetic field has to be pointing in the right direction ... it 's complicated but it is worth it when it comes off			1
' aurora watchers also need to head out of the city and away from light pollution which bleaches out the display , as does bright moonlight			2
mr @entity150 added : ' unless it is a very strong storm , it is quite difficult to see in the city as the lights will drown it out			0
' usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the @entity193 , such as @entity194 and @entity195			0
other photos of the @entity11 display were taken over @entity169 in @entity7			0
the @entity4 over @entity198 were also recently added to @entity199 so armchair explorers can see the display and explore the remote region online			0

the *spectacle* was captured by photographer @entity18 by @entity14 , on @entity16 coast
mr @entity18 , 42 , and from @entity19 , @entity20 , travelled to the castle with relative @entity25
the natural phenomenon is caused by charged particles colliding in the @entity42 's atmosphere
these collisions emit light and although displays appear in many colours , pale green and pink are the most common
it is typically seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemisphere but can travel further *inland*
