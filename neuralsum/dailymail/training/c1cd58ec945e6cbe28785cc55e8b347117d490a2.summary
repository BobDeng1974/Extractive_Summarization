by @entity0 @entity1 has given his clearest indication yet that he will sign a new deal at @entity4			1
the @entity5 has been at the helm since 1996 , but has repeatedly stalled on agreeing a new three - year contract at the club before his current agreement runs out at the end of the season			0
but , speaking ahead of saturday ’s @entity13 clash at home against @entity15 , @entity1 insisted any uncertainty over his future would not complicate @entity4 ’s negotiations in the january market			1
no news : @entity4 boss @entity1 says the club are not close to any transfers as the club announced a deal with @entity26 as the @entity27 , the @entity4 boss is seen here with @entity29 not a fan : @entity1 says he would love to scrap the transfer window he said : ‘ there is always a point where you have to decide , of course			1
there is a point where you have to decide and there is a point where you have to make your decision public			0
you can take that sentence the way you want it			0
’ however , the @entity4 boss admitted he needed to convince supporters his squad could compete again for the highest honours			1
the capture of £ 42million signing @entity48 last summer , he believes , was crucial in that process			0
‘ people were questioning whether i could deliver quality , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ my commitment has never been a problem			0
i am convinced i can			0
‘ this question is not about me , it ’s more about “ do people believe @entity4 can compete ? ” the fact we bought @entity48 in at top - level money has turned belief around			1
‘ i would have loved to ( sign a player like @entity48 earlier )			0
but i would have loved first to keep the players we had			0
we were not capable of doing that			0
’ all smiles : per @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 share a joke during training down to business : @entity68 has a serious face on as he competes for the ball with @entity74 eyes on the ball : @entity48 controls the ball during training while @entity77 runs during training @entity1 said he is ready to bring in ‘ another special player ’ , but that the club are not close to signing @entity82 ’s @entity81			1
there were suggestions this week that @entity81 , 20 , had been spotted at @entity4 ’s training ground , but @entity1 joked : ‘ that ’s like a non-identified flying object			1
’ the @entity4 boss is enjoying life at the top of the table and admitted this season has been much easier , psychologically , adding : ‘ when you are in our position today it is natural motivation and there is incitement to go further			1
’ meanwhile , @entity4 are also looking to secure new deals for defender @entity66 and full - back @entity103 , the @entity5 international who is out of contract in the summer			2
@entity1 said : ' we are making good progress and hopefully we can announce something soon			2
' my ball : @entity112 keeps the ball from @entity114 during training keep ball : @entity66 , @entity117 and @entity77 during training ' are we close to signing anybody ? at the moment i would say no. ' @entity1 added : ' the transfer market in january is a low key transfer market			1
' there is very reduced activity ( generally )			0
there will be some of course , but in the last three days as always			0
' @entity4 have also been linked with @entity15 forward @entity127			1
@entity1 said : ' do i rate @entity127 as player ? highly			1
have we made any approach to sign @entity127 ? no. ' i do n't think ( we would look to sign @entity127 ) because we have ( @entity133 ) @entity132 who is coming back , we have @entity134 who is making very good progress in training			1
' of course we have lost @entity137 and that for us was a big blow			0
hopefully we can compensate , but we have not made any approach ( for @entity127 )			2
' targets : @entity1 says @entity4 are not close to signing @entity81 are unlikely to move for @entity127 @entity1 would rather do away with the whole mid-season transfer window			1
' you have my signature straight away , ' he said			0
' either you scrap it completely , or you leave it open until as long as possible to the last four games			2
' it is like running a relay , then in the middle of the relay you change your runners			0
' @entity1 said : ' it gives teams a chance who are already convicted , it gives some teams hope			2
' but when i arrived in @entity161 , the window was open until april , the whole season , and it was not a problem			0
hang time : @entity4 's @entity66 ( rear right ) , @entity112 ( front left ) and @entity168 ( rear left ) pose during the @entity171 regular season game between @entity172 and @entity173 past and present : @entity68 and former @entity4 midfielder @entity174 watch the @entity172 against the @entity173 at the @entity175 ' why did you change it ? to create that high intense activity and suddenly in january everybody becomes nervous			1
' before it was the whole season and it did not create any problem			0
' @entity183 midfielder @entity182 could play in a protective mask against @entity15 following surgery to correct a broken nose suffered when he was caught by a stray elbow from @entity189 during the win at @entity191 on monday night , although full - back @entity192 is doubtful after twisting a ligament in his foot			2
@entity4 , meanwhile , have announced a new multi-million pound commercial tie - up with @entity26 , which will see the telecommunications specialist become the club 's official smartphone partner on a global basis until the end of the 2015/16 season .			2
