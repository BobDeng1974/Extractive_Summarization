with the latest in 21st - century technology — plus quite a bit from the 19th — it is unique			2
and despite having travelled by @entity5 , @entity6 , elephant and @entity8 canoe , the @entity4 has never been carried in anything quite like the transport which will take her to today ’s state opening of parliament			1
unveiled for the first time , the new @entity13 coach is only the second royal carriage to be built in a century and joins the unrivalled royal collection of coaches , phaetons , landaus , broughams and barouches			1
none of the others , however , features a 360 - degree ‘ coachcam ’ offering a monarch ’s - eye view of the procession , gold - plated hydraulics , motor - racing technology and a dazzling museum			0
open a diamond - clad door handle and , inside , we find a time capsule of 1,000 years of history			1
surmounted by a crown made from the timbers of @entity43 , which houses the royal website ’s ‘ coachcam ’ , the new state coach contains relics of all those key moments sacred to @entity48 and so much of the @entity49			1
the panelling includes slivers of @entity54 ’s @entity53 sled , sir @entity56 ’s apple tree , hut six at codebreaking centre @entity58 , one of sir @entity63 ’s @entity62 ladders and the beams of most of our great cathedrals			0
as she is drawn behind six horses , the @entity4 will be sitting on a piece of @entity72 ’s @entity71 , upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned , and surrounded by a bolt from a @entity74 , a musket ball from @entity76 , a bolt and rivets from the @entity79 and a button from @entity81			1
there ’s even a fragment of the bronze cannon from which every @entity85 is cast , and a piece of metal from the wreckage of a @entity89			0
chock full of history : as she is drawn behind six horses , the @entity4 will be sitting on a piece of @entity72 's @entity71 , upon which monarchs are traditionally crowned , and surrounded by a bolt from a @entity74 , a musket ball from @entity76 , a bolt and rivets from the @entity79 and a button from @entity81 little wonder this three - ton coach — 18ft long — has taken 50 people more than ten years to assemble			1
and it is all the idea of one remarkable @entity102			1
@entity103 , 64 , worked in the @entity104 as a young man before returning home to help organise the @entity4 ’s @entity108 exhibition in @entity102			1
having repaired carriages on the family farm in his youth , he set about building a replica of the @entity114			0
this led to something even more ambitious and , in 1986 , he built the @entity102 state coach , a gift from the people of @entity102 to the @entity4 to mark the country ’s bicentenary			1
it proved a very popular addition to the @entity104 , not least because it was the first state coach with heating			2
but mr @entity103 , whose family emigrated from @entity48 to @entity126 in the 1850s , was not finished			1
‘ i wanted to make something in honour of @entity4 ’s great reign and something which represents our extraordinary history , ’ he explains as he shows me his spotless creation in its new home behind the @entity131			1
so , he set about building something even larger than the @entity102 state coach at his workshop near @entity141			1
symbolism : a part of the @entity71 which is placed in a capsule beneath the seats in the new @entity13 state coach relics : woods from various celebrated buildings and vessels have been used to inlay the doors history : the panelling includes a button from @entity81 , wood from the @entity156 , a rivet from the @entity79 , slivers of @entity160 's @entity53 sled , wood from sir @entity56 's apple tree , @entity163 at codebreaking centre @entity58 , one of sir @entity63 's @entity62 ladders and the beams of most of our great cathedrals the construction was a labour of love			1
all the springs , for example , were hand - forged , while the wheels were cast in aircraft - strength aluminium and made by one of @entity102 ’s leading racing car designers			1
mr @entity103 wanted to use the finest craftsmen and women from all over the @entity49			2
so , all the leather is @entity182 , as is the gold silk @entity183 ( from @entity184 )			0
the lamps are glazed with the finest lead crystal from @entity187			0
the intricate heraldic paintwork has been hand - painted by @entity190 - born @entity102 @entity189			2
the door handles are from @entity192 — each is gold - plated and inlaid with 24 diamonds and 130 @entity102 sapphires by @entity198 master jeweller @entity197			2
even the bolts which fix the gold - plated hand supports to the bodywork have been finished using the same guilloche enamel as a @entity204 egg			0
and so it goes on			0
mr @entity103 has applied the same mind - boggling attention to detail to the historical artefacts which give the @entity13 coach its special status			1
he began by asking the custodians of @entity43 if he might have a piece of timber from @entity216 ’s flagship			0
once it was clear mr @entity103 had the endorsement of @entity131 , things started to progress			2
‘ i knew @entity43 had undergone a refit in 1922 and that they had set aside some timber , and they were kind enough to let me have some			0
’ the result is a crown resting on four lions modelled on those found on the gates of @entity131			0
the entire coach is covered with heraldic emblems , crests and motifs , all of which have been approved by the @entity233			2
comfy : flip up the armrests and there are discreet , @entity238 - style controls for the heating and electric windows underneath ' i wanted to make something in honour of @entity4 ' : @entity103 , 64 , designed and built the coach			1
the lamps , right , are glazed with lead crystal from @entity187 a wheel hub : mr @entity103 built the coach in his workshop near @entity141 , @entity102 using the work of the finest craftsmen and women from all over the @entity49 he then broadened his quest for other historic artefacts to include every great building and institution he could think of			1
the trust which looks after @entity258 donated some teak handrails from the old @entity6			0
they now form the armrests ( flip them up and there are discreet , @entity238 - style controls for the heating and electric windows underneath )			0
he secured contributions from @entity268 , @entity269 and even the old @entity270 at @entity271			0
@entity272 ’s and @entity273 presented certified pieces , as did @entity275 and many stately homes			0
the panelling includes yew from @entity279 in @entity72 , where the @entity280 grew up , ash from @entity282 and oak from @entity284 , ancestral home of the @entity287 family			0
going back somewhat further is a little bit of timber from the @entity291 boat found in the @entity292			0
a strong theme throughout is sacrifice			0
hence the metalwork from a @entity74 , @entity296 and @entity297 and many of our best - known battlefields			0
‘ i wanted something every family in the land can relate to , ’ he says			0
crowning glory : made from wood reclaimed from @entity43 the reproduction crown sits atop four lions modelled on those found on the gates of @entity131 mr @entity103 secured contributions from @entity268 , @entity269 and even the old @entity270 at @entity271			2
@entity272 's and @entity273 presented certified pieces , as did @entity275 and many stately homes			2
the public can go to view the new carriage at the @entity104 from tomorrow resplendent : the entire coach is covered with heraldic emblems , crests and motifs , all of which have been approved by the @entity233 dry run : the carriage rolls past the @entity323 in a rehearsal of the @entity325 , set to take place today there will be those who wonder why anyone should go to so much trouble — and how much it has all cost			1
besides , how do you put a price on all this ? mr @entity103 smiles and says he ’s not sure			2
he paid for a lot of it himself , but the coach has now been formally acquired for the nation by the @entity340 following a private donation			2
in other words , it has n’t cost the taxpayer a penny			0
after today , though , the public will be able to view it , along with all the other coaches and carriages , during the daily opening of the @entity104 at the back of @entity131			0
though the @entity4 has seen the finished product , she will not have ridden in it until today			1
mr @entity103 — who is already working on his next project , a tribute to horses that went to war — has been allocated a ringside view of the royal arrival at the @entity323			1
‘ it will be a very special moment , ’ he says			0
‘ she ’s a wonderful example to humanity , and this has been a great team effort			0
’ the @entity4 arrives for 2013 's state opening of parliament in the @entity366 , which had been her traditional carriage for the procession from @entity131 to the @entity323			1
this year she will use the new @entity13 coach in 2012 , the @entity370 of @entity371 saw the @entity4 and the @entity372 use the @entity102 state coach for the procession			1
it was then the newest in the @entity131 's collection , having been presented to mark @entity102 's bicentennial in 1988 .			1

the @entity4 's new @entity13 coach is only the second new royal carriage to be built in a century
it contains relics of key moments and *incidents* from more than a thousand years of @entity48 history
designed by @entity102 @entity103 , 64 , it is to be unveiled today when the @entity4 goes to @entity371
