by @entity0 published : 11:04 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 25 january 2013 @entity2 - filled streets are causing fresh misery for many @entity4 who have been left with overflowing bins after hundreds of rubbish collections were cancelled for ' safety ' reasons			1
as mountains of black bags pile up householders are angry the welfare of binmen comes before collecting household waste - despite some rubbish dating back to @entity16			1
waste strewn on pavements and spilling out of bins is a risk to public health because they are attracting vermin , critics have said			1
still waiting : a giant pile of black bags with food spilling out all over the floor lies against a tree in @entity29 , @entity30 , where collections were cancelled because it was unsafe for binmen anger : because of the snow and ice , rubbish lies uncollected around @entity30 , with some residents saying their waste dates back to @entity16 queue : bins , black bags and recycling baskets sit on streets amongst snow in @entity30 ( left ) and @entity46 , @entity47 ( right ) today as residents complain of household waste not being picked up @entity50 : a pile of rubbish - including a @entity53 tree - waits for collection in the @entity56 city as anger grows over the mountains of rubbish on some streets cancellations have also taken place in @entity30 , @entity63 and @entity64 , with refuse lorries also struggling with ice - covered side roads - and councils have wheeled out a ' health and safety ' excuse to explain why bin men can not coolect the overflowing rubbish			1
mother - of - one @entity73 , from @entity74 , said : ' it baffles me why binmen find it so difficult to complete their rounds when everyone else is getting their life back to normal			2
' but a message on @entity84 's website defended the cancellations			0
it said : ' even if the road has been gritted and is safe for vehicles , we also need to consider the safety of refuse collectors carrying heavy loads across slippery pathways and driveways as falls can be common			0
' the overflowing bin bags follow the furore at the start of january when council binmen made just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an @entity102 law			1
unsavoury : open bags and even a chair lie across the snowbound floor in @entity30 waiting to be collected still waiting : residents in @entity108 , @entity109 , are yet to have their rubbish collected as usual service have because of the snow grimy : this snowy scene in idyllic @entity109 is ruined by the piles of black bags and bins needing emptying residents in a block of flats in @entity121 , @entity122 , were told red tape means the binmen ca n't collect rubbish there when it 's too dark for them to see it			1
as a result , the massive pile of 70 stinking black binbags has built up and was overspilling into the bin store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile			2
but residents were stunned when the binmen told them that the @entity102 regulations mean they ca n't put their hands where they ca n't see them for health and safety reasons			1
a fresh layer of snow fell over @entity30 yesterday with more today and temperatures plunged to as low as @entity144 last night			0
there have been car accidents , slips and snow - ins , but the latest problem to come from the cold snap is overflowing rubbish bins			1
@entity152 with her bin that is overflowing with rubbish on the streets of @entity156 , because of the recent winter weather bin lorries have been unable to get around residential areas as the roads have not been gritted @entity156 is one of many areas across the country that is still waiting for their rubbish to be collected , with piles of it left in the streets residents have complained that the overflowing bins pose a serious health hazard , as the rubbish might attract rats the condition of the roads has made it impossible for bin wagons to collect waste from residential areas , leaving homeowners to dispose of rubbish themselves or cope with the contaminated consequences			1
in @entity156 , rubbish can be seen spilling from wheelie bins and bursting from rubbish bags			1
rubbish from full bins in the @entity187 area is strewn around snowy roads and streets			2
@entity190 , 50 , unemployed , who lives in the @entity191 in @entity187 , @entity156 , said : ' i 'm not very happy about it , it is awful			0
' especially if people come to visit , it just looks awful			0
' in the past there have been rats			0
they seem to empty them haphazardly at the best of times , leaving stuff lying about			0
' icy : large amounts of rubbish remains on this @entity47 street as residents complain it could cause a health hazard excuses : councils have been criticised as residents fear that they are putting binmen over their own safety residents around the country have complained about the lengthy time it has taken to collect their rubbish which has been strewn over the pavements in the plush area of @entity225 , @entity156 , the remnants of @entity223 's parties can be seen spilling from the bins			1
beer and fizzy pop appear to have been the tipples of choice with empty bottles pouring from rubbish bags			2
@entity152 , 21 , a @entity233 student of @entity234 living in @entity235 , @entity225 , said : ' it 's pretty bad around here			0
there 's obviously going to be rats and stuff			0
' there should be another way they can clear the bins			2
if people can sweep the snow off the road they can clear the rubbish			2
' one 33 - year - old doctor who works at @entity156 's @entity250 , but refused to be named , has a build up of rubbish outside his home in @entity254 , @entity156			0
he said : ' the council could have let us know that it could n't be collected			0
' we know it is difficult to go around everywhere but they could have put something on the radio or television to let us know when it is going to be collected			0
' they came last week , but they have n't been this week - they were due on wednesday			0
' the heaps of rubbish at the flats in @entity121 , @entity122 , which binmen refused to collect because of an @entity102 law			1
