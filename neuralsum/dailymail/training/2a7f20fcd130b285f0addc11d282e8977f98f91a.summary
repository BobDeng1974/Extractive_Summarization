a new class of millionaire football players just secured @entity3 contracts with the draft but the vast majority of them will not keep their fortunes secure for very long			1
the @entity3 is taking active steps to try to help curtail the staggering rate by which football players blow through their multi-million dollar contracts			1
contracts awarded to top players - like this year 's first round draft pick @entity14 who landed a $ 22million contract with the @entity17 - lead to spending excesses in a surprisingly high number of cases			1
number one : @entity14 was drafted by the @entity17 and is expected to make between $ 22million and $ 25million in his first four seasons in 2009 , @entity23 calculated that 78 per cent of all @entity3 players end up bankrupt or basically bankrupt within two years of their careers ending - if not sooner			1
' i 've made millions and iost millions ... i bought a ton of jewelry coming out , cars , a stereo system that was worth more than the car , ' former first round draft pick @entity29 said to @entity35			1
taking care of mom : @entity14 said that his first priority for his paycheck will be to make sure his single mother @entity40 , who works at a potato chip factory , is looked after @entity29 was the first round pick in 1996 and played for nine seasons before virtually running out of money			1
' i found out real quick that money and ignorance is not a good combination			2
' now the @entity3 has actively started addressing the issue and calls for rookie players to attend a three - day symposium where they are given some lessons in financial basics			1
' the best advice i got was to remain humble , ' former @entity58 player - turned - @entity56 scholar and medical school student @entity29 said			2
' there are veterans on the team who have six or seven cars they drive to practice and @entity66 and @entity68 suits			0
if you give into that lifestyle , you go broke quickly			0
' individual teams have their own guidance programs as well			0
last year 's @entity74 winners , the @entity75 , put ' @entity76 , the director of player development , up to the task and he told @entity78 that the best way is to talk it through with the athletes individually by teaching them how to budget			0
' a lot of these guys do n't have any concept of money			0
i always ask the question : how many of you guys ever made over $ 10,000 a year in your life ? ' @entity76 said			2
no one normally raises their hand			0
he then goes on to explain credit scores and the importance of calculating for taxes when looking at their paychecks			0
the biggest paycheck from this season is undoubtedly going to @entity14 , who some estimated will make up to $ 25million in his first four seasons			1
' this feels great , i 've been waiting all my life for this , ' he said following friday night 's draft			2
words of wisdom : former @entity58 player - turned - @entity56 scholar and medical school student @entity29 ( left ) urges rookies to remain humble while @entity75 director of player development ' @entity76 ( right ) goes through lessons on budgeting and credit scores with his new players every season ' i grew up the hard way			1
a lot of people said i 'd be nothing			0
' but i always said i 'd be something one day and here i am			0
' it was a life - changing moment for @entity14 , who was raised by a single mother who has spent the last 20 years working in a potato chip factory just to make ends meet			2
' the first thing i 'm going to do is take care of my mom , ' he said .			0

@entity3 now trying to address the issue by having rookies go through budgeting *seminars* before launching into their first season
