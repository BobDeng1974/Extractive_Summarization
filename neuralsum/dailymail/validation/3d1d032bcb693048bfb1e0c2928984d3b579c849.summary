the 44 - year - old , who replaced @entity38 last year , admitted to finding ways to avoid helping out around the house			2
despite her husband @entity41 running the @entity13 , she told @entity43 's @entity42 that all she does is irons his shirts			1
' i 've developed this thing that if i iron @entity16 's shirts on a sunday night then that kind of gets me off the hook of any other domestic tasks because in my head that 's me i 've pulled my weight in the house , of the domestic chores			1
' the interview was carried out at the couple 's home in @entity59 just outside @entity9			1
@entity42 's @entity10 told ms @entity0 that he immaculate house looked like a ' show home ' ms @entity0 invited the cameras into her home near @entity9 as part of a series ahead of polling day on may 7 the cameras showed ms @entity0 opening the door to @entity70 , making coffee and sitting in a conservatory to answer questions			1
@entity70 told her : ' we are in your lovely home now			0
it 's like a show home			2
' ms @entity0 replied : ' that 's because i had my husband up most of last night cleaning it			1
it 's not always this tidy			0
' in one recent interview @entity86 was seen preparing dinner , but the best ms @entity0 could do was make a coffee			0
' i 've never been very good in the kitchen , ' she admitted			2
@entity0 married @entity41 , the @entity13 's chief executive , in 2010 ' i like @entity93 takeaway , ' she said , before joking : ' the fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a friday night should n't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle			1
' @entity70 also asked her about whether she had made a decision not to have children			1
ms @entity0 said : ' people have started asking me , ' was it a conscious decision ? ' it has n't been , it 's just you know life takes certain directions and it does n't take other directions and that 's about as complicated as it gets			2
' the former solicitor married mr @entity41 in 2010			1
together with @entity38 and spin doctor @entity115 , they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the @entity119			0

ms @entity0 admitted that during her time in politics she had gained a reputation for being ' scary ' with a tough persona			0
she said : ' politics is a very male dominated , male driven profession			0
i was , not just a woman , but a young woman and i suppose you end up trying to behave in a way that you think is expected of you			0
' ' i am quite driven , i know what i think and i know what i want to achieve but i also hope that people who are asked to describe me , would describe me as pretty down - to - earth , loyal , friendly			0
the more experience i have got in politics i think the more i have allowed me to shine through			0
' she refused to speculate how many seats the @entity13 will win on may 7 , but suggested her party would perform better in a coalition than the @entity150			2
' i 'm not going to put a number on it , opinion polls do n't win elections , hard work , persuasion , having the best policies and the best ideas for the country wins elections , so we 'll try and win as many votes as we can and hope that translates into as many seats as possible			0
' the @entity165 in my view have got themselves into the position they are in just now which is facing political annihilation in a few weeks time , not because they went into coalition but because they went into coalition and immediately abandoned all of their principals			0
