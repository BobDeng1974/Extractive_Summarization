@entity2 's @entity1 team dazzled in red at the official dinner in @entity5 on monday night			1
captain @entity6 led her team of @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 at the tournament launch at the @entity14 hotel in @entity15			1
@entity16 ) @entity8 , @entity9 , captain @entity6 , @entity10 and @entity11 @entity2 team attended the official dinner at the @entity14 hotel in @entity15 , @entity5 the gb team face @entity20 , @entity21 and quite a strong @entity23 team in a bid to try to reach the higher levels of the @entity1			1
the task will be all the harder because @entity27 is absent with wrist trouble and while she is hoping to return to the tour to play smaller events next month that is still not certain			1
@entity32 said : ‘ she ’s obviously not played for a year and i do n’t think we should expect too much			2
i think we just need to give her time to play herself back in			2
she ’s obviously chomping at the bit to get back but she realises more than anybody that you just have to be patient and follow the orders of the doctor and the physios			2
the thing with a wrist injury is that you can still work very hard on your physical conditioning while you ’re not necessarily able to play as much			2
' the gb team are game for a laugh as they take a selfie before the @entity1 official dinner the ladies in red are all smiles for a selfie team photo on monday night tv pundit and former @entity56 no 1 @entity54 ( far right ) joined the the team at the dinner while @entity2 is going through an embarrassingly fallow period in junior tennis @entity32 has at least been heartened by the performance in @entity62 of @entity63 , a 15 - year - old from @entity65 who was overnight playing in the semi-finals of the junior event			1
‘ she ’s a good athlete , got a very good mind			0
she ’s got a very good foundation to her game already , strong serve , strong forehand			0
but i think it ’s her calmness and her ability to stick to a task that impresses me			0
‘ i sat on the chair with her during the @entity80 ( under 18 ) trophy last year when we played against the @entity83 at @entity84			0
she beat the no 1 and 2 for the @entity83 and came from a set down in both of them			0
she was able to process the tactics and information and stick with them against girls who were a couple of years older than her and very much more experienced			0
that was when i realised , we ’ve got a player on our hands here			0
