unveiled with great and solemn self - importance , after a teaser shot of a pair of scissors and a comb on @entity5 , here is the essential haircut for 2015			0
@entity8 — pop starlet turned x factor judge — yesterday revealed she has had her image - defining mane of long extensions snipped off			1
‘ long overdue ! ’ she sighed on @entity13			0
we imagine people will be frantically calling up salons and asking for a new hairdo on a scale not seen since the @entity31 phenomenon that was ' the @entity32 ' ... but we would n't be surprised if the singer and x factor judge took such drastic action just so she could show off the back of this dress in all its glory ! she was filming for the @entity40 show and even though her stylist @entity41 only gave us a sneak peak of the back of the dress , they do n't call us @entity45 for nothing you know ! a bit of investigative work revealed that this dress is by @entity20 and we love the woven texture , high neck and button detailing			2
the front is super chic , but of course thanks to that cut out it 's even better from the back ! and the best news is that this dress is now hugely reduced at @entity22 , so click ( right ) to get your hands on it			0
or if you want to bring sophisticated back a la @entity8 , check out our edit below for some white hot high street styles			0
this @entity66 dress at @entity67 will do the trick , or turn to one of @entity8 's favourite designer labels , @entity69			2
@entity71 cut out back dress at @entity67 visit site @entity74 cut out back dress at @entity67 visit site @entity76 cross back skater dress visit site @entity69 pleated cotton - piqué mini dress at the @entity22 visit site what remains , after the attentions of her regular hair stylist @entity83 , is a neat , layered bob , with some backcombing around the crown and shorter layers cut into the nape of the neck			2
considering that she is the face of beauty giant @entity93 , who pay her around £ 250,000 a year to promote their hair products , the restyle is a bold move			0
and you can bet that the new look will have an influence on the @entity101 , as @entity8 , now 31 , is idolised by thousands			0
they may not buy her albums ( her last release only managed to reach no. 7 in the charts before dropping back down ) , but they do buy her image			0
however , if imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery , then @entity8 must have a serious crush herself — on one @entity18			1
my fair ladies : @entity8 ( left ) and her lighter locks , in july 2011 , mirror a golden @entity18 in her @entity115 reunion days in december 2007 @entity116 issue : a slick parting heralds a serious look for @entity8 in may 2011 ( left ) , but a pouting @entity18 had already got there in february 2009 centre stage : both girls went for the centre parting , dark bob early in their careers - @entity8 ( left ) in 2002 , following @entity18 in 1997 pin - ups : @entity8 ( left ) unveils her messy up - do at a film premiere last year , while @entity18 tried her version in september 2013 wag alert : with extensions and a big blow - dry , it 's @entity8 ( left ) in 2006 , taking her lead from @entity18 two years earlier for , it turns out , that where the former @entity115 leads in the hairstyle stakes , so former @entity136 singer @entity8 follows			1
whether it is a bob , a side - plait or a bun , it seems that @entity8 likes to borrow , or revisit , looks from her style mentor			1
of course @entity18 , now 40 , did it all first — from a career in a world - beating all - girl band to marriage to an @entity148 footballer			1
the two women were even friends once , particularly during the 2006 @entity151 football finals in @entity152 , when @entity8 travelled to watch her then fiance @entity154 and @entity18 was there , too , with @entity156			2
however , relations between the two women became frosty after @entity154 was accused of cheating in 2008 , just two years after their wedding , and @entity18 did n’t even call			0
@entity8 said she ’d expected rather more from her fellow @entity160			0
in an interview in 2009 , @entity8 said that @entity18 ’s clothes were for ‘ older women ’ , and @entity18 retaliated by saying that @entity8 ’s range of shoes for fashion website @entity166 were ‘ just a pr stunt ’			2
twisted sisters : @entity8 steps out with a loose side - plait last summer - a style tried successfully by @entity18 ( right ) in april 2012 who 's that curl ? a cascading mane for both ladies - @entity8 ( left ) in 2012 and @entity18 sporting the look a full decade earlier fun with a bun : @entity8 at the 2012 @entity179 ball and @entity18 ( right ) at the @entity180 in 2009 my little pony : @entity8 ( left ) pictured in july 2006 , has a blonde ponytail - just like @entity18 in 2004 cap that ! @entity8 dons a leather cap in 2002 ( left ) - a year after @entity18 launched her solo career with the same look sources in both camps indicate that they have long since made up — certainly @entity8 wore a @entity18 dress in may 2012 to the premiere of the film @entity192 , and it was reported that the former @entity115 had invited @entity8 over for dinner later that year so they could properly let bygones be bygones			1
so what does @entity8 ’s new hair mean ? it seems to be a part of a complete make - under , embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to @entity203 restaurateur @entity202 in july last year , which has taken her from tanned , blonde @entity160 to sophisticated fashionista — a path trodden by @entity18 herself			1
@entity8 has hired a new make - up artist and new stylist in order to embrace a more subtle , more high - fashion look			1
her new image was played to great effect during her much - heralded return as a judge on @entity215 last year , and sources close to the show indicate she will be asked to come back again this year — with a £ 1.5 million fee dangled as an incentive			1
but will she do so , though , with a baby on board ? some fans firmly believe @entity8 is now pregnant , hence the less high - maintenance hair cut , and her relative lack of postings on @entity13 and @entity5 in recent weeks			1
if that ’s true , she can look forward to a whole new range of copycat cuts — after all , there are four @entity18 pregnancies to turn to			0

@entity8 , 31 , revealed she has cut off her mane of long hair extensions
@entity136 singer appears to follow the hairstyle lead of @entity18
@entity8 likes to borrow or revisit looks from the 40 - year - old ex @entity115
