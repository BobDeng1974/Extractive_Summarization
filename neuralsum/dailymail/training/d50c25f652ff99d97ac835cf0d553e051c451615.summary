have you ever wondered the amount of organisation that goes into safely guiding aircraft across our skies ? following up on our last video which focused on @entity7 , we now take our attention to the @entity9 , which is often referred to as ‘ the gateway to @entity7 ’			1
every day , between two and three thousand aircraft fly between @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity7			1
and this stunning video , created by @entity15 ( the @entity15 ) , shows every single airplane that went through the five major air spaces over the @entity9 during a 24 hour period in august last year , but condensed to two minutes			1
the video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours - highlighting the complexity of the routes and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other			2
at its busiest traffic can peak at 1,500 flights a day in the summer			0
@entity15 , from its control centre in @entity44 , is responsible for providing the air traffic control service to the @entity46 , which is the busiest of all @entity49 regions			1
around 80 % of all @entity50 passes through it , demonstrating the strategic importance of @entity53 and @entity55 airspace			0
@entity56 , @entity15 spokesman said : “ airspace is an incredibly valuable asset – just as important as the rail , road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday			0
‘ however , most people are n’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies			0
‘ that ’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work , the skill of our air traffic controllers and the @entity55 ’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to @entity7 and @entity77			1
’ data visualisation experts 422 @entity33 combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all @entity55 flights on one of the busiest days of last year , and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of @entity7 – reaching out into the @entity9			1
computer artists used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude , latitude and height data into luminous dots , which were accurately positioned over satellite images of @entity55 and mainland @entity7 , by day and by night			2
scheduling nightmare ! : new video shows the extent of travel across the @entity9 in 24 hours @entity77 hot - spots : the clusters of lights determine where most flights go in and out of @entity7 maze of air traffic : video shows the extent of precision planning that is needed every day to ensure the safety of airplanes @entity56 continued : ' @entity7 airspace is some of the busiest and most complex anywhere in the world			1
every day thousands of air traffic controllers guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations			2
' yet to most people , the choreography going on above them is entirely unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads			0
some might say that is how it should be			0
' but , that ignores one very important point			0
getting it right matters and we all have a stake in it			0

the stunning visualisation was created by the @entity55 air traffic controller @entity15 ( formerly known as @entity15 )
every day , between two and three thousand aircraft fly between @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity7
