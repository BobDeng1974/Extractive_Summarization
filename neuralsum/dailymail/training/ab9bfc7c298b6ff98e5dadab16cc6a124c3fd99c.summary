but that dream was shattered because unbeknown to him a faulty zip on his bag meant that for miles , his hard earned cash was streaming out behind him			2
and for fisherman @entity1 , the cash truly was the result of hard work , sweat and sacrifices			1
good intentions : @entity1 planned to buy his girlfriend @entity22 an engagement ring with his recent paycheck from a good season as a scallop fisherman after days and even weeks away at sea , aboard the scallop boat the @entity29 @entity28 , at last the boat had had a big haul			1
it was a welcome relief in a job which at times brings in nothing at all			0
when the ship docked on sept. 9 in @entity37 , @entity38 , mr @entity1 , 32 , immediately cashed his check , stuffed the bills into his backpack and headed south on the @entity42 at 8am			1

mr @entity1 only realised all his hard - earned cash was gone after travelling south on his motorbike along the @entity42 to @entity64 mr @entity1 turned his motorbike around and retraced his tracks searching desperately for his money			1
some luck , fortunately , was on his side , as a team of highway workers on a roadside project had scooped up $ 4,000 and handed it in to police			2
but the rest was gone , presumed taken by opportunist motorists			0
mr @entity1 , a father - of - four , had received a phone call from a person claiming to a driver in a silver @entity81 pickup , and claiming they had the cash , miss @entity22 told @entity44			1
but the couple were n't sure if it was a cruel prank			2
no money was handed in to the police			0

his dream was shattered when the $ 12,000 cash for his scallops , which he stuffed into his backpack , fluttered away in the wind because of a faulty bag zip as mr @entity1 prepared to set off on another long fishing trip , his sister @entity99 spoke to the news service , and told them he was angry and embarrassed at what had happened			1
she stressed he was a hard - working , honest , family man who has to leave his loved ones for days on end for a dangerous job to make ends meet			0
