@entity0 does not have to be on the scoresheet to have a match - winning influence			1
granted , there are not many games these days in which the @entity6 fails to find the net , as an impressive tally of 17 goals already this season proves			1
but on those rare occasions when @entity0 does n't score , you appreciate his all - round contribution to @entity16 's cause even more			1
@entity0 led the @entity17 superbly in their 3 - 0 win at @entity19 despite not scoring @entity0 takes on @entity20 ( left ) , @entity21 ( middle ) and @entity23 during the match @entity0 was a constant menace for the @entity19 back line all afternoon and influential in @entity16 's victory @entity0 scored a hat - trick in @entity16 's midweek win over @entity29 , taking his season 's tally to 17 goals sunday 's emphatic 3 - 0 victory at @entity19 was a case in point			1
@entity0 led the line magnificently , turning in one of his best performances of the season			1
he did n't score but still defined the outcome of the game , like @entity41 used to for @entity42			2
plotting his 42 touches of the ball on a map of the pitch , as @entity47 did in their analysis on sunday night , showed how @entity0 caused problems for the whole @entity19 back line			1
he was here , there and everywhere			0
left side , right side , through the middle			0
the striker spent the afternoon as a busybody , twisting and turning past challenges , drifting into space , orchestrating the attack , carving out chances			0
he set - up @entity16 's first goal for @entity62 and their third for @entity64			2
he also should have won a penalty when brought down by @entity21 , only to be shown a yellow card for simulation in a senseless decision by referee @entity69			2
@entity47 's @entity0 touch map showed how he caused problems for the entire @entity19 back line @entity0 's heat map from the @entity19 match shows how he led the city line right across the pitch @entity0 should have been awarded a penalty when @entity21 fouled him inside the box @entity79 is no cheat - @entity80 but referee @entity69 decided @entity0 had dived and brandished a yellow card @entity0 celebrates with @entity62 after the setting up the midfielder to score @entity16 's opening goal @entity0 laid the ball back perfectly to @entity62 , who smashed the ball in from outside the box had @entity0 not missed a straightforward chance at the far post in the 64th minute it would have been the perfect performance to mark his 100th @entity93 game			1
his all - round contribution underlined - as if we needed further proof - that his priceless importance goes far beyond goals			0
@entity0 's work - rate could n't be faulted - he ran 9.7km during the match and recovered possession on three occasions through his relentless pursuit of @entity19 's defenders			1
his sensational hat - trick against @entity29 last week looks like a turning point in @entity16 's season			2
prior to that match , they had won just twice in seven matches in all competitions			0
suddenly , they look a more unified and effective force			0
@entity16 may have given @entity114 a head - start in the @entity93 title race but they 're not about to give up the chase			2
city find themselves six points behind @entity114 at the top of the @entity93 table @entity0 is thwarted by @entity19 goalkeeper @entity122 as he tries to cap his performance with a goal @entity0 also delivered the ball for @entity64 to score @entity16 's third goal late on @entity0 will have the same influence on @entity16 's title challenge as @entity41 did for @entity42 last season @entity0 will have the singular impact on @entity16 's challenge for silverware this season as @entity41 had for @entity42 last			1
@entity41 scored 31 @entity93 goals as @entity42 finished a fraction short of the title			0
but his all - round contribution in setting up goals for others and his general commitment and work ethic were also exceptional			0
@entity0 is exactly the same - a talismanic figure who will also top 30 goals - it 's just he does all this without bringing any embarrassment on his club			1
@entity41 will always be tainted by his biting and racism controversies however many goals he scores			0
he 's @entity41 minus the madness and his all - round contribution needs to be appreciated .			0

@entity16 *produced* an impressive performance to beat @entity19 3 - 0
@entity0 set up two goals and tormented the @entity19 back line
he should have been awarded a penalty when fouled by @entity21
@entity0 has 17 goals already this season
he is having the same talismanic influence as @entity41 last season
but *unlike* the @entity167 man , @entity0 does n't bring any embarrassment
