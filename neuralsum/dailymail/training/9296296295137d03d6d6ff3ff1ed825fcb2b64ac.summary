@entity3 , who at 34 is one of the youngest heads in the country , took no action when staff told him they were worried that the four - year - old had been beaten by his mother			1
but he quietly left the primary school soon after the four - year - old was murdered and has now taken up a new headship			1
yesterday , pressure on the professionals involved in the case intensified after it was revealed that not one person has been disciplined			0
deputy pm @entity25 questioned how authorities had missed warning signs and said he thought @entity6 ’s death ‘ should be on all of our consciences ’			1
the little boy resembled a ‘ concentration camp victim ’ following the cruelty inflicted on him by @entity6 , 27 , and stepfather @entity6 , 34			2
staff at @entity36 primary school , @entity35 , noticed @entity6 was stealing food , attempting to eat playdough and scavenging in playground bins			1
at one point , he was so ravenous he ate a pancake covered in mud and grit left after a @entity45 tuesday race			0
by the time he died , his emaciated body weighed less than a toddler and he was six inches shorter than average			0
teachers claimed they were hoodwinked by his ‘ evil ’ mother who told them he had an eating disorder			0
but it was clear there was some distrust of @entity6			2
in january , @entity6 ’s class teacher @entity55 wrote in a school concerns book that he had bruises around his neck which she feared @entity6 had caused while trying to ‘ strangle him ’			1
@entity60 , in @entity35 , where @entity6 used to attend @entity6 ( circled in green ) is seen leaving @entity60 in @entity35 with his mother ( circled in yellow ) just 36 hours before he died staff at @entity36 primary school noticed @entity6 was stealing food , attempting to eat playdough and scavenging in playground bins the following month , she alerted mr @entity3 when @entity6 had black eyes			1
but , in court , mr @entity3 claimed it was not serious enough to go in the concerns book			2
it is believed that child protection officials were not made aware of @entity6 ’s desperate attempts to steal food , his rapid weight loss or his injuries			2
parents told the @entity77 that at least three members of staff , including the headteacher , had left as a result of the tragedy			2
one parent , whose child was in the same class as @entity6 said : ‘ the headteacher felt incredibly guilty that the school did n’t spot anything			2
i ’d seen @entity6 myself in class and he seemed perfectly happy			0
i certainly did n’t see any cause for concern			0
‘ the head left at the end of term after @entity6 died			1
he sent a letter to all the parents that he was leaving due to the circumstances			0
deputy pm @entity25 ( left ) questioned how authorities had missed warning signs and said he thought the death of @entity6 ( right ) ' should be on all of our consciences ' ‘ @entity6 ’s class teacher left soon after he died too , i do n’t think she wanted to carry on working in the same school where she would be reminded of what happened			1
’ yesterday , mr @entity3 was enjoying the sunshine at his home in @entity111 , @entity112			0
he refused to comment on the case , but added : ‘ an awful lot has been said			0
it ’s not been a pleasant time for anyone concerned , in all honesty			0
’ mr @entity3 went straight from his old job to being appointed head of nearby @entity122 primary school			1
mr @entity25 said : ‘ clearly people must have seen something was wrong with this boy			0
i think his death should be on all of our consciences			0
we all ask the same questions : how did this happen ? what happened when teachers saw this boy scavenging in bins , when they saw him lose all that weight ? ‘ they apparently did pass information on – why did no - one act on it ? when he went to hospital and the mum and stepfather spun a web of lies , what happened to the concerns people had ? ’ a @entity148 spokesman said mr @entity3 had left of his own volition and not as a result of @entity6 ’s death .			1
