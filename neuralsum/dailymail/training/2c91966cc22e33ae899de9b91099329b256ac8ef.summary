by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 26 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:07 est , 26 february 2014 becoming a little turned around after a pub crawl could now be a thing of the past for barflies in @entity7 , as a dedicated drinker has designed a @entity10 - style map that charts bars , restaurants and pubs all over the city			1
the ' @entity15 ' was created by @entity16 , and features a massive 563 locations across the northern city , replacing tube stations with drinking , eating , and lodging establishments			1
mr @entity16 , 39 , spent over a year of his spare time designing the drinker 's guide , using both virtual and physical mapping methods to complete the project			1
the ' @entity29 ' map , drawing from the iconic @entity10 design , the map details the locations of 563 pubs and bars in @entity7 @entity16 , a former graphic design student , took over a year to create the map , walking dozens of miles in his efforts the former @entity38 graphic design student clocked up dozens of miles walking the city , and taking virtual street tours			1
most of his mapping efforts were to make sure that the pubs he was listing on his map were still open and operational , as many might have been closed or renamed			1
mr @entity16 said : ' having always admired the design of the @entity44 and going out in @entity7 , i decided to do this project to combine the two			1
the map could easily be used to chart the routes of a pub crawl , or just more easily locate a pub in the city that you 've always wanted to try @entity16 plans to sell the maps on his website for £ 10 each ' it 's been over a year in development on and off in my spare time			1
' it 's been deceptively long and hard work , but i 'm very happy with the finished result			2
' i 've had lots of kind comments about it already and it does make me feel quite proud			0
' friends and neighbours have said that they are really impressed with it and when i had my photograph taken complete strangers came up to me and said they really wanted one			0
' because the project took over a year to complete , mr @entity16 found that many of the sites he had listed at the start had become obsolete , and so his map required constant updating			1
@entity16 both walked dozens of miles , and used virtual mapping techniques to make make sure that every pub , restaurant and bar was actually open and operational , and that they had n't changed their name , so that his map was completely correct he said : ' since starting the project i 've had to remove a lot of pubs that have closed down and even been demolished and that 's always sad			1
' about a quarter - of - a - mile from my house there was a pub that had been demolished before it had been printed			0
' it is quite sad to see so many close and come off the map in the 12 months i have created it			2
' but it is also nice to see that some new places are also opening up , but mostly in the city centre			2
' when i was putting it together there were lots of places that i would n't know about and places that i never even knew existed			0
' i ca n't say i 've been to all of the places on the map and probably never will , but i 've been to lots of places i did n't know about before as a result of researching and designing this			2
' @entity16 's maps cost £ 10 and are available from www.albanydesign.co.uk			1
rugby player @entity109 after being released from hospital after his accident being hit by a bus on a @entity7 pub crawl a pub crawl , the act of going from one bar to another , drinking more and more drinks on a per - determined route , is a popular @entity119 pastime			0
but the hobby can be dangerous			0
groups of people drinking strong drinks , with the peer pressure culture of ' downing ' drinks meaning that people are stumbling out of bars and into streets to head to the next place , where they are at risk of being hit by cars			2
this danger was shown in @entity7 last year when the former boyfriend of @entity134 , @entity135 ace @entity109 , drunkenly tumbled into the road while on a pub crawl , and was hit by a bus			0
@entity109 was treated in @entity7 @entity139 , and was pictured days later hobbling out on crutches with various cuts and bruises from his accident			0
according to eyewitnesses , him and friends had been taking on the @entity7 ' @entity147 pub crawl ' , featuring 14 different drinking locations			0
one landlord said @entity109 and friends had been ' necking ' drinks , with one landlord noting that they had spent £ 200 in 15 minutes on beer and shots			0
later , he collided with the bus , and with an eyewitness commenting : ' every bit of the bus front window was smashed to pieces , imagine what the guy looks like			0

lists over 500 bars , restaurants , pubs and *hostels* across the northern city
creator @entity16 used his *skills* as a former graphic design student
he clocked up dozens of miles walking around the city during the mapping
