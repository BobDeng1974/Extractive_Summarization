@entity0 is poised to become @entity2 's first signing at @entity3 for the sum of £ 28.4million			1
the @entity6 midfielder was on the @entity9 club 's radar last summer , but new manager @entity10 has breathed new life into the deal			1
here , @entity14 's @entity13 explains exactly what @entity3 can expect to get for their money			1
he did it last season at @entity47 and they will be confident he can do it again			0
so he is a leader ? he has the character that a club looking to rebuild will need			0
he ’s honest , fiercely committed and loyal			0
there was evidence of that last season when @entity3 moved too late in the transfer window to get him and the only way the deal was going to happen is if he forced his way out of @entity47			1
@entity59 gambled on @entity47 lowering their buy - out clause – something that he should have known they never do – and only if @entity0 had put in a transfer request and started a war was the deal going to go through			1
out of respect to @entity47 he would n’t do it			0
he wanted to go to @entity3 but he wanted the transfer to be done properly			1
and when it did n’t happen he did n’t sulk he got down to the business of helping @entity47 qualify for the @entity44			0
that ’s the kind of man he is			0
tackle : @entity0 ( right ) puts a foot in on @entity75 's @entity74 in a @entity77 clash winner : @entity0 beats @entity74 to a header during the @entity77 match at the illustrious @entity81 1			1
£ 37.1mi - @entity82 from @entity83 in january 2014 2			2
£ 30.75m - @entity84 from @entity85 in september 2008 3			2
£ 29.3m - @entity86 from @entity87 in july 2002 4			2
£ 28.1m - @entity88 from @entity89 in july 2001 5			2
£ 27.5m - @entity90 from @entity91 in september 2013 and he was successful ? he was and it was n’t is n’t easy			2
because of the rise of @entity95 there was only one place up for grabs and @entity47 beat @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 to the punch largely thanks to @entity0 ’s leadership and his five goals and five assists from midfield			1
where did he play ? he usually operated in a midfield three slightly ahead of two holding players but @entity3 fans need not be concerned that they have bought another number 10 because he can comfortably operate slightly deeper , building the play			1
he has the vision and the passing for the role and he ’s also tough			0
can he help make @entity115 a fortress again ? @entity47 went until mid-february last season without losing at home			0
@entity75 turned up in november on a roll and were rolled out of town empty handed			0
both @entity121 and @entity122 were taken off and @entity0 was one of the best players on the pitch			1
@entity125 also failed to win there			2
performer : @entity75 played @entity6 in november and left empty handed , with @entity0 a star player how will he fit in ? there is a @entity82 connection that @entity3 fans should be excited about			1
the two played together when @entity21 won the @entity132 21 euros in @entity133 in 2011			0
@entity0 scored the all - important first goal with a header and helped mesmerize the @entity137 opposition in the @entity138 linking brilliantly with @entity139 and with @entity82			1
why has n’t he stepped up ? he has had to wait for the changing of the guard			0
with @entity122 and @entity142 on their way out the path opens up for @entity0			1
@entity146 spoke after the win over @entity148 about the future being bright – @entity0 , along with @entity150 ’s @entity139 and @entity95 ’s @entity151 , is one of the reasons why			1
but @entity151 went to the @entity153 and @entity139 would have gone had he not got injured so are @entity3 getting the 3rd best option ? there is no shame being left out of @entity21 ’s squad of midfielders			1
@entity125 spent 30m euros on @entity159 last summer and he ’s nowhere near the squad			0
@entity0 will be far better value than @entity159			2
he can defend , the can attack , he keeps the ball , and he wins it back when it ’s been lost			0
foes to friends : @entity3 's @entity166 battles with @entity0 for the ball at @entity115 in 2012 he ’s a slow burner , but that often beats an overnight sensation			1
he ’s had to work hard to get recognition at unfashionable @entity23			0
@entity47 wanted him as a kid but he stayed loyal to @entity23			0
eventually they got him , for 8m back in 2011			0
then it was their turn to fight to hold on to him			0
now they have lost that battle and he ’s a @entity3 player			2
@entity10 will approve ? you do n’t think @entity3 dare sign him without @entity10 ’s approval ? the @entity178 had a reputation at @entity150 for being offered players by directors @entity182 and @entity183 and telling them ‘ no ’ , ‘ no ’ , ‘ no ’			2
he will have said yes to @entity184 and he will have said yes for a reason – he ’s a midfield soldier , with the flair to find the passes that will release @entity82 , @entity189 and @entity190 and with the stomach for a @entity9 battle			0
approved : new boss @entity2 will have said yes to @entity0 coming if the deal goes through @entity194 : @entity0 can pick out @entity82 , @entity189 and @entity195 with clever passes @entity197 set for @entity199 shopping spree			1
