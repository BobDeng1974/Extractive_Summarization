@entity0 has rejected an appeal by @entity2 and the @entity3 against his four - month ban from all football activities for biting an opponent			1
the appeal was lodged against the sanctions imposed on the @entity11 striker by @entity0 's disciplinary committee for biting @entity14 's @entity13			1
they included a nine - match international ban plus a 100,000 @entity17 franc ( Â£ 66,000 ) fine			0
' the terms of the decision taken by the @entity0 appeal committee were communicated to the player and the @entity21 @entity38 today ( thursday )			0
' both the player and the @entity4 can make a further appeal to the @entity47			0
@entity31 added : ' the relevant decision is not yet final and binding , i.e. an appeal to the @entity50 is still possible by the player and / or the @entity21 @entity38 , subject to certain conditions			0
' the disciplinary committee 's initial decision took into account there had been no remorse from @entity2 , and the fact it was the third time he had been involved in biting an opponent			2
after lodging his appeal , @entity2 did then issue a formal apology to @entity13 and vowed never to bite anyone again			1
the player was sent home from the @entity20 in disgrace and faces being out of club football until the end of october , during which time he will not be allowed to train with a club			2
@entity0 has confirmed that the ban will not stand in the way of any transfer to @entity73 , who are close to agreeing a deal with @entity11 , nor of @entity2 having a medical at a prospective new club .			1

@entity3 striker was banned following bite on @entity14 defender during @entity20 group stage
he has since been linked with a move to @entity73 from @entity11
should the transfer go through then @entity2 would miss the first two months of the @entity89 *season*
