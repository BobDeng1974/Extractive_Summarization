by @entity0 published : 16:02 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 14 september 2013 @entity1 has admitted to his past as a heroin addict , saying the troubled time was the worst of his life he has styled the tresses of scores of celebrities and @entity12 , from princess @entity13 to the @entity14			1
and he still counts the @entity15 and @entity16 among his clients			2
but behind @entity1 ’s perfectly preened locks and boyish charm , he has been hiding a dark secret			1
‘ it ’s my biggest regret , and it horrifies me even now , but i have been in rehab for heroin addiction , ’ he admits			1
‘ this is the first time i ’ve ever spoken about it			1
‘ it was a very short period of my life and i went in with a small but regular heroin habit that i had for a year			1
i am sickened when i look back			2
’ the £ 500 - an - hour hairdresser , who since his early 20s has become as famous as the celebrity clientele of his @entity31 salon , developed his addiction while embroiled in the @entity34 music scene of the 1980s			1
he was part of a crowd that included @entity38 and @entity39 , who both almost died from drug addiction years later			1
though his years in the spotlight have been punctuated with accusations of infidelity and links to prostitutes , it is this brief dalliance with drugs that he laments the most			2
it was only after his then wife , @entity49 , threatened to ‘ kick me out or call the police ’ that @entity1 was forced to face his demons			1
but 27 years later , it is a subject that he still struggles to speak of			2
he has not even confessed to his grown - up children , @entity54 , 27 , and @entity55 , 24			2
@entity1 , 55 , says : ‘ i was secretive about it because they were very young children at the time , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity54 had just been born			0
i had a picture of him with me almost as a newborn that i kept with me while i was in rehab			1
‘ @entity63 had been a very private habit , it was small but regular			0
i never mainlined heroin [ he smoked or snorted it ] – i ca n’t bear all that dirt			1
‘ i was there for ten weeks and they gave me nothing , so i had to go cold turkey			0
i absolutely hated being there			0
‘ i was silent and huddled for a week			0
i felt like my life was being taken over because everything you do becomes psycho - analysed , and i just had to get out of there			1
the celebrity hairdresser found fame in the 80s after opening his @entity31 salon in @entity83 ‘ when people came out they would go to those narcotics anonymous meetings			1
i went to about four and i hated it			0
it was a lot of euphoric recall , and it was so not me			0
‘ i never touched it ever again but i ca n’t erase the past			1
just remembering the smell made me feel sick			0
’ for a man who has lived his life in the public eye , it is hard to believe he was able to keep this dark chapter of his life buried for so long			1
@entity1 ’s life story makes colourful reading			1
his relationships were played out in public , as were the break - ups			0
however , it was his affair with prostitute @entity106 that generated his most vitriolic press coverage – and signalled the end of his relationship with millionaire interior designer @entity111 , who now stars on @entity112 ’ den. five years on from the furore , the stylist says he still has the ‘ utmost respect ’ for his ex-girlfriend , the so - called ‘ queen of taupe ’			1
‘ it might seem odd after everything that was reported but i have fond memories of my relationship with @entity3			0
i ’m not someone who remembers the bad times , so all i will say is that i think she is brilliant			0
’ the prostitute , however , he concedes was a mistake			0
‘ aah yes , i will admit i was n’t thinking in the best sense when i turned to a prostitute and yes , maybe you could call it a moment of madness , ’ he says , shifting uncomfortably in his seat			2
though he is refreshingly honest in his answers , he talks of the incident with a noticeable lack of remorse			0
‘ it certainly is n’t going to go down as one of my best decisions and i ’m not going to sit here and ask for sympathy because , let ’s be honest , i did do it			0
’ royal favourite : @entity1 styled the tresses of the late princess @entity13 in the 80s , and more recently @entity148 of @entity149 the hairdresser still counts @entity15 and @entity16 among his most well known customers his main gripe with the story lies not with the accusations – ‘ the bulk of which are true ’ – but with what he says are smaller inaccuracies in miss @entity106 ’s account of their brief liaison			1
‘ the thing i was most annoyed about was that it said i had @entity164 sheets , ’ he says laughing			0
‘ i certainly do n’t have any bed linen from there , i ’ve never been to @entity164 in my life			2
’ he may laugh it off now , but it was not the first time his infidelity had led to a painful break - up			1
an affair with model @entity173 led to the collapse of his marriage of 20 years to @entity176			2
she was so devastated that she suffered a nervous breakdown			0
‘ to an outsider it may look like i was a serial adulterer , ’ @entity1 admits			1
‘ but i do n’t think that is the case			0
when @entity49 found out we tried to make it work for three or four months , but the damage was done			0
’ @entity1 maintains a relationship with @entity49 , though it is somewhat unconventional , with the pair living four doors away from each other in @entity191 , @entity83			1
they have remained ‘ great friends ’ despite his betrayal			0
@entity49 is the powerhouse behind the £ 50 million @entity1 brand and still has joint control of the empire			1
another one of his long term clients is tv presenter @entity201 , pictured here with the hairdresser in the 1990s he admits he would n’t be where he is today without @entity49			2
so successful was the brand they built that the hairdresser spent much of the early 1990s dividing his time between his @entity31 salon and @entity210 and @entity211 – a long way from the small council flat in @entity214 , @entity215 , where he grew up			1
‘ i was doing mostly the @entity14 , @entity14 , and the @entity216			0
i did princess @entity13 as well , though only a couple of times , ’ @entity1 recalls fondly			1
‘ there was one particular time where princess @entity13 was going to @entity221 in the @entity222 and i went to @entity223			2
it was when @entity14 and @entity13 were very close and going to the event together , so i did both of them			0
@entity13 was just lovely , very friendly , and we were laughing and joking and she even made me a cheese sandwich			0
she was just very charming			0
’ while he is still privy to the salon confessions of the rich and fabulous – @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 are all recent clients – the millionaire stylist claims to have put his philandering behind him and has remained loyal to girlfriend @entity3 for more than four years			2
at 31 , @entity3 is 24 years his junior			0
she was a trader in the @entity237 before she joined @entity1 ’s salon as a trainee hairdresser and later became his personal assistant			1
their love , he says , grew out of that friendship			0
however , the relationship is far from blissful , as the couple have been forced to grapple with @entity3 ’s worsening health issues			0
she was recently diagnosed with lupus , an auto - immune disease that has left her with crippling arthritis and constant exhaustion and she can now only work in the salon part - time			2
and his own brush with serious illness in january this year , when he was diagnosed with a ‘ grapefruit - sized cyst ’ on his liver , gave @entity1 a rare time for reflection			1
after a major operation to remove the mass , he was put on a strong course of antibiotics that caused him to lose a stone in weight			0
‘ the medicine just stopped my appetite and i was drained of all my energy – i felt like an old man			0
’ it was a ‘ frustrating ’ reminder of his own mortality for a man who has worked flat - out since the age of 17 and professes to have ‘ done the hair of all the major divas of this world ’			2
but despite his wild past and celebrity credentials , there is still an endearing humility to @entity1			1
‘ i ’m still just the son of an electrical engineer who grew up in a council flat on the @entity285 , ’ he says , getting up to leave			0
‘ yes , there has been some stuff i would like to rewind or erase from my past			2
‘ but there have been so many moments in my life , for example when i ’ve been kneeling over a bath washing @entity295 ’s hair or even when i just walk into the salon , where i can hardly believe the life i ’ve had			1
‘ i am so grateful for everything			0
life really has been good to me			1
