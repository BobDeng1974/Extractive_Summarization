organic , free range and grain fed are some of the terms commonly found on food labels in the supermarket - but are they really what they claim to be ? consumers are becoming more aware of choosing healthy and sustainable foods after 18 people became infected by hepatitis a last month from supermarket - bought frozen berries imported from @entity13 to @entity14			1
the terms ' free range ' or ' free to roam ' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it does n't all mean the same thing , according @entity50 , general manager at @entity51			1
' in the absence of such labelling laws , it is best to look for " certified free range " or " certified organic " products , although the standards can vary between different certification bodies , ' ms @entity50 told @entity60			1
there are several organisations that certify egg producers , but the ease of access chickens have to the outdoors in sunlight and the number of birds housed in one area can vary			2
consumer group @entity71 is currently campaigning for a nationally enforceable standard for free range in @entity14			1
' @entity76 claims are often used by business in a bid to get consumers to pay a premium and encourage you to buy their product ahead of a competitors , ' @entity71 's @entity74 said			1
' our research has found relying on claims such as free range when making a purchase is largely a waste of money			1
' the terms ' free range ' or ' free to roam ' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it does n't all mean the same thing , according @entity50 , general manager at @entity51 organic in similar circumstances to free range , organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in the country			1
' you can only be certain that you are purchasing truly organic or biodynamic produce and products if it has been ‘ certified organic ’ by one of the seven recognised certification bodies that are accredited and audited by the @entity112 , ' ms @entity50 said			1
' what people forget is that organic farming is actually the traditional way of farming			1
' organic farming nurtures the soil by using compost and other organic fertilisers			1
conventional farming uses synthetic fertilisers , pesticides and herbicides ... to protect plants from pests			0
' many brands can push the organic or natural term by relying on trademarked names even if it includes preservatives , according to @entity71			1
consumers are warned to look out for certified logos on organic products produced in @entity14			1
' some smaller producers follow organic principles but have not sought certification due to the cost involved , so always ask questions of your farmers ' market producer if you are unsure , ' ms @entity50 said			1
organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in @entity14 grain fed this is where animals including chicken and cattle are fed a predominately grain - based diet			1
the feedlot industry , which is an extensive outdoor feed environment where animals are sent to be fattened before slaughter , has grown drastically in the last 10 years due to demand			0
there are about 700 accredited feedlots in the country with large ones holding up to 40,000 cattle at a time			0
while the @entity170 does n't oppose feedlots , the organisation has raised concerns and listed conditions that must be met to ensure good animal welfare			1
grain fed animals can have a damaging effect on the environment , according to @entity51 , because it is resource intensive as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed @entity51 says the process of grain feeding can be damaging			0
' grain feeding is resource intensive and can be environmentally destructive , as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed , ' ms @entity50 said			0
' grain production is also being diverted to animals as opposed to being grown primarily for human consumption			0
' it is estimated that the world 's cattle consume enough food to feed 8.7 billion people , which is more than the entire human population			2
' fresh while supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items that seem like the next best thing to growing your own organically , @entity71 says beyond the packaging it 's a different story			2
' @entity198 ' may conjure up images of hand - picked produce only hours old , but in fact it may only mean it has n't been preserved by freezing , canning , high - temperature or chemical treatment , ' the consumer groups says			1
' it may have been refrigerated and spent time in processing and transport , but it 's still ' fresh '			2
' while supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items , it may only mean it has n't been preserved by freezing , canning , high - temperature or chemical treatment pole and line caught there are various canned tuna options on supermarket shelves , but @entity227 says consumers should always look for the pole and line option where fish are caught one by one with a hook and line			1
they say fewer sharks , turtles , whales and dolphins will be killed because pole and line fishing is selective and more fisherman are employed in the process			0
former chef and host of @entity245 , @entity246 , has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices			0
' pretty much every can of tuna will say made in @entity254 because that ’s the world home of where they tin tuna , ' mr @entity246 said			0
' but it might not come from that water			0
it can come from anywhere in the world			0
if you do n’t tell us where it was caught , saying it was tinned in @entity254 is just a small part			0
' mr @entity246 said labelling laws enabled seafood in @entity14 to be labelled ' made in @entity14 ' even if it was caught somewhere else and just repackaged here			1
' if more than half the value is added , it 's okay , ' he said			0
' i bought some supermarket flathead in @entity276 , but it was actually an @entity279 stick fish			2
legally it is allowed to be called that because of labelling laws			0
' former chef and host of @entity245 , @entity246 , has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices he says about 70 percent of seafood in @entity14 is imported but consumer have been kept in the dark he says about 70 percent of seafood in @entity14 is imported but consumers have been kept in the dark			1
' i do n't have a problem with imported seafood if it 's produced sustainably , ' he said			2
most tuna is currently caught using large - scale industrial fishing methods , which threaten fish stocks and the marine environments that support them			0
but pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way			0
' @entity308 and line fishing is seen as the most sustainable way of catching @entity310 because it is literally a pole with a fishing line on it , ' ms @entity50 said			0
' ( it ) means total catch is easier to monitor , and it ’s easier to avoid ‘ by - catch ’ , which is when unintended fish species get caught in nets and in other destructive fishing techniques			0
' mr @entity246 is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they 're eating , where it was caught and how it was produced			2
mr @entity246 is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they 're eating , where it was caught and how it was produced pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way to fish for tuna and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way ' the only way we can make a conscious decision to choose sustainable seafood , is by knowing for a start , what we 're eating , ' mr @entity246 said			2
' i want people to know what they 're eating so that they think about their seafood and they do n't see the ocean as this bottomless pit that will provide seafood forever			1
' our choices can make a difference and all we need to do is ask what 's on our plate			0
' some people wo n't care			2
they will always buy the lowest price			0
but until we have that information , we have no power to make that choice			2

no legal definition for ' organic ' or ' free range ' labels on food in @entity14
consumer groups warn the term is open for abuse by supermarket retailers
choice says *credence* claims are used to get consumers to pay a premium
while *shoppers* may think they 're buying ' fresh ' food , it may mean it has n't been preserved by freezing , canning or chemical treatment
