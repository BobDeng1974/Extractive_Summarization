admiral @entity0 said he was sure there was the ' odd case ' where agents knew about torture @entity6 spies may have been aware of torture carried out by the @entity8 , a former security minister admitted last night			1
in the most frank official acceptance yet of potential complicity , @entity0 accepted there may have been the ‘ odd case ’ where @entity6 agents knew of mistreatment and may even have been in the building when it happened			1
his comments heaped pressure on @entity19 to order a full judicial inquiry into @entity6 ’s awareness of the barbaric interrogation techniques practised by @entity24 agents and exposed by this week ’s incendiary @entity24 @entity26 report			1
lord @entity0 , who was security minister between 2007 and 2010 , told the @entity32 : ‘ looking back historically , if you are an agent embedded in some foreign country and this was going on , it was quite difficult for them to extricate themselves even though they were n’t implementing that torture			1
‘ so i ’m sure there may be the odd case where an agent was aware what the @entity24 were doing , but that has now been sealed off because they are very clear now what the position is			1
’ campaigners said his comments proved the need for a full judicial inquiry to get to the truth about @entity6 ’s involvement in torture			1
they said the promised probe by mps on the commons intelligence and security committee would not be able to get to the facts			0
@entity53 , a former senior adviser to @entity54 , said : ‘ if the @entity24 can come clean , why ca n’t we ? if this is not done , then a suspicion hangs over our security services			1
we have a right to know			0
‘ but the traditional @entity6 parliamentary scrutiny is inadequate – the intelligence and security committee is not up to it			1
having failed to rise to the occasion after the @entity67 leaks and the question of @entity70 ’s role in monitoring citizens , the @entity60 surely has no credibility in looking into this			0
‘ @entity6 does have a process for investigating issues like this – it ’s a @entity77			2
’ @entity78 of @entity79 said : ‘ we need to know precisely what was done in our name			0
the @entity6 public is tired of being fobbed off with lies , half - truths and inadequate investigations			0
‘ nothing short of an independent , judge - led inquiry will draw a line under this shameful chapter			0
‘ the @entity6 is acting like it ’s afraid to turn over the rock for fear of what it will find underneath			2
’ the @entity96 report said 9/11 mastermind @entity97 was waterboarded 183 times there is already chaos in @entity101 over the extent of ministerial contact with the @entity26 committee and growing fears that the government lobbied to keep @entity6 out of the report			2
it contained no mention of any of the @entity6 security and intelligence agencies when it was published , despite @entity6 ’s close cooperation with the @entity24 in counter-terrorism			1
but it has emerged that @entity6 officials met the committee before publication			0
this led to claims that passages relating to @entity6 ’s role in torture could have been redacted from the report for political reasons			1
yesterday the @entity125 published details of how home secretary @entity127 was among the politicians and diplomats who held meetings with the @entity26 intelligence committee			0
but last night the @entity132 issued an extraordinary correction to the information it had released earlier , stating that mrs may had not met them			0
it said : ‘ due to a clerical error , which we very much regret , the @entity132 ’s @entity140 response of 1 august on contacts with the @entity26 select committee on intelligence referred to a meeting between the committee and the home secretary in july 2011			0
@entity8 director @entity149 defended the use of enhanced interrogation techniques in a press conference in @entity153 , @entity154 ' that was a mistake : her planned visit in july 2011 did not take place and was postponed until september 2011			0
on that reinstated visit in september 2011 , she did not meet the committee			0
’ officials admitted they could not confirm last night whether she may have met leading members on subsequent visits in later years			0
mrs may will face close questioning about any discussions she had with senators on monday when she is due to appear before mps on the @entity171 home affairs committee			0
and yesterday it emerged that @entity173 , who led the @entity26 investigation , could also come to the @entity6 to answer questions on @entity6 ’s role			0
the judicial inquiry promised by mr @entity19 into @entity6 ’s involvement in torture and headed by sir @entity180 was ditched in favour of the @entity60 investigation			1
@entity183 says a full judicial inquiry could happen if the committee failed to answer all the questions			1
former @entity8 @entity186 said he would use the method of waterboarding again , if it meant saving ‘ thousands of @entity24 lives ’			1
during an interview with @entity191 , he added : ‘ would i waterboard again @entity97 , the architect of the 9/11 killings and beheader of over 40 people ? ‘ would i waterboard him if i could have a good chance of saving thousands of @entity24 or , for that matter , other allied individuals ? yes			2
’ @entity200 's top @entity6 terrorist was captured after @entity8 spies tortured former @entity203 detainee @entity202 , it was claimed today			1
crucial information provided by mr @entity202 while he was being held helped identify ' dirty bomber ' @entity205 who was plotting terror attacks on @entity207 , according to the long - awaited publication of a report into @entity8 torture programmes in the wake of 9/11			1
the report claims that drawings by mr @entity202 – who claims to have been beaten and deprived of sleep in @entity203 – helped lead @entity6 security services to @entity205 , who had gone to ground in @entity207			1
former @entity217 ( left ) rejected claims he provided information which helped track down @entity200 terrorist @entity205 ( right ) in 2004 @entity205 – also known as ' @entity221 ' or ' @entity222 ' – was tracked down in 2004 before being found guilty two years later of planning to detonate a dirty bomb and launch an attack on the @entity225			1
the revelation will prove highly controversial as it appears to contradict the findings of the @entity26 's intelligence committee report which found that the @entity8 's ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' did not yield information crucial in stopping terror attacks			1
it even stated specifically that torture techniques – including waterboarding , rectal feeding and sleep deprivation – at @entity203 were not central to @entity205 's arrest , or any other significant breakthrough			2
the report criticises the @entity8 for making ' inaccurate ' representations that ' enhanced interrogation ' was effective and necessary in producing ' otherwise unavailable intelligence '			2
@entity203 , @entity242 , where mr @entity202 was sent after being arrested in @entity243 in 2002 the government asked for information to be kept out of the @entity24 @entity26 report detailing the scale of torture in @entity8 prisons , it emerged last night			1
after initially insisting that no representations were made to keep secret evidence about @entity6 complicity in @entity8 interrogation programmes , @entity183 yesterday changed its story			2
asked on wednesday about requested redactions , @entity19 ’s official spokesman said there had been ‘ none whatsoever , to my knowledge ’			0
but yesterday his deputy said : ‘ my understanding is that no redactions were sought to remove any suggestion that there was @entity6 involvement in any alleged torture or rendition			2
' but i think there was a conversation with the agencies and their @entity24 counterparts on the executive summary			0
‘ any redactions sought there would have been on national security grounds in the way we might have done with any other report			0
’ it said @entity205 's arrest ' resulted from the investigative activities of @entity6 government authorities			2
' but the report also described how mr @entity202 not only suggested where @entity205 – an old acquaintance – might be found in @entity207 , but provided a sketch good enough to identify him , according to report footnotes revealed in the @entity289 today			1
one reference in the report states : ' while still in @entity243 custody , @entity202 provided reporting on @entity6 - based extremists in the context of terrorist training camps , including information on an individual who would play a key role in ' @entity221 's ' identification and capture			1
' in october 2003 , @entity8 officers wrote : ' our latest information , based on [ foreign partner reporting ] and a detainee 's assessment [ @entity202 in @entity24 military custody ] , is that @entity221 is believed to currently be located in @entity308 , a suburb of @entity207			1
' according to the @entity8 document , @entity202 's ' description and resulting sketch of @entity6 contact @entity313 ' – whose true identity was then unknown – ' was compared to a still shot of an unidentified man taken from a surveillance video of @entity6 extremists			1
' the comparison ' revealed that the man in the video probably [ was ] the elusive @entity313			0
' just months later , in august 2004 , @entity205 was arrested			0
mr @entity202 has also reacted furiously to the claim			2
in a letter to @entity289 last night , lawyers for mr @entity202 rejected any suggestion that he ' volunteered or co-operated in the provision of information to any intelligence service '			2
they added : ' insofar as he was tortured and under extreme and unlawful continuing duress for three - and - a - half years in @entity329 and @entity203 he , as every other individual subject to such treatment , can not be regarded in any proper sense of the words to have ' given or provided information ' voluntarily			0
' mr @entity202 was arrested in @entity243 in 2002 , and was held at @entity329 , @entity335 , before being sent to @entity203			0
he was among former detainees who received an out - of - court payment over claims @entity6 officials were complicit in his torture			2
mr @entity202 was arrested again this year – accused of attending a terrorism training camp in @entity342			0
but the charges were dropped in october after it emerged @entity345 knew of his activities .			0

lord @entity0 accepted there may be the ' odd case ' where agents were aware
*bombshell* claim increases the pressure on *pm* to launch judicial inquiry
comes after @entity24 report exposed scale of @entity8 torture of terror *suspects*
@entity53 , former senior adviser to @entity54 , said : ‘ if the @entity24 can come clean , why ca n’t we ?
report did not include any reference to @entity6 intelligence services
but it claimed information provided by detainee helped stop @entity6 terrorism
information provided by @entity202 helped identify @entity205
@entity6 terrorist was plotting ' dirty bomb ' terror attack on @entity207
