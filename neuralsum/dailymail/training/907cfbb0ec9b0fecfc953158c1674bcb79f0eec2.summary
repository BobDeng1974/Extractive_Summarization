by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 has backed @entity4 ’s decision to retire from international football and believes it is ' great ' for @entity7			1
the 34 - year - old has experienced a difficult and emotional 48 hours after he made public the news that he would bring the curtain down on his 114 cap @entity12 career but he has received significant support from his club manager			1
with @entity7 set to embark on their first @entity19 campaign since 2009 , @entity4 ’s quality and experience will be crucial if they are to navigate the group stages and @entity2 will need the 34 - year - old refreshed for the challenge			1
‘ first of all i spent lot of time talking with @entity4 on the matter , ’ said @entity2 during a press conference at @entity24 , ahead of @entity7 ’s friendly with @entity43 , which will be staged in the early hours of thursday morning			1
‘ i know how much it means to him to captain his country and there is no doubt he has been a wonderful captain			0
but you ca n’t forget that @entity7 means everything to him and missing out on international will make him fresher for the @entity19			2
‘ for us at @entity7 , it 's great but it brings to an end what has been a great career for him			2
’ @entity2 has been one of the busiest managers in the transfer market this summer and is close to finalising an £ 8.5million deal for @entity94 ; the @entity96 international has started a medical here in @entity1 , the results of which should be known on thursday			1

‘ our vision for the game really suited @entity124 ’ qualities and i told him that when i took over , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ you could see that was the case over the last two years with the goals that he scored and the way that he played			0
that philosophy wo n’t change			0
‘ the personnel might change but the principles remain same : we want to be defensively strong , with good organisation ; we want to retain possession for as long as we can and score goals			0
we ca n't replace @entity124 like for like but there are others we can bring in who can bring other facets			2
’ see of red : @entity112 poses with @entity7 fans during the club 's tour of @entity149 still the king ! @entity112 signs autographs for fans as @entity7 train in @entity149 stretch to it : @entity155 warms up as @entity7 train in @entity1 during their pre-season tour why always me ? @entity155 takes a break from training to seemingly complain about something one player for whom @entity2 had particularly effusive praise was @entity164 , the £ 10million signing from @entity166			1
he returned to training at @entity51 after suffering with a tight calf and the @entity7 manager believes he will be an outstanding purchase			0
‘ i watched him quite a bit last season , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ the only position he did n't play was in goal or centre forward			0
@entity180 had great trust in him , to play him in important positions in big games			0
he is a real talent with pace , power and fits our profile perfectly			0
