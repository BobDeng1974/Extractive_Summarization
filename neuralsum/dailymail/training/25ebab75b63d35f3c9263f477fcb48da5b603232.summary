at first glance , it would be difficult to identify @entity2 as a serious threat to the security of the @entity5			1
as a student at @entity8 , he would turn up to demos in his trademark hat and white tracksuit daubed with inane , contradictory political slogans			1
on his chest he had drawn a marksmen ’s target inviting police to ‘ aim here ’			2
he had an anarchy symbol on his stomach and on his shoulder he had scrawled a hippyish slogan ‘ @entity22 ’			2
protest mode : @entity2 's antics were derided by many students yet , according to @entity28 intelligence agents , @entity2 – the 28 - year - old son of a baptist minister – is a key figure in a sophisticated gang of hackers who targeted some of the @entity28 ’s most sensitive computer networks			1
an indictment presented before a grand jury in @entity37 , says @entity2 tried to steal confidential data and told three other hackers ‘ we can do some hilarious stuff ’ with information they obtained , adding that they could even ‘ f * * * with the @entity28 government ’			1
speaking yesterday for the first time about his arrest at his parents ’ @entity51 home , @entity2 said it was a ‘ surreal ’ experience			1
at 6pm on friday , october 25 , his mother answered the door to a police officer posing as a delivery man			2
when she confirmed her son was there , more than a dozen officers charged in			2
‘ i was in my dressing gown , pyjamas and a t - shirt when i went through into the hall , ’ said @entity2 , a slightly built and softly spoken man			1
occupation : the 28 year old man from @entity67 , @entity51 would turn up at demonstrations in a trademark white hat with slogans written on his t - shirt ‘ suddenly i was grabbed and handcuffed			1
it was a very surreal experience – i was very tired because i had been on a work programme and getting up very early			2
‘ a man sat across the kitchen table from me and said i was facing serious charges of hacking into computers in @entity28			1
‘ they searched the house for hours and took away my computer and mobile phone			1
i was not formally cautioned but put into the back of a police car			2
‘ they could n’t get the seat belt on so the policeman who sat next to me had to hold the belt while we raced through country lanes			2
‘ the police called in a local solicitor and on his advice when i was questioned on saturday morning i made no comment			2
‘ i was questioned for an hour and a half by two people from the @entity97 who kept asking me if i had attacked the computers in @entity28			1
they wanted to know what data i had taken , what i had done with it and where was it stored – and who else was involved and how much i had been paid to do it			2
’ if extradited and convicted , @entity2 faces ten years in a @entity28 jail			1
but what led to @entity2 being accused of hacking into @entity109 and @entity110 databases to steal ‘ massive amounts ’ of confidential information ? is this yet another example of @entity28 ’s heavy - handed approach when it comes to relatively harmless , if obsessive , computer geeks ? or should we be concerned that @entity2 ’s computer wizardry poses a real threat ? @entity2 was brought up in a deeply religious family			1
his @entity123 father , the @entity122 , worked at a number of @entity126 churches after marrying @entity127 , a teacher from @entity128			2
the family moved to the small village of @entity130 , near @entity67 , five years ago			2
mr @entity2 , 60 , is a vicar at the nearby @entity131 and his wife , 59 , teaches inmates there			1
data : the former @entity8 student allegedly told other hackers ' we can do some hilarious stuff ' with the information @entity2 is one of five children			1
it was during his 20s that his fascination with the internet and political activism took hold			0
he dropped out of @entity147 , completed a year of compulsory national service in the @entity128 army – he has dual citizenship – and worked in a genetics laboratory			0
he went to @entity152 to study physics and molecular biology , using @entity155 to chat to fellow computer whizz - kids			0
bizarrely , he named his @entity155 account @entity158 , after a major general in the @entity160			0
his activism came to the fore and he became a ringleader of a campaign to fight cuts at the university			0
‘ i shared their energy and passion for things – not just politics , ’ he said			0
‘ i was one of those who took the initiative – it was not an abstract theory , it was real and i felt that i was making a valid contribution			0
i became deeply embedded in the movement			0
’ his infatuation with the @entity180 culminated with him living in a tent in the city and abandoning his studies			0
it was only when his parents intervened that he returned to @entity51			1
‘ i had become acutely depressed and really unable to look after myself – i felt worthless and at times suicidal , ’ he said			0
‘ since then i have been at home and for the last year or more i have felt i could n’t move outside the four walls of my bedroom			0
’ ' surreal experience ' : the 25 - year - old said he was in his pyjamas when he was arrested at his parents ' home in @entity130 , @entity51 he claims he has been diagnosed with acute depression and anxiety , conditions from which he has suffered since childhood			1
however , to other students at @entity152 , he was an attention - seeker			0
his hat with a @entity203 playing card lodged in the rim earned him the nickname ‘ the t * * * in the hat ’			2
fellow student @entity208 , 23 – who did not want to give his real name – recalled their first encounter at a lecture : ‘ he arrived ten minutes late			0
he took out several items from his bag – none of which was a notebook – and placed them down on the desk in the loudest and most disruptive way possible			0
‘ @entity2 would just sleep , read the newspaper , or disagree with the lecturer whenever possible			1
if he managed to remain awake , he would cough and blow his nose loudly to cause further disruption			0
everyone thought he was an egocentric , infuriating person			0
’ when students protested against spending cuts in february 2011 by occupying the university ’s @entity229 , @entity2 revelled in the limelight as a leader of the sit - in			1
he was pictured alongside left - wing singer @entity234 , who visited the occupation as it attracted nationwide media coverage			0
however , the university ’s student union condemned the occupation and the police evicted the students			0
while he was popular with the protesters , @entity2 was widely disliked by most of the student body			1
he was booed when he took to the stage at a public meeting about the occupation			0
the seven – month protest eventually ended that august			0
the graffiti on walls cost thousands of pounds to repair			0
at anti-austerity protests in @entity253 a few months later , he was again a key player			2
however , fellow students such as @entity208 believe that @entity2 ’s grandstanding was simply an attempt to boost his ego			1
‘ it seemed as though he did n’t care for the cause , ’ he said			0
‘ he only cared about doing it to make him feel better about himself			0
’ @entity2 ’s arrest on hacking charges has not elicited much sympathy from those who knew him at @entity152			1
one alumnus said : ‘ he was , and i presume still is , an egotistical creepy hippy t * * * who did n’t respect women ’s personal space			0
uncertain future : if extradited and convicted , mr @entity2 faces ten years in a @entity28 prison ‘ do n’t think many who came across him in the student movement will be particularly sympathetic to his current situation , which i am sure is a result of his ego yet again			1
’ if @entity2 is a sophisticated hacker and the claims of the intelligence agents are accurate , he is certainly not very good at covering his tracks			1
a nine - page court document claims that @entity28 agents found the breaches of security came from a domain paid for by a @entity289 account linked to an email account in @entity2 ’s name			1
that payment was said to be linked to an @entity294 address in the @entity295 owned by @entity296 in @entity51			1
to @entity298 , who successfully fought attempts by the @entity28 government to extradite her son @entity301 over hacking charges , the bid to extradite @entity2 is another example of @entity28 ’s relentless pursuit of ‘ young @entity295 geeks ’			1
the @entity306 successfully campaigned to prevent mr @entity301 , who suffers from @entity308 ’s syndrome , from being extradited after he hacked into @entity110 and @entity310 computers to look for evidence of the existence of extra-terrestrials			0
miss @entity298 said : ‘ they are just young geeks sitting in their bedrooms ; they ’re not murderers , they ’re not selling secrets , they ’re just searching for information			0
‘ @entity319 was meant for terrorists , not some young @entity295 geek			0

@entity2 , 28 , is accused of stealing confidential @entity28 government data
was in his pyjamas when he was arrested at his parents ' house in @entity51
would turn up at a @entity8 protests with trademark white hat
