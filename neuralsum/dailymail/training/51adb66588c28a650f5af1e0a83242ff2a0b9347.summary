it is a gift that they have come this far			0
' we can only pray that there is a future for them			0
we are trying all we can to help them and we ’re speaking to experts from all over the world to see if there ’s any chance of surgery			0
but it is looking unlikely at the moment			0

and while one baby is sleeping , one is crying			0
the baby on the right side of the body is also growing faster ‘ when my wife started to feel pain in her stomach we rushed to see a doctor			2

it was all in god ’s hands , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m their father so i ’ll do whatever i can for them			0

’ @entity47 , 28 , has only seen a photo of her conjoined babies and is yet to meet them			2
her husband and three - year - old daughter @entity124 are with her throughout the day as she regains her strength			2
the babies have now been moved to one of @entity1 's top hospitals to see if separating them is possible dr @entity54 said : ‘ she is feeling mentally drained and does n’t feel strong enough to see her babies yet			1
' her husband will tell us when she ’s ready			0
we can only imagine what she must be feeling , it ’s a very sad case			0
’ dr @entity54 said last week : ‘ the parents are very distressed and we are helping the family the best we can			1
' the babies , who together weighed 7lb 7oz when they were born , will remain at @entity138 and be closely monitored			1
dr @entity54 said : ' so far they are doing remarkably well			0
it is a gift that they have come this far ' dr @entity141 , paediatric surgeon in charge of the babies while at @entity138 , said : ‘ we ’re in the process of working out their anatomy and the extent of their fusion			2
' their respiratory elements are infected right now so we ’re trying to treat that and we need them to stablise before we can move forward			0
‘ we will be doing further tests next week			2
this is a very rare case , it ’s very complex but we ’re hoping further testing will tell us more of the right way forward			0
’ @entity47 and @entity70 , who have one other daughter , were too poor to have an ultrasound during the pregnancy so complications had gone unnoticed			1
fears : the baby 's mother gave birth to conjoined twins in @entity169 , northern @entity1 , last week and doctors initially feared their chances of survival were slim dr @entity54 added : ‘ we only came to know she was carrying conjoined twins after an ultrasound two weeks ago but it was too late to do anything by then			1
conjoined twins who share a single body have dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment			1
because they share the same body , it is not possible to separate dicephalic parapagus twins			1
@entity184 doctors say @entity186 twins born this month in @entity187 in the country 's @entity188 have a good chance of eventually being separated , if they survive the first few weeks after being born			1
the twins were delivered at a rural hospital weighing in at 4.3 kg and were immediately put on a life support machine			1
the siamese twins were delivered at a rural hospital in @entity184 weighing 4.3kg and were immediately put on a life support machine doctors at the local hospital , who said they had never had to deal with siamese twins before , arranged for the two babies to be sent to the larger @entity202 , where they remained in intensive care largely as a precaution			1
doctors say that at the moment all the indications are that despite the fact the twin babies are small and comparatively weak , their vital signs are essentially steady , and there is a good chance they will survive			2
the pair are connected from the chest to the stomach			2
but doctors believe they do not share vital organs , raising hope it might be possible to separate them when they are older the pair are connected from the chest to the stomach , but doctors believe they do not share vital organs and therefore it might eventually be possible to separate them when they are older			1
doctor prof. @entity224 who is in charge of looking after the conjoined twins said : ' at the moment , the twins ' vital signs are steady , if anything they are breathing a little fast and they seem to have a low blood oxygen level but other than that everything is stable			0
' he said that the priority at the moment was to focus on sorting out their breathing difficulties and making sure that they ate enough in order to stabilise their vital signs			0
a full investigation will then be carried out to see whether separation operation will eventually be feasible .			0
