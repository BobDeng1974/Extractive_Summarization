@entity0 has described how she lived in a ‘ constant state of guilt ’ as she struggled to juggle caring for her ailing parents with looking after her children			1
the @entity7 newsreader ’s mother @entity5 died of cancer in 2011 and her father @entity9 died just 18 months later			1
but because she lives in @entity10 with her husband @entity11 and their children @entity14 , 16 , and @entity15 , 12 , she was unable to spend as much time as she wanted with them at their home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
miss @entity0 , 50 , said : ‘ when both my parents were unwell i was in that situation that will be very familiar to many women			2
i had young children in one part of the country , and elderly unwell parents in another			1
‘ i was in a constant state of guilt			1
was i there enough for my mother ? was i there enough for my children ? i was trying to do my job at the same time and also i had a husband to think of			1
trying to manage all that was difficult			0
‘ these two people had done everything for me , and would do anything for me			0
i could never really have done enough back			0
’ miss @entity0 – who also presents the @entity39 – revealed she also feels she is not always up to scratch as a parent			0
she told @entity41 : ‘ what kind of mother am i ? one that falls short – every day			2
speaking to @entity44 , ms @entity0 said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out ‘ and now that my kids are 12 and 16 i ’m terminally uncool , which is faintly depressing			1
even being on the telly is just not remotely cool to them			0
‘ the other day we did the @entity39 in @entity10 and i said to my husband , “ do you want to come with the kids ? ” he said yes , but he rang at about 2pm and said “ i ca n’t persuade the kids to come ”			1
’ miss @entity0 said she prefers to spend time with her family than go out in the evening			1
‘ when i started presenting i ’d get invited to red carpet events and i went to a few premieres			0
but pretty soon i thought , “ life ’s too short ”			0
if you work and you want to see your children , something ’s got to give and for me , it ’s my social life			2
’ she also spoke about her 20 - year marriage with mr @entity11 , whom she met when she worked for an advertisement agency and he was the director			0
‘ i did n’t necessarily think he was @entity69 immediately , but i did pretty soon after , ’ she said			0
‘ by the time i turned 29 ... i was pretty sure we were heading towards marriage and so – it sounds so terrible when i tell this story – i said to him , “ i ’d like to be married by the time i ’m 30 but i ’d rather like you to ask me ; i do n’t want to ask you ”			2
’ she added : ‘ do n’t ask me the secret to a good long - term relationship – i have no idea ! honestly , i think it ’s just luck			0
