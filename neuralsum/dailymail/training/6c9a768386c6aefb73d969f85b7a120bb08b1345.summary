manager @entity0 has challenged his @entity2 team to raise their game against direct title rivals and deliver a first @entity6 crown for a decade			1
the @entity8 host managerless @entity9 on saturday , and are out to make a flying start to the new campaign , with morale high following last weekend 's 3 - 0 win over a makeshift @entity14 in the @entity15 at @entity16			1
after ending their nine - year barren run with an @entity20 final victory in may , @entity0 is confident @entity2 - boosted by the Â£ 30million summer signing of @entity22 forward @entity23 - have the platform on which to mount a sustained assault on the championship			1
' it is difficult to know how much better the other teams will be			0
we have some challenges we have of course to face that we did not face well last year , and that means we have to take more points from the top teams			1
' that will be our real challenge this year and also to keep the consistency against the teams who do not fight for the championship			2
' we finished fourth last year and made 79 points			1
@entity14 won it with 86 , so it was very tight in the top four , that is one or two games			0
' if you win against them , they have three points less and you have three points more , that means it is down to one game			2
' so it is very difficult to predict			0
the only thing you know is that it will be tough			0
' full steam ahead : @entity83 jogs during @entity2 's final training session ahead of the new campaign showing the way : @entity0 points the direction to goal			1
the manager has urged his players to kick on from last season 's @entity20 success and mount a sustained challenge for the @entity6 coming for you : @entity35 picks out the camera as he leaves the training field with @entity83 @entity0 added : ' with the confidence ( of winning a trophy ) there is a little bit of weight off the shoulders that is for sure , but we want to show that and transform that into efficiency in our performances			1
' @entity2 are , of course , not the only side to have brought in more firepower this season			1
wenger feels ' six or seven teams ' could offer a genuine challenge			2
he said : ' the favourites you have again @entity118 , @entity14 , @entity119 , @entity120 and us			0
then you have @entity124 , they were very dangerous last year as well and could be candidates			0
how well will @entity126 respond ? ' there is no hierarchy in the teams i give you , there is no priority - they are just the obvious candidates			2
' searching for options : @entity136 looks up as he tries to pick out a pass here we go again : the @entity2 squad warm up as they make their final preparations for the season ahead in the corner : @entity143 works on his set - pieces during friday afternoon 's session @entity0 remains pleased with the transfer business done so far , much of it early with @entity149 international @entity148 , promising young defender @entity34 and @entity151 goalkeeper @entity150 all now on board			1
@entity2 have been linked with @entity155 's @entity154 midfielder @entity153 , whose wage demands are thought to be a stumbling block , as well as @entity159 defender @entity158			1
' number wise we are maybe a little short in some areas of the game , but the depth of the squad is very good , ' said @entity0 , who would like @entity165 and @entity166 to remain at the club rather than go out on loan			0
' we are not destabilised and i feel it 's a strong reinforcement of our squad			0
will i still do something ? i do n't rule it out			0
' the @entity2 boss added : ' for me a big signing is a good player and for you ( the media ) it is linked with the amount of money you spend			0
kicking out : @entity180 prepares for the training session by stretching his legs overlap : @entity180 bursts forward to support @entity183 ' sometimes you have to do both together , but sometimes you can find a big player without having what you call a big player			0
' @entity154 @entity190 winners per @entity191 , @entity83 and @entity35 are to be given more time to prepare for the season following their extended summer break , and so are not expected to be in consideration for next week 's @entity196 play - off first leg against @entity197			2
@entity0 is confident @entity2 can get the better of the @entity9 , who will have @entity199 in charge following @entity202 ' shock departure , before turning attentions to the trip to @entity205			1
he said : ' we play against @entity9 , who are an uncomfortable team for everybody , but i believe the way we can put pace and dynamism in our game can help us prevail to have a good start			0
