by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 5 july 2013 updated : 10:56 est , 5 july 2013 over : @entity1 has quit @entity3 @entity2 to focus on her new album and world tour @entity1 has quit as judge on @entity3 @entity2 after two series of the show , causing another blow to the @entity11 talent competition after dwindling viewing figures			1
the singer confirmed the news on @entity15 , stating that the promotion of her new album must ' take priority			2
' ' i 've absolutely loved my time on @entity3 and i hope everyone saw and knows how passionately i felt about the show			0
however , i ca n't wait to promote my new record around the world and that has to take priority , ' @entity1 , 25 , wrote on friday			0
the @entity27 singer went on to say : ' i shall be keeping a very close eye on series three , showing my support in every way i can , and really hope that in some way that i can be part of the show			1
' audience figures for the second series failed to match those of the first run in 2012 , however during the final month of the show , they increased just as disabled contestant @entity40 was crowned the winner			1
but @entity42 voiced his concern over the result , tweeting after the final : ' @entity40 is amazing ... # @entity46 ... but we know who has the incredible # voice '			1
his act @entity51 was the bookies ' favourite , however she did n't have the public 's backing in the end , despite achieving four top 30 hits in the @entity58 chart prior to the final			1
now @entity1 will be leaving behind @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 on the judging panel , but there is no guarantee the other celebrity coaches will not follow suit			0
in the past the judges have said that they take an ' @entity70 ' approach to the @entity72 talent competition , and would only continue their roles if they all were in it together			0
but the merits of winning the series have also been called into question as the previous winner @entity91 , mentored by the @entity93 warbler , sold fewer than 1,000 copies of her debut album			1
despite her departure , @entity1 may have some involvement in the third series which the broadcaster announced would take place next year			2
farewell : the singer will be leaving behind @entity60 , @entity61 and will.i.am on the judging panel not goodbye : despite confirming her departure , the @entity11 hope she will return to perform on series three worth the time ? the first series winner @entity91 only sold 1,000 copies of her debut album 4/11 @entity60 , @entity61 2/5 will.i.am 5/2 @entity110 5/1 @entity111 8/1 @entity112 , @entity113 / 1 @entity114 , @entity115 / 1 @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 / 1 @entity120 / 1 @entity119 , @entity121 / 1 @entity122 , professor green20 / 1 @entity123 , @entity124 / 1 @entity127 / 1 @entity126 / 1 @entity125 , @entity128 / 1 @entity129 , @entity131 / 1 @entity130 , @entity132 / 1 @entity134 / 1 @entity133 , @entity135 / 1 @entity136 , @entity137 / 1 @entity138 , @entity139 / 1 @entity141 / 1 @entity140 , @entity142 the short - haired singer had already had to postpone a major tour because of her commitments to @entity3 a few months ago and her second album had to await completion until the show had ended			1
the @entity11 's entertainment team also confirmed the singer 's departure via their own @entity15 account , writing : ' @entity1 confirms she 's leaving @entity3 to concentrate on promoting her album around the world			2
' @entity155 , controller of entertainment commissioning , said : ' we 're so sorry to see @entity1 go as she 's been an exceptional coach on - and advocate for - @entity3 , but we totally support her decision to leave due to touring commitments overseas			0
' we very much hope that @entity1 will remain part of the show and come back and perform for us next series			2
in the meantime , we will now start the search for a new coach			0
' @entity168 have suggested a number of potential replacements , giving @entity110 the highest odds at 5/2 that she will be the newest member of the panel			0
will they stay ? with @entity1 's departure , the other judges may follow suit			0
