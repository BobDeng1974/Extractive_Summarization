by @entity0 published : 12:25 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 28 february 2013 a mother has told of her devastation after her baby died after being sent home by doctors several times			2
@entity7 died from pneumonia when he was just seven weeks old , having originally been diagnosed with a viral infection			1
today at his inquest his mother @entity10 broke down in tears as she described the agonising wait in @entity14 while he went into cardiac arrest			0
mrs @entity7 , from @entity17 , north @entity18 , recalled how she and her husband @entity19 had visited a a privately - run out - of - hours gp centre several times before their son 's death			1
@entity24 died from pneumonia despite his mother calling and visiting a privately - run out of hours gp centre several times she told @entity29 that they were first in contact with the @entity32 centre in the @entity33 in north @entity18 on the night of october 30 last year			1
the next morning she took @entity7 to her own gp , who suspected he probably had a viral infection			1
but when his condition did not improve by the following evening , @entity37 and mrs @entity7 contacted @entity32 , and saw dr @entity39			1
mrs @entity7 said dr @entity39 told them @entity7 ’s vital signs were good and his lungs were clear			1
he said the infection was probably viral but he gave them a prescription for antibiotics , so they would not have to return if the baby ’s condition changed			1
mrs @entity7 said : ' i had already presented him with symptoms of @entity7 refusing to feed , and not having a wet nappy , and having difficulty breathing			1
i was n’t expecting him to diagnose my son			0
' he did n’t give any instructions as to what change should mean , or any advice as to how to manage the symptoms			0
' on the next day , the friday , the child continued to be unwell , but mrs @entity7 felt reassured because she had seen a doctor			1
on the saturday , she decided he needed to be seen again			0
she said : ' on the friday , i had allowed myself to be reassured , but my gut feeling was taking over			0
' she called @entity32 , and when dr @entity64 called them back at 12.45 , she said he was ' very abrupt and very short ' and made them an appointment for 4pm			1
' i called a taxi for 3.30 and was very worried by this stage , ' mrs @entity7 said			1
' i arrived at the @entity32 unit at 3.50 , but had to stand in a queue and was told they were busy			1
' there were six people in front of @entity7			2
i could not see his chest move , so i pinched his foot but did not get a reaction			0
' i asked the receptionist when he would be seen , becoming tearful			0
seven - week old @entity7 was treated at the @entity32 centre at the @entity33 in @entity18 ( pictured ) before he died ' she explained there were still three people in front of me , so i sat down again			1
' an off - duty paediatric nurse was looking at him , she said , " you need to go through straight away "			2
' she started running and shouting for a nurse called @entity10			0
' mrs @entity7 said that soon after @entity7 was taken from her , she heard he was in cardiac arrest			2
she said : ' it was a tense situation , doctors were almost fighting among themselves to get everything done			0
' but when a doctor came to see me in the relatives ’ room , i knew the battle had been lost			0
' pathologist @entity96 , who carried out the post-mortem examination , said there was evidence of abnormality in the lungs			0
he said there was extensive pneumonia which had been present probably for more than a @entity104 of death was bronchopneumonia , he said			2
dr @entity64 said he set the appointment as ' routine ' and the one he arranged was the earliest available			0
he did not regard the case as urgent from the information he had			0
coroner dr @entity111 suggested to him that the information he gathered in his one - minute telephone triage was not very detailed and he agreed			2
she told him : ' if you are going to take on a task as responsible as triaging a seven - week - old baby , you have to do it responsibly			2
' he said that if there had been such factors as wheeziness or chesty cough , or not eating or drinking at all , he would have marked it as urgent , in which case the appointment would have been within two hours			0
dr @entity125 , a consultant paediatrician who battled to save @entity7 at the @entity33 , said that on two occasions his heart did start , but it could not be sustained			2
he said that , in general , babies this young with significant chest infections will deteriorate fairly rapidly once the infection takes hold - perhaps over 24 to 48 hours			1
' it 's almost certainly the same infection that the entire family had - his sibling and the parents had been ill , ' he added			1
some babies catch a bacterial infection on the back of a viral infection , he said			1
sometimes small babies , even when they are diagnosed and treated , fail to survive , but thankfully these cases are in a minority			0
' the sooner you detect it , the better your chances of survival			0
' the inquest was adjourned until thursday morning .			0
