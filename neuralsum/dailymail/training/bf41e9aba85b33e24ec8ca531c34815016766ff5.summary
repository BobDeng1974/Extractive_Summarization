by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:54 pm on 7th november 2011 calls for the government to ditch its plans to raise the motorway speed limit were dismissed yesterday			1
the @entity7 crash led to safety campaigners urging the @entity9 to abandon plans to increase the 70mph limit to 80mph			1
but drivers ' groups immediately accused them of ' circling like vultures over the @entity7 dead ' and transport secretary @entity16 insisted it was too early to say whether speed caused the pile - up			1
tragedy : as the stretch of the @entity7 reopened today after the 34 car pile up , safety campaigners and driving groups have become embroiled in a war of words over speed limits aftermath : as a fingertip search was conducted yesterday , safety campaigners called for the @entity9 to abandon plans to increase speed limits ' some people have said the weather was particularly bad , ' she said			1
' what we need to do now is focus on what 's happening to the people who have been injured			0
we 'll have a debate about the policy issues in the coming weeks			0
' but @entity43 , spokesman for the @entity44 , said : ' we have said from the beginning that we would not support an increase in the speed limit			2
' higher speed means less time for drivers to react to what 's going on around them			0
our concern is that there will be more serious accidents			0
' and @entity55 , senior campaigns officer at @entity56 said : ' government policy should not be doing anything to increase the number of man - made , unnatural deaths occurring			2
' tragedy : was speed an issue ? in the days after the accident safety campaigners and drivers ' groups have been at odds over the crash fireball : fire crews from @entity71 and @entity72 tackling a blaze on friday evening , since the crash a war of words has erupted over 80mph speed limits ' like a war zone ' : the mangled vehicles at the crash scene on saturday as police worked to clear the wreckage			1
51 people were injured and seven killed in the 34 vehicle pile - up too early : transport secretary @entity16 said it is not yet clear if speed was the cause of the pile up but @entity89 , chairman of the @entity90 , issued a press release under the title ' @entity93 '			0
he said : ' accidents are n't caused by a “ number on a pole ” and the @entity7 disaster will be shown to be no exception			2
' it is clear that the accident involved a number of @entity102 limited to 56mph and below , plus there are question marks over the wisdom of holding a firework display adjacent to the motorway			0
' @entity109 mp @entity108 agreed there should n't be a rush to judgment			0
' we do n't know how fast people were driving			0
' i do n't think people were driving that fast anyway , from the reports i 've heard from the people interviewed who survived the accident			0
so i 'm not sure it was the speed that was causing the problem			0
' a full risk assessment is needed of measures to increase the maximum motorway speed limit from 70mph to 80mph , a motoring group said today			1
today , the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) called on the government to pilot an 80mph limit on a controlled and managed motorway ' to assess its practicality and safety and road users ' reaction '			1
@entity128 chief executive @entity137 said : ' a fifth of motorway - users already travel at this increased speed , and more than half exceed 72mph when they can , suggesting that a properly controlled 80mph limit may not show huge increases in carbon or road casualties			1
' a detailed trial is needed to assess these risks though , and if they are shown to increase significantly , of course a better - enforced 70 limit may be a more appropriate system			2
' blame : @entity152 , chairman of the @entity90 , said : ' accidents are n't caused by a '' number on a poll '' and the @entity7 disaster will be shown to be no exception he went on : ' raising the motorway speed limit has been debated for many years , and the evidence is that the motoring public are ready for it			1
the @entity162 should now publish a consultation with firm proposals			0
' earlier this autumn the then transport secretary @entity165 announced that the government would be launching a consultation on raising the limit to 80mph			1
he said the current speed limit was nearly 50 years old and was out of date thanks to huge advances in safety and motoring technology			2
mr @entity165 said an increase to 80mph would generate economic benefits of hundreds of millions of pounds through shorter journey times .			2

safety campaigners urge the government to abandon plans for increased limit in wake of tragedy
driver groups hit back saying campaigners are ' circling like vultures over the @entity7 dead '
today @entity128 called on the government to pilot an the 80mph limit before going *ahead*
