' devastating ' head injuries : @entity1 , four , had been playing with a heavy fitting - room mirror staff at a @entity5 store where a four - year - old boy was fatally struck by a falling mirror were warned it was dangerous nine months before , an inquest has heard			1
head of shop construction @entity10 told staff at the @entity14 outlet village in @entity15 the three - way mirror needed to be fitted properly in september 2012			1
in june 2013 , the same mirror toppled over onto @entity1 , of @entity18 , @entity19 , who died in hospital four days later after undergoing an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain			1
@entity1 was with his parents , @entity25 and @entity26 , when the incident happened at the @entity14 outlet village at around 8.30pm on june 4 , 2013			1
mrs @entity26 and her son met mr @entity1 after he finished work and had dinner at a @entity33 's restaurant before going to the @entity5 store			1
the four - year - old had been playing with the mirror while his father tried on a suit when it fell			1
an inquest into his death at @entity42 heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free - standing position meant it could easily overbalance			1
mr @entity10 , who has since left @entity5 , told the inquest : ' i clearly remember the three - way mirror was in the wrong location , it was not in the fitting area			1
' i recall putting my hand on the mirror and i said " guys , it ca n't be here , it needs to be fitted properly "			1
' it was not attached to the wall and was masking a gap in the wall fittings			0
i walked to the fitting room and indicated where it needed to go			1
' the three - way mirror was certainly not a freestanding mirror and to leave it standing on the floor would have been inherently dangerous due to its size and weight			1
' it needed to be fixed securely to the wall			0
' mr @entity10 visited the shop just before leaving the company for a new job and sent an email to area manager @entity77 , copying in contractors , containing an update on work at the store a month after it opened in august 2012 , the inquest in @entity72 was told			1
it said another night of work was needed to install items including a three - way mirror , which meant the wall would have to be reinforced			2
he said : ' if i had received notification the mirror was not fitted correctly , i would have taken the necessary steps to rectify that			2
' i was very shocked to hear about the incident			0
' mr @entity10 said @entity5 did not cut corners in relation to health and safety but admitted the job was ' low cost and fast paced ' , taking place at a time when the contractors @entity101 were going out of business			2
accident scene : an inquest at @entity42 heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall of the @entity5 store in @entity14 ( above ) and that its free - standing position meant it could easily overbalance however , @entity101 and @entity111 , a project manager for @entity112 , was brought in to liaise between @entity101 and @entity5 , both claimed no three way mirror was ever installed			1
@entity115 , from @entity114 , told the inquest : ' no mirrors were to be installed			2
the three - way mirror never appeared			2
at the handover , there was no three - way mirror in the store			2
' earlier , @entity5 facilities manager @entity123 told the inquest that shop fittings should only be moved around by contractors and not be employees			1
he said : ' this would have been a shop construction issue			0
' meanwhile , manager @entity130 told the inquest that he checked the fixtures and fittings every day , and that he would have reported any concerns			1
but he refused to answer questions on whether he documented monthly health and safety inspections			2
mr @entity130 told the court that neither he nor any of his staff took down the old mirror or installed the new one as it would have needed to be done ' by a professional '			1
he added : ' i put my trust in the professional person doing that , and to my knowledge it was attached to the wall			0
' treatment : @entity1 was taken to @entity151 ( pictured ) in @entity72 , where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain , but died four days later mr @entity130 said the mirror was in a ' very high - traffic ' area , used by customers and with access to an upstairs section of the shop and a stock room			1
but there were no reports of any concerns from customers			0
he said : ' in the event that there were , i would have addressed and communicated them			0
i would have had no reason not to			0
' mr @entity130 told the inquest : ' the fixtures and fittings were checked daily by myself			1
if there were any concerns they would have been highlighted daily			2
' and he told the court that two risk assessments were carried out at the shop , one by an external company which told him that ' everything was fine and in working order '			2
but when asked by mr @entity184 whether he had documented the monthly health and safety inspections he was required to carry out , mr @entity130 replied : ' no comment			2
' giving evidence : @entity189 ( left ) , the boy 's father , said the shop was not busy when they arrived and that he tried on a number of suits and jackets			2
pictured ( right ) is a closed sign following the incident mr @entity130 - who was not working the day of the incident - told the inquest he had watched the cctv of the incident after @entity1 was crushed			1
he revealed : ' he was waving his arms and legs and pulling the wings of the mirror towards him and then the mirror fell on him			0
' it was approaching a triangle on the floor			0
i believe @entity1 was trying to close the wings around him			2
it happened very quickly , it was not something that was pleasing to watch			0
' earlier , @entity214 , the operations manager in charge of providing cleaners at the store , told the inquest : ' i would come into the store to complete checks and one of them involved running my hand along the top of the mirror to check it had been dusted properly			1
i am 99 per cent certain it was fixed to the wall			0
the mirror is not one that would be suitable to be freestanding on the floor			0
' neither of the cleaners ever raised any concerns about the mirror			0
' mr @entity214 told the jury inquest he received a call on june 5 , the day after the incident			0
he said : ' i went to the store and the mirror had been propped up			0
the wings were not attached and there were shards of glass and a pool of blood			0
' i noticed how heavy it was			0
i was convinced it must have been attached to the wall			0
it makes no sense for it it to be freestanding on the floor			0
' @entity15 coroner @entity253 said : ' the evidence indicates the mirror was not fixed to the wall			0
' on monday , @entity1 's father @entity25 , of @entity258 , @entity19 , relived the moment he heard a ' quick loud sudden bang ' and turned around to see the mirror on the floor			1
an - off duty doctor desperately tried to keep young @entity1 alive before paramedics arrived			1
in a statement , he told the inquest : ' i was walking towards my wife @entity268 to choose a tie and @entity1 was behind me near the winged mirror			1
' i heard a quick loud sudden bang , but no sound of breaking glass			0
i heard someone gasp and i looked and saw the mirror had fallen over			0
' i knew @entity1 was underneath it as it was not lying flat to the floor			0

@entity1 was playing with heavy fitting - room mirror in @entity14
left with ' devastating ' head injuries after it toppled over and crushed him
inquest heard how staff were warned the mirror need to be properly fitted
but warning was never *heeded* - and 118kg mirror was left free - standing
shop manager told inquest he undertook daily health and safety checks
said there were never any concerns about the mirror being able to fall over
