treating this as a sport issue does not reflect the reality of today 's match - fixing industry			0
‘ fixing is organised and executed by the most aggressive and sophisticated organised crime syndicates and structures from all corners of the world			0
as far as they are concerned , match - fixing requires low investment , carries weak sanctions , has no co-ordinated transnational response and generates serious profit			0
and these profits are not spent on cars and mansions			0
they are reinvested in all the other forms of crime that the world works so hard to combat : weapons and people trafficking , prostitution , drug smuggling and so on			0
