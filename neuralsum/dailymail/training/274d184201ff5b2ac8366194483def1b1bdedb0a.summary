when president @entity1 and his family took a six - day @entity4 vacation in 2013 , the @entity0 spent more than $ 2.1 million to protect them , according to documents from inside the @entity6			1
the costs included $ 953,788 for the security details ' hotel accommodations , with the rest chalked up to actual security costs – and ' entertainment			1
' the total of $ 2,189,727 – separate from the whopping $ 8,104,224 in flight expenses – also included $ 11,525 spent on preparations for a safari side - trip in @entity17 that the @entity18 later canceled			1
@entity54 , a center - right watchdog group famed for its @entity56 requests and the grumble - inducing lawsuits they inspire in the federal government 's executive branch , released the documents thursday			1
@entity6 provided the documents more than 10 months after they were first requested on july 3 , 2013			2
' everyone should be able to afford a $ 10 million trip once in a while , and at some point just throw $ 11,000 out the window because – oops , we changed our minds , ' a @entity54 spokesperson told @entity70 exclusively			2
' the problem is that the @entity44 are not spending their own money			0
it is the taxpayers ' money			0
and there is no end in sight to this brazen spending			0
' the @entity79 reported last year that in @entity34 , 100 @entity0 agents were on hand ' as " post-standers " – to man security checkpoints and borders around the president – in each of the first three cities he visits			1
' ' sixty - five are needed to meet up with @entity1 in @entity26 , ' the @entity79 added , working from a classified planning document			0
' in addition , 80 to 100 additional agents will be flown in to work rotating shifts , with round - the - clock coverage , for @entity1 's and his family 's security details			1
' @entity54 president @entity95 said in a statement that ' the @entity44 clearly either do not understand the value of a dollar			2
' however , he added , they ' understand it all too well when someone else is picking up the tab			0
' ' keep in mind , ' @entity95 said , ' that this outrageously lavish excursion came at the very same time that the president was shutting down @entity18 tours and blaming it on the [ 2013 budget ] sequester			1
' ' as one congressional critic noted at the time , the @entity18 could have 1,350 weeks of tours for the cost of the @entity1 family ’s trip to @entity34			1
' welcoming committee : @entity1 received a hero 's welcome in @entity17 akin to the ovations he once commanded in the @entity119 ' a great bang for our buck ' : deputy national security adviser @entity123 ( seated on @entity124 , making president @entity1 laugh ) , defended the tens of millions spent on the @entity44 ' taxpayer - funded week in @entity34 singular sensation : @entity1 's armored limousine traveled along @entity129 in @entity26 , @entity17 , with @entity0 agents ringing the plaza $ 8.1 million airfare : @entity124 costs $ 228,288 an hour to operate in the weeks before the trip , the @entity18 faced uncharacteristically stern questions from reporters about the journey 's purpose and cost			1
during a press briefing on june 14 , 2013 , deputy national security adviser @entity123 told the @entity18 press corps that ' the president is not going to retreat from an entire continent			2
' ' we do n't determine the cost of the president 's security , just as president @entity147 did n't and president @entity148 did n't , ' @entity123 insisted			0
the @entity0 is going to do what they think is necessary to protect the president			0
that 's going to come with its own costs			0
but we do n't sit here and say we want to spend x amount of money on a trip			0
' ' frankly , ' he added , ' it will be a great bang for our buck			0
