teachers complained they are now expected to be ' frontline stormtroppers ' in the fight against @entity5 extremism in school , a conference has heard			1
they said they are now being forced to spy on children during sensitive discussions as a result of new - counter terrorism rules			0
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) suggested that @entity14 strategies designed to tackle extremism and terrorism have instead ' shut down debate ' in schools			1
teachers said they now feel nervous discussing controversial issues over fears they will be pressured to report youngsters who share their opinions			1
they also claimed young people feel unable to express there views on certain subjects , such as the @entity29 killings , for fear of being branded an extremist			1
' the conference heard an example of a student being pulled aside after prayers one friday because children coming out of the prayer room were talking about extremism , despite the fact that the boy had put a strong argument against joining jihadi groups			0
in another case , a boy who applied to go to @entity61 to visit his dying grandfather had his laptop taken from him and searched , with three potential examples of the youngster viewing jihadi websites found			0
when the pupil was questioned , he asked how he could argue against something if he did not understand it			0
in response , the pupil 's @entity73 classmates questioned why they would not be seen as suspicious if they applied to visit their grandparents in @entity77 , the conference was told			0
delegates at the annual conference in @entity80 , @entity81 , raised concerns about the move to require schools to promote fundamental @entity86 values as well as the government 's @entity88 strategy , which is aimed at tackling extremism			0
the strategy suggests school staff can help to identify and refer youngsters whose behaviour suggests that they are being drawn into extremism or terrorism			1
@entity99 , of the union 's executive , described @entity100 as a ' blunt instrument that will do damage and inhibit debate in schools ' , adding that @entity105 should be allowed ' nowhere near these issues '			1
@entity105 now checks that schools are actively promoting @entity86 values like tolerance and democracy as part of regular inspections			0
in the wake of attacks on the @entity29 journalists there were , in some schools , @entity119 pupils who did not feel they could say they were offended by the newspapers cartoons mr @entity99 said : ' we live in a damaged and volatile world , and like us , young people are trying to make sense of it , like us , they 're trying to come to conclusions about cause , effect and solutions , and like us they want a space to discuss it			1
' schools are places where that discussion , on ethical and political issues should take place , in an environment of enquiry , and it may be an environment where young people say things we do n't like , or say things that concern us that we want to address with them , that we want to discuss with them			2
' but @entity100 conflates a notion of @entity86 values and an elastic notion of non-violent extremism that is shutting down that debate			2
' he added : ' we have measures to deal with safeguarding , we have child protection measures , we do n't need @entity100 and we do n't need to involve the police as the first instance			0
' we are hearing young people telling teachers that they do n't want to discuss things , that they do n't want to discuss what happened with the @entity29 shootings , young people who were offended by the @entity29 cartoons , but saying they do n't want to say it in class , they do n't want to say it in schools			2
the conference heard that @entity88 was shutting down debate in schools ' @entity88 is shutting down debate and we must oppose it and we must say schools are places where children and teachers should be allowed to discuss these issues			1
' to loud applause , delegates passed a resolution which includes an amendment calling on conference to confirm it believes ' that schools should be places where young people can discuss events in a spirit of enquiry and openness , and that teachers are well - placed to facilitate such discussions and deal with the expression of unacceptable viewpoints '			2
a @entity190 spokesman said : ' teaching about the fundamental @entity86 values of democracy , the rule of law , individual liberty and tolerance and respect for others is part of our promotion of @entity86 values , and is at the heart of what every school has to deliver for children			0
' we want all schools to promote these values throughout the curriculum , not just as a bulwark against extremism , but as a vital part of preparing young people to get on in life			0
' he added : ' our guidance makes it clear that no teacher or school leader should feel unable to talk about difficult or sensitive issues - indeed teaching about fundamental @entity86 values actively encourages such discussions - but no - one should be using a school to promote views , opinions or beliefs that discriminate against other people on the basis of their background			1
