@entity0 has become the first black @entity2 batsman to play for @entity3 when he came into bat at @entity5 in the second test against the @entity7 at @entity8 on sunday			1
with @entity9 ruled out of the remainder of the three - match series with an ankle ligament injury , @entity0 took his place in the @entity15 line - up , but did not get a chance to bat until day three due to bad weather			1
the 24 - year - old 's debut is a big deal for @entity3 , which has fielded only five black @entity2 players since readmission in 1991 , and has not had any since fast bowler @entity23 's last test at the end of 2009			1
@entity0 plays a defensive shot during his debut , a significant milestone for @entity2 cricket @entity0 was out for 10 , after @entity29 had him caught behind with a vicious rising delivery @entity0 made his test debut for @entity3 against the @entity7 in the @entity32 however , the occassion proved to be something of an anti-climax as @entity0 lasted just 35 balls , before gloving a sharp , lifting delivery behind to depart for 10			1
despite the fact that almost 80 percent of @entity3 's population is black , @entity23 is the only cricketer to have held down a regular place in the national side , taking 390 wickets in 101 tests			2
fast bowlers @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , and wicketkeeper @entity49 , all managed a combined 17 tests			0
' i 've come to realise that there are a lot of people out there that i represent - i 'm not just playing for myself , ' @entity0 said on wednesday			0
' i am aware , but it does n't really change the ballgame for me			0
' born in @entity58 , @entity59 's oldest township , @entity0 was educated at a leading cricket school in @entity61 , and played for @entity3 under - 19s			2
@entity0 is the first black @entity2 to play for @entity3 as a specialist batsman the 24 - year - old , who has a first class average of almost 36 , says he is representing more than himself @entity23 is the most famous non-white @entity2 cricketer , having played over 100 tests he has forged a successful first - class career , scoring 3,631 runs at an average of almost 36 , and hit a career - best 162 against @entity71 during a @entity3 a tour in august			1
@entity3 made one other change to the side that thrashed the @entity7 by an innings and 220 runs in the first test to take into account the different conditions in @entity80			0
the @entity15 fielded an all - seam attack at @entity82 , but the @entity8 pitch is traditionally drier and slower , and so legspinner @entity84 replaced fast bowler @entity85			0
left - armer @entity86 , who was the original spinner in the squad , was ruled out of the series after splitting his left index finger during a training drill on tuesday			0
@entity0 is likely to bat at number 7 for @entity3 , who lead the @entity7 1 - 0 in the three - match series			2

@entity0 comes in for injured @entity9
@entity0 is first black player in @entity15 side since @entity23 in 2009
