by @entity0 @entity1 : 04:19 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 22:36 est , 31 december 2013 a customer who popped out for a lunchtime snack got more greens than she bargained for after finding a dead frog in her salad			2
the @entity9 employee had visited the @entity10 on @entity11 in @entity12 yesterday to get what she assumed would be a regular @entity14			1
but in addition to the tomatoes , tuna , egg and olives , there was an extra ingredient : the small amphibian , almost camouflaged among the salad leaves			2
a @entity9 employee found a dead frog in a @entity14 she bought from a branch of @entity10 on @entity11 / @entity27 @entity28 , digital features editor at the @entity9 , posted a photo of the novel salad on behalf of her startled co-worker who bought the meal and did not wish to be identified			1
@entity28 told @entity33 that her colleague had started the meal at her desk and was ' pretty shaken ' to discover the two - inch long green - brown creature			1
a spokesman for @entity10 said : ' at @entity10 , we take issues like this very seriously			0
' our lettuce is sourced from farms that do not use any pesticides on its produce , therefore organic matter does very rarely manage to pass through our production process			0
' we are currently looking into this issue to make every effort that this does not happen again			0
' @entity51 , vice president of brand marketing for the company in the @entity53 , told the @entity9 that the ' handmade natural food ' sold by the chain is often made from organic ingredients			1
the manager of the @entity10 branch in @entity12 ( above ) has since apologised and given the customer a refund , plus a voucher for a free lunch she added that this could be partially to blame for the frog in the salad			1
ms @entity51 said : ' we do n’t use any pesticides with our greens and they go through multiple washing cycles			0
an unfortunate piece of organic matter has made its way through			0
' the manager of the branch has since apologised and given the customer a refund , plus a voucher for a free lunch			1
and as for the frog : it lives on , as it were , in meme form - including one showing the poor little critter wearing a festive woolly hat			0
... and here 's a live one in a bag last september , a woman discovered a live frog in a bag of washed salad she bought from a high - end supermarket			1
@entity90 , 50 , had already eaten some of the salad leaves before her youngest daughter , @entity93 , noticed the amphibian lurking in the bag			0
the frog was found in a bag of mixed leaf salad bought from a branch of @entity100 in @entity101 the frog had survived despite being trapped in the plastic packaging for more than 24 hours			2
mrs @entity90 , a health care manager from @entity106 ’s @entity105 near @entity101 , @entity107 , bought the mixed leaf bag from her local branch of @entity100			2
she ate some of the leaves for her lunch , but the green and brown frog was only spotted when @entity114 , a 20 - year - old university student , prepared dinner that evening .			0
