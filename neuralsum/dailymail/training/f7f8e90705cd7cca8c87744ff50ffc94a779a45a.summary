@entity131 is a genetic disorder that disturbs cell growth in the nervous system , causing tumors to form on tissues			1
the tumors are usually benign , but in some cases they become cancerous			2
people with neurofibromatosis often experience only mild symptoms including light brown spots or soft bumps on the skin , freckling in the armpits or groin area , bone deformities , learning disabilities and a larger than average head size			2
effects can range from hearing loss , learning impairment and cardiovascular complications to severe disability due to nerve compression by tumors , loss of vision and severe pain			2
neurofibromatosis treatment aims to maximize healthy growth and development and to manage complications as soon as they arise			2
when the condition causes large tumors that press on a nerve , surgery may help ease symptoms			2
some people may benefit from other therapies , such as stereotactic radiosurgery , medications to control pain or physical therapy			0
