billions of pounds of @entity2 aid money is paid with almost no checks on how it is spent , mps warned last night			1
ministers have been urged to do ‘ much more ’ to safeguard the £ 4.9billion a year given to agencies after hearing that officials make only two visits to inspect countries where the @entity2 does not have its own aid programme			1
@entity2 gives 60 per cent of its aid – one of the highest levels – through agencies such as the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 who decide how to use the money			1
worrying : billions of pounds of @entity2 aid money is paid with almost no checks on how it is spent , mps warned last night the @entity23 prefers to have direct control – through bilateral arrangements – of how its money is spent and only gives 26 per cent of its aid to multilateral groups			1
in a highly critical report by the @entity32 international development committee , @entity20 said they were shocked that @entity2 officials made only two visits to see for themselves how the money was spent			1
committee chairman sir @entity36 said : ‘ we accept that country visits are not the only way of gathering evidence			2
‘ for a number of multilateral organisations , the @entity2 has a seat on the board , which obviously provides us with some oversight			2
‘ nevertheless , we feel strongly that ... the team should undertake more visits to countries in which the @entity2 has no bilateral programmes			1
’ the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) has boasted of slashing the administration costs on its own projects to around three per cent			0
expensive : @entity2 gives 60 per cent of its aid - one of the highest levels - through agencies such as the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , pictured , who decide how to use the money but @entity20 said this misleading because so much aid cash is now spent with organisations whose costs are often at least twice as high			1
the report warned cost cutting at home was creating ‘ a perverse incentive for @entity49 to allocate more of its money to multilaterals , many of whose administration costs are far higher for the wrong reasons			0
’ it went on : ‘ @entity49 ’s allocation of funding should not be guided by the desire to “ export ” its own administration costs			0
’ mps also voiced surprise that @entity49 had continued to fund a series of organisations despite warning two years ago that they offered poor value for money			0
a major review by @entity49 in 2011 found that nine of the organisations it funded , including five run by the @entity17 were performing poorly			0
but despite this @entity49 has continued to fund four of them			0
a further nine organisations given the second lowest rating of ‘ adequate ’ have had their funding increased by £ 97million , equal to a 12 per cent rise			0
@entity49 last night defended its approach to funding multilateral organisations , but said the process was kept under constant review			0
a statement said : ‘ the @entity102 process , introduced by this government , provides a rigorous assessment of the value for money of multilateral agencies and is a model that has been adopted internationally			2
‘ we remain determined to get better value for money and more effective aid from multilateral agencies			2
