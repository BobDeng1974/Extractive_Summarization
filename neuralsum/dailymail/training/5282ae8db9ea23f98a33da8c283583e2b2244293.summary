by @entity0 a post-exams house party ended in chaos after 100 dancing students felt the floor collapse beneath their feet			1
revellers at the rented student house in @entity8 , @entity9 , were plunged into the basement after the living room floor fell through under their combined weight			1
guests described how ' everyone was screaming ' as the floorboards caved in , throwing up clouds of dust			1
' as soon as this happened i tried to get out through the patio door but the floor lurched down again and then this dust cloud came up and i got some in my mouth and it was minging			1
' then everyone started to push forward to get out through the patio door and no one could actually get out			0
i got really squashed because i was right on the edge			0
everyone was screaming just proper going it for trying to escape			0
' ' everyone was screaming ' : one student described the chaos as party guests fell into the basement nobody was seriously hurt in the accident , though some students were cut and bruised and emergency services had to be called in			1
local fire crews came to the scene and also searched the building in case anybody had not made it out after the collapse - though they quickly found that nobody was unaccounted for			2
a spokesman for @entity66 and @entity67 said it was lucky nobody was badly hurt in the collapse - thought to have been caused by rotten timber			2
the basement in the house was only three feet deep - unlike many of the surrounding properties - meaning revellers avoided the ' far more serious ' consequences of a further fall			2
disaster selfie : @entity28 student @entity27 , left , described the collapse , and also posted pictures of her wounded leg outside : the student house is in the @entity8 area of @entity9 the spokesman told the @entity85 : ' we had to evacuate people and search the building to check that nobody was trapped			1
' other houses in the street had basements that were much deeper , so if it 'd happened in another house , it could 've been far more serious			0
' the house 's landlord - who asked not to be named - added that there had never been a problem before during the 20 years he had owner the house			0
he also said a recent safety inspector found no problems , and that an ' unprecedented ' number of people had been inside at the time .			0
