a woman who was unable to leave the house for 14 years due to depression , is finally on the road to recovery			1
@entity5 , now 60 , from @entity6 , became depressed while going through a divorce in 1991 and was so stressed , her hair began falling out			1
too embarrassed to leave the house thanks to her non-existent locks , ms @entity5 became a recluse for more than a decade but has now regained her confidence following a pioneering hair treatment			1
new life : ms @entity5 lost her hair after succumbing to depression but has now had a treatment to regain it ms @entity5 's problems began during her divorce which , although amicable , left her the single mother of two young children			1
that , combined with a high pressure job and a diabetes diagnosis , resulted in a seriously stressed ms @entity5 falling prey to depression			1
although referred to a psychiatrist , her experience was not a happy one with the mother - of - two passed from medic to medic and prescribed an increasingly lengthy list of medication			2
' because i was only able to see registrars ( people training to be psychiatrists ) , i would see a new person every year			0
' they would ask the same questions over and over which would open up the wounds again			0
i was trapped in a cycle			0
' things became worse when the resulting stress , coupled with her severe depression , left her hair falling out in clumps			2
thinning : the stress of a divorce coupled with a diabetes diagnosis caused her hair to fall out in clumps hospitalised following a heart attack the following year			1
ms @entity5 found herself unable work but was turned down when she applied for benefits			1
' it was both financially and emotionally devastating , ' said the former tachograph inspector , who says it was around then that she hit ' rock bottom '			0
' all i did was cleaning , ' she remembers			0
' it was something to keep me busy as i could nâ€™t get out the house and it kept my mind occupied			0
' in 2000 , she met her future husband @entity66 , who was immensely supportive , taking care of both her , and her two young sons			0
' he helped me emotionally as he was the only one at the time who could put up with what i was giving out , ' she says			0
' he also financially supported me , and was just there for absolutely anything i needed			0
' her mother and sons also proved supportive and it was her mother who happened upon the hair treatment that has helped to restore her confidence			2
restored : hair expert @entity81 ( left ) designed a treatment that restored her confidence after some convincing , ms @entity5 agreed to see hair loss specialist @entity81 , who created a bespoke hair replacement system			1
five weeks after starting treatment , her hair began to grow back and according to ms @entity5 , she finally began to feel like herself again			2
indeed , so dramatic has the transformation been , ms @entity5 is finally leaving the house on a regular basis once more - something she had not done for 14 years			1
' @entity5 is a beautiful person with an amazing , kind , warm personality , ' explains @entity95			2
' to help this much in her life is truly an honour			0
' we fitted @entity5 with a bespoke hair replacement system with real hair which @entity5 is able to treat and wash as if it were her own hair			1
' although we have not known @entity5 long the whole team truly loves @entity5 and it is a pleasure to work with her			0
' while tackling depression is an uphill battle , @entity5 now has a renewed fighting spirit and has now booked to go to @entity107 , @entity108 and the @entity109 .			2
