@entity1 human rights judges rejected former labour cabinet minister @entity3 's claims to have been unfairly treated by a parliamentary inquiry former labour cabinet minister @entity3 suffered a fresh humiliation yesterday when @entity1 human rights judges rejected his claims to have been unfairly treated by a parliamentary inquiry			1
mr @entity3 said parliamentary authorities had been wrong to punish him after he was exposed trying to use his status as a former defence secretary to make large sums of money			1
but the @entity13 brusquely rejected the charges as ‘ manifestly ill - founded ’			1
the defeat meant the end of a legal battle lasting nearly five years that began when mr @entity3 was caught out by a newspaper sting in march 2010			2
mr @entity3 , who was still an mp at the time , went to a meeting with a company calling itself @entity22 and discussed providing it with advice on defence matters			1
he told company executive @entity26 that he was looking forward to ‘ translating my knowledge and contacts about the sort of international scene into something that , bluntly , make money			0
’ he told miss @entity26 that he charged £ 3,000 a day			0
but the consultancy was really a front for the @entity35 and @entity36 ’s @entity38 programme and mr @entity3 , who was at the time a special adviser to the @entity39 , was one of a number of politicians targeted			2
others included one - time @entity45 ministers @entity43 and @entity46			0
mr @entity3 ’s exposure was followed by a complaint by another mp to parliamentary authorities , and an inquiry by the @entity51			1
the @entity51 called on mr @entity3 to apologise to the @entity51 , and it effectively banned him from the @entity52 by withrawing his parliamentary pass for five years			2
mr @entity3 , who was defence secretary from 1999 to 2005 , and a cabinet minister until 2009 , complained to the @entity56 human rights court that the inquiry was not a fair trial and interfered with his civil rights , and that by damaging his reputation it had breached his right to a private and family life			1
former cabinet minister @entity3 , was secretly filmed ( shown here ) by the @entity36 programme dispatches over his apparent willingness to help a firm in return for cash the @entity56 judges , headed by @entity71 @entity70 , said that mr @entity3 had no reason to complain that he did not get a fair hearing because the dispute was political and not a matter of his civil human rights			2
it said his complaint was inadmissible			0
it also rejected his complaint under @entity81 of the @entity1 human rights charter , which protects private and family life			0
the human rights court said that although the damage to his reputation caused by the inquiry might have breached his human rights , the @entity51 had followed the rules of the @entity51			0
