by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity3 went into hibernation during the bitter polar vortex winter this year - and the @entity3 economy slumbered along with them , dropping a stunning 2.9percent in the first quarter of 2014			1
the sharp drop from january through march is the biggest dip since the @entity11 shaved 5.4percent off the @entity12 five years ago			1
it is one of the biggest contractions outside of a recession is recent history			0
economists believe most of the contraction was the result of a short - lived slowdown in spending due to an abnormally long and and harsh winter that disrupted shipping , shut down factories and kept consumers away from shopping malls and auto dealerships			1
the first - quarter contraction reported wednesday by the @entity30 was even more severe than the 1 percent annual decline it had estimated a month ago			1
besides the harsh winter , much of the downward revision reflected a drop in health care spending			1
another factor was a bigger trade deficit than initially estimated			0
drop : the economy shrank by a stunning 2.9percent in january through march of this year - thanks largely to a terrible winter most analysts also foresee the economy expanding at a healthy rate of around 3 percent in the second half of this year			1
reports on consumer spending , manufacturing and business investment have shown a solid rebound this spring			1
orders for big - ticket manufactured goods excluding military hardware and for core capital goods , a proxy for business investment , rose strongly in may , a report wednesday showed			2
' we have ample evidence that the first quarter was just a temporary setback for the economy , and we are climbing out of the hole in the current quarter , ' said @entity63 , chief economist at @entity64			2
last quarter 's 2.9 percent annual decline in economic activity , as measured by the gross domestic product , followed a 2.6 percent gain in the fourth quarter			0
it was the weakest showing since the economy shrank at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2009 in the midst of the @entity11			2
most of the downward revision from the government 's previous estimate of a 1 percent annual decline reflected a change in the estimate of spending on health care			2
the government had previously estimated a strong gain in this category reflecting implantation of provisions of the @entity87			1
but data derived from an actual survey showed the government 's estimate was far too optimistic			0
health care spending , instead of rising at a 1 percent rate , had fallen in the first quarter at a 0.2 percent rate			2
a long , nasty winter kept many shopper home , shut down factories and derailed deliveries in the first quarter of 2014 analysts say solid hiring , growth in manufacturing and surging auto sales are contributing to a stronger economy			2
a stumbling housing recovery has been a concern			0
but even there , recent data on home sales and construction have been encouraging			0
' the larger contraction in @entity12 in the first quarter is not a sign that the @entity3 is suffering from a fundamental slowdown , ' said @entity115 , senior @entity3 economist at @entity116			0
if economists are correct that annual growth will reach around 3 percent in the second half of the year , it would be a sharp improvement from the 2 percent annual pace of the first five years of this subpar economic recovery			1
' we should have a much better second half this year and a much better 2015 than 2014 , ' said @entity126 , chief economist at @entity127			1
@entity126 said he 's forecasting growth of 3.5 percent to 4 percent in 2015			0
if he 's correct , that would be the strongest year since the economy grew 3.8 percent in 2004			0
' in past recoveries , we have always gotten a year of very strong growth , ' @entity126 said			1
' i think we will get that in 2015 , ' helped by a long - awaited improvement in wage growth			1
of course , the optimistic projections could prove too rosy			0
analysts see risks to their forecasts , primarily the possibility that tensions in the @entity142 could cause oil prices to surge given the deteriorating crisis in @entity145			0
surging energy prices have preceded earlier economic slowdowns , including the most recent recession .			0

most economists are *n't* worried about the dip and see it as a temporary contraction because of the harsh *weather*
*healthcare* spending shrank *0.2percent* as @entity87 of implemented
*experts* predict *3percent* growth for the second - half of the year
