by @entity1 reporter published : 12:18 est , 23 may 2013 updated : 19:52 est , 24 may 2013 eight - year - old @entity2 has an iq of 130 but she has been known to slap , bite and pull the hair of her teachers after quickly losing her temper when she feels she is not being listened to a girl of eight with suspected autism has been expelled from three schools as her parents wait desperately for her to be assessed for special educational needs			1
@entity2 is extraordinarily bright , with an iq of 130 , but finds it difficult to control her temper and lashes out at pupils and teachers when upset			1
her parents , @entity16 and @entity17 , are convinced their daughter has @entity20 ’s syndrome but she is not entitled to the special teaching she needs until she is diagnosed by a doctor			1
the couple , who run a soft play centre and have two younger children , have been waiting almost a year to get a medical assessment			2
in the meantime , @entity27 has just been excluded from her third school after violent tantrums were too much for the teachers			1
mr @entity32 , 53 , said : ‘ we are a family that is going through hell			2
we are at the end of our tether			0
’ he and his wife , from @entity40 , @entity41 , say @entity27 ’s behaviour deteriorated two years ago when a new teacher arrived and the layout of her classroom was changed			1
mrs @entity2 , 42 , said : ‘ @entity27 ca n’t cope with change and for her that was a huge change to her daily routine			1
her behaviour deteriorated and before she was expelled we were getting calls on a daily basis			1
’ @entity27 ’s troubles at school started taking up so much time , her parents said they had to give up their business to care for her			2
she was excluded from her first school in april last year after she started pushing other children and then kicked and punched teachers who tried to stop her			2
she was excluded again in september last year , and last monday her latest school had also had enough			0
despair : @entity27 's parents @entity16 and @entity64 believe that their daughter is a sufferer of @entity20 - a type of autism that means sufferers have difficulty communicating ‘ the problem is that staff are not trained to look after pupils like @entity27 and so , by trying to diffuse the situation , they actually just escalate it , ’ mrs @entity2 said			1
last december , despairing teachers even locked @entity27 out in the playground on her own for an hour to try to calm her			2
lessons : @entity27 is now having to be home - educated through an online programme ‘ we were so angry when we heard about this , ’ her mother said			1
‘ this is just an example of how they have no concept of how to look after a child with @entity27 ’s condition			0
‘ she views things differently to us			0
the slightest things can set her off , such as if she ’s dressed in different coloured trousers to her sister , or if someone brushed past her			0
we know what sets her off and can usually stop it before it starts but other people just ca n’t get a grip on it			0
’ ‘ we feel completely let down by the system			0
the help @entity27 needs is not available and we ’re having to go through hell to try and get it			0
’ @entity27 has now been offered a place at a special school in @entity108 in september			0
she would have to board during the week , because there are no suitable schools for her in @entity41			1
her medical assessment is not due until october			0
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ we ’re hoping that , after she has the assessment , she will be taught ways of understanding her condition and how to manage it , so hopefully in the not too distant future she will be able to return to a school nearer home			1
’ she added : ‘ i ca n’t even begin to explain the impact this has had on our family and the longer we have to wait for an assessment , the worse it ’s going to get			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity128 and @entity127 , which plans local health services , said it was examining the circumstances of @entity27 ’s case but could not discuss details			0
