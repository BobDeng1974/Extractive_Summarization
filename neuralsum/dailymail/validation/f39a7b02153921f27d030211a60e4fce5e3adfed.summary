@entity0 was n't built in day , and it certainly was n't for rural postman @entity1 , who dedicated 33 years of his life constructing an incredible limestone palace , complete with pillars , buttresses and grottoes			1
the widower would often find unusually shaped rocks as he delivered mail in @entity11 , and ended up pushing a wheelbarrow each day on his 18 - mile route to collect stones of beauty			1
what started as a small hobby , soon became a life project in 1879 , resulting in one of the most magnificent amateur architectural structures to date ; @entity1			2
the idea for the elaborate cathedral came when he tripped over an unusually shaped rock in his 30s			0
he later wrote in his journal : ' i wanted to know the cause			0
in a dream i had built a palace , a castle or caves			0
i told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and i felt ridiculous myself			0
' i said to myself : since nature is willing to do the sculpture , i will do the masonry and the architecture			0
' @entity1 would haul his findings to a site in @entity42 every day after work , and thus began the ambitious 33 year project , completed with no outside help			1
the dedicated builder would often have to work well into the night , by the light of an oil lamp , but that did n't deter him from his mission			0
@entity1 would construct the palace at night , after work , by the light of oil lamps			1
in 1969 , @entity73 , the minister of culture , declared the @entity75 a cultural landmark and had it officially protected the website for the palace states it was built with no architectural rules and is regarded as a great example of outsider artwork due to the long hours of the project , the widower left his son in the care of godparents , in order to be able to focus his energies on his work			0
the outer walls , measuring 24 metres in length , and 10 metres high , took 22 years to complete , with @entity1 binding the stones together with lime , mortar and cement			1
@entity1 is as intricate as it is vast , and includes sculptures of exotic animals and mythical creatures , which were inspired by the postcards he delivered , and with influences from @entity104 and @entity36			2
the structure is beloved by visitors today , 100 years after it was constructed , and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986 when @entity1 died , he requested that he could be buried at the palace			1
sadly it was not permitted and the talented constructor ended up building his own mausoleum for himself in the cemetery where he was buried after his death in 1924 , a year after finishing the palace			0
the structure is beloved by visitors today , 100 years after it was constructed , and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986			1
perhaps most poignant explanation for the architectural wonder is the inscription carved into the palace by @entity1 : ' the dream of one man			2
