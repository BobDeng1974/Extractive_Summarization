@entity0 took on its first female pilot in 1987 and has been actively recruiting more women to its top ranks ever since			1
as of 2013 , the airline had more female pilots than any other @entity7 carrier , though @entity0 's director of flight operations , captain @entity8 insists that the ' number does n't nearly represent the general population			0
' in response to the lack of women pilots , @entity0 has launched an 18 - month ' @entity15 ' in recent years - a cadet training scheme , which is open to all			1
@entity19 , a precursor to @entity0 , romanticised airline stewardesses in the 1950s anyone between the ages of 18 and 55 is welcome to apply and no previous flying experience is necessary			2
as of 2013 , the programme had attracted over 5,000 applicants for fewer than 100 places			0
nevertheless , the number of male pilots continues to outnumber female pilots 18 to one , with just 200 women pilots out of 3,500 flying for @entity0			2
a 1960s @entity33 advert encouraged passengers to ' think of [ their flight attendant ] as your mother ' this @entity39 advert from the 1960s shows a woman demonstrating her ability to balance four teacups with hopes that the numbers will continue to rise , we take a look back at the profound shift in recruitment tactics that has taken place over the years			1
it 's clear that many airlines used to look to females as ' trolley dollies ' or ' mothers ' who were there to serve you while on - board			0
men , on the other hand , were encouraged to try their hand at flying , using military - inspired language to make the job that much more appealing			0
advertisements for male pilots , however , made references to the military and inevitable in - air romances a @entity71 advert from the @entity72 depicts only men as pilots - or as chefs , for that matter even recently , @entity78 's magazine adverts showcase flight attendants as stylish waitresses ( left ) and though some airlines still show sexualised images of female flight attendants in their adverts , the push toward women taking on high - flying pilot roles is evident			1
one of the most notable female - helmed flights in recent memory took place in march 2008 when @entity0 ' first female pilot , capt @entity91 , was selected to land the initial flight to touch down at @entity94 's @entity93 on march 27 , 2008			2
and for all those ladies looking to take to the skies , the next application window for the @entity15 is expected to open in february 2015 .			0

in response to low *industry* numbers , @entity0 launched future pilot programme
recruiting tactics have changed , with more women encouraged to apply
these *vintage* adverts show *stereotypical* 50s and 60s recruitment *rhetoric*
