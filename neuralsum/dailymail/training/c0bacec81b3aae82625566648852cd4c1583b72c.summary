it 's been known for years that some @entity1 and @entity2 share ancestors , and new research claims to have confirmed this link by discovering they also share language traits			0
scientists from @entity9 used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to discover a direct link between the @entity14 family of languages in @entity16 , and the @entity18 languages of @entity19			1
their findings also revealed the migration of people from @entity23 to @entity16 around 13,000 years ago may not have been a one - way trip - with some people returning home to @entity19 , taking their language back with them			1
scientists from @entity9 used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to discover a link between the @entity14 family of languages of @entity16 tribes and the @entity18 languages of @entity19			1
stock illustration of an @entity34 is pictured in 2012 , dna research found genetic markers that linked people living in the @entity39 republic of @entity40 , southern @entity19 , with indigenous populations in @entity16			1
scientists believe that during an ice age between 15,000 and 20,000 years ago , inhabitants of @entity19 crossed a stretch of land known as the @entity47 into @entity16			2
this stretch of land is now buried under the waters of the @entity47 and @entity51			0
by studying mutations in the languages of these two regions , scientists found a lineage shift approximately 13,000 and 14,000 years ago - when the inhabitants are thought to have made this journey across the ice			1
however , because of the wide spread of languages , and the fact links still remain in @entity19 , the researchers suggest some of these migrants returned home			1
this map shows the outlines of @entity19 , left , and @entity67 , right , with dashed lines			2
the broader area in darker green represents the @entity47 used by @entity71 to travel into @entity16			0
the latest linguistic research , however , suggests some siberians may have returned home , taking their language with them an engraving showing @entity1 running , shooting arrows and throwing balls in @entity79 during the 1500s			1
most native americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a ' land bridge ' between @entity23 and @entity16 during the ice ages more than 15,000 years ago to investigate this further , scientists used a technique originally created to investigate evolutionary relationships between biological species , called phylogenetic analysis			1
this involves creating a tree that represents relationships of common ancestry based on shared traits			0
the researchers used a linguistic version of this phylogeny to discover around 40 languages that had diffused across @entity16 and @entity23			1
they began by coding a linguistic data set from each of the languages and establishing relationships between this data			2
they then applied these links to the known migration patterns from @entity23 to @entity16			2
the people we know as @entity1 arrived at the continent in three separate great migrations			0
most native americans are descended from a small group of migrants that crossed a ' land bridge ' between @entity23 and @entity16 during the ice ages 15,000 years ago			0
these migrants , known as the ' @entity119 ' , populated most of @entity120			0
by studying variations in @entity125 dna sequences , a team of scientists recently found that while most of the @entity125 populations arose from the first migration , two subsequent migrations also made important genetic contributions			0
the second and third migrations have left an impact only in @entity133 populations that speak @entity135 languages and in the @entity137 who speak a na - dene language			0
eskimos show the most differences , with just 50 per cent of their dna coming from the ' @entity119 '			0
the findings highlight an early dispersal of @entity14 along the @entity16 coast with a @entity18 back migration through @entity19			1
study co-author dr @entity147 said : ' we found substantial support for the out - of - @entity47 dispersal adding to a growing body of evidence for an ancestral population in @entity47 before the land bridge was inundated by rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age			2
' he added that although they can not conclusively determine the migration pattern just from these results - and stated the study does not necessarily contradict the popular tale of hunters entering the @entity165 through @entity47 - it , at the very least , indicates migration may not have been a one - way trip			1
' this work also helps demonstrate the usefulness of evolutionary modeling with linguistic trees for investigating these types of questions , ' concluded dr @entity147			0
the research was published in the journal @entity177 .			0

study used a technique called linguistic phylogeny to analyse languages
researchers found a link between the *current* @entity186 and the @entity18 languages of @entity19
around 40 languages were found to have diffused across @entity23 and the @entity190
the findings also reveal that migration may not have been a one - way trip
this diffusion of languages suggests some people returned home , taking their *dialects* with them
