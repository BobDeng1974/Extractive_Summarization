the petite star of @entity15 and @entity16 - who is also the face of @entity19 make - up - took part in a photo shoot for @entity22 with make - up artist @entity23			1
@entity24 pout : @entity8 sports thick lashes - courtesy of make - up artist @entity23 - and her natural show - stopping pout in the @entity22 shoot admitting that she 's ' always loved @entity31 @entity30 films and @entity33 ' , the tiny @entity32 channeled the @entity35 beauty with ethereal make - up accentuating her enormous green eyes and bee - sting lips			1
@entity39 , who lives in east @entity32 with her artist boyfriend @entity40 , began acting as a child with a starring role in the tv adaptation of @entity46 's @entity45			1
she went on to play @entity48 in @entity49 on @entity50 's , while also finding time to complete a degree in @entity52 at @entity53			2
talking about her make - up routine , the actress - who says her favourite look is ' a strong eye and nude glossy lip ' - explained : ' i use @entity60 every day , then apply foundation , mascara , eyeliner and blusher			1
i always take my make - up off at night and moisturise			1
' watch a behind - the - scenes video of @entity8 ' @entity67 speaking about her love of @entity19 , she said : ' i was always really passionate about their designs , so it was exciting when they asked me			1
' there ’s such a sense of theatre in getting glammed up ; it ’s like putting on a play or short film			1
and i love the make - up from this current collection			1
' @entity83 - eyed beauty : @entity8 has been signed as the new face of @entity19 make - up classic look : ' there 's such a sense of theatre in getting glammed up ; it 's like putting on a play or short film ' @entity93 ' lashes are a fun way to play with texture , whether you go for natural , coloured or dramatic ones			1
before you apply them , dust a soft wash of shimmery peach eyeshadow [ @entity103 used @entity105 's @entity104 ] over the lid and do the same once the glue has dried to create a seamless finish			2
for the lips , mix balm and gloss for hydration and subtle shine			2
' tip : if you do n’t like wearing falsies , load up on at least four coats of mascara			2
@entity119 ' @entity121 , defined brows really complement these looks			2
they perfectly frame the fluttery lashes and give the metallic textures and dewy skin more of an edge			2
once you ’ve applied your foundation , take a clean cotton bud over your brows to remove any residue			0
next , brush up your brows to help locate any sparse areas , then take an eyebrow pencil in the same colour as your brows to fill in any gaps			0
' tip : use soft , feathery strokes and a clear setting gel to keep your brows in place			0
platinum eyes ' a strong eye and nude lip is very @entity31 , but this has a modern feel thanks to the textures			0
blend a powder eyeshadow over the entire lid , take the colour up over the crease , out into a wing shape , then down along the lower lash line			0
you can enhance the colour by applying cream eyeshadow over the top			0
for the lips , use a creamy nude lipstick , then add lots of clear gloss			0
tip : ' match your manicure to your pout with high - shine nude nails , ' says shoot manicurist @entity164			1
@entity165 ' this look is so pretty and fresh for this time of year , as it prevents winter skin looking dull and flat			0
it is n't about creating a tan , it 's about adding shimmer and iridescence			0
begin with liquid foundation – warm it up on the back of your hand first , so it melts into your complexion and creates an almost second skin			0
next , you want to highlight and accentuate your features , so apply a pearlescent cream or powder over your cheekbones			0
finish the look with mascara and a strong , dark eye			0
' tip : only use blotting powders if essential – you need that extra sheen in the winter			0
