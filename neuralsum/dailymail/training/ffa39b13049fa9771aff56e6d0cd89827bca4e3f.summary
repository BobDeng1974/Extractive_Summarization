state education superintendent @entity1 has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools			1
some sales can take place for certain , approved fundraisers , multiple media outlets reported sunday			0
the prohibition started last july under the @entity22 provision of the @entity23			2
districts protested the ban , saying it hampered the ability of volunteer groups to raise money for activities like field trips			0
schools must apply for a waiver to allow snacks that do n't meet low - sodium , low - sugar , low - fat limits to be sold in schools on certain days			1
' i am pleased to issue guidance today allowing schools to hold a limited number of fundraisers exempt from the federal smart snacks rules , ' @entity1 wrote in a memo obtained by the @entity45			1
' the flexibility enables local decision - making , rather than forcing us to follow mandates from the federal government			0
schools now have clear , common - sense guidelines in place that will benefit students and local communities			2
' @entity1 's plan will , in its first year , give schools around 90 days during which they may sell candy and other junk food for fundraisers			1
the second year , they 'll be allowed closer to 60 days			2
the third , they be allowed to sell the non-compliant food around 30 days			1

@entity3 's lifting of the ban -- which the state says will allow ' fundraisers ' that include junk food a certain number of schools days per year -- comes as part of a backlash against the @entity12 - backed @entity23 while many schools have implemented the new standards successfully , others have said it 's not working for them			1
the schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for more whole grains are particularly challenging , while some school officials say kids are throwing away fruits and vegetables they are required to take			0
the changes have been pushed by the @entity97 , a group that counts both school nutrition directors and the food companies that produce many of the school foods among its members			0
the group said this week that a survey it conducted of more than 1,100 school lunch operators showed that more than half predict program expenses will exceed revenue this year			0
advocates for the healthier meal standards say the changes will take time			0
they predict there will be fewer problems as kids get used to the new foods and the food industry creates more tasty products that follow the standards , like whole grain pastas and tortillas that are now required to be served			0
as schools have complained , @entity121 has shown some flexibility in tweaking the standards			0
in 2012 , just a few months after the first rules went into effect , the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry			0
and @entity121 said earlier this year that schools can put off for two years a requirement that all pastas in schools be whole - grain rich , or more than half whole grain , if they can demonstrate that they have had ' significant challenges ' in preparing the pasta			1
despite a barrage of criticism -- and a growing trend in which students post their ' gross ' lunches with the hashtag # thanksmichelleobama , mrs. @entity12 this summer said she would fight ' until the bitter end ' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools			2
