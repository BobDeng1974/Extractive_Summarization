the @entity1 site , the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since @entity4 , has become a tourist attraction			1
local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area , explaining what has become of the disaster zone			1
back in 2011 , three of the @entity13 's six reactors blew up following a tsunami , releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated			1
@entity17 has been abandoned since the nuclear blow - up back in 2011 locals hope opening the area up as a tourist attraction can stimulate a mass rebuild however , with contamination levels said to be ' low ' , people are being permitted on whistle - stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place			1
although there were no fatalities from radiation exposure , 300,000 residents were moved from a 20 - mile radius of the nuclear plant			2
in total there were nearly 16,000 deaths reported from the natural disaster and subsequent devastation			2
three of the six reactors blew up when a tsunami measuring 9 on the @entity41 hit the region			2
clean - up expected to take decades , and cost more than £ 18 billion			0
an investigation panel deduced the disaster had major elements of being ' man - made , ' and there was a '' culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management			1
' when asked what people say when they see the area for the first time , tour organiser @entity52 told @entity58 : ' at first , they say unbelievable			2
' with soil and water contaminated , nobody can live there yet , and it is unknown when the clean - up mission will be completed			0
former residents like @entity66 are optimistic that @entity17 can be rebuilt , but the pain of what happened is still raw			1
' actually i 've come here several times but still … i can not say anything			0
' the nuclear plant is still being taken apart , and it is estimated it will take decades to make the area safe , as well as cost billions of pounds			2
surveys show only a fifth of former residents want to return to living in the area			0
however , tour guides hope by educating tourists and sharing their experiences of what @entity1 once was , people can be inspired and help rebuild the prefecture			1
@entity52 added : ' we want to encourage local people for the revitilisation of @entity1			0
' contamination levels are low , which means people can , for a limited time , view the destruction site a tsunami led to a terrible chain of events that still sees @entity1 uninhabitable to this day the plant has six reactors , three of which were offline when disaster struck on march 11 , 2011			1
a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems , leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors			0
decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate , time - consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment , as well as all the extra fuel rods , which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings			0
workers , who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant , must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote - controlled and radiation - resistant robotics to deal with it			0
the process is expected to take at least 40 years .			0

@entity17 *decimated* by nuclear disaster back in 2011
government tour guides now educate tourists about the disaster
locals hope one day the prefecture can be inhabitable and rebuilt
