prince @entity0 , dutiful fellow that he is , has announced that he will be taking six weeks of paternity leave			1
@entity3 willing , his wife the @entity2 will give birth to their next child in a few days ’ time , at which point the @entity0 , having been excused from training with @entity9 , will roll up the sleeves of his @entity12 shirt and tell his beloved as she lies , exhausted , on her maternity hospital bed : ‘ o duchess of my dreams , i am at your beck and call , coiled like a watchspring to hold milk bottles and change nappies until the first week of june ’			1
six weeks ! some of you may find this sweet			1
you will look at the earnest young @entity25 , with his well - meaning smile and that receding hairline ( join the club , sir ) , and you may think : ‘ there goes a properly modern man ; what a fine example he sets to the rising generation			2
how lovely , you will say , that the next - but - heir to the throne is in tune with metropolitan sensibilities , alive to the rip - tides of 21st - century cultural politics			2
he may be a prince of the realm , surrounded by hot - and - cold - running flunkeys , cocooned by the coroneted appurtenances of royal life , but under it all he is a new man , bowing to convention like a willow branch in the flood			1
how unlike his father , the fogeyish prince @entity70 — who at the time of his engagement to @entity68 , when asked if he was in love , gave a sighing , unromantic answer which included the throwaway phrase ‘ whatever “ in love ” means ’			1
unlike his mouldering pop , @entity75 accepts — embraces ! — the mundane and sometimes stinky burdens of early parenthood			2
and so , for the next six weeks , and possibly beyond , the @entity0 will be on domestic parade , quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home , @entity84 , in @entity85 , like a guardsman doing sentry duty outside @entity88			1
hrh new @entity91 , in his nursemaid ’s pinny , will be there to ‘ do his bit ’			2
and yet , at the risk of committing lese - majeste , i must confess that when i heard of the @entity0 ’s undertaking i thought ( and continue to think ) : ‘ for @entity3 ’s sake , man , are you @entity102 ? ’ i say this , furthermore , as a committed royalist and father of three			1
' for the next six weeks , and possibly beyond , the @entity0 will be on domestic parade , ' says @entity42			1
' quivering to attention at the nursery door somewhere deep inside their stately home , @entity84 , in @entity85 ' for your royal highness , i have been there and have glimpsed your immediate future			1
i have tried paternity leave , albeit briefly			1
so far as i could see it was an almost complete waste of time			2
our first - born , @entity118 , arrived in july 1997 , in the early days of the @entity121 terrors			2
@entity122 had been in office but a few weeks and the country was in the grip of a mini social revolution that saw the old @entity128 ways washed aside by political correctness			1
even so , i absented myself from the birthing suite at @entity132 maternity hospital ( i had nearly fainted when the anaesthetist produced his epidural needle , long as a medieval jousting stick )			2
i retired to a nearby pub for a pint or two of goodish cider			2
as i made my excuses and left the hospital , the midwives looked thoroughly relieved			2
they knew what no nurse ever seems prepared in public to admit : men in a maternity ward are a flat - footed menace			0
' they knew what no nurse ever seems prepared in public to admit : men in a maternity ward are a flat - footed menace , ' says @entity42 , who says he made it through just a week of his own paternity leave i can claim to have changed @entity118 ’s first nappy — i remember the moment vividly , as my wife looked on cluelessly — and i also made myself uncharacteristically useful when , the following morning , the three of us went home			1
you see , i was the one who worked out how to fasten the darn babyseat into the front seat of our elderly @entity168 estate car			0
ok , it took me ten minutes to work it out but at least , like @entity75 with @entity172 , i did it ! we lived at that point in a small cottage on a wooded hillside near @entity178 , @entity179 , reached only by a steep footpath			0
for @entity0 and @entity2 , home is the rather better - appointed @entity182 , an elegant , @entity184 spread on the @entity186 estate			1
will @entity0 need to carry the new - born bundle and its baby clobber ( nappy bags , push chair , cot , toys , etc ) down the garden path , as i did ? one suspects there may be staff to do that			1
once the newborn has been brought home , what is there for the father to do ? feeding the bairn ? my wife opted for breast - feeding			1
my man boobs may be corkers in their own right but they were never up to that task , so i had little to do			0
some women go in for breast pumps and decanting their milk into bottles , which the dads can then administer , but that all sounded a bit complicated to us — to be honest , it made me feel a bit faint			0
at @entity84 , there will surely be cohorts of nurses and @entity222 - trained nannies on hand to take over from @entity2 when she tires of feeding the little one			1
my mother - in - law , who had been my wife ’s birthing partner , was busy and helpful in the first days after the babies arrived			0
ah , the mother - in - law			0
we touch here , perhaps , on terrain that will be familiar to @entity0 , whose own ma - in - law , the indomitable @entity234 , is said to be in the @entity236 league of fast bowlers			1
' once the newborn has been brought home , what is there for the father to do ? ' asks @entity42 mrs @entity234 , one is told , will be on hand at @entity182 , once the young royals return to the family pile			1
when one hears of the proximity of mothers - in - law and gormless , bumbling sons - in - law , one fears a conflagration may break out as easily as if @entity252 and @entity253 jets are in close proximity in the skies over north - eastern @entity256			0
a man may love his wife ’s mother , and that affection may even sometimes be reciprocated , but that is not to say it is a good idea for him to try to disagree with her when it comes to theories about how to hold a baby , lay it in its cot or bring up wind			1
burping procedures : is this what search - and - rescue helicopter pilot @entity0 was put on earth to do ? mrs @entity234 may not be a member of the blood royal but i suspect that if it came to a shoot - out between her and @entity0 over babysitting niceties , she would take the bout with ease			1
for this is what a man learns while on paternity leave : he is there on sufferance			1
the early weeks of motherhood lean heavily to the distaff side			1
in july 1997 , your correspondent stood there , like any man , feeling a spare part as the aunts and grandmothers and godmothers and female neighbours fell to their cooing and gurgling at the purple - faced infant			0
worse , these women were keen to discuss the complete biological aspects of the delivery			0
the expression ‘ give us all the gory details ’ rings still in my ear as my wife ’s girlfriends descended on her with presents of @entity312 and ‘ moisturiser for your stretch marks ’			0
' those first weeks after a birth , a mother and babe spend much of their time resting and sleeping			2
if a man can go and earn a few bob to help pay the flurry of bills , is he not better thus employed ? ' descriptions of shrieking agony in the delivery room unfolded , complete with dante-esque accounts of pushing and dilation and heads appearing			0
worst of all , they wanted to know about ‘ tearing ’			0
a paternity - leave dad such as prince @entity0 has two options : he can stand in the margins of such covens , and possibly disgrace himself by fainting , floored by the nausea of envisaging post-natal undercarriage surgery ; or he can step into the garden ( better still a beer garden ) for some fresh air			1
i lasted less than a week first time round			0
for the second and third children , i made admiring noises , told my wife how wonderful she was , took a vague squint at the infant , then returned to my work			0
those first weeks after a birth , a mother and babe spend much of their time resting and sleeping			2
if a man can go and earn a few bob to help pay the flurry of bills , is he not better thus employed ? you can do a lot in six weeks			2
if you are a sailor you can cross the @entity360 and have time for a few days on some @entity363 beach			0
if you are a cyclist you can go from @entity365 to @entity366 and quite a long way back , depending on the gravity of your jock rot			0
by mid-june , early spuds will be ready for digging in our kitchen gardens			0
the new @entity373 will be up and running			0
@entity374 will be in summer garden - party season			0
@entity377 ’s cricketers may already be two down in the series against @entity380			0
prince @entity0 , sir , ignore your press officers and image advisers			1
do n’t fall for this notion that a new dad ’s place is at the ( stately ) home			0
you will have a whole life ahead for bonding with your lovely new child			0
stay just long enough to show affectionate interest			0
then make your escape !			0
