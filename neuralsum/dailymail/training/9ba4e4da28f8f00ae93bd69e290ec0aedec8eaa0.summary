by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity2 plans to allow voters to sack their mps were today dismissed as ' worse than meaningless '			1
the long - awaited bill to allow mps to be ' recalled ' by constituents was announced in the @entity8			1
it will give constituents the opportunity to sign a petition demanding a by - election if an mp is jailed - or if the @entity14 ' resolves that an mp should face a recall petition '			1
deputy prime minister , walking with @entity20 's shadow culture secretary @entity19 in @entity21 today , has watered down proposals to give voters the power to sack mps but the proposals were slammed by @entity28 backbencher @entity27 , who said @entity25 should not have a role in deciding whether or not they should face a petition to be sacked			1
he said : ' recall is about empowering people to hold their mps to account at all times , that 's all it is			1
' it 's a very simple mechanism that happens all over the world			2
what this bill will do is that it gives that power to a committee of parliamentarians , of @entity25 - the same committee , by the way , that got into trouble over @entity46			2
' mr @entity27 warned that the measures would leave voters with ' no more power after this bill goes through than they do today ' , and predicted an ' immense ' backlash			2
he added : ' it 's worse than meaningless , it 's a pretense , and voters will know it 's a pretense at the very first scandal			2
' he insisted he was still ' pleased ' that there will be a recall bill going through @entity21			2
@entity28 mp @entity27 has led a campaign to introduce the power of recall			1
he wants voters to be given the power to spark a by - election if they want to get rid of their member of @entity21 but he added : ' the criteria are so narrow that it 's virtually meaningless , it would be impossible to recall anyone			1
' so the danger of this - and it really is a danger , particularly on the back of this huge @entity72 vote we saw last week - is that people will discover at the very first scandal that they have been duped , that they have no more power after this bill goes through than they do today , and i think the backlash will be immense			1
former @entity20 mp @entity80 was jailed for six months last year after he was caught fiddling his expenses by more than £ 12,000 ' it 's worse than meaningless , it 's a pretense , and voters will know it 's a pretense at the very first scandal ... that 's the politest word i can possibly think of , it 's a pretense , that 's what it is			0
' @entity92 meanwhile said it was an ' embarrassingly weak ' proposal			0
the group 's chief executive @entity94 said : " this stitch - up will do nothing to restore the trust of voters in politics			1
it will centralise more power in @entity103 , rather than handing it to voters			0
' @entity106 , director of @entity107 , added : ' these recall proposals are symbolic of the government ’s attitude to democratic reform			0
' they say they want to give power back to the people but never quite manage to manage to follow through			0
the power to recall an elected representative between elections is an essential mechanism for democratic accountability			0
' recall enjoyed cross-party support and featured in every party manifesto			0
why are the government afraid of giving voters their say ? ' genuine recall empowers voters not parliamentary committees			0
at the moment when there is a scandal political parties can have a say , they can withdraw the whip from the mp , @entity21 can have a say through the @entity138 but voters are left out in the cold			0
' the government ’s watered down version of recall risks creating the illusion that people will have a say in recalling their elected representative while ensuring that this will probably never happen in practice			1
there is a real danger that this could alienate people from politics and politicians even further			0

watered - down ' right to recall ' *included* in the @entity156 's *speech* today
constituents can demand by - election but only if @entity161 agrees it is fair
@entity28 mps attack the proposal as a con which will only anger the public
