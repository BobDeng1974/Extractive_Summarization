there were reasons beyond the 211 runs he scored in @entity4 last month that convinced @entity5 he was back			1
there was his success in batting all day in the blistering heat during that unbeaten innings in @entity11			2
and the fact he was unfazed by the short ball that was seen as his @entity15 after his sudden exit from the last @entity19 tour			1
but , more important to @entity5 and the reason why he now hopes to return to the @entity22 side as an opening batsman alongside @entity24 , was how he felt in himself			1
@entity5 ( centre ) performed admirably for the @entity26 in @entity4 last month captain @entity5 relaxes during @entity26 training at @entity28 in @entity29 back in january he was so calm and composed ; a result , in his words , of being a ‘ more rounded person ’ than ever before			1
‘ on and off the pitch , ’ he says			2
this feeling of contentment , this renewed confidence , is something that has come from working through the anxiety issues he endured before he started working with dr @entity40 last year			1
and on friday , after a brilliant tour of @entity4 as captain of the @entity26 , @entity5 thinks he can return to his very best			1
that would be something when it was only in 2011 that he was named @entity45			1
but the 33 - year - old is oozing positivity and enjoying cricket in a way that was not always possible in the past			1
‘ i already felt i was well on the way back when i was playing for @entity52 in the summer , ’ he says			2
‘ but when i batted a whole day in @entity11 , where it was probably 42 degrees in the middle , it felt like a good achievement			2
‘ it was a good checkpoint for myself , and the selectors and coaches			2
and i was pleased because that ’s what you train for			2
to be able to do that was very satisfying			0
’ @entity65 's @entity64 celebrates taking wicket of @entity5 during the 2013 @entity19 series @entity5 returned home soon after that first @entity69 in @entity70 due to his anxiety issues it was satisfying because it was proof that he was right to back himself when so many feared he would never return to first - class cricket — when even he feared his career might be over when he took a second break away from the game last year			1
‘ i ’m pleased that the hard work has paid off , because i had to work hard to get back , ’ @entity5 adds			1
‘ @entity4 has shown that my belief is not unfounded ; that i can still do well , wherever it is in the order for the full @entity22 side			1
’ before he left that @entity19 tour he was secure batting at @entity83			1
now , however , the slot alongside @entity24 is where he might be required when @entity22 head to the @entity87 next month			1
‘ i played at @entity88 in my first test and was happy there , but was then moved to @entity83 , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve always been happy to do what i am asked to do , and i ’d be more than happy to open			0
‘ i ’d love to play in the @entity89 and one - dayers in the @entity87			1
‘ it ’s the next step for me			0
my thought process when i was playing second - team cricket at @entity52 was the need to earn a place in the first team			1
now i ’m back on the @entity26 team and my focus has been to try to earn a place in the @entity22 team			1
i ’m not saying i ’ve done that , but i ’ve put a pretty good case forward			0
@entity5 hopes to return to the @entity22 side as an opening batsman alongside @entity24 ( above ) ‘ i feel good			1
i ’m clear in my head , if i get the chance to play for @entity22 again , how i ’d play and how i ’d approach it			1
i think i ’d be right back to my best , because i feel a more rounded person than when i played for @entity22 before			1
‘ on and off the field i ’m a better person , in the way i handle stuff			0
’ @entity5 handled all aspects of the @entity26 tour well			1
from captaincy to the challenges he faced			0
‘ i really enjoyed it , ’ he says			0
‘ captaining was a new challenge , which was nice			0
it was important i threw myself into the tour			2
‘ the @entity26 is a window of opportunity for players to get into the full @entity22 side and be ready for @entity89			1
it was important i treated it like a full @entity89 tour because it was exactly what i needed			2
they offered me the captaincy but they also asked me if i ’d prefer to concentrate on my batting on my first tour back			2
‘ but it had already dawned on me that i might be asked when i looked at the squad and the ages of the players , so i ’d thought about it already			0
and i told them i really wanted to do it , even if i did have more in common with the coaches than some of the lads i was playing with			0
i was the oldest guy there by quite a few years ! ‘ but it was good			0
and it was nice seeing these young guys ; all so excited about their careers , some of them making the kind of mistakes i used to make			0
@entity5 has worked closely with dr @entity40 ( above ) , who has helped him employ a new approach to batting ‘ but these guys are 23 and a lot further down the line than i was at their age			1
the future ’s looking bright for @entity22			1
’ his work with @entity40 has enabled @entity5 to employ a new approach to his batting			1
‘ they tried the short ball in @entity4 , ’ he says			1
‘ i was expecting it and i actually do n’t mind it			0
as a batsman it gives you the opportunity to get your eye in because they ’re not really trying to get you out			2
‘ it also makes the ball a lot softer when they are banging it into the wicket , so it can work for me in a couple of ways			0
‘ but it was an opportunity to work on my all - round game			2
and recognise the fact that this is where i ’d get stuck in the past , trying to attack people ’s perceptions of me , trying to please everybody , rather than simply playing to my strengths			0
‘ i ’d try and play all over the wicket when most players do n’t			0
‘ most players focus on the areas where they are strongest			0
that is what makes them successful			0
‘ it ’s about sticking to your gameplan			0
a footballer who ca n’t dribble does n’t try to run with the ball through the opposition			0
he sticks to his strengths			0
it was not doing that where i came up short in the past , and where i ’m now better			0
’ so what about @entity19 this summer ? ‘ i ’ve not been selected for the next tour yet , ’ he says			1
‘ but i can only take it one series at a time			2
if i get selected for the @entity87 , then great			0
if i do n’t , then i ’ll keep working			2
but i ’m a good team man			0
’ @entity5 is back in @entity65 now , working in the media at the @entity196			1
‘ i just want to see if i like it and if i ’m any good at it , ’ he says			0
he thinks it might be something for the future			0
but not until he ’s done playing the game he has grown to love again .			0
