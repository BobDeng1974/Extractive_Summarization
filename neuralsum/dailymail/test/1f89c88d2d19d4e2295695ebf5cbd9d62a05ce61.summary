following criticism for spending £ 22.5million pursuing animal welfare prosecutions last year , the @entity0 is now reviewing its policy on fox hunting cases			1
the @entity0 is considering abandoning its controversial policy of ' pursuing pointless fox hunting prosecutions ' after the collapse of the latest case ( file picture of the @entity20 hunt in @entity21 , @entity22 ) the @entity0 has the power to bring its own prosecutions rather than rely on the police or the @entity26 ( @entity26 )			1
however last october , a report commissioned by the charity recommended abandoning the policy and leaving the job to the @entity26 , which has more expertise			2
the organisation stressed that its main role is to focus on the rescue , rehabilitation and rehoming of animals , rather than taking people to court			0
a spokesman said : ' one of the questions we are currently looking into it whether or not we continue to prosecute under the @entity7			0
' @entity46 hunting was outlawed in 2005 under @entity48 's government , but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting , usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of a fox across fields and woodlands			1
other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out the animals from woodland which can then be shot			0
there were more than 400 prosecutions under the controversial @entity7 between 2009 and 2013			0
just 49 people were charged with hunting offences in 2005 , but this more than doubled to 110 by 2010			2
the animal charity has no more legal actions left under the @entity7 after its decision last month to drop the case against @entity10 , joint master of the renowned @entity11 ( pictured ) in @entity12 @entity46 hunting with dogs was outlawed in 2005 under @entity48 's government , but groups continue to meet by using trail hunting ( file picture ) however critics claim many of these people are prosecuted under the @entity7 for poaching offences , rather than fox hunting , and that hardly any are from official hunts			1
in 2012 , the @entity0 spent £ 327,000 prosecuting the @entity80 , in @entity81			1
@entity82 has ridden with the hunt			0
three defendants were accused of interfering with a badger sett while assisting the @entity86 in february 2012			0
a year later the @entity0 admitted it did not have enough evidence			2
defendants ’ costs of up to £ 10,000 paid by the taxpayer			0
in april 2013 , charity accused two defendants in the @entity93 of disturbing a badger sett but ten months later offered ‘ no evidence ’			0
in november 2013 , case against @entity97 , 33 , of the @entity98 , near @entity99 in @entity100 , was dropped due to insufficient evidence			2
last month mr @entity10 's case collapsed after the @entity0 pulled out of a three - year battle to prove he had broken hunting laws			1
his solicitor , @entity106 , claimed that the case had been flawed from the start			0
he said : ' there is video footage of my client laying legal trails before and after the alleged breach of the hunting ban which was not disclosed to us by the @entity0			2
' he said the laying of a trail , or a scent which the hounds can track rather than chasing a live animal , showed that the @entity11 had behaved responsibly , not recklessly as the prosecution claimed			0
@entity124 , from the @entity125 , said : ' we would welcome any decision by the @entity0 to leave the question of prosecuting hunts to the police and the @entity26			2
' @entity131 has always faced a fundamental difficulty acting as a prosecutor while also being a political campaigning organisation			0
it can only be in the best interests of animal welfare that the @entity0 returns to its core principles rather than pursuing pointless prosecutions through the courts			1
' an @entity0 spokesman said : ' whilst we have not changed our policy on prosecuting alleged offences under the @entity7 we do n't have any other hunt cases pending at the moment			1
