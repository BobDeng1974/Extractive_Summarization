by @entity0 thanks to three school - aged children and a messy husband , suddenly my life seems to have become all about laundry			1
our au pair recently left , so , for the first time , i ’m having to tackle the mounds of dirty clothes by myself			1
but , despite my best efforts , everything looks grubby and stained			1
so what to do ? i turned to the internet and found countless women swapping imaginative , and sometimes bizarre , laundry tips			1
i decided to compile a selection and put them to the test			2
laundry guru @entity33 , who runs his own professional washing firm , gave his verdicts on which ones work and which ideas just do n’t wash			1
just the tonic ? vodka has some benefit in removing stains the claim : you can freshen up clothes by spraying them with vodka			1
the theory is the alcohol works in much the same way as sanitising hand gels and kills odour - causing bacteria			2
does it work ? as the children ’s sports day approaches , i realise most of my summer dresses smell musty thanks to them hiding in the wardrobe all winter			1
i choose one i ’m not too fond of — just in case this experiment goes horribly wrong — hunt down a water pistol and spray the dress from top to bottom with neat vodka			2
initially , it reeks of booze , though i suppose it masks the musty smell			2
i hang it over a door and return an hour later			2
it smells much fresher — but this may be in part because it has been hanging outside the wardrobe			2
i would be wary of doing this on delicate material			2
@entity82 ’s verdict : vodka has some benefit in removing stains because it penetrates grease very slightly , but it may affect colour on delicate fabrics such as silk			1
you ’re better off using something like @entity92 , which chemically neutralises the odour and is proven to work			1
the claim : pour white vinegar into the washer drawer and run through your empty machine on a hot wash to get rid of bacteria and limescale			2
does it work ? i am a bit wary about this			1
i pour about half a cup of white wine vinegar into the washer drawer , which is black with mould , and then run the machine for an hour at 60 degrees			2
the door is much cleaner - looking and the machine has lost its slightly fusty smell			2
@entity82 ’s verdict : white wine vinegar is a good cleaning agent and will have a positive effect on bacteria and limescale build - up			1
run the machine empty on the hottest wash once a month , with or without the vinegar , to help keep it clean and fresh			2
cleaning the cleaner : it 's vitally important to keep your tumble dryer clean the claim : vacuuming the inside of your tumble dryer will get rid of lint — little bits of fibre that are released from the fabric as it dries and end up as grey fluff			1
@entity135 bungs up your tumble dryer and will leave fluff on your clothes			1
does it work ? when i look into our tumble dryer i am appalled at the build up of lint around the door			1
i have a nifty little hand - held @entity145 vacuum which i use to remove as much as possible and then wipe away the remainder with a clean dry cloth			2
there was so much , i could have knitted a fluffy grey jumper with it			2
@entity82 ’s verdict : this is vitally important			1
too much lint blocks the tumble dryer , reduces air flow and , therefore , reduces efficiency			2
less air means that garments take longer to dry and so become worn - looking more rapidly			2
remove the lint with your hand after every cycle , and give your tumble dryer a really good vacuum once a month			2
the claim : use instant coffee to dye faded jeans black again			2
the natural dyes in the coffee will make them look as good as new			0
some purists make dye from coffee grounds and use buckets to soak it in ; others recommend chucking a cup of coffee into the washing machine , though they do n’t specify whether it ought to be straight into the drum or powder drawer			1
does it work ? my favourite jeans ever are by @entity185 and were bought circa 1999			1
while they ’re still going strong , you would never know they had once been black			0
i put them into the machine and throw a cup of very strong instant coffee into the drum			0
amazingly , they emerge looking at least five shades darker			0
and , no , they do n’t smell like i ’ve spilt my @entity197 down them			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : this really does work , as coffee contains tannin which will dye the fabric			1
but i think you ’d need buckets of coffee to get a really good result			0
you might be better off drinking it and investing in a specific clothes dye			1
@entity211 bedding : tennis balls in your tumble dryer help to transfer heat to the middle of duvets and pillow cases the claim : washing duvets and pillows can leave the filling flat , but popping them in your tumble dryer with a couple of tennis balls apparently rejuvenates them			1
does it work ? having never actually washed a duvet , i am first forced to do so in order that i can draw a comparison			1
so i am able to confirm that , yes , adding the tennis balls do make a great deal of difference			0
my duvet is gorgeously thick and soft when it comes out			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : this is fantastic			1
usually the shell of the duvet dries , but not the inside			0
the tennis balls in your tumble dryer help transfer heat into the middle of the duvet and , together with the tumbling action , results in fluffy bedding			0
the claim : you do n’t have to dry - clean silk			0
instead , hand - wash it using ordinary powder , dry till damp , then pop it in the freezer to kill germs and loosen grease			0
when it ’s frozen , just iron it , then hang it up again			0
does it work ? my beautiful cream silk @entity257 acquired a green stain at a party five years ago and i have been too idle to take it to the dry cleaners			1
i carefully wash it in my normal @entity264 , lie it flat to dry , then pop it into the freezer on top of a family - size box of fish fingers			0
not so n - ice : your freezer is never going to be as good as a dry cleaner when i remove it two hours later , the scarf is stiff with ice and cracks ominously			0
nervously , i gently iron it on the silk setting			0
but not only is the stain still there , the scarf actually looks less clean than it did before — placing it on the coloured cardboard of the fish finger box perhaps was n’t the best idea , as it ’s transferred some ink on to the material — and the expensive sheen is completely gone			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : sorry , but your freezer is never going to be as good as your dry - cleaner			1
the surface of silk may look powdery if you wash it too aggressively because the surface fibre breaks up very slightly			0
@entity297 is also not colour - fast			0
this means that the dye is n’t very well chemically bonded to the fibre and may come out			0
the claim : adding two tablespoons of table salt to the drawer of the washing machine will brighten colours as salt chemically reacts with detergent and makes it more powerful			1
it will also ‘ exfoliate ’ stains away			0
does it work ? i pop in some @entity313 table salt along with a couple of my five - year - old daughter ’s once luridly neon dresses , which are now a grubby off - yellow			1
after a 40c wash they look slightly brighter , but not eye - wateringly so			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : this will have some effect as table salt does react with detergent			1
however , two tablespoons wo n’t make much difference — you could try four			0
certain delicate fabrics such as silk and wool will be destroyed by this , but it ’s worth a go on cotton			0
milk magic : milk only slightly fades @entity337 stains the claim : milk gets @entity337 off clothes , possibly because of the lactic acid it contains			1
does it work ? my nine - year - old has just been given a ‘ pen licence ’ at school			1
in theory , this means that he is able to write neatly ; in practice , everything is stained with @entity337			0
it is almost the end of the school year , so i am not paying much attention to how pristine the children ’s uniform looks			1
nonetheless , i take a white vest that is stained with blue ink and soak it in some semi-skimmed @entity362 milk			0
an hour later i rinse it			0
the @entity337 smudge fades slightly but does n’t disappear			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : @entity337 is one of the hardest things to get out			1
specialist stain remover is probably going to be more effective than relying on the small amount of lactic acid in milk			0
the claim : soak greying whites in hot water into which you ’ve dissolved five aspirin tablets			0
does it work ? my five - year - old ’s new white socks are completely grey within a week			1
i dissolve five @entity379 into a bowl and leave the socks for two hours			0
the water is filthy but the socks remain determinedly grey			0
@entity82 ’s verdict : @entity384 contains salicylic acid , which might act like a bleach			1
however , this is such a negligible amount that nothing is likely to happen			0
five hundred pills might have some effect ! for whites , i ’d recommend using detergents with optical brightening agents			0
these reflect uv light as white light so that clothes look lighter			1
whitening products also contain colour - safe bleaching agents .			0
