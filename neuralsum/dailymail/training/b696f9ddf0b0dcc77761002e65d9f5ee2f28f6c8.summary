the scout who recruited @entity1 and then left @entity2 ‘ by mutual consent ’ last month amid concerns that the club ’s record signing had proved something of a flop , was feeling more than a little vindicated on saturday			1
‘ ahem , ’ tweeted @entity9 — and understandably so , seeing as the @entity10 has now scored four goals in three games			2
clearly , all @entity13 needed was a manager capable of utilising the talent that persuaded @entity2 to pay £ 10million for him in the first place			1
and while @entity24 admits a decent enough offer might well have led to @entity1 ’s departure had @entity27 been signed in the last transfer window , the fact that the striker is now performing as effectively as he is amounts to a triumph for both player and manager			1
@entity13 marked his second of this @entity31 tie with a celebratory somersault , having demonstrated his athleticism with the power he generated from the header moments earlier			1
@entity2 striker @entity1 celebrates his opener for the @entity2 after 20 minutes against @entity38 at the @entity39 @entity41 's cross is met by @entity1 , who tapped in his third goal in as many games as the home side took the lead on saturday @entity2 midfielder @entity46 pumps his fist in celebration having scored a scorcher from long range at the @entity39 @entity10 striker @entity1 made it 3 - 0 early in the second - half with this header , which was his fourth goal in three games for the @entity2 @entity56 under 21 striker @entity55 runs away to celebrate having fired in @entity2 's fourth goal on saturday in the @entity31 @entity2 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity58 7 ; @entity41 7 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 7.5 , @entity61 7.5 ; @entity62 7 ( @entity63 78 , 6 ) , @entity64 7 , @entity46 8 , @entity65 7.5 ( @entity66 90 ) ; @entity13 8.5 ( @entity67 86 ) , @entity55 7.5 subs not used : wisdom , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 scorers : @entity13 20 and 57 , @entity46 42 , @entity55 72 manager : @entity24 8 @entity38 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity75 6 ; @entity76 5 , @entity77 5 , @entity78 5 , @entity79 5 ; song 4 ( @entity81 68 , 5 ) , @entity85 5.5 , @entity82 4 ( @entity83 60 , 1 ) , @entity84 5 ; @entity86 4 , @entity87 5 ( @entity27 68 , 5 ) subs not used : @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 booked : @entity94 red card manager : @entity96 5 referee : @entity98 7 @entity99 : @entity13 compared to a quite stunning first - half goal from @entity46 , not to mention a fine finish from @entity55 after the break , @entity1 ’s 20th - minute strike was not much to look at			1
it was a poacher ’s goal that owed far more to @entity41 and the quality of his cross as well as his success in winning an aerial challenge with @entity110			2
indeed , @entity13 might have been a fraction offside when he diverted @entity41 ’s delivery past @entity75 from close range			2
the assistant referee saw nothing wrong with it but @entity96 did — and complained			0
in fairness to a side now boasting just one defeat in nine since @entity24 took charge , it was no less than @entity2 deserved			1
set up to be aggressive by their manager , they attacked @entity38 with real vigour to produce arguably their finest performance of the season			0
the travelling fans would probably rate this as @entity38 ’s worst			0
they booed their captain @entity82 and they hurled abuse at @entity96 , not for the first time telling him to ‘ * * * * off ’			2
exactly why they display such animosity towards a manager who , for the most part , has done a good job at @entity138 is baffling			0
but this was a rough afternoon for @entity96 , made all the more uncomfortable by the dismissal of @entity83 and the reaction of @entity38 ’s owners			1
while @entity144 is said to have left early , @entity143 took to @entity145 to express his sympathy for the fans			0
@entity96 also said they were entitled to feel frustrated when this competition was one they hoped to advance further in			0
but he also defended his players ‘ to the hilt ’ , arguing that fatigue undermined their hopes of progressing after three games in six days			0
not to mention that final spell against @entity157 on wednesday with nine men			0
‘ it ’s a game too far for us , ’ he said			0
‘ the fixture list did n’t give us the right opportunity to come here and play better			0
the players were dead on their feet			0
’ asked specifically about the personal abuse , he said : ‘ i ca n’t afford to get disappointed on things like that			0
’ further weakened by the loss of @entity172 to injury , @entity96 ’s side offered little in response to @entity2 ’s ambition ; not a single effort on target in an opening half and not much of note in the second other than the dismissal			1
@entity83 of @entity38 ( centre ) and @entity61 ( left ) square up after a challenge during the second - half at the @entity39 @entity83 strikes @entity61 in the face during the second - half at the @entity39 in full view of referee @entity98 @entity83 gives referee @entity98 no choice , having raised his arm into @entity61 's face , to send off the @entity38 substitute @entity2 manager @entity24 is all smiles before kick - off at the @entity39 as he hoped to guide his side into the @entity31 last eight @entity76 of @entity38 clears the ball under pressure from @entity2 forward @entity62 in their @entity31 clash @entity65 's first - half strike clattered off the post as the hosts dominated proceedings to lead 2 - 0 at the break @entity83 had been on the pitch as a replacement for @entity82 for less than 10 minutes when a nasty challenge on @entity61 invited @entity98 to show him a yellow card , before a shove in the face of the @entity2 captain prompted a straight red			1
@entity96 said : ‘ it ’s unprofessional , is n’t it ? ‘ the punishment is laid down in our code of conduct in terms of hands and getting sent off for something like that			0
that will be dealt with , as always , internally and we move on			0
but we ’re so short of bodies it ’s the last thing we need			0
’ @entity2 , by contrast , were both composed and excellent here			1
this is a @entity225 team , after all			0
but they were dynamic , determined , every inch a team desperate to secure a place in the quarter - finals			1
they too were playing their third game in six days but there were no heavy legs in the home side			2
@entity1 displayed that sharpness to open the scoring and @entity46 did well to ride a challenge from @entity239 before beating @entity75 with a terrific 25 - yard strike just before half - time			1
@entity13 ’s second came in the 57th minute when he produced a tremendous amount of power from a deflected @entity62 cross			1
and to compound @entity38 ’s misery , a 72nd - minute goal from @entity55 would then follow , beating @entity75 at his near post			1
as thrilled as @entity24 was , he stressed the need to remain focused on @entity250 points			2
and @entity1 ? ‘ the difference is confidence , ’ he said			2
@entity55 ( left ) attempts to shield possession from @entity78 and @entity255 at the @entity39 in the @entity31 fifth - round @entity2 midfielder doubled the hosts ' lead late in the first - half with this sublime long - range strike for @entity24 ' side @entity1 is joined by @entity2 team - mates @entity55 ( centre ) and @entity41 as they cruised to a comprehensive victory @entity38 manager @entity96 ( right ) ca n't hide his frustration as his side suffered a heavy defeat at the @entity39 @entity1 is evidently delighted having added his second of the afternoon as @entity2 reached the @entity31 quarter - finals @entity38 's @entity65 contests for the ball with @entity2 's @entity65 during the @entity31 fifth - round match on saturday @entity24 erupts in celebration as his @entity2 side emphatically beat @entity38 4 - 0 in the @entity31 fifth - round on saturday @entity1 was clearly head over heals with joy having found his scoring boots for @entity2 , that 's four goals in his last three games click here for all the graphics , stats and heat maps from the @entity31 clash at the @entity39 , including @entity1 's second goal ( below )			1

@entity1 scored his fourth in three matches for @entity2 to open the scoring after 20 minutes
@entity2 's @entity46 doubled the @entity2 ' lead with a fine long range strike for a 2 - 0 lead at the break
@entity1 scored his second with a deflected header in the 57th minute to make the advantage 3 - 0 at the @entity39
@entity83 received a straight red card before @entity55 added a fourth for @entity24 ' side
@entity2 progress to the @entity31 quarter - finals for the first time since 2008
