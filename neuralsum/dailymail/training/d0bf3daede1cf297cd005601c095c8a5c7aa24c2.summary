@entity0 is determined to prove @entity1 are a match for the @entity5 's best after securing a ' massive ' victory against @entity4			1
@entity1 ' astonishing start to the campaign recently came to a shuddering halt , with the embarrassing midweek @entity9 exit to third - tier @entity10 making it five successive defeats in all competitions			1
it would not have been a surprise if the club 's worst losing streak of the 21st century had continued on saturday given the string of injuries and suspensions they had to contend with against @entity4			0
@entity0 celebrates as his attempt at goal was deflected in by @entity25 however , @entity27 's side rallied impressively and ran out comprehensive 3 - 0 winners at @entity29 's , where efforts from @entity31 and @entity32 added to @entity25 's first - half own goal			1
' it 's massive after the results that we 've been having , ' @entity1 captain @entity0 said			0
' not so much the performances , because i thought that we deserved more in a couple of games , but the fact is we had zero points in four games			0
' so , to have a performance like we had , and get the clean sheet - three points , three goals - just puts us on the right track to go on a good run again			0
' @entity0 congratulates @entity31 as @entity1 returned to winning was against @entity4 the win had extra importance as it was @entity1 's first point , never mind all three , against a team that finished above them last season			1
defeats to @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 fed those suggesting that @entity1 could not cut it against the top teams and were only flying high due to a kind fixture schedule			0
the win against @entity4 , who finished fifth last term , is therefore an important marker , especially with home matches against @entity69 and @entity58 following the @entity70 to @entity71			1
@entity1 manager @entity27 saw his side return to winning ways after five defeats in a row ' they are great games , again , ' @entity0 , suspended for the trip to old haunt @entity77 , said			2
' once and for all i think we have to prove we can compete against these big teams ' we 'll prepare ourselves first for @entity71 - that 's the most important - and then we 'll think about the others , but we want to prove we 're at the same level			2
' saints certainly looked back to their early - season form against @entity4 , who welcome @entity89 to @entity90 on @entity70 - a match in which @entity91 knows the players need to make amends			1
' fortunately for us the games are going to come thick and fast now , ' he told evertontv			0
' we 've got the chance to rectify it in less than a week which is good			0
' then after that we have two more games in the space of a week so we will definitely be ready for @entity71 on @entity70 where hopefully we can change the result from saturday and push on			2

@entity1 beat @entity4 3 - 0 at @entity29 's after give defeats in a row
the @entity1 remain fifth in the @entity5 table after the win
@entity1 face @entity71 on @entity70 and then host @entity69
