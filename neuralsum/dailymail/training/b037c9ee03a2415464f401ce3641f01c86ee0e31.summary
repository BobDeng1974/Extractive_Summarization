as @entity1 basked in the match - winning batting of @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity6 , it was easy to forget that the platform for their run - chase had been laid the day before by @entity10			1
his spell of five for 19 in 2.5 overs at the end of the @entity15 innings on wednesday had limited the hosts to 239 – a target @entity1 knocked off with five balls to spare to close the gap in this seven - match series to 3 - 2			1
on saturday they have the chance to draw level			2
@entity10 finished with six for 48 , and now possesses two of the three six - wicket hauls in @entity1 ’s one - day history			1
but his contribution goes beyond the record books : as much as anything , he embodies the spirit of a team that , against the odds , is beginning to believe in itself			0
@entity10 poses for a portrait after his superb bowling display for @entity1 in the fifth odi the @entity37 seamer acknowledges taking his fifth wicket on wednesday @entity1 's six - wicket hauls in @entity40 : @entity10 6 - 45 vs @entity41 2011 @entity42 6 - 47 vs @entity43 2014 @entity44 6 - 31 vs @entity45 2005 @entity1 ’s one - day side still has its problems , of course , and defeat on saturday would add yet another series loss to the ledger			1
but there are reasons for optimism too			0
@entity55 has confirmed his explosive potential as an opener , @entity5 has slotted in expertly at @entity58 , and @entity4 has now made three match - winning hundreds this year alone			2
@entity60 finished off the run - chase in @entity62 , while @entity63 has confirmed himself as the team ’s spin - bowling banker			2
@entity67 ’s control has improved as the series has gone on			2
the form of @entity70 , though , is as promising as anything			0
his 12 scalps at 19 apiece make him the leading wicket - taker in the series on either side , three clear of @entity15 spinner @entity77			1
the next - best seamer is @entity79 , on just six			0
@entity80 ’s @entity70 ’s new - ball partner , has collected only three			0
@entity70 bowls @entity77 in @entity6 to end the @entity15 innings on 239 , setting up the @entity1 win @entity70 jumps for joy after getting @entity85 in the fifth odi with @entity87 and @entity88 set to return from injury in time for the @entity90 , and @entity80 still capable of improvement , @entity1 are building a useful stock of seamers ahead of the tournament in @entity41 and @entity95 – so much so that someone may have to miss out			1
‘ it ’s always at the back of your mind , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ with @entity87 and @entity102 not being here it has given some of the guys , particularly myself , the opportunity to put our hand up and show the management and coaches what we can do			0
‘ it ’s been good for me , because i have been bowling in some tough conditions			0
it has been good experience , good exposure and the more you play at international level the better you get			0
’ back at @entity118 in august 2013 , @entity70 was winning his first @entity120 cap against @entity41			1
if @entity122 and @entity123 made him look a touch pedestrian , he has since added a yard of pace			1
it is a process he attributes to three coaches : @entity129 at @entity37 , @entity130 at the @entity131 in @entity132 , and @entity1 ’s own @entity133 , whom @entity10 credits with sorting out a ‘ slight technical issue ’ with his front arm			1
as if to underline the point , @entity10 played in the three tests @entity1 won against @entity138 in the summer			1
and if his figures were unremarkable – five wickets at 43 – then his endeavour deserved better			0
@entity10 said : ‘ i feel it was maybe a bit of a turning point			2
it has been nice to be on this tour and get a run of games and show people what i can do			0
’ more heroics on saturday and those people may need convincing no longer .			0

@entity10 is leading wicket taker in series with 12 at average on 19
@entity157 has added a yard of pace since his test debut vs @entity41 in 2013
@entity1 play @entity43 in sixth odi in @entity163 on saturday
@entity43 lead series 3 - 2 with two matches to play
