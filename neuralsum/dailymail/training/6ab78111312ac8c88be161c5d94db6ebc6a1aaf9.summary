it is said that the course of true love never did run smooth – a problem experienced by many users of the dating app tinder			0
it is currently easy to ‘ swipe left ’ and accidently reject a potential partner , without the ability to search and find them again			1
but this could be about to change with the roll - out of an ‘ undo ’ button , which @entity14 will use to monetise missed connections by launching a premium paid - for version			1
@entity14 ( screenshots pictured ) is rolling out an ' undo ' button which will let users undo swipes - letting them revisit profiles that they may have accidentally rejected			0
the function is due to be rolled out in the @entity25 and elsewhere , but will require a premium subscription to @entity27 , which could cost up to $ 20 ( £ 12.50 ) a month the current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘ like ’ someone and left to pass			1
if both users like each other , they can chat and share photos with each other			0
@entity14 sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day , with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. this is set to change , because now the company , which is based in @entity44 , @entity45 , plans on offering a premium subscription called @entity27 , which will first roll out in the @entity25 , @entity47 and @entity48			1
@entity14 has just rolled out a free function called ' matches ' ( pictured ) which allows users to share swipe - able photos with all of your matches at once ceo and president of @entity14 , @entity14 ( who will be leaving the firm as ceo ) told @entity59 : ‘ the most - requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on			1
’ a new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘ undo ’ button on the home screen , which members of @entity27 will be able to use , but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service			2
the app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called @entity80 , which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations			2
currently , the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user ’s location , whereas @entity27 users will be able to toggle between different locations			0
the new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations			0
while this feature may well be used by well - travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook - ups , the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life			0
mr @entity110 said : ‘ we often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they ’ve left to go on a trip or vacation … we also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and @entity27 can do better at that			0
’ there is no date when @entity27 will launch in the @entity25 and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance			2
@entity14 says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents ( 62p ) , $ 4.99 ( £ 3.10 ) , $ 9.99 ( £ 6.30 ) , or $ 19.99 ( £ 12.50 ) will be the best fit for consumers			1
‘ we want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on , ’ @entity110 said			0
@entity27 will be the premium version of the free @entity14 dating app. it will be rolled out in the @entity25 , @entity47 and @entity48 first on a trial basis			1
there is no set date for its launch , but in the beginning @entity14 will charge differing amounts for the service to find its ' sweet spot '			2
prices will range from 99cents ( 62p and £ 20 ( £ 12.50 ) , before a global rate is set			1
@entity27 will include an ' undo ' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left			1
a ' passport ' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations			0
currently , the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user ’s location , whereas @entity27 users will be able to toggle between different locations .			0
