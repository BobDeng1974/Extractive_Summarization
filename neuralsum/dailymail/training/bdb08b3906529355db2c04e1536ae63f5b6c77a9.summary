by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 20 april 2012 updated : 04:51 est , 20 april 2012 the parents of @entity2 have refused a ' self - serving ' request by their son 's killer to meet him ahead of a bond hearing today where is expected to plea for his release from jail			1
@entity11 and @entity12 have not ruled out meeting @entity13 in the future , but are wary of his motives at this time , their lawyer said			1
' there may be a time and place for that , but not now , ' said @entity20 , an assistant to family attorney @entity21 , in an emailed statement late yesterday			0
' question motives ' : the parents of shot teenager @entity2 , @entity11 ( left ) and @entity12 ( right ) , have refused to meet their son 's killer @entity13 ahead of his bond hearing confrontation : neighbourhood watch volunteer @entity13 ( left ) has been charged with the second - degree murder of 17 - year - old @entity2 ( right ) in @entity28 , @entity29 , in february			1
@entity13 claims it was self - defence ' we believe ( the ) @entity13 request is very self - serving , considering the timing of it 50 days later , right before his bond hearing			1
' he said that @entity13 has never apologized on his website or on voicemails that he left friends or expressed remorse during interviews with authorities			2
' with @entity13 now making this request , the family questions his motives and sincerity , ' he added			1
meanwhile , @entity2 's parents attended a town hall meeting at the @entity48 in @entity49 yesterday where they were offered condolences from a 400 - strong crowd over their loss			2
staying strong : @entity11 and @entity12 are offered support and condolences over the loss of their son by a 400 - strong crowd at a town hall meeting at the @entity48 in @entity49 yesterday comforted : @entity12 ( left ) gets a hug from a supporter			0
she and @entity2 's father @entity11 believe @entity13 's request for a meeting on the eve of his bond hearing is ' self - serving ' supported : @entity11 ( pictured ) says @entity13 has not once apologised or expressed remorse over the death of his son @entity2 they also heard from a panel of speakers who discussed the difficulties of prosecuting a case relating the ' stand - your - ground ' law			1
@entity13 admits shooting the 17 - year - old during a confrontation in february , but claims self - defence under the state law , which eliminates a person 's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious injury			1
legal experts say the neighborhood watch volunteer stands a good chance of being granted bail at today 's hearing despite being charged with the second - degree murder			1
whether @entity13 is allowed to leave the county as he awaits trial - and how he would remain safe - are two questions likely to be at the center of the hearing at the @entity97			1
' although it 's not routine for people charged with murder to get bond , they do get bond , and i think there is an excellent argument to be made in his specific case for him to be released on bond , ' said defense attorney @entity109 , who practices in @entity110 , about 15 miles northeast of @entity111			2
demanding justice : supporters outside the @entity114 , where the community and experts discussed the difficulties of prosecuting a case relating to the state 's ' @entity121 ' law @entity13 has several factors in his favor			1
for one , he has ties to the local community including family members who are expected to testify by telephone on his behalf at friday 's hearing			2
he turned himself in voluntarily after second - degree murder charges were filed against him last week , a good indication that he does n't pose a flight risk			2
he has never been convicted of a crime , which suggests that he does n't pose a threat to society , legal experts said			0
' it 's hard for a prosecutor to argue he will leave , when up to this point he has been cooperative and everyone knows who he is , ' said @entity142 , a veteran prosecutor in @entity143			0
a spokeswoman for special prosecutor @entity146 's office said she would n't comment on whether @entity147 would object to @entity13 being released on bond			1
@entity13 's safety weighed on the mind of his defense attorney right after he took on the case last week			1
@entity153 indicated he would ask that @entity13 be allowed to leave the area , if he is granted bond , because of those concerns			2
circuit judge @entity157 was assigned the case wednesday after a previous judge recused herself because of a potential conflict of interest			0
' normally , the conditions are that you stay local			0
i think that is going to be difficult , ' @entity153 said in an interview			0
' i think nobody would deny the fact that if @entity13 were walking down the street today , he would be at risk			1
' @entity153 has also said he would prefer that @entity13 be released so he can assist in building a defense case			2
the judge would have discretion to allow @entity13 to live elsewhere along with a number of restrictions such as a curfew , regular reporting requirement and possibly an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet , said @entity182 law professor @entity181			2
protest : a woman holds a sign outside the church yesterday as the community convened to discuss the case ' that would be the kind of low - cost agreement between @entity13 and the court that might make sense , so we 're not talking about police protection for an extended period of time , ' @entity188 said			1
@entity153 said he would ask for assistance from law enforcement			0
@entity199 , a spokeswoman for the @entity200 , said she could n't comment on what security procedures will be in place for @entity13 if he is released			2
the sheriff 's office does have the ability to monitor defendants outside the county if a judge requests a gps monitor to be used as a condition of release			0
' i want him to be safe , ' @entity153 said			0
' i want him to get to his trial so that a judge or jury , or the prosecutor and i , can figure out a way to resolve this			0
' calling for release : @entity13 's attorney @entity153 ( right ) , pictured at a court hearing last week , says he wants his client ( centre ) to be allowed out on bail so they can work together on a defense case there is only so much that law enforcement can do to help protect @entity13 , though , if he is released from jail , said @entity232 , a former @entity233 prosecutor who is now in private practice			1
' there is no mechanism in which a defendant is entitled to an around - the - clock detail , ' @entity232 said			0
' the irony is that the only safe place for him , considering the current atmosphere surrounding the case , is protective custody within the jail system			0
' jail inmates are separated from other inmates when there is a belief they could face threats			0
@entity13 has been in protective custody since he entered the @entity110 jail more than a week ago after turning himself into authorities			0
witnesses in cases involving violence or threats are frequently afforded protection , but police officers and prosecutors have no special responsibility to protect @entity13 once he is out of jail , said @entity262 , a @entity263 law professor and former public defender in @entity265			0
' if he gets out , the primary responsibility to protect @entity13 would be on @entity13 , ' @entity262 said			0
scene : the encounter which led to @entity2 's death took place on the secluded walkway on the right of this picture of a gated community in @entity275 , @entity29 @entity13 is charged with second - degree murder in the 17 - year - old @entity2 's death during a february 26 confrontation in a @entity275 , @entity29 , gated community			1
@entity2 was walking home from a convenience store when @entity13 spotted him from his truck and called police to report him as suspicious			0
@entity13 has claimed self - defense under @entity29 's ' stand - your - ground ' law , which eliminates a person 's duty to retreat under threat of death or serious injury			1
the lack of an arrest for 44 days spurred protests nationwide , several in @entity110 , in which participants chanted and held signs that said , ' @entity297 now ! ' anger over a delay in @entity13 's arrest led to the @entity275 police chief stepping down temporarily and the recusal of the prosecutor who normally handles cases out of @entity275			1
@entity275 city officials were holding a town hall meeting thursday to address some of the residual anger from the case			0
under typical bond conditions , @entity13 would likely have a curfew , be prohibited from contacting @entity2 's family and not be allowed to consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs			1
he also may be required to wear an electronic monitoring device , which he would most likely have to pay for			0
even if @entity13 is granted bond , his family may not be able to afford it , given that it generally can range from $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 for a second - degree murder charge			1
@entity13 's parents are retired , and their house in @entity322 , @entity29 , is valued at just under $ 120,000 , according to the @entity323			2
' they are not a family of means , so that is going to be difficult , ' @entity153 said .			0
