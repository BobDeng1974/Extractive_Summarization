@entity0 was under renewed pressure last night to tackle @entity2 over @entity4 ’s failure to release @entity6 inmate @entity5			1
in a bitter blow to campaigners fighting for the 48 - year - old , it emerged that the @entity11 has admitted that the last @entity13 resident at the notorious military camp is no nearer to freedom			2
last month the @entity4 president promised to ‘ prioritise ’ the father - of - four ’s case after the prime minister raised his plight during talks at the @entity23			1
@entity35 , co-ordinator of the @entity37 campaign , said : ‘ @entity0 must do more to insist that the @entity4 releases @entity38			2
‘ if he really cared at all , he would have secured @entity37 ’s freedom a long time ago			0
‘ it inevitably raises questions about whether @entity13 is not doing enough because it has actually got something to hide			2
’ @entity4 defence secretary @entity43 , who must give the final authority to transfer captives from the facility in @entity47 , has confirmed mr @entity5 ’s file had still not crossed his desk			1
challenged on whether he was still willing to sign off the release of @entity6 inmates , he dismayed mr @entity5 ’s supporters by telling reporters recently he had nothing pending in his in - tray			1
responding to claims he had one file ‘ on his desk ’ , he said : ‘ i do n’t know about one still on my desk , unless it ’s under my desk			2
as far as i know , i have made a decision on everything that is ready to be made a decision on			0
’ @entity4 defense secretary @entity43 , pictured , said he has not seen mr @entity5 's file to sign his release on saturday , mr @entity5 , who lived in @entity65 with his wife and four children , will have been held in @entity6 for exactly 13 years without charge or trial			1
he has twice been cleared for release – first by the @entity72 administration in 2007 and again by president @entity2 in 2009			1
@entity73 , the detainee ’s lawyer and director of human rights charity @entity76 , said : ‘ the admission that @entity38 ’s case is n’t even on @entity43 ’s desk suggests that @entity2 ’s claims to be prioritising it may be little more than weasel words			1
‘ if the @entity4 government wanted to prioritise invading a country , it could be done in a week			2
so sending one man home to his family in @entity65 can not be too much to ask			0
‘ coming just days after @entity0 personally requested that @entity38 be returned home to @entity13 , it does n’t say much for the state of the so - called special relationship			0
’ mr @entity73 added : ‘ the suspicion must be that the @entity4 fears he will reveal yet more about its shameful torture programme if he is ever allowed to speak freely			1
’ @entity97 mp @entity96 said : ‘ it is simply not good enough for the @entity11 to ignore decisions made by two @entity4 presidents			0
he should be released without further ado			0
’ the @entity4 administration has said it is ‘ aggressively pursuing the transfer ’ of @entity6 ’s remaining inmates			1
the number has plunged to 122 from a peak of 650 , and mr @entity2 has vowed to close the detention camp before the end of his term in office			0
@entity112 - born mr @entity5 moved to @entity65 almost 20 years ago and married , securing leave to remain in @entity13			1
in 2001 , he was detained in @entity115 after going to @entity116 to carry out peaceful voluntary work for an @entity119 charity , his representatives claim			0
his supporters allege he was then captured by bounty hunters , handed to the @entity4 military for $ 5,000 and tortured at a secret ‘ black site ’ prison – effectively a dungeon			0
he was then sent to @entity6 in february 2002 .			0
