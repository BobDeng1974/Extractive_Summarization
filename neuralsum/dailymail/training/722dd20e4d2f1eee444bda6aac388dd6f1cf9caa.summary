by @entity0 published : 13:11 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 13:24 est , 25 july 2013 slow motion film experts have filmed themselves firing guns underwater for the first time to show the mini tornadoes and unusual shapes created by the weapons			1
@entity7 and @entity8 , who are known on @entity9 as @entity10 , made a video to show the differing effects that two guns created in a freezing swimming pool			1
after being triggered , a tornado forms at the end of both guns for a few short seconds before the bullets sink down to the bottom of the pool and surrounding bubbles float to the surface			0
they recorded the effects with a specialist @entity26 high - speed camera , which can make the action 1,000 times slower than real life			1
the mesmerising footage was shot at 27,450 frames per second			0
@entity7 and @entity8 , who are known on @entity9 as @entity10 , made a video to show the differing effects that two guns created in a freezing swimming pool the bullets whiz through the water , leaving behind only trails of air pockets and gun powder			1
the men said : ' it sounded awesome underwater - like a metallic sound			0
' the revolver had more gas coming out when it was fired to produce more bubbles than the short - barreled pistol that can be seen in the video			2
the bullet fired from the revolver ( pictured ) whizzes through the water , leaving behind only trails of air pockets the @entity24 said : the noise from the revolver sounded ' awesome underwater - like a metallic sound ' the duo said : ' watching the bubbles appear and slowly dissipate is enough to bring you some much - needed midday zen			2
' the pair spent approximately one hour in the swimming pool , which was just four degrees @entity75 in temperature			2
more than 3.5 million people have viewed the video on @entity9			0
the revolver ( pictured ) had more gas coming out when it was fired to produce more bubbles than the short - barreled pistol after being triggered , a tornado forms at the end of the revolver for a few short seconds before the bullets sink down to the bottom of the pool and surrounding bubbles float to the surface firearms can be discharged underwater but bullets lose velocity rapidly and are rendered less lethal beyond a metre			1
the entire gun has to be submerged in water , with all air pockets removed in order to prevent a possible explosion when firing			0
the water pressure can cause used cartridge casings to fail to leave gun chambers after they were fired , which can make a gun only able to fire a single bullet			0
the duo recorded the effect of the revolver being fired ( pictured ) with a specialist @entity26 high - speed camera , which can make the action 1,000 times slower than real life the mesmerizing footage of the shot was filmed at 27,450 frames per second this is not the first time that an underwater bullet video has proven a @entity9 hit			1
firearms expert @entity120 filmed himself firing a range of weapons including a .40 glock 22 in his swimming pool , last year			1
however , he did not just fire the guns for fun like @entity10 , but insted collected the bullets to make ' tactical flowers ' for his mother			0
the resistance of the water caused the bullet to expand in perfect formation , creating beautiful lead blossoms			0
this is not the first time that an underwater bullet video has proven a @entity9 hit			2

slow motion film experts have filmed themselves firing guns underwater for the first time to produce a hit @entity9 video
the @entity24 show the differing effects that two guns - a pistol and a revolver - created in a swimming pool including mini tornadoes
they recorded the effects with a specialist @entity26 high - speed camera , which can make the action 1,000 times slower than real life
