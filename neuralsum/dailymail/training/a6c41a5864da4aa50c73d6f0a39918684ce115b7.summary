published : 08:40 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 02:59 est , 11 october 2012 it may have been an unlikely dream , but scientists have finally put paid to hopes of resurrecting dinosaurs from @entity4			1
a study of fossils found in @entity7 found that @entity4 has a half life of 521 years - meaning half the bonds between cells are broken after this time			1
' this confirms the widely held suspicion that claims of @entity4 from dinosaurs and ancient insects trapped in amber are incorrect , ' @entity11 , a computational evolutionary biologist at the @entity12 in @entity13 told @entity19			1
@entity28 led by @entity29 at the @entity30 and @entity31 at @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity13 , examined 158 dna - containing leg bones belonging to three species of extinct giant birds called moa			1
the bones , which were between 600 and 8,000 years old , had been recovered from three sites within 5 kilometres of each other , with nearly identical preservation conditions including a temperature of 13.1 ºc			2
by comparing the specimens ' ages and degrees of dna degradation , the researchers calculated that @entity4 has a half - life of 521 years - ruling out the dreams of bringing dinosaurs back to life			1
the findings are published today in @entity52			0
the team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of − 5 @entity57 , effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years			0
the dna would cease to be readable much earlier — perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years , when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information			1
however , some researchers have raised the question of whether fossils trapped in permafrost			1
' i am very interested to see if these findings can be reproduced in very different environments such as permafrost and caves , ' @entity65 , a palaeogeneticist at the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity7 , told nature			2
researchers also admit several other factors could help preserve dna			2
@entity76 , director of the @entity77 for @entity4 at the @entity78 , @entity13 , said : ' the rotting process after death is very seasonal and context dependent , and has a major impact on dna survival			1
' last week the @entity84 reports a male mammoth which died about 30,000 years ago at the age of 15 had been found frozen in permafrost - and hope to find @entity4			1
the boy who made the astonishing discovery has been named as @entity90 , @entity91 reported			0
he found the frozen beast in @entity93 , north @entity94 , where he lives with his family , close to the @entity97 polar station			0
woolly mammoths have been found in the permafrost in @entity100 since at least 1929 , but this is one of the best preserved , researchers believe			2
its tusks , mouth and rib cage are clearly visible			0
rare : it is believed the remains - which include a tusk - are the right half of the body , weighing in at 500kg remains : it is believed to be a male which died about 30,000 years ago at the age of 15 after telling his parents about his incredible find , scientists were able to confirm the discovery			0
it is believed to be the second best preserved mammoth ever unearthed and the best mammoth discovery since 1901			0
it has now been named @entity127 after the boy 's nickname and will be studied by scientists			0
@entity130 , a mammoth specialist with the @entity131 , told journalists that the last time such a well - preserved mammoth was found in @entity94 was in 1901 , also in the @entity135 region , but much farther south , according to the statement			0
the carcass will become an exhibit at the @entity139 , but museum staff have agreed to allow scientists from zoological and paleontological institutes in @entity143 and @entity144 study it first .			0

@entity147 rules out *possibility* of recovering *viable* dna from dinosaurs
however , some *experts* claim animals trapped in permafrost could still have *retained* @entity4 *structure*
