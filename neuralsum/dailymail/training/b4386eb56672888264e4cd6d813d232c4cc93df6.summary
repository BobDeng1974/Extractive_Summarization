by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 26 september 2012 a @entity2 couple have been living in a garage for four - and - a - half years after their house in southern @entity6 was demolished over ' planning irregularities '			1
@entity8 and @entity9 prior , both 68 , are now launching a landmark legal case to get compensation after their luxury villa became the first home owned by @entity2 to be bulldozed - despite having the correct planning permission from the @entity6 authorities			1
the retired expats have been living in the garage on the plot of their demolished home since 2008 , when the villa was destroyed			2
ground - breaking : @entity9 and @entity23 - pictured at their partly - demolished villa in @entity25 - say their compensation claim is their last hope the couple have turned the villa 's former garage and workshop into a cramped dwelling - and have converted an adjacent caravan into a bathroom ramshackle : the couple 's makeshift home , which they put together on the plot of their partly - demolished villa the couple claim the construction of their home - in @entity25 on @entity6 's southern @entity46 - was above board and was given the green light by the local town hall			1
however , their licence was revoked by the regional government of @entity53 who claimed there were ' planning irregularities ' and ordered its destruction			0
it is unclear precisely what these irregularities were , but - a year after their home was destroyed - the @entity62 won a small victory when @entity6 's @entity64 ruled demolition was illegal , the @entity58 reported			1
their only option now is to sue the @entity6 judiciary - but it could mean the couple spend the rest of their twilight years battling it out in the courts			1
mrs prior told @entity58 : ' it 's our last hope but we 've been warned it would be a ground breaking case			1
the @entity6 authorities hope that we will give up and just go home			1
' but this is our home			2
we have nowhere else to go to			0
i do wonder how many years i have left to live and it 's so upsetting to think that they will probably be spent fighting on			0
but we wo n't give up			0
' landmark case : the @entity62 have been warned they could spend the rest of their years battling in the courts the @entity62 say they have been advised that , because the demolition order was signed by a judge , legal action should be taken against the judiciary system itself			1
according to the ruling by the @entity64 , @entity6 law was broken when the destruction order was signed , not only because the authorities had failed to inform the @entity62 of the decision but also as an appeal was pending on their case			1
the couple are now awaiting a court date after travelling to @entity100 to file their case against the @entity102			2
however , they have been warned the legal process could take years and , even if they win , the @entity6 authorities might not even be able to pay			1
the country is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy as the economic crisis worsens			0
the @entity62 were among the earliest victims of a series of illegal building scandals in @entity6 which arose after a development boom - fuelled mainly by @entity2 buyers - in the 1990s swamped stretches of the @entity117 coast with apartments and villas			2
during the frenzied years of building , many local town halls apparently turned a blind eye to planning regulations or even took bribes to grant building licences to thousands of homes that were constructed on protected land			0
after the heartbreaking ordeal of seeing their dream retirement villa destroyed , the @entity62 now call this home @entity132 : a poster saying ' make do and mend ' in the couple 's makeshift kitchen is an ironic nod to their ordeal this caravan is now the couple 's bathroom			2
they use a water pipe belonging to a neighbour and get electricity from a generator however , crackdowns by regional and national governments led to the arrest of dozens of planning officials , and thousands of homes were under threat of demolition			0
@entity8 and @entity9 prior sold their family home in @entity157 , @entity158 , and built a Â£ 350,000 retirement villa in the seaside town of @entity25 in @entity161 nine years ago			1
the luxury villa was built to their own design specifications and was affectionately given the name of ' @entity166 ' to reflect the couple 's hopes of how they would spent their retirement			0
from the start they did everything by the book , employing a reputable lawyer and obtaining a building licence from @entity25 town hall before the property was built			0
what they did n't know was that behind the scenes , the regional government in @entity182 had already warned town hall planners that the development should not go ahead because it entailed urbanisation of ' rustic ' land			0
in january 2008 , their home was demolished in front of them after a dramatic stand - off during which mr prior , who has a heart condition , collapsed and was taken to hospital			2
a bulldozer ploughs into the couple 's home , back in 2008 , pulling down the property they had put all of their savings into dashed dreams : @entity9 tends to @entity8 on the ground after he collapsed when their home was bulldozed in 2008 the @entity62 in front of the remains of the demolished home , a property built to their own design and was affectionately named ' @entity166 ' after clearing the rubble , the @entity62 - bit - by - bit - converted the garage and workshop once adjoining the villa into a cramped dwelling and an old caravan has been turned into a makeshift bathroom while a shed has become a lavatory			1
there is no mains electricity source , so power comes from a small generator and they use a neighbour 's water pipe			0
mr prior said in a previous interview : ' we 're pensioners and we should n't have to live like this			0
' we could n't have done more to ensure our home was legal			2
what 's happened makes me extremely angry and it 's the anger that keeps me going			0
if it was n't for the anger , i think i 'd collapse			0
' in fighting the case , the couple 's legal bills in their compensation fight - as well as a new licence to rebuild their home - has grown to 150,000 euros			1
mr prior told @entity58 : ' i can honestly say that that they [ @entity53 government ] have wrecked our lives			1
they have taken everything we worked for away from us , 45 years of working hard and now we have nothing			0

@entity8 and @entity9 prior have been told an order to bulldoze their home was ' illegal '
couple now plan to take legal action in a compensation bid against the @entity6 authorities
