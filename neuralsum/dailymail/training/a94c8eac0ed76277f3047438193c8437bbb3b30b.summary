a quick jog here , a shoving match there			2
throw in a laundry basket , a concealed headset and talk of telescopes and you understand why @entity8 is touchline box office			1
on sunday , at @entity11 , his latest stunt was to enter @entity13 ’s dugout for a chat			1
here , @entity15 offers @entity8 a little advice on touchline etiquette … do stay until the end of the game … for a man of untold wealth , you previously justified your habit of leaving early by saying you wanted to phone your wife with the score			1
no internet connection at home ? no @entity30 subscription ? one of these days it will get you in trouble , @entity33			2
surely the angry eyes above @entity36 ’s beard told you that much a few weeks back			2
wait an extra couple of minutes or send your wife a text			2
@entity8 ( second right ) angered @entity41 boss @entity40 ( centre ) when he tried to shake his hand before the end of their @entity46 encounter at @entity47 in september do n’t climb into other managers ' dugouts … everyone knows that the @entity13 managerial situation might once have be a bit of a sore point			1
‘ should have been me ’ , and all that			2
but climbing into the dugout after the game on sunday ? even if it was to see your old mate @entity58 , it ’s a bit much			1
@entity8 ( left ) climbed into the @entity13 dugout to exchange pleasantries with @entity63 do n't think outside the box … rightly or wrongly , those technical areas are here to stay and that means you stay as well			1
none of this charging down the line with waving arms when you score			2
same goes for knee slides			0
it ’s entertaining but it drives fans feral			0
@entity8 infamously ran down the @entity13 touchline when his @entity80 side knocked them out of @entity82 in 2004 do n’t go on one of your jaunts and shamelessly pass on tactical information … it ’s one thing to leave your technical area to celebrate ( which is n’t really that bad but it is against the rules ) , yet it is quite another when you do it to pass on tactical information , as you did against @entity94 in the @entity95 in april			1
everyone thought you were simply re-enacting your 2004 jog when @entity80 beat @entity13			1
but you kindly confirmed you were passing on tactical instructions to @entity99			0
we ’re not convinced that explanation made it ok			0
@entity104 boss ( second right ) admitted he illegally delivered tactics to his players when he ran down the touchline in their @entity95 quarter - final win against @entity94 last season do keep your head during intense rivalries … poking the @entity112 in the eye during @entity114 was a low point			1
in 2011 , @entity8 ( left ) poked then @entity117 assistant @entity116 in the eye while in charge of @entity120 do n’t repeatedly bait @entity121 … @entity121 is combustible and he , too , can be provocative , as his recent shove against your chest demonstrated			1
but there is no need to taunt him so mercilessly			0
calling him a ‘ specialist in failure ’ was rather unkind and the whole voyeur argument was a little unnecessary too			0
is the following really how you should speak of a fellow professional : ‘ he is someone who likes to watch other people			0
there are some guys who have this big telescope to see what happens in other families			0
he must be one of them			0
’ @entity121 ’s response was : ‘ when you give success to stupid people , it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent			0
’ the pair of you sometimes act like articulate five - year - olds			1
@entity8 ( right ) has repeatedly goaded @entity145 boss @entity121 ( left ) during his managerial career do stay on the right side of diligent and do n’t go too far … it ’s true that there have been occasions where you have been punished for comments that others could make without censure			1
that is a double standard and unfair			0
but it ’s also true that while you are right to speak out against officials for poor decisions – and some of those by @entity162 in the @entity13 game on sunday were poor – you can also go too far			1
accusing @entity117 manager @entity164 of visiting referee @entity165 at half - time during a @entity95 match in 2005 was going too far			1
@entity165 elected to retire because of death threats and you were called ‘ an enemy of football ’			0
referee @entity165 ( centre right ) was forced to retire after receiving death threats do n’t hide in laundry baskets ... you were given a two - game ban for that @entity178 incident and , hats off , your alleged solution was ingenious			2
in the first instance , it is believed you were feeding information to the touchline via a headset worn by fitness coach @entity186 , disguised by a hat			2
it is also claimed that you were smuggled out of a dressing room – from which you were banned – in a laundry trolley			0
all very clever but not allowed			0
do be respectful to fans / press … that means not holding your finger to your lips in front of the @entity199 fans , as you did after your late equaliser in the 2005 league cup final			0
you later said it was a gesture to the press , but that ’s not ok , either			0
@entity8 infuriated @entity199 fans with his ' hush ' celebration during their 2005 @entity207 vs @entity104 do n’t wear a scarf and no coat … sunday ’s look was odd			1
like short sleeves and gloves			0
the @entity104 boss elected to wear a scarf without a coat during sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity11			1

@entity8 's touchline antics have become notorious during his career
@entity8 entered the @entity13 dugout to exchange pleasantries with @entity63 after their 1 - 1 draw at @entity11 on sunday
