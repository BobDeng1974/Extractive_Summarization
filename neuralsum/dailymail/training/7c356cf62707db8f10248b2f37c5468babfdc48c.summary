by @entity0 published : 10:55 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 9 january 2013 most people would find juggling two adolescent children , a @entity4 therapy practice and just one relationship time consuming enough			1
but 38 - year - old widow @entity6 der @entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , is not most people , and after the death of her doctor husband nine years ago the mother - of - two decided she wanted more than one man in her life - and that marriage was for ' mugs '			1
now the sex therapist maintains relationships with three men - a property tycoon , a multimillionaire who runs a solar panel company in @entity24 , and her ' bit of rough ' electrician - and has written a book telling others how they could do the same			1
@entity6 der @entity29 practices as a sexual and relationship expert in @entity4 and her own retreat in @entity32 , @entity33 ' there are simply far too many great men out there for me to settle for just one , ' said the middle - class mother , who says each man she is dating knows they are not in an exclusive relationship with @entity6 , but are still perfectly happy with the arrangement			1
@entity6 , who practices as a sexual and relationship expert both in @entity4 and at her own retreat in @entity32 , @entity33 , says her model wo n't work for everyone , but it has brought her happiness			1
she said : ' if you are having great sex and great relationships all areas of your life are impacted positively			1
some people find happiness in a relationship with one person			2
i have it with three			0
' insisting she does n't feel cheap sharing her body with more than one lover , @entity6 added : ' the fact is , i have a deep connection with all three men			0
' yes i have sex with all of them but not at the same time			2
i would n't say that i have a ridiculously high sex drive			2
the average person has sex two or three times a week - i might be a little bit more than that , but not much more			2
' @entity6 says she is completely happy with her three lovers , as are they maintaining that she shields her two children - a daughter aged 11 and a son of 16 - from her private life , @entity6 explained how she has been seeing the 40 - year - old @entity24 - based solar panel tycoon for the past six years after meeting by chance at an airport			1
' he is aware that i see other men and is quite happy with the situation , ' she said			0
she was introduced to lover number two - a @entity84 - based property tycoon in his 30s who appeared on @entity87 's @entity86 - by mutual friend , and they have been seeing each other for a year			1
' he is very sexy and dynamic - i have always been attracted to high - achieving men , ' she said			2
lover number three is a young electrician who lives near her in @entity9 - and is happy to pop round when she asks			1
' he is great - we met quite by chance after we got chatting on the train to @entity84			2
he is quite young and completely different to my other two lovers			2
' @entity6 claims the arrangement works because she has always been completely honest with her partners			0
' i have counselled numerous people and have seen how it can work for them too			0
we are all on a different journey			0
you have to follow your gut feelings to achieve happiness			0
' @entity6 also believes many people are ' deluding themselves ' when they say are happily married			1
she saidl : ' the controversial truth is that the state of marriage - and , more importantly , the monogamy it entails - is n't really working for most people in today 's society			1
' okay , it works for some , and that 's wonderful when it does bring happiness			0
i 've got the utmost respect for their choice			0
' but the sad reality is that many people simply can not live up to the expectations of life and sex with a single partner			1
' and that almost inevitably causes cheating , marital breakdowns , recriminations , divorce , spousal abandonment and misery			0
' @entity6 has outlined how her new model for relationships in a new book , @entity139			1
she explained : ' what if the fairytale version of love and marriage we stumbled upon in storybooks when we were kids , is simply incompatible with the modern world ? ' look around you			0
how many friends are now on their second - or even third - marriages ? be honest			0
' the sad fact is that too many relationships are coiled with deceit , insecurity or just plain apathy , as the foundations at their core were wrong from the start			0
' so why in the 21st century do we still keep trying to make an outdated model of relationships work ? why do n't we have the honesty and integrity to admit we all want a bit more out of life ? ' saying that ' many people simply do n't have time for the old model of relationship ' , @entity6 feels many people are instead choosing to spend time with lots of people they like			1
@entity6 der @entity29 has now written a book , left , explaining how other people can use her ' relationship model ' ' opening the door to your heart so wide it 's okay for people to come and go as they choose is n't always easy and it 's not for everyone			1
' that way we can make ourselves and others happy , without the pressures or expectations that arise from a traditional , and , i would argue , outdated , one - man , one - woman relationship			1
it seems so obvious to me now			0
' i 'm living the new model of relationships , and i can assure you , it not only works , it 'll help you reach new heights of intimacy , that you may not have ever previously dreamed possible			2
