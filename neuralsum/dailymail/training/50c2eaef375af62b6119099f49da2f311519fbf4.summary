for most of his special day , @entity0 prince george alexander louis of @entity2 viewed proceedings with a kind of calm approval			2
those present expressed relief – and surprise – he remained serene			0
it was too much to dare to hope the future king would bless them with a smile			0
but when the christening was over , when the group photographs were done , his mother cradled him inches from her adoring face for his official portrait and it was then that three - month - old @entity20 , saving the best until last , returned her gaze with a beam , then a little burst of giggles			1
adorable : @entity27 beams at @entity28 as their eyes meet , and @entity31 looks on proudly unity : for the first time in more than 100 years four generations of the @entity34 gathered for the christening family : celebrity photographer @entity38 was called upon to capture these stunning images from @entity27 's christening completing the charming image , a quietly composed prince @entity31 looked down proudly upon his son ’s smiling face			1
in the picture , taken in the @entity44 of @entity45 , @entity31 leans against @entity28 , unsmiling but protective , forcing the eye to focus first on the joyous expressions of his wife and child			1
by far the most intimate of the christening portraits , it also exemplifies the bond between mother and child in a way that is rare for official royal photographs , which can often seem stilted			2
heir : the @entity59 posed with three generations of male heirs in the @entity44 of @entity45 it is in marked contrast , for instance , to a picture taken the same day of the @entity67 and @entity68 dynasties grouped around a @entity70 sofa			1
for @entity28 , her son ’s exemplary behaviour at his baptism on wednesday was an unexpected joy			1
speaking at a @entity77 reception and dinner on friday night , she told a guest : ‘ he ’s not always like that but i think he enjoys all the different people and i think there was lots of action going on			0
‘ he was such a good boy – actually we ’re very lucky			0
’ the relaxed tone for the christening was set from the off when , as he carried @entity20 into the chapel at @entity90 , @entity31 quipped : ‘ perfect timing			1
he ’s just gone quiet			0
’ and so he remained			0
there was the tiniest suggestion of a regal wave at one point and later a frown , but for the most part @entity20 appeared surprisingly peaceful			1
this was the baby whose father had warned has a ‘ voice to match any lion ’s roar ’			0
it made life easier for 44 - year - old celebrity photographer @entity38			1
@entity107 does n’t have to worry about eliciting a smile from his subjects – he has previously worked with @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			0
but with @entity20 , his most high - profile commission to date , he had his work cut out			1
until , that is , the @entity28 stepped in with her own winning smile			1
for the first time in more than 100 years , four generations of the @entity34 were gathered for the christening			2
and @entity38 captured the @entity59 with her three male heirs , posing formally			1
it echoes an 1894 image from the future @entity124 ’s christening , showing him with his father , grandfather and great - grandmother – @entity20 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
calm : the @entity130 behaved throughout his christening and was described as an ' amazing gift ' by the archbishop of @entity134 low - key : the christening , at the @entity137 in @entity90 on wednesday , was attended by just five senior @entity138 , the @entity139 , prince @entity140 , the @entity141 and prince @entity142 earlier the archbishop of canterbury @entity143 told the parents and godparents that they had a ‘ simple task ’ – to ‘ make sure he knows who this @entity149 is ’			2
@entity151 carried her newly christened son out of the chapel after the ceremony , and the guests then left for tea hosted by the @entity130 at @entity45			1
attending a reception at @entity159 after the event , the @entity59 told guests how much she had enjoyed the ceremony			0
‘ it was very nice though , was n’t it ? ’ she told the @entity162 , the right reverend @entity163			0
the @entity139 and @entity28 surprised many by choosing seven godparents for @entity27 , with @entity168 , princess @entity169 ’s daughter , the only royal among them			2
@entity172 : supporting her sister during the ceremony was @entity68 , pictured leaving @entity175 after the celebrations ended keepsake : however her £ 7,000 gift for @entity20 , a solid silver copy of his hands and feet , has raised eyebrows by tradition , members of the @entity34 have six godparents , but the couple opted for one more so that they could accommodate a broad mix of aristocrats , family , and school and university friends			2
the @entity139 , whose late mother , @entity193 , @entity193 , is never far from his thoughts , also included one of her close friends , @entity196			0
the godparents were among just 22 guests at the ceremony			0
meanwhile yesterday , speaking ahead of a dinner to mark the @entity203 ’s 150th anniversary , prince @entity31 said he will be taking @entity27 to see his favourite team , @entity204			0
