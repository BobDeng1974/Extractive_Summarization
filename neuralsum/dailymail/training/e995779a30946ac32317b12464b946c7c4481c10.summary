by @entity0 published : 03:33 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 04:46 est , 18 october 2013 @entity1 has urged @entity2 not to hang a convicted drug smuggler for a second time after he survived his initial execution			1
' @entity6 ' , 37 , was pronounced dead after hanging for 12 minutes at the @entity10 regime 's @entity8 prison last wednesday following his conviction for possessing crystal meth			1
but when his family went to collect the body from the following day , they noticed he was still breathing and rushed him to hospital			1
now , in a case branded ' misguided ' and ' inhumane ' by the human rights group , he is being nursed back to health until he is ' well enough ' to return to the gallows to be re-hanged			0
@entity2 has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any other nation except @entity28			2
this convicted murderer @entity29 was hanged in 2002 ' carrying out a second execution on a man who somehow managed to survive 12 minutes of hanging – who was certified as dead and whose body was about to be turned over to his family – is simply ghastly , ' said @entity35 , director of @entity1 's @entity36 and @entity37			1
' it betrays a basic lack of humanity that sadly underpins much of @entity2 ’s justice system			1
' so far in 2013 , the @entity2 authorities are believed to have executed a total of at least 508 people , including 221 executions that have not been officially confirmed , said the human rights group			0
@entity2 is second only to @entity28 in the number of people it puts to death for crimes ranging from murder and rape to spying and drug - trafficking			1
' inhumane ' : it is believed around 200 people have been put to death in @entity2 since its new president @entity58 came to power in june ' it is natural that the @entity2 authorities must combat the serious social , security and economic problems relating to drug trafficking and drug abuse , ' added mr @entity35			2
' but the reliance on the death penalty to combat drug trafficking is misguided and in violation of international law			0
' one family member told @entity2 's state - run media : ' when we were told the death sentence had been carried out , we went to collect his body to prepare for a memorial service			1
' but when we went to the coroner 's office we found him alive again , which made his two daughters very happy			0
' once officials were told @entity6 had survived , they put him under armed guard at the hospital to await a second execution			0
a judiciary official told the state media : ' the verdict was the death sentence , and it will be carried out once the man gets well again			0
' @entity2 has executed an estimated 560 people this year - including around 200 that have been put to death since new ' moderate ' president @entity58 came to power in june			1
@entity58 vowed to end the repression of the previous regime , but human rights groups have said executions have actually increased under his rule			0
@entity2 has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any nation except @entity28			2
many of the condemned are executed for theft , drugs - related offences , not following the rules of @entity10 or criticising the government			2
they are often hanged publicly in town centres or from bridges and cranes			0
@entity112 , of the campaign group @entity113 , said : ' @entity58 was quoted saying he wanted to empty the prisons - it seems the regime intends to do so via executions			0

the 37 - year - old was put to death in the @entity10 regime 's @entity8 prison
after 12 minutes he was certified dead and taken to a morgue
when his family went to collect his body the next day he was still breathing
guards are waiting for him to *recover* enough so he can be hanged again
@entity1 : ' this case betrays basic lack of humanity of @entity2 's justice system '
