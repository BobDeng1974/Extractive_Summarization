by @entity1 reporter back in the day : @entity2 has repeatedly spoken publicly about his involvement in the protest but he never mentioned anything about weapons attorney general @entity2 may have been armed when he and some fellow @entity8 students occupied an abandoned school office and demanded that it be rededicated to @entity10 conservative news site @entity11 reported that when he was a sophomore at the @entity13 school , a then - 20 - year - old @entity2 was an active member of the @entity14 who fittingly sported a similar hair style at the time			1
they cite old student archives which allege that @entity2 and his fellow protestors were ' armed ' when they took control of the then - abandoned office space that had previously been used to house the campus chapter of the @entity23			1
@entity2 's involvement in the protest is undisputed , and the @entity26 reported in 2009 that @entity2 was recruited by upperclassmen to participate in the five - day occupation			2
in their report , however , the students were ' armed with pillowcases and sheets '			0
the @entity26 also contradicts the @entity11 report , saying that @entity2 was a freshman and not a sophomore at the time of the occupation , and says that it took place in 1969 rather than 1970			0
@entity2 's close college friend @entity38 confirmed in both the @entity26 article and a @entity41 profile that both he and @entity42 participated in the protest , but in neither did he mention weapons			1
the @entity11 's report does not specify what weapons they believe @entity2 and his compatriots held during the sit - in , but they imply that their tools were more dangerous than simply bedding			0
the website credits the weapons claim to the @entity54 , which has since taken over for the @entity14			0
they say that on @entity58 website , the occupiers were ' armed ' during the raid , but that portion of the @entity58 website is not readily available			0
politically active : in the early 1970s , racial tensions were rife both on and off @entity8 's campus ( pictured recently ) similar stories : @entity2 graduated from @entity8 years before @entity65 and @entity65 supposedly spent many hours in the @entity10 lounge that @entity2 helped rededicate to the black leader @entity68 contacted the @entity70 's press office about the claims and has yet to receive a response			1
racial tensions were rife both on and off the pristine grounds of the @entity76 campus at the time of the protest , and the student group decided to take over the unused space so that it could be rededicated as a place for students of color to meet			2
in a recent biography of president @entity65 , who went on to study at the same university years after @entity2 had graduated , author @entity84 reports that a young mr @entity65 spent many hours in the @entity10 lounge			2
even though university officials initially decried their actions as they went against the school 's rules , given the circumstances , they found it appropriate to rename the space the @entity95 and declined to press any punitive charges against the students involved			0
the timing of this new allegation of @entity2 's involvement with weapons comes just one month after he was cleared of any wrong doing in the @entity103 scandal , where one @entity105 officer died as a result of a failed gun trafficking plot .			1

as a college student , @entity2 participated in a protest where *dozens* took over an empty office space in hopes of *turning* it into a black student lounge
*unearthed* archives claim that the protestors were ' armed ' during the raid
@entity2 , now attorney general , was just cleared of wrong doing in the @entity103 gun trafficking scandal
