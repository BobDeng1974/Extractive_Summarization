rating : the pub - with - rooms phenomena continues apace in @entity2 - and this is a classic of the genre , executed with style and panache by a couple of twentysomethings who met at @entity9			1
this is their third @entity11 ( @entity13 and @entity14 are up and running ) , in what used to be a traditional boozer in @entity17 , a short walk from @entity19			1
if the bones of a building are important , here they 're as good as they get			1
a bright splash of colour on the canvas : artist residence has brought a dash of flair to an old pub built by @entity32 in 1852 , the grand , stuccoed house is on four floors - five if you count the basement , where there 's a dimly lit bar and sitting room for hotel guests			1
i feel good the moment i walk in			1
there is no fuss at reception and , unlike the @entity45 nearby , there is a separate entrance for those staying the night , so you do n't have to shout your name at the bar or get handed a packet of crisps rather than your room key			1
i 've booked a @entity56 room , but am upgraded to @entity57 because not many of the ten rooms are occupied			1
everything about the loft is charming : the wooden floors and panelled walls , bare brick , white paint			2
the bedhead is a gate and the lights ( all on dimmers ) are industrial , with @entity69 anglepoise lamps on the bedside tables			2
the cupboard must have been reclaimed from an office			2
in fact , reclamation seems to be a theme			2
' the countryside comes to town ' is another			0
the bathroom is part of the bedroom , with a separate shower and enclosed loo			0
two sturdy sash windows look terrific and , hallelujah , you can open them			0
the restaurant is called 64 @entity88			0
the idea is that the chefs are part of the eating experience , especially if you sit at the bar , as i do			0
small plates of this and that are the order of the day under three sections : veg , fish and meat , with four options for each			0
@entity107 gyoza , pear and fennel has me leaning over the bar and asking one of the chefs for an explanation			0
there are no side dishes of any description - and no carbs as far as i can see			1
dr @entity117 would feel at home			0
there 's a bubbly , unpretentious atmosphere , though i would expect proper napkins rather than paper jobbies at these prices			0
frankly , that 's about the only criticism i can muster			0
artist residence 52 @entity127 street @entity2 @entity128 020 7931 8946 @entity129 doubles from Â£ 150 , room only			1

stylish pub - with - rooms is a *discreet* hideaway close to @entity19
artist residence has taken over what used to be a traditional boozer
the two owners also have similar properties in @entity13 and @entity14
