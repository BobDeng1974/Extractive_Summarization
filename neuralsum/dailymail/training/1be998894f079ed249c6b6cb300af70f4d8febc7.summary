by @entity0 plastic surgeons have developed a stem cell treatment to overcome the one remaining giveaway of a woman ’s true age – her crinkly hands			1
it will solve the problem of ‘ @entity10 mitts ’ – named after the singer @entity10 who has otherwise held back time but whose veiny hands betray her true 55 years			1
while diet , exercise and face lifts mean many women look much younger than their age , hands are still a sure giveaway			1
@entity10 has otherwise held back time but her veiny hands betray her true 55 years the new treatment breaks down fat taken from the patient ’s body to produce a solution of stem cells			1
the liquid is then injected just below the surface of the skin and these stem cells transform into skin cells over weeks and months , thickening and smoothing the skin			2
doctors behind the treatment , which is referred to as nanofat grafting , are also using it to reduce dark circles under the eyes , caused by thinning skin , and to rejuvenate the neck and breast area			2
dr @entity41 and colleagues at the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , have carried out nanofat injections on 100 patients , of which about ten were into patients ’ hands			2
dr @entity41 said : ‘ injecting nanofat improves the skin ’s quality			0
it makes it smoother and corrects imperfections to reverse the crepey and wrinkly texture that affects women from their late 40s and 50s			0
’ skin naturally thins with age , he said , making muscle , bone and veins more visible			0
the skin itself also becomes more textured as it loses elasticity			0
hands exhibit these signs very clearly because they have little fat to begin with			0
while diet and exercise mean many women look much younger than their age , hands are still a sure giveaway he added : ‘ hands have been a little bit overlooked for a long time by plastic surgeons			1
we are finding there is huge demand for this			0
’ dr @entity41 ’s hand treatments , which cost between £ 1,300 and £ 1,700 , include nanofat as well as injections of slightly larger ‘ micro fat ’ , to plump up lost fat volume , and lasering to get rid of small dark liver spots			0
these ‘ micro fat ’ injections , of fat harvested from the patient ’s thighs , buttocks or stomach with very fine needles , have already been used in plastic surgery for some time			1
the former president of the @entity100 , @entity101 , has said there is no evidence that dr @entity41 ’s stem cell method is superior to existing fat - injection treatments			1
but leading @entity107 surgeon dr @entity106 said results suggested nanofat could be ‘ truly regenerative ’ .			0
