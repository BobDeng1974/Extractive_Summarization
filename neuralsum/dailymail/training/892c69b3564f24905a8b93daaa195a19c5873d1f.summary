' i have spent the past few years zipping around the country , looking for things to picture			0
the results as shocking as they are revealing			0
@entity13 ’s collection displays a mixture of endearing photographs and more startling ones of religious graffiti and home made drug tools ' funerals			1
@entity94 said : ' the picture of the make shift crack pipe , made out of a @entity54 can , was taken in leafy @entity53 , a five minute walk from @entity98			2

@entity110 : @entity13 saw many derelict houses on his travels around the @entity16 , but this building in @entity114 struck a chord bleak outlook : a local of @entity118 walks past a church sign under a grey sky , painting a miserable portrait of credit crunch @entity2 under watch : this @entity125 camera outside a bedroom in @entity127 , @entity46 was significant to @entity13 because the town was the first in the @entity16 to install the cameras in 1987 safe education : a staff member at a @entity134 school checks a pupil for weapons at the start of the school day @entity20 launched his @entity21 in 2010 as a scheme to empower communities , something he said he was ' great passion			1

those images sit alongside more light - hearted portraits , like one of a conker enthusiast , right , at the world championships in @entity188 land protest : farmers in @entity191 use a scarecrow to protest against imported food and crops			2
