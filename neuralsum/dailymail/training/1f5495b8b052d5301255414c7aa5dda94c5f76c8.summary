@entity0 last night claimed a qualified victory over the @entity2 as he declared @entity3 will only have to pay half of its controversial £ 1.7billion budget surcharge			1
but the chancellor faced an immediate backlash from critics who said he was taking credit for a discount that would always have been offered			1
mr @entity0 said the @entity3 would make two payments next year totalling £ 850million instead of £ 1.7billion in a lump sum by december this year			1
but the @entity19 hit back , claiming it had always intended to apply the complex budget rebate system to the payment , dramatically reducing the bill			2
critics accused mr @entity0 of ‘ smoke and mirrors ’			1
treasury officials firmly disputed that account , saying @entity3 had to ‘ work hard ’ to ensure the most generous calculation possible using the traditional rebate formula was applied and for the discount to be given in advance , rather than a year in arrears as is usual			2
the deal struck last night means that @entity34 ’s budget rebate , which she negotiated in 1984 , will be applied to the one - off demand for extra payment			0
the controversial surcharge was landed on mr @entity38 at a @entity40 summit last month			0
@entity2 budget rules allow for member states ’ payments to be adjusted based on revisions to assessments of their economic performance			1
the latest review of the economies of @entity2 member states since 1995 showed @entity3 had done significantly better than previously thought – triggering the huge bill			2
@entity38 angrily insisted the @entity3 would pay nothing by the december deadline and called yesterday ’s emergency meeting of finance ministers in @entity40 for the overall sum to be renegotiated			1
@entity38 angrily insisted the @entity3 would pay nothing by the december deadline and called the emergency meeting of @entity2 finance ministers the @entity3 will now pay the smaller sum in two interest - free instalments in july and september 2015			1
the chancellor said : ‘ we have worked intensively and constructively with the vice president of the @entity19 and with the other member states and today i can say this : instead of footing the bill , we have halved the bill , we have delayed the bill , we will pay no interest on the bill and if there are mistakes in the bill we will get our money back			2
’ @entity75 , vice president of the @entity19 , said : ‘ the adjustments for the @entity3 means that @entity3 has to pay more , but also that as a result of this increase , the @entity3 rebate will go up			2
’ asked if the rebate had been in doubt , the @entity19 vice-president said : ‘ no , absolutely not			0
’ but @entity83 sources claimed the @entity19 was seeking to save face and avoid controversy with other member states by suggesting the rebate was always going to be applied			0
the prime minister , attending a meeting of the leaders of @entity91 and @entity92 states in @entity93 , said : ‘ these negotiations have gone well for @entity3			0
the chancellor has done well			0
’ shadow chancellor @entity96 has called @entity0 's announcement as all ' smoke and mirrors ' challenged that the lower figure was inevitable because of the rebate calculation , mr @entity38 insisted : ‘ this was far from inevitable			1
the bill has been halved , the bill has been delayed , no interest is being paid on the bill and we ’ve changed the rules so that this ca n’t happen again and that is very good news			0
’ but shadow chancellor @entity96 said : ‘ @entity38 and @entity0 are trying to take the @entity3 people for fools			1
ministers have failed to get a better deal for the @entity3 taxpayer			0
not a single penny has been saved for the taxpayer compared to two weeks ago when @entity38 was blustering in @entity40			0
‘ by counting the rebate @entity3 was due anyway they are desperately trying to claim that the backdated bill for £ 1.7billion has somehow been halved			1
but nobody will fall for this smoke and mirrors			0
