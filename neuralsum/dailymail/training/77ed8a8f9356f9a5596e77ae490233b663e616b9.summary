@entity0 : @entity1 with @entity2 , who was given 18 months to live but has survived after a series of treatments he was devastated when his beloved dog buster died of cancer			1
so when vets told @entity8 his pet @entity2 was suffering the same condition and had only 18 months to live , he decided to do all he could to save her			1
ignoring advice to have her put down , the chat show host and @entity1 star is paying £ 8,000 for the cairn terrier to undergo intense chemotherapy and surgery			1
@entity2 has made guest appearances on his @entity20 tea - time show since 2006 and is so close to his heart that he named his production firm @entity24 after her			1
@entity8 , 58 , who had 12 stents inserted into his arteries after two heart attacks , said the cost of the expensive treatments was not an issue			2
‘ she has had her kidney out and is now on chemo , ’ he said			0
‘ her operation cost twice as much as it did to give me a stent – it was £ 8,000			0
but i do n’t care what it costs as i would sell my house to pay for it			1
’ the treatment seems to have been successful so far as the star revealed the nine - year - old dog was ‘ flying around at the moment like a puppy ’			2
@entity8 was described as ‘ absolutely gutted ’ when @entity44 , his 14 - year - old shihtzu - bichon frise cross , was put down in 2009			2
the comedian developed a strong bond with the dog after rescuing him from a motorway and gave the full name of @entity52			1

co-stars : they have worked together on the @entity59 and years ago with @entity1 as @entity1 namesake : the comedian has even named his production firm - @entity24 - after his beloved pet @entity44 had appeared with @entity8 ’s alter ego @entity1 on the @entity65 and was replaced by @entity2 on his chat show			1

a memorial statue was made of buster for @entity73 , where @entity8 presents @entity75 show @entity74 and is also a celebrity ambassador			2
@entity77 , of the @entity78 , said it can be a ‘ challenge ’ to detect cancer in animals , but that treatments had improved following research into the human form of the illness			1
an mri scan - £ 2,000 chemotherapy - up to £ 5,000 overnight stay at vet 's surgery - up to £ 55 a dog 's arthritis tablets for one year - £ 120 blood test for a dog - £ 128 castrating a cat - £ 52 parasite treatment for a rabbit - £ 50 dental surgery for a cat - £ 233 a dog 's x-ray - £ 232 surgery on a cat 's cataracts - £ 1,600 for one eye or £ 2,400 for operations on both ‘ some cancers are quite obvious to diagnose , but for example , blood cancer , can be quite difficult , ’ she said			1
‘ there are three ways to treat the cancer : surgically remove it , radiotherapy under general anaesthetic as the dog has to remain very still or chemotherapy			1
' using chemotherapy on dogs does not produce the awful side - effects as in humans like losing hair because you are trying to prolong life for up to a couple of years – which is a lot for a dog – not completely cure it			0
‘ the £ 8,000 bill is not eyebrow - raising as it involves surgery			0
it probably costs around £ 4,000 for chemotherapy at a specialist centre and that ’s why people take out pet insurance			0
