by @entity0 shocking footage has emerged of two out - of - control adult women yelling at each other and throwing punches on an inner - city train platform			0
believed to have taken place at @entity9 's @entity8 , one female dressed in a blue jumper , black scarf and green cargo pants can be seen marching down the platform			1
' what did you say ! ' the woman in cargo pants yells at a lady wearing a grey jumper , pink shirt , tight black pants and what look to be legwarmers			0
then all of a sudden the woman in legwarmers lashes out and pushes the one in cargo pants backwards so she ends up sprawled on the train tracks			2
one woman wearing cargo pants approached another in legwarmers and the pair started to scream at each other one woman pushes the other onto the train tracks after she took a swing at her , before doing a strange victory dance on the platform an arrogant victory dance then takes place and the woman still standing screams ' do n't f * * * with me - boom ! ' the man who filmed the encounter can hardly contain his amusement , and throughout the ordeal provides some commentary , while at other times simply bursts into laughter			1
as the woman in the cargo pants tries to climb back onto the platform , the other female takes a swing at her with her leg in attempt to keep her down			1
then as she tries to kick her opponent to keep her down she falls herself however it 's all downhill from there as the force of her own kick sends the legwarmer wearing lady flying down onto the train tracks as well			2
both women then stand up next to each other , still on the train tracks looking rather puzzled at what just unfolded			0
it is unclear what followed at the video finishes but it seems they both escaped and injury by a train , despite how disastrous the results could have been .			0

one takes the first swing before she is pushed onto the tracks
the second woman then tries to kick the other female to keep her down but falls onto the tracks herself
