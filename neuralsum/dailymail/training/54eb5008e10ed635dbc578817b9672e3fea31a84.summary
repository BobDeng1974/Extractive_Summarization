by @entity0 published : 18:50 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 21:20 est , 12 march 2014 read the @entity4 2 - 1 @entity3 match report here some things are a bit different at @entity4 these days			1
others , like @entity8 stay exactly the same			1
‘ how have you gone from the @entity15 house to the haunted house ? ’ was one of the more imaginative questions asked of @entity4 defender @entity11 at the club ’s training ground on tuesday			2
@entity11 did n’t really have much of an answer to that one			0
to be fair to him , he probably did n’t really understand it			0
still here : some things never change ... like @entity8 's class he will lead us to glory : @entity4 and @entity25 team - mate @entity11 sung his praises on tuesday he did , however , have something to say when asked to pick up on another popular narrative of the times in @entity30 , namely the supposed decline of @entity8			1
that ’s @entity8 of almost a goal a game for club and country this season , by the way			1
‘ @entity39 is a leader , ’ he said			0
‘ he is trying to make us achieve in as many competitions as possible			1
with him , we can do it			0
’ what else would @entity11 say ? he is hardly likely to sit there and suggest that @entity8 should be bundled on to the next plane to @entity46			2
nevertheless , just as it is ridiculous to expect one footballer to criticise another in such a public forum , so it is to suggest that @entity8 ’s time at the @entity53 may be short			2
certainly the explosive , astonishing episodes that illuminated @entity8 ’s season in @entity57 last time round have been thinner on the ground this time			2
just as @entity4 have at times lacked a little sparkle , so has he			2
no 1 : @entity8 was back to his brilliant best on wednesday night , tormenting @entity3 from start to finish new star : he has had to share the limelight with @entity66 , but the pair dovetailed magnificently at the @entity53 delight : @entity8 dinks the ball over @entity70 in the @entity3 goal not quite : @entity70 could do nothing to stop the beautifully executed chip @entity8 has overtaken @entity74 as the top @entity76 scorer with a single club ... @entity78 67 2 @entity79 3 @entity80 46 ( @entity74 scored five goals with @entity82 so is still top overall ) maybe it is the passing of time that is to blame			1
that is unlikely , though			0
the four - time winner of the @entity87 is only 26			0
more likely it has been the presence of a new forward partner , the @entity90 @entity66			0
whatever the case , there was little sign of personal decline here on wednesday night			0
@entity4 could have been three goals up in half - an - hour or so and @entity8 was at the heart of most of what was dangerous about @entity100 ’s team			1
the tackle and foul he drew from @entity102 in the opening stages was typical			0
show the opponent the ball and then make it disappear as the challenge arrives			0
the @entity3 defender fouled @entity8 and should have been punished with a penalty but the referee did n’t see it			1
that ’s always been the problem with @entity8			2
he sucks defenders into making challenges that seem like a good idea at the time			0
more often than not , though , flailing legs find only fresh air — or his ankles			0
too quick : he ought to have had a penalty when @entity102 brought him down in the box early on despair : a tackle often seems like a good idea at the time ... on a night when @entity3 spent long periods looking comfortable , they looked distinctly less so whenever @entity8 had the ball			1
twice he played in @entity66 for good opportunities in the first half , while @entity130 should have scored when his team - mate slipped an exquisite ball through to him			0
in the second half , one of @entity8 ’s familiar lateral forays — it ’s simply too dangerous to tackle him once he reaches the penalty area — saw him strike the inside of the post			1
in that particular instance he looked as dangerous as ever			2
the beauty of his football , and of @entity4 ’s , has always been in its simplicity			2
when the @entity145 champions play at their best it is like watching a five - a - side team			0
when @entity4 did click last night this is how they did it			2
@entity8 ’s goal , when it eventually came , arrived on the back of a mistake from @entity102 but his execution was clinical			1
torment : @entity8 gave @entity102 and @entity156 a torrid evening , running at them and assisting others much love : @entity4 and @entity8 were at their best when they kept it simple , it was like watching a 5 - a - side team support : the fans adore the @entity166 , and it 's little wonder why after displays like this @entity3 , for their part , can count themselves fortunate and unfortunate all at the same time			1
certainly they should have been at least one goal down early on			0
@entity8 should have had his penalty while @entity66 ’s early ‘ goal ’ was disallowed for an offside that only the officials saw			1
however , there were also periods that saw the @entity180 team worry @entity4			0
unlike the first leg at the @entity183 when @entity3 could only unsettle @entity4 on the break , they saw enough of the ball last night to create opportunities at their own pace			1
before the game , @entity3 ’s @entity156 suggested that one goal could ‘ change the dynamic ’			1
that goal almost arrived when substitute @entity190 twice worried @entity191 early in the second half			0
ultimately , despite the sides grabbing a goal apiece just before the end , the superior team prevailed , as we always thought they would			0
@entity4 and @entity8 are not ready to drift into obscurity just yet			1
click here to see all the stats from the game outclassed : @entity8 's stats in the first alf of the game in comparison to @entity3 front man @entity205 ever present : @entity8 picked up the ball and ran at the @entity3 defence consistently old friend : @entity8 embraces with former team - mate @entity209 after the final whistle			1

@entity8 is trying to make @entity4 achieve in many competitions
he looked as dangerous as ever against @entity3
the execution for his goal was clinical , he looked back to his best
@entity4 reach the @entity76 quarter - finals at @entity3 's expense
