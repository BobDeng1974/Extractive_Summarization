it does n’t matter whether it is a human child crying , or the call of a lost fawn : mammals know a young creature in need when they hear it			2
a study has found that the sound of a crying child is recognised and acted upon by wild deer			0
during tests , wild mule and white - tailed deer ran to the rescue of distress calls made by various mammals including humans , cats and even infant silver - haired bats			1
during tests , wild mule ( stock image pictured ) and white - tailed deers responded equally to the cries of their own fawns as those of humans , cats and even infant silver - haired bats			1
researchers wanted to test the theory that mammal mothers can recognise the distress call of any infant , regardless of species the researchers wanted to test the theory that a mammal mother 's instinct can recognise calls of any infant , regardless of species			1
previous studies have found that humans react to the distress calls of their own children , but also infant pets such as dog and cats			1
the same has been found for domestic dogs , who have been known to react to the cries of newborn humans			0
however , in both instances , it was assumed this was as a result of the domestication of these animals			0
researchers from @entity59 claim the findings of the deer study may explain why the frequency of distress calls differs among mammals - to make it easier for species to identify each other			1
a recent study found that humans have evolved to look physically different from each other , for a similar reason			0
researchers from @entity73 explained that most animal species use smell or sound to identify each other - but people rely primarily on sight to differentiate individuals			0
many animals are visually almost indistinguishable from each other , particularly those which are active at night			0
but humans have developed to be physically unique , according to the new research , giving rise to a wide variety in hair colours , eye pigmentation , height and facial features			0
to see if this theory rang true among wild animals , @entity91 of the @entity92 in @entity59 and @entity93 from @entity94 in @entity95 , @entity97 record the cries of various infant mammals			2
this included humans , fur seals , cats , dogs , young yellow - bellied marmots , sea lions , domestic cats , silver - haired bats , and several other deer species			1
they also recorded more generic animal sounds such as birdsong and coyotes barking			0
each of these recordings were played using hidden speakers to wild female mule and white - tailed deers in @entity59 , while researchers monitored the deer ’s behaviour from afar			1
the calls were played as they would normally be heard , as well as at various altered pitch levels			0
a positive response was recorded if the deer approached the speaker , which is similar to how they would react if their own fawn was crying			2
when the frequency of the individual calls was similar to that of a young mule deer , the female would approach the speaker - regardless of which mammal the cry belonged to			1
the female deer came within 32 ft ( 10 metres ) of the speaker , indicating a stronger response , when the calls of seals , marmots , and other deer species were played			1
she came within 82ft ( 25 metres ) during the calls of sea lions , bats and humans			0
however , she did n’t approach when the pitch fell outside the range of her fawn ’s call			0

the deers came within 32ft ( 10 metres ) of the speaker during the calls of fur seals ( left ) , marmots ( right ) and other deer species the deers came within 82ft ( 25 metres ) during the calls of sea lions , cats bats and humans			1
however , they did n’t approach when the pitch fell outside the range of her fawn ’s call to test whether she was simply responding to pitch , rather than the type of call , the researchers then played the generic noises			2
in every instance , the female deer did not react to these control sounds , even when they were played at the same pitch as the fawn ’s call , suggesting the mothers could distinguish between the two types of noises			2
‘ acoustic structure , behavioural context , and caregiver responses to infant distress cries are similar across mammals , including humans , ’ said the researchers			1
‘ our results suggest that acoustic traits of infant distress vocalisations that are essential for a response by caregivers , and a caregiver ’s sensitivity to these acoustic traits , may be shared across diverse mammals			0
they also state that the results could explain why the frequency of distress calls differs among mammals , to make it easier for species to identify each other			1
the findings are published in the journal @entity214			0

researchers from @entity59 recorded the cries of various baby mammals
this included humans , fur seal pups , *kittens* , silver - haired bats and deers
recordings were played to female mule and white - tailed deers in the wild
the research team monitored how the adult deer reacted to each cry
she responded to the cries of humans , fur seals and cats , when they were played at similar pitches to her own fawn
she did *n't* respond to *non-infant* calls , such as birdsong , at the same pitch
findings suggest mammals recognise distress calls , regardless of species
