by @entity1 reporter published : 16:28 est , 17 august 2013 updated : 10:35 est , 18 august 2013 sales of liquor are to be restricted on @entity6 bases to try to reduce sexual assaults and other crimes , the leading admiral has said			1
chief of naval operations admiral @entity9 has ordered a series of changes to the way alcohol is sold on bases , including a ban on sales in its mini marts and restricted selling times at other stores			1
' it 's not going to fix everything , but it is a real step in the right direction , ' @entity20 , @entity21 's director of the @entity22 , said			2
last orders : sailors will be restricted from buying alcohol overnight on bases ' historically , the military , as elsewhere , has viewed these problems as individual problems to be dealt with by identifying the individual with the problem			1
while that 's important , the research shows it 's much more effective actually to look at it as a population problem and to deal with things that are affecting everybody across the population , ' he said			2
the changes , which include not selling alcohol between 10pm and 6am , are the latest addition to a broader alcohol education and awareness program that appears to have had some success			2
throughout the @entity6 , the number of alcohol - related criminal offenses dropped from 5,950 in 2007 to 4,216 last year			1
the number of @entity54 offenses dropped from 2,025 to 1,218 during that same period , according to @entity55			1
liquor will still be sold on @entity58 bases at a discount of up to 10 per cent for what it can be bought at a regular store , but sales will be limited to dedicated package stores or exchanges that sell a variety of items			1
at @entity68 , the main exchange is comparable to a small shopping mall that sells clothing , electronics and jewelry , among other things , at a discount			2
at smaller naval bases , the exchanges are not as sprawling but still often have the feel of big - box retail			1
while hours at those stores vary , most are open between 9am and 9pm			0
restricted : alcohol will be stacked at the back of the building in larger stores on bases , such as the @entity86 in @entity68 , @entity87 the @entity6 's minimarts at the @entity68 base currently start selling liquor as early as 6am - four hours earlier than people can buy it at @entity87 's state - run @entity93 stores off - base			1
mr @entity20 said a preference among young people for distilled spirits over beer and wine means the @entity6 's moves could be helpful			1
' reducing the availability of one kind [ of alcohol ] is a step in the right direction , but you can certainly get just as impaired from drinking beer and wine as you can from distilled spirits , ' he said			1
last year , the @entity6 reported $ 91.9 million in distilled spirits sales , compared with $ 39.3 million in wine and $ 62.3 million in beer			1
the @entity6 uses 70 per cent of the profits from its sales of alcoholic and non-alcoholic products to support morale , welfare and recreation programs			0
admiral @entity9 has ordered the exchanges to display alcohol only in the rear of its stores			0
the new rules are set to take effect by october			1
his order on alcohol sales was issued the same day last month that the @entity6 announced other initiatives to prevent sexual assaults			0
measures include hiring more criminal investigators and installing better lighting on bases			1
the effort follows a @entity136 report , released in may , that estimated as many as 26,000 service members may have been sexually assaulted last year			1
curbed : the @entity6 is trying to restrict access to beer and other drinks to reduce crimes alcohol is often involved			0
in a survey , 55 per cent of @entity6 women said they or the offender had consumed alcohol before unwanted sexual contact			0
@entity6 officials said they were not trying to keep sailors from drinking rather , they wanted them to do so responsibly			2
the @entity6 is already holding random alcohol - detection tests when sailors report for duty , and soon the devices will be found on store shelves for personal use			0
the single - use product will sell for $ 1.99			2
mr @entity20 suggested the @entity6 may want to end discounts for alcohol , just as it did with tobacco			0
not all sailors believe the new rules will help			2
' if people are going to drink , they 're still going to buy it wherever , ' seaman @entity164 told @entity167 , as he bought a bottle of vodka from a @entity68 gas station			0
' so if they take it out of here , it 's not going to do nothing because they 're going to go to the package store right out of base			0
that 's usually where everybody gets it			0
so it does n't really matter			0
' variety : currently sailors are able to buy a wide range of drinks and other goods at base stores , such as the @entity189 in @entity68 @entity190 , a @entity191 sociology professor who has studied the links between alcohol and crime , said restricting on - base alcohol sales should help even if there are places to buy it nearby			0
' if you make something like alcohol harder to get , you restrict the hours , you restrict the places it can be bought , then generally consumption goes down in that community or that area because people have a lot of things to do in addition to buying alcohol , ' he said			0
' there will be some individuals that will be determined no matter what , and they 'll travel 100 miles to buy a six pack , but most people wo n't do that , ' he added .			0
