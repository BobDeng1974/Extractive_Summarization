by @entity0 @entity1 , chief executive of @entity2 , said there are different views on whether the @entity6 qualification should be kept sweeping reforms to school exams could lead to elite a-levels with a tougher grading scale so universities can identify the brightest pupils			1
the new - style tests would be given a different set of grades to enable tutors and employers to tell them apart from existing exams			1
the reforms would effectively create a two - tier system ; old - style a-levels and new versions with beefed - up content , a greater emphasis on essay - writing and a strict limit on exam resits			1
the move comes after the headmaster of a leading public school criticised current tests as ‘ mindless “ satnav ” a-levels ’ that did little to inspire pupils and teachers			0
the new a-levels would be phased in subject by subject over four years , with traditional disciplines likely to be prioritised			1
by 2018 , all old - style a-levels would be scrapped			1
one of the biggest changes in the proposals , unveiled by exams watchdog @entity2 yesterday , is an overhaul of the current six - point a * to e grading scale			1
gradual grade inflation has led some universities to complain they struggle to identify the brightest applicants from an increasingly well - qualified field			1
alternative grading systems could involve a mixture of both marks and grades , with students given percentages alongside an overall grade			0
however , @entity2 admitted its shake - up would need to ensure there was no discrimination against candidates who had completed their a-levels under the old system			1
@entity2 said : ‘ this consultation provides an opportunity to revisit the grading structure of a-levels			0
it may be that there are better ways to support university selection and secure appropriate differentiation			0
’ a spokesman for the watchdog added : ‘ we are asking whether there are enough points on the grading scale to offer appropriate differentiation			0
‘ with some subjects being reformed before others , we are asking whether there should be a way to differentiate between new a-levels and those done the old way			0
would it be right to expect employers to check which year exams were taken ? should this be clear from the way that the exams are recorded ? ’ as - levels could be scrapped under plans to reform exams he added that the proposals aimed to ‘ increase the currency ’ of a-levels and improve them ‘ so they are fit for purpose and held in high public regard ’			1
other reforms under consideration include strict rules on the number and mix of essays , multiple - choice questions and in - depth research a-levels should contain in order to stop teachers ‘ playing the system ’ by choosing easy exams			1
universities – instead of civil servants – would decide the content of syllabuses and at least 20 would need to endorse each new qualification before it can be ‘ signed off ’			2
the future of as - levels – which are taken after a year of sixth - form studies and contribute 50 per cent to the overall a-level grade – is also in doubt			2
if a-levels are retained , the opportunities for resitting exams at a later date to inflate final grades would be slashed			2
january exam sittings would be axed and teenagers would be given just one chance to retake , the following summer			2
@entity2 warned that ‘ students do not always treat exams seriously if they know they have the opportunity to resit ’			0
dr @entity136 , master of @entity137 in @entity138 , said : ‘ the proposals are a step in the right direction , in that it would be a move away from the mindless “ satnav ” a-level towards a real test of students ’ abilities and the exams would be more likely to inspire challenging and thoughtful teaching			2
’ however , unions warned against rushing the reforms			0
@entity153 , of the @entity154 , said : ‘ it needs to be said that the volume of change in schools at the moment is overwhelming			0
‘ there is a serious risk that avoidable mistakes will slip in and valuable reforms will be implemented badly in the rush and turbulence			0
