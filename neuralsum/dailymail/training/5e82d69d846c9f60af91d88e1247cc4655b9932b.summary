the court , based in the @entity10 , said @entity0 , 39 , whose current whereabouts are the source of much speculation , had been in contact with them through intermediaries to discuss the possibility of surrendering for trial			0
@entity0 escaped even though his motorcade was hit by a @entity21 air strike as it left @entity22 on oct. 19 , the day before his father died in @entity24			0
praying for salvation : @entity1 has allegedly hired a team of @entity4 mercenaries to smuggle him to safety three of his brothers were killed in the war			1
sources this week reported he had taken refuge with @entity35 nomads , who his family had helped financially in the past , in the borderlands between @entity5 and @entity38			1
the @entity39 befriended desert tribes in @entity38 , @entity41 and other poor former @entity43 colonies in @entity44			1
other @entity4 countries received @entity5 largesse during the 42 - year rule of @entity1 , a self - styled @entity4 ' king of kings '			1
@entity50 military and government representatives held security talks in neighbouring @entity38 with local officials in @entity53 , which has been a way station for other @entity5 fugitives , including another son of @entity57 , @entity58			1
justice : the @entity8 's chief prosecutor @entity60 is keen to bring @entity57 's eldest son to the @entity62 for trial a @entity50 military plane has been spotted at @entity65			1
a top regional official declined to say what the talks with the @entity50 were about , but spoke of escape plans by @entity1 and former @entity5 intelligence chief @entity70 , both wanted by the @entity8 for crimes against humanity			1
' @entity70 is being extricated from @entity41 toward a country that is a non-signatory to the ( @entity8 ) convention			0
i am certain that they will both ( @entity70 and @entity1 ) be extricated by plane , one from @entity41 the other from @entity38 , ' said the official , who asked not to be named			1
he said there were at least 10 airstrips in the north of @entity38 near the @entity5 border that could be used to whisk @entity1 out of the country			1
however , a member of parliament from northern @entity41 , @entity88 , denied @entity70 or @entity1 were in his country and said they would not be accepted if they tried to enter			1
the arrival of the @entity50 delegation followed remarks by @entity95 , president of @entity96 , who said he would give @entity1 refuge			2
' @entity5 and @entity38 are brother countries and cousins ... so we will welcome him in , ' he said			2
the @entity8 has warned @entity1 , who is understandably anxious not to be captured by @entity5 interim government forces in whose hands his father was brutally killed last week , that it could order a mid-air interception if he tried to flee by plane from his @entity107 desert hideout for a safe haven			1
@entity8 prosecutor @entity60 said : ' there are some people connected with him that are in touch with people connected with us ... it 's through intermediaries , ' ' we have some information that there is a mercenary group trying to help him to move to a different country , so we are trying to prevent this activity , ' said @entity60			2
' we are also working with some states to see if we can disrupt this attempt			0
some of them are @entity4 allegedly			0
' on the run : @entity1 gestures to reporters in @entity128 on august 23			2
the @entity8 said he was in ' informal contact ' with them about the possibility of surrenering to stand trial @entity60 said the @entity8 was not making any deal with @entity1 but was explaining through the contacts that he had to face trial because he had been indicted for war crimes			2
' he says he is innocent , ' said the prosecutor			0
@entity43 , a backer of february 's revolt against @entity1 , reminded @entity4 states of their obligations to hand @entity1 over to the international court			1
' we do n't care whether he goes on foot , by plane , by boat , by car or on a camel , the only thing that matters is that he belongs in the @entity8 , ' said @entity153 spokesman @entity152			0
@entity38 , @entity41 , @entity154 and @entity155 , a swathe of arid states to the south of @entity5 , are all signatories to the treaty that set up the @entity8			2
@entity161 , which took in @entity1 's mother , sister , brother @entity164 and half - brother @entity165 , is not a signatory			1
nor is @entity167 or @entity168			0
leaders of @entity5 's @entity170 ( @entity170 ) would like to run their own trials , but acknowledge that their writ barely runs in the deep south			0
@entity21 countries , now winding up a mission that backed the revolt , have expressed little enthusiasm for hunting a few individuals across a vast tract of empty continent			0
@entity1 was once seen as a liberal reformer , architect of a rapprochement with @entity185 states on whom his father waged proxy guerrilla wars for decades			2
but he responded with belligerent rhetoric after the revolt erupted in @entity5			0
the @entity8 accuses him of hiring mercenaries to carry out a plan , worked out with his father and @entity70 , to kill unarmed protesters inspired by ' @entity195 ' uprisings elsewhere			0
@entity38 's government in the capital @entity198 has vowed to meet its @entity8 commitments			1
but 750 km ( 400 miles ) north in a region where cross-border allegiances among @entity35 nomads often outweigh national ties , the picture looks different			1
some of the tens of thousands of people who eke out a living in the @entity107 , roamed by smugglers and nomadic herders , say there would be a welcome for the younger @entity1			2
' we are ready to hide him wherever needed , ' said @entity213 , a resident of @entity53			0
' we are telling the international community to stay out of this business and our own authorities not to hand him over - otherwise we are ready to go out on to the streets and they will have us to deal with			0
' a @entity50 military aircraft flew 25 wounded @entity170 fighters out of @entity128 on saturday for medical treatment in the @entity50			0
