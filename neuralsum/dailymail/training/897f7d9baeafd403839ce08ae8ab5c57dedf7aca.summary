@entity7 had n’t worn a dress since her wedding day in 1993 when she married husband @entity20 , 51 , but she ’s now become a shadow of her former self after dropping an incredible eight dress sizes			1

' my eating habits have changed completely , and it ’s all about mind over matter			0
' when i look back at pictures , i feel like a different person			0
' i still do n’t think of myself as skinny , but my seven - year - old niece does n’t recognise the old me , and that makes me feel skinny			1
' it took an appointment with a skin consultant for it to hit home with @entity7 that she needed to do something about her weight			1
@entity7 pictured in the summer 2013 , during her battle to lose half of her body weight @entity7 and her husband @entity20 on their wedding day in 1993 , then a size 16 she said : ' i was under investigation for a skin problem and i had to take my top off to show him my skin			1
' that ’s what sparked it , and i knew i had to do something			0
the hospital was sorting my skin out and my health was starting to suffer			2
' i was wearing anything black or dark - coloured and elasticated , and there was no way you would catch me in anything where my legs were on show			2
' i had weight problems from being a teenager but after i had my children the weight piled on over about a year or so and there was no incentive to lose it because i was stuck at home			2
' despite being a size 16 when she got married more than two decades ago , @entity7 ’s weight gradually increased until she was buying size 26 clothes			1
she tried numerous shock diets and in a matter of months lost four stone , but it was a quick fix so within months she put the weight straight back on			2
@entity7 , here with her son @entity93 , then 15 , on her 40th @entity94 promised herself she would ditch her unhealthy habits and excess weight to avoid being ' fat at 40 ' desperate to tackle her excess bulge , @entity7 joined @entity28 with her sister , and soon began to shed the pounds through the @entity100 plan ' i was losing on average about four pounds a week , ' she said			1
' i ’d set myself little goals so i had something to aim for and i started doing things for charity as a way to start keeping fit			0
' i stopped eating so much fatty food and started eating fresher meals and cutting down on my portion sizes , and my stomach shrunk			0
' her success quickly showed , and @entity7 , an administrator , started receiving compliments on her slim new figure			2
@entity116 5ft 3in @entity7 said : ' before i started losing weight , i did n’t want to draw attention to myself , but now my confidence is unbelievable			1
' i was very shy because i was worried if i said something stupid or acted silly while out with my friends that people would just laugh at me because i was fat			2
' but now i will approach people that i ’ve never met before rather than just sticking to people i know			0
' and @entity7 began to notice the change in herself as she quickly moved through the dress sizes , now wearing a size 10			1
@entity7 started eating fresher meals and cutting down on my portion sizes , dropping half her body weight meaning her sons @entity93 , 17 , and @entity133 , 13 , can now pick her up she said : ' i was always having to replace my wardrobe to keep up with the weight loss , and the amount of stuff i ’ve given to charity is unbelievable because things just do n’t look right when they ’re baggy			1
' i can buy clothes which are actually in style now , and my feet have gone from a size six to a size four - and - a - half as well			2
' it feels really good , and all of my friends and family have been so supportive			0
' my boys @entity93 , 17 , and @entity133 , 13 , have helped me and we go running together or to the gym			0
' i ’ve got more energy than them and my husband put together now ! ' where as @entity7 would binge on sandwiches with mayonnaise and butter , chicken and chips and burgers before , she now prefers a diet of lean meat and vegetables with a low - calorie hot chocolate for a treat			1
@entity7 added : ' do n’t get me wrong , i do still eat a big bag of @entity170 on a thursday after @entity28 but i can control my diet for the rest of the week , and you ’re not supposed to deprive yourself			1
' i eat soup , i drink lots of green tea and i do a lot of walking			0
' i only have potatoes once a week and i find it very easy to say no now , plus i weigh everything and make sure my portion is smaller than i give to @entity20 and the boys			0
' i 'm really pleased			0
i would never put the weight back on , and people say that if i can do it , anyone can do it			0
just by small changes you can make a big difference			0
' @entity7 ’s slimming club leader , @entity193 , said : ' @entity7 is an inspiration to anyone losing weight			1
i have got to know her and was so proud of her when she reached her goal			0
' the support she has given to other members has been amazing , encouraging them to join her at swimming or walking outside of the meetings			0
she provides ideas , recipes , and motivation in the meeting and on our @entity209 page and we are lucky to have her as part of our family			0
