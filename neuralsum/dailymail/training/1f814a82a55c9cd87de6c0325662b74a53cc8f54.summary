fraud : cheats are costing the taxpayer £ 200m a year by forging prescription forms fraudsters who claim free prescriptions they are not entitled to face strict checks in a crackdown designed to save the @entity9 millions			1
the move follows the revelation that prescription fraud costs the taxpayer more than £ 200 million a year – enough to pay for some 10,000 nurses			2
cheats get free medicines by pretending to belong to the categories of people exempt from charges			1
children , pensioners and those with certain long - term medical conditions do not have to pay the £ 8.05 charge that is standard in @entity25			1
those paid @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 are also exempt			2
to avoid the charge , patients simply tick a box on the back of the form declaring they are entitled to free medicines			1
pharmacists are meant to ask for proof but many feel uncomfortable doing so			0
if a patient does not have written proof , the pharmacist ticks another box saying ‘ evidence not seen ’			2
very few people are thought to be caught for cheating – so the millions who should pay but avoid doing so know they have a high chance of getting away with it			1
professor @entity47 , director of the @entity48 at @entity49 , said : ‘ people think it ’s a soft touch			2
‘ the man in the street thinks , “ do i know anyone who ’s got caught for prescription fraud ? no. ” ’ an insider said that pharmacists will now be forced to check claimants ’ credentials – or risk having their @entity9 contracts revoked			2
the source said : ‘ pharmacists ’ @entity9 contracts specifically state they are obliged to check a patient is entitled to free prescription medicines			0
’ patients could even be denied free medicines until they prove entitlement			0
‘ that option has not been ruled out as too radical , as long as safeguards were put in place to protect vulnerable groups , ’ the source added			0
both ideas will meet strong resistance from pharmacists , who are opposed to prescription charges in principle and do not think it is their job to ‘ police ’ the system			0
the @entity83 believes prescription charges – which have been abolished in @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 – ‘ act as a barrier to people accessing life - saving medicines ’			1
it wants them abolished for all people with long - term medical conditions			1
system : patients have to simply tick a box on the back of the form - pretending to be a child or elderly - and they can avoid the charge ( file picture ) patients who do get fined usually only have to pay £ 40 – five times the prescription fee			1
the maximum fine is just £ 100			0
the cost of prescription fraud jumped from £ 47 million in 2006 , to £ 100 million in 2008 and £ 216 million in 2013 , according to @entity9 figures			0
some 900 million prescription items were given out for free on the @entity9 in @entity25 last year – 90 per cent of the total			1
some 25 million of those were claimed fraudulently			0
a spokesman for the @entity114 said : ‘ fraud against the @entity9 can have a serious impact on our ability to deliver high quality health services			0
we expect all appropriate sanctions and recovery action to take place			0

those who are exempt avoid paying £ 8.05 fee that is standard in @entity25
patients simply tick the box to side - step the charge on the back of a form
very few people are caught - meaning high numbers can get away with it
