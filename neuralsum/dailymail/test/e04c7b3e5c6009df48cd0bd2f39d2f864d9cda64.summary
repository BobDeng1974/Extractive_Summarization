the @entity0 is one of the icons of the @entity3 - a self - contained and sufficient town buried under the @entity5 meant to be impervious to a @entity7 nuclear barrage			1
it was home to the @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , scanning the skies for @entity14 missiles and the military command and control center of the @entity16 in the event of @entity18			2
the high tech base entered popular culture with appearances in the 1983 @entity3 thriller @entity22 and 1994 's @entity24 - which imagined the complex as a clandestine home for intergalactic travel			1
the shift to the @entity0 base in @entity30 is designed to safeguard the command 's sensitive sensors and servers from a potential electromagnetic pulse ( @entity59 ) attack , military officers said			2
the @entity46 last week announced a $ 700 million contract with @entity61 to oversee the work for @entity10 ( @entity11 ) and @entity63			0
admiral @entity64 , head of @entity11 and @entity63 , said that ' because of the very nature of the way that @entity0 's built , it 's @entity59 - hardened			2
' power : at its height @entity0 was home to @entity11 who watched 7,000 aircraft per day as part of their surveillance operations headquarters : the @entity16 and @entity78 military jointly operated @entity11 from within @entity0 and soldiers from north of the border made up 15 percent of the personnel at the base around - the - clock crews monitor @entity16 skies from the command center of the @entity63 located deep within @entity0 at the foot of the @entity5 near @entity87 , @entity30 in 2002 ' and so , there 's a lot of movement to put capability into @entity0 and to be able to communicate in there , ' @entity64 told reporters			1
' my primary concern was ... are we going to have the space inside the mountain for everybody who wants to move in there , and i 'm not at liberty to discuss who 's moving in there , ' he said			0
the @entity0 bunker is a half - acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a @entity7 nuclear attack			1
from inside the massive complex , airmen were poised to send warnings that could trigger the launch of nuclear missiles			0
but in 2006 , officials decided to move the headquarters of @entity11 and @entity63 from @entity0 to @entity116 air force base in @entity87			2
the @entity0 bunker was designated as an alternative command center if needed			2
almost 10 years ago , the military closed the secretive defense complex carved into @entity0 that for decades monitored @entity16 skies for threats			1
the @entity11 operations center was moved to nearby @entity124 , which is home to the @entity63 created after the sept. 11 attacks			0
@entity0 is 2,000 feet below the granite rocks and made up of 15 three - story buildings protected from nuclear blasts and seismic movement by a system of 1,000 giant springs			1
the entire complex is designed to withstand a direct hit by a 30 megaton nuclear explosion and has 25 - ton blast doors surrounding the complex			1
@entity11 , a joint @entity16 and @entity78 command , was set up in the 1960s to monitor the skies for threats like missiles , aircraft and space objects			0
in 2006 , adm. @entity144 , who commanded both @entity11 and the @entity63 , said the government 's best intelligence ' led them to believe a missile attack from @entity148 or @entity14 was very unlikely			0
' @entity3 heroes : the @entity0 bunker is a half - acre cavern carved into a mountain in the 1960s that was designed to withstand a @entity7 nuclear attack that , along with the emergence of varied terrorist threats such as suicide bombers , ' was why we recommended that we do n't need to maintain @entity0 in a 24/7 status			1
we can put it on ` warm standby , ' said @entity144			0
about 1,100 people work in the mountain , long a symbol of the @entity3			0
buildings inside it are mounted on springs to absorb the shock from a nuclear blast , while the entrance is guarded by a vault - like door several feet thick			1
the complex includes banks of batteries and its own water supply			0
excavation on the site began in 1961			0
@entity78 crews stationed at @entity0 will also made the move to @entity124 , @entity144 said			0
@entity179 : @entity24 ( 1994 ) was set inside the @entity0 while 1983 's @entity22 also imagine a nuclear standoff operated from inside the nuclear bunker that move was touted a more efficient use of resources but had followed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of modernization work at @entity0 carried out after the attacks of september 11 , 2001			1
now the @entity46 is looking at shifting communications gear to the @entity0 bunker , officials said			2
' a lot of the back office communications is being moved there , ' said one defense official			0
officials said the military 's dependence on computer networks and digital communications makes it much more vulnerable to an electromagnetic pulse , which can occur naturally or result from a high - altitude nuclear explosion			1
under the 10 - year contract , @entity61 is supposed to deliver ' sustainment ' services to help the military perform ' accurate , timely and unambiguous warning and attack assessment of air , missile and space threats ' at the @entity0 and @entity116 bases			1
@entity61 's contract also involves unspecified work at @entity213 in @entity214 and @entity215 in @entity216 .			0

@entity0 being *refurbished* by @entity218
high tech communications being *installed* that are impervious to electromagnetic pulses
the bunker is build under 2,000 feet of the @entity5 and is able to withstand a hit by a 30 megaton nuclear blast
*decommissioned* 10 - years ago because ' the @entity14 were no longer a threat '
