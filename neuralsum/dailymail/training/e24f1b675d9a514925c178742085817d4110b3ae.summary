@entity0 , the divorcee who attacked her £ 20million court settlement as a ' mockery ' , has also branded herself a champion of women 's rights , and her ex-husband as a man of ' no feeling '			1
the 49 - year - old , who was hoping for £ 300million plus expenses , conceded that to some it may seem like a fortune but insists her case exposes how people fall through the net in family law			1
she also attacked her husband for cruelly forcing one of their daughters into state education			1
her comments come at the end of a seven - year legal battle on thursday , from which she emerged glaring			1
battle : @entity0 , here with daughters @entity27 and @entity28 , claims she is doing this for women 's rights despite telling the court she needed enough money to buy a £ 25million mansion in @entity37 ’s exclusive @entity36 , a judge ruled that ‘ fixer for the super-rich ’ @entity41 , 51 , would have to give his wife £ 20million			1
she had hoped to walk away with a nine - figure pay out from the man she refers to as ' mr @entity41 ' , who the judge ruled had hidden £ 45million from the court			1
today she told @entity46 : ' i have made a stand for women			1
' my case has exposed the woeful shortcomings of the family law system			1
' i do n't want to go through this for nothing , i want to see the law changed to protect women like me with children by men who conveniently find they suddenly have no assets when they want to go off with a younger woman			1
' i think and hope this case is making history			2
' warring : @entity41 , left , and his estranged wife @entity63 , right , pictured arriving at the @entity64 in @entity37 on thursday			1
she has always maintained that her husband , ' a fixer for the super-rich ' , was hiding his assets blasting ' mr @entity41 ' as ' emotionless ' , she attacked him for driving one of their two daughters into state education when she could no longer afford the £ 5,375 - a - term fees for @entity74 in @entity37			1
the mother and two daughters , @entity77 , 21 , and @entity27 , 19 , have moved into a two - bedroom flat partly paid for by housing benefit			2
@entity27 and mrs @entity0 share a room			1
it has been a tough battle for the family learning to travel by @entity83 and shop at markets			1
she said : ' if you loved your children , you would n't do this sort of thing to them , no matter what he says about loving them			0
when i see him it makes my skin crawl			0
' however , in the final hearing this week , the judge launched a scathing attack on both @entity101 as parents , saying he felt ‘ nothing but sympathy ’ for their two children , and criticising the warring couple for failing to be ‘ child - focused ’			0
in his ruling , mr @entity108 said : ‘ it is undoubtedly the most difficult financial remedy case i have ever come across			0
‘ this case has been extraordinary even by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns			0
extremely serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti			0
‘ some of these allegations can only be described as “ wild ”			0
the case has cost the wife millions in litigation fees			0
‘ in many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as i have encountered			0
’ he finished by saying : ‘ finally , i feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties			0
through no fault of their own , their parents ’ marriage broke down			0
‘ a marital breakdown is distressing enough for any child , but for the divorce to then be played out in the full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them			0
‘ what has occurred has not been child - focused			0
i truly hope that the parents will reflect on this			0
i hope it does not happen to any other children			0
’ speaking outside the court , mrs @entity0 – who has been refusing to finalise the divorce until the finances are resolved – said : ‘ it is a disgrace			1
i stand by what i said			2
life of luxury : @entity0 , pictured on the runway in @entity155 with @entity41 and their daughter after their flight on @entity159			1
she told the trial they went on four exotic holidays a year i feel nothing but sympathy for the two children			0
this must have been absolutely appalling for them mr @entity108 ‘ many people will be watching this and think it ’s a fortune but all this order is is a piece of paper			2
not for my two daughters and not for mr @entity41			1
’ asked about his wife ’s reaction to the ruling , mr @entity41 said : ‘ disgraceful ? that was my wife ’s quote was it ? no comment			2
’ mrs @entity0 had demanded half her husband ’s assets , claiming that he was worth ‘ a few billion pounds at least ’ but had hidden away his cash in a series of secret investments			1
he was said to have created a business structure called ‘ @entity193 ’ to hide assets from his wife as their marriage hit the rocks			2
luxury lifestyle : @entity195 in @entity196 is just one of the properties belonging to @entity41 five star family fun : @entity41 and @entity63 with daughters @entity27 and @entity28 on holiday in the @entity202 in 2000 wedding day : @entity41 and @entity0 signing a marriage register in 1995 wronged : @entity0 has been forced to pursue her estranged husband through the courts for years , claiming that he tried to avoid reaching a divorce settlement moving on : @entity41 pictured his model and tv presenter girlfriend @entity209 after employing 13 sets of lawyers and four teams of accountants , she remains convinced that property tycoon mr @entity41 ’s claims of bankruptcy are ‘ lies ’			1
but handing down his ruling , mr @entity108 said : ’ doing as best as i can , i find that he still has £ 45million hidden from this court			2
‘ the wife is entitled to a lump sum of £ 20million			0
i can see no reasons why the husband should not pay the sum quickly – i therefore order him to pay within 28 days			2
’ he added : ‘ i have rejected all the more fanciful allegations made against him			2
‘ i can not see how he would have complied with an order for a lump sum of £ 300million let alone £ 400million			0
i hope that he will take the view that he is better off paying the lower sum of £ 20million so that he can concentrate on rebuilding his life			0
’ after beginning their relationship in 1989 and having two daughters , the @entity101 had bought a home in @entity37 , a mansion in @entity196 , luxurious residences around the globe and travelled by private jet			2
but after they separated in 2006 a bitter battle for cash began			0
mr @entity41 offered his wife a £ 300million settlement on 25 august 2009 – but the next year insisted that he had suffered a financial ‘ meltdown ’			2
the court heard a further claim that mr @entity41 had then suggested another offer of £ 27million , saying that ‘ only a greedy cow would refuse that ’			1
by @entity251 this is n't over : speaking outside court today @entity0 said she was furious and branded the judgment ' disgraceful ' they enjoyed a lifestyle known only by the world ’s wealthiest , globe - trotting by private jet between their vast homes			1
inhabiting a world few people can imagine , @entity41 and @entity0 mixed in a superleague of power players			1
but as details of their fantastic riches were aired in court during one of @entity272 ’s most acrimonious and colourful divorce battles , perhaps the most eyebrow - raising moment was the revelation of the largesse of mr @entity41 ’s friends after the marriage fell apart			1
in a statement to the court , retail tycoon sir @entity277 said he had loaned mr @entity41 £ 80,000 in 2008 ‘ as a favour ’ to help pay for a @entity283 flat for mrs @entity0			1
restaurateur @entity284 confirmed that he loaned mr @entity41 £ 50,000 as he had known him for many years and wanted to help him through his financial difficulties			2
mrs @entity0 , 49 , sensationally alleged that the two men , along with @entity288 impresario @entity287 and the late @entity290 oligarch @entity289 were involved in a conspiracy to hide her husband ’s assets			1
her bombshell claim to the @entity64 came as she pursued former property developer mr @entity41 for part of the billions of pounds she said he had hidden			1
but mr @entity41 , 51 , said he was left penniless after the collapse of a @entity298 deal that cost him his entire fortune virtually overnight			1
she even alleged her husband was a major shareholder with @entity287 ’s @entity303 show , and added : ‘ i am told i will never find out the truth because these people are wealthy and powerful			0
’ mr @entity41 , a former fixer to the super-rich , told the court his wife ’s claims were those of a ‘ fantasist ’ and rejected her accusation that his friends were ‘ sheltering ’ his money			1
he had met @entity287 fewer than five times and had ‘ never had any business with him ’ , and it was ‘ laughable ’ that he had a secret shareholding @entity303			0
mr @entity41 claimed he had ‘ probably bumped into sir @entity277 in the street once and seen him outside a nightclub once ’ in two years			2
he said he had had no income since 2006 and was living ‘ with the support of friends ’			0
sir @entity277 , mr @entity287 , mr @entity284 and mr @entity289 , who was found hanged at his @entity329 mansion earlier this year , all dismissed her allegations of a conspiracy			0
in his ruling yesterday , the judge said that he ‘ entirely and unreservedly ’ accepted the evidence given to the court by sir @entity277 and mr @entity284 about their loans to mr @entity41			1
before their split , the couple lived in unimaginable luxury			0
they owned six mansions in @entity36 , @entity272 ’s most exclusive postcode , and the family home was £ 21million @entity195 in @entity196 , described as ‘ @entity345 in miniature ’			0
they also had a £ 3.5million beach house in @entity349 , a yacht in @entity351 , employed a small army of servants and housekeepers , and dined in the finest restaurants			0
they drove fabulous cars , including two @entity358 worth £ 700,000 each			0
mr @entity41 had a £ 70,000 watch , and said jewellery he bought for his wife ’s 40th cost £ 150,000 .			2

@entity0 claims she made a stand for women and will make history
attacked husband @entity41 for forcing one of their daughters into state *school*
declares she is an example of women falling through the net in family law
she had demanded half her husband @entity41 's assets , maintaining he was worth ' a few billion at least ' but had hidden away ' a vast fortune '
speaking outside court she described her *lengthy* legal battle as ' a desperate struggle for me and my daughters '
@entity390 husband made ' mockery of justice system ' , *vowing* ' this is not over '
