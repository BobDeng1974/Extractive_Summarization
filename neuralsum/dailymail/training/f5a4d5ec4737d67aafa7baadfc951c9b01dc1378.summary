' @entity0 had won all ten of his previous meetings against @entity5 and never at any point on monday night did it look like this particular contest would end any differently			2
the first break of the match came in the third game with @entity30 champion @entity5 nervously putting a forehand wide as he faced break point			0
two stunning forehand cross-court passes helped @entity0 seal the double break for 4 - 1 and a tame @entity5 backhand into the net ended a 27 - minute first set			1
@entity38 1 @entity0 dominated proceedings throughout on monday night another @entity5 error saw @entity0 claim the early break in the second set , although he did halt the @entity44 's run of eight straight games as he immediately broke back with a blistering forehand down the line			1
hopes of a possible @entity5 revival were swiftly ended , however , as the @entity50 sprayed yet more groundstrokes and @entity0 won four games in a row to seal a comfortable victory			1
two more wins in the round - robin stage for @entity0 will see him secure the year - end no 1 ranking and he looks odds on to do so given his dominance under a roof in the last two years			1
