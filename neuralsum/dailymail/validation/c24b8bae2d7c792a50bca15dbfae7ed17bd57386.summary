@entity1 giant - killers @entity0 finally made it on to live television but viewers were treated to blood - and - thunder rather than a feast of football			1
@entity9 striker @entity8 rightly described it as a ‘ dogfight ’ and the lasting image was blood pouring out of the broken nose of @entity17 centre - half @entity15 in injury - time			1
it was that sort of game			0
‘ no goals , but a classic cup tie , ’ remarked @entity17 boss @entity20 with a smile			2
@entity24 were furious their fifth - round tie against @entity26 was n’t selected by broadcasters despite their remarkable 4 - 2 win at @entity29 in the previous round			1

the woodwork was struck three times — once by @entity24 , twice by @entity17 — but they were rare moments of penalty - area drama			1
championship side @entity17 were determined not to go the same way as @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity29 and @entity26 who have all been beaten by 2013 @entity118 finalists @entity24 in the last few seasons , and @entity20 — who won the @entity1 as a @entity29 player in 1997 — was unapologetic for sticking an extra man in midfield and trying to stifle the game as a contest			1

@entity130 weighed heavily on both teams			0
@entity17 had n’t been to an @entity1 semi-final since 1927			1

with every @entity24 fan arriving with a claret - and - amber scarf , the atmosphere was colourful and noisy			1
crunching tackles by @entity55 and @entity58 could be heard from the back of the stands while @entity64 and @entity8 steamed into any defender that moved			2
not that @entity17 were shrinking violets , @entity29 loanee @entity143 winded @entity58 with his first strong challenge from behind			1
@entity17 took time to come to terms with being in the bearpit but produced a neat bit of football after 18 minutes when @entity77 ’s cross reached @entity84 and the @entity151 spun and struck the post in one movement			1
@entity0 responded with their own opportunity , @entity58 ’s cross-shot deceiving @entity73 and also striking the upright			1
@entity24 's @entity55 has a shot under pressure from @entity17 's @entity79 during their @entity1 quarter - final match @entity24 manager @entity51 yells at the linesman during his side 's @entity1 quarter - final tie against his former club @entity17 reading manager @entity20 ( right ) gives a glance towards @entity51 during the cup game at @entity40 on saturday referee @entity93 got into the @entity1 spirit and let go many challenges that would have been penalised in the @entity170			1

even in injury - time , no quarter was given			2
when @entity15 went up in the air with @entity34 , he clashed heads with the @entity24 man and injured himself in the process			2
play was stopped as blood streamed from @entity15 ’s nose			0
in keeping with the game , he went off to get patched up but came back on to see out time			0
‘ wipe the blood off and back on , he ’s a proper centre - half , ’ said @entity20 , proudly			2
fans got an eyeful as @entity15 stripped down to his underpants along the touchline so he could change his bloodied shirt and shorts as quickly possible before returning to the fray			0

it means @entity24 and @entity17 will play two matches in three days			1

the @entity17 boss admitted his spoiling tactics were devised after watching @entity24 over-run @entity26 at @entity40 last month			1
‘ we knew what to expect , no quarter asked or given , ’ he said			0
@entity51 said : ‘ they came with an extra man in midfield			0
