mr @entity88 said he wanted to ' make each picture count '			1
he explained : ' i did not want the book to be just a collection of stones and crosses but rather wanted to show the cemeteries within the landscape			1
' the @entity16 works in an amazing range of climatic and geographical regions so i wanted show that extent and show the landscapes where these men died			1
' they were all equal places of death and my job was really to reflect the extent of @entity16 work in caring for these graves wherever they may be			1
' the handful of men buried at @entity41 in the @entity114 desert are just as ‘ dead ’ and were just as missed by their families as the mass of men in @entity155			0
' he said the most memorable spot for him was the grave of @entity159 , who is buried alongside his twin brother in the remote hills of @entity96			0
the @entity163 cemetery in @entity164 , off the coast of @entity166 , pictured , is the burial site of @entity169 members , who died during the early part of the @entity5			1

the cemetery is privately owned and is only accessible by boat			0
author of the new book @entity88 said he wanted to make mr @entity88 ' each picture count ' and aims to tell the story behind the cemeteries and about the soldiers and people who are buried there the @entity216 in @entity218 's @entity217 contains 270 @entity5 burials			1
most died in the @entity216 railway disaster , when two trains collided at @entity222 near @entity216 on may 22 , 1915 , killing 210 officers and men of the 1st/7th @entity225 on their way to embark for @entity21			2
victims of the disaster are buried in the @entity229			0
during the war , the port of @entity231 in @entity218 was used by hospital ships from north @entity234 and about 4,500 officers and men passed through it more than 180 men who fell during the @entity5 are buried at @entity239 in @entity240 , pictured , with almost all of them serving in the @entity169			2
the headstone was erected by the people of @entity244 in memory of those died during the @entity246 , a naval battle during 1916 , where the @entity27 defeated the @entity55 forces ' it is a lovely tranquil spot though the farmstead has long been abandoned			0
one can only imagine the happy scene as he returned from the war to be greeted by his family and especially his twin brother , @entity251 ' , explained mr @entity88			2
' and one can only imagine the horror and misery for his mother as he fell sick with influenza and infected his brother : how terrible it must have been for her to watch her two sons , born on the same day , dying on the same day			0
' the @entity265 flu was a vicious killer where you literally drowned in your own bodily fluids and to have this happen in such a remote place , so far from help after the joy of home - coming is such a cruel irony			0
' the book , for @entity277 by photojournalist @entity278 , who visited hundreds of @entity16 sites to bring to life the stories behind them mr @entity88 , who has been documenting battlefields of the @entity5 since 2006 , said he hoped the book would help people realise that the @entity5 was fought far beyond @entity287			1
he added : ' i would like people to realise that the @entity5 was exactly that , namely a @entity202 : we tend to think of it just being in @entity32 but we ignore its territorial range and the collateral loss of life			2
' the loss of life in @entity51 is estimated to have been over one million people largely through famine and disease and it helped generate the terrible pandemic of @entity265 flu			0
' i think that cemeteries tend to ‘ bend ’ history in that it is easy to research and tell the stories of the men in the cemeteries whereas it is often impossible to tell the story of those who survived and never again spoke of their experiences so those who vied are often forgotten about			2
