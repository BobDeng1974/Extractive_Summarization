@entity3 ’s family claim he was not checked enough by overworked staff or given medication when he needed it			1
he was so breathless on admission that he had to be given oxygen and treated with nebulisers , which turn liquid drugs into a spray to be more easily inhaled			1
the inquest heard the ‘ gifted and talented ’ boy , from @entity21 , @entity22 , initially seemed to improve after being given the nebulisers every hour			0
consultant @entity24 then changed this to using an inhaler			2
he said he observed @entity3 for ‘ about 15 - 20 minutes ’ before his decision in march 2009			2
the doctor also did not order an x-ray for a suspected chest infection			1
he admitted @entity3 , who died of a respiratory infection , ‘ did not receive the treatment he should have ’ consultant paediatrician @entity24 said : ' the general impression was that he seemed to be improving			1
' he was alert , he seemed quite comfortable			0
' he seemed reasonably well			0
' i was speaking to his mother about ( @entity3 ) going home			2
' he said he had ordered @entity38 to be treated every two hours with an inhaler , but @entity40 , the deputy coroner for @entity41 and @entity42 , pointed out : ' it does n't say that anywhere in the notes ' , which recorded that @entity3 should have the treatment ever four hours			1
when asked by mr @entity40 why he did not keep @entity3 on the nebulisers , dr @entity24 replied : ‘ i thought he was an older child who would cope well with an inhaler			1
it can be seen as a more gentle treatment			0
' the consultant said he arranged for @entity3 to be reviewed again by a colleague at 3pm , although the coroner again pointed out that ' this was not documented anywhere			1
' the colleague found @entity3 ' did not look as well as he had that morning ' and had needed to be given oxygen to breathe			1
@entity3 was then put back on the nebuliser treatment			2
by 6pm , @entity3 was assessed as needing ‘ frequent ’ observations from medics , but was not seen again until 9pm			2
dr @entity24 agreed that he ‘ would have expected more ’ than three - hourly observations of the boy , given his condition			0
the court heard dr @entity24 also prescribed a course of antibiotics over a ‘ suspicion ’ @entity3 had a chest infection , but did not order a chest x-ray to investigate this further			1
as @entity3 ’s condition worsened , the court heard he needed four doses from the nebuliser over a three - hour period , but only received three			0
@entity75 dr @entity74 told the hearing the youngster had at some point during his treatment suffered a brain injury , which could have caused @entity3 to not respond to treatment as well as he should			0
