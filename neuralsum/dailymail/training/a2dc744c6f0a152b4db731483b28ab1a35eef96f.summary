a senior @entity1 politician has called for @entity2 to be reopened – as a prison for jihadis returning to @entity5 after travelling abroad to fight			1
@entity6 – who stood as a candidate for the @entity1 presidency in 2012 – believes that the former penal colony in @entity10 would be a fitting place for ‘ the madmen ’ who have fought with radical groups such as @entity15 ( @entity16 ) and @entity17			1
the island in @entity1 @entity19 is notorious as the place where @entity1 army officer @entity21 was unjustly held at the end of the @entity23 after being accused of treason , and as the location of the 1973 film @entity27 , starring @entity28 and @entity29			1
it is the latest suggested solution for the problem of what to do with returning jihadis			0
in @entity47 , there have been demands for extremists to be denied re-entry into the country			0
referring to the official name for @entity2 , mr @entity6 said he ‘ proposes the re-establishment of a @entity55 detention centre which would allow us to permanently isolate the madmen ’			1
he insisted the regime would not be like that of the original @entity2 , where tropical disease , starvation and savage beatings were commonplace , but instead the jail would be run in ‘ a humane way ’			1
estimates of the number of @entity1 nationals in @entity68 and @entity69 range from 1,000 to 4,000			1
earlier this month , two of them – @entity71 and @entity72 – appeared in an @entity16 video showing the decapitated bodies of a @entity76 aid worker and 18 @entity68 soldiers			2
in the past two years , two returning @entity1 jihadis have been connected with 11 murders			2
@entity1 nationals @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right , who have appeared in an @entity82 video showing the decapitated bodies of a @entity76 aid worker and 18 @entity68 soldiers such atrocities have guaranteed widespread support for mr @entity6 ’s proposal , with @entity1 @entity89 leader @entity88 saying all returning fighters should be ‘ imprisoned for life ’			1
the fear is they will carry out atrocities in mainland @entity5 , such as those by @entity17 - trained killer @entity96 , who shot dead seven people near @entity98 in 2012 , and @entity99 , who faces trial for the murder of four people at the @entity103 in @entity104 earlier this year			2
a @entity1 @entity106 source in @entity107 told @entity108 : ‘ faced with these kind of events , it is no surprise that people are calling for drastic measures			0
’ the @entity1 government said it was aware of the proposal but has not made an official response			2
the island was the setting for the 1973 film @entity27 , which starred @entity28 and @entity29 the penal colony closed in 1953 and is now run by the @entity124 , a @entity1 and @entity5 research body			1
air marshal sir @entity132 , @entity47 ’s former head of defence intelligence , said : ‘ if the @entity1 are wanting to isolate them and stop them spreading their extremist creed , then you do have to separate the jihadis from the mainstream population			0
you do n’t know how far they have been brainwashed and what they have been taught			0
but reopening @entity2 is a high - risk strategy			0
’ but lord @entity136 , the @entity47 ’s former terrorism legislation watchdog , called the proposal ‘ bonkers ’ and a ‘ daft idea that would be unlawful in the @entity47 ’			0
‘ this is a right - wing idea that one might expect @entity143 to come up with , ’ he said			0
‘ but it has no element of responsibility about it			0

@entity6 says island would be a fitting place for ' madmen '
added it could be a place for those who have fought with @entity82 and @entity17
former @entity1 presidential candidate says plan has widespread support
the @entity55 detention centre was notorious for disease and starvation
but it closed in 1953 and is now run by a @entity1 research body
the island in @entity1 @entity19 was also used in the 1973 film @entity27
comes after two @entity1 nationals appeared in the latest @entity82 video
but *critics* have said the proposal for the former penal colony is ' bonkers '
