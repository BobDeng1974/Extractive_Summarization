the @entity0 , @entity1 police chief in charge of the investigation into the shooting of black teenager @entity5 resigned temporarily on thursday			1
@entity6 , stood down as the outcry over the death of the 17 - year - old , gunned down by a neighborhood watch captain as he went to buy candy , spread across the @entity12			1
it also emerged today that the police officer who first responded to the scene had been previously involved in another racially - charged investigation			2
the officer , @entity17 , was involved in an alleged police cover up of an incident in which the white son of a police lieutenant punched a black homeless man and was never arrested			1
out : police chief @entity23 resigned thursday afternoon amid mounting pressure from the fumbling of the investigation into the shooting death of @entity5 unarmed target : @entity5 , 17 ( pictured left ) was killed by @entity30 , 28 ( right ) after the neighborhood watch captain pursued him as walked in a gated community in @entity1 the resignation of mr @entity6 was the first significant action in the case			1
' i 'm aware that my role as the leader of this agency has become a distraction , ' mr @entity6 said			0
' it is my hope the process would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system , ' he continued			0
his announcement came just hours after the local city commission gave him a vote of no confidence			0
during the wednesday meeting , city commissioner @entity49 said that @entity0 had long had racial tension and the death of @entity5 is hurting any chances of advancement			2
it 's a national embarrassment , ' said ms @entity49 , who is the only black commissioner			1
no confidence : the @entity0 city commission , including @entity49 ( right ) voted that they had no confidence in police chief @entity6 ( left ) and called for him to resign the actions of the @entity60 following the shooting of @entity5 on february 26			1
immediately after they responded to the scene , they took @entity30 back to police headquarters but while there , they did not test him for alcohol or drugs			2
considering he is heard slurring his words on the 911 call , that was a particularly agregious move			0
not only that , but playing into to thoughts of mr @entity30 , the police instead tested @entity5 's dead body for alcohol and drugs			1
they allowed mr @entity30 to leave the police station without pressing any charges			0
and until the very recent press buzz about the case , they proceeded to do no further investigation after that fateful night			0
it has taken almost a month for anything to change in the case , which has upset @entity5 's family and their supporters			1
ms @entity49 nearly fainted after the close vote , which ended up 3 - 2 against mr @entity6 , because she was so emotional			0
the two commissioners that supported mr @entity94 and @entity95 - said that the police chief is essentially being given a trial in the court of public opinion which is unfair			1
the case has caught national attention and brought severe scrutiny to the practices of the @entity0 , @entity1 police department and their murky history of dealing with cases involving racially - motivated crimes			2
in the case involving @entity108 , the police lieutenant 's son , mr @entity17 chose not to press charges against the boy even though he broke the homeless man 's nose			1
mr @entity17 was the one to release the teen from custody			2
there was a video of the incident , and the police chose to cover it up			0
only after local news outlets found out about that cover up did they press charges against the boy			0
though the police chief at the time resigned in the incident 's wake , mr @entity17 was investigated and received a formal complaint			1
including that incident , he has three validated complaints on his file , and another one pending			0
past precedent : police officer @entity17 - the same officer who responded to the @entity5 shooting - was allegedly involved in the cover - up of @entity108 's ( left ) attack on @entity139 ( right ) in 2007 @entity5 's parents held a brief press conference shortly after the news was announced saying that they were not satisfied			1
' the temporary step down of @entity6 is nothing ! ' @entity143 said after meeting with federal investigators to go over the details of the case			0
' i 'm aware that my role as the leader of this agency has become a distraction			0
it is my hope the process would move swiftly and thoroughly through the justice system			0
' - police chief @entity158 ' we want an arrest ! we want a conviction for the murder of my son ! ' he said to crowds of supporters and fans while standing next to @entity168			1
@entity5 's death was memorialized across the country on wednesday and there was a massive march in @entity173 in support of @entity5 's parents who want the shooter , @entity30 , arrested			1
others are taking more pointed action , and a black militia group have announced that they plan to attempt a citizen 's arrest on mr @entity30			1
@entity182 said that they hope to find him and bring him into the custody of federal authorities because they feel that the @entity0 police have not been sufficient			0
wanted man : many , including the parents of slain @entity5 , are demanding the arrest of @entity30 coming together : thousands of protesters , some banding together from other causes , attended the @entity194 in @entity196 's @entity195 on wednesday the latest finding about the involvement of mr @entity17 in both the @entity108 incident and the latest shooting will not reassure them at all			1
' we 'll find him , ' militia leader @entity202 told local @entity204			0
' we have his mugshot and everything			0
' this is exactly the kind of action that @entity5 's parents do not want			1
mr @entity5 and @entity210 have appeared on numerous talk shows and news segments in an effort to publicize the february 26 shooting and put pressure on the police department to arrest mr @entity30			1
while in @entity173 to appear on the @entity218 , the parents heard that a million hoodie march , named so in honor of @entity5 who was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt at the time of his death , and agreed to speak at the initial rally			2
unexpected : @entity143 , pictured , said he and his son 's mother found out about the march after arriving in @entity173 , where they have done interviews about the case the teen 's mother , @entity210 , told the crowd : ' my heart is in pain , but to see the support of all of you really makes a difference			2
' the demonstrators responded : ' @entity242 bless you ! ' the march started in @entity195 and proceeded to splinter off , with some heading north to @entity245 and others headed south to the @entity248 bull statue , much like the @entity250 protesters frequently did			0
' we 're not going to stop until we get justice , ' said the teenager 's father , @entity143 , after thanking the crowd that marched in @entity196			1
' my son did not deserve to die			0
' ' i do n't feel this is the time to break down , even though it 's a very troubling time in my life			0
' i 've told myself , when i get justice for @entity5 , then i 'll have my time to break down			2
' the case is now being reviewed by the @entity265 's civil rights division to address the tension in @entity0			2
the @entity267 has also been sent to reopen the case			0
scene : @entity5 was visiting his father and stepmother in @entity0 where they live at @entity273 , pictured , when he went out to buy snacks for his younger brother @entity1 is among 21 states with a ‘ @entity277 , ’ which gives people wide latitude to use deadly force rather than retreat during a fight			2
the self - defense law helps explain why a neighborhood watch captain @entity30 has not been arrested in the shooting death of an unarmed teenager			1
the @entity1 law lets police officers on the scene decide whether they believe the self - defense claim			0
in many cases , the officer 's defer to making the arrest , letting the courts work out whether the deadly force is justified			2
in this case , however , police have said they are confident they did the right thing by not charging 28 - year - old @entity30 , a white @entity300			2
@entity5 's family questions @entity30 's story , and believes if their races were reversed , there is no doubt a black shooter would be jailed , even if he claimed self - defense			1
‘ they are making it look like @entity30 is the victim and their son is in the grave , ’ said @entity309 , attorney for @entity5 's parents			1
‘ it 's about equal justice			0
’ in a statement released wednesday , @entity0 police chief @entity6 insisted his officers were ‘ prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time , ’ including physical evidence that supported @entity30 's self - defense claim			1
‘ the @entity60 has conducted a complete and fair investigation of this incident , ’ @entity6 said , adding that it 's now up to prosecutors to determine whether to bring charges			0
late wednesday , commissioners in @entity0 , a city of 53,000 people outside @entity336 that is 57 per cent white and 30 per cent black , voted 3 - 2 to express ‘ no confidence ’ in the police chief			1
