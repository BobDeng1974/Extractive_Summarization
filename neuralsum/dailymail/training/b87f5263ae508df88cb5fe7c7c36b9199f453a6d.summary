by @entity0 smog and air pollution are lingering environmental problems in @entity4			1
but a city in the northwestern region is determined to fight against dirty air using nothing more complicated than plain old tap water			2
recently , local residents in @entity11 , capital of northwest @entity13 province , found that two giant sprayers had been set up at the @entity15 where a subway station of the city 's @entity17 is under construction			1
will they see clearly now ? the water sprayers will throw pulverized water 2,000 feet into the air to dispel pollution @entity25 cannon : the sprayers have been placed next to construction works for a new subway station size matters : the cannons are enormous and have been getting a lot of attention from passers - by the two long - range sprayers are able to pulverize and spurt out tap water to wipe out dust and smog within a radius of 600 meters to reduce air pollution caused by the metro construction			1
@entity41 , professor of atmospheric chemistry at the @entity43 , said the water will cling on to the pollutants and bring them back down to earth			1
he told @entity48 : ' @entity11 has a big problem with smog , like lots of @entity4 cities			1
this is a small - scale effort to damp down the dust			0
the water will go up as a fine mist , and stick to the dust and form larger particles - and fall back down to the surface under gravity			2
it 's basically replicating rain on a local level			0
' this does of course mean that anyone in the vicinity is likely to get quite mucky			0
however , professor @entity41 said that ' it will stop dust spreading over a wider area '			0
it wo n't stop pollution elsewhere , though , he added			0
earlier this year @entity4 scientists said that pollution 900 miles away in @entity73 was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter			1
it has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated , so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply			2
issue : pollution is a major problem in many @entity4 cities calamity : earlier this year the pollution in @entity73 was said by one expert to be having a similar effect to that of a nuclear winter this process was under way in @entity4 ’s capital city and six northern provinces , according to @entity98 from @entity100 ’s @entity99 and @entity101 warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer , it could affect food production , according to @entity106			1
pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded , roads closed and tourists numbers hit , while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the @entity113 , whose readings in @entity73 in february had alarming results			0
it was reported that the level of @entity120 particles , a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream , reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre , far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe , which is 25			0
authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased			0
it remains to be seen whether the water sprayers can form part of a long - term solution .			2

two giant sprayers have been set up in @entity11 , in @entity4 's @entity13 province
they will squirt water 2,000 feet into the air to dispel lingering pollution
the water will stick to the pollutants and bring them back to earth
earlier this year pollution in @entity4 was compared to a nuclear winter
