by @entity0 among a tomb of gold pins , pearls and a rare bronze mirror dating back to the early @entity6 , researchers have discovered a heavily deformed human skull			1
it is thought the tomb and skull found in the @entity12 region of @entity13 have lain undiscovered for almost 1,650 years and may belong to an aristocrat			1
the forehead of the woman ’s skull has been flattened , forcing the rear of the skull to narrow and become cone - shaped , and this artificial cranial deformation was a common practice in certain parts of the world at that time			1
the cone - shaped skull was found in one of 18 tombs buried in @entity12			1
the tomb and skull is thought to be 1,650 years old when artificial cranial deformation was a common practice			1
flattening the skull deliberately and forcing the rear of the head into almost a point was seen as a sign of wealth and status artificial cranial deformation , also known as ' head flattening ' or ' head binding ' , is a deliberate method of deforming a person 's skull			1
the skull could be flattened , elongated , rounded or moulded into a cone - like shape			0
the process usually began around a month after birth and continued for six months , although it can also be practiced for years until the desired shape was achieved			0
practitioners used boards or thin strips of bandage to achieve the desired effect			0
skull deformation was a practice made popular by the @entity56 and spread to @entity57 during the time of the @entity59			2
it was particularly popular in @entity61			0
early examples of cranial deformation were found to date back to 45,000 b.c and were even found in the skulls of neanderthals in southwest @entity66			1
it still occurs today in a few places , like @entity69 - an island in the @entity71			0
lead archaeologist @entity72 believes the graves were reserved for soldiers and their families from @entity66 who fought for the @entity76			2
other treasures found in the aristocrat ’s tomb were chatelaines - decorative belt hooks and chains worn at the waist - and a stag antler comb			2
the mirror , as well as the chains , are thought to have originated in the @entity87 region of @entity66 and the tomb was one of 18 found buried in the @entity91 region of @entity12			1
‘ the deformation of the skull with the help of bandages and small boards is a practice coming from central @entity66 , ’ @entity72 told livescience			1
