from more than a mile away you could easily see the tower of @entity5 and @entity7 church , and even through the driving rain , the ancient stone houses were visible all around it			1
if only you could get to them			2
but yesterday , surrounded by flood water up to 10ft deep , this little @entity13 village was facing its fourth day as a reluctant island community			1
on one side of the torrent , spectators gathered at a shoreline that should n’t have been a shoreline , gazing in wonder			2
on the other , it transpired , bored , stranded residents paced the streets , went to each other ’s houses for tea or simply sat and waited for help from the mainland			2
and waited , and waited			0
waders on : @entity0 in the village of @entity2 on the @entity13 levels which was cut off by flooding yesterday i paddled a canoe to the newly formed @entity36 ( population , 210 ) , which has been virtually cut off from the outside world and is angry that it has had to endure its second @entity41 - style flood in a year after nine disaster - free centuries			1
a small white hatchback was just visible beneath the waves ; some ducks landed beside the top of two 30mph signs poking up from what used to be a main road into @entity2			1
not that many homes here are actually underwater			1
it is lapping at the doorsteps of a few and seeping up through the flagstones , and even yesterday , when the sun came out after a torrential downpour , it revealed that the water level was still creeping up			1
but the name of the village derives from the @entity60 for ‘ great island ’ – and that ’s exactly what @entity2 has become			1
‘ you just ca n’t get anywhere , ’ said 66 - year - old @entity64 , pedalling his bike around the new shoreline			0
i ’ve done a whole circuit and i ’ve only covered about a mile and a half			0
i reckon it will be two weeks before you ’ll be able to drive a car out of here			0
’ improvised transport : the community was surrounded by flood water up to 10ft deep concerns : the water levels in the village are said to be creeping up , despite the fact the sun was out yesterday behind him as he spoke , the @entity85 and 15th century church was opening its doors as a centre for dropping off free food and provisions			1
one man arrived by tractor to collect a few supplies ; a woman left with some cans of dog food and two bottles of water			1
‘ everything we ’ve done here we ’ve done on our own , ’ said @entity99 , 29 , walking two @entity101 terriers with husband @entity102 and mother @entity103			0
‘ we ’ve been left to fend for ourselves			0
apart from the people who dropped off sandbags , we have n’t seen one official here			0
’ there is widespread criticism locally of the @entity112 ’s flood prevention and water management strategies			2
@entity102 told me : ‘ when this place was built , monks from the abbey dug the ditches by hand and kept them clear so the water was channelled away			2
since then the rivers have become silted up – they have n’t been dredged properly for about 20 years			0
’ warning : the sign altering residents to flooding seems to have done little to prevent the disruption enclosed : stone walls surrounding fields and farmland managed to contain the flow of rain water nearby , but across a vast swathe of water , @entity131 and @entity132 were among the unlucky ones			1
their house was ‘ tanked ’ after the december flood – waterproofed on the ground floor – but the wet stuff was still finding a way in yesterday			0
a baby grand piano that @entity131 spent £ 7,000 refurbishing was raised on axle stands in what used to be the lounge			0
meanwhile the only music was the sound of electric motors struggling to pump out water as about 2ft of it slopped against stone walls and sandbagged doors			2
@entity132 , 60 , somehow gave the appearance of chirpiness amid all the chaos , but admitted she had ‘ done a lot of crying ’ these last few @entity158 was the name of their house , i asked ? she looked briefly out of the window			0
‘ @entity162 , ’ she said , and smiled			0
struggle : villagers have been left to fend for themselves with most of the surrounding main roads being blocked by rain water strong winds : the storm conditions which battered the @entity169 damaged a @entity171 shelter in @entity172 , @entity173 caution : around 360 flood warnings or alerts have been put in place for @entity177 , @entity173 and @entity178 , with three severe warnings in @entity180			1

@entity2 on the @entity182 was *rendered* *inaccessible* after torrential rain fell onto surrounding fields
the name of the village derives from the @entity60 for ' great island ' , which what the community has reluctantly become
many homes had not been flooded , bu the *rising* water levels were lapping at doorsteps
