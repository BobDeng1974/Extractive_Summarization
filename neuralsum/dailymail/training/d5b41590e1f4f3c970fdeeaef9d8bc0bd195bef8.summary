@entity1 and @entity11 footballer @entity2 could not understand why their normally active dog @entity14 suddenly wanted to sleep all day			1
investigations eventually revealed that the couple 's @entity17 cooker was leaking lethal carbon monoxide gas that could have killed them			1
one - year - old @entity14 was sleepy because he was being slowly poisoned by the colourless , odourless gas			2
ms @entity1 , 22 , who works as a model , said : ' without his strange behaviour @entity2 and i would have went months not realizing what was leaking into our home			2
' i love him so much and i 'm so thankful to have such a wonderful companion - he saved our life			0
' @entity1 and @entity2 , 21 , moved from @entity29 where @entity2 used to play fro @entity30 to their new home in @entity32 in july			2
after noticing a strange smell , @entity1 had the stove checked and discovered it had been serviced and passed that month			1
however , she said : ' within the past four weeks , @entity14 was sleeping all day			2
he had stopped playing with his toys and was just very lethargic			1
' after returning from a family trip to the @entity37 , @entity1 noticed @entity14 was getting worse			1
she said : ' he just was n't right at all			0
usually @entity14 would be up and down like a yo - yo pestering me to play but instead , he went up to our room and slept for five hours			0
' @entity1 had experienced a few brief moments of sickness but @entity2 did not show any symptoms at all			2
determined to get the bottom of @entity14 's strange behaviour , she called an engineer out to the home who immediately realised what was happening			2
he told the couple that if @entity1 had not picked up on @entity14 's sickness their exposure to the carbon monoxide leaking from the stove ' could have been fatal '			1
heather with @entity14 : ' he makes our house a home ' , she said @entity14 's unusual behaviour alerted his owners to the carbon monoxide poisoning ' i explained about @entity14 and myself and he was so genuinely concerned and happy that he 'd discovered this for us before it could have been fatal , ' she said			1
' he explained that the smell of gas was not nearly as dangerous as the issue with the leak of carbon monoxide			1
' i can not believe how lucky we are - had we not caught this when we did , it could have been fatal to us all			0
' i do n't know what i 'd do without @entity14 - he makes our house a home			0
' she added : ' within two days of the problem being solved @entity14 is back to his usual self			0
' carbon monoxide poisoning claims the lives of around 50 people a year in the @entity82			1
@entity1 and @entity2 said their dog was now back to his usual happy self @entity86 , president and director of @entity88 who raise awareness and publish data of @entity93 deaths and accidents , said that carbon monoxide prevention needs a " belt and braces " approach			1
she said : ' firstly , well done to the dog and well done to the girl			2
' often our dogs , cats and other pets are more susceptible to the gas because of their smaller lungs and weight			0
' that 's why miners used to take canaries down the mines - if they stopped singing you knew to get out because there was @entity93 present			0
' we encourage all homes to open windows for ventilation , have their chimneys regularly swept and install detectors - it really has to be a belt and braces approach to keeping an eye on @entity93 ' the @entity124 said pet owners should be more aware of their pets ' behaviour			0
a spokesman said : ' this demonstrates the importance of pet owners being aware of their pet 's normal behaviour and of being observant			0
' if they do notice any change in their pet 's behaviour it 's important to seek advice from their vet as it could be a sign that their pet is suffering from a medical problem			0
' @entity147 , chief executive of @entity148 , commented : ' the couple involved in this incident had a lucky escape , but tragically others are not always so fortunate			0
' carbon monoxide is a highly poisonous gas			1
you ca n't see it , taste it or smell it and without an adequate supply of fresh air , it can kill quickly			0
' the symptoms are also very similar to flu , which at this time of year is worrying if people get the two confused			0
