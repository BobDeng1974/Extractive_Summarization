by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 15 september 2013 the happy couple : @entity2 is marrying @entity3 on saturday during the long months of planning , who would blame @entity6 if she had , on occasion , got lost in misty - eyed reveries when contemplating her son @entity10 ’s wedding this afternoon			1
no doubt she allowed herself a smile of satisfaction at the thought of her guests clinking glasses on her beautifully manicured , sun - dappled lawn as her eldest son celebrates his marriage to his long - time girlfriend			1
after all , on paper at least , everything is set fair			0
the venue is @entity25 , the £ 5.75 million grade i - listed mansion in the lush @entity28 countryside that @entity6 shares with her husband , @entity30			1
nor could the blushing bride , @entity3 , 25 , be any more suitable			1
pretty and brainy , she is an @entity32 graduate with a multi-millionaire father			0
then there is a guest - list that includes royalty — an @entity38 prince and his wife			2
what could possibly go wrong ? sadly , when it comes to family weddings , giddy expectation so often gives way to fraught reality			0
to start with , @entity6 has been fretting about the weather			1
rather optimistically , it seems , she had been relying on the sun shining on her 170 guests as they mill around in the vast garden during the four - hour gap between the 3.45pm service and the start of dinner in a specially - erected marquee			2
all this week , she has been glued to her @entity57 , looking at weather forecasts which have ominously predicted that the heavens are expected to open			1
how , she has asked friends , is everyone going to shelter from the rain in the giant tent while the caterers are trying to lay tables ? and that is not the half of it			2
yesterday , the @entity69 revealed that the bride ’s stepmother , tv weathergirl @entity70 , has been mysteriously barred from the wedding			1
the reason , i can reveal , is that she has had a massive , tearful falling - out with @entity3 over comments @entity78 made about her mother			1
nor has miss @entity70 given up on the idea of attending without a fight , and there are suggestions she will still turn up regardless			2
however , it seems that even if the bride relents , she will not be given a place on the top table			0
excluding : @entity10 and @entity3 , pictured in 2009 , has allegedly banned the bride 's step - mother @entity70 from saturday 's nuptials @entity90 : @entity70 , who married @entity3 's father @entity91 in 2007 , allegedly made a comment about @entity3 's mother the problem began , i gather , at a recent pre-wedding dinner party attended by 29 - year - old groom @entity10 , @entity3 , her father ( motor - racing entrepreneur @entity99 ) and his second wife , miss @entity70			1
it seems that @entity102 - born miss @entity70 , 55 , inadvertently made a comment about the bride ’s @entity105 mother , @entity104 — mr @entity99 ’s first wife — that @entity3 took the wrong way			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity70 meant anything by it , but @entity3 was in floods of tears , ’ i was told			1
‘ it ’s just the sort of typical misunderstanding that happens in the run - up to a big wedding			2
everyone thought the issue would settle down but @entity3 said she did n’t want @entity70 at the wedding			1
’ miss @entity70 ’s one - time fiancé , the flamboyant @entity122 mp @entity121 , says he is ‘ not surprised ’ that she has been ‘ uninvited ’ and suggested there were several reasons			1
admittedly he offered no proof that miss @entity70 ever uttered the remark , but said that @entity127 may have heard her comment that she thought him a ‘ war criminal ’ and did n’t like his policies			2
he added : ‘ there is a comic - tragic irony that she now is to be related to him in the future			2
’ meanwhile , mrs @entity6 , 58 , tried to escape the fray by taking her 25 - year - old daughter @entity136 with her to a spa in @entity138 last month to prepare for the big day			1
indeed , she has been making plans for the wedding ever since @entity10 and @entity3 got engaged at @entity141			1
there has been so much to arrange			0
for instance , the @entity145 ’ youngest child , the musically - gifted @entity143 , 13 , must be rushed back home from @entity148 where he is due to spend this morning rehearsing a production of @entity150			0
the young singer made his @entity153 debut in the chorus of @entity155 last year			0
no wonder , given all this angst , that paterfamilias @entity30 — wisely — has stayed well out of the way over the last week			2
he has been abroad ( as usual ) on business and was due to fly home only yesterday			0
among their guests is , i am told , the @entity38 prince @entity165 and his wife @entity166			0
a friend of the family , he became headline news in 2006 when @entity2 was @entity170 and accepted a freebie holiday with the prince ’s family — one of several the @entity145 have taken with them — at his 16th - century @entity176 palace @entity175 , set in the hills of @entity178 near the walled town of @entity180			1
in may , an @entity38 magistrate took possession of the estate over an ongoing fraud inquiry , though the 75 - year - old aristocrat denies any wrongdoing			0
wedding : @entity30 and @entity6 's son @entity10 is marrying @entity3 and the party afterwards is taking place at the family mansion in @entity191 , @entity28 the @entity2 mansion : @entity25 , in @entity191 , where the wedding party will take place also invited is @entity194 , the controversial former labour - fundraiser who was embroiled in the so - called cash - for - peerages scandal that engulfed the party in 2006			1
but it has been suggested that the peer might not be able to attend as the wedding falls on the @entity201 holy day of @entity202			0
there is also talk that the groom has invited senior officials from the @entity206			0
for the @entity208 graduate is keen to follow in his 60 - year - old father ’s footsteps and wants to become an mp			0
he is said to have targeted two safe seats in @entity213 , where he hopes to be selected as a candidate to fight the 2015 election			0
one is due to be vacated by former @entity218 minister @entity217 and the other is currently held by @entity220 — @entity127 ’s millionaire old pal who controversially lent @entity222 £ 373,000 to buy a house — who will be nearly 77 come the election			0
last year , @entity10 gave up his well - paid job as a merchant banker with @entity228 in @entity148 to take on the role of business development manager at @entity231 — an employment agency in @entity213 involved in the government ’s flagship @entity233			0
he has helped canvass for @entity218 , for example in the @entity238 by - election last year			0
certainly , he and his bride , who attended the prestigious @entity241 in @entity148 , have all the hallmarks of a power couple in the making			0
they met eight years ago when she was doing work experience for the then @entity218 defence secretary @entity248			0
in 2009 , she also did a stint working for her future father - in - law ’s charity , the @entity250			0
and dark - haired @entity3 , who has a degree in @entity253 from @entity254 , @entity32 , has the sort of exemplary left - wing credentials to equip her for the high - powered life of a @entity218 politician ’s wife			1
she works as an analyst for @entity261 , which helps raise funds from private investors for good causes and is currently working on a pilot programme involving @entity266			0
in her spare time , she is a governor at a @entity269 primary school			0
@entity3 ’s parents are , of course , divorced			2
her mother is the daughter of a former @entity105 government minister and one - time mayor of @entity275			0
family affair : @entity10 , far right , with his parents and siblings @entity279 and @entity280 in 2006 during @entity30 's time as prime minister her father , mr @entity99 , 64 , married miss @entity70 in 2007 after a whirlwind ten - month romance			1
the problems over the presence of miss @entity70 at the ceremony aside , another hitch , it has been reported , is that the young couple — who bought a house together in @entity293 , @entity148 , last year — have not seen completely eye - to - eye with @entity30 and @entity6 over the arrangements			1
@entity10 , who previously lived in a £ 1.3 million @entity298 - listed @entity297 townhouse bought for him by his parents in @entity300 , @entity148 , is said to fear that the wedding could be considered too posh for a potential @entity218 mp for an economically - ravaged @entity304 city , which would damage his chances of getting grassroots party backing			2
accordingly , the menu is said to be a simple affair			0
others invited to today ’s nuptials include @entity10 ’s younger brother @entity279 and his girlfriend @entity314 , plus mrs @entity6 ’s 81 - year - old father , former hell - raising actor @entity316 , and his fourth wife @entity317 , who unsuccessfully stood as a @entity218 candidate at the last general election , as well as @entity6 ’s mother , @entity320			1
@entity6 ’s only full sister , @entity321 , with whom she has had a turbulent relationship , is also expected to be present , as are @entity6 ’s half - sisters @entity323 and @entity325 , from @entity316 ’s former relationship with @entity328 sketch - writer @entity327			1
not expected to attend , however , is another of mrs @entity6 ’s six half - sisters , journalist - turned - peace - campaigner @entity330 , who publicly criticised mr @entity2 ’s decision to go to war in @entity333 and branded @entity6 as ‘ high and mighty ’			1
@entity330 , who appeared in @entity334 ’s i ’m a celebrity			2
@entity336 ! in 2006 , converted to @entity337 in 2010			0
with so much to contend with , it is hardly surprising that earlier this week mrs @entity6 checked herself , the bride and bridesmaids to the plush @entity342 health spa in @entity343 , @entity344 , for a pre-wedding pampering session			2
i am told that @entity10 has also booked into the spa , where he has requested a facial			0
@entity6 , whose love of a freebie is well - known , has also been telling friends that @entity342 has offered to supply a team of beauticians , at no charge , to be based in a cottage in the grounds of the @entity145 ’ estate to touch up the make - up of @entity6 and other female guests during the evening			1
given all those pre-wedding headaches , a frazzled mrs @entity6 ( who is expected to wear a gold and cream lace ensemble ) needs all the pampering she can get .			1

@entity2 , 29 , is marrying long - term girlfriend @entity3 , 25
wedding will be held at @entity30 and @entity6 's @entity28 mansion
her stepmother , weather girl @entity70 , has been ' uninvited '
his ' aunt ' @entity6 's half - sister @entity330 is expected to be a no - show
