the folks at @entity17 , the @entity18 - based design company behind the @entity20 wellness watch , drafted a mock - up of the tattoo for @entity15 's @entity23			2
they called it ' @entity0			1
' the foundation of @entity26 would be a visible tattoo implanted in the knuckle of the thumb and a larger , invisible tattoo implanted in the palm , according to @entity15			1
the tattoo would interact with everything the consumer touches and would recognize the consumer 's location as well as movements within the body			1
