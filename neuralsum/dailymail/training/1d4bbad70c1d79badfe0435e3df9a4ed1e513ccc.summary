by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:23 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 18:31 est , 1 october 2013 racing pundit @entity2 pleaded with @entity3 to help him get his job back after being sacked by @entity5 , a tribunal heard yesterday			1
the 73 - year - old twice asked @entity7 , who led the new - look coverage , to hold meetings on his behalf with the station ’s creative controller , @entity13			1
but his attempts failed in part because miss @entity16 , a former @entity18 controller , was a ‘ serial age discrimination offender ’ , he told the hearing			2
discrimination claim : @entity2 , 73 , pictured with his wife @entity22 - who he has called ' @entity23 ' - arrives at the central @entity25 employment tribunal today			1
he is suing for £ 3million @entity2 is seeking £ 3 million compensation , alleging @entity5 axed him in 2012 after 29 years because of his age			1
the @entity29 - educated presenter accepted that his ‘ brand ’ was that of a ‘ big , fat , sexist , letch ’			2
he admitted there had been plenty of complaints to @entity5 about his behaviour , and he accepted descriptions of him as ‘ nasty , revolting , rude ’ , ‘ boorish ’ and ‘ obnoxious and sexist ’			1
but he said : ‘ i was fully aware @entity5 approved of it because they kept on having me on their programmes			1
’ flamboyant : @entity2 , known for his bling , sideburns and deerstalker , claims he is still able to cover horse racing and denies appearances on celebrity big brother have detracted from his seriousness media scrum : @entity2 talks to the press outside his tribunal hearing in central @entity25 where he was giving evidence today he claimed @entity5 had encouraged him to promote himself that way as part of his ‘ pantomime villain ’ act			1
and he insisted he had called for more women presenters on @entity59 – despite once describing one of them as the ‘ lay of the day ’ live on air and nicknaming others the ‘ saucy minx ’ and ‘ the pouty heiress ’			2
he also referred to 42 - year - old @entity7 as ‘ ravishing ’ until she objected to the description			2
despite this , @entity2 approached @entity7 for help after losing his job when the racing contract was awarded to production company @entity73			1
he said : ‘ before this legal action , at my request , she tried to arrange a face to face discussion last december and then again , in january with miss @entity16 who she knew from working together at the @entity18			2
’ but the meetings never happened because miss @entity16 and @entity5 head of sport @entity81 had already ‘ made their decision ’ , @entity2 alleged			1
' peace talks ' : @entity3 tried to act as a go - between and act as peacemaker after @entity2 was axed by @entity5 last year , he said he said : ‘ that was final			1
courtesy , and at least giving the victim a personal hearing and opportunity to put their case , meant nothing			0
’ @entity2 was accused of ‘ grandstanding ’ by @entity5 barrister @entity98 during a lively appearance at the @entity100			1
the pundit claimed he was the most important member of the @entity59 team , comparing himself to a star footballer			2
he also described his love of breasts , explaining : ‘ i happen to sadly be someone who likes the female front structure			0
’ and he told of his attraction to @entity109 and @entity110 , adding : ‘ i do n’t think i ’ve got much of a chance			0
’ horse racing pundit @entity2 said he has put his home at risk to bring his age discrimination case against @entity5			1
the 73 year - old , who lives with his wife @entity22 in @entity118 , north @entity25 , said if he lost the case it would be ' disastrous '			2
he told the tribunal : ' we had to take out a mortgage equity release to pay for our case			0
' it is a huge expense			0
my home is now on the line because of this			0
i believe what i ’m doing is right			0
' the pundit is suing the broadcaster for £ 3million			1
he added : ' i have put my own personal future on the line			0
' but i think it ’s so important for people in their 30 ’s up to their 70 ’s who fear anonymous suits and skirts coming along and getting rid of them			0
' the tribunal heard @entity2 had been warned by his bosses that his forays into reality tv , including celebrity big brother , were harming his journalistic career			1
but he said : ‘ @entity5 … enjoyed and encouraged my media antics			1
it is all part of the media game			0
‘ in particular i was expected to play up to the role in which i had been cast – a sort of pantomime villain – which is how some sections of the media and public have tended to see me over the years			0
‘ i would not have taken on these other commitments if @entity5 executives had disapproved			1
‘ if anyone had ever been concerned , or believed i should change , they only had to discuss the issue with me			0
’ @entity2 added : ‘ no one did more for women than i did on @entity59			1
time and again i said why have n’t we got more women on the programme , why do we have all these boring men ? ’ he said in a statement : ' at the @entity18 @entity3 approached me through intermediaries asking me to work alongside her at the racing at the @entity18			1
she wanted me to join her			0
he added : ' we regularly chatted about the prospects , tactics and what role i advised her to take up along with conditions and terms to seek before agreeing to sign up			0
' we go back , i believe as mutual admirers , for 25 years			0
' he added : ' long before ms @entity3 became the national treasure she now is i was a huge admirer of her natural talent , wide ranging knowledge of countless issues , spontaneous repartee and communication skills			1
admitting he was a ' taxi for hire ' from 2010 after his days on @entity5 were cut to just 40 a year , @entity2 said he had pursued appearances on reality tv			1
' discrimination ' : @entity2 , 73 , revealed he has put his home in @entity118 , north @entity25 , at risk to fight the tribunal claim but he said his persona as a ' bombastic and domineering ' individual was a pantomime character that he would have reined in if he had been asked			1
' when i came out of celebrity big brother in 2005 to all the howling and catcalling , @entity198 said , " do n’t worry @entity2 it ’s all pantomime "			1
that ’s all it was , not serious , ' he said			0
' this is a different persona , you are putting on a performance , you are doing a pantomime act			2
' the tribunal was told of several occasions @entity2 had been acting in a way he accepted was seen as a sexist and a bigot , including incidents in the @entity216 house			2
on another occasion he was thrown off @entity220 ’s @entity219 show for making rude comments to @entity222 about her relationship with her then estranged husband @entity224			0
and he refers to his wife @entity22 - who was supporting him at the hearing - as ' @entity23 ' , because she was ' not very bright , squawks a lot and was easy to catch '			0
in action : @entity3 , who moved to @entity5 from the @entity18 , led a new - look team that was brought in after @entity2 was axed former @entity5 racing presenter @entity230 later said she had her hours slashed in 2009 after 18 years with the broadcaster because she was about to turn 50			1
she said she was left ' angry ' and ' disappointed ' by the move and found denials of ageism by @entity236 , @entity5 ’s head of sport , ' hard to believe '			2
she said in a statement to the tribunal : ' in december 2009 @entity236 telephoned me and told me that he was going to reduce my days from 40 to 15			0
' i had no notice that this was going to happen and was extremely surprise and disappointed			0
' i was shocked and did n’t fully understand the reasons for this			0
the only reason i could think that my annual days were being reduced was because of my age - i was due to turn 50 in 2010			0
' she said she was ' effectively replaced ' by @entity248 and @entity249 , who were 31 and 36 respectively , at the time			0
he also praised the ‘ bravery ’ of @entity253 who sued the @entity18 for sex and age discrimination in 2010 after she and three other women in their 40s and 50s were dropped from @entity260 when miss @entity16 was @entity18 controller			0
