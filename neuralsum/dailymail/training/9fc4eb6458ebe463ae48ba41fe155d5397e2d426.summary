by @entity1 reporter a set of slides purporting to show ufos are part of the latest batch of government documents leaked by @entity9 whistleblower @entity8			2
the slides belong to a powerpoint presentation created by the @entity13 spy agency @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
three of the slides depict alien spaceships , but they ’ve been dismissed by one @entity18 expert as fakes			2
‘ the presentation features three @entity18 pictures , on slides 35 to 37 , ’ @entity22 , author of @entity23 , told @entity24			2
is this august 2011 photo by a holidaymaker in @entity27 , @entity13 , proof of ufos or simply an out - of - focus seagull taking a poo , as @entity22 claims ‘ the first is a black and white picture of a ufo over @entity33 , @entity34 , taken on 23 april 1950 , the second a screenshot of a @entity18 video by @entity37 filmed in @entity38 and the third was taken on 01 august 2011 by a holidaymaker at @entity41 , @entity42 near @entity43 , @entity27			0
' they have been explained respectively by skeptics as a hub cap thrown in the air , a deflated @entity49 balloon and an out - of - focus seagull taking a poo			0
’ in fact @entity22 believes the document is really proof of government attempts at mind control and the slides are part of guidelines for spies on how to spread misinformation via the internet			1
‘ the main evidence for the cover - up of @entity18 reports and manipulation of @entity18 beliefs , as revealed by the documents released by @entity8 , is contained in a powerpoint presentation called , @entity68			1
fake : the images , leaked by @entity8 , right , have been rubbished by @entity22 , author of @entity23 , left , who says skeptics have already dismissed the images as fake @entity22 claims this screenshot of a @entity18 video by @entity37 filmed in @entity38 really shows a deflated @entity49 balloon ‘ this was produced by the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , @entity13 secret intelligence agency and features fifty slides related to using the internet for psychological operations ( psy - ops )			1
' it was produced by a unit called the @entity85 ( @entity85 ) for presentations to the @entity87 , @entity9 ( @entity9 ) and other agencies			0
’ @entity22 believes that governments know that supposed @entity18 can be used to control the minds of citizens , so the fact that @entity8 leaked these slides could be a big blow to the agencies that use the presentation to train spies			1
‘ government agencies are still aware of the power of the belief in @entity18 , and that they are willing to use the internet to exploit these beliefs , ’ said @entity22			0
this slide shows a black and white picture of a @entity18 over @entity33 , @entity34 , taken on 23 april 1950 , but skeptics believe it is of a hub cap thrown in the air ‘ such deception can be used as a means of covering - up more mundane terrestrial activities ( like the testing of secret aircraft or military exercises ) or to undermine the credibility of ufologists			1
‘ the overall point of the presentation is to discuss how the internet and modern media can be used to discredit people and to spread deception			0
' unfortunately , there is no explanatory text with the @entity18 pictures , so we can only speculate about what point they were being used to make			0

the latest *official* document to be linked by @entity8 is a presentation created by the @entity13 spy agency @entity12
the presentation is called @entity68 and *includes* three slides showing what appear to be @entity18
leading @entity18 expert @entity22 has said that skeptics have already dismissed the images as fake
he believes spies are given the images along with guidelines on how to spread misinformation via the internet
such deception can be used to help coverup more mundane terrestrial activities like testing secret aircraft or military exercises , he said
