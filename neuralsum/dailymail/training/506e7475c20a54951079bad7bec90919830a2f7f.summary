the bloated autocrat was pictured touring a home for retired scientists south of @entity8 , the @entity9 capital , with his usual coterie of advisers and military men			1
the newly completed @entity13 was well served with pools and water features , but @entity0 , still walking with a cane , did not don his own swimsuit and test the water for himself			0
he looked a shade slimmer and it was claimed he had drastic weight loss treatment in @entity4 after developing an addiction to the @entity35			1
a a source told the @entity37 that the 31 - year - old had spent the past few weeks in a @entity40 hospital having his stomach tied , or ‘ banded ’ , to help him fight his weight gain			0
it was claimed @entity0 has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of @entity48 cheese , which he got a taste for while a student in @entity51			1
the reputable source , who has connections with intelligence agencies in the @entity55 , said @entity0 ’s stay in hospital in @entity4 was the reason for his no - show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling @entity61			2
@entity0 finally resurfaced with the help of a walking stick after an unexplained and prolonged absence @entity65 : @entity0 inspects a substance believed to be cheese at a @entity9 factory			2
a unhealthy appetite for @entity48 is believed to be a key factor in @entity0 's weight ballooning in recent months issues : @entity0 is reported to be suffering from gout , from diabetes , from a brain haemorrhage , from a heart ailment , from a leg injury that required surgery from a doctor , from mental illness or from a cheese addiction @entity0 has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures , to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in august			1

his absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup in the nuclear - armed state smiling : this photograph from @entity9 newspaper @entity115 shows @entity9 leader @entity0 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex in @entity8 another photograph from @entity115 of @entity0 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex enemy : a @entity123 man watches a tv news program showing @entity0 using his cane yesterday not un-well : tv monitors in @entity123 show a news report about the health of the @entity9 leader			1
the captions mockingly refer to the ' @entity131 ' the ambassador ’s comment that @entity0 was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital , as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic , rather than treatment for an illness			0
the @entity9 regime has made no mention of @entity0 being in @entity40 and the claim by the source - a former government official of a @entity145 country who retains close ties with @entity148 intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified			2
but @entity8 officials have admitted that @entity0 has been suffering ‘ discomfort ’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country			0

but despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens , @entity0 continues to gorge on @entity51 cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate			1
earlier this year it was revealed that @entity0 tried to send a team of food experts to the @entity178 city of @entity179 for a crash course in dairy production			0
