by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:12 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 08:36 est , 12 july 2013 cancer charities and @entity3 today condemned the government for shelving plans to firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets			1
ministers were accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives			1
one @entity14 mp said it was a ' day of shame ' for the government which meant ' more lives ruined for political expediency '			1
shelved : @entity19 will not follow @entity20 in introducing plain cigarette packaging delay : laws passed in @entity20 mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking , but the @entity29 government will not follow suit health campaigners had urged the government to follow @entity20 which this year became the only country to adopt plain packaging , all cigarette packs are drab green			1
research suggests non-smokers and young people find less appealing			0
but health secretary @entity38 has decided not to introduce the same rules in @entity19 , claiming there is not enough evidence it would have a significant impact			1
questions were also raised about the role played by @entity14 election strategist @entity45 , whose lobbying firm has worked for the tobacco industry			1
the @entity29 government has spent a year considering a ban , and health ministers were understood to be keen to go ahead			1
but it was not included in the @entity51 in may , and now the idea has been kicked into the long grass			0
a @entity55 source said : ‘ only @entity20 has done it so far and they only did it at the end of last year			2
so it is not clear yet whether or not it would actually have any effect			0
it is very hard to tell , which is why it is being shelved for now			2
’ smoking causes over 100,000 deaths a year in the @entity29			2
last april , displaying cigarettes in supermarkets was banned , and this will be extended to all other shops from april 2015			0
row : health secretary @entity38 was accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives @entity73 supported plain packs at first , but the government has cooled on the idea			1
while health groups have called it a ‘ golden opportunity ’ to cut smoking - related disease , industry insiders say plain packs will lead to more counterfeit cigarettes and less tax revenue			2
some @entity14 @entity3 condemned it as a ‘ nanny state ’ measure			1
dr @entity87 , chief executive of @entity90 , heavily criticised the decision to shelve plain packaging , warning concerns about the impact on the tobacco industry would cost lives			1
every year 200,000 children in the @entity29 were ' lured ' into starting smoking , he added			2
' this decision is bitterly disappointing and lives will be lost as a result			2
we ca n't stand by and watch as these lives are lost , ' dr @entity100 said			2
' the government has stalled in the face of strong evidence and instead reacted to myths perpetuated by the tobacco industry , an industry well - known for suppressing the truth about its lethal products			1
prime minister @entity73 has abandoned a ban on multi-buy drink offers			1
it means two - for - one or supermarket ‘ meal deals ’ with free wine will continue to be available			2
there were fears a ban would affect responsible consumers rather than problem drinkers			2
the @entity121 is expected to shelve the idea next week along with plans for a minimum alcohol price per unit of 45p			2
a government source said the ideas were ‘ dead and buried ’			2
instead , selling alcohol below cost price , or the rate of duty plus vat , will be banned – affecting only a handful of products			0
' the government had a choice : protect children from an addiction that kills 100,000 people in the @entity29 every year or protect tobacco industry profits			1
we believe it has made the wrong choice			0
there ’s strong public support for standard packs ; we urge the government to act now , without further delay			0
' dr @entity147 , a @entity14 mp and former @entity149 , condemned the decision as a ' tragic waste of an opportunity '			1
she claimed there would be ' more lives ruined for political expediency '			0
writing on @entity157 , dr @entity147 added : ' @entity159 public health			1
a day of shame for this government ; the only winners big tobacco , big alcohol and big undertakers			1
' @entity166 , chief executive of the @entity167 , said : ' it is bewildering that the @entity29 government is still allowing the tobacco industry to target young people by refusing to introduce standardised packaging			1
' the time has surely now come for the government to stop dithering on this issue			0
using expensively - designed packaging to sell cigarettes to young people is wrong and should be stopped			0
' however @entity14 mp @entity178 welcomed the decision to postpone plans for plain packaging for cigarettes until it could be proved to cut take up of smoking among young people			1
' there are two main concerns , one is that essentially any decision really must be unequivocally evidence - based ... and to contemplate letting these very significant measures the evidence base has to be absolutely rock solid and reliable and to date it ’s not , ' he told @entity191			0
' there is this additional issue and one that ca n't be ignored , which is that there are substantial intellectual property rights that are being stripped away by removing brand rights , which are going to cost the exchequer significant sums of money in compensation			0
' i 'm also very much of the view that we have got to be laser - like in our approach towards getting the economy out of recession , getting the deficit down and this sort of message and regulation such as this really runs counter to our view that we are entirely open to business			0
' not enough evidence : @entity55 said it was not clear whether plain packaging had any deterrent effect in the @entity219 , public health minister @entity218 insisted the government ’s position on plain packaging had not changed , but she refused to to be drawn on how long ministers would wait before deciding whether to press ahead			1
' we have to wait to see the evidence as it emerges			0
i ’m afraid it ’s how long is a piece of string , ' she said			0
the @entity230 questioned the involvement in the decision to drop plain packaging of mr @entity45 , whose pr and lobbying firm @entity236 was on a retainer for @entity238 when the industry was trying to block plain packet laws in @entity20			1
@entity241 , a shadow health minister , said : ' the @entity242 used to say there were in favour of this policy , that children should be protected			0
' but now , not long after employing @entity247 , a strategist linked to lobbying in the tobacco industry , @entity73 is backing down			0
' people will rightly wonder if the government is breaking its promise , despite the medical evidence and the wishes of @entity29 families , in order to please its friends in big business			1
' @entity73 needs to explain why he ’s doing it , when he decided , whether @entity45 had any input into the decision , and whether he was aware of @entity45 ’s alleged business interests when he appointed him			0
' mr @entity73 has repeatedly insisted that has ' never been lobbied by @entity45 about anything '			0
@entity263 , a professor of public health at the @entity265 , who was instrumental in bringing about packaging reforms in @entity20 , claimed the @entity250 was “ putting business interests in front of public health			1
he told @entity191 ’s @entity272 programme : ' i think the @entity250 are being very disingenuous in saying let ’s see what happens in @entity20			0
' it ’s going to probably take them a good many years to see whether or not there has been an accelerated downturn			0
' a @entity281 spokesman said : ' this is an important decision and we make no apology for taking time to get it right			0
