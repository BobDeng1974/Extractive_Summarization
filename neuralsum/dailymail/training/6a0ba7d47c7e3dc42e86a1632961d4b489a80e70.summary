by @entity1 reporter published : 11:43 est , 21 october 2012 updated : 11:43 est , 21 october 2012 a teenager has made a miracle recovery - after he had a massive heart attack that left him technically dead for seven minutes - before being saved by his teacher			2
@entity6 , 17 , from @entity7 , collapsed after running up stairs at college - while rushing to get to a hospital appointment			1
the teenager was technically ' dead ' as his heart stopped beating for seven minutes			0
back at home : @entity6 is now recovering with his family , including mum @entity15 ( left ) sister @entity16 and dad @entity17 ( right ) but thanks to the quick thinking of his tutor , who started @entity21 , he has made a miraculous recovery			1
tutor @entity23 desperately battled to keep him alive after calling paramedics - but after realising he had no heartbeat for more than seven minutes , feared the worst			2
after arriving at hospital , doctors warned his terrified parents , @entity15 and @entity17 , that they did n't know whether their sporty son would pull through - and if he did , feared he would be severely brain damaged			2
lucky : doctors had suspected @entity6 had issues with his heart but less than a month after his brush with death , @entity6 has stunned medics by making an amazing recovery - and is now recovering at home in @entity7			1
his mum , @entity15 , 40 , an @entity40 administrator , said : ' we are so grateful to everyone who has helped @entity6 pull through - we ca n't thank them enough			1
' we came so close to losing our son , we 're just so grateful that so many people knew basic first aid , and for everything the doctors have done for him			0
' even after @entity6 's heart had been restarted , the doctors told us they did n't know if he 'd make it through the night			1
' we were distraught - just a few hours before our healthy and happy son had been heading off to college on his moped , and now we were being told we might lose him forever			2
once his heart had been stabilised , they still said that he might have suffered bad brain damage because his heart had been stopped for so long			0
' we were told it would take a long time for him to properly wake up - but a few days later , @entity6 was sitting up in bed laughing and joking			1
' even the nurses in the hospital told us it was a miracle - he was really one of the lucky ones			2
' engineering student @entity6 had been due to attend a hospital appointment for tests after doctors told him they suspected he might have issues with his heart			1
but after running up a flight of stairs at the @entity76 , to grab his coat , the teen suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed , on september 28			2
fortunately , one of his tutors , engineering manager @entity23 , heard him fall - and despite initially thinking that @entity6 had fainted and put him in the recovery position - but quickly realised he had no pulse and began @entity21			1
he was joined by colleagues , including community first responder @entity84 , who took over the cpr , until paramedics arrived and restarted his heart with a defibrillator			1
@entity6 , who collapsed on the top floor of the @entity89 at about 10.30am on friday , september 28 , said : ' i ca n't remember much about what happened			1
' i felt like i was in a swimming pool and i had fallen asleep			0
' i could hear the faint voices of the paramedics calling my name , but i did n't know where i was			0
' i 'm so thankful to the people who saved me - it has n't really sunk in yet how serious it was			0
' @entity6 's parents were already at @entity100 , waiting for @entity6 to arrive for his appointment when they got a call from the college to say their son was being rushed in			1
@entity15 said : ' we were completely panicked - it did n't seem real when they said @entity6 had collapsed and was in an ambulance			1
' we feared the worst , and seeing him in intensive care was devastating			0
' the doctors told us they did n't know if he would pull through - they said he was very very sick			0
' he was being kept alive by machines and was in a coma			0
' they said it would take a long time for him to wake up , but four days after it happened , he was alert and awake			0
' the nurses said there 's not many people lucky enough to survive what he did - and they said it 's a miracle he recovered as quickly as he did			0
" healing : the teenager has now had a pacemaker fitted			0
the device is roughly the same size as a matchbox @entity23 said : ' we knew that @entity6 's life was in the balance , so we all worked as hard as we could to save @entity6			1
' the paramedics were first class and reassured us we did the correct thing and that our reaction had given him a fighting chance			1
' i think someone must have been looking down on him			0
' @entity6 , who was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , has now been fitted with a cardioverter defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat			1
the device , slightly larger than a matchbox , monitors the heart rhythm and can deliver low - voltage electrical impulses to keep the heart beating correctly and larger shocks if needed			0
@entity17 , who works in manufacturing , said : ' we are so grateful to the staff at the college , and especially to @entity23 , who realised what had happened and sprung into action so quickly			0
' we want to share @entity6 's story to encourage people to consider learning basic first aid - it 's so simple that anyone could do it , but all of @entity6 's friends have said that if he 'd collapsed in front of them , they would n't know what to do			2
' i ca n't thank the staff at the school enough for saving my son 's life - there 's no way we can repay them			0
