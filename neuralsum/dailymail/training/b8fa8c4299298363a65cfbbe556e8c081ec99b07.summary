@entity1 shoppers were stunned with the automatic doors of their local supermarket opened and a baby bear strolled down the aisle			1
the cub spent sometime wandering through the streets of @entity8 , firstly walking into the super 8 motel before crossing the road to the @entity12 supermarket			1
shoppers filmed the cub - thought to be about one month old - as it strolled through the feminine hygiene section and past the mouth wash			1
the bear is currently being cared for by the @entity34			0
they said it is unlikely that the bear can be released back into the wild as it has had contact with humans			2
they are now looking to rehouse it in a zoo or a wildlife reserve			2
according to the @entity34 , there are approximately 25,000 - 30,000 bears living in @entity1 's forests			0
despite their fearsome reputation , bears are omnivores whose primary diet includes nuts , berries , grasses and insects			0
however , they will eat small mammals , amphibians and fish			0
the one - month - old cub showed very little interest to any of the mouth wash products on the shelves unsurprisingly , the bear cub walked straight past the the selection of razors before it was captured			1
