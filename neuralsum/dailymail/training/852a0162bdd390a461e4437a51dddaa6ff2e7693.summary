@entity3 has identification tattoos made up of small dots in both ears			2
' one ear has the number ‘ 96 ’ inside , which we believe could be the year he was born			0
' this would mean he is around sixteen years old , which we think would be about right as he is definitely an older cat			0
' his other ear has initials inside , which we think may be his owner ’s			0
' however , we are not going to reveal what these are as these will help us confirm that @entity43 belongs to anyone who does come forward			0

@entity25 added : ' @entity43 is registered on the @entity56 database so he has travelled here from @entity6 at some point			1
' it may be that his owner brought him to @entity62 when they moved here and he has gone missing recently			0
' we also ca n’t rule out the possibility he has come over on holiday with his owner and has been left behind			0
' if he has been an outdoor cat in @entity6 and his owner has given him outside access here too , he could easily have lost his way if he is new to the area			1
' he is underweight , which could be because he ’s been straying for a while but it could also be a result of him being an elderly cat			0
' we hope someone will recognise @entity43 as we ’d really like to return him home , wherever that may be			2
