there are worse places to be on a monday morning			2
i 'm watching grazing deer while dipping a solider into a freshly laid boiled egg			2
soon , i 'm going to pull on my wellies have a totter around the vegetable garden and pet some pigs			0
if it sounds as though i 'm living an episode of @entity12 , it 's because i am			0
i 'm at @entity13 , a relatively new hotel in the rolling @entity15 in @entity16			1
the pig near @entity13 : @entity19 manor is owned by @entity20 ( previously of the @entity22 chain ) otherwise known as @entity24 , it is one of the latest period properties to come under @entity28 namesake , known for freshly picked kitchen garden cooking and a locally sourced menu			1
owner @entity20 ( previously of the @entity22 chain ) bought , renovated and reopened the hotel in march as the third in a litter of four similar venues			1
billed as a ' restaurant with rooms ' the pig near @entity13 's emphasis is on home grown food even if you are n't a foodie you may have heard of it			1
the hotel made headlines last june when a group of celebrities retired here after @entity46			2
they were a starry lot			0
@entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 all made the 30 - mile trip from the festival to play croquet , sleep , eat and party some more			1
but it 's not just a rehab for party goers			0
billed as a ' restaurant with rooms ' , the pig near @entity13 's emphasis is firmly on food			1
local produce : 80 per cent of what is on the menu comes from from within a 25 - mile radius lounge room : the @entity19 manor house is rustically charming but smart and offbeat according to @entity74 , the hotel ’s director , 80 per cent of what ’s on the plate - if it has n’t come from less than 25 metres away in the walled garden - is sourced from within a 25 - mile radius			1
‘ the garden is the heartbeat of the hotel , ’ he says showing me around a walled garden with vegetable patches , fruit cages , greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels			2
while the concept is not ground - breakingly new or unique , they do it well here			0
as we walk he picks white strawberries for me to taste ( they taste like red ones but less sickly sweet ) , three varieties of spinach are produced with a magician 's flourish and twelve types of chili pointed out			2
twelve ! we pass bushes of kale the size of a baby elephant , patches of chard , spinach , pickles , beetroot , cucumber plants , cranberries , loganberries and apple trees			0
the gardeners even cultivated watermelons this summer			0
@entity15 : the surrounding scenery is beautiful and you can go on long walks from the hotel hot hot : a greenhouse in the walled garden which grows 12 varieties of blow - your - head - off chili we pass bushes of kale the size of a baby elephant , patches of chard , spinach , pickles , beetroot and apples there are pigs for petting at the bottom of the garden , and some reared for eating nearby			1
‘ we do n’t name them , ’ @entity74 says rather ominously			0
he introduces me to chickens ( for eggs ) , quails ( likewise ) and a sprawling 20 acres of woodland and deer park that surrounds the property for 100 deer			1
the @entity19 manor house is rustically charming yet smart and offbeat with giant mounted boar ’s heads and velvet sofas			0
rows of colourful @entity157 wellies for guests to use line the front door and log fires permanently rage			0
vegetables by the bucket load : the walled garden has fruit cages , greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels too rooms start at £ 139 and rise to £ 250 a night			1
there are 29 in all and ours was vast with two large armchairs , a roll top freestanding bath and a four - poster bed			0
at £ 199 , the cost was stomachable , especially compared with overpriced @entity13 ( where smaller rooms can cost £ 1,000 ) , and the small things are done well			1
interiors have been ‘ piggified ’ by @entity20 ’s wife @entity179 , which means an oxymoron of smart shabbiness			1
like the food , the decorations are homely and hearty			2
our ‘ @entity186 ’ room had framed pressings of ferns , organic @entity190 products ( also stocked at @entity191 ) and books on how to make pigeon casserole			0
everything revolves around food : the menu changes daily depending on what 's been picked from the garden spacious : there are 29 rooms which start at £ 139 and rise to £ 250 a night for dinner i ate honey roast carrot and beetroot salad , pan fried breast of guinea fowl with sprouting broccoli and cabbage			1
most of it had been in the ground barely hours earlier			0
the kitchen is overseen by chef @entity214 and the food that comes out is seriously good and devoid of pretension			2
they smoke all their own venison , salt , butter , ham , pancetta and salmon			0
downstairs is a library stocked with @entity226 , a beautiful bar , billiards room and various spaces for , as they put it , ‘ gathering and quaffing ’			0
on the subject , a popular sharpener is the house chili or raspberry infused vodka , which was spot on			0
for the slovenly , there are two @entity238 spa rooms			2
tucked at the bottom of the walled garden , they are simple and efficient - if built as a bit of an after thought			0
@entity243 : rather than a traditional spa the hotel has two modest sheds for treatments lying on a heated bed i was rubbed with rosemary oil and kneaded like bread			2
surrounded by pots of growing beetroot , scented candles and hanging pitchforks it was not the usual sanitised spa - experience but all the better for it			0
so what of the future ? @entity74 says there are plans for another @entity264 hotel possibly in @entity265 , @entity266 or the @entity267 , but it depends on finding the right property			1
‘ hopefully we ’ll get some bees for honey soon and i ’m set on introducing a pet pig , like a dog , to the house ’ that depends on owner @entity20			1
at the moment @entity20 presides over three other ' @entity28 ' hotels ; one in @entity278 , another in @entity279 and the last little piggy which opened last may , @entity281 in @entity282			1
the pig near @entity13 is fully booked every weekend from now until june so if you want a go at the trough , you ’ll have to try sunday nights , midweek or a trip for lunch or dinner .			1

the pig near @entity13 is fully booked over weekends for the next five months
@entity49 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 are all fans
located in the @entity15 in @entity16 with sprawling deer park
80 per cent of food is produced or farmed within 25 miles of hotel
rooms start at £ 139 a night and owner @entity20 plans to open more soon
