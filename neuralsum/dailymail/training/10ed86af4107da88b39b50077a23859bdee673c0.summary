@entity1 workers plan to cripple the network next week with a 48 hour strike			2
the walkout starting next tuesday evening has been called because of a long running dispute over @entity7 's plans to close ticket offices			1
members of the @entity11 union have been instructed not to book on for any shifts between 9pm on october 14 and 8.59pm on october 16			1
the walkout threatens travel disruption in the capital and coincides with strikes by council workers and civil servants across the country in separate disputes over pay and job cuts			1
the latest phase of action in @entity11 's @entity40 campaign follows a mass meeting of reps to report back from talks with @entity1			2
the union said that although some limited progress has been made its executive has taken the view that it is not enough after months of negotiations and that the only option is to move back into a further round of strike action			0
@entity11 general secretary @entity52 said : ' @entity11 negotiators have made every effort in the long - running talks to resolve a range of issues that impact on our members jobs , their pay and working conditions and the safety of the services that they provide to the travelling public			1
' the cuts , currently being bulldozed through , would de-staff whole areas of the @entity69 at a time of surging passenger demand and would make evacuation and other basic safety procedures a physical impossibility			0
' the axing of ticket offices and station staffing grades would render the tube a no - go zone for many people with disabilities and for women travelling alone			0
the cuts ignore the realities of life that we saw when services broke down last week and the recent surveys which point to an increase in violence and sexual assaults			0
this photo was taken on the night before the february strike , where a @entity1 ticket office worker appeared to be sleeping in her chair at @entity96			1
tube bosses want to shut them so staff can help people on the concourse ' @entity11 will not stand back and allow @entity103 - driven austerity cuts to hollow out the @entity69 and leave it as a dangerous shell			1
we are also fully aware that the current cuts are just part of a multi-billion pound attack that will include such lethal ideas as driverless - operation			0
' the strike action next week is designed to force the mayor to instruct his senior officials to back away from this toxic cuts package and engage in serious and meaningful negotiations			2
' unions have been campaigning against plans to close ticket offices since they were unveiled last year			0
@entity1 say few tickets are bought at offices now , arguing that staff would be better used by being stationed on concourses .			0

@entity11 calls on members not to go to work in row over ticket office closures
the strike will last from 9pm next tuesday to 8.59pm next *thursday*
the walkout coincides with strike by public officials over pay and job cuts
