@entity3 , 69 , went to see his gp , dr @entity12 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , in june 2012 with a lump on his arm - the same arm on which he ’d had a cancer scare in 1995			1
he returned to the surgery nine weeks later and dr @entity20 could find no record of his previous visit			1
rather than make an urgent referral , the doctor diagnosed him with a ganglion - a harmless lump filled with fluid - and gave him a standard referral to attend the local hospital four weeks later			1
however , mr @entity3 knocked the lump , which had grown to the size of an egg , while at work			1
when it did n't stop bleeding , he went to @entity34 , where he was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer			1
mr @entity3 , a builder , said : ' the doctors at @entity34 said it was urgent and sent me to @entity41 hospital the next day for a biopsy			1
after examining it , they had to do an emergency operation to remove it			2
' the lump was @entity47 cell carcinoma , a very rare and aggressive form of skin cancer			1
its removal has left mr @entity3 barely able to work due to loss of power and function in his right arm			2
his daughter , @entity56 , said : ' the look on my dad ’s face when they said it was a cancerous tumour will never leave me - he was petrified			0
it ’s been a horrific time for the family			0
' after the family complained , the @entity65 for @entity66 ruled that the doctors treating mr @entity3 were guilty of serious failings			2

his daughter , @entity75 , was also given compensation for the way her complaint was handled his daughter was given £ 200 for the way her initial complaint was handled			0
ombudsman @entity82 found the first consultation was not recorded , that mr @entity3 should have been seen by the practice ’s minor surgery clinic sooner given his previous cancer scare , and that opportunities were lost to diagnose him sooner			1
the lump was @entity47 cell carcinoma , a very rare and aggressive form of skin cancer ' the failure here was in not referring mr @entity3 sooner , albeit i find that ultimately this only made two weeks difference , ' she said			1
' however , there were some fundamental and serious failures in record keeping			0
' @entity100 and @entity20 were told to apologise for their failings			0
in her report to the ombudsman , dr @entity100 said she had already closed the computer record on mr @entity3 when his arm was discussed and that she forgot to enter the details afterwards			0
she said she was ' horrified ' to learn of his diagnosis and was unable to sleep or eat for some time after , eventually leaving the practice			0
dr @entity100 has personally written to mr @entity3 ’ daughter , apologising			0
dr @entity20 said he was convinced the lump was a ganglion , which was why he had not made an urgent referral			0

he returned nine weeks later and saw a different doctor who diagnosed him with a harmless cyst and gave him a standard referral to hospital

he had to have emergency surgery to remove the tumour
