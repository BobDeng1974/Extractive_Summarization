luxury car maker @entity1 is embroiled in an extraordinary row with @entity5 bureaucrats over a decision to force all car manufacturers to use a new ' green ' air - conditioning gas the @entity27 and the @entity28 in the @entity3 are poised to suspend any new registration of the luxury @entity7 cars if they do not conform to the regulations			1
all new @entity34 hatchbacks , @entity36 family cars and @entity38 roadster models will be affected because the manufacturer has failed to agree to the law , which came into effect on january 1			2
most manufacturers have already complied with the directive			1
but last september @entity1 appealed to delay the implementation of the law			2
@entity46 tests by the company allegedly showed that ten out of 14 cars using the new coolant caught fire when subjected to conditions that simulated the coolant leaking into the engine in a front - end collision			1
but the @entity17 last week rejected the claims and warned it is not possible for new cars to be sold within the @entity5 if they do not conform to the legislation			1
implementing the directive could result in thousands of new cars being left on dealers ' forecourts , unable to be registered by the @entity27			2
in an update last week , the @entity17 said ' controversial ' testing techniques by @entity1 were to blame for the findings and the @entity65 in the @entity3 would be fined if it allowed the company to sell the affected models			2
it stated : ' it is not possible for motor vehicles to be registered and marketed in the @entity5 if they are not in conformity with the relevant legislation			1
' the @entity17 has warned any car maker refusing to install the gas faces a ban on selling cars across the continent the @entity65 said it was monitoring the situation closely , but it could cost @entity1 almost £ 500 million in lost sales in the @entity3 and more across @entity79			1
@entity1 predicts sales of about 15,000 a-class cars this year , which cost from £ 18,970			0
about 6,500 £ 21,000 b - class models and an estimated 800 of the £ 72,550 sl models are also expected to be bought by @entity3 – but all could remain unsold if the @entity27 refuses to register them for the @entity3 market			1
older models will be unaffected but from 2017 every vehicle released into the @entity79 car market must be installed with the new coolant			1
@entity91 , parent company of @entity1 , claims its tests show the new air - con chemical is ' highly flammable ' , poisonous and poses a danger to occupants and rescue services			1
the @entity17 is now involved in 11th hour talks with @entity1			0
@entity98 , which owns the @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 brands , has also refused to install the new coolant			0
however , the fellow @entity7 manufacturer has insisted its engineers have designed a new coolant using carbon dioxide which adheres to the @entity79 environmental guidelines and is in advanced talks to use the new variant			0
@entity1 claims it has instructed its engineers to design a similar chemical but the @entity17 denies knowledge of the plans			0
critics have accused @entity1 of putting costs ahead of global climate concerns because the new coolant is more expensive			0
@entity117 mep @entity116 , who helped to draft the new law , said : ' this amounts to a declaration of war on @entity91			0
it is widely believed @entity91 is trying to avoid paying extra costs of about £ 20 per vehicle			0
' the @entity17 's briefing makes clear that new models using the old refrigerant should not be sold			0
' @entity1 was last month confirmed as the leading premium brand in the @entity3			0
it registered 3,329 new cars in february – up 13.5 per cent on last year			0
professor @entity129 , from @entity91 , claimed the company was in the process of producing a new coolant using carbon dioxide which would be approved by the @entity17			0
he said : ' @entity91 has examined all possible options very closely over recent months and worked with the other manufacturers within the @entity136 ( @entity136 ) to find a solution that is acceptable to all			2
' these efforts have shown clearly that @entity140 , is by far the most promising solution , as it is environmentally acceptable and safe			0
we have given our engineers the clear commission to develop the @entity140 air - conditioning system			1
' a @entity65 spokesman said : ' the safety of all road users is paramount			0
however , we have seen no evidence that the air - conditioning fluid in this case poses any risk in appropriately designed vehicles			1
we continue to monitor this issue and the @entity17 is leading a review to ensure a consistent approach for all vehicle manufacturers and purchasers			2
' the @entity17 said it would not take action against anyone who has bought one of the affected @entity1 models since january 1			0
but a spokesman said it would continue to appeal to countries to enforce the legislation and ban future registration of all new vehicles that do not contain the new coolant gas .			2
