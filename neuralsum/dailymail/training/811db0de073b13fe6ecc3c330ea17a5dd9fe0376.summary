tragic : @entity0 , 15 , was found dead on october 10 after killing herself to escape cyber bullies @entity3 has named a man it claims posted topless pictures of a 15 - year - old girl online and harassed her so relentlessly that she killed herself			1
@entity0 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was found hanged in her home on october 10 , just weeks after she uploaded a video to @entity13 detailing her horrific treatment at the hands of cyber bullies			1
when she was just 12 , a man in an internet chat room convinced her to flash her breasts , and a year later , he plastered a picture of the incident across @entity22			1
now in a vigilante move , @entity3 , the world 's largest hacking group , has named the man allegedly responsible for the picture			1
the group claims that he is a 32 - year - old from @entity29 , but @entity30 has chosen not to identify him for legal reasons			1
as @entity34 's supporters set up @entity22 pages warning the man to ' sleep with one eye open ' , the move by @entity3 sparks concerns over its abilities to create a ' trial by internet ' - bypassing the justice system and casting guilt			1
in a video posted to @entity13 by @entity3 , a figure claims the group lists his personal information , including his date of birth and address			1
it explains that his username appears on websites where he ' blackmailed ' and gave advice to young girls			1
the same username is also tied to a website with a ' jailbait ' photo gallery			1
referring to the possibility they might have the wrong man , they add : ' at the most this is the person who did this to @entity0 , and at the least it 's another pedophile that enjoys taking advantage of children			1
' following @entity3 ' announcement , the web moved swiftly , with groups calling for his death and warning him to ' sleep with one eye open ' cropping up on @entity22			0
@entity92 reporters have unsuccessfully tried to speak with the man , and neighbours have described his home as ' a known party house on the weekend with lots of young women coming and going '			2
but police attended the home on monday after a neighbour , @entity101 , said @entity3 named the wrong address			0
he said he felt threatened by internet users and asked them to stay away			2
haunting : @entity105 posted a nine - minute video explaining her longstanding bullying on a series of notecards depressing : the story reveals that she previously tried to kill herself twice and is receiving help the @entity113 refused to confirm @entity3 have the right man but a spokesperson said they were aware that someone had been named			1
' we are aware of what ’s being posted online and certainly following up what we feel is important to follow up , ' sergeant @entity118 told @entity122 , adding : ' [ @entity123 ] run the risk of committing a criminal offence			2
' @entity34 's family members also said they are not sure the @entity3 report is accurate and said police have tracked down a person living in the @entity130 whom they believed was involved			2
the claims come weeks after @entity105 posted a nearly nine - minute @entity13 video detailing her treatment on a stack of notecards held up to the camera , @entity34 says that a year after she flashed her breasts , the man tracked her down and demanded he put on a show for him or he would expose her			1
final message : the video was posted just over a month before she was found dead on wednesday when she refused , he created a @entity22 page with a list of her friends and used her naked chest as the profile photo			2
the picture quickly spread across the internet and among her classmates			2
it led to relentless bullying online , she said , and she was diagnosed with depression and started drinking			0
in the video , posted september 7 , she admitted that she had previously tried to kill herself twice and has been hospitalised			2
after moving to a different city and school , another instance of bullying occurred after she started a romantic relationship with an older man who had a girlfriend			2
once that relationship soured , she was confronted and beaten up by the man 's girlfriend			1
she was hit in front of a crowd of screaming people who encouraged her to be left in a ditch			0
suicide : @entity34 was found hanged in her home on october 10 - just one month before her 16th birthday trouble : it came after she flashed on a webcam and the image of her topless was posted to @entity22 @entity105 does not speak in the video , and her face is not fully shown , but she confirmed her identity with the last notecard which says her name			1
one of the final images is a jarring picture of her arm which had been cut repeatedly			0
just under six weeks after posting the video , @entity34 could take the bullying no longer , and took her own life			1
during a memorial for @entity34 on monday , her friends said they have been aware of a man in his 30s ' stalking ' their friend for years			1

' i can tell you we feel we tried everything we could to help her when she came to us			0
' her death prompted a local politician to release a video of her own that pleads to put an end to bullying			2
