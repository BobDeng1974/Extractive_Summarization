it is a typical family album snap of its era – but for the 11 - year - old schoolboy on the right , being photographed would soon become a regular event			0
this 1952 picture of @entity7 in blazer and cap , with his aunt @entity10 and cousin @entity11 , is one of several being auctioned next month			1
another shows a young @entity7 pulling a funny face while on a holiday with cousin @entity11 and relatives in @entity17 in 1952			1
family snap : @entity7 aged 11 , right , with his cousin @entity11 and aunt @entity10 in @entity21 in 1952 mr @entity11 is selling the photos , along with a @entity24 guitar @entity7 gave him after he used it on @entity26 ’ 1966 hit paperback writer and which could fetch up to $ 1million ( £ 630,000 )			1
the average house price across the @entity30 is £ 189,306			2
but the auctioneers are confident the guitar will be hotly contested for by collectors because it comes with a truly extraordinary provenance			0
@entity7 gave the guitar to his cousin , @entity11 , in november 1967 , a year after @entity35 was recorded in april 1966 at @entity40 ’s @entity39 studios			1
mr @entity11 said he had fancied forming his own band and asked if he could have one of his famous relative ’s guitars on a visit to @entity7 ’s country mansion @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49			1
‘ i was just cheeky enough to ask @entity7 for one of his spare guitars , ’ he said			2
‘ i had my eye on a blue @entity54 lying in the studio , but @entity7 suggested the @entity24 and gave it to me			1
’ young joker : @entity7 , far left , pulls a funny face with @entity11 and family members in @entity17 in 1952 ride on : this photograph shows @entity7 cycling near the home of his aunt @entity63 in @entity64 in 1951 mr @entity11 has owned the guitar ever since			1
it is even more remarkable because @entity7 was photographed playing it during the @entity35 recording session , and the photograph was published in the @entity68 in june 1966			2
the photographer also took several close - up shots of the woodgrain on the guitar ’s headstock			0
experts say when these images of the wood grain are compared to the wood grain on the headstock of the actual guitar the two can be seen to match up identically			0
the guitar is being sold together with a copy of the @entity68 photograph and some charming shots from mr @entity11 ’s family album			0
while my wallet gently weeps : @entity7 's @entity24 is expected to fetch up to $ 1million ( £ 630,000 ) one of these shows a pre-fame @entity7 pulling a funny face while on a holiday with his young cousin mr @entity11 and relatives in @entity17 in 1952			1
another shows the two cousins as schoolboys in uniform with mr @entity11 ’s mother @entity96			0
a third is of an 11 - year - old @entity7 riding his bike near the home of his @entity63 , who brought him up , in @entity100 , @entity64			2
tuesday , @entity101 , of auctioneers @entity103 , said : ‘ @entity7 used to go to @entity17 during the summer holidays when he was young to stay with his aunt @entity105 and his uncle @entity107			1
‘ they then used to travel up to the @entity109 of @entity110 where they had a small cottage near the sea			0
@entity7 always spoke fondly of the time that he spent in @entity110 on his summer holidays			2
‘ it ’s true you could probably buy several houses for the cost of this guitar , but it ’s a very rare opportunity to buy a unique collectible with an iron - clad provenance			0
‘ @entity26 ’ guitars have been sold before , but they have normally been passed around so much over the years that it ’s hard to establish their origin 100 per cent			0
‘ it ’s hard to remember when a @entity7 guitar of such provenance was last sold , if ever			1
’ mr @entity101 said @entity26 ’ fanatics including rock star @entity130 , formerly of @entity131 , have been informed , but he is expecting most interest to come from private collectors in the @entity134 online bidding begins on november 14 at @entity103 , ending with a live auction on november 23 at @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity40 .			0
