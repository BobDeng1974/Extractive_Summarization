he suffers from @entity40 ’s and has moved into a home to receive round - the - clock care			1
rather than throw away his old clothes , she decided to donate them to her local charity shop			1
but as she was passing the local @entity46 on a shopping trip , she spotted the council - run recycling centre behind the store			2
the recycling area was already littered with bags because the skips were full , so she left her three bags next to one of the charity clothing bins			0
while clearing up the area of excess bags following a complaint from @entity46 , council officials identified mr @entity19 ’s donations , which contained stray personal papers with her details on			1

’ a spokesman for the @entity135 ’ @entity133 said it was ‘ astounded ’ at the treatment of mrs @entity3 , adding : ' mrs @entity3 was trying to do the right thing by giving the clothes to charity rather than throwing them away , so the council ’s reaction was completely over the top			1
