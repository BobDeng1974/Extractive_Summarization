by @entity0 if your idea of a delicious meal is anything from fish and chips to a sunday roast , you may want to look away now			0
a student in @entity10 has created a range of meals based on everyday foods , but with one major difference - they 're all produced using liquefied and blended insects			1
the @entity18 was designed by graduate @entity19 and during taste tests , diners were none the wiser			1
using the micro-factory he has created larvae pâté and a coconut - choclate flavoured dessert , and he said his project could be used to help alleviate global food shortages @entity19 's creations are n’t really designed to put chefs out of business , however - instead they 're intended as a solution to the growing problem of food shortages around the world			1
@entity19 's meals were inspired by a 2013 report by the @entity40 of the @entity41 called @entity42 , which investigated how insects could solve food shortages			1
he then constructed a micro-factory at the @entity46 where he started cooking up the dishes			2
in the ‘ kitchen ’ there are three areas			0
the main section houses larvae , which eat table scraps and then excrete onto plants , with their faeces acting as a fertiliser			1
the larvae are then harvested for eating ; they are cooked in an oven before being liquiefied in a blender			1
@entity19 mixes the blended larvae with other flavourings to make food that he says will appeal to western tastes			1
in february researchers at @entity66 unveiled their sustainable insect snacks			2
made from a mixture of dung beetles , mealworms and crickets , the researchers claimed the snacks could be developed to help feed a growing global population			0
their prototypes were apparently rich in protein and included crunch cinnamon snacks that were 3d - printed using the ground bugs			1
meanwhile , back in october 2013 students at @entity79 were awarded $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 ) to turn insects into flour			0
the goal of the project was to turn this into bread and other foods			0
the project , known as @entity88 , is hoped to provide a sustainable , year - round source of food as well as provide an extra business opportunity for local farmers			1
his creations include larvae pâté , which apparently tastes like chicken , and a coconut - chocolate flavoured dessert			1
the whole system produces zero waste , making it ideal for creating food where there are shortages			1
in addition , he says larvae contain similar amounts of protein , fat and nutrients to other forms of meat , but crucially they need they need five to ten times less food			2
@entity19 did a taste test - of sorts - to see how the public reacted to the food			2
‘ to my surprise , most of the visitors were very intrigued , especially the children , ’ he wrote on his website			0
‘ one four - year - old - girl insisted upon getting a pet fly to take home			0
’ within the insect kitchen , larvae are kept with plants and soil			2
the excrement of the larvae is used to fertilise the plants , while the larvae are ultimately harvested for use in the food			1
the entire micro-factory produces zero waste and the larvae require five to ten times less food to produce the same nutrients as other forms of meat the larvae are cooked inside an oven before being liquefied in a blender			1
@entity19 then combines this with other ingredients such as spices in order to make the taste more appealing to western cultures			0
he claims there is no bug - like taste and , in fact , some of the foods actually taste like chicken but , he conceded , even though ‘ most people are very interested in the project and its prospects ’ not everyone was willing to try the food			1
‘ it is very probable that elements of the project will be developed for further production in an industrial setting , ’ he continues			0
this could include fish feeding initiatives			0
‘ as far as this project goes my hope is that it will be made available for research and further development			0
‘ one of the big aspects of this project is to invoke interest in the circular production visible in nature			0
‘ this idea of a waste-less production will hopefully inspire others to rethink linear production which produces great amounts of waste and unused by - products			2
’ after baking the final mixture in an oven , @entity19 then has his final product			0
this is an image of the larvae paté			0
@entity19 hopes his project can inspire research and development in the field of using insects as food in order to tackle the growing problem of feeding @entity196 's population			2

an @entity10 graduate student has created food using liquefied larvae
the @entity18 keeps insects in a sustainable *environment* with plants
the zero - waste micro-factory fertilises the plants with larvae excrement
when the larvae are cooked they are combined with other ingredients
finished food includes larvae pâté - which apparently tastes like chicken
