apollo 17 commander @entity0 , the last man on the moon , has revealed he left a camera on the lunar surface , hoping it would be recovered by future astronauts to measure radiation levels			1
the camera , a @entity7 used to capture many of the iconic images from the mission , was left with its lens pointing into space			1
@entity0 had hoped it could be used as the mission 's final experiment , with future astronauts measuring the radiation collected on the lens			1
astronaut @entity0 on the moon on december 19 , 1972			1
today he revealed he left a camera on the lunar surface , hoping future astronauts would recover it			2
speaking on the 40th anniversary of the mission , @entity0 expressed regret his footprints are still the last left on the moon			1
now 78 , he told @entity26 he thought his voyage ' was n't the end but the beginning ' for manned @entity30 - and that he thought an astronaut would have set foot on @entity33 by the end of the century			2
the @entity36 programme cost @entity38 taxpayers more than $ 150 billion ( £ 93 billion ) in today 's money			0
however , after @entity42 's @entity41 crew reached the moon and ended the space race , support among the @entity38 public waned and turned towards the @entity46			0
this led to scathing budget cuts for @entity49 , with dozens of projects cancelled and three @entity36 missions cancelled			0
three further missions planned to follow @entity0 's crew were scrapped due to budget cuts			1
now , he admits leaving his camera may have been a mistake			2
' i left my @entity7 camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith , the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass			1
' so , going up the ladder , i never took a photo of my last footstep			0
how dumb ! ' would n’t it have been better to take the camera with me , get the shot , take the film pack off and then ( for weight restrictions ) throw the camera away ? ' a @entity7 500 camera similar to those used by the @entity36 17 astronauts			2
commander @entity0 has revealed he left his on the lunar surface ' how dumb ' : captain @entity0 , commander of @entity79 mission , pictured left alongside @entity80 , chairman of the @entity81 , now says he regrets leaving his camera he called for manned space exploration programmes to be accelerated			1
' i do think we need to go to the moon first to set up a base so we can use more advanced propulsion techniques , ' he said			0
' am i willing to go to @entity33 ? yes , but i ’m not willing to spend nine months getting there , then wait 18 more months until the planets align to come home			0
' for @entity33 we need propulsion technologies to get us there in say , 60 days , then spend whatever length of time we want to spend – two months , six months – and return when we want to come home			0
' that will require ion and nuclear propulsion and help from a base on the moon			0

@entity0 had hoped camera could be used to *analyse* radiation levels when recovered by the next *visitors*
