@entity0 stood in disbelief after rocking back to play his favoured pull but only succeeded in bottom edging @entity4 and seeing the ball cannon into his stumps			0
it was the lowest point of the worst day of his captaincy			0
when @entity0 was churning out hundred after hundred he would simply have despatched the ball to the boundary but now , woefully out of form and fighting for his captaincy life , even the shot that has earned him a huge chunk of his 8,000 plus @entity19 runs had badly let him down			0
when nightwatchman @entity32 tamely lobbed @entity33 to cover off what became the last ball of the day @entity27 ’s misery was almost complete			0
at 57 for five chasing a massive 350 to win this second test and the @entity40 series they face a humiliating and hugely damaging defeat			1
there were many dark days during a winter when @entity27 were taken apart by @entity44 but this is surely as bad as it can get for a captain who survived the mass cull that greeted a 5 - 0 ashes whitewash			2
disappointment : captain @entity0 failed again as he was bowled for 16 in the second innings a two - test home series against @entity23 was meant to provide a gentle start to the new era , a chance for @entity27 to regroup and for @entity0 to prove that he can mould a team in his image and lead @entity27 forward positively			1
instead , barring a miracle even beyond 1981 on this ground , it will turn into @entity23 ’s historic first test series win in @entity27 to complete a clean sweep after their victories in the @entity65 international and the one - day series			1
that will be a crushing blow for @entity27 ’s new regime , not least a captain in @entity0 who will now go into a high profile series against @entity72 under enormous pressure			1
if he gets that far			0
it is not inconceivable , with @entity27 a rabble under his leadership on monday , that @entity0 will now fall on his sword			2
setback : @entity27 's @entity21 was quickly sent back to the pavilion @entity27 have invested hugely in @entity0 and will unquestionably want to give him a lot more time than this but to be outclassed by @entity23 and their supposedly pop gun attack at home will seriously test the @entity85 's loyalty and belief			1
remember , @entity27 dominated the bulk of the first two days of this test having come within one wicket of winning the first but the transformation since @entity27 were coasting at 311 for three in reply to @entity23 ’s 257 has been total			1
@entity23 , supposedly the warm - up for the main @entity95 act , have been sensational under their highly impressive captain in @entity22 and have proved their quality and toughness here but there is no excuse for @entity27			1
got him : @entity27 's @entity25 was trapped lbw without scoring they were pathetic from the moment @entity0 allowed @entity23 to milk another 40 runs from the remaining seven overs with the old ball without looking to take wickets to the bitter end with @entity32 ’s comical demise			1
there can be no sparing of a captain who lacked any sense of tactical acumen in the field while his opposite number scored his second consecutive hundred and then carried on his long spell without a century of his own			0
@entity27 were still in this match when @entity32 took two wickets in consecutive balls for the second time in this test to leave @entity23 169 ahead with only three wickets left			1
but their hopes were soon painfully dashed			0
late blow : @entity23 celebrate the dismissal of nightwatchman @entity32 @entity0 had refused to attack @entity22 from the moment @entity128 fell , instead trying to target the tail , and allowed him to move from his overnight 24 to a priceless 160 for @entity23 , principally in a stand of 149 with @entity33			1
most baffling was @entity0 ’s refusal to turn to @entity133 for the bulk of that stand between lunch and tea even though he had taken the wickets of two key left - handers on sunday and was facing a third in @entity140 who has a history of swishing at off - spinners			0
instead @entity144 and @entity145 , who will be crucial when @entity27 face those five tests in six weeks against @entity72 , were flogged into the ground while @entity148 struggled to make an impact in his second test			0
impressive : @entity27 paceman @entity32 finished with math haul of nine wickets @entity27 , who squandered seven chances in the @entity156 first innings and another crucial one at the start of their second , were again culpable in their own demise , dropping three more chances and wasting their two reviews			0
most crucial was @entity32 spilling @entity22 on 87 off his own bowling while @entity27 ’s lack of judgment over reviews was exposed when umpire @entity166 missed a clear edge from @entity168 off a steaming @entity144			2
@entity166 had almost as bad a day as @entity0 , later giving two palpably wrong caught behind decisions against @entity27 that were both overturned , with the suspicion that the words he exchanged with @entity144 had affected his judgment			2
yet the umpire will not affect the outcome and some time on tuesday , probably sooner rather than later , @entity27 will be faced with another bout of soul - searching just as difficult as anything they encountered last winter			0
this @entity27 team are firmly behind @entity0 and the leadership alternatives to him are probably restricted to @entity21 or @entity178 but the captain will have much thinking to do when he returns to his family farm away from @entity183 ’s unforgiving glare			1
it was not meant to be like this			0
frustrating : @entity23 's @entity33 shared an eighth - wicket stand of 149 with @entity22 dismissed : @entity33 's excellent knock ended when he was run out for 48			2
