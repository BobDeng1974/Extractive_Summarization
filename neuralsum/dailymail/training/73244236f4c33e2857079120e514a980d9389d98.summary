towards the end of his press conference at @entity3 yesterday , @entity0 was asked by a presenter from children ’s television whether he thought youngsters in @entity8 should be allowed to stay up for wednesday 's game against @entity10			1
@entity11 can be an obtuse man but on this he was unequivocal			1
‘ i would always allow my children to watch the match because this is absolutely unique , ’ said the @entity8 coach			1
‘ look at the impact of the @entity17 at a global level - and this is a semi-final			1
i would strongly advise parents to let them watch the match			1
’ in @entity8 , they are just glad to have these decisions to make			1
this was supposed to be a @entity17 of limited horizons for @entity11 and his functional ( his own word ) team			1
yet , here we are and the @entity38 are still in town , preparing for a classic fixture to conjure memories of the 1978 final - won by @entity10 in their own country - and a 1998 quarter - final , won by @entity8 in @entity44			1
those games , of course , featured defining contributions by genuine superstars			0
@entity49 scored the opening goal in @entity51 while @entity52 settled the meeting in @entity54 with perhaps the best goal of his stellar career in the final minute			0
tonight in mild , damp @entity27 , we have the opportunity to witness greatness once again			0
the deposed @entity59 , @entity21 , has approached this month in @entity60 as if intent on proving people were wrong to give this year ’s title to @entity64			1
so far , he has done a pretty reasonable job and without him @entity10 would certainly no longer be here			1
celebration : @entity52 is overjoyed after scoring the winning goal against @entity10 in 1998 plan : @entity11 says that he has prepared the way to play against @entity10 and @entity21 ball skills : @entity71 in training ahead of @entity8 's @entity17 semi-final with @entity10 moving on up : quarter - final penalty hero @entity74 ( centre ) and @entity11 ( right ) walk out for training even @entity21 , though , would struggle to shift @entity8 ’s @entity77 as player of the tournament in most people ’s minds			1
the @entity83 forward has taken his game to new levels in @entity86 and it is perhaps not surprising that @entity10 appear to be approaching this game with some rather rudimentary ideas about how to stop him			2
‘ we have to be aggressive , to show the passion of the @entity94 players to the @entity38 - and especially to @entity77 , ’ said @entity96 defender @entity95			1
‘ he does n’t like physical contact , so you have to make him feel it and get under his skin			0
he is a phenomenon but he ’s not got much edge , he ’s not a fighter			0
therefore you have to attack him			0
’ @entity95 and @entity77 played together at @entity83 in 2009 - 10			1
maybe the @entity86 has n’t been watching his old club mate closely out here , however , as the @entity77 of summer 2014 has shown as much courage as any forward in this tournament			2
last saturday , four of @entity110 ’s back five were booked for crude , hacking fouls on @entity77			2
still , he strode forward			0
if @entity10 are to stop him tonight , they will need to find a cuter way			2
‘ it ’s ridiculous how much he is fouled , ’ said @entity38 midfielder @entity117			0
‘ they foul him because they ca n’t find another way			0
he is too good for most			0
’ @entity123 : @entity21 highlights dangerman : @entity11 says that his team have a plan and must be prepared for @entity21 star : but in @entity8 arguably have the player of the tournament so far stretch : @entity77 has shone in @entity60 and has only got better as the tournament has progressed it may seem rich to hear members of @entity8 ’s derided 2010 @entity17 final team moan about treatment afforded one of their own , given the way @entity139 and others kicked the @entity141 midfield all over @entity142 four years ago			1
certainly , they will seek other ways to neutralise @entity21 on wednesday			2
@entity11 ’s @entity8 are different in their approach from the team shaped by @entity148 and yesterday the current manager did his best to play down questions about @entity152 ’s magician			1
‘ we are playing against @entity10 and we always refer to teams and not individual players , ’ said @entity11			1
‘ we have a plan ready for @entity10			2
we showed the players @entity10 this morning			2
@entity21 was once elected best footballer in the world			2
there ’s a reason for that			0
if you score so many goals , you have an added value			0
‘ at the most important stage he can always pull it off but in principle he ’s always found it difficult to show that at an international level			0
he wants to do that at this tournament and we want to stop him doing that , so that ’s going to be quite a challenge			0
’ focused : the @entity8 squad train ahead of their @entity17 semi-final with @entity10 team talk : @entity11 talks with his players during their training session in @entity27 @entity180 : @entity181 highlights @entity38 training contained some surprises on tuesday as @entity139 , struggling with a groin injury , joined in and @entity185 , who had a stomach bug , did not			1
we can expect the latter to start , however , and he is already looking ahead			0
‘ playing against @entity10 is not a dream , ’ said @entity189			2
‘ it does n’t interest me at all			0
we just have to win			0
a dream is to grab hold of that cup			0
' @entity38 confidence is clearly high			0
parents in @entity197 and beyond should perhaps start planning ahead because if they win they will face their rampant @entity199 rivals on sunday .			1

@entity11 believes children should be allowed to stay up by their parents in @entity8 and watch this ' absolutely unique ' match
@entity8 manager says he has an idea of how to best deal with @entity21
@entity10 will be ' aggressive ' to deal with @entity8 star @entity77
the winner will face @entity210 at the @entity211 in the final on sunday
@entity210 *demolished* @entity60 7 - 1 in other semi-final in @entity215
