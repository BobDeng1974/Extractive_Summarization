by @entity0 published : 13:27 est , 30 november 2013 updated : 14:19 est , 30 november 2013 a @entity2 couple claim their desperately ill newborn son was denied a heart transplant by hospital because he suffers a mental disability			1
@entity8 , 32 , and her boyfriend , @entity9 , allege that @entity10 in @entity11 refused to put their child , @entity13 , onto a transplant list because he had a rare genetic defect			1
refusing to believe that their sons @entity17 syndrome was a valid reason not to put him on the transplant list , @entity8 and @entity9 embarked on a month - long battle to get @entity13 treatment - culminating in a fateful trip to @entity25 in june			1
scroll down for @entity26 recovery : marverick at home in @entity2 in his mother , @entity32 arms - as he recovers from his life threatening heart failure named after @entity37 's fighter pilot character in @entity13 , little @entity13 was born with a severe heart defect in @entity11 in september of 2012			1
he had his first surgery at the age of 4 - days old at @entity42 , a part of the @entity2 - presbyterian system and was kept in intensive care through @entity46			2
however , his condition began to deteriorate and by march he was fast running out of options			2
it was a god - send for his parents when he was accepted as an eligible transplant candidate on march 18th , but just two days later everything changed			1
disgust : @entity8 and @entity9 were distraught to be told by @entity10 refused their child for a heart transplant in march loving mother : autumn with @entity13 as he recovered in hospital in @entity2 as he descended into heart failure after his birth in september 2012 @entity9 and @entity8 were called into a hospital conference room and informed that their son had been diagnosed with @entity17 syndrome			1
the disease causes children to grow up with intellectual and development disabilities as compared to other children			0
according to a recent study , babies with @entity17 sit , walk , and speak later than other children on average			0
fewer than 100 cases of @entity17 have been reported worldwide since it was identified in the 1970s			0
on march 22nd , another meeting was convened by the doctors and @entity8 and @entity9 were told that their son was no longer considered a candidate for transplant			1
doctors said that those with @entity17 tend to have compromised immune systems and are also at risk for tumors and infections according to a report from @entity86			2
@entity8 and @entity9 were told that because of this any transplant would be too risky and therefore he was sadly being taken off the list			1
his medical record includes a note about the meeting , signed by dr. @entity93 , medical director of @entity95 's pediatric cardiac transplant program			2
' his genetic defect is associated with increased infections and tumors , which would be greatly magnified combined with the immunosuppression involved in transplantation , ' the note said			2
' i discussed that this does not mean we are giving up on @entity13 , but trying to improve his heart failure as best as possible and get him to gain weight			2
' happy : @entity9 and @entity32 with @entity13 at home in @entity2 after returning from hospital in @entity25 after successful treatment however , according to @entity32 , the doctors were cold and told her that she should simply enjoy the time she had left with her son			1
stunned , shocked and distraught by the news , @entity8 suspected that doctors were not giving her son a chance			1
she emailed the author of the @entity119 study which @entity2 - @entity95 physicians cited as a reason for not giving @entity13 the chance of a transplant			0
dr. @entity124 at @entity125 in the @entity119 wrote back saying catergorically that children with @entity17 do not have compromised immune systems			0
' it is difficult to use infection risk as a reason not to perform a heart transplant , ' said dr. @entity124 to @entity86			2
more to the point , @entity32 opened up a dialogue with dr. @entity134 - who along with dr. @entity135 discovered the syndrome in 1970 at the @entity137			0
' @entity17 is not a reason to say no to a transplant , ' said dr. @entity134			0
' i would say it 's wrong to do so			0
' presbyterian still would n't budge			0
they insisted they would not give @entity13 a transplant			0
@entity8 called another meeting on april 12 , when @entity13 was 6 months old and doctors repreated their position that there would be no transplant			1
sick : @entity13 has the genetic condition @entity17 - which can lead to developmental issues with children as they grow older @entity8 said that the doctors even looked at their watches to indicate that they had somewhere else they would rather be and left as she began to sob			1
' the more i fought , the less they listened , ' she said			0
' but i knew that going home to die was not his fate , ' said @entity8			1
refusing to let their son died , @entity9 and @entity8 tried to get him a transplant and contacted @entity163 , the @entity164 and @entity165			1
on may 6 they were turned down by @entity163 and a few days after that by the @entity164			0
desperate , @entity8 and @entity9 drove to @entity25 to speak face to face with the doctors there to save their sons life			1
they got what they wanted on @entity174 , @entity13 was taken by ambulance from @entity2 to @entity25 where he was prepared for surgery			0
his medications were changed and his weight increased			0
@entity13 's condition improved and amazingly on june 7 , doctors called in @entity32 and @entity9 and told them that their son would not be getting a transplant			1
this time however , it was n't because of his medical prognosis it was because he did n't need one anymore			0
' i felt like the weight of the world had been taken off my shoulders , ' she said			0
' the difference between @entity25 and all the other hospitals is the way they cared -- the fact that they cared , ' she said			0
@entity9 and @entity8 have filed a complaint againt @entity198			1
' the hospital first said the decision was based on @entity13 being at a heightened risk for tumors and infection			0
we later learned that this was false information and that @entity13 is not at a heightened risk for tumors or infection , ' @entity9 wrote in the complaint according to @entity86 .			2
