by @entity0 published : 10:43 est , 12 december 2013 updated : 20:45 est , 12 december 2013 the sons of an @entity3 expatriate who left his £ 389,000 fortune to the @entity5 are fighting to claw back the money at the @entity7			1
@entity8 , 81 , died in @entity9 having bequeathed his entire estate outside @entity11 to the far - right @entity5			1
this left his two sons , @entity14 and @entity15 , with just £ 135 between them			1
they launched a legal challenge , insisting that their father was barred from giving money to a @entity21 political party under rules designed to prevent donations from ‘ foreigners ’			1
family row : @entity8 left his £ 389,000 estate to the @entity5 and his sons are fighting to have it for themselves claiming he lost his voting rights , making the donation illegal , the @entity7 heard but the @entity5 is now challenging the sons ’ claims in court			1
arguments : judge @entity35 heard mr @entity8 left his sons just £ 135 judge @entity36 heard that mr @entity8 – who was born in @entity37 , @entity38 – moved to @entity9 after retiring in 1992			1
four years later he made a will leaving the @entity5 all his worldly goods except a @entity11 bank account containing just £ 135 , which he bequeathed to @entity14			1
but the @entity5 ran into trouble when it tried to lay its hands on the gift , after mr @entity8 ’s sons claimed he was not legally allowed to make the donation			1
they argued that the expatriate – who divorced their mother in the 1970s – failed to register on the @entity21 electoral roll in the five years before his death in 2010 , the judge heard			2
that meant he was barred from making the gift under rules introduced in 2000 to curb foreign donations to @entity21 political parties			2
@entity60 , for the sons , told the judge that mr @entity8 effectively died intestate and that his whole fortune ought to be handed to them , despite his wishes			1
but @entity65 , representing @entity5 treasurer @entity66 , argued that the party had overcome the problem by executing a deed of variation to the will			2
this meant the money would paid into a specially set - up charitable trust , rather than directly to the party			0
the charity ’s trustees are mr @entity66 , former leading @entity79 member @entity78 and @entity80 , the daughter of @entity5 leader @entity81			0
new life : mr @entity8 moved to @entity9 ( pictured ) on his retirement in 1992 after divorcing his sons ' mother mr @entity60 insisted , however , that moving the cash into the trust would make no difference and could not legitimise an ‘ illegal ’ political donation			1
he said the party was obliged to pay the money back under the @entity92			0
the @entity5 , represented by party treasurer , @entity66 ( pictured ) , says the idea their father became a ' foreigner ' in the eyes of the law by the time he died is inconceivable ‘ the @entity5 is not entitled to the gift under this will , ’ he said			1
‘ it does not have the lawful capacity under the @entity92 to accept this gift			0
the gift fails and there is an intestacy			0
’ mr @entity60 told the court that as the party ’s treasurer , mr @entity66 could theoretically face prosecution if it was found to have accepted the payment illegally			0
addressing the judge in person , the @entity5 ’s mr @entity78 argued that it would be ‘ utterly unjust ’ for the party to be stripped of the money bequeathed to it			2
‘ one son was given nothing and the other was given less than £ 150 , ’ he said			0
‘ it seems pretty clear that the father did n’t want the bulk of his estate to go to his two sons – he wanted it to go to a political party			1
‘ mr @entity8 had every right to be on the electoral register but , for whatever reason , he was unaware of the provision that he had to be			0
the pathway can never lead to the sons			0
’ denying that the party is fighting the case as it is badly in need of funds , he added : ‘ the @entity5 has received sizeable legacies as its support base tends to be amongst older people			2
it is not desperate for money			0
’ giving his preliminary views on the dispute , judge @entity35 said : ‘ if the @entity5 had investigated whether or not mr @entity8 was a permitted donor there would be no need for this hearing			2
’ he reserved his decision until a later date			0
neither of mr @entity8 ’s sons attended the hearing			0
their barrister was unable to comment on why their father had decided to effectively write them out of his will .			0

@entity8 moved to @entity9 in 1992 and in 2010 estate left to @entity5
his sons @entity14 and @entity15 were handed £ *67.50* each in disputed will
they say father was not registered to vote in @entity21 so can not donate to @entity5
political party say sons are *wrongly* trying to block father *'s* dying wish
