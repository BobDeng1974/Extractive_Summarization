by @entity0 published : 19:13 est , 19 june 2012 updated : 04:37 est , 20 june 2012 controversial : brilliant historian @entity2 's 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for @entity5 ¿ s crimes			1
in @entity8 s opinion , the killer was simply the victim of her childhood four years after 11 - year - old @entity5 was convicted of killing two small boys ( aged three and four ) , i interviewed her mother @entity12 for @entity15 ’s @entity14 programme in a shabby hotel room in @entity17			1
she had been persuaded by writer @entity2 to help promote her book about the killer schoolgirl which was called the case of @entity5			1
in a hesitant performance , @entity5 ’s mother admitted that , as a child , her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle , which included drug - taking			1
@entity2 believed that those awful experiences had contributed to @entity5 ’s pathological behaviour			1
@entity2 , who has just died at the age of 91 , was understandably pleased with her scoop			1
the @entity5 story had gripped @entity32 in 1968			1
during her trial , experts testified that she had shown no remorse or anxiety and shed no tears for her crimes			2
her lack of emotion and evidence of her previous violence towards babies and animals had staggered the court			0
it was no surprise that people wanted an explanation as to why a young girl could behave in such a depraved way			0
step forward the brilliant historian @entity2 , whose 1972 book tried to argue that society was to blame for @entity5 ’s crimes			1
in @entity2 ’s opinion , the killer was simply the victim of her childhood			1
she recounted @entity5 ’s uncorroborated claims that she had been sexually abused by her prostitute mother and her mother ’s clients			1
this led @entity2 to contend this abuse was irrefutably the cause of @entity5 ’s murderous behaviour			1
such analysis was typical of the growing cult of victimhood , which saw criminals as prisoners of their upbringing who were therefore incapable of making moral judgments			0
the ‘ unfortunate ’ @entity5 had become a monster because of her allegedly terrible childhood			1
@entity5 , pictured , was convicted of horrific child murders			1
@entity5 's mother @entity12 admitted that , as a child , her daughter had witnessed her own sordid lifestyle , which included drug - taking to blame were her teachers , the police , social workers and even her neighbours			1
according to @entity2 , everyone bore responsibility except the killer herself			1
at the time , this view was embraced unquestionably by @entity32 ’s increasingly liberal ruling elite			0
@entity2 had managed to humanise a monster			1
this was helped by the confessions of @entity5 ’s mother and @entity2 ’s description of a rigid legal system and an uncomprehending judge who — when sentencing @entity5 to ‘ life in detention ’ — said she was ‘ dangerous and remained a grave risk to other children ’			1
later , it was revealed @entity5 had been paid £ 50,000 for her collaboration — bringing a storm of new criticism down on @entity2 ’s head			1
undaunted , she remained in touch with @entity5 throughout her 12 years in prison and at the secret address where — hiding behind a new identity — the killer subsequently enjoyed her freedom			1
@entity2 ’s remarkable skills and her ‘ pursuit of the truth ’ led her to write several other studies of evil			1
these included gripping biographies of two of @entity122 ’s henchmen , @entity120 and @entity123			0
as with @entity5 , she endeavoured to explain away their monstrous behaviour as the result of circumstances beyond their control			2
new theory : @entity120 , right , was convicted at @entity130 for war crimes			2
@entity2 claimed in a novel that his monstrous behaviour was a result of circumstances beyond his control @entity2 ’s credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in @entity138 and her heavily accented @entity139 reminded many of @entity141 , the father of psychoanalysis			1
in 1938 , soon after @entity122 ’s occupation of @entity145 , @entity2 ’s family fled to @entity146			2
unlike most @entity148 survivors of the @entity149 , she was fascinated by the perpetrators of mass murder			2
one intriguing aspect of @entity2 was the way she denied her @entity148 roots			1
when she returned to @entity155 from the @entity156 after the war in 1945 , she claimed she was a @entity158			0
she angrily denied she was @entity148 — a key reason why she had been forced to leave @entity138 in the first place			1
the truth is that on the morning of march 16 , 1938 — alongside my own mother — she had been physically kicked out of @entity165 ’s school by fellow students wearing swastika armbands			0
@entity2 was a brave woman but the denial of her @entity148 past put a question mark over her illustrious career as she sought to understand the state of the minds of the murderers who persecuted her people			1
similar : @entity8 s credibility was boosted by the fact she was brought up in @entity138 and her heavily accented @entity139 reminded many of @entity141 , the father of psychoanalysis inspired by a description of @entity182 ’s trial in @entity183 in 1961 , in which one of an architects of the @entity186 was described as the embodiment of ‘ the banality of evil ’ , @entity2 attended the trial in @entity191 of @entity123 , the commander of two extermination camps — @entity193 and @entity194 — where he organised the murder of 1,250,000 @entity148			1
like many @entity198 murderers , @entity123 escaped after the war to @entity200 , where he lived until he was exposed			0
extradited to @entity201 , he was jailed for life			0
@entity2 persuaded him to give her a series of interviews for a biography			2
the fascinating result showed how an intelligent but unremarkable @entity145 policeman had been inducted into the @entity198 murder machine			0
@entity123 ’s inhumanity was encapsulated in his admission that he regarded the hapless people who arrived daily at the death camps by train as ‘ cargo ’			0
his horrifying insensitivity and lack of conscience was justified by a monstrous lie : ‘ it was a matter of my survival			0
' what i had to do to get out			0
’ inspired by the trial of @entity223 , pictured , @entity2 attended the trial in @entity191 of @entity123 , the commander of two extermination camps @entity2 was accused of being more sympathetic to the villain than to his victims — a criticism that would return years later with her depiction of @entity5			1
murderers , she argued , were the products of their environment and therefore not totally responsible for their crimes			2
like @entity5 , @entity235 had lacked the ‘ freedom to grow : within family , within human society as a whole			1
’ @entity123 ’s father was a ‘ dragoner ’ — one of the imperial elite regiments of the @entity201 army			0
he told @entity2 : ‘ our lives were run on regimental lines			2
i was scared to death of him			0
’ to her credit , she recorded @entity235 ’s post-war confession : ‘ everything i did out of my own free will			0
’ but , then , she cast doubt on his self - awareness			0
she concluded that he was not a perpetrator of evil but a victim of his childhood			0
‘ a moral monster , ’ she wrote , ‘ is not born but is produced by interference with this growth			0
’ both @entity5 and @entity123 were therefore victims of ‘ a climate of life ’			2
this misguided obsession with the denial of personal responsibility reached a climax in her biography — critics would say hagiography — of @entity122 ’s favourite architect @entity120			2
it even led to accusations that she was a @entity198 sympathiser			0
@entity120 was the @entity198 minister of armaments			0
it was he who presented the @entity278 with a grandiose vision for rebuilding @entity280 as a city befitting a conqueror ’s @entity198			0
he dramatically increased the manufacture of weapons			0
this was achieved as a result of @entity120 ’s use of prisoners of war and 7.5 million slave labourers			0
misguided : @entity2 defended @entity122 henchman @entity120			2
this even led to accusations that she was a @entity198 sympathiser he was also responsible for the eviction of up to 70,000 @entity148 from their homes in @entity280 from where they were taken to ghettoes and execution camps			2
prosecuted at @entity130 with other @entity198 leaders , @entity120 brilliantly set himself apart by playing the middle - class apologist who was ignorant of @entity122 ’s genocide plans			0
after 20 years in prison , @entity120 produced a manuscript — inside @entity198 — in which he outrageously painted himself as a conscious - stricken bystander to @entity198 crimes unaware of the @entity186			0
pandering to that cynical distortion of the truth , @entity2 gained access to him and produced a biography sub-titled @entity311			2
shockingly , she depicted the thug as ‘ unique among @entity122 ’s men in the integrity of his battle of conscience ’			0
here was another killer whose crimes , for @entity2 , could be explained and occasionally even excused			1
in her world of rampant psycho - babble , she claimed @entity120 ’s abusive parents had prompted his search for a father figure which , in turn , fatally led him to @entity122			0
portraying him as a beguiled innocent , @entity2 wrote about @entity120 ’s ‘ aesthetic perception ’ , ‘ inner awareness ’ and ‘ moral guilt ’ but never his calculated participation in killing			2
in humanising monsters , @entity2 was a major force in creating a very modern and corrosive ideology that architects of evil should not be punished but understood and even rewarded to help them atone for their sins			2
worse still , we are left with a society more likely — not less — to breed such monsters in the future .			0

@entity2 tried to claim society was to blame for child murderer @entity5 's crimes
credibility boosted by the fact she was brought up in @entity138 and her heavily accented @entity139
brave woman but denial of @entity148 past put question mark over her career
