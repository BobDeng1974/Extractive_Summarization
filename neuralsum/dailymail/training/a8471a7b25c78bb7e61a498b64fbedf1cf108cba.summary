by @entity0 more than a third of adults now have borderline diabetes – caused by a rising tide of obesity , a major study shows today			1
researchers calculate that 14million people in @entity9 have ‘ prediabetes ’ – three times the number since 2006			1
the group have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering the full - blown illness and at a higher risk of complications such as kidney failure , nerve damage and sight problems			0
crucially , many could prevent both prediabetes and the full illness by making small lifestyle changes to lose weight and exercise more			2
academics say that up to 10 per cent of borderline cases may now go on to develop the type 2 version of diabetes every year , although it is not known how many will get it over the course of their lifetime			1
in the first study of its kind , academics from the universities of @entity48 and @entity49 estimated the prevalence of prediabetes , defined by blood sugar levels of between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent			1
diabetics are above 6.5 per cent and normal people are between 4 per cent and 5.6 per cent			1
health risk : ' @entity59 ' have blood sugar levels that are so high they are on the verge of suffering full - blown diabetes using a sample of 20,000 adults from the government ’s annual @entity67 , scientists found that 35.3 per cent had prediabetes in 2011			1
the figure is up from 11.6 per cent in 2003 , 20.4 per cent in 2006 and 32.6 per cent in 2009			0
they also found that just over half of adults – 50.6 per cent – who were overweight or obese had the condition			1
the study , published in the @entity77 , comes amid rising concerns over the costs of diabetes to the @entity81 , which spends £ 10billion a year – a tenth of its budget – on treatment			1
because of the lack of symptoms , researchers are now urging anyone who is overweight or obese to undergo blood sugar tests with their gp			0
study leader professor @entity90 , of the @entity91 , said : ‘ it ’s very important we detect people early			0
it ’s about exercise and calorie restriction – most of these people are overweight and obese			2
‘ you wo n’t just slow the onset of diabetes , you can also go back to normal glycaemic level [ blood sugar ]			0
you can actually get back to normal			0
‘ what we really do n’t want is people to progress to diabetes as then we are looking at higher levels of kidney disease , heart disease and eye problems			2
’ if the findings of the study are true for the entire population of @entity9 then more than 14.4million adults have prediabetes			1
@entity116 , of the charity @entity117 , said : ‘ unless we make people aware of their risk of @entity121 diabetes and support them in changing their lifestyles , we could see an even greater increase in the number of people with the condition			2
’ @entity128 ’s estimated 3.8million diabetics are estimated to climb to 5million by 2025 – largely as a result of obesity and the ageing population			0
last month former @entity81 boss sir @entity132 revealed how he had developed the illness after years of eating fried breakfasts and binge drinking			0
and health service figures show that up to one in three hospital beds are taken up by diabetics			0
professor @entity141 of @entity9 said action from manufacturers and retailers to reduce the calories , fat and sugar content of foods could be among the ways to reverse the rising numbers of sufferers			2
‘ no single action will tackle this issue alone , ’ he added .			0

an estimated 14 million people in @entity9 have borderline diabetes
up to 10 per cent could go on to develop diabetes every year
just over half of overweight adults in @entity9 have ' prediabetes '
