@entity0 said @entity1 should try and copy @entity3 ’s system , but the difference with @entity3 is they always have short passing options in midfield			1
on friday night in the first half there was too big a gap between @entity10 , @entity11 and the front four			0
if you have two midfielders sitting then you need five or 10 - yard passing options in front of them to move the ball quickly			2
there were moments of quality — @entity19 ’s goal was outstanding — and things improved in the second half but there were too many straight , long passes			0
@entity1 looked much better when there were more short options			1
get the @entity41 if @entity1 want to play wide midfielders that cut inside , then it ’s vital @entity45 and @entity46 get further forward to provide numbers higher up			1
without an overlap it ’s easy for opposition defenders to stick with their man and crowd out attacks			0
the full backs need to give that width quickly , and @entity56 will hope that @entity45 stays fighting fit for @entity58			1
flying down the wing : @entity1 full - backs @entity46 ( left ) and @entity45 need to get further forward @entity1 have now won their last seven friendlies before a major tournament @entity63 ? the side @entity65 went with on friday night could well be the team that ends up starting against @entity66 in @entity67			1
in my experience , managers tend to pick their first xi in the first warm - up match and then use the rest of the squad in the later friendly games			2
often they then revert to that first side for the tournament opener			0
it happened in 1998 and again in 2002			0
if @entity56 follows suit , do n’t be surprised if the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 side that started last night starts against @entity66			1
pensive : @entity1 manager @entity65 looks on as he watches his side beat @entity24 3 - 0 starting @entity83 is @entity84 's next big task taking @entity86 over @entity87 was @entity56 ’s biggest selection decision so far , but now he faces another one			1
how can he fit @entity83 into his starting line - up ? the front four did not quite click			2
when @entity91 drops deep he needs options but there were not enough for him on friday night			2
@entity83 might be used as a substitute for a tiring @entity91 but the way he finished the season means he has to be a contender to start			0
he is such a slippery dribbler and when he came on he made things happen			0
darting through : @entity83 goes between @entity100 ( left ) and @entity101 ( right )			0

@entity1 looked much better when there were more short options
it is vital that @entity46 and @entity45 get further forward
the starting xi against @entity24 could well be the team against @entity66
