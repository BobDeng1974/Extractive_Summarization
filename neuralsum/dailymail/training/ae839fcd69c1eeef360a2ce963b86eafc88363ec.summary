a @entity1 traveller received a nasty surprise when he was hit with a sky - high $ 1,200 bill after using on - board wifi on a @entity8 flight			1

he said he racked up $ 1,200 in charges with just 155 page views , mostly to his email , and a file upload			1
‘ i wish i could blame an addiction to @entity33 or some intellectual documentary that made me $ 1,200 smarter			0
‘ however , the @entity8 internet was painfully slow , so videos would be impossible and that means i did n’t get any smarter … except about how to charge a lot of money for stuff			2
’ @entity1 businessman @entity9 is accusing @entity8 of gouging its wifi users mr @entity9 spent an hour uploading a four - megabyte @entity46 document			1
he said : ‘ that doc probably cost me $ 100 to upload , so i hope my team liked it			0
‘ i actually even emailed them a warning that my upload was taking a while			0
that email probably cost me $ 10			0
‘ and yes , the pricing per ( megabyte ) was disclosed on sign - up , but i bought the $ 30 package , slept through most the flight , and really did n't think i 'd end up a thousand bucks past the limit			0
’ @entity8 said its wifi price plans may be volume based or time - based , depending on the provider on its website , @entity8 said it offers wifi with different price plans on its @entity66 and @entity69 777 - @entity68 aircraft			1

mr @entity9 wrote on his blog : ‘ i can think of a lot of other things i 'd rather spend $ 1,200 on , like a flight … to @entity90 ! ‘ but alas , i 've already done that and the flight ended up costing way more than expected			2
