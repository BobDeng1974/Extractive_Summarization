by @entity0 why do some people relish the opportunity to solve maths problems , but others get anxious at the mere mention of numbers and letters ? the answer could be genetic , according to researchers			1
a study from @entity11 found that genes can cause a greater ' maths anxiety ' in children who were already struggling in the subject			1
the cause of maths anxiety in children could partially be due to their genes , researchers claim ( stock image shown )			1
the study by @entity11 found a genetic predisposition could exacerbate or reduce the risk of doing poorly in maths , meaning children who were already struggling would do even worse to examine this theory , researchers examined how twins differ on measures of maths anxiety			1
it provides a revised view on why some children may develop a fear of maths that makes it more difficult for them to solve problems and succeed in school			1
in the battle of the sexes , boys have always been thought to perform better in subjects like maths and science			0
but a review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long - held stereotype			0
the study , which looked at data from 1914 to 2011 , suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years			1
the research also claims that girls do better at all ages , in all subjects and all over the world			0
according to the data , compiled by the @entity56 in @entity57 , girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers , from infant school to secondary school			0
the differences are the biggest in language and the smallest in maths , but even in these subjects girls get better grades on average , the researchers said			2
but although a genetic predisposition was important , it only accounted for about 40 per cent of the problem			2
much of the rest was explained by the different environments in the school , in the home and in social circles			0
‘ genetic factors may exacerbate or reduce the risk of doing poorly at maths , ' said the study 's principal investigator , professor @entity81			1
‘ if you have these genetic risk factors for maths anxiety and then you have negative experiences in maths classes , it may make learning that much harder			2
' it is something we need to account for when we ’re considering interventions for those who need help in maths			0
’ the study included 216 identical twins and 298 same - sex fraternal twins who participated in the @entity99 and @entity100 , an ongoing long - term study of twins in @entity103			2
children entered the project in kindergarten or first grade , and were assessed during a maximum of eight home visits			0
this latest study included data from the last two home visits , when the twins were between about nine and 15 years old			2
all of the twins completed assessments of maths anxiety , general anxiety , maths problem solving and reading comprehension			1
in the study , over 500 twins completed assessments of maths anxiety and general anxiety , with the results suggesting genes played a significant factor			1
the researchers point out that maths anxiety is unique ( stock image shown ) , as children do not get the same anxiety from other subjects such as learning to read the researchers used statistical tools to see how these various measures of anxiety , maths and reading ability were related between fraternal twins and between identical twins			1
this allowed them to make conclusions about how differences in maths anxiety could be explained by genetic factors , and how much could be explained by differences in the environments the twins encountered elsewhere			1
writing in the @entity148 , professor @entity81 added : ‘ it is important to study anxiety as it applies to how well children learn maths			2
‘ you say the word " maths " and some people actually cringe			0
it is not like learning how to read , in which people do n’t normally have any general anxiety unless they have some kind of difficulty			0
‘ @entity164 anxiety is related to both the cognitive side and the affective side of general anxiety			0
‘ this may result in a downward spiraling process in which these genetic risks to anxiety and poor maths performance work with environmental influences to lead to maths anxiety			1
this may leads to further problems in maths performance , which exacerbates the maths anxiety symptoms			0
‘ if we can get a better idea of what provokes this anxiety response , we may be able to develop a better intervention for those with math anxiety			0
‘ before this study , researchers did n’t have a clear idea of how important the genetic component of math anxiety is in children and how it originates			2
' is it because of a lack of actual math skills , such as problem solving and ability to do calculations , or is it related to a person ’s predisposition to anxiety ? ’			0

researchers at @entity11 say a fear of maths could be genetic
in their study of over 500 twins they found genes were a significant factor
other *variables* , such as the environment at school also played a part
findings suggests genes exacerbate the problem of poor maths skills
this can create a ' downwards spiraling process ' , said the researchers
