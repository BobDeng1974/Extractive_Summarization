a @entity1 man holidaying in @entity2 reportedly survived on a diet of flying fox and small native birds after bunking down with locals in the aftermath of @entity8			1
three days before the category five cyclone hit 45 – year - old @entity11 travelled south to @entity12 in the hopes he could climb the active @entity15 volcano			2
the thrill seeker got more than he bargained for as the powerful cyclone hit in the early hours of the morning killing 16 people across the nation and demolishing almost everything in its path			0
he sat huddled with the villagers for four or five hours while the cyclone tore through , destroying the grass huts that made up the village			0
he told @entity39 the wind was incredibly loud , almost like a ‘ freight train or jet plane			0
’ mr @entity11 waited for aid with around 60 villagers at the foot of @entity15 volcano after @entity8 hit after the winds stopped mr @entity11 soon realised he was stranded and spent the next five days cut off from civilisation at the foot of the volcano			1
it was at this stage the villagers discovered that all the gardens and cooking houses were destroyed by the sheer force of the winds			0
he said they managed to find some rice vegetables and chicken which sustained them for a day or two before he was gobsmacked by what he was served next			0
after running out of food villagers offered mr @entity11 flying fox which he said was nice , but tough mr @entity11 was in the southern region of @entity2 when @entity8 hit he was presented with a cooked flying fox but knowing food was limited mr @entity11 said he was in no position to turn his nose up to warm meat he said the resourceful villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting birds and bats			1
“ any time anything flew past , whether it was a finch or a flying fox , there ’d be this hail of sticks thrown at it , ” he told reporters			2
“ they were getting finches and baby pigeons and eating them			0
and one morning they got a flying fox , which is quite large , and they cooked it up with rice and gave me a serve and they ate the rest			1
villagers fashioned missiles from lengths of wood to strike down unsuspecting small birds and bats he did n’t complain about his interesting diet and said it was ‘ quite tasty ’ but tough , likening the flavours to that of chicken			2
although he was happy not to be starving he said he had concerns about the villagers health and safety after the cyclone left them with nothing			0
“ there are lots of young babies in the area and they were saying , ‘ our babies are going to die and the old people are going to die ’ , because it ’s so remote and they ’re at the end of the road so they ’re going to be the last to get aid , probably , ” he said			0
he reported that villagers were having to hike 4 kilometers up mountains to get fresh water			0
mr @entity11 said villagers were concerned about the large population of young children on the island mr @entity11 is worried the villagers will have trouble bouncing back from the disaster , adding that he hopes aid reaches the ‘ far - flung villages ’ like the one that sheltered him			1
although no one he was with sustained injuries , people in nearby villages were n’t so lucky with a mother and son perishing after they were struck with debris			0
mr @entity11 said he intended to return to @entity2 in the ­ future to thank the villagers who sheltered and fed him			1
these revelations came as foreign minister @entity141 pledged @entity143 ’s long term support for @entity2 during a visit to the @entity146 nation			1
' the @entity1 government and the @entity1 people will continue to support you in your time of need ' accompanied by the @entity152 , air chief marshal @entity153 , she strongly indicated that @entity143 would make a substantial contribution to the longer term rebuilding of the devastated nation			2
" prime minister i want to assure you that the @entity1 government and the @entity1 people will continue to support you in your time of need , not only in the immediate aftermath of the cyclone , but i know that your long term recovery efforts will take some time			2
