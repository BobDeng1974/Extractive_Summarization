by @entity0 published : 20:07 est , 24 august 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 24 august 2013 growing numbers of motorists are installing video cameras in their cars to protect themselves against being wrongly blamed for crashes – and to shop other drivers to police			1
so - called ‘ dashcams ’ record the view from the windscreen and are already used in police vehicles and lorries			0
popular in other countries , the gadgets , which can cost up to £ 300 , are starting to be used by @entity16 drivers in the hope of proving they were not at fault in the event of a collision			1
clips from the cameras are being passed to police to help convict dangerous drivers and ‘ crash - for - cash ’ fraudsters , while some people upload dramatic near misses to @entity39			1
some of the dashcams on the market are just a couple of inches long and can be powered by batteries or car lighter sockets			0
they record high - quality digital footage of the road ahead , even at night , and important clips can be saved on to memory cards before being transferred to computers			1
@entity52 , an insurance specialist at the @entity54 , said dashcams provided ‘ excellent protection ’ against crash - for - cash scams			1
he added : ‘ they can be very helpful in the event of an accident to work out who was involved and who was to blame			0
footage could be useful to support an insurance claim			1
the insurance industry would consider them to be a good thing			0
’ mr @entity52 said they could also be used by drivers to show they were not lane - hogging or tailgating , offences that recently became punishable by a £ 100 fine and three penalty points			1
but he added : ‘ we would not be very happy if people were using them for vigilante purposes			0
’ insurer @entity76 has for the past year offered discounts of up to 15 per cent to drivers who have dashcams fitted			2
the company believes the devices encourage safer driving as well as establishing fault in accidents and protecting against scams , particularly when fraudsters deliberately brake in order to cause an innocent motorist to collide with their car , or invent extra passengers who were supposedly injured in a crash			0
general manager @entity95 said : ‘ using an in - car camera can provide valuable evidence to insurers			2
’ earlier this year video evidence from a lorry ’s dashcam was used to help convict a gang who deliberately drove into the vehicle in an attempt to make a fraudulent insurance claim			0
in a separate case , a motorist was disqualified for 12 months because of footage taken on a dashcam that showed him attempting a dangerous overtaking manoeuvre			2
the film was supplied by a member of the public to @entity116 , a firm set up by a former police chief and a businessman which advises clients how to persuade police to view videos of bad driving and also how to secure better insurance deals			0
its records show that several motorists have been given penalty points and fines after footage of their bad driving was sent to police			2
chairman @entity133 said : ‘ there are literally tens of thousands of people now recording their journeys in @entity16			1

drivers upload footage to @entity39 to help catch thieves
