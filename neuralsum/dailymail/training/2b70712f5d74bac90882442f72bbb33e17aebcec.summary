friends reveal that @entity1 was discharged from the @entity2 on account of a failed psychological exam two years before he enlisted in the @entity5 and shipped off to @entity6			1
@entity1 sent a box containing his laptop and personal journals to a friend in @entity11 shortly before he walked off the @entity5 base in @entity6 in 2009 and she has shared the concerning writings with the @entity15			1
some of the more bizarre excerpts feature his rantings about the wisdom of the protagonist in @entity21 's novel @entity20 , his desire to learn @entity23 and ' @entity24 ' and how he wanted to write a story about someone ' going - crazy - to wander the earth alone '			0
' i ’m worried ... the closer i get to ship day , the calmer the voices are			1
my feelings are being flushed with the frozen logic and the training , all the unfeeling cold judgment of the darkness , ' he wrote in one entry shortly before his deployment			1
release : @entity1 was exchanged for five detained @entity41 leaders and now a friend has revealed that he failed a psychological examination in 2006 , two years before he enlisted in the @entity5 frequent misspellings and repeated references to voices inside his head are seen throughout the entries in a notebook and in various files on his computer			1
' these thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind ... i ’ve spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all i had in front of me , that it would be blackness to the very last instent [ sic ]			0
i know this is not right			0
i know that there is light in this darkness , and that i can actuly [ sic ] reach it if i keep walking , keep moving to it			2
' ' like i ’m pulling away from the human world , but getting closer to people ... almost as if its not the people i hate , but society ’s ideas and reality that hold them , ' he wrote in a document called ' threw the mind '			2
' i want to change so much and all the time , but then my mind just locks down , as if there was some one else in my mind shutting the door in my face ... i want to pull my mind out and drop kick it into a deep gorge			0
' @entity1 , who was promoted to @entity84 during his five years in captivity , reportedly had a little - known history with the uniformed services before he enlisted			1
friends were shocked when the introspective teen , who took ballet and fencing lessons near his home in @entity11 , told them that he wanted to join the @entity2			2
uncharacteristic : @entity1 's friend from home in @entity11 said that he does not look like his normal self in footage of the exchange he was close with @entity99 , who ran the center where he took the recreational classes , and she was the one who drove him to take the @entity2 exam even though she had initially told him about her reservations about the idea			1
she was the one who @entity1 later listed as his emergency contact in the @entity5 who he designated should be sent his remains if he was killed in combat			1

' - @entity1 , written in a journal he sent to a friend shortly before walking off an @entity5 base in @entity6 she was also the one who he sent his box filled with his writings , as well as a copy of the libertarian favorite @entity20 and a pile of military records , which she has since shared with the @entity15			1
ms @entity99 , who spoke using her maiden name to avoid threats , said that she shared the information because she was concerned about the portrayal of @entity1 as a cold , calculated deserter as opposed to how she viewed him : as a vulnerable young man with emotional issues			1
his writings , which poetic longings to see the world and become a story teller to unexplainable repetitions of bizarre phrases , give the clearest picture to date of his mental state but the revelation of his history in the @entity2 shows that there were external warning signs that were overlooked by the government			2
the @entity15 checked @entity2 records which show that @entity1 left as a result of an ' uncharacterized discharge ' following just 26 days of basic training			1
@entity1 reportedly told ms @entity99 and other friends that he had faked the exam but they did not believe him			1
' he said he started to feign a psychological disorder , saying strange things to get out			0
i remember flat out calling him out on it — i said " there is something else going on			0
" he said , " i chose to do it , " ' an unidentified friend told @entity168			2
he announced that he had enlisted in the @entity5 two years later			1
normally the @entity5 requires a waiver to be filed noting that they have approved the enrollment of individuals who have previously been discharged			2
one unidentified military official claimed that the @entity5 was aware that @entity1 had received an ' administrative discharge ' in the past when he enlisted			1
inner thoughts : @entity1 sent a box filled with his @entity178 computer , journal , military files and copy of an @entity21 book to a friend in @entity11 and it arrived to her just days after he walked off the base the @entity5 could not immediately confirm or deny the issuance of a waiver			1
he wrote about his feelings both before he left his @entity5 training program in @entity189 and while he was on the base in eastern @entity6			1
' really , how pathetic i feel as i listen to people talk of the hell i will be heading to , ' he wrote in a document saved on his computer under the file name ' my army memories '			0
' compared to hell of the real wars of the past , we are nothing but camping boy scots			0
hiding from children behind our heavy armored trucks and our c - wire and sand bagged operating post , we tell our selves that we are not cowards			0
' one of his last known communications came a few weeks before he left the base on june 30 , 2009			0
he emailed @entity99 's daughter @entity213 , who he had been close with , and told her not to worry if her mother ' gets a call from red cross ' at any time in the future			2
' you know what i do , and ash i am still perfecting , actions may become			0
but plans have begun to form , no time line yet			0
love you ! @entity1 , ' he wrote			2
@entity213 was concerned and emailed back asking about the plans , and he replied in code : ' l1nes n0 t g00 @entity230 tell u when 1 ha ve a si coure 1ine about pl / - \ ns '			0
' there is still time yet for thinking , ' he wrote the next day			2
when she wrote back telling him not to ' do anything stupid or pointless , ' he said ' you know i plan better then that ' .			0

close friend of @entity1 has shared the journals and writings on his laptop that he sent to her shortly before walking off the @entity5 base
' the closer i get to ship day , the voices are , ' he wrote in one entry shortly before being sent to @entity6
she was the one who drove him to take the @entity2 test in 2006 and he told her he ' *purposefully* flunked ' the psychological exam
she did *n't* believe him and thought he had emotional issues
he enlisted in the @entity5 two years later and officials *allegedly* knew that he had a prior ' administrative discharge '
