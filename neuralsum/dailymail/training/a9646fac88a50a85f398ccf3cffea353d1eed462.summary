facebook users in the @entity1 will soon be able to see which of their friends are nearby using a new feature that the company launched on thursday			1
the @entity8 feature must be turned on by the user , so people should n't expect to broadcast their location unknowingly			1
it will use your smartphone 's gps system to tell your @entity17 friends you are nearby - provided they have the feature turned on as well			1
rather than share your exact location , it will show only that you are nearby , say , within half a mile			1
the @entity8 feature uses your smartphone 's gps system to tell your @entity17 friends you are nearby - provided that you both have the new feature turned on if you like , you can manually share a more precise location with a specific friend you 'd like to meet up with			1
friends can see where you 're located in a particular park , airport or city block			0
by default , your exact location will be shared for only an hour , although you can change this			2
nearby friends launches amid the growing popularity of location - based mobile dating apps such as @entity35 and @entity36			1
but unlike those apps , @entity17 's feature will let you meet up only with people who are already your friends			1
@entity17 , whose motto has long been ‘ move fast and break things , ’ built a lot of precautions in this new tool as it tries to avoid privacy fiascos that often bubble up when it makes changes to its service			0
the new motto , ‘ ship love , ’ is evident in the cautious rollout of @entity8 , said @entity54 , director of the @entity55 , an industry - backed think tank in @entity57			0
he has advised @entity17 on privacy issues , including the latest feature			0
unless you manually share your location , as shown here , @entity8 will only show @entity17 friends that you are in close proximity , say within half a mile he believes @entity17 is showing ‘ a deeper appreciation that with a billion users , any change needs to be implemented in a way that does n't surprise the audience			1
’ that 's especially so when it comes to privacy , especially when it comes to location sharing			0
‘ once you start bringing this to a mass audience , you need to be cautious , ’ @entity54 said , ‘ so inadvertent oversharing is not possible			0
’ nearby friends also wo n't be available to users under 18 , said @entity79 , a product manager at @entity17			1
he said the tool ‘ makes it easy to join your friends in the real world			0
’ of course , all the safeguards and slow rollout mean that most users wo n't have the feature available right away on thursday but rather in the coming weeks and months			1
initially it will go to people who are likely to appreciate it , @entity79 said , such as people who have ‘ checked in ’ to various restaurants , bars or other locations using @entity17			0
rather than share your exact location , though , @entity8 will only show friends that you are in close proximity , say within half a mile unlike with other features , @entity17 is n't forcing people to use @entity8			1
therefore , there is a possibility it wo n't catch on widely			2
@entity79 is optimistic that it will			0
@entity79 joined @entity17 in 2012 , when the company acquired @entity105 , his startup service for meeting nearby people who have friends and interests in common			2
he has been working on the new feature since then			0
facebook employees have been testing @entity8 , and @entity79 cites ways it has helped people get together : nearby friends , @entity79 said , is n't for the five to 10 close friends whom you feel comfortable texting or calling up to hang out			1
rather , he said , it 's for the broader group of friends you enjoy spending time with but would n't necessarily call			2
nearby friends may provide that extra push			2
users can limit whom they share their location with to smaller groups of friends			2
users who sign up will be shown a short tutorial on how the feature works			0
besides seeing friends who are nearby , users can also see which of their friends are traveling , and in general which friends are using the feature even if they are not nearby			2
@entity17 says there are no current plans to draw advertising revenue from @entity8			0
the company says it does not currently target ads to users based on where they happen to be at the moment , but uses their stated ‘ current city ’ and the location of their computer based on its numeric internet protocol address .			0

when two people landed at the airport at the same time from different *flights* , they saw that they did through @entity8 and shared a ride home together .
when two people were out shopping alone in @entity183 , they joined forces after seeing each other nearby .
