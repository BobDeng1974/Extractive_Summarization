the 19 - year - old stuntman has become an internet sensation in @entity104 after posting his videos online and hopes that his stunning acrobatic feats will come to the attention of the rest of @entity111			0
the teenager started practicising parkour after watching films of other daredevils on the internet and started training in a playground and in the school gym just a year ago			0
hanging around : @entity104 daredevil @entity102 has become an internet sensation since then he decided to up his game and take advantage of some of his hometown @entity125 's impressive architecture and began doing handstands on bridges over the @entity128 jumping between rooftops and scaling walls			0
he has since amassed an army of fans after posting his videos on @entity133			0
known as the @entity134 , he has said in the past that instead of fearing death , he prefers to imagine that he is safely on the ground while performing stunts			0
naturally , his worried family disapprove of his rather dangerous hobby .			0
