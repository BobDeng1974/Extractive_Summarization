legalising assisted suicide is a slippery slope toward widespread killing of the sick , mps and peers were told yesterday			1
a former euthanasia supporter warned of a surge in deaths if @entity8 allowed doctors to give deadly drugs to their patients			1
‘ do n’t do it @entity17 , ’ said @entity12 , a veteran @entity14 watchdog in assisted suicide cases			1
‘ once the genie is out of the bottle , it is not likely ever to go back in again			0
professor @entity12 ’s intervention comes as peers prepare to debate the @entity32 , promoted by @entity33 , a @entity34 former lord chancellor			1
the bill , which has its second reading next week , would allow doctors to prescribe poison to terminally ill and mentally alert people who wish to kill themselves			0
professor @entity12 , who is an academic in the field of ethics , had argued seven years ago that a ‘ good euthanasia law ’ would produce relatively low numbers of deaths			1
peers are preparing to debate the @entity32 which was promoted by @entity33 , a @entity34 former lord chancellor but , speaking in a personal capacity yesterday , he said he now believed that the very existence of a euthanasia law turns assisted suicide from a last resort into a normal procedure			1
a ‘ slippery slope ’ for assisted dying in @entity17 would mean that euthanasia would follow the same path as abortion , which was legalised in 1967			1
there are now nearly 200,000 terminations a year			0
anti-euthanasia campaigners and disability activists called on politicians to listen to the professor ’s warning			0
the paralympian , @entity63 , said : ‘ what dr @entity12 says comes as no surprise			1
‘ an assisted dying law is playing with fire , especially when there are no safeguards in place			2
@entity33 ’s bill just is n’t fit for purpose			1
’ baroness @entity74 , who is a disability rights campaigner , said : ‘ as happens in @entity23 , @entity33 ’s bill could end up encompassing significant numbers of seriously ill people			1
’ euthanasia is now becoming so prevalent in the @entity23 , professor @entity12 said , that it is ‘ on the way to becoming a default mode of dying for cancer patients ’			1
he said assisted deaths have increased by about 15 per cent every year since 2008 and the number could hit a record 6,000 this year			1
he said he was concerned at the extension of killing to new classes of people , including the demented and the depressed , and the establishment of mobile death units of ‘ travelling euthanasing doctors ’			0
activists , professor @entity12 said , continue to campaign for doctor - administered death to be made ever easier and ‘ will not rest ’ until a lethal pill is made available to anyone over 70 who wishes to die			1
‘ some slopes truly are slippery , ’ he added			0
the @entity98 academic has been a member since 2005 of a review committee charged with monitoring euthanasia deaths			1
its role includes a duty to ‘ tell doctors how their actions in particular cases are likely to stand up to legal , medical and ethical scrutiny ’			2
professor @entity12 admitted he was ‘ wrong – terribly wrong , in fact ’ to have believed regulated euthanasia would work			1
‘ i used to be a supporter of the @entity23 law			1
but now , with 12 years of experience , i take a very different view			2
@entity12 ( left ) warned of a surge in deaths which @entity63 ( right ) said came as no surprise ‘ whereas in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric illnesses or dementia appear in reports , these numbers are now sharply on the rise			1
‘ cases have been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged , lonely or bereaved			1
‘ some of these patients could have lived for years or decades			2
pressure on doctors to conform to patients ’ – or in some cases relatives ’ – wishes can be intense			0
‘ pressure from relatives , in combination with a patient ’s concern for their wellbeing , is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia request			2
not even the review committees , despite hard and conscientious work , have been able to halt these developments			0
’ the latest euthanasia figures for the @entity23 show that nearly one in seven deaths are at the hands of doctors			1
@entity153 is @entity155 - based organisation which helps people to kill themselves			0
candidates have to fill in an official form to prove they want to commit suicide in 2012 , there were 4,188 deaths by direct euthanasia – 3 per cent of all deaths – and 3,695 deaths by direct euthanasia in 2011			1
the figures do not include deaths by terminal sedation , where patients are rendered unconscious before they are dehydrated and starved to death , an act often referred to as ‘ euthanasia by omission ’			1
this practice accounts for more than 12 per cent of all deaths in the country			2
the @entity23 is following a pattern that anti-euthanasia campaigners say has happened wherever the practice has been legalised			1
doctors in neighbouring @entity181 are collectively killing an average of five people every day by euthanasia – with a 27 per cent surge in one year			2
dignity in @entity187 , the pressure group which supports @entity33 ’s bill , dismissed fears that the legislation might lead to similar horrors			1
its spokesman @entity193 said : ‘ @entity33 ’s @entity32 will not legalise euthanasia , rather assisted dying for adults who are terminally ill and mentally competent , similar to legislation in @entity198 which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness			1
’ anti-euthanasia campaigners dispute that the @entity198 law is safe or that limited numbers are dying at their own request			2
@entity204 , honorary secretary of @entity205 , the anti-euthanasia pressure group , said legalising assisted suicide would be like ‘ stepping off a precipice ’			1
‘ it means that you would lose the right to live , ’ she said			0
‘ it is more serious than people realise			0
’ under @entity33 ’s bill , a terminally - ill patient would be able to ask for drugs to kill him or herself			1
two doctors would need to approve , and to be satisfied the patient was of sound mind and settled view , and had not been influenced by others			0
in 2001 the @entity23 was the first country in the world to legalise euthanasia and , along with it , assisted suicide			1
various ‘ safeguards ’ were put in place to show who should qualify and doctors acting in accordance with these ‘ safeguards ’ would not be prosecuted			0
because each case is unique , five regional review committees were installed to assess every case and to decide whether it complied with the law			0
for five years after the law became effective , such physician - induced deaths remained level - and even fell in some years			2
in 2007 i wrote that ‘ there does n’t need to be a slippery slope when it comes to euthanasia			2
a good euthanasia law , in combination with the euthanasia review procedure , provides the warrants for a stable and relatively low number of euthanasia			2
’ most of my colleagues drew the same conclusion			0
but we were wrong - terribly wrong , in fact			0
in hindsight , the stabilisation in the numbers was just a temporary pause			2
beginning in 2008 , the numbers of these deaths show an increase of 15 % annually , year after year			2
the annual report of the committees for 2012 recorded 4,188 cases ( compared with 1,882 in 2002 )			2
2013 saw a continuation of this trend and i expect the 6,000 line to be crossed this year or the next			0
euthanasia is on the way to become a ‘ default ’ mode of dying for cancer patients			2
alongside this escalation other developments have taken place			0
under the name ‘ @entity279 , ’ the @entity278 founded a network of travelling euthanizing doctors			0
whereas the law presupposes ( but does not require ) an established doctor - patient relationship , in which death might be the end of a period of treatment and interaction , doctors of the @entity279 have only two options : administer life - ending drugs or send the patient away			0
on average , these physicians see a patient three times before administering drugs to end their life			0
hundreds of cases were conducted by the @entity279			0
the @entity300 shows no signs of being satisfied even with these developments			0
they will not rest until a lethal pill is made available to anyone over 70 years who wishes to die			2
some slopes truly are slippery			0
other developments include a shift in the type of patients who receive these ‘ treatments ’			0
whereas in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric illnesses or dementia appear in reports , these numbers are now sharply on the rise			1
cases have been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged , lonely or bereaved			1
some of these patients could have lived for years or decades			0
whereas the law sees assisted suicide and euthanasia as an exception , public opinion is shifting towards considering them rights , with corresponding duties on doctors to act			1
a law that is now in the making obliges doctors who refuse to administer euthanasia to refer their patients to a ‘ willing ’ colleague			0
pressure on doctors to conform to patients ’ ( or in some cases relatives ’ ) wishes can be intense			0
pressure from relatives , in combination with a patient ’s concern for their wellbeing , is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia request			0
not even the @entity354 , despite hard and conscientious work , have been able to halt these developments			0
i used to be a supporter of the @entity23 law			2
but now , with twelve years of experience , i take a very different view			0
at the very least , wait for an honest and intellectually satisfying analysis of the reasons behind the explosive increase in the numbers			0
is it because the law should have had better safeguards ? or is it because the mere existence of such a law is an invitation to see assisted suicide and euthanasia as a normality instead of a last resort ? before those questions are answered , do n’t go there			1
once the genie is out of the bottle , it is not likely to ever go back in @entity382 has been a member of a @entity384 since 2005			0
for the @entity23 government , five such committees assess whether a euthanasia case was conducted in accordance with the law			1
in the past nine years , prof. @entity12 has reviewed almost 4,000 euthanasia cases			1
the views expressed here represent his views as a professional ethicist , not of any institution .			0

@entity12 , a @entity14 assisted suicide watchdog , said ' do *n't* do it '
in @entity23 euthanasia has been legal since 2002
however , in six years the numbers of deaths have doubled
