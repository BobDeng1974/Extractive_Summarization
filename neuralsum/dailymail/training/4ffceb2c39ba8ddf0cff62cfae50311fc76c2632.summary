@entity0 is anticipating a ‘ spectacular challenge ’ for @entity2 from his former club @entity3 on tuesday night			1
the 49 - year - old , who led @entity3 to the @entity6 title in 2012 , gave an insight into where the @entity9 clash at the @entity10 will be won and lost in @entity12 newspaper @entity11			1
@entity0 gives his views on @entity3 's upcoming @entity9 clash with @entity2 who are @entity2 ’s dangermen ? a complete @entity2 can beat @entity3 but the absences of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 make them more vulnerable			1
i have seen @entity22 has been called up to the squad — he can create problems			2
in the counter-attack he can be devastating			2
@entity26 turned 38 at the weekend but is still important because , with the class he has , he knows how to move around the field			2
he runs less , but he makes the ball run			0
@entity26 can still cause @entity3 problems , says @entity0 @entity31 and @entity32 will both play important roles for @entity2 on tuesday night @entity31 scored a spectacular goal at the weekend			1
i remember him at @entity37			0
his technical ability is not under discussion , but he must grow			0
young people often think when success comes on the field that their growth has finished			0
talent must be trained every day			0
@entity32 is a player i have always admired			1
at nearly 35 , he belongs to the category of players who are incomprehensibly undervalued			0
who is @entity3 ’s player to watch ? @entity46			1
the midfielder is a force of nature who @entity3 are seeing the best of			1
then there is the class of @entity59 , the goalscoring instinct of @entity61 and the running of @entity63			0
@entity46 is @entity3 's main man that @entity2 need to be wary of city are a great team			1
they have been strong for several years and each year they manage to improve , buying very good players			0
at home they always express themselves well , they are very solid , they have so much possession and they have unpredictable players			0
the @entity6 title will be between them and @entity78			0
how do you beat @entity3 ? the key is a fast start and to take advantage of the opportunities they offer			1
@entity2 have to be careful in defence , concentrate for 90 minutes and be clinical in attack			1
city practise a different style of football to the others in @entity91 — infinite passes , the ball on the ground , the ability to switch between patterns of attack in the middle or on the wings			2
city are not the @entity101 of a few years ago , all running and competitiveness			0
this could be an advantage for @entity2			2
@entity0 helped @entity3 win the @entity6 title in 2012			2

@entity108 poses biggest *threat* for @entity2 *ahead* of @entity10 clash
@entity32 and @entity31 play important roles for @entity114 side
@entity12 must be careful in defence and clinical in attack to stun @entity3
