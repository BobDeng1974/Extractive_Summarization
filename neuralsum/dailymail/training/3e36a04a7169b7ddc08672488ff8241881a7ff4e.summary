@entity0 is poised to try and reclaim the bet365 @entity1 at @entity2 on saturday			1
the 2012 winner , fourth in the @entity4 to @entity5 , is one of two @entity8 entries alongside @entity9 , not seen since finishing a creditable fifth in last season ’s @entity11			2
@entity0 wound up his campaign with victory in the @entity15 at @entity16 in the spring and is likely to use saturday ’s feature chase as a springboard to the valuable @entity19 at @entity20 next month			1
@entity0 ( r ) won the @entity21 at this year 's @entity22 's @entity11 @entity24 winner @entity25 could be the star attraction in the @entity27 at the same venue			1
the exciting six - year - old , who took his unbeaten record to five with victory in the staying showpiece at the @entity33 , is one of 10 entries and may renew rivalry with @entity36 who was back in third in march			0
more than that has been tipped to perform at the @entity27 in @entity2 @entity39 , pilloried by many for their decision to rebrand the track as @entity43 , has dumped the rather grandiose title			0
the track attracted widespread criticism for the decision of joint managing directors @entity49 and @entity50 to rename the @entity51 course as part of a strategy which also featured the introduction of an ill - informed dress code			0
@entity49 and @entity50 left the racecourse last year and the dress code has since been relaxed , while track officials confirmed yesterday the course would revert to the banner of @entity39 .			0

@entity0 will return to the bet365 feature chase at @entity2
the 2012 winner will use race as springboard for @entity19 at @entity20
@entity24 winner more of that is set to star in @entity27
