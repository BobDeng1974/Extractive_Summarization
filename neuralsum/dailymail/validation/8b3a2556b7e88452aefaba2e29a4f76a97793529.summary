@entity0 had in his hand a piece of paper			2
well , more of a crumpled scrap , to be honest , and it was more a reminder of his ambition and his faith in the future than a declaration of war			0
when @entity0 unfolded his training notes , they included names scribbled in biro for a session at @entity16 and the two circled were @entity18 and @entity19			1
captain @entity18 , with 101 caps and 46 goals , had started the day with a formal presentation of the @entity24 player of the year award for 2014 , as voted for by supporters			1
is this going to be @entity24 's new strike partnership for the @entity29 qualifier against @entity30 on friday ? @entity19 trains with the @entity24 senior squad for the first team at @entity16 on tuesday morning @entity0 holds a piece of paper which seems to pair @entity18 and @entity19 together in attack @entity0 talks with assistant manager @entity36 ( left ) and coach @entity37 during the session @entity19 jogs alongside @entity18 ( 3rd right ) and uncapped @entity41 team - mate @entity40 ( 2nd right ) @entity19 goes through a drill with the ball as training gets underway at @entity24 's @entity46 - upon - @entity48 base @entity19 challenges @entity50 midfielder @entity49 for the ball during tuesday 's session games played : 26 minutes played : 1,876 goals : 19 right foot : 10 left foot : 5 headed : 4 inside area : 17 outside area : 2 @entity19 was the new - boy , uncapped , in his first squad , but with eyes and lenses focused on him in search of clues about whether his @entity41 goal rate could be transplanted to the international stage			1
the 21 - year - old @entity41 striker took his tally for the season to 29 with a hat - trick against @entity70 on saturday and inched a little closer to his @entity24 debut when @entity72 pulled out with an injury			1
@entity0 proved with @entity74 and @entity75 that he can be bold when it comes to selecting young players and his key decisions will revolve around whether to start with @entity19 against @entity30 in a sell - out @entity29 qualifier at @entity81 , on friday			1
@entity82 ( left ) , @entity19 and @entity83 in action during @entity24 's first training session of the week @entity24 manager @entity0 could hand @entity19 his @entity24 debut against @entity30 on friday @entity19 's chances of making his @entity24 debut improved after @entity72 withdrew from the squad @entity19 has scored 29 goals in all competitions for club side @entity41 this term ' his confidence must be sky - high , ' said @entity24 's vice-captain @entity93			1
' to meet up with @entity24 for the first time off the back of a hat - trick , he is in a good place and deserves his place in this squad			1
' for me he 's ready to play , i 'm sure he 'd relish the opportunity , but so are the other guys			2
so that 's down to the manager			0
' it 's always daunting when you 're in the squad for the first time , even if you ' re in fantastic form and i 'm sure @entity19 's no different			1
he 's still a young boy			0
but he needs to carry on doing what he does at club level			0
everyone is aware of him			0
this should be no different			0
i 'm sure he 'll do terrifically well if called upon			0
' at club level , @entity93 has played against him three times this season , winning twice with @entity118 , including the @entity120 final , and losing 5 - 3 at @entity121 on @entity122 , when @entity19 scored twice			1
@entity19 and his @entity24 team - mates listen to instructions during a break in training @entity18 ( centre ) was presented with @entity128 as voted for by fans @entity93 applies pressure to the @entity24 new - boy during training on tuesday morning ' it 's hard to talk a young player up too much because we do that a lot in this country , but for me he has everything , ' said @entity93			1
' he can hold the ball up , he runs in behind , he has two good feet , he can head , he can finish , he has a bit of pace and physically he is strong enough			0
' for me , the attributes a striker needs are all there			0
it 's about how he progresses			0
he comes across as a top professional			0
' the @entity24 players tried to make the transition smooth for @entity19 when he arrived at @entity16 on monday			2
' you introduce yourself and we train together , ' said @entity93			2
@entity72 's thigh injury leaves @entity0 with three recognised strikers			2
@entity18 will start as he closes in on sir @entity154 's @entity24 goal record after two goals in @entity156 , in november , and @entity157 performed well , scoring twice in a 3 - 1 win against @entity159 , three days before			1
if @entity0 sticks with a diamond formation @entity19 will be competing for a starting berth with @entity157 @entity162 is hoping the manager plays with a diamond because it will better suit the midfielder if @entity0 sticks with the diamond midfield formation , which has served him well since he introduced it for the first qualifier in @entity169 , he will have to choose between @entity170 and @entity157 to partner the captain up front			1
this shape suits @entity75 , in behind the strikers , and @entity162 , in front of the centre - halves , with @entity177 and @entity178 providing the mileage on either side			2
@entity178 has been ill and is yet to train with @entity24 this week but he reported to the camp yesterday			0
another option @entity0 will consider , especially if @entity178 is below full power , is a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system with @entity177 deep in tandem with @entity162 and @entity19 up front , ahead of @entity157 , @entity18 and @entity75			1
' we 've played a diamond enough times at @entity190 , ' said @entity162			0
' that 's not to say it 's the only position i can play , but it 's a formation that would probably suit me			0
