' can you have sex for me this weekend ? ' as far as requests from the boss go this has to be up there with the weirdest - or best			2
my mission ? to put @entity9 's new sexercise workout to the test			1
new research shows that the average @entity13 couple has sex for 22 minutes and 48 seconds and so the health - conscious brand has released a 23 - minute track designed to burn calories while you heat up between the bed sheets			1
my editor does n't know this ( i hope ) but i have been on the lookout for some new sexy time soundtracks for a while now			0
it 's not going well			2
scroll down for audio @entity27 tried @entity9 's new sexercise cd in the hope of boosting her fitness between the sheets @entity27 's husband @entity32 , left , ' pressed stop on the stereo ' five minutes into the synth - heavy track i have cringing memories of attempting a drunken striptease to the @entity37 after the @entity38 , and a recent demand for my husband to put on some kinky tunes resulted in him buckling under the pressure and choosing a @entity44 album			1
great for the bedroom if you 're a frisky 90 - year - old i imagine			2
late night radio is often a bit creepy and a @entity50 search for ' sexy ' playlists brings up hundreds of hours of lame r&b that would n't even give @entity53 the horn			0
so maybe this ' music track sex aid ' could be the answer ? i like music , i like sex , and i 'm starting to like exercise so what a brilliant excuse to combine all three in the name of work / investigative reporting ... getting down to @entity65 there 's something terribly teenage about putting on a record then being expected to feel frisky , but after an awkward minute or so we soon remembered why we were in the bedroom			1
after some serious kissing , my new ( decidedly un-sporty ) underwear started to fall off , and it was about five minutes in that the magic happened ... my husband pressed stop on the stereo			2
the problem was not that we felt unsexy trying to get fit , it 's that the music is just plain awful			2
@entity27 said the music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio - as well as fits of laughter to the bedroom it 's 23 minutes of cheap synthesizer sounds that went out of fashion around the same time as porn movies starring dungaree - wearing plumbers			1
most modern women - and men apparently - have some standards in the bedroom , and that applies to the music they 're listening to as well as their chosen partner			2
instead of boosting our sex session , this ' sex aid ' totally killed it and left me thinking that i would have burnt more calories walking to the pub ( and probably had better sex afterwards )			0
does it work as a workout ? determined to see the 23 minutes through to the end ( and not to have to go to spinning the next day ) i gave it another go wearing headphones so that my husband would n't have to perform to ' awful @entity108 lift music '			1
wearing headphones while naked has its own limitations , but we eventually got into the swing of things			0
@entity27 's husband called the track , which was created with the help of fitness experts , ' awful @entity108 lift music '			1
i decided to treat it like a normal workout , focusing on different parts of my body as the track went on , and holding certain positions or counting 20 reps of particular moves , and i did start to feel the burn on thighs , arms and stomach at various points			1
but should n't that happen anyway if you 're trying hard enough ? the music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio , as well as fits of laughter			0
the tricep dips were interesting / eye - opening			0
and while it was n't exactly a @entity145 workout it was enough to get my heart rate going and the morning after i definitely felt a bit of satisfying muscle soreness in my thighs and arms			0
@entity9 says the piece , which is free to download , is designed to sync with ' calorie - burning sex sessions ' the verdict @entity154 ! yes ? er , no. there is nothing sexy about lift music and if you have even a smidgen of musical taste i defy you to get in the mood to this synth - heavy soundtrack			1
any way to squeeze a bit more exercise into the week has to be a good thing			0
and 80 per cent of couples say they would change their sexual routine if it helped them lose weight			0
but i think the answer to this might be just to have more sex , people			0
workouts are called @entity177 for a reason and - even ignoring the naff notes of the track - reminding myself to hold positions or try harder in the name of fitness rather than the heat of the moment meant that sex felt almost like a chore and certainly a lot less intimate			1
trying to keep up with the song 's tempo sometimes interrupted the natural rhythm of things and it 's not very romantic to hear your partner counting reps under their breath			0
throughout the 23 - minute session i kept hearing the @entity200 lyrics ' 23 positions in a one night stand ' in my head , and i ca n't help but think that would be a lot more fun and a much better workout			1
