by @entity0 published : 04:35 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 05:02 est , 25 october 2013 it has been the royal family 's pram of choice for almost a century and for @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , it is no different			1
considered ' the world ’s most exclusive pram ' , a @entity7 has carried the @entity10 , her children , grandchildren and now her three - month - old great - grandchild @entity13			1
the @entity14 are so attached to their one that they had it flown up to @entity19 especially last month			1
invented in 1877 by @entity46 , the baby carriages became hugely popular by the 1960s			2
both the @entity10 and prince @entity28 spent some of their early months in a @entity7 pram			1
television footage of her majesty pushing her children around royal estates in one helped turn them into a ‘ must have ’ baby accessory for the wealthy			2
the prams were often spotted being pushed by @entity59 wearing their distinctive brown uniforms			0
1963 : prince @entity4 's mother @entity40 , later @entity40 , sat in her buggy in the grounds of @entity44 in @entity45 1965 : @entity10 and prince @entity63 with their children , prince @entity28 , @entity66 , prince @entity67 , and @entity68 in his @entity7 @entity6 's ? @entity7 's latest @entity70 pushchair , designed with the help of @entity72 in 1877 inventor @entity46 created @entity7 because of a lack of suitable buggies for his own children			1
he opened a small workshop in @entity78 , @entity79 , where he grew the business with the help of his three sons			0
in 1913 it became the official royal pram , and a special edition was created and sent to @entity25 for princess @entity10 , who is now @entity10			1
after moving to larger premises , an old silk factory in @entity88 , it has grown to a worldwide brand , with more than 10million parents having bought one in more than 50 countries			0
but as smaller and lighter prams and buggies came on the market , the tradition @entity7 model faded in popularity			0
the originals are probably considered a tad cumbersome by most 21st century parents , and many families would struggle to afford one – let alone get it through their front door			0
but @entity4 and @entity5 have stuck with @entity107 tradition and ferry @entity13 around in a @entity7 pram			1
@entity109 declined to reveal which model @entity4 and @entity5 opted for			1
they might have chosen the £ 1,450 @entity113 pram which is described as the ‘ ultimate classic pram ’ by its designers			2
most recently @entity7 has worked with @entity72 to create the @entity70 , a £ 2,000 buggy that will ensure children are being wheeled around in style			2
based on the same design as the rare £ 1.2million one - 77 coupe , it features an @entity124 ultra-soft @entity122 suede interior , leather - trimmed push bar and aluminum alloy wheels			0
the buggy also features air - ride suspension which its makers say will glide over every kind of terrain , and is branded with the @entity72 classic winged logo on the seat and metal work			0
they have created just 800 limited edition @entity138 buggies , available exclusively from @entity139 , saying that the stylish pram is ' designed to perfection with every detail considered ' .			0

set up in 1877 , it produced the first royal pram for the @entity10 in 1927
it has been used by almost all her children , grandchildren and now @entity13
@entity4 and @entity5 so attached they had their son 's flown up to @entity19
