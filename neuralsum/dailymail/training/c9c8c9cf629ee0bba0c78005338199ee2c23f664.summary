brutal : these starlings engaged in a mid-air fight , which included pecking and claws to the eyes this fiercely fought battle between two young starlings has been documented by a bird lover in a series of stunning images with feathers flying , the two birds locked beaks as they started to fight it out over scraps of food on a bird feeder , in @entity18 , @entity19 when twitcher and nature photographer @entity33 put food out for his feathered friends he said he had no idea that it would encourage bird brawls when twitcher and nature photographer @entity33 put food out for his feathered friends he had no idea that it would encourage bird brawls			1
but he was on hand with his camera to capture the starlings as they battled for their share			1
mr @entity33 said he achieved the beautiful pictures of the notoriously vicious birds with a @entity46 , with a 1/5000 second exposure			1
mr @entity33 , from @entity48 , said : ' the fighting included pecking , claws to the eyes , whistles , rattles , and clicks and mid-air attacks where they would lock claws together waiting for the weaker bird to let go first			1
luckily the father of three was on hand with his camera to capture the starlings as they battled for their share mr @entity61 said he set up the feeding station so his children , @entity63 , 11 , @entity65 , seven and @entity66 , three , could learn and share his love of birds , with no idea it would cause such an argument between the young birds with neither bird backing down as they hover over the feeding tray it looks like this fight is far from over the birds are notoriously vicious over their food			1
during angry attacks over feed they use their claws against their opponent and peck each other with their sharp beaks ' other starlings soon joined in and the scene almost looked like a group of drunk men fighting after last orders outside a pub. it got really ugly			2

he said they were certainly getting an education from it			0
he said : ' i set up some feeders to attract local birds to my garden so the kids could enjoy watching and identifying them as they came in and fed. ' after putting out a block of suet insect feed , meal worms and some water the war soon unfolded			2
mr @entity33 said the two birds appeared t be going ' hell for leather ' as they battled it out for the feed ' two of the juvenile @entity116 siblings were going hell for leather to be the dominant bird and get the spoils			1
' after doing some research on the birds i found out that @entity116 can be extremely aggressive particularly over food			0
' they are not always a well liked bird and during breeding season will even fight to the death			0
' my children found them quite amusing as they would stand face to face in a territorial stand - off and then take to the air to finish off the battle			0
' i only hope they learn that it is no way to behave			0
' @entity116 , a @entity135 ‘ red - listed ’ species - meaning it is of the highest conservation concern - hit an all - time low in the @entity138 ’s annual @entity137 survey last year and their numbers sank by a further 16 per cent in gardens this year			0
