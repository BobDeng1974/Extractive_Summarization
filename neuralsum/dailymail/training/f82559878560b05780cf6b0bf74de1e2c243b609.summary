astronomers now say the object more resembles ' man made ' fragments , probably from the @entity13 weather satellite launched on tuesday , rather than a meteor			1
the weather satellite is being used to track cloud cover , storm systems , temperature , humidity , and polar ice movements for the next five years			1
' it looks like it was the upper - stage of a @entity4 's rocket that was launched a few days ago , ' ms @entity46 told @entity57			2
' apparently the tracking and impact prediction matched , time and location , what we saw			2
' she said the object seen over @entity8 skies would have been a piece of the rocket designed to fall away as part of the launch of the satellite			2
' it 's kind of like the @entity73 mission , ' she said			0

' the fact they saw all these colours in it could indicate it 's made of different materials			0
' mr @entity89 also pointed to a @entity108 post by @entity109 winning @entity111 astronomer @entity110			0
' so our fireball may well have been a piece of space junk , ' prof @entity110 wrote , linking to data showing the trajectory of meteor decay			2
@entity120 astronomer @entity119 replied that he had had the same idea			0
' space junk crossed my mind too			0
travelling close to horizontal and taking a long ( time ) to burn up , " he wrote			0
