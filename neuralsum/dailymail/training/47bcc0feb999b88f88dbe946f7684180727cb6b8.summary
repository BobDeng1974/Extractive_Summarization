he was the first @entity1 to win a @entity3 prize in physics after he predicted the existence of the so - called ' @entity7 particle ' , but in his home country @entity9 's achievements have been written from the record books			1
despite being a leading figure in @entity1 's space and nuclear program @entity9 was shunned by @entity16 fundamentalists when they took control of the country in the 1970s			1
although he was a @entity16 , the physicist , who died in 1996 , belonged to the @entity21 , who believed @entity23 was their spiritual leader as opposed to the prophet @entity24			2
ignored : @entity9 was the first @entity1 to win a @entity3 prize in physics after he predicted the existence of the so - called @entity7 particle , but in his home country his achievements have been written from the record books as a result @entity9 along with @entity1 from other religious minorities , such as @entity32 , @entity29 and @entity30 were pushed into the wilderness and attacked by militants from the @entity16 majority			1
today all @entity1 passport applicants must declare on their passport application that they believe the prophet @entity39 was an ' impostor ' and that his followers are ' non-muslims			1
' today @entity21 face prison or even death if they pose as @entity32 , practise their faith publicy , describe their places of worship as mosques or take part in the sacred @entity16 call to prayer			2
breakthrough : the groundbreaking work by professor @entity9 , left , on subatomic particles was proved by the discovery of the higgs - boson particle at the @entity56 in @entity57 , pictured right @entity9 received a string of international prizes and honours for his groundbreaking work in the world of subatomic physics			1
in 1979 , he was joint winner of the @entity3 for his research on the @entity67 of particle physics , which theorized that fundamental forces govern the overall dynamics of the universe			0
@entity9 and @entity72 , with whom he shared the prize , independently anticipated the existence the ' @entity7 particle ' which later became formally known as the @entity76 after the @entity78 professor @entity77 who said the particle was responsible for endowing other particles with mass. @entity82 , a @entity1 physicist who once worked with @entity9 , said the way his colleague had been treated was a tragedy			1
he added : ' he went from someone who was revered in @entity1 , a national celebrity , to someone who could not set foot in @entity1			0
if he came , he would be insulted and could be hurt or even killed			0
' physicists in @entity57 stoked worldwide excitement on wednesday when they announced they have all but proven the @entity76 's existence			0
this was done using the world 's largest atom smasher at the @entity96 , or @entity96 , near @entity97			0
' this would be a great vindication of @entity9 's work and the @entity67 as a whole , ' said @entity102 , chairman of the physics department at @entity104 in @entity105			2

the discovery of the so - called ' @entity7 particle ' proved @entity9 's theory correct atomic level : @entity9 received a string of international prizes and honours for his groundbreaking work in the world of subatomic physics - pictured a ' typical candidate ' event measured in the @entity56 in @entity57 in the 1960s and early 1970s , @entity9 wielded significant influence in @entity1 as the chief scientific adviser to the president , helping to set up the country 's space agency and institute for nuclear science and technology			1
@entity9 also assisted in the early stages of @entity1 's effort to build a nuclear bomb , which it eventually tested in 1998			1
@entity9 's life , along with the fate of the 3 million other @entity21 in @entity1 , drastically changed in 1974 when parliament amended the constitution to declare that members of the sect were not considered @entity32 under @entity1 law			1
@entity9 resigned from his government post in protest and eventually moved to @entity144 to pursue his work			0
in @entity146 , he created a centre for theoretical physics to help physicists from the developing world			0
although @entity1 's then - president , @entity153 , presented @entity9 with @entity1 's highest civilian honour after he won the @entity3 , the general response in the country was muted			1
the physicist was celebrated more enthusiastically by other nations , including @entity1 's archenemy , @entity158			2
despite his achievements , @entity9 's name appears in few textbooks and is rarely mentioned by @entity1 leaders or the media			1
professor @entity77 , 83 , wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced , and later said : ' it 's really an incredible thing that it 's happened in my lifetime			0
' acknowledged : @entity9 and @entity72 , with whom he shared the prize , independently anticipated the existence the ' @entity7 particle '			2
the @entity177 tunnel at the @entity56 is pictured find : physicists in @entity57 stoked worldwide excitement when they announced they have all but proven the @entity76 's existence using the world 's largest atom smasher by contrast , fellow @entity1 physicist @entity183 , who played a key role in developing the country 's nuclear bomb and later confessed to spreading nuclear technology to @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , is considered a national hero			2
the president who honored @entity9 would later go on to intensify persecution of @entity21 , for whom life in @entity1 has grown even more precarious			1
@entity199 militants attacked two mosques packed with @entity21 in @entity201 in 2010 , killing at least 80 people			0
' many @entity21 have received letters from fundamentalists since the 2010 attacks threatening to target them again , and the government is n't doing anything , ' said @entity209 , a spokesman for the @entity210			2
for @entity9 , not even death saved him from being targeted			0
@entity82 said his body was returned to @entity1 in 1996 after he died in @entity213 , @entity214 , and was buried under a gravestone that read ' @entity216			0
' a local magistrate ordered that the word ' @entity16 ' be erased .			0

@entity9 predicted the existence of the higgs - boson particle in 1970s
he was persecuted by @entity224 fundamentalists because for being an @entity21
scientist has been written out of textbooks in @entity1
@entity229 says it is a tragedy that @entity9 is not recognised in home country
on passport applications @entity1 's must declare @entity21 's as non-muslims
