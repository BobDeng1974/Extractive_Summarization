her mother is perhaps one the world ’s most iconic supermodels , with shoots for big names such as @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 under her belt			2
so it ’s hardly surprising that @entity12 ’s doppelganger daughter , @entity11 , is keen to follow in her mother 's glamorous footsteps			1
the 13 - year - old has already lent her good looks to @entity17 and she 's getting set to star in the glossy pages of @entity6 - a major fashion coup for such a fledgling model			1
' she ’s kind of chomping at the bit and the @entity6 piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do			1
' i am very comfortable with the photographer , who is a woman i ’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself			2
' @entity12 , who is one of the world 's most iconic supermodels , has vowed to help her daughter ‘ navigate ’ the fashion industry and keep her grounded			1
she added : ' she ’s still only 13 and too young to know what she wants to do			0
i think even doing this photoshoot , while it was fun , she realises it ’s not only fun - it ’s a job			0
' it ’s not just about sitting there having hair and make - up done and putting pretty dresses on			0
