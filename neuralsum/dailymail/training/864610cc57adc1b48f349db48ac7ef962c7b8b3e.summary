by @entity0 dozens of secret files that could hold vital clues about police corruption in the @entity7 murder inquiry were never disclosed to an investigation into the case , it has emerged			0
a total of 41 boxes of documents – sent to the national archives at @entity14 several years ago – were not examined by the officials behind a damning review published last week			1
@entity17 , whose findings prompted home secretary @entity19 to order a public inquiry into undercover policing methods , became aware of the existence of the boxes only as he was preparing to publish his report this week , and did not have time to look at them			1
on february 14 1997 ( left ) , @entity27 accused @entity7 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity7 of the murder of teenager , @entity7 ( right ) some of the files are so sensitive they carry warnings saying they can not be viewed until the end of the century			0
but they could be unsealed as part of the public inquiry into undercover policing ordered last week by mrs may			1
furthermore , the documents could be even more important because other vital paperwork was shredded by the @entity44 more than a decade ago			1
the @entity46 review found the @entity44 under @entity48 ’ stewardship authorised the ‘ mass - shredding ’ of documents from a four - year inquiry into corruption during the 1990s			1
baroness @entity53 , left , and @entity54 , right , parents of murdered teenager @entity7 @entity57 , sir @entity58 , @entity59 and dr. @entity60 , inquiry team at preliminary hearing of the @entity7 public inquiry , 1997 there were hopes last night the files at @entity14 could contain evidence against former detective sergeant @entity68 over his actions as the murder inquiry began			1
the former officer is suspected of links to the gangland father of one of the @entity7 suspects but the @entity44 has previously denied he was involved			0
however , documents emerged at the weekend showing he tasked junior officers in the key initial stages of the 1993 inquiry			2
mrs may , who has been personally shocked by the revelations , has pledged to bring in a new criminal offence of police corruption			0
senior officers have promised they will get to the bottom of corruption allegations for the first time , after years of denial and botched attempts			0
dr @entity60 , a member of sir @entity92 ’s team who first probed the @entity7 murder in 1999 , warned mr @entity46 about the missed documents			1
he said : ‘ he was unaware of the documents at the @entity96 and said he would not have time to look at them before his report came out			0
i have seen some of the documents at @entity14 and they are very interesting			1
some clearly have very important information in them but restrictions mean they wo n’t be released for 84 years			2
’ it is not clear exactly what restrictions have been put in place on the files , and why			0
dr @entity60 remains convinced that the @entity92 inquiry was hampered from getting to the truth about the killing of the black teenager and is considering calling for an inquiry into the way civil servants handled information relating to the case			2
he added : ‘ now i am almost certain that senior @entity119 civil servants played “ yes , minister ” games with us from the very beginning of the inquiry			0
’ the existence of the forgotten documents emerged as the authorities came under huge pressure to finally take decisive action in the aftermath of the @entity46 report			2
it found officers spied on the @entity7 family , with an undercover officer passing on personal details such as comments on the separation of @entity7 ’s parents			0
home secretary @entity19 ordered a public inquiry into undercover policing methods following the review , but it was revealed that the heavily censored hoard of information was not available to @entity46 's inquiry team			1
now it has been revealed that unexamined evidence could be more important than the shredded evidence officials also raised concerns about the @entity44 ’s record - keeping on its own investigations into police corruption , with key evidence destroyed 11 years ago			2
the focus is now on the potential damage inflicted to the @entity7 murder inquiry by corrupt officers linked to the unsolved murder of private investigator @entity161			0
@entity44 chief sir @entity162 said he ‘ fully supports ’ the public inquiry and said his force must ‘ share everything ’ with it and other investigations .			1

a total of 41 boxes sent to the national archives at @entity14 were not examined
the hoarded information was not available to @entity46 's inquiry
they could be unsealed as part of public inquiry ordered by @entity19
the documents could prove more important than other shredded documents
