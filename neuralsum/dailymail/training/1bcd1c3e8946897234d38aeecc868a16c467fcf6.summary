@entity1 dictator @entity0 said he is open to more talks with his @entity4 counterpart			1
in somewhat of a @entity7 's resolution , the leader said he is open to the discussions or even a summit - a statement welcomed by @entity11 , the capital of @entity4 , which in turn urged the @entity13 to take concrete steps towards normalisation of relations			1
@entity0 's call for improving @entity19 relations in his @entity7 speech comes as @entity21 , @entity1 's capital , faces heightened criticism over its human rights record			2
welcomed : @entity0 's call for improving relations has been welcomed by @entity11 televised : the address was also watched in @entity4			1
this man is pictured watching the speech in @entity30 today condemnation : @entity0 's call for improving @entity19 relations came as @entity21 faces heightened criticism over its human rights record there are also souring ties with @entity38 over allegations it was involved in the massive hacking attack on @entity42 linked to @entity43 , a dark comedy that portrayed an assassination attempt on @entity0			2
@entity1 has denied involvement , but said the hack was a ' righteous deed ' and suggested it might have been carried out by sympathisers or supporters abroad			0
' we believe we can resume suspended senior - level talks and hold other talks on specific issues if @entity4 sincerely has a position that it wants to improve @entity56 relations through a dialogue , ' @entity0 said in the nationally televised address			1
' and there is no reason not to hold the highest - level talks if the atmosphere and conditions are met			1
' meeting such conditions has proven to be virtually impossible in the past			0
the two countries have not held a summit since 2007 and , despite @entity0 's remarks , the likelihood of one happening again soon is very low given the deep distrust that remains between the two countries			1
some experts in the @entity56 , however , cautiously welcomed the possibility of increased talks at lower levels			1
' @entity77 between @entity56 and @entity1 would deepen ... if they fail to improve their political ties and ease military tension through a summit this year , ' said @entity81 from the private think - tank @entity83			1
@entity4 officials say they are open to any form of talks			1
@entity11 is waiting for the @entity87 to respond to its earlier proposal to hold talks this month to discuss a range of issues needed to prepare for the unification and other issues of mutual concern			0
@entity4 made the proposal earlier this week			2
celebrations : @entity1 watch as fireworks explode over the @entity98 in @entity21 to usher in the new year fireworks : @entity1 gather at @entity100 to watch a fireworks display ' if @entity1 truly has a will to improve @entity87 relations through a dialogue , we hope ( the @entity87 ) quickly respond positively to our proposal for talks , ' the @entity4 's @entity102 said in a statement			1
@entity0 noted that this year is particularly significant because it marks the 70th anniversary of @entity4 's liberation from @entity114 colonial rule			1
both sides claim to hold reunification as a fundamental goal , but a vast gap remains over how that should be accomplished and under what form of government a unified @entity4 would be administered			1
on domestic policy , @entity0 indicated he will stick to the country 's longstanding ' @entity123 ' policy and suggested he would pursue science , technology and economic policies aimed at improving the impoverished nation 's standard of living			2
but he also fell back to familiar accusations that the @entity56 and the @entity131 are to blame for tensions on the @entity133			2
@entity0 said @entity4 must abandon all plots to launch wars and try to work toward fostering peace , and that @entity38 must initiate a policy shift by abandoning its ' hostile policy ' and ' reckless invasion plots ' on the @entity87			1
the 30 - minute speech was the third @entity0 has delivered on @entity141 , and the first after the end of the traditional three - year mourning of the death of his father , @entity146 , in late 2011			2
some analysts believe that with the mourning period over , @entity0 will pursue policies that more closely reflect his own personal priorities			2
anger : the @entity43 has angered @entity0 , who is played by @entity152 ( pictured ) in the film a @entity4 activist said he will launch balloons carrying dvds of @entity42 's @entity43 toward @entity1 to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator @entity0			1
the comedy depicting an assassination attempt on @entity0 is at the centre of tension between @entity1 and the @entity131 , with @entity38 blaming @entity21 for crippling hacking attacks on @entity164			0
yesterday , activist @entity165 said he will start dropping 100,000 dvds and usb sticks with the movie by balloon in @entity1 as early as late - january			0
@entity152 , a @entity1 defector , said he 's partnering with the @entity131 - based non-profit @entity170 , which is financing the making of the dvds and memory sticks of the movie with @entity1 subtitles			0
@entity152 said foundation officials plan to visit @entity4 around january 20 to hand over the dvds and @entity178 , and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow			1
' @entity1 's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolisation of leader @entity0 breaks down , ' @entity152 said			2
if carried out , the move is expected to enrage @entity1 , which expressed anger over the movie			0
in october , the country opened fire at giant balloons carrying @entity192 propaganda leaflets floated across the border by @entity4 activists , triggering an exchange of gunfire with @entity4 troops			0
but it is not clear how effective the plan will be , as only a small number of ordinary @entity1 citizens are believed to own computers or dvd players			0
owning a computer requires permission from the government and costs as much as three months ' salary for the average worker , according to @entity4 analysts			0
many @entity1 may not risk watching the movie for fear of being caught			0
not everyone supports sending balloons into the @entity87 , with liberals and border town residents in @entity4 urging the activists to stop			0
@entity1 has long demanded that @entity4 stop the activists , but @entity11 refuses , citing freedom of speech			0
@entity152 said the balloon release will be done clandestinely , with the pace picking up in march when he expects the wind direction to become more favorable			0
calls to the @entity170 on wednesday were not immediately answered			0
the foundation says on its website that it works with @entity1 defectors to use hydrogen balloons to send material across the border , as well as smuggling items through @entity229 and broadcasting radio transmissions to reach those who own illegal short wave radios .			0

the leader said a summit could be held with @entity4
officials in the @entity56 say they are open to any form of talks
@entity0 believes suspended senior - level talks can be resumed
the atmosphere and conditions must be met for discussions to go *ahead*
