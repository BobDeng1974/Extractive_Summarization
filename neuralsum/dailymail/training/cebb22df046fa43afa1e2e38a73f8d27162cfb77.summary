do not destroy the beautiful legacy , that you inherited from the past generations of ' @entity0 '			0
open letter : @entity2 co-owner @entity21 , has asked for a one off game to settle the issue ' i call on you to act according to the spirit of the game and rules of fair play - to issue a joint statement to the @entity14 disciplinary bodies			1
let 's meet in @entity52 or @entity53 and settle this matter honourably			0
' but a @entity0 statement read : ' we are disappointed by @entity2 's comments			2
this is entirely a matter for @entity14 and its processes			0
