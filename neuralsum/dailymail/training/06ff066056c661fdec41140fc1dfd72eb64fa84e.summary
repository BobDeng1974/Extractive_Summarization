class act : @entity5 ( left ) starred in @entity45 's sitcom @entity43 as @entity70 for six years main squeeze : @entity5 may not be married but she and @entity72 studio executive @entity49 are definitely a couple ' @entity0 thinks if @entity14 leaves the show after this season she could be the perfect replacement			1

' she came on the show as a friend of @entity116 's but has n't meshed that well with the others			2
show stopper : @entity6 was a former @entity120 model your 're fired ! @entity92 host also appeared on @entity105 's celebrity apprentice @entity103 where she and @entity107 almost came to blows ' she dresses like a teenage party girl and is n't into fine , southern living , so producers are n't sure that viewers will really connect with her or find her likable			1
' critics of the franchise have complained the lack of @entity133 roots for some of the @entity113 and @entity135 and @entity6 would not be the @entity136 , though married , moved from @entity137 to join the show			1
@entity16 flies in from @entity27 to tape & has no man ; @entity15 was n't married her first 5 seasons ; @entity142 was an unmarried mistress for her first few seasons			0
