the strategic town , which is situated 155 miles north of @entity10 , is now likely to become the base for a future push to take back @entity14 's hometown			1
there was no word on the fate of the refinery , which lies on @entity5 's northern outskirts , today but the advances in the town could help break the five - month siege of the facility by @entity25 fighters			1
@entity1 soldiers battling @entity3 have recaptured most of the town of @entity5 , home to the country 's largest oil refinery which has been under attack by militants for more than five months			1
pictured : smoke rises from the facility since june , a small army unit inside the refinery has successfully resisted wave after wave of extremist assaults			2
lifting the siege of the refinery , which sits inside a sprawling complex , was said to be the next objective in the campaign to rid @entity5 of the militants , according to military officials in the town			1
however , hours after news of the recapturing of @entity5 broke , a suicide bomber rammed his explosives - laden car into a military outpost in the @entity50 district north of @entity10 , killing seven soldiers and wounding 13 others			1
