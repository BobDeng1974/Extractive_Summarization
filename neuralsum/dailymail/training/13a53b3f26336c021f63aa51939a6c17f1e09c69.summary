as we take our virgin steps into space , there is one thing that could always put a cap on our ambitions			0
despite our desire to explore the stars , we are limited by travelling at less than light speed - and even if we managed to match that pace , we would still be listing our voyages from star to star in years , centuries or millenia			2
but , in what could be a huge breakthrough , theorists from @entity16 say there is ' hope ' that we can achieve faster - than - light travel , after physicists found a theoretical possibility for warp speed travel			1
space time mapped out : teams at @entity16 are exploring ways to warp the universe to enable faster than light travel			1
pictured is a model of how a ship , enclosed in a space - time ' doughnut ' , could reach the stars while nothing can break the speed of light , scientists have long considered the fantasy of warp speed travel , where spaceships could bend space and time on itself to move through loopholes in space			1
equations based on the laws of relativity have allowed warp speed in theory : but the energy required to make it happen would require the energy - mass of a @entity51 - sized planet			1
@entity54 physicist @entity53 's theories are the most practical , mooting a ring around a sphere - shaped spaceship , which would contract space in front of the ship , and expand space behind it			0
this would allow faster - than - light travel - if astrophysicists could harness planet - sized energy or sip power from a supernova			1
the 100 year star ship symposium is investigating various means by which we can travel to the stars , hoping to find a happy medium between practical and far - fetched methods but according to @entity73 , @entity74 , from @entity16 's @entity75 , told the @entity76 , a gathering of scientists , writers and philosophers in @entity81 , that new theories could allow man to reach such speeds with less energy			2
he told his audience that , instead of enclosing a space - ship in a space time - bubble , a craft could sit within a ' doughnut ' shape - which means the warp drive could be powered by a mass the size of a spacecraft like the @entity97 - the equivalent size of a small car			0
he told @entity73 : '' the findings i presented today change it from impractical to plausible and worth further investigation			0
' the additional energy reduction realized by oscillating the bubble intensity is an interesting conjecture that we will enjoy looking at in the lab. ' @entity74 and his team are experimenting with a mini-version of a warp drive in their laboratory , using laser to try to warp space and time in miniature			0
he said his ' humble experiment ' was ' trying to see if we can generate a very tiny instance of this in a tabletop experiment , to try to perturb space - time by one part in 10 million			0

@entity16 *suggests* new model which could reduce energy requirements for warp - speed travel from planet - sized to car - sized
' humble experiments ' in laboratory could lead to faster - than - light travel
