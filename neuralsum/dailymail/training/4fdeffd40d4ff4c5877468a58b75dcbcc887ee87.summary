a @entity1 designer has created a range of hand crafted pinhole cameras carved out of chestnut and maple wood and held together using just magnets			1
the @entity9 cameras come in six different dimensions and film sizes ranging from the @entity13 135 format to the 4 " x5 " film holder camera			1
they were created by @entity16 and his brother @entity17 in a design studio just outside @entity19 in @entity1			1
the @entity9 cameras are held together by magnets and come in six different dimensions and film sizes ranging from @entity13 135 format to the 4 " x5 " film holder camera , pictured prices for the @entity9 cameras start at £ 46 for the 135 @entity30 , pictured			1
it is the brainchild of photographer @entity32 who makes the cameras in a design studio in @entity19 , @entity1			1
the project was funded through a @entity37 campaign a pinhole camera is a camera without a lens			1
it has a small hole in one side that acts as an aperture to let in light			2
when you point the camera at an object , light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted image on the film along the opposite side of the box			2
this technique is similar to how eyes see and process images			2
the smaller the hole , the sharper the image , yet the dimmer it will appear			2
a pinhole camera 's shutter is manually operated by a flap of card , for example			2
@entity16 makes all the wooden parts of the cameras himself but some parts , like the pins that rewind the film , and the pinhole require precise @entity74 machining			1
there 's only one screw in the design and the winding pins and backplate are held in place with neodymium magnets that have a pulling force of about 0.5 kg a piece			0
prices start at £ 46 and the project was funded through a @entity37 campaign that raised more than 10 times its target			1
he launched the @entity37 campaign in may and raised more than £ 72,000 - from a target of just £ 6,500			1
@entity16 said : ' in pinhole photography we use small tiny pinhole - sized aperture which we drill with a precision drill , that lets light through to the same material			0
the wooden pinhole camera from @entity98 on the work - bench at the company 's design studio in @entity102 near @entity19 in @entity1			1
founder of @entity98 , @entity16 used crowdsourcing website @entity37 to achieve the funding needed to turn his hobby into a business ' and , because it has such a high aperture , this tiny hole , it produces unique images that no other kind of photographic camera can achieve			1
' ' when you take a picture with a pinhole camera not only the photographer is involved , but also the subject			0
' because exposing images with this kind of cameras takes a little bit longer than just taking a snapshot , so the people that get photographed with these cameras get away with an experience			2
' each of the @entity9 cameras are carved by hand in a workshop by designer halilovic and his brother @entity17			1
@entity16 claims he can make about 100 cameras a week film is loaded inside each model and a single metal screw holds the shutter in place			1
the smallest camera in the @entity9 range is the 135 @entity30 camera that costs £ 46			1
it has a pinhole size of 0.20 mm , a focal length of 25mm , and comes with a standard tripod mount			0
the 135 @entity146 costs £ 60 and shoots @entity13 format in 36mm x 24mm or panoramic double frames at 72mm x 24mm image			0
it also has a 0.20mm pinhole size and 25mm focal length with an added field of view of 113 ° for panoramic shots			0
film is loaded inside each @entity98 camera model and a single metal screw holds the shutter in place			0
the back of each camera is attached using small magnets @entity16 uses a wooden pinhole camera to take photo in @entity102 near @entity19 , in @entity1			1
the cameras , made from walnut and maple , come in six formats and range in price from £ 60 for a 135 format to £ 132 for a slidebox that holds the paper in place @entity175 's 6x6 @entity30 costs £ 73 and uses 120 format film which makes the negatives 56mm x 56mm and has a 115 ° angle of view			1
@entity175 's 6x12 @entity181 camera can take 6x6 , 6x9 , and 6x12 images and costs £ 92			0
@entity16 claims the cameras produce similar looking results as the 135 panoramic but with ' much greater clarity ' , thanks to the 120roll film			2
the camera has a pinhole size of 0.30 mm , a focal length of 40 mm and a standard tripod mount			0
for £ 106 photographers can buy a standard 4 " x 5 " film holder that is secured onto the back of any of the other cameras with magnets			2
@entity16 poses as a wooden pinhole camera is used to take his photo at the @entity9 design and fabrication studio in @entity102 village , @entity19			1
each of the six @entity9 models comes with a standard tripod mount , pictured this picture is the image taken using the @entity9 camera of designer @entity16 in his studio			1

when you point the camera at an object , light from the object travels through the hole and projects an inverted image on the film this camera has a 0.30 mm pinhole , a focal length of 60 mm and a standard tripod mount			0
the most expensive camera in the range costs £ 132 and is made with two sliding boxes that hold the paper in place for the exposure			0
this means an image is produced before the camera film is developed into a darkroom , or before the paper in the changing bag is removed			0
it uses a paper format of 10,5 x 14,8cm , has a 0.3 mm pinhole and a 50 mm focal length			0
@entity246 said : ' nowadays , most of us own a camera and taking a picture has become such an everyday occurrence that we do n't take notice anymore			0
' well , pinhole photography changes that			0
' suddenly , you remember what you were doing on the day you took the picture in detail , who approached you to ask about your camera , how you took the shot , and how you felt when you developed the film - all the things missing in today 's photography			0

the @entity9 cameras are carved out of chestnut and maple wood
@entity1 designer created them using funding from @entity37
more than 100 cameras are *handcrafted* in a workshop each week
