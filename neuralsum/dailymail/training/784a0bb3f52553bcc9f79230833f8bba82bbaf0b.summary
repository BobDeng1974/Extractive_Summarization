by @entity0 published : 22:32 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 03:59 est , 16 august 2013 prof @entity1 has called for a stronger presence of specialists on history programmes she 's the academic who has outed online trolls and faced a barrage of criticism about her looks			1
now classicist @entity1 has a new fight on her hands - the battle to take back control of history programmes to the experts , rather than celebrities			1
prof @entity1 has written an article arguing that television history should be left to the experts who actually know what they 're talking about - rather than well - meaning famous people who read their lines from an autocue			1
she does n't want a complete ban on celebrities fronting such programmes - but does believe that viewers will benefit from people who have dedicated their lives to learning about the subject , rather than someone who knows barely more than the audience			1
in the @entity32 on the @entity34 website , she writes : ' we also need to claim – or keep – a place for specialists themselves , devising , writing and presenting programmes on what they really know about			2
' all the evidence is that viewers appreciate being eyeball to eyeball with the expert			2
' if people turn on a programme about @entity48 ’s policies in the 1930s , they like to know that they are hearing for the person who has worked on that half their lives , not someone reading lines from an autocue			2
' she wrote that while presenters like @entity57 and @entity58 are enthusiastic about the subject , they lack the knowledge to provide a truly enlightening experience for the audience			0
viewers appreciate being eyeball to eyeball with the expert instead of with well meaning celebrities like @entity57 and @entity58 reading from an autocue , prof @entity1 argues her demand for better - informed presenters follows art critic @entity71 's call for experts , rather than celebrities , flooding specialist subject programmes			1
he wrote : ' too much tv is blighted by ever increasing vulgarity and ever lower intellectual levels			0
' the first step of @entity80 programme - makers is to select a popular presenter , a supposedly safe pair of hands , who knows nothing of the subject , but is a friendly face			2
' that friendly face then becomes the subject of the programme — it tells the tale of a journey into slight acquaintance with the subject , but offers no real sound basic knowledge of it			0
' that friendly face will loom from the tv screen , obscuring the subject on which it delivers the drivel prepared for it by so - called researchers			0
' prof @entity1 also used the piece to comment on all those who have focused on her looks , rather than her personality or learning , in reference to her television appearances			1
she explained that it would have been a cowardly decision to avoid television based on the potential criticism she would face from those who would cruelly focus on the fact that she was not as young as many of her female counterparts			0
she wrote : ' i guess that when i agreed to do some tv , i knew that things were n’t necessarily going to be easy for a late middle - aged woman , who looked the 50 something years she was			0
' but it would have seemed cowardly ( and decidedly un-sisterly ) to be frightened off for that reason			0

prof @entity1 says viewers prefer expert 's opinion rather than a celebrity
specialists should present rather than autocue - reading actors
