it has long been seen as a mythical and powerful city , lost for more than 2,000 years beneath the sea			1
explorers have traveled to @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 in search of the the mysterious metropolis of @entity10 - described in detai by @entity12 philosopher @entity11			1
but a computer expert has challenged these theories after he claimed the lost city did not sink at all , and said he had tracked down the site - to an area on land in @entity19			1
the @entity22 computer expert formed his theory using mathematics to calculate the precise gps coordinates of the lost city			1
he meticulously gathered every detail he could from @entity11 's ' @entity41 ' and ' @entity42 ' which describes @entity10 in detail and gives in total 51 clues about the mysterious city			1
these ' clues ' include that @entity10 was near the sea and had a ring - like structure surrounding its centre			2
crucially , it was also said to be 3,100 miles from @entity51			1
this area includes @entity53 , @entity54 and the @entity55			0
other clues were that @entity10 was not in ancient @entity53 or @entity57 and had very high and big mountains , with @entity19 having the @entity60 mountains			1
it was also said to lay west of @entity62 and @entity63			0
using these details @entity29 put the measurements into a computer programme and used a map which divided the area into 400 squares			2
the site pinpointed by @entity29 had many of the 51 clues , including being surrounded by concentric circles @entity29 's theory challenges previous ideas about @entity10 , that it lies somewhere beneath the sea @entity29 marked the areas where more characteristics were present and came out with one region which had the most clues - the @entity82 plain in @entity19 , about 100 miles south of @entity36			1
he then took the gps coordinates and went to have a look himself			0
what he found appeared to have many of the attributes of @entity10 described 2,600 years ago by @entity11 , regarded as one of the greatest @entity89 thinkers			2
this map of @entity10 - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar @entity93 , who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-atlantic before it was lost to the sea the site was in a desert basin just seven miles from the sea and in the centre was a small mound , similar to the raised area at the heart of the ancient city described by @entity11			1
surrounding it were circular dry riverbeds , matching @entity11 's description of the city being surrounded by concentric circles , which alternated between land and sea			1
@entity29 concluded it was highly improbable that all the characteristics of @entity10 were present in this area purely by chance			2
the findings are described in @entity118 ' book the theory is described as ' the most convincing on paper ' by @entity118 in his book , ' meet me in @entity10			0
' @entity118 wrote : ' the measurements for the diameter of his outermost ring and distance of his capital from the @entity128 varied by only about 10 percent from @entity11 's numbers			1
' the author also found support for @entity29 's idea that rather than sinking into the ocean , @entity10 was overwhelmed by a large wave			1
the area around @entity82 is prone to earthquakes , which can cause tsunamis of the size needed to flatten a city			0
@entity29 had claimed that the idea of @entity10 being beneath the sea was simply an example of the real elements of the story being lost over years of retelling			1
also @entity19 has historically not been examined by archaeologists , suggesting many undiscovered remains that may hold the key to the lost city could exist			1
@entity29 formulated his theory in 2008			0
before he died in 2013 he met @entity118 and took him to the precise site he had pinpointed from his calculations			0
the theory differs from many hypotheses that place @entity10 as a lost city beneath the sea , as described by @entity11			1
earlier this year orichalcum , a form of metal , was found beneath the sea off the coast of @entity6 and is believed to have come from the lost metropolis			2
a total of 39 ingots were found in the wreck of a 2,600 year old cargo vessel thought to be from @entity12			0
@entity10 was first described by the @entity12 philosopher @entity11 more than 2,000 years ago			2
while many believe the story is a myth created by @entity11 to illustrate his theories about politics , others insist it is based on a real historical disaster			0
according to @entity11 's account , written around @entity175 , @entity10 was a major sea power located in the @entity128			1
it was larger than ancient @entity178 and @entity179 ( modern @entity180 ) put together , and was ' the way to the other islands , and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent '			0
his account included detailed descriptions of the island - with mountains in the north and along the coast , and a plain in the south			0
its kings were descended from @entity196 - the god of sea - but their divine lineage became diluted as they mixed with mortals			0
by around 9600 bc the island had conquered much of @entity53 and @entity54 and enslaved its enemies			0
this date would make the city nearly as old as the end of the last ice age and pre-dates the earliest recorded city states , found in what is now @entity209 , so seems rather unlikely			0
after a failed attempt to invade @entity51 , the entire island sank into the sea ' in a single day and night of misfortune '			2
over the centuries , scholars have attempted to locate the real @entity10 - believing the account was based on a real ancient superpower			2
one of the most plausible theories is that @entity11 was describing the @entity220 civilisation on @entity4 and the neighbouring island of @entity7 which was devastated by a massive volcanic eruption around @entity223			0
some believe the @entity10 myth was inspired by the @entity227 floods of around 5000bc - an event that may have also generated the flood stories which appeared in the @entity230 .			0

for centuries experts have believed @entity10 is a lost city under the sea
but @entity29 claimed remains of city were actually on land
he said a tsunami had overwhelmed @entity10 , flattening the ancient city
@entity243 had then receded , leaving remnants of city near coast of @entity19
@entity29 used ' clues ' given in @entity11 's description of @entity10 to pinpoint site
identified 51 details and used them to calculate coordinates of @entity10
clues were that @entity10 surrounded by circles and 3,100 miles from @entity51
