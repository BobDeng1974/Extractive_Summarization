he has n't yet appeared on the family 's famous tv show , but prime minister @entity4 is actually a long - lost @entity5 , new research has found			1
the @entity7 leader is the 13th cousin of reality star @entity5 , according the @entity8 , a project that hopes to show how the whole of humanity is distantly related			1
the connection is not quite close enough to see the @entity4 star alongside @entity5 's sisters on @entity15 , but genealogists say that the @entity4 and @entity5 lines do cross on a large enough family tree			1
the pair are just one of a number of unlikely celebrity connections , which also show that the @entity23 is eleventh cousins , four times removed , with socialite @entity26 , and @entity28 leader @entity27 is the 20th cousin of pop star @entity29			2
source : @entity38 @entity39 , @entity29 and @entity40 are just a few of the other celebrities who can now call each other family thanks to project - which now encompasses 77 million people			1
project organiser @entity38 , a @entity46 author who describes himself as ' your cousin ' , is asking people to join his campaign and discover their own famous relatives			1
he told @entity52 : ' i got into the idea after a man contacted me out of the blue after reading one of my books and told me that he had worked out that we were related			0
' i was expecting him to ask me to wire $ 10,000 into his bank account but in fact he told me of a movement of people who are putting together these huge family trees			0
' using genealogy websites that , similarly to @entity66 , are reliant on users ' input , mr @entity38 and his group now aim to build a family tree of the entire human race			1
as well as the @entity73 connection , which links to the 17th @entity75 politician , the 4th @entity74 of @entity76 , sir @entity74 , mr @entity38 has discovered he is ' cousins ' with a number of famous people			0
family : the family tree charts show @entity4 and @entity82 to be 13th cousins @entity23 , right , and @entity85 socialite @entity26 are 11th cousins , four times removed , according to the tree he said : ' i 've contacted a number of people i 've found out i 'm related to , including @entity92 , @entity40 and @entity93			1
' they are often amazed when i tell them all the other people they are connected to			0
@entity92 was pleased to hear he is related to poet @entity98 , who he once played in a movie , and @entity40 was happy when i told him he is related to @entity39 , who is he a big fan of			2
' the validity of some family connections is questionable and mr @entity38 has said he is skeptical of the links when there are more than 50 people involved			0
but he hopes that the project will send out a message that everyone is related to everyone else			0
he said : ' it may sound a bit corny , but i hope for the first time in history we realise we are actually one massive family and perhaps we 'll start treating each other with a bit more respect			0
' a celebration of the @entity8 will be held in june next year on the site of the 1964 @entity122 , now home to the @entity124			0
there will presentations , activities and speeches - and what mr @entity38 hopes will be the largest family photo in history .			2
