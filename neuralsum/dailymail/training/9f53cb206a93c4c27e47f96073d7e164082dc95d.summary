by @entity0 published : 19:48 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 20:17 est , 12 march 2013 return : @entity1 , the former @entity2 singer , has returned from retirement and stepped back into the global spotlight once more see that girl , watch that scene , diggin ’ the dancing queen , wooow - ooo - oo			1
yes , my fellow gnarled pop pickers			2
four decades after she sang about friday nights and the lights being low , an incredible 40 years after she climbed aboard her white platform boots and squeezed into her blue satin knickerbockers , @entity1 is back			1
remember @entity1 ? she was the blonde one in @entity2 , the @entity15 - born fount of a million male fantasies , the dolly bird who made pale blue eyeshadow a thing long before @entity21 even thought about it			1
throughout the @entity23 , @entity1 was the singer we all wanted to be , the platinum - haired pop star with the plaintive edge to her voice , the arch - deployer of curling tongs and unabashed wearer of spray - on satin catsuits			1
throughout that long , long decade that taste forgot , @entity1 never committed the sin of simplicity			1
white lace - up dresses , @entity37 all - in - ones , @entity40 tunics , @entity42 flamenco trousers , capes , chokers and beany hats ? she wore the lot			2
sometimes , it seemed , all at once			2
glittery headbands and jammy layers of lip gloss ? them , too			2
we all thought she was the last word in smoky , @entity15 glam			2
and now the woman who once sang ‘ i ’m nothing special , in fact i ’m a bit of a bore ’ has cast off decades of self - imposed seclusion and stepped into the global spotlight once more			2
so here she goes again , my , my , how can we resist her ? well , can we ? remarkably , the 62 - year - old , long thought of as the @entity64 of pop , has been tempted out of retirement on her estate on the @entity15 island of @entity70			1
she made the decision after hearing a new set of songs written for her by @entity76 , the @entity77 - nominated producer who has previously worked with stars such as @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
whatever he did to @entity1 to winkle her out of her shell , it worked			1
she has a new single out this week , @entity85			2
a new album , her first for nine years , will be released in may			2
simply called a , it includes a duet with @entity89			2
heyday : @entity1 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) when they were performing with the legendary @entity2 can you see where this is going ? some would say straight down the @entity95 on the electro - pop highway to hell			1
the duet with @entity89 is called i should ’ve @entity99 , which sounds a bit creepy			2
especially for a woman who famously had a stalker , a former boyfriend against whom she had to take out a restraining order			2
and although @entity89 and @entity1 recorded separately , @entity1 has said : ‘ i think our voices work so well together			1
’ of course , @entity1 is not the only @entity23 star making a comeback			1
@entity110 has just released an album and a single			2
@entity113 are back on the road			2
stars : @entity1 , along with fellow members @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity91 , unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs with @entity2 @entity121 and @entity122 have just finished a @entity124 concert tour , a musical event that prompted one reviewer to report that their show ‘ was so spectacularly dreadful on so many fronts that it set a new benchmark in light entertainment atrocities ’			1
a reminder , if any was needed , that a tiptoe down the path of return is fraught with peril			0
sometimes we like our pop gods fossilised in the past , a lovely fly caught in the amber of our memories			0
often we do n’t want them to come back at all , ruining everything by reminding us all of how old we ’ve become — and disappointing devotees by being not much more than diluted , lumbago - racked versions of their former glories			0
collaboration : @entity1 's new album , her first for nine years , includes a duet with @entity89 for fans will always compare the older celebrity with their younger selves — and few come off better in the evaluation			1
it is even worse for @entity1 , who was n’t just a star , but a member of one of the most successful bands in pop history			1
along with fellow members @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity91 , @entity2 unfurled a seemingly endless parade of pop songs that became hits all around the world			1
famously , they were two married couples when they first topped the charts			0
after having two children , @entity1 and @entity117 split up in 1979 , followed by @entity118 and @entity168 three years later			1
yet the break - ups led only to more hits , with the poppier songs of the early years being replaced by more introspective numbers			1
six years ago , @entity173 , estimated they had sold more than 370 million albums — quite staggering			0
new audiences and @entity176 ! the musical , launched in 1999 , have kept them in the public eye			0
so what is @entity1 ’s new music like ? the good news is that @entity85 is going to be a big , big hit			1
there are , in the modern fashion , layers of electronic lushness over a moody , bittersweet ballad			0
it ’s got lots of those swooping , big chord changes favoured by @entity194 contestants			0
@entity1 ’s voice is as lovely as ever , even if at first you would struggle to recognise it as hers			1
then that wistful edge kicks in , for the tender ache in her voice remains intact ; she still sounds hurt , as if somewhere along the line she was burned by love and the cinders are still hot to the touch			0
the accompanying video is shot in an empty theatre , where @entity1 is sitting in front of a dressing table mirror rimmed with lightbulbs			1
she looks like @entity210 ! she is looking at an old photograph , and singing to an actress playing a version of her younger self in flashbacks			0
what is she singing about ? married : @entity1 and husband @entity117 , one half of the pop group @entity2 ‘ @entity219 , i made some fashion shockers ‘ wish i had n’t worn those knickerbockers			1
’ no , i ’m afraid i made that up			2
@entity1 is singing about love , she is sweating the big stuff			1
she is going on about soul searching , hearts broken , crying in the dark , time passing and that kind of baloney			0
what is going on in flashback ? boy is happy with girl , something goes wrong , boy leaves girl			0
are the young couple in the video supposed to be @entity240 and @entity117 ? i think that ’s what we are meant to conclude			0
@entity240 puts on a beany hat and looks unhappy			0
' there are periods in your life when you have to take care of yourself , and things happen and you have to be alone and have things quiet around you for a while ' - @entity1 @entity253 wanders onto the stage in the empty theatre and carries on singing			1
nipped - in jacket , wafty chiffon blouse , black sequinned leggings , tight boots			0
no @entity42 , thank goodness			0
a light touch with the lip gloss			0
no sign of a catsuit , praise the @entity267			0
for looking back now at old @entity2 videos , we can see with hindsight that @entity1 was a blonde with a bad haircut , a snub nose and terrible clothes sense , but she was so hot			1
in the old days , men dissolved into puddles in her presence			0
along with @entity168 , who had a darker beauty , they were the it - girls of the pop world			0
no one understood what these two ‘ glamazon ’ gorgeous gals were doing with those two hairy little midgets			0
and in the end , it was clearly something they wondered themselves			0
style : throughout the 70s , @entity1 never committed the sin of simplicity when it came to her dress - sense when @entity2 ended , @entity1 had a solo career of sorts — a few little hits , nothing major			1
she married briefly for a second time , then retired to grow crisp breads or something on her island			0
not much was heard of her			0
in an interview with @entity307 ’s @entity306 programme this week , @entity1 explained that her newly - invigorated musical career was a long process			1
she never ‘ closed any doors ’ , was impressed with @entity76 ’s songs and felt she could not say no. a recluse ? she says not			2
‘ there are periods in your life when you have to take care of yourself , and things happen and you have to be alone and have things quiet around you for a while , ’ she explained			0
this situation was not helped by her fear of flying , which followed a traumatic experience during one of the @entity2 tours			0
although she had therapy to deal with that , @entity1 has left the days of live performance behind her , which seems to rule out an @entity2 reunion any time soon			1
@entity1 also cheerfully admitted to taking two singing lessons to get her voice back in shape			1
she wrote one of the songs on the album herself			2
what ? slippers ? false teeth ? her old platform boots ? a pair of axes ? a bottle of vodka and a packet of crisps ? two mice in a cage ? emergency pairs of big pants ? the mind boggles			0
miss @entity1 is giving nothing away , so fans will have to wait until may to find out			1
in the meantime , i really hope the new album does not disappoint			0
for i can still remember all the lyrics to the @entity2 hits , that sound as freshly minted today as they were when they were first recorded			0
it is a big legacy to live up to			0
i also remember saving and saving and saving the wages earned from my saturday job in a hairdresser ’s to buy a pair of pink pearlised leather boots just like hers			0
yet it would be awful if , at this stage of our lives — for both of our sakes — the new @entity210 - alike @entity1 produced something that was just			1
