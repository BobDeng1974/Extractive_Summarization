they also spent their own money building a wooden hut for the cat and there is a mural in the hostel devoted to it			1
but manager @entity58 , 32 , said that although @entity15 used to be friendly and affectionate , since the attack his personality has changed completely			1
he said : ' he doesnâ € ™ t seem to be suffering physically but he is definitely wary of humans at the moment			0
' he will normally wander up to people and stand and the door and wait for them to let him in			2
' now he will start running rather than come up to you - he is very wary			0
' mr @entity58 described the attack as ' disgusting '			1

he said : ' i was disgusted that someone could do it and it looked like he enjoyed it			0
' it 's the size of the guy in comparison to the cat			0
