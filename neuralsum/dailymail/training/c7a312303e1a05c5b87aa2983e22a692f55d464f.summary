@entity5 's attorney , @entity17 , had argued that text messages sent by the 17 - year - old - in which he describes being ' angry ' following a fight with another teen on the night he was fatally shot by @entity5 - should be heard by a potential jury because it 's ' relevant to [ @entity8 's ] emotional state , ' and would strengthen the defense 's claim that @entity8 was the aggressor in the struggle that ultimately took his life			1
