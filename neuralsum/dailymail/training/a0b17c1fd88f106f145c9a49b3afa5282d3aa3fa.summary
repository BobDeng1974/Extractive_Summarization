for more stats and facts from @entity2 , click here for our brilliant @entity4 if @entity7 is to quell the growing discontent among @entity10 supporters , then he 'll need @entity11 by his side			1
the @entity14 international was on hand to ease the pressure on his manager on tuesday night , scoring the winner , his first goal since march , against @entity20			1
@entity11 , making his return from a three - match suspension , is fully fit again after an achilles injury caused him to miss the back end of last season , the @entity26 and the start of the current campaign			2

' i 've been lucky enough to play with some of the best players in the world , and if he keeps progressing ( @entity11 can get there ) , ' said @entity7			1
' he offers you that potency in attack			0
he had that really bad injury , and his suspension never helped our case , but he 's been excellent since he 's been back			0
' @entity7 will be hoping his talismanic striker can now stay injury - and suspension - free as he looks to keep the wolves from his door			1
@entity10 supporters have been asking real questions of @entity7 ; the swell of opinion for the @entity102 to leave is growing			1
and pressure from the terraces looked to be transmitting onto the field as @entity10 started nervously			0
@entity60 was saved by @entity63 's goalline clearance after his fumble from @entity49 's shot was stabbed goalwards by @entity51			0
the visitor 's then faced strong appeals from @entity20 for a penalty after @entity65 tangled with @entity112 , before @entity51 missed his kick after @entity45 's inviting cross			2
@entity10 's uncomfortable start continued as @entity116 , fresh from his first @entity10 goal against @entity118 on saturday , limped off in the ninth minute with a hamstring problem as the @entity120 provided nothing in the way of attacking intent inside the opening 15 minutes			1
however , in the 28th minute @entity10 provided a spark - invariably it came from @entity11 , who turned @entity43 beautifully on the edge of the area before unleashing a right foot drive that @entity38 tipped over the bar			1
there was no goal , but at least it was something ; a semblance of fight from @entity10			2
and it proved the catalyst @entity10 's winner four minutes later in a moment @entity20 defender @entity43 will want to erase from memory			1
the centre half , located on the right - hand touchline , only needed to clear @entity41 's pass to avert any danger - instead he dallied and was robbed by @entity11 , who took full advantage by striding forward before slotting past @entity38			2
@entity11 took advantage of an error by @entity43 to score the only goal of the match - click here to see more of our brilliant @entity4 palace midfielder @entity48 was unable to close down @entity11 in time to stop the @entity14 international from scoring @entity60 ensured @entity10 stayed in front before the break , saving from @entity153 and @entity49 as @entity20 pressed for an equaliser before @entity50 sent a diving header wide in the 50th minute			1
had @entity11 got a touch on @entity67 's dangerous inswinging free - kick or @entity71 finished with just @entity38 to beat then the second half would have been far more comfortable for @entity7			1
but it was from pleasant for the @entity102 as @entity52 , on for @entity51 at half - time , was denied a penalty after @entity63 looked to have pulled the striker down - much to @entity34 's dismay			0
the @entity20 boss was even more bewildered when @entity52 , @entity49 and @entity43 all failed to get a toe on @entity46 's low ball across the face of goal in the final minute			2
' we are looking for a player like @entity11 in january , i think held @entity10 together tonight , ' admitted @entity34			2
' we should have had a penalty , though , the referee 's in a bad position and did n't see @entity52 was pulled back			0
