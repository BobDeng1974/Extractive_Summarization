@entity23 ( pictured ) says she was ‘ shocked and hurt ’ to be told @entity8 would not be allowed to move into @entity11 when she tried to register him for a camping trip in july last year mrs @entity23 says she was ‘ shocked and hurt ’ to be told @entity8 would not be allowed to move into @entity11 when she tried to register him for a camping trip in july last year			1
mr and mrs @entity23 , who volunteered for @entity28 committees and accompanied their son to sessions , were told their child posed a ‘ significant health and safety risk to other scouts and himself ’			1
she said : ' i could n’t believe the scout leader at the time was refusing @entity8 a place , based on an assumption because of his disability			0
' it was only when i was registering @entity8 to attend the trip that the leader delivered the news			0
' he then emailed me back saying @entity8 could n’t progress to @entity11 or attend the camping trip , because " he lacks independence "			0
' to be told , with no prior discussion , that he was not progressing to @entity11 with his friends was devastating			2
' i was also shocked and hurt to receive the news by email - especially after acting as parent rep for the group			1
' a @entity56 spokesman vowed that the organisation would ' take on board any lessons learned in this case ' the scout leader and a district commissioner then asked mrs @entity23 , 44 , from @entity63 , @entity64 , for an apology when she made an official complaint of disability discrimination			1

he did n’t cause any problems whatsoever			0

his former leaders had discussed @entity8 ’ needs with us , but the scout leader did n’t - and would n’t back down on his decision			2
' when he started at @entity68 he could say about seven words and now he ’s this articulate , funny , happy boy			1
it helped him so much			0
' he is in special needs education and even though it is amazing , this allowed him to make friends near his home and do something in his own community			2
' the whole family were very much involved with both groups , my 13 - year - old daughter is a member of the same scouts			1
i could n’t believe they chose to tell me via email			0
they did n’t try and explain why , or have a discussion with us			0
it was horrific after four very happy years			2
' we faced huge legal costs if we lost , but i felt a duty to fight this for other children out there			0
' mrs @entity23 sought legal advice from @entity102 ’ advice and @entity104			0
the action was later settled before the case went to county court and the @entity56 paid £ 5,000 in compensation , which will be held by the court until @entity8 is aged 18			1
@entity8 has since taken up a place at the 79th @entity112 ’s @entity111 in @entity64 , but mrs @entity23 says @entity8 has already missed out despite moving to another group			0
she said : ' the financial compensation ca n’t replace the friendships and experiences @entity8 has missed			0
' we want to be lessons to be learned to avoid another family going through the distress that we have experienced			2
' @entity56 spokesman @entity122 said : ' we do intend to take on board any lessons learned in this case			1
