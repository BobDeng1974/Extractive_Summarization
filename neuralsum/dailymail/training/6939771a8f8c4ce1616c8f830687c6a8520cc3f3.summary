hurrah , the @entity0 are back ! this season ’s clothes could n’t have been a bigger throwback for me when i opened one of the fashion magazines this month			1
from the fringing to the pretty @entity10 dresses and floppy hats , i remember it all the first time round , when i was a successful model who travelled around the world on fashion shoots for adverts and magazines			1
my favourite items in the @entity0 were the sweet , flowing dresses i might have worn when at @entity22			1
i was very much a flower power kind of girl , and still adore wearing bright colours			1
but now , at 75 , can i really do the same trends the second time round ? obviously things are different now — back then i would wear padded knickers and bras to give my slight frame added curves , but now i look for more flattering cuts to shape my curves			1
i might have styled it with a belt , jacket and hat , and my hair would have been worn loose or scrunched on top of my head in a top knot			1
@entity51 , £ 79 , @entity52 by @entity53 at @entity54 skirt , £ 28 , glamorous at @entity56 shoes , £ 250 , available from february 4 at @entity58 @entity59 this dress is a little bit shorter than i usually go for			1
but when paired with an over-the - knee boot , it ’s surprisingly sophisticated			1
i have a pair of boots like this that are over 30 years old , but i still wear them and love them just as much			1
back then i could get away with wearing it with court shoes , but there ’s no doubt boots are more flattering now as they hide the leg			1
dress , £ 99 , @entity76 at @entity77 boots , £ 160 , duoboots.com the ultimate @entity79 this is a lovely look , and the faux - fur gilet is fantastic			2
i would very happily wear this out and about			2
this type of @entity10 glamour looks gorgeous , and the gilet will smooth over any lumps and bumps you might rather were hidden when you get to my age			2
dress , £ 9.99 , zara.com @entity79 , £ 60 , riverisland.com shoes , £ 36 , next.co.uk @entity91 as tv ’s @entity92 , i have an entire wardrobe of green			2
i find it fascinating that this length is coming back into fashion , too			2
it ’s very elegant and i love the sleeves			0
the fringed bag is giving me major feelings of deja vu , too			0
back then , i might have paired a wicker basket with this dress but now it ’s always a handbag			0
dress , £ 48 , @entity56 bag , £ 99 , clarks.co.uk shoes , £ 255 , russellandbromley.co.uk day - to - night glamour this look is pure @entity112 , who came to power in 1979			0
white trousers are one of the easiest routes to easy glamour			0
back then , women would have worn pussybow blouses with a suit or something more elegant if they were going out in the evening			0
i would have worn something bright with these trousers , but i love this blouse			0
@entity125 , £ 125 , and trousers , £ 129 , reiss.com shoes , £ 250 , available from february 4 at @entity58 @entity127 now this is a dress i might have worn at @entity22 , with flip flops and a floppy hat			0
