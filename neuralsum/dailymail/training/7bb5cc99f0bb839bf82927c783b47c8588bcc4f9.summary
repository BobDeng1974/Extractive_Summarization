several residents of @entity70 , one of the more remote atolls in the @entity74 island chain nation , had reported seeing a low - flying aircraft on the morning of march 8 , when @entity38 disappeared en route from @entity41 to @entity77			1

' the working assumption is that it went south , and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor , ' said the source			0

@entity7 authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations , but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across @entity7 to the @entity240			2

merchant ships were also asked to look for any trace of the plane			0
nothing has been found , the @entity303 said			0
@entity39 has said it was reviewing radar data and deployed 21 satellites to search the northern corridor of the search area stretching as far as @entity172 , although it is considered less likely that the plane could have taken that route without being detected			1
