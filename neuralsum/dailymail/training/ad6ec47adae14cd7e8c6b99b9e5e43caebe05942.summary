with that estimate , @entity3 becomes more valuable than brands that have been cemented in @entity10 ’s culture for decades – including @entity12 , @entity13 , and even @entity14			2
a single share for the eight - year old company is expected to open at $ 38 , helping disprove naysayers ’ warnings of the site ’s long - term potential , even as @entity21 pulled their advertisements			1
reason to smile : @entity3 , created by @entity25 some eight years ago , has hiked up the size of its initial public offering by almost 25 per cent not lovin ' it : @entity3 could surpass other global brands like @entity29 's , left , and @entity14 , right the @entity10 automaker confirmed a report by the @entity32 today			1

@entity21 said it will still have @entity3 pages marketing its vehicles , but it will drop use of paid @entity41 can create a @entity3 page at no cost			1
it is crucial for @entity3 's future that the rest of the auto industry continues to buy adverts on the site			2
the @entity32 notes that it spends the most advertising dollars in the @entity10 - last year alone , the industry spent $ 13.89billion on advertisements			2
' we regularly review our overall media spend and make adjustments as needed ... it 's not unusual for us to move our spending around various media outlets - especially with the growth of multiple social and digital media outlets , ' @entity21 said in a statement			2
@entity21 spends about $ 40 million on its @entity3 presence , but only about $ 10 million of that is paid to @entity3 for advertising			1
the rest covers the creation of content and the agencies involved , @entity64 said			0
@entity3 , the company founded eight years ago by @entity25 in a @entity71 dorm room , said on wednesday it will add about 84 million shares to its ipo , floating about 421 million shares in an offering expected to be priced on thursday			1
out : @entity21 said that @entity3 ads do n't pay off and withdrew their advertising ahead of the social media company 's ipo @entity3 fever : @entity3 says 25 per cent more shares will be sold as investors clamor for a piece of the year 's hottest stock offering on @entity85 invested : an investor holds literature explaining the @entity3 stock after attending a show for @entity3 's ipo earlier this month the additional shares will be sold by early investors including @entity95 co-founder @entity94 , @entity97 ' @entity96 and investment manager @entity98 , the company said in a filing			1
the company itself has not increased the number of shares it will sell			0
@entity25 's voting power will be reduced to about 55.8 per cent from about 57.3 per cent after the ipo as a result of the issue of additional shares , the company said			2
the expanded size , coupled with @entity3 's recently announced plans to raise the ipo price range , would make @entity3 the third - largest initial share sale in @entity10 history after @entity116 and @entity21			1
the social networking company is drumming up massive demand for the offering even as slowing revenue and user growth spur questions about the long - term @entity3 story			2
those concerns over revenue growth were underscored on tuesday , when @entity21 said it planned to pull out of advertising on @entity3			1
business as usual : workers continue their daily tasks at the @entity3 office in @entity131 , @entity132 ahead of the ipo thanks : @entity3 released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $ 5billion initial public offering			1
but some users do n't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money ' this is much more a spectacle , a media event and a cultural moment than it is an ipo , ' said @entity146 , an analyst at @entity147			0
' this is not a game of models and fundamentals at this point			0
' @entity21 's announcement , while ill - timed for @entity3 , should not seriously hurt the ipo 's reception for now as it may not be representative of advertisers ' overall attitude , said @entity157 , an analyst with @entity158			1
among the soon - to - be @entity3 millionaires and billionaires is graffiti artist @entity161 , who was commissioned to paint murals in the @entity164 @entity3 office			0
rather than receive payment , he chose to receive shares of the company ’s stock			0

likewise , @entity169 , the front man of @entity171 and activist could earn up to $ 1.5billion			0
in february , @entity173 estimated that @entity3 coo @entity174 , who is the company 's highest - paid employee , could earn as much as $ 1.25billion			1
the housing market in @entity177 is booming as well , as it anticipates a whole new level of affluent young workers hoping to snatch up a luxurious home			0
' the demand for the ipo probably wo n't be affected materially by this , ' he said , adding , however , there were probably a lot of calls between underwriters and investors following @entity21 's announcement			2
the ipo , @entity177 's largest , eclipses the roughly $ 2 billion debut by @entity192 in 2004			0
the price range hike , coupled with strong results from internet and social media players @entity197 and @entity199 's @entity198 , contributed to a dotcom rally on @entity201 on tuesday			0
shares of @entity204 rose 10.3 per cent , @entity202 was up 7.7 per cent , @entity197 climbed 3.7 per cent and @entity198 gained 6.4 per cent , @entity2 reported			0
before the @entity90 size was increased , @entity3 would have raised about $ 12.1 billion based on the midpoint price of $ 36 and the 337.4 million shares on offer originally			1
at this midpoint , @entity3 would be valued at roughly 27 times its 2011 revenue , or 99 times earnings			0

@entity214 went public in 1980 at a valuation of 25 times its revenue and 102 times earnings			0
@entity3 's ipo comes as some investors worry the company has not yet figured out a way to make money from a growing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones			1
meanwhile , revenue growth from @entity3 's online advertising business , which accounts for the bulk of its revenue , has slowed in recent months			2
with some 900 million users , it had $ 1 billion in net income on revenue of $ 3.7 billion in 2011.the company has also extended the time frame for its $ 1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker @entity237 , projecting the deal would close this year instead of the second quarter as it previously indicated			2
