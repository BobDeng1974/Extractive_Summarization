@entity0 became the owner of a picturesque @entity2 inn 22 years ago , after entering a writing contest			1
now the 68 - year - old innkeeper is ready to retire and plans to hand off the keys to the @entity6 to a new owner with a new contest			1
ms @entity0 announced the contest late last year , and expects to receive 7,500 entries from prospective new owners by the may 7 deadline			1
on monday , the @entity13 spoke with ms @entity0 about her decision to finally step away from the inn she 's toiled at and invested $ 500,000 into for renovations			1
all this could be yours : the owner of the @entity6 in @entity2 is holding a contest , with the winner getting to take over ownership of the historic inn built in 1805 ' i 've been in the business 38 years so it 's time to retire , ' ms @entity0 said , adding that she 's looking forward to doing nothing in her retirement after years of 17 - hour workdays			1
ms @entity0 says she ca n't reveal the essay that won her the inn in 1993 , but she believes her 16 years running a restaurant in @entity34 helped			1
' one of the judges told me they chose me because they saw that i could carry on the inn and make it a viable business , ' ms @entity0 said			1
while ms @entity0 has the right to sell the business , as the outright owner , she has decided to give it away with a new essay contest out of goodwill			1
' i just want to pass it on to somebody else who is looking for an inn , who possibly ca n't own it on their own outright and i think this is a good way to pay it forward , ' she said			0
ms @entity0 hopes to read all of the applications by may 17 , and says she 'll be impressed by grammatically correct entries that show a passion for work			2
current owner : @entity0 ( pictured above ) has owned the @entity6 since 1993 , when she won a similar contest deadline approaching : prospective owners can apply to take over the inn by submitting a 200 - word essay and $ 125 by the deadline of may 7 the prompt for the essay is simple : ' why i would like to own and operate a country inn			1
' prospective new owners must answer the question in a pithy 200 words , and pay $ 125 to enter the contest			0
ms @entity0 will be keeping the money from the application , which could exceed the inn 's estimated value of $ 900,000			2
ms @entity0 wo n't choose the winner , though			2
instead , she 'll whittle down the list to the top 20 candidates and then let a two - person team who have no stake in the inn select the winner by may 21			2
the inn will then transfer to the new owner within 30 days , along with $ 20,000 to jumpstart the business			2
however , the new owners must agree to keep the inn , which dates back to 1805 , painted white with green or black trim			0
they must also run the property as an inn for at least one year after the handover			0
busy , busy : the inn , located three hours north of @entity89 , is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season while the new owners can revel in self - employment , the job of keeping up the inn is no easy work , ms @entity0 warns			1
the inn , located three hours north of @entity89 , is open year round and its seven rooms are routinely booked up seven days a week in the high season			0
everyday , ms @entity99 and about 10 employees work to cook breakfast , clean rooms , take reservations , check out guests and serve dinner			0
' unless you raise 14 kids , you ’re not going to be used to this , ' ms @entity0 told the @entity109			0
' look , this is something you start when you ’re young			0
it takes a lot of stamina			0
' ms @entity0 was 46 when she took over the inn , having never visited @entity2 before in her life			2
when she learned she was the lucky winner , she brought along her parents to help with the new place ( her father has since passed and mother is now in a nursing home )			0
ms @entity0 grew to love @entity2 and plans to remain in the area for the time being .			0
