the @entity18 , which found the sites last month , have been searching crash sites for years looking for @entity10 servicemen shot down over @entity13 between 1944 and 1945 by the @entity23			1
the group is now expected to receive help from the governor , who will be joined on his 12 - day trip by @entity30 veteran @entity28 and retired @entity32 @entity31			2
@entity33 said in a statement : ' somewhere in the waters of @entity13 , or deep within its marshy jungles , lie the answers some families have been waiting generations to hear			1
' @entity41 has made a mission of finding those answers , and i ’m honored to lend a hand to the 2014 expedition , both in the field and in spreading the word about this exceptional program			0
' gov @entity1 's expenses are to be paid for by the @entity18 , the @entity50 reported			1
it is not known whether wednesday 's attack at the military base in @entity57 , @entity2 , in which a soldier turned his gun on himself after killing three people and wounding 16 others , will affect the governor 's plans			1

no other parts were around			0

' then a @entity13 friend of @entity18 's told us a few years later that her father told her of watching the airplane get hit and crashing off the coast			1
' she even pointed to the area where we eventually found the aircraft			0
so her father 's recollections were passed on to the next generation , and on to us , intact			0
we 're calling her soon to let her know her father had it right			0
' the team then found the second crash site - a @entity129 , shot down by enemy ground fire - just four days later .			0
