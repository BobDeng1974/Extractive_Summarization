well - loved : mrs @entity2 has given sermons at the @entity3 for the last decade and was a popular figure and her daughter described her as her ' best friend ' the bacterial infection is called flesh - eating because of its particularly aggressive nature - skin rapidly disappears when the germ takes hold			1
@entity66 and friends of mrs @entity2 will gather at @entity68 @entity3 on june 30 to say their final goodbyes			0
while fellow victim @entity71 is still in intensive care , on tuesday doctors downgraded the 24 - year - old 's condition from critical to serious , indicating that she continues to improve after the horrible bacteria nearly took her life			1
on the same day , @entity77 , the new mother who was infected with the bacteria days after she gave birth to twins at an @entity82 hospital , improved her condition to fair after spending weeks in intensive care			2

' she 's going to have to learn to use prosthetic limbs , ' he said			0

@entity100 of @entity154 became victim number four after he cut his leg while installing a new dock at the lake on may 1			1
it was a very small cut that did n’t stop the grandfather playing golf the next day but within four days the cut had swelled and he was forced to have his leg amputated			2
despite the bizarre outbreak of the disease , dr @entity166 , of @entity167 , said people should n't over-react and become paranoid about becoming infected			0
it remains very rare , he said			0
necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
' @entity174 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			2
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			0
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			0
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			2
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			0
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons .			0
