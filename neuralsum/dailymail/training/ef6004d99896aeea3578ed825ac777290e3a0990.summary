the widows became so successful that dozens of @entity30 added ' @entity16 ' to their names even though no widow ran the house - just for its mystique and marketing value			1

' @entity102 gave these figures an independent social status in @entity15			2
unlike other women - who were the property of a father or a husband - only a widow could become a ceo			1
' in the 19th century ... if you 're not married you 're dependent on your father , you ca n't have a bank account and you ca n't pay staff			0
if you are married you are reliant on your husbands , ' explained @entity116 , @entity28 's archivist			1
' only a widow can take this position as head of a company			2
' experts say that @entity30 was one of the first industries in the modern world that women shaped and in which they enjoyed a prominent role			2
rare opportunity : unlike other women - who were the property of a father or a husband - only a widow could become a ceo we 're watching : the stern expressions of these women stare out from portraits that hang in their sprawling @entity37 - based mansions in the @entity15 region of @entity2 , the only place in the world where bubbly can legally be called @entity97			1

@entity79 exploited the chaos created by napoleonic wars to tap the @entity178 market , before taking in @entity179 and then the @entity180			0
