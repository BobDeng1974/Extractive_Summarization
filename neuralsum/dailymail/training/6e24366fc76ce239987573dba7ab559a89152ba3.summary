by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 19:41 est , 9 january 2013 @entity2 has threatened to quit the @entity3 if he is replaced as shadow chancellor by @entity5 , it was claimed yesterday			1
mr @entity2 fired his warning shot after @entity7 yesterday revealed the ' door is open ' to his brother returning to frontline politics – and refused to say that he has guaranteed the @entity12 job to mr @entity2			2
a day earlier , @entity5 used a @entity14 speech on welfare to say @entity16 should accept the government 's spending plans – which mr @entity2 has so far refused to do			1
labour leader @entity7 ( left ) has said the door is open for his brother @entity5 to return to the @entity16 frontbench , more than two years after beating him to the party 's top job some of @entity7 's allies want him to replace mr @entity2 because the latter is too closely associated with the profligate spending under the last government			1
the @entity16 leader has twice offered the shadow chancellorship to his brother , who stood down from the frontbench when his sibling beat him to the leadership in 2010			1
if @entity5 can not be coaxed back , many would like to see the job go to former chancellor @entity34			0
but friends of mr @entity2 said yesterday he would return to the backbenches rather than take any other post – an ultimatum that threatens a return to the divisive @entity16 wars of the @entity41 years			2
the left - wing @entity43 magazine reported : ' both eds insist there 's no deal to keep balls in the @entity12 brief , yet @entity5 would face a revolt by mps if he offered the post a third time to his big brother , @entity5			1
allies of the shadow chancellor whisper that he 'd take his bat and balls away and retire to the backbenches rather than swallow demotion			1
' relations between the @entity62 were badly damaged when the younger brother triumphed in the @entity16 leadership in september 2010 the piece was written by the hugely experienced journalist @entity66 , who has been close to the @entity68 camp for two decades			1
mr @entity48 ' aides dismissed the claims about an ultimatum as ' rubbish '			0
but evidence is growing the @entity16 leadership is keen to accommodate @entity5 on the front bench			2
and @entity7 yesterday said the rift in their relationship was healed , adding : ' i would n't take it as indication about a change in his view he 's not coming back to the shadow cabinet , but the door is open			0
' asked if mr @entity2 was guaranteed to keep the @entity56 's post up to the election , mr @entity5 said : ' i think @entity2 is doing a great job but i am not going to get into that [ naming your @entity3 two and a half years before the election ]			1
' shadow chancellor @entity2 has been told his job is not guaranteed until 2015 but according to reports mr @entity2 would refuse to move to another job			1
' both eds insist that there ’s no deal to keep balls in the @entity12 brief , yet @entity5 would face a revolt by mps if he offered the post a third time to his big brother , @entity5 , ' the left - leaning @entity43 reported			2
' allies of the shadow chancellor whisper that he ’d take his bat and balls away and retire to the back benches rather than swallow demotion to another portfolio			2
' an aide to mr @entity2 dismissed the suggestion as ' total rubbish '			0
@entity5 gave a bullish speech in the @entity14 yesterday , where he attacked the government ’s plans to cap benefits rises at one per cent			0
but in a sharp departure from @entity16 policy he appeared to accept the coalition ’s overall spending plans in full			0
‘ the government themselves have projected the total cost of all benefits , all tax credits and all tax relief for the next few years , and i am happy to debate priorities within that envelope , ’ he said			0
‘ i will take the envelope that they have set , but let us have a proper debate about choices , not the total sum — a priorities debate , not an affordability debate			0
’ but in an apparent slip , he also revealed his shortcomings in maths which could hamper his chances of becoming shadow chancellor , when he told @entity144 mp @entity143 : ‘ i do not want to give the you a maths lesson - i did not get good marks in maths - but percentages are percentages			1
’ @entity7 ’s first shadow chancellor @entity150 never recovered after joking that his first job was to ‘ pick up a primer in economics for beginners ’			2
@entity16 deputy chairman @entity155 has revealed the party believes a 60 - seat @entity14 majority in 2015 was now ' realistic '			1
the shadow cabinet approved his strategy to concentrate on 106 key marginal constituencies			0
it is to concentrate funds on training @entity164 - style community organisers and using social media in target areas in a bid to emulate @entity169 's electoral success in the @entity164			0
however , it suggests mr @entity5 ; s hopes of becoming @entity172 depend on gains in @entity174 and the @entity175 , with just nine seats targeted in the @entity177			0
meanwhile @entity178 briefed @entity144 mps last night that the party would focus on winning 40 seats from @entity16 and the @entity182 and shoring up support in 40 of its most marginal seats .			0

@entity16 leader @entity2 clears the way for comeback for brother @entity5
relations soured after shock victory in 2010 leadership *contest*
but @entity5 blundered in @entity194 *declaring* he was no maths whizz
@entity2 ' would quit frontbench ' if sacked as shadow chancellor , say allies
@entity202 's election *strategists* now ' *confident* ' of 60 - seat majority in 2015
