by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:20 est , 12 september 2013 supercars are not usually known for their fuel efficiency , but both @entity3 and @entity4 have debuted hybrid vehicles that are less thirsty at a petrol pump than a @entity7			1
unveiled at the @entity8 , the @entity9 can reach 60mph in less than 2.8 seconds , while @entity4 's futuristic i8 takes less than 4.4 seconds to reach the same speed			1
but the sleek sports cars are designed to be fuel efficient as well as fast			0
@entity3 's @entity14 can also do 72 miles per gallon and is almost a third more fuel efficient than the @entity7 's @entity7 , while the @entity4 i8 is even less thirsty as it can manage 113 miles per gallon			1
but the sleek sports car can also do 72 miles per gallon and is almost a third more fuel efficient than the @entity7 's popular hybrid model - the @entity7 @entity4 has finally taken the wraps off its much - teased hybrid supercar , which has a top speed of 155mph and is capable of doing 113 miles per gallon			1
the futuristic i8 is the car manufacturer 's ' most advanced ' sports car top speed : 211 mph but 93mph when purely electric acceleration : 0 - 62mph in 2.8 seconds body : the two - seater car is made of carbon fibre drivetrain : the model is a parallel full hybrid comprising a 4.6 litre engine and hybrid module with electric motor engine : the @entity40 provides 608 horsepower and together with the electric capability has 887 horsepower energy supply : lithium - ion battery and mains - compatible plug - in charger range : 18 miles when purely electric @entity45 charging times : less than 7 hours using a household socket and 2 hours on an industrial socket @entity49 : £ 537,000 @entity3 's £ 537,000 offering is a carbon fibre supercar with a plug - in hybrid drive , making it the latest racing car manufacturer to try and make more eco-friendly cars sexy			1
the company said : ' never before has a supercar designed for everyday use offered such an impressive dynamic performance combined with the fuel consumption of a compact car			2
' the car was designed from scratch to be a high - performance hybrid and is ' virtually silent ' like most electric vehicles			2
