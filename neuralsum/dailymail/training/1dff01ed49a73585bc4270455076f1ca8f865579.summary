but sinking thermometers do not bother one breed of special horses which are oblivious to the fact their environment is even colder than the @entity15			1
and while their human farm herders layer up to cope with the extreme @entity19 elements , the little @entity16 love nothing more than running about the frozen wastelands , without even the need for a blanket to keep them warm			1
with very thick and long hair , resilient skin and a layer of fat , they are the most frost resistant of all known breeds - and they simply have to be since they live harshest climate in @entity8			1
this stunning series of images shows the beautiful creatures enjoying a run about isolated fields in the diamond rich @entity61 , also known as @entity61 , an area almost the size of @entity65			2
running free : with very thick and long hair , resilient skin and a layer of fat , they are the most frost resistant of all known breeds - and they simply have to be since they live harshest climate in @entity8 snow business : a herder attempts to round up some of the ponies as they charge around the frozen @entity19 landscape let the storm rage on : steam coming from their nostrils in the sub-freezing temperatures , the horses race around in the snow with the winter sun setting on the horizon , they appear happy to gather and socialise in herds on the icy wastelands			1
the pictures were taken by photographer @entity89 during a visit to an agricultural cooperative in the village of @entity93 , about 140 miles from the city @entity95			2
