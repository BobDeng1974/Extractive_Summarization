@entity1 's biggest purpose - built air raid shelter , which could hold 6,500 people , was so sophisticated it even had electric lighting and flush toilets			1
the tunnels were dug into sandstone cliffs along the @entity7 in @entity8 in the 1930s , and were originally intended to provide car parking spaces			1
but following the outbreak of the @entity13 , the space was redeveloped as an air raid shelter where residents of @entity16 and @entity17 could hide from @entity19 bombs			1
the cliffs were first dug out to provide cellars for homes along @entity51 , one of the busiest streets in @entity8			2
as part of a plan to widen the roads , the local council bought and demolished the houses , and planned to convert the cellars into an underground car park			2
an engineering survey showed that the space was in fact unable to become a car park - but the advent of war meant that it was needed as an air raid shelter			1
bathroom : the women 's toilets , equipped with a proper flush , located deep inside the @entity8 air raid shelter gadgets : a radio , blood pressure monitor and lamp from the 1940s , pictured inside the air raid shelter 's first aid section medicine : the shelter had a first aid room to help any residents who were injured by the bombing raids equipment : gas masks which were kept in the shelter are pictured left ; right is the sick bay , where people could seek shelter while unwell extent : the shelter was going to be turned into a car park , but officials discovered that its long tunnels were unsuitable for the purpose curator @entity96 said : ' the official capacity was 3,850 , so outside they painted 4,000 - but what they did n't advertise was that they thought they could squeeze twice as many in if needs be			1
' they were used extensively by people from @entity26 and @entity106 , and even as far as @entity107			0
@entity8 was less of a target , and the underground shelters were a particularly safe place			0
' what they did was introduce season tickets - they were issued to locals , although you could write in if you had difficult circumstances			2
we still have some letters from people in @entity26 who 'd been bombed out several times			0
' it was really only a way of damping down demand , nobody was denied entrance in an alert			0
in the winter of 1940 and ' 41 , it went up to 6,500 , with another four sets of tunnel shelters			0
history : a photograph of the shelter as it appeared in the 1930s , around the time of the @entity13 's outbreak rambling : the tunnels were large enough to fit in 6,500 people , who came from all around @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity26 emergency : local councils had to establish air raid shelters to protect their populations from @entity143 bomb attacks base : the room belonging to the shelter 's warden , who would have been responsible for ensuring the safety of those inside danger : a fire bucket and hose which could have been used to control any unexpected blazes in the tunnels ' people are always surprised by the extent of them , and just how much thought and planning went into them			1
there were first aid posts , electric lighting and flush toilets , which people living in back - to - back cottages of town centres would n't have had at home			0
' the shelter space is now operated as a museum , and has been restored to how it might have looked to residents hiding there during the war			0
@entity8 was heavily bombed between 1940 and 1941 , but escaped serious damage - unlike nearby @entity26 , which as an industrial hub came under sustained attack from the @entity143 air force .			2

air raid shelter in @entity8 was dug out of caves along the @entity7 and intended to be a car park
with the advent of the @entity13 , the space became a shelter which could hide thousands of people
the air raid shelter was so popular the *authorities* had to issue season tickets in order to control numbers
