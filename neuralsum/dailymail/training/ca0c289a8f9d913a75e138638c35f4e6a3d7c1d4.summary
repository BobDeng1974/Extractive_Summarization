for those situations where there are n't enough public toilets nearby for the amount of people , new app @entity5 is here to save the day			1
through this revolutionary new mobile app , inspired by @entity10 , residents and businesses can rent out their loos to people in their immediate location who simply need to go			1
users are even able to rate their experiences afterward so others can see how each toilet stacks up			2
in instances where you really need to use the loo - but are n't near your home - simply log - on to @entity5 first conceived of in @entity22 during @entity23 , co-founders @entity24 and @entity26 routinely experienced the pain of having to pee - without having a place to do it			1
often , visitors and locals alike would opt for a ' rogue pee , ' as they describe it , which demonstrated to them the need for a legal alternative			0
currently , the app 's most popular areas are @entity22 and - surprisingly - @entity37 , @entity38 , but after a quick search , it 's clear that some of @entity42 is hopping on board , as well			1
many of the options we came across were posted by students , advertising their university 's washroom facilities			0
from the @entity51 's location , we were able to locate four toilets - for - rent , relatively nearby , in @entity54 for those who need a shower and toilet in @entity42 - and have cash to spare - look no further ! that said , we also saw a ' spacious with a shower and very private ' advert in @entity54 for Â£ 4 per use			1
the @entity62 likewise investigated @entity5 's prevalence , but in @entity64 , and found a handful of private addresses , as well as a ' cozy loft - style bathroom ' on @entity68 , @entity69 , at the @entity71 graphic design studio			0
while the bathroom at the back of the office space was n't sparkling clean , it did boast a large stack of old @entity78 magazines , fancy hand soap and ' @entity81 ' fragrance spray			0
' if you 're on a busy street in @entity64 , you 're literally surrounded by hundreds of toilets but you ca n't use them because they are in people 's apartments , ' app founder @entity89 explained to the @entity62			2
now , with the click of a button , you can check if the toilet is available			0
the owner then gets a call and can decide if they want to lend out their facilities .			0

new mobile app , inspired by @entity10 , locates nearby ( available ) toilets
residents and business can list their bathrooms and rent them out per use
currently most popular in @entity22 and @entity37 , @entity38
