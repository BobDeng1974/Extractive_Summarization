by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 12:13 est , 7 january 2014 to say that @entity2 has been affected by his size is something of an understatement			0
the @entity7 actor rose to fame on the strength of his monosyllabic performance of @entity2 , the comic foil to dr evil , the balding villain in the @entity15 franchise			1
mini-me 's name was apt - @entity2 is tiny			1
this is because the actor , who recently celebrated his 45th birthday , has cartilage - hair hypoplasia dwarfism , a rare form of dwarfism ( a medical condition causing abnormal growth )			1
as a result , @entity2 , at 2 ' 8 " , is one of the shortest people in the world			1
@entity2 's size has certainly made an impact on his career			1
as he revealed in an exclusive interview with @entity33 : ' there are n't too many people like me ... there 's a niche there , that 's part of the reason that i do the things that i do			1
along with @entity2 himself , @entity56 focuses on individuals and communities living with dwarfism all around the globe , whether that 's in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 or @entity66			1
among the more unusual characters to appear are @entity69 's ' matadwarfs ' , trying to earn a living in one of @entity73 's most brutal sporting events , bull fighting , and a group of @entity77 dwarves hoping to build a specialised town tailored to their size			1
but the first episode is dedicated to @entity2			0
in it he 'll talk about growing up with dwarfism as he travels back to his family home			1
' if my parents did n't raise me in the way that they did , ' he explains , ' i would n't be in the position i am now			0
' they raised me very independent and taught me you can do anything you want to			0
i have an average - sized brother and an average - sized sister and i had to do everything they had to			0
' we had a mid-sized farm [ in @entity97 ] , so we had to feed the cows and feed the pigs , help put the hay down			0
there was a lot of picking up wood and cutting down trees			0
' in the new documentary @entity2 hopes to reveal what life is really like when you 're born small and stay that way but the life of a farmer did n't appeal and @entity114 beckoned , and @entity2 got his first break in his mid- 20s , as a stunt double for a nine - month - old baby in the 1994 film @entity118			1
it would be another five years before he landed his break - out role as mini-me in the @entity15 : the spy who shagged me , thus guaranteeing a spot in the limelight			1
while roles like @entity2 did get him out of @entity97 , you ca n't help but wonder whether he entertains a little resentment at never playing the hero and always the comic foil because of his short stature			0
' no , i love comedies , ' @entity2 says , swatting aside the question with professional ease			0
' me and @entity45 had great chemistry between us			0
he improvises a lot and when he improvises you have to [ do it too ]			0
you have to be quick on your feet			0
[ @entity2 ] was an important role for me , it put me where i am now			0
' @entity2 returns to his @entity146 roots in the documentary but @entity2 does hope that people will also see beyond his size			1
' if i was average [ sized ] i would hope that i would still have been in a position where i 'm at , ' he insists			0
' i would hope that people see it is n't just the size			2
it 's also the talent , the artist inside me			2
' it 's for this reason that he 's ' a huge fan of @entity160 winning actor @entity159 ' who stars as @entity161 in the @entity164 series @entity162			1
' it 's so great to have that character and to have him in that show , ' @entity2 says			2
' it 's a serious role and it could have been for an average - sized person			2
he 's amazing , i ca n't say enough about him			2
it 's @entity2 's commitment to highlighting the humanity of people with his condition that persuaded him to participate in @entity56			1
' i thought it was a great idea going into the lives of so many different little people and seeing how they lived , ' @entity2 says			2
' to show there 's many little people out there who do things that people would n't think they could do			1
' basically showing the world how independent we are and also the struggles that we have in the outside world			2
so , i thought that was a great idea			0
' @entity191 said struggles can certainly be challenging			0
but ' you have to be positive and get out there and do it , ' he says			0
' there 's a lot of little people who think they ca n't do certain things , but like i say , if you put your mind to it , you can do things that average people do , just in a different way			1
' for instance , for me , if i got to a public bathroom , there 's a lot of door handles			2
' once i could n't get out because i could n't reach the handle , so i took a trash can , climbed up the sink and got out that way			0
it 's kind of like @entity214 - you improvise , you work it out			2
' it [ @entity56 ] will show [ the public ] that there are people that they probably do n't see and [ challenges in their life they ] do n't think of - just like the door handle thing			1
' @entity2 has built a big name for himself , despite standing at just 81cm tall that 's why @entity2 's ' proud to be a part of it , to show the audience that different people can do different things			1
' people with dwarfism will always be forced to navigate life differently than those without their condition			1
but fundamentally , ' they 're just people , @entity236 , the guy next door or whatever			2
' ' you do n't have to treat them any different			0
we can do anything you can do			0
do n't look at us like we 're circus people or these people that you make fun of			2
' i hope we just show people that we 're very independent and that we can do anything that normal people can do			0
