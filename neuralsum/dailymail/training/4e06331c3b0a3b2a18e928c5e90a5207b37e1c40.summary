@entity1 ’s wife has got another job working for @entity3 – after being banned from working for her husband			1
party leader mr @entity1 confessed earlier this year that he was paying his wife £ 27,000 a year from his parliamentary allowances , funded by the taxpayer , to work as his secretary – despite declaring in 2004 that ‘ @entity9 will not employ wives ’ and ‘ there will be no exceptions ’			1
now , after the @entity14 introduced new rules banning the employment of family members , his wife @entity13 has been forced to look elsewhere for work – and has found it with another @entity20			1
the move is likely to attract gibes that @entity1 and mrs @entity25 are still managing to ‘ ride the @entity37 gravy train ’			0
@entity13 , a bond broker whom mr @entity1 met during a trip to @entity40 in 1996 , has defended her role as his former taxpayer - funded secretary , saying she often worked late , and that mr @entity1 was virtually computer illiterate			1
she said : ‘ i sit at my computer in my nightie and am very dutiful			0
‘ he has a steam - powered telephone , he can send and receive texts and that ’s it			0
' if i sit him down , and there is something for him to read , he can scroll up and down , he has learned that , but that is pretty much it			0
@entity54 : @entity26 , a close friend of the @entity3 leader , has taken on @entity13 , keeping her ' on the @entity37 gravy train ' further controversy : @entity58 told youth members to copy @entity61 's ' magnetic ' rhetoric ‘ he honestly does n’t know how to [ use a computer ] and he has missed the boat , i do n’t think he ever will now			1
’ when asked earlier this year what would happen when the ban on employing family members came in , she claimed : ‘ we have not really had time to discuss it			0
i think the job carries on but i just wo n’t get paid for it			0
’ mr @entity1 ran into more controversy earlier this year when a former @entity3 mep accused him of also putting his ‘ mistress ’ on his @entity37 payroll			2
the @entity3 leader vigorously denied any relationship with @entity78 , a party spin doctor , who also refuted the claims .			2
