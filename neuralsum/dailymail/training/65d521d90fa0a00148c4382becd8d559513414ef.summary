the smoke signals that @entity1 was ready for a return to the @entity3 first emerged last summer , when @entity4 made a public play for the @entity7 midfielder			1
all was not well at @entity8 and the then @entity10 champions offered an appetising proposal			1
@entity1 said as much to friends in @entity13			2
@entity14 spoke positively in knowledge of @entity17 ’s pursuits			0
but plates shift and @entity20 ’s arrival at the @entity21 , coupled with the offer of increased football in his favoured role , provided @entity1 with a reason to stay at least another 12 months			2
the potential was there however			0
but then @entity37 smashed open the piggy bank that had been preserved to meet the cost of the @entity46 and bought @entity47 for £ 42.5m			1
during the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity1 revealed it was the @entity52 star ’s presence that meant an emotional return to @entity41 was no longer viable			1
‘ we talked with @entity37 but he said that he would find it difficult to make a place for me on the pitch as @entity47 had my position covered , ' @entity1 said			1
at 27 years old , entering his peak , remaining in @entity61 was no longer possible either , though			0
signed in 2011 as an eventual replacement for the legendary @entity64 , the plan never ran its course because @entity64 kept on playing			0
@entity67 would instead feature out wide , up front , and in the no 10 position ; effectively anywhere but the deeper role he cultivated at @entity41			2
teamwork : @entity28 's @entity74 celebrates his goal against @entity30 with team - mate @entity1 @entity76 worked : this graphic shows the build - up to @entity74 's goal and the stunning assist from @entity1 hugs all round : @entity67 also gets involved in the celebrations after @entity83 scores @entity28 's third taunt : a @entity28 fans ' banner rams home the message that @entity1 is now one of their players @entity89 and @entity90 controlled game - @entity91 @entity93 2010 - 2011 25 3 11 2009 - 2010 27 15 13 2008 - 2009 22 3 8 2007 - 2008 32 7 17 2006 - 2007 8 2 11 2005 - 2006 35 3 5 2004 - 2005 33 2 5 he would burst forward and affect matches with dynamism for @entity37 , but @entity8 ’s style , built on stranglehold possession and meticulous build - up , rarely afforded the kind of counter-attacking opportunity that @entity1 would gleefully seize			1
as such , @entity8 never saw him at his best , fans would wonder his worth , and big matches came and went without his involvement			2
‘ if you play one game , the next , and the next but then comes the big game away to @entity116 and we are losing 4 - 0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down , ’ he told @entity107 at the start of last season when asked about the disappointment of missing out on @entity8 ’s 2012 - 13 @entity112 run			1
‘ it ’s all about continuity			0
it ’s more mental than anything else			0
everyone knows @entity64 and @entity124 are very good			0
i know what i can do , but sometimes you think , “ come on , give me a chance boss ”			0
’ @entity67 would add : ‘ in @entity10 , you always have that extra bit of freedom as a player			2
you know that , if you misplace a pass , the fans are going to support you			0
and , in my case , it was a bit different because the supporters saw in me someone who had been at the club as a kid , left and then returned for a big fee			0
’ dominance : this heat map shows how impressive @entity1 ' performance was at @entity34 on monday international duty : @entity1 ( left ) chases @entity143 ( centre ) during @entity146 's 5 - 1 defeat by @entity147 in @entity49 commitment : @entity1 is approaching 100 caps for his country after two appearances at the @entity48 home : @entity1 ( centre ) never produced his best at @entity8 due to the @entity157 club 's style of play put it here : @entity1 shakes the hand of @entity8 team - mate @entity161 during a friendly in @entity163 last year in that light the £ 30m transfer to @entity28 smacks as obvious			1
@entity91 ’s footballing philosophy will provide @entity1 with a platform to play his way , while the club ’s fans will enjoy each assist or goal that little bit more given it will hurt those in north @entity13 who used to sing his name			1
‘ there were some very good options and i chose between the best two or three , ' said @entity1			2
‘ i spoke with @entity91 and he said what i wanted to hear and things went very quickly from there			2
’ for @entity28 , securing a creative midfielder with the passing vision and range of the @entity184 this summer was just as vital as getting a striker of genuine class			1
for all the talents of @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity74 , @entity1 offers a different element ; a midfield foundation of presence and poise – a catalyst to change defence into attack			1
he is also well versed in the physicality and pace of the @entity3			0
tracking back : @entity1 chases @entity199 during @entity41 's @entity112 clash with @entity8 in 2011 key man : @entity1 celebrates with fellow @entity202 after @entity41 beat @entity8 2 - 1 in 2011 mentor : a young @entity67 with former boss wenger at @entity41 's training ground in @entity206 that much was evidenced at @entity34 , as @entity1 returned to the @entity3 after a three - year absence as if he had never been away			1
the pass for @entity74 ’s goal took the breath away , the clearest illustration of what he had been unable to do consistently at @entity8			0
but it was his stature and composure across the pitch that will have pleased @entity91 most			0
after full - time the @entity218 took a swipe at how many positions @entity1 had been forced to fill at the @entity21			1
here , we will treasure you , was the message			0
it was an unnerving start that may make @entity37 nervous			0
he must trust that @entity47 , a @entity48 winner who is in his first full season in @entity10 , can prove his value yet .			1

signs that @entity1 was ready for a return to @entity10 came in 2013
@entity37 always believed that any move back to the @entity3 would come this summer
@entity41 had a first - option clause of £ 25m to bring @entity1 back to the @entity46
@entity37 bought @entity236 midfielder @entity47 for £ 42.5m
@entity47 's presence meant that a return for @entity1 was no longer viable
*fabregas* signed for @entity91 's @entity28 in a £ 30m switch from @entity8
@entity1 was in impressive form during @entity28 's 3 - 1 win over @entity30
