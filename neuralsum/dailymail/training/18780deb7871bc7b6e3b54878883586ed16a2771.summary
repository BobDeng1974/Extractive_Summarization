' we took this boy who started with us when he was eight years old , and it seemed to be what happens with child stars over the course of time			0
' he 's now making $ 300,000 per week , which is not a bad salary for a 19 - year - old kid , and he went on a religious channel and urged people not to watch the show because it was filth			1

friends : @entity3 and his spiritual advisor @entity102 share a joke ' part of the reason @entity3 is so wary of the [ tv ] industry and so involved with the church is that he 's seen what 's happened to @entity56 [ @entity56 ] front and center			1
