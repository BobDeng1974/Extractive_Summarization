@entity0 turns up bleary - eyed and takes a moment to finish his coffee before trying to focus his mind on @entity5 ’s helicopter , his ambition to own more houses than @entity8 and playing darts with @entity10			1
it is 11am , but the reigning world darts champion takes a good 10 minutes to compose himself			1
‘ it ’s too early , ’ the 25 - year - old @entity14 calls across the room			1
it is clear , early on , that this is going to be a very unusual interview			2
@entity20 , who is preparing to defend his world title , eventually ambles over			1
i ask about the story of him tiling @entity26 ’s roof when he was an apprentice , before his darts career took off in his late teenage years			1
@entity0 is looking forward to defending his @entity30 title the @entity14 won his first world title at @entity32 last year ‘ that ’s not true , ’ he says			1
‘ i was doing his neighbour ’s house			2
i ’ve never met @entity26			2
i ’ve met a lot of footballers , but not @entity26			0
‘ i speak to @entity10 regularly			1
@entity39 has been to the darts a couple of times			2
it ’s nice and it ’s good for the sport			0
it does n’t make a difference to me — i just want to do well for the ones who ’ve paid for the tickets , ’ he adds in his thick @entity14 accent , laughing loudly			1
@entity20 befriended his compatriot @entity10 , the @entity53 and @entity54 defender , when he was at a @entity56 darts match in @entity57			1
he reveals that @entity10 has a dartboard hanging on a door in his house and marks on the side whenever people throw 180s or finish with a score over 100			1
@entity20 does n't think @entity8 's haul of 16 world titles will ever be matched @entity8 and @entity20 will be among the favourites for the title when the tournament commences ‘ i went there for practice and a bit of a chat and he was marking all these things down for me on his door , ’ @entity20 recalls			1
‘ i play a bit of darts and snooker with him			1
i ’ve played with a couple of footballers			0
@entity10 and @entity82 are the best			1
’ now , when @entity20 is competing in the @entity83 , he meets @entity84 for a coffee or they play darts and snooker together			1
‘ he won the last time we played snooker , ’ @entity20 adds , looking slightly annoyed			1
‘ it ’s always a tight game because we ’re both rubbish			0
he ’s never taken a game off me in darts , though			2
’ @entity20 is the world no 1 and is something of a sensation in the sport			1
by 17 he had become the youngest player to win the @entity99 and throw a televised nine - dart finish			2
@entity20 has made a sensational rise in recent years having endured a tough spell @entity20 plays darts with @entity53 's @entity10 but he went through a tough spell until two years ago , when he began to zoom up the rankings from 38 and became the youngest person to win the @entity107 last year aged 24 , a title he will defend at @entity109 ’s @entity32 when the tournament starts on thursday			1
consider that 16 - time world champion @entity8 — ‘ @entity113 ’ — did not break through until he was 29 , it is some achievement			1
it is why @entity116 footballers come to watch him play			0
but @entity20 does not believe @entity8 ’s record world - title haul can ever be matched because there are now so many high - quality players on the circuit			1
he has , however , thought of another way to catch him			0
‘ i was living with my parents two - and - a - half years ago and now i have two houses , ’ he explains			2
‘ i ’m going to try to build it up			0
trying to catch @entity8 , he ’s got a bit more			1
he ’s got about 12 houses			0
‘ i ’ve done all the hard work to get in this position			0
that ’s why i ’m strong			0
’ he tails off , pausing to consider how best to explain			0
‘ i need to think how to put this			0
it ’s too early , ’ he repeats			0
i point out that it is now 11.30			0
‘ you do n’t know the life of a darts player , ’ he says			2
‘ i was up late last night , i went to the @entity138 ’ @entity140 awards			0
@entity141 sponsor them as well as the @entity30			0
’ after a moment , he forgets the point he was making			0
i mention that @entity5 was there to pick up the @entity147 player of the year award			2
‘ with a helicopter , ’ he adds			0
‘ i do n’t have a helicopter yet			0
@entity150 lost the @entity116 final , he ’s not even world champion			2
’ @entity153 will show the @entity154 exclusively live on the @entity156 channel starting next thursday .			0

@entity0 will begin world title defence next week
@entity14 won his first @entity107 at @entity32 last year
@entity20 regularly plays darts and snooker with @entity10
the 25 - year - old does n't think @entity8 's haul of 16 titles will be beaten
