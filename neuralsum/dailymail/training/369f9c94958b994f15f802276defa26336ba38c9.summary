lord @entity0 was contacted just three hours after the death of the weapons inspector a previously unpublished document which reinforces claims that the investigation into the death of dr @entity7 was an establishment ‘ whitewash ’ has been obtained by @entity10			1
a letter written by @entity0 , who chaired the public inquiry into dr @entity7 ’s death , shows he was asked to do the job just three hours after the @entity17 weapons expert was found dead			1
at that point he had not been identified and no cause of death had been established			1
@entity0 was contacted by @entity21 , @entity23 ’s former flatmate who was @entity24 and played a key role in the events leading up to the @entity27 , and the handling of dr @entity7 ’s death			1
the letter has come to light as campaigners prepare to mount a silent vigil in @entity33 on thursday to mark the tenth anniversary of dr @entity7 ’s death			1
it is the latest – and most striking – evidence of the extraordinary haste with which the @entity38 set up an inquiry to replace the usual coroner ’s inquest			1
dr @entity7 ’s body was found on the morning of july 18 , 2003 , in woods close to his @entity45 home , shortly after he was exposed as the source of a @entity48 news report questioning the grounds for war in @entity17			2
critics have never been satisfied with the conclusions of the @entity53 , which decided that dr @entity7 , 59 , who worked for the @entity54 , died from loss of blood after cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife			0
dr @entity7 during questioning by the @entity60 select comittee , in @entity33			0
dr @entity7 , who worked for the @entity54 , died from loss of blood after cutting his wrist with a blunt gardening knife thursday ’s vigil , to be held outside the @entity63 in @entity33 , will highlight the fact that no coroner ’s inquest has ever been held into his death			1
there have been claims @entity0 ’s suicide verdict was flawed and failed to take account of key medical and other evidence			1
some claim it was part of a cover - up			0
a decade after dr @entity7 was found dead , mr @entity23 remains acutely sensitive to the accusation that he has ‘ blood on his hands ’ over the death			1
lord @entity0 ’s letter to @entity82 mp @entity81 states : ‘ on july 18 , 2003 , i was telephoned to my room in the @entity84			1
i do not remember the precise time but my recollection is that it was about noon			0
i think the lord chancellor [ @entity21 ] spoke to me and asked me to come to see him in his room in the @entity84 [ where ] he asked me to conduct an inquiry into the death of dr @entity7 and i agreed to do so			1
’ according to police records , the 999 call to report the discovery of a body had been made barely three hours earlier , at 9.20am			2
the letter that has been newly revealed shows that @entity0 was asked just hours after dr @entity7 's death in addition , a @entity98 response from the @entity99 details two phone calls made that day , between mr @entity23 , en route from @entity103 to @entity104 , and @entity21			1
they spoke between 12.10pm and 12.13pm and again between 12.20pm and 12.25pm – the time when , according to @entity0 ’s letter , he was being appointed by @entity21			1
although the details of the conversations have not been disclosed , the timing suggests @entity21 may have consulted @entity23 on his choice of @entity0 to lead the inquiry			1
having secured @entity0 , @entity21 used an obscure law to replace a coroner ’s inquest with the non-statutory public inquiry			1
police records show that by midday on july 18 , the only medical professionals who had viewed dr @entity7 ’s body on @entity121 were experienced ambulance crew members @entity123 and @entity124			2
@entity0 was contacted by @entity21 ( left ) , @entity23 's ( right ) former flatmate who was @entity24 and played a key role in the handling of dr @entity7 's death both have voiced scepticism about the manner of his death , saying there was very little blood when they arrived , not an amount consistent with a wrist slashed by a knife , and believe his body was moved after the volunteer searchers found it but before they saw it			1
many senior medical professionals have also argued that dr @entity7 could not have bled to death by severing the tiny artery he apparently cut with his blunt knife			2
@entity21 was also involved in the decision to overrule warnings that the war could be illegal			0
the organiser of thursday ’s protest , retired @entity150 worker @entity149 , said : ‘ i ’m motivated by civic duty and respect for the law			2
i ’ve long felt there was something suspicious about dr @entity7 ’s death and the fact there has n’t ever been a full inquest			1
i want to help secure one			0
anyone is welcome to join us from 2pm to 4pm on thursday			0
’ neither @entity21 nor @entity0 was available for comment			1
by @entity165 humble civil servant dr @entity7 was driven to his death by vicious @entity167 this thursday , a small group of people will mount a vigil outside the @entity63 in @entity33 to mark the tenth anniversary of the biggest @entity173 political scandal in half a century			2
unlike most demonstrators , they have no political axe to grind , just one thing in common			0
they remain outraged by the tragic death of dr @entity7 , a humble civil servant who devoted his life to serving his country			2
his ‘ crime ’ was to let the cat out of the bag over the @entity38 ’s dirty secret : how it lied about @entity188 ’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction to con the @entity173 public into backing the @entity27			1
and yet the truth would never have been known but for dr @entity7			0
a few weeks after letting it slip , almost casually , to a @entity48 reporter , and inadvertently provoking a disgusting , @entity38 inspired witch - hunt , he became another fatality of the @entity27			1
i reported on @entity7 ’s death for this newspaper			1
indeed , @entity10 played a not insignificant role in the controversy			0
i have never believed @entity7 was murdered by secret agents acting for the government or anyone else			0
but i do believe he was driven to his death by the government as part of a desperate attempt to kill the scandal he exposed over tea at @entity33 ’s @entity210 with the @entity48 ’s defence correspondent , @entity211			2
four weeks after the war ended , @entity211 told the today programme on may 29 , 2003 , the government probably knew all along its claims about @entity215 were wrong			0
at first , the government ’s response was muted			0
four days later , on june 1 , @entity10 published an article by @entity211 which accused @entity23 ’s spin doctor @entity219 of ‘ sexing up ’ the @entity215 intelligence dossiers			1
@entity219 made no complaint to this newspaper about the article then , or since			0
@entity219 resigned as @entity23 's press secretary a month after dr @entity7 's death he could n’t , because he knew it was true			1
and he knew that unlike the @entity48 , this newspaper had shown it was immune to his bullying			0
instead , the government aimed its fire at the @entity48 and @entity7 , easy meat for @entity23 and @entity234 vicious @entity233 operation to smear and ‘ out ’ @entity7 was launched			2
if they thought this decent , private , patriotic man would crumble under the pressure , they were right			0
no one is suggesting they thought @entity7 would end up dead			0
a mail on sunday reporter was with @entity23 on a trip to the @entity244 the day @entity7 ’s death was announced			1
the newsman challenged white - faced @entity23 at a press conference : ‘ have you got blood on your hands ? ’ @entity23 stared in stony silence – and walked off			2
dr @entity7 exposed the scandal over tea with the @entity48 ¿ s defence correspondent , @entity211 for once , lost for words			0
at the time , this newspaper was criticised for asking such a provocative question			0
ten years later , not only does it look fair , the honest answer in the eyes of many , including me , would have been ‘ yes ’			0
no one in @entity264 took @entity7 ’s death more badly than @entity219			2
again , with good reason			0
when he resigned as @entity23 ’s spin doctor a month after @entity7 died , he ‘ spun ’ it as a long - planned decision			1
in truth , he was forced out by @entity23 , who realised he was out of control			2
yes , it is true that the @entity53 into @entity7 ’s death blamed the @entity48 , not @entity23 and co for his death and none of the other @entity17 inquiries have fully called them to account over their conduct of the war			1
but as we report above , @entity0 is largely discredited			2
and the word is the @entity280 into the war , due to report next year , will finally name and shame the guilty men			0
regardless of minor flaws in the @entity48 ’s report about the ‘ sexed up ’ intelligence , it remains the biggest @entity173 political scoop in modern times			0
less entertaining than @entity289 expenses , yes , but far more important than fiddled duck houses			0
despite inflicting appalling damage on the @entity48 for exposing the truth about the @entity215 dossiers , @entity219 is regularly given a platform by @entity295			0
will they ask him for an interview on thursday to talk about the tenth anniversary of the @entity7 tragedy , a subject about which he knows more than most ? do n’t hold your breath .			0

letter from @entity0 shows he was asked three hours after the death
he had not been identified and no cause of death had been established
@entity0 was contacted by @entity23 's friend and former flatmate @entity312 *falconer*
is evidence of the extraordinary haste with which the @entity38 set up an inquiry to replace the usual coroner ’s inquest
