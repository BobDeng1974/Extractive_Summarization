' well i think , our head of the intelligence community , @entity20 , has acknowledged that i think they underestimated what had been taking place in @entity5 , ' mr @entity0 said			1
conversely , the @entity2 overestimated the ability of the @entity28 army to fight the militant groups , @entity0 said in the interview taped on friday , days after the president made his case at the @entity33 for action			1
' but over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the @entity5 civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , ' @entity0 said according to a clip of the interview broadcast earlier			1
' and so this became ground zero for jihadists around the world			0
' however , the president says he is now committed to breaking up @entity12 in order to give the @entity28 people time to establish a stable democracy			1
' it ’s so important for us to recognize part of our solution here is going to be military , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we just have to push them back and shrink their space and go after their command and control and their capacity and their weapons and their fueling and cut off their financing and work to eliminate – the flow of foreign fighters			1
' speaking to @entity85 's 60 minutes , he said the militants had used the chaos of the @entity5 civil war , when large swathes of the country were ungoverned , to ' reconstitute themselves ' @entity0 outlined the military goal against the @entity4 : ' we just have to push them back , and shrink their space , and go after their command and control ' @entity0 last week expanded @entity2 - led air strikes , which began in @entity28 in august , to @entity5 and he has been seeking to build a wider coalition effort to weaken the @entity4			1
currently , the @entity2 is working with 60 other nations in these attacks against the terrorist group			1
@entity102 , @entity103 , and the @entity104 have helped fly missions , but the president admits that the @entity2 is the country leading the coalition and he says that 's ' always the case '			1
' that 's always the case			2
we are the indispensable nation , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we have capacity no one else has			0
our military is the best in the history of the world			2
and when trouble comes up anywhere in the world , they do n't call @entity122			0

@entity12 militants are attacking the town			1
the @entity2 is currently leading airstrikes against the terrorist group with the help of some 60 other nations the terrorist - group @entity12 has been taking large swaths of @entity5 and @entity28 in the recent absence of a permanent @entity2 military presence in @entity28			1
@entity5 marching with the black flag of the @entity4 in january , in the stronghold of @entity147 mr @entity0 added : ' when an issue ... when there 's a typhoon in the @entity151 , take a look at who 's helping the @entity151 deal with that situation			1
' when there 's an earthquake in @entity158 , take a look at who 's leading the charge and making sure @entity158 can rebuild			2
that 's how we roll			2
and that 's what makes this @entity2			1
' mr @entity0 also spoke at length about what must be done in @entity5 , where @entity12 looms large			1
the current tactic of bringing down the terrorist network is also beneficial to @entity5 president @entity170 , which the @entity2 has come out against for alleged war crimes			1
the president admits that @entity170 will benefit from the current campaign to dessimate @entity12			1
' i recognize the contradiction in a contradictory land and a contradictory circumstance			0
we are not going to stabilize @entity5 under the rule of @entity170 ... for a long - term political settlement , for @entity5 to remain unified , it is not possible that @entity170 presides over that entire process			1
' on the other hand , in terms of immediate threats to the @entity2 , @entity12 , @entity187 group , those folks could kill @entity2 , ' he said			1
