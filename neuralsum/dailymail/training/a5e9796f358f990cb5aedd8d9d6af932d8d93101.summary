men , women and children were carrying out their belongings as they are were removed from the camp in @entity12 , northern @entity3			1
in the past year @entity3 has shut down many illegal camps full of @entity2 gypsies which have sprung up around the country			1
eviction : people from the @entity2 community carry their belongings into a bus as they are expelled from their camp in @entity12 , northern @entity3 destroyed : @entity22 moving equipment is used to destroy the makeshift homes removed : a child sits on his belongings as police move in to clear the camp determined : diggers moved in to make sure that the @entity2 community could not return to their temporary homes with an estimated population of about 15,000 @entity2 in @entity3 , and the government seems determined to expel as many as it can			1
in august there were similar raids and hundreds of @entity2 gypsy families being forcibly sent from @entity3 back to their countries of origin in @entity38 and @entity39			1
those evicted from camps in @entity3 were herded together under the watchful eye of @entity44 officers ( the @entity3 equivalent of the riot police ) wearing military - style blue outfits and black leather boots , then taken to airports and put on flights to their home countries			2
leaving : the residents were shipped out of the area on coaches final : a girl looks out the coach as the site is destroyed			0
there is an estimated population of about 15,000 @entity2 in @entity3 the @entity3 are so determined to move on the @entity2 that they offer them financial incentives			2
in addition to covering the cost of the trip home , the @entity3 government pays 300 euros ( £ 235 ) to every expelled @entity2 adult and 100 euros ( £ 80 ) for every child			2
reports of @entity38 gangs perpetrating organised crime , such as cashpoint fraud , are common in @entity3 — as in the rest of @entity75 — and this only serves to whip - up @entity78 sentiment			0
in total , nearly 1,000 @entity2 have been deported following at least six raids last summer			0
the exact figures are hard to establish because the @entity3 authorities are not allowed to define those they have ejected as ‘ @entity2 ’ , because this would suggest that their actions are potentially racist and therefore illegal under @entity87 law			1
battle : @entity3 has shut down illegal camps full of @entity2 gypsies which have sprung up around the country reports of @entity38 gangs perpetrating organised crime , such as cashpoint fraud , are common in @entity3 — as in the rest of @entity75 — and this only serves to whip - up @entity78 sentiment herded : people from the @entity2 community are expelled under the watchful eye of the authorities packed up : @entity2 residents put their belongings in the back of the coach before being driven away only the vulnerable — pregnant women , the frail and the elderly — are given housing by the @entity3 social services			1

‘ we ca n’t offer them a permanent housing solution , and i know there ’s a risk they will just set up another camp			0
we just do n’t have the means to deal with this kind of situation			0
’ this game of human ‘ ping - pong ’ began under the previous president , @entity130 , who ordered the ejection of around 9,000 gypsies , only for many of them to return			0
he introduced the deportation crackdown in 2010 after linking the @entity2 community to begging , prostitution and petty street crime			1
despite promising tolerance and humanitarian assistance if elected , @entity130 ’s successor , @entity143 president @entity142 also approved the eviction programme after he and interior minister @entity145 said the camps were adversely affecting the lives of the @entity3 working class living near to them			2
