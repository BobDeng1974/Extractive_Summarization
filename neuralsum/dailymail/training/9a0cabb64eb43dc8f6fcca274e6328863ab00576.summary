the strongest indication yet that @entity2 's new @entity1 will have a fingerprint scanner has been discovered by an app developer			1
a string of code discovered in the latest beta release of @entity2 's @entity9 software implies that either the @entity1 or @entity10 could come with a fingerprint scanner			1
the code describes a user touching the home button with their thumb			1
a fingerprint then appears on the screen , that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the ' recognition is complete '			2
a folder called @entity22 was also found			1
a string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of @entity2 's @entity9 software , pictured , gives the strongest indication to date that either the @entity1 or the @entity10 could have a fingerprint scanner a folder called @entity22 , pictured , was also found and the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone , or to authorise payments in the @entity33 and prevent people from stealing your phone , reading your messages or obtaining personal data rumours about a fingerprint scanner emerged before the @entity41 was released in september last year			1
@entity2 had purchased security company @entity42 , which analysts claimed was because it wanted the firm 's expertise in biometric technologies			1
the @entity41 did not include the technology , though , and this lead people to speculate that the next model - dubbed @entity1 - or later versions , such as @entity10 , would include the feature			2
in april this year , rumours surfaced that the next @entity10 model could be delayed because of this technology			2
a supply chain source in @entity55 told @entity2 was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor , and this may be causing production problems			1
earlier this month a @entity61 source claimed the date could even be pushed back to october			0
the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone , or to authorise payments in the @entity33 and prevent people from stealing your phone , reading your messages or obtaining personal data			2
the screenshots were tweeted by developer @entity74			0
rumours about a fingerprint scanner being introduced to an upcoming @entity2 handset first emerged before the @entity41 was released in september last year			1
@entity2 had purchased security company @entity42 , which analysts claimed was because @entity2 wanted the firm 's expertise in @entity81 ( near field communication ) and biometric secutiry technologies			1
the @entity41 did not include the feature , though , and this led people to speculate that the next model - dubbed @entity1 - or later versions , such as @entity10 , would include the feature			0
in april this year , rumours surfaced that the next @entity10 model could be delayed because of this technology			0
a supply chain source in @entity55 told @entity2 that @entity2 was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor , and this may be causing production problems			1
then in may , @entity99 's chief information security officer @entity98 claimed fingerprint scanners could spell the end of modern - day passwords and the technology would become more popular once @entity2 introduces it to one of its products			1
the developer code suggests the fingerprint scanner could be built into the phone 's home button , pictured			1
a supply chain source in @entity55 told @entity2 that @entity2 was trying to find a coating material that did not interfere with the fingerprint sensor , and this may be causing production problems @entity114 already uses fingerprint sensors on its @entity117 model , released in in 2011 and this feature is used in place of a password or pin lock			1
some laptops , including the @entity123 comes with a fingerprint reader built - in			0
other handsets , including @entity127 's @entity126 and @entity128 , that run @entity129 additionally have the option of enabling @entity131 - a feature that uses facial recognition to unlock the phone			2
an update to the feature recently added a ' live ' element that required a person to blink , to prove they were real and it was n't a photo being held up to the camera			2
commenting on the news , @entity142 , co-founder and technical director at @entity144 said : ' biometric authentication is not yet near the level it needs to be for the majority of consumer facing organisations to implement it in their products			0
' fingerprint scanning , eyeball scanning , voice and face recognition are all at least a decade away from being reliable enough to use as authentication methods			0
' using technology already owned by the individual , rather than a body part , such as @entity162 through mobile phones , is a more secure and cost effective method for organisations creating new products			0
' it has a 99.9 per cent reliability rate if passcodes are preloaded and is far less prone to faults so less risk of unwanted users trying to access an individual ’s details			0
' @entity114 already uses fingerprint sensors on its @entity117 model , released in in 2011 , pictured			0
the biometric scanner is shown on the top of the rear of the phone			0
this feature is used in place of a password or pin lock various rumours have suggested that the new @entity10 will be released on 6 september , 10 september and even october			2
the name has not been confirmed , but it has been dubbed the @entity1 following suit with @entity2 's @entity189 and @entity190 release schedule			1
other features expected in the next @entity2 model include a faster @entity194 processor , improved @entity196 voice recognition , including @entity196 in the car , as well as an improved camera			1
a larger @entity10 is then expected in 2014 , and @entity2 is also rumoured to be working on a budget model			2
this cheaper handset is expected to come in different colours and be made of plastic			0
it could cost as little as £ 63			0
@entity205 user @entity203 recently posted video that appears to be the first hands - on look at this rumoured plastic casing			0
in the video , @entity203 compares the current @entity10 case with the plastic model			0
