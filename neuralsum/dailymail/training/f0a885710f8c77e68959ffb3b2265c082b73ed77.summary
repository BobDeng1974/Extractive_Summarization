by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed its portable x-ray detection system that can be used by security enforcement on the go			1
dubbed the @entity7 , the @entity6 - based company said the handheld device can be used for fast , real - time detection of potential threats inside objects such as backpacks , tyres and more			1
the device reveals the interior of its target on a screen using backscatter technology , which detects radiation that reflects from a target			1
length : 11.5 in ( 29.2 cm ) width : 9.8 in ( 24.9 cm ) height : 7.6 in ( 19.3 cm ) weight : 9 lbs ( 4 kg ) operating time : 4 hrs per battery charge @entity40 : 6 in ( 15 cm ) per second ( typical ) @entity41 : 0 ° @entity42 ( 32 ° f to 113 ° f ) screen : @entity44 8.1 @entity46 pc these include drugs , explosives and even plastic guns that would otherwise be missed by more ' traditional ' x-ray systems			1
they also claim it is the world ’s first handheld @entity54 handheld imaging system			0
the device works by having a single - sided imager on the front			0
when the user presses a button on the top it begins scanning in front of it and procures a real - time image of the target on a tablet , which acts as the screen			2
this can spot materials that more traditional systems such as transmission x-ray can miss including explosives , currency , and drugs			2
the system also does not require any set - up and can be used immediately			0
and , the company added , the system is safe for operators , bystanders and the environment because the x-ray dose is within radiation safety standards , although it is not designed to scan people			0
‘ leveraging the breakthrough capabilities of our z backscatter detection technology , the @entity7 system is @entity1 's initial offering of what will be a family of portable backscatter products , ’ said @entity86 , @entity1 's president and ceo			1
when the user presses a button on the top , it begins scanning items and procures a real - time image of the target on a tablet , which acts as the screen ( demonstration shown )			2

and , the company adds , the system is safe for operators , bystanders and the environment			0
the x-ray dose is within radiation safety standards the product is a miniaturisation of the technology used in the @entity129 [ @entity130 ] already manufactured by the company , which is used to scan much larger objects like trucks and containers			2
this , said @entity86 , makes it ‘ more affordable and accessible to a broader range of customers			0
