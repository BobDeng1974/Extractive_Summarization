frozen : @entity1 , pictured with girlfriend @entity2 , died of hypothermia after a night out a university student died of hypothermia after walking home from a night out in @entity8 temperatures wearing a short - sleeved shirt			1
@entity1 could have been four times the drink drive limit when he attempted the nine - mile trek along a dual carriageway just days before his 21st birthday , an inquest heard			1
today a coroner said the student , whose full name was @entity18 but who was known as @entity1 , died of hypothermia contributed to by alcohol intoxication			1
but his mother @entity22 hit out at the conclusion - saying she still believed he was taken by someone , dumped unconscious and left to die			1
@entity27 @entity26 heard mr @entity1 was ' swaying ' sideways at a nightclub in @entity29 , @entity27 , where he was celebrating the friend 's 21st birthday after a day with his girlfriend @entity2			1
he became separated from his friends in the early hours of february 9 last year and left the town 's @entity35 nightclub at around 2.30am , attempting to return to his home in @entity38			1
friends realised the @entity41 student was missing , but after they were unable to raise him on the phone they thought he must have taken a taxi home			1
the student was found unconscious by a dog walker the next afternoon beside the @entity48 dual carriageway near @entity49			1
despite the efforts of paramedics he died later that day in the @entity52			2
@entity54 dr @entity53 gave the cause of @entity1 's death as hypothermia secondary to alcohol intoxication			1
the doctor said that toxicology tests showed @entity1 had a urine alcohol reading of 167mg , one and a half times the driving limit , and a blood alcohol reading of 56mg , below the limit			1
but he said the readings would have been lower than they were 15 hours earlier , the time when mr @entity1 was last seen alive			2
he calculated the student 's blood alcohol level could have been as high as 326mg , more than four times the drink drive limit			2
solicitor @entity71 , representing the student 's family , said the samples were not taken until three days after mr @entity1 's death and changes to his body could have artificially raised the readings			1
family : mr @entity1 pictured second from right with his father @entity81 , mother @entity22 and brother @entity82			1
a solicitor for his family questioned findings that the student could have been four times the drink drive limit missed : mr @entity1 , pictured right and with his girlfriend @entity2 ( left ) , was celebrating a friend 's 21st ' the family are obviously distressed , knowing their son , that his death certificate indicates alcohol intoxication , ' he said			1
' i put it to you there was some scope for error on the issue of intoxication ? ' the doctor said he stood by his findings			0
the student had eaten a meal and friends described seeing him drinking pints of lager , glasses of cocktails and shots of spirits during the night out			2
@entity114 , who was celebrating his birthday that night , told the hearing how mr @entity1 left his hooded top and coat at a friend 's house after eating the meal			1
they went to a couple of pubs and carried on drinking cocktails , he said			0
' i do n't think @entity1 was too drunk - probably similar to me , i guess , ' he told the court			1
' at @entity126 he had only one drink during the time he was there and i remember it was a rum and coke - he was drinking with one of my friends			2
party : mr @entity1 had been at the @entity126 nightclub in @entity135 ( pictured ) before his death dual carriageway : a dog walker found mr @entity1 near the @entity48 which connects @entity29 and @entity38 ' later , my friend , who he was spending most of his time with , said ' where 's @entity1 ? ' and we could n't see him			1
we checked the whole club			0
' mr @entity114 said it was at around 2.30am when his friend ' just disappeared '			0
he said : ' at that point i just assumed he had got a taxi home as he had done this on one or two occasions after a night out in @entity29			1
' asked about the weather , mr @entity114 said : ' i remember it being very cold and i think it was raining quite a bit			0
' he also said the group of friends were not drinking heavily and mr @entity1 had drunk ' just as much as the rest of us '			2
' i definitely can not say how much he had to drink , ' he added			0
@entity158 , another friend celebrating mr @entity114 's birthday , said he and mr @entity18 spoke regularly during the night			0
' @entity1 was fine , he did not seem drunk , ' he told the court in a written statement			2
mr @entity158 said that by the time he was in the nightclub he was drunk - describing himself as ' eight out of 10 ' on a drunkenness scale - and he assumed mr @entity1 was as well			2
response : paramedics and a fire crew from the airport came to the student 's aid but he could not be saved one friend said of mr @entity1 ( pictured with his girlfriend ) : ' @entity1 had a drink in his hand and was swaying ' ' i guess he was drunk because we had been drinking a similar amount , ' he said			1
@entity177 , who was also out that night , described seeing mr @entity1 unsteady on his feet in the nightclub			2
' @entity1 had a drink in his hand and was swaying from side to side but did not look out of control , ' he said in a written statement			2
the court heard police had received reports that a man was walking along the @entity48 at 3.15am but were unable to find anyone			0
at the start of the inquest mr @entity71 expressed concern that a police officer due to give evidence would not be attending because of long term illness			0
pc @entity196 , who responded to the 999 call , said in a written statement that he travelled the ' whole length ' of both carriageways of the by - pass in his patrol car but did not see anyone			0
but mr @entity71 said there were ' crucial questions ' the family wanted to ask the officer about whether he did in fact check the whole length of the by - pass when asked to do so by his control room			2
' he did half the journey and then did n't actually check up to the @entity38 end of the road , ' said mr @entity71			0
' that raises the question about what sort of duty of care the police have to the public			0
' family man : mr @entity1 with his brother @entity82			2
the family questioned the thoroughness of police @entity27 coroner @entity225 said the cause of death would be given as hypothermia caused by alcohol intoxication			1
' this was a young man who had been out drinking with friends and had a very good , fun evening , ' she said			0
' he had been drinking a significantly large amount of alcohol during the evening with his friends			0
' for whatever reason , he chose to depart from the plans of going back to a friend 's house and it seems more likely than not that he was trying to make his way home			0
' due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed and this was a very cold and wet night - both those two factors got the better of this young man , which led to him being found			1
' everything was done to save him and i can find no criticism of the attempts to resuscitate him			0
' the appropriate conclusion is a short - form conclusion			1
a tragic death and a short - form conclusion will be an alcohol - related death			1
' but speaking after the inquest , mr @entity1 's parents @entity81 and @entity22 questioned the coroner 's findings			1
' there are a lot of unanswered questions , ' mr @entity1 said			0
his wife added : ' i do n't believe he walked all that way			0
it 's a mother 's instinct			0
i do n't believe he walked four miles in an hour - someone has dumped him there			2
' i do n't believe it is the right verdict			0
as a mother i believe he was dumped there unconscious but no one believes me			1
' mrs @entity278 also questioned whether the man seen walking along the @entity48 by a passing motorist was in fact her son			0
' the witness was saying that he was wearing dark clothing - he did n't even see his face , ' she said			0
' he was inside the car , so he can not be sure it was @entity1			0
people do walk along the by - pass			0
' mrs @entity278 added : ' i always pray for him and pray for justice for @entity1			0
