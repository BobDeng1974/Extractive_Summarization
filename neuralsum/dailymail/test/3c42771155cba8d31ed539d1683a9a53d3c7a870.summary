it has long been considered that a lie - flat bed is the only way to get a good night 's sleep on a plane			0
but @entity5 has issued a patent for a bizarre ' upright ' sleeping support system that could mean economy passengers can sleep on long - haul flights too			1
nicknamed the ' cuddle chair , ' the somewhat comical idea could revolutionise the plane sleeping experience by eliminating the need for reclining seats at all			0
@entity5 has just filed a patent for a ' transport vehicle upright sleep support system ' known as a ' cuddle chair ' it looks like a backpack and fastens to the back of the headrest to allow passengers to lean forward and rest their face and chest on the contraption			1
according to the patent for the ' @entity29 , ' and illustrative animated video from website @entity31 , the head cushion will have a ' face relief aperture , ' which is essentially a face - front pillow with a hole for breathing			2
the chest cushion supports the passenger 's chest in a natural , forward - leaning motion , which will helpfully aid the traveller in a few precious minutes of shut - eye			0
sleeping on a plane can be quite a feat - especially for those who do n't have the money to splurge on business or first class seats			0
while some rely on a personal neck pillow , which is readily available to purchase in airports , @entity5 's patent insists that the ' cuddle chair ' is a far superior option			2
for those sitting in economy aircraft seats , the ' cuddle chair ' offers a more natural way to get some sleep the backpack will be located under the seat and straps will attach to the passenger 's head rest a ' face relief aperture , ' or a face pillow with a hole for breathing , and chest cushion provide added support the patent insists that this system is far superior to neck pillows due to sleep 's ' natural horizontal tendency ' although a patent was filed , @entity5 tells @entity75 that no further information is currently available according to the patent , the inflatable pillow is ' not a highly successful option due to the natural tendency of a sleeper to relax their muscles and fall to a more horizontal point			1
' if you 're using a neck pillow , this may be the moment that it slips and you wake up			0
however , it may be a while until we see the ' cuddle chair ' installed on @entity5 aircraft , as the aviation company tells @entity75 that it ' files many patents every year , but that does n't necessarily mean we end up pursuing them			2
' a spokesperson for @entity5 adds : ' we are n't providing any further information or comment beyond what was detailed in the patent filing			1

recent patent filing shows plans for an ' upright ' sleeping support system
*encased* in a backpack , the cushions allow the passenger to lean forward
a breathing hole in the face pillow ensures extra *customer* *comfort*
@entity5 says : ' we are n't providing any further information or comment '
