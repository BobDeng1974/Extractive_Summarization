after he played well against a severely weakened @entity2 in the @entity3 , i heard calls for @entity6 's @entity5 to be named player of the year			1
put any decent player in this @entity6 side and they 'll look good			1
he 's been excellent of course , but only in patches			0
look at the @entity2 game - there was a good half - hour period with the score still at 1 - 0 when most @entity6 players went missing - including @entity5			1
has he made @entity6 better than last season ? not really , no. and where was he at @entity22 ? and @entity23 ? he looks better than he actually is because he lines up next to a load of shirkers			1
he 's been the best @entity6 player - by far			2
but not the best player in the @entity27			0
@entity5 capped a fine performance with a late goal in @entity6 's 2 - 0 win against @entity2 the @entity32 forward smiles after seeing his inventive chip sail over the crossbar in the first half although @entity5 ( left ) has played well , any decent player would look good in this @entity6 side who else stakes a claim ? @entity41 is a joy to watch , @entity43 the same			1
maybe @entity45 's injuries will cost him votes but his brilliance can not be denied			0
the statistic freaks will be swooning over @entity50 's assists of course , so he 's in with a shout , deservedly so			2
these are the names most likely			0
but if @entity55 maintain their league position , it would be criminal to ignore their spectacular return to the top four			2
sure they 've spent a load of money , but it 's not a computer game			0
it actually needs to be put into place on the pitch and games need to be won			0
@entity50 ( right ) has contributed an abundance of assists for @entity69 so far this season @entity55 goalkeeper @entity70 has played brilliantly but has also conceded a lot of goals but the big - money signings at @entity55 have been injured for chunks of the season â€“ @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 for example			1
@entity82 's wages are sky high , but he 's not been fully fit this season			0
so those who expect big money to automatically lead to success are ignoring the facts			0
so if a @entity55 player should be given the award at the end of the season , which one is it ? @entity70 springs to mind , and he 's been brilliant of course , although we should n't forget he was in goal at @entity96 and @entity97 earlier this season			1
@entity99 brings an assured quality to the team not many players can deliver , but again injury has kept him out of action for the early part of the season so that would make it hard to give him the gong			0
@entity108 must be awarded player of the year if he leads @entity55 into the top four this season @entity108 holds off a challenge from @entity112 's @entity111 's during the @entity3 third - round victory it has to be @entity108			1
so far this season he has been asked to take on the captaincy at @entity55 , take on the captaincy with @entity117 , adapt to a new and crucial position in the team , and still deliver goals			1
he 's handled everything thrown at him			0
on top of that he has had to play a true captain 's role by helping blend youngsters into the @entity55 first team - the likes of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 will all have needed @entity108 's arm around them at some point this season			1
@entity108 has captained both @entity55 and @entity117 brilliantly well so far this season the @entity55 captain walks out on to the field at @entity137 on sunday in the @entity3 he 's had to do what a good skipper does and make the new arrivals feel welcome and comfortable			1
all of this with the pressure of leading the team back into the top four			2
no other player has been asked to do all this at their club			0
and so far @entity108 has been a success			2
@entity117 even have a 100 per cent record with him as captain			2
@entity108 has delivered far more			0
in my view , he 's the one on course for player of the year			0
the pressure that has been on @entity108 to integrate new players and youngsters means he deserves an award			1

@entity5 has been brilliant for @entity6 this season but if you put any decent player in that side they will look good
calls for @entity5 or @entity50 to get player of the year are nonsense
@entity108 has performed brilliantly under pressure so far this season
he must be given award after captaining @entity117 and @entity55
@entity108 has helped youngsters bed in and could lead @entity55 into top four
