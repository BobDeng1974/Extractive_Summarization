all that was left on the scan was a few blobs of blood floating around			2
there was no other sign of it			2
‘ my baby ended up saving my life			0
without him i may not have been here today			0
’ mrs @entity8 first discovered the swelling under her rib in september 2009			1
she went to see her gp who referred her to @entity42 in @entity43 for a scan			2
doctors told her there was a tumour growing around her womb and she needed an operation to remove it			1
mrs @entity8 , 29 , went to hospital to have the tumour removed but before the operation she had a scan which revealed that she was seven weeks pregnant and the tumour had disappeared mrs @entity8 , who has a daughter @entity54 , eight , said : ‘ i was absolutely devastated			1
my world just fell apart			0
my daughter was four years old , and i was being told that i was facing cancer			0
it was terrifying to think that i may leave her without a mum			0
’ in january 2010 she went to @entity59 to have the tumour removed , but before she was taken down for her operation , she had another scan			1
and it was then that the doctors made a remarkable discovery			2
she said : ‘ i waited as the nurse tried to locate the tumour on the scanner , and then she suddenly went out the room			0
she came back in a few minutes later with another three radiologists			0
’ the medical team then broke the news to her that the tumour had disappeared			0
she said : ‘ i could n’t take it in			0
i ’d come into hospital for an operation to remove the tumour , yet now i was being told that it had gone			1
mrs @entity8 required no further treatment for the cancer and @entity17 was born in september 2010 none the worse for his experience ‘ the doctors could n’t believe it either			1
one radiologist said he ’d never seen it before			0
the second one said he ’d seen one case , after medication , and the other said he ’d seen it once before , where pregnancy hormones had caused a tumour to disappear			1
’ they then broke the news to mrs @entity8 that she was seven weeks pregnant			2
the pregnancy hormones had caused her tumour to disappear			1
she said : ‘ i was stunned to find out i was expecting a baby - but even more stunned to hear that this baby had caused my tumour to disappear			2
it was like he had been sent from above to save my life			0
’ the doctors carried out a biopsy on the small residue that was left from the tumour and found that it was in the early stages of cancer			2
she added : ‘ we ’ve had family members who have battled with cancer and there has n’t been a happy ending			0
to me , cancer has always meant chemotherapy treatment and losing people you love			0
it never occurred to me that a tumour could literally disappear overnight			0
’ doctors at @entity59 said they had only once before seen a womb tumour be destroyed by pregnancy hormones			1
there is still no sign of the tumour returning mrs @entity8 was monitored closely during her pregnancy and she was scanned regularly in case the tumour did come back			1
her pregnancy went smoothly and her baby son @entity17 arrived in september 2010 , weighing a healthy @entity129			1

he was delivered with his right arm pointing forwards so we nicknamed him @entity138			0
‘ and he really is a @entity138 , after saving my life			0
’ so far there has been no sign of the tumour returning , and mrs @entity8 is enjoying on being a mum			1
she said : ‘ i had n’t planned another baby , but i ’m so glad i did			0
the tumour was in the early stages of cancer , so it was life - threatening			2
i ’ve never heard of a baby destroying a tumour before - but i ’m very glad that @entity17 did			1
‘ one day when he ’s old enough to understand i ’ll tell him how he saved his mummy ’s life			0
@entity54 understands what has happened and she ’s very grateful to him too			0
she dotes on her little brother			0

@entity8 went to hospital for surgery to remove a tumour from her womb - before she had the operation a scan revealed she was pregnant
she was *shocked* as she had had the contraceptive coil fitted
doctors discovered the pregnancy hormones had caused the tumour to disintegrate meaning she did not require any treatment for it
@entity17 was born completely healthy in september 2010
there is still no sign of the tumour returning
