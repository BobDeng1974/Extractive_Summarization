for years , @entity6 has been working on a way to make the old science fiction dream of turning tires into turboprops a reality			1
their @entity12 , designed for speeds of over 300 mph at altitudes as high as 36,000 feet would seat four people and is n't trying to replace commercial air travel			2
as of today , very few people have had the rare pleasure of riding in any iteration of the @entity12			2
instead , the company intends to bring their ' vertical take off & landing ( @entity35 ) fast , low - cost personal recreational or utility vehicle ' to the masses			0
basically , an eye - catching alternative to the earthbound sports car			0
jet set : to bring flying cars to a wide market , dr. @entity20 insists they must take off and land vertically , like his @entity12 , pictured here in an unmanned demo of its hovering ability now , according to a jan. 24 company statement , founder dr. @entity20 has persuaded a @entity52 firm to offer up the hefty sum to speed his vehicles ' path to the marketplace			1
the joint venture with @entity58 of @entity59 , is intended to pair the 30 years of technological experience backing @entity20 with @entity58 's affordable manufacturing capabilities overseas in @entity63 facilities			1
and the $ 80 million is just the tip of the iceberg			0
flying high : @entity6 has been working to bring a car / plane hybrid into reality for 30 years and the company 's founder 's latest attempt is the @entity12 , pictured here as an illustrated imagining of the car in flight the companies are projecting an eventual $ 480 million investment into several varieties of the car - plane hybrid			1
this includes the ' @entity80 ' vehicle , basically a flying saucer powered by high - velocity fans			0
the company 's website boasts the @entity80 ' can operate up to 10 feet above any surface : land , water , sand , snow , swamp or grasslands ... combining the capabilities of a boat , hovercraft , @entity95 , snowmobile or other off - road vehicle			0
' but do n't start shopping around for pilot gear just yet			0
production on the vehicles would n't begin until at least 2014 and the agreement between @entity20 and @entity58 is n't even yet official			2
" the formal agreement is expected to be approved by both parties within weeks ' dr. @entity20 , said in a statement			0
@entity20 expects a working test vehicle , however , by the end of 2013 .			1
