by @entity0 a teenage horsewoman who feared she would never ride again due to a severe curve in her spine has used an exercise routine to help her get back in the saddle			1
@entity6 , 16 , was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago after her riding instructors noticed she was struggling to sit up straight when she was riding and complained of excruciating back pain			1
doctors told her family she needed a major operation to save her mobility and she feared the spinal fusion surgery would shatter her dreams of riding horses again			1
@entity6 was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago and was warned by doctors she might need surgery to correct the curvature in her spine - the operation would involve placing metal rods on either side of her spine but after researching scoliosis on the internet the teenager discovered an alternative form of treatment being administered at a clinic in @entity30 in which patients undergo four weeks of intensive therapy			1
she took a course in which she was taught stretching exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding her spine and to bring her spine into a more upright position			2
now @entity6 , from @entity39 - under - @entity37 , @entity38 , is riding again and is hoping to go to university to train as a vet			1
she said : ‘ i feel like i have been re-born , it ’s incredible the results i have			0
my back looks amazing and i have my energy back			1
‘ my confidence has soared and i am so excited about getting back to riding and really focusing on getting to university in two years ’ time			1
i know i am young but i know what i want and i know that i will just need to go out and get it			0
‘ i am still very determined to continue riding even though i know it will be harder when i am living away from home			2
i have made some amazing friends and their support has been invaluable			0
in a bid to avoid surgery , @entity6 attended an exercise course at the @entity60 ( file picture )			1
this taught her exercises to strengthen the muscles in her back and core ‘ i am ecstatic that i have been able to avoid surgery , having surgery would have stopped me from being who i want to be and would have damaged my ability to ride , these exercises are easy and i have just adapted them so that they fit in with everyday life			1
‘ i want to work with horses and train as a vet and these exercises have given me options again			0
i was getting so down about everything and how i was going to do what i wanted with my life and now it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders			0
’ scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not hanging properly and back pain			1
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			0
in the @entity99 , scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000			0
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			0
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			0
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			2
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			1
source : @entity127 @entity6 ’s problems began when her family started to notice that her shoulder blade was protruding on one side			1
she had also started getting tired far quicker than normal and was complaining of aches and pains in her back			0
riding teachers had noticed her lack of energy and saw her posture on horseback was getting worse and that she was struggling to sit up straight when she was riding			1
@entity6 was sent to see her gp who diagnosed scoliosis and she was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon who said her curve was one of the worst he had seen and her only option was a ten hour operation to fuse her spine from top to bottom			1
@entity6 was worried that she would have to give up her hobbies because of her spinal deformity , lost a great deal of flexibility and her confidence deteriorated fast			2
the teenager added : ‘ @entity156 destroyed my world			0
i have always been so passionate about riding , getting up on a horse and giving absolutely everything to be out in the fields			0
‘ but when i started feeling tired and getting pain down my back , it was really hard to stay motivated			2
i struggled to keep up with all my lessons and i lost loads of confidence			0
‘ everyone around me was really worried and it was hard because i felt like i was letting everyone down and being a hassle			0
’ later @entity6 and her family researched the treatment of scoliosis and feared for the teenager ’s future at it is a progressive condition and if left untreated can lead to fatal heart and lung problems			1
current treatment for severe scoliosis usually involves surgery to insert metal rods either side of the spine , fusing it solid			1
however , the surgery is long and painful and comes with risks			0
eventually , @entity6 ’s family found an alternative treatment known as the @entity190 which is administered by scoliosis suffer @entity192			1
the exercise programme @entity194 is run by @entity192 ( pictured ) , a former scoliosis sufferer it has eased her symptoms meaning she is able to avoid surgery for now			1
the treatment reduces pain by getting the patient ’s muscles to work together to support the spine properly with the aim of preventing the curve progressing			2
@entity192 , who opened the clinic seven years ago , said : ‘ @entity6 has done extremely well and has dramatically reduced the asymmetries surrounding her shoulders and hips			1
‘ she has reduced her pain and has de-rotated her rib cage to the point where she is now able to stand straighter and her muscles are able to support her spine properly			2
since undertaking the exercise programme @entity6 says her pain has reduced and her posture has improved			1
image shows an x-ray of a person with severe scoliosis ( file picture ) ‘ @entity6 will now be under close observation to ensure she maintains the results she has achieved and will continue to exercise on a daily basis			1
’ a spokesperson for @entity226 @entity99 said : ‘ with respect to the treatment of scoliosis we always advise that patients follow the advice of a scoliosis specialist			0
‘ the scientific evidence that intensive exercise “ cures ” scoliosis is sparse and unreliable			2
‘ in mild curvatures intensive exercise can improve posture , muscle strength ( thereby supporting the spine more efficiently ) , flexibility , and appearance , but there is no long - term evidence that it will ultimately prevent progression of a curve			2
‘ it is important to remember that the scoliosis is different in individuals and that some may have only very mild curvatures that will not progress			0
‘ such individuals will therefore benefit from treatments that improve appearance – largely because of positive psychological benefits			0
‘ specialists undertake surgery only if it is essential for the long - term health of the individual , how much of the spine is fused will depend on the position and severity of the curve , and great care and consideration is taken to minimise the effect on spinal flexibility			2
‘ the dangers of surgery are overstated			0
serious complications are very rare indeed			0
‘ staying fit and active and keeping the core muscles strong is highly desirable for everyone , and especially so for people with spinal conditions , however , a life - long programme of specific exercise is a huge commitment , with no guarantee of long - term success			2

@entity6 , 16 , was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago
she was diagnosed after developing pain in her back , a lack of energy and after her riding instructors noticed she was struggling to sit up straight
doctors warned her she might need *lengthy* surgery to place metal rods on either side of her spine to fuse it in place and hold it straight
*anxious* to avoid this , she undertook an exercise programme known as the @entity190 and has now been able to return to riding
*experts* say this can help relieve the pain of condition for some time
