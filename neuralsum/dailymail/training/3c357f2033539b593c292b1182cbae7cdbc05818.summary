as i run through the official checklist of the things my ten - year - old daughter @entity3 needs for @entity5 camp , i notice a handwritten postscript added in a flourish at the bottom of the form			1
‘ @entity10 , whatever you buy , just make sure it ’s pink ! ! ! ! ’ i do my best to fulfil the remit			2
pink swimming cap ? tick			0
@entity17 hiking boots ? well , that ’s a struggle but i find some with pink laces			0
where @entity3 is concerned — to misquote @entity25 motor manufacturer @entity23 — she will have any colour … so long as it ’s pink			1
' @entity10 , whatever you buy , just make sure it 's pink ! ! ! ! ' says @entity3 , 10 , to her mother @entity29 ever since she was old enough to point an autocratic finger at her colour of choice , that little digit has always swung to the most feminine end of the palette			1
on planet @entity3 , the world is one unapologetic riot of pink , from the rose - coloured bows she clamps in her hair to her favourite strawberry ice cream			1
yet , if right - on ‘ experts ’ are to be believed , by allowing my daughter to succumb to her love of pink , i could be boxing in her ambition , damaging her prospects and condemning her to a life chained to the kitchen sink			1
only the other week , @entity51 from the @entity52 warned that having blue for a boy and pink for a girl is ‘ pernicious ’ because it leads them towards certain roles			2
in the biggest pile of @entity61 , she wrote : ‘ if we designate a particular colour to a gender , it leads us to designate all manner of other things by gender , too			0
the result is girls and boys read different kinds of books , play with different kinds of toys , study different subjects , consider different occupations , have different roles within the workplace and family , and are ultimately valued differently by society			0
’ on planet @entity3 , the world is one unapologetic riot of pink , from rose - coloured bows to strawberry ice cream clearly , she has never met my daughter — a steel - willed , focused and determined young lady , whose choice of pink is a robust and frank expression of her own ideas and identity			1
ironically , there was every likelihood @entity3 would become a tomboy — arriving as she did after three brothers			2
yet despite the prevailing toilet humour and boys - will - be - boys influences in our house , her love of pink has remained steadfast			2
this then is nature , not nurture , leaking from within to literally colour every choice she makes			0
and why should n’t it ? she ’s a girl , for goodness ’ sake			0
does giving in to her feminine instincts somehow mean she wo n’t be encouraged — as i have done with her older siblings — to aim high , work hard and set her cap at a professional career ? of course not			0
she only has to look to her mother , working as a writer and broadcaster , to see how much i believe in women having strong careers			1
nature not nurture : @entity3 's love of pink does n't stop her aiming high like her mother more girls than boys go to university			1
yet people keep insisting that pink stymies girls ' development			2
@entity131 is n’t the only one to peddle the lazy , oven - ready view that girls playing with pink dollies and boys ramming footballs into a net is somehow offensive to the evolution of the modern child			2
@entity140 has now pledged to make toys ‘ gender neutral ’ ( despite happily taking thousands of pounds from me over the years for @entity3 ’s frilly pinafores )			1
the word pink was first used to describe the colour in the late 17th century - its name comes from a pale - red flower			0
in a recent parliamentary debate , mps @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 fretted over the ‘ pinkification ’ of toys for girls , maintaining it was adding to gender inequality in science , technology , engineering and maths careers			1
yet @entity164 academic @entity163 , writing recently in the @entity162 , admits ‘ there is no research linking gendered marketing of toys and books and later occupational discrimination or sharing of household chores			0
’ so why do so many people persist in peddling such inane views ? why ca n’t little girls be left to be little girls ? we live in an age when more girls than boys go to university , when our medical schools churn out more female than male doctors			0
yet we still have these deeply misguided voices who — like forcing left - handed children to pick up pencils in their right — keep insisting that pink stymies girls ’ development			2
if @entity3 wants pink , she can have pink — in fact , i ’m proud to say , i would n’t be able to stop her , since her will and determination are unapologetic and immovable			1
if @entity3 wants pink , she can have pink , and @entity29 's proud to say she would n't be able to stop her once again modern feminism has shot itself in the foot			1
by spoiling for fights where they do n’t exist and failing to acknowledge that biology does n’t make us unequal , just different , today ’s ‘ pro-wimmin ’ lobby squashes my daughter ’s voice			0
if the blinkered anti-pink campaigners think neutralising a love of this colour is the way to greater equality and career satisfaction , they need to drop those rose - tinted glasses			0
or whatever colour they choose to wear .			0

daughter @entity3 , 10 , only wants pink things
' experts ’ say allowing girls to love pink can damage their prospects
@entity3 's choice of pink is a robust expression of her identity
love of pink does n't stop women having strong careers
