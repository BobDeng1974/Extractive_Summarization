delay : one in five 25 to 34 - year - olds had or would be postponing their wedding for more than two years , the report said			1
( file image ) young @entity6 have turned into ‘ @entity7 ’ and now routinely delay life events such as marriage and having children due to financial worries , a study found			1
one in five 25 to 34 - year - olds had or would be postponing their wedding for more than two years , the report said , while one in ten said they could never afford to marry			1
meanwhile one in seven 35 to 44 - year - olds had or would put off starting a family for at least five years , and a quarter had done so for two years because of a lack of savings and investments			1
one in 12 envisaged never being able to afford children , and a quarter of this age group believe they will never afford a house			1
the report , released by investment company @entity27 , said it showed the extent to which ‘ financial constraints are directly impacting on matters of the heart ’			0
it added : ‘ we believe the impact of this delay is seismic , not just on a personal level for those who have hit the pause button , but on a wider level			0
‘ what would be the societal and economic impact if the age that couples started families shifted to the late 30s and mid- 40s , with couples in @entity7 increasingly postponing having children ? ‘ what will be the impact on the housing market if we move to a nation of renters rather than buyers , or to a model in which people ca n’t afford to get their first foot on the ladder until middle age ? ’ more than 3,000 people aged 18 to 85 were asked if they had or would be delaying different life events – including marriage , having children , buying a house and retirement – because of money woes			1
and @entity66 , which conducted the survey , found a significant number of those aged 25 to 54 had done so – dubbing them ‘ @entity7 ’			2
nearly half of this age group admitted they would have to delay their original retirement plans due to a lack of savings			2
a third admitted they were relying on family inheritance to fund their future , while the same number believed they would have to downsize at some point to raise more money for life events			2
@entity83 , of @entity27 , said : ‘ we are reaching a crossroad			0
life ambitions that were once taken to be a given – marriage , children , buying a property or retiring – are no longer seen as achievable by a significant portion because feelings of financial security and stability are at an all - time low			2
' we believe that the @entity6 is heading for a crisis			0
@entity6 – one of the most wealthy countries in the world – now has a generation of 25 to 54 - year - olds in which only one in six is confident that what they are currently saving will be enough to cover their future plans			1
’ anxious : one in seven 35 to 44 - year - olds had or would put off starting a family for at least five years , and a quarter had done so for two years because of a lack of savings and investments			1
( file image ) she added : ‘ we have been shocked by how prevalent the “ pause effect ” is and how severely it is impacting people ’s lives			0
’ the study also found that half of women had less than £ 1,000 in savings , compared to less than a third of the male population			0
and just one in five women have savings of more than £ 20,000 , against over a third of men			0
however their problems could be partly due to spending habits			0
those in @entity130 admitted spending four times as much on holidays and three times as much on fashion and personal grooming as they did investing in pensions and savings .			0

one in ten 25 to 34 - year - olds said they could never afford to marry
one in twelve 35 to 44 - year - olds envisaged never being able to afford kids
a quarter of this age group believe they will never be able to afford a house
the *widespread* delay in different life events has created ' @entity7 '
