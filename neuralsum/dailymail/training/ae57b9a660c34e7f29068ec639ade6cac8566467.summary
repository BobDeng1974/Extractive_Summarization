by @entity0 published : 13:20 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 15 february 2013 the co-founder of @entity2 has launched a scathing attack on @entity4 for ' five years of failure ' - and claimed that @entity7 could ‘ kill them ’ at any given moment			1
former xbox engineer @entity9 - who came up with the console ’s name ( albeit spelled @entity12 ) - slammed @entity4 for failing to capitalise on innovations such as @entity14 and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device			1
the attack follows reports that @entity4 are likely to announce their @entity21 successor , codenamed @entity22 , at @entity23 in @entity24 in june this year			1
sales phenomenon : the @entity21 console has sold 76 million units since its inception in november 2005 writing on his blog ilike.code , under the title ‘ stupid , @entity12 ’ , @entity9 said : ‘ the past 5 years , and the last year in particular , have been simply painful to watch			1
' coasting on past momentum			2
failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like @entity14			1
touting strategic and market success when you ’re just experiencing your competitor ’s stumbling failure ( yes , @entity37 , @entity38 – you are , i ’m afraid , stumbling failures )			2
' a complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room			0
’ he also cited two ‘ critical problems ’ with the @entity21 , blasting @entity4 ’s membership model and the console ’s operating system			1
‘ why ca n’t i write a game for @entity12 tomorrow using $ 100 worth of tools and my existing @entity53 laptop and test it on my home @entity12 or at my friends ’ houses ? ’ he wrote			0
‘ why ca n’t i then distribute it digitally in a decent online store , give up a 30 % cut and strike it rich if it ’s a great game , like i can for @entity61 , for @entity62 , or for @entity63 ? oh , wait , i can … sort of			0
the next generation xbox console will require @entity4 's @entity14 motion sensors to be connected when playing games , according to games industry sources			1
the machine - the follow up to the hugely successful @entity21 - will also feature new - look control pads and be capable of simultaneously running apps alongside video games			1
having @entity14 as a requirement has raised eyebrows among gamers as it is still widely criticised by ' hardcore ' gamers for being a gimmick that adds little value to games			1
that 's despite @entity4 having sold 20million of the motion - sensor units			2
the new machine is codenamed @entity22			0
a source who is said to have previously revealed details on games consoles , told @entity87 he has had access to the development kits			0
‘ read some of the fine - print at the @entity12 registered developer program page ( that “ membership ” would cost you $ 10,000/year and a ton of paperwork , with @entity4 holding veto power over your game being published ) , navigate the mess through to learning about @entity99 ( also costly , paperwork and veto approval ) and you may end up learning about a carved off little hard - to - find store with a few thousand stunted games referred to as @entity104 where @entity4 has ceded their veto power ( and instead just does nothing to promote your games )			2
‘ this is where indie developers have found they can go in order to not make money on @entity12 , despite an installed base of 76m devices			2
@entity4 , you are idiotic to have ceded not just indie game developers but also a generation of loyal kids and teens to making games for other people ’s mobile devices			1
' mr @entity9 went on to call the operating system , particularly the first two levels of the @entity21 dashboard , as ‘ creaky , slow and ‘ full of s * * * ’			1
the engineer concluded with a warning to @entity4 that @entity7 , not @entity37 or @entity38 , are now their biggest competitors , given the large number of gamers migrating to mobile games on the @entity62 and @entity63			2
games console of the future ? mr @entity9 issued a warning a warning to @entity4 that @entity7 , not @entity37 or @entity38 , are now their biggest competitors , given the numbers of gamers migrating to the @entity62 and @entity63 ‘ @entity7 is already a games competitor broadly , even if @entity140 is n’t yet a game platform or a console , ' he wrote			1
' @entity7 , if it chooses to do so , will simply kill @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity12 by introducing an open 30 per cent - cut app / game ecosystem for @entity140			0
‘ i see big investments in future interactive content happening , as well as idiotic moves to limit used games or put harder content protection into place than exists in mobile or tablets – i predict massive failure and losses here			2
‘ @entity12 just needs somebody with a brain and focus to get the product in order tactically before romping forward to continue the long - term strategic promise of an @entity12 in every living room , connected to every screen			0
’ meanwhile , rumours have emerged that @entity37 's next - gen @entity164 will have a touch - screen controller			0
according to video - game website @entity168 a source is said to have confirmed that the input is on the front of the handset , and the start and select buttons have been moved as a result			0
last hurrah : the @entity175			0
@entity37 are still actively marketing the console , and are releasing it in two different colours tomorrow @entity178 : the @entity180 ' super-slim ' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware the @entity184 and @entity185 buttons have been reportedly remodelled and improved , too			0
despite next - gen rumours , @entity37 are still actively marketing the @entity144 , and are releasing the console in two different colours tomorrow			0
the new limited edition @entity189 and @entity180 ' super-slim ' units may represent one last push of their current gen hardware , given the probable announcement of the @entity144 successor on february 20 .			0
