by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 28 june 2012 updated : 16:53 est , 28 june 2012 the @entity3 's @entity2 unit says they have found a mysterious teenage boy who appears in an online video thanks to the public 's help			1
federal agents told the @entity10 that they were also able to rescue a child victim			1
last week , @entity3 released two stills from the video and say the boy - between 13 and 19 - is in a ' dangerous environment ' with several other children and at least one adult			1
today , charges of sexual assault of a child and the sexual exploitation of a child were filed against a juvenile suspect , though agents remain tight - lipped on the exact circumstances of the boy in photographs - refusing to say whether he is the victim or has victimized someone else			1
mystery : in the photos , the teen appears to be in a basement and is aged between 13 and 19			0
he is wearing a @entity36 baseball t - shirt information leading to identifying the teen was provided by an anonymous tipster that called investigators			1
special agents in @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity45 , and @entity50 — in cooperation with investigators from the @entity45 @entity44 — worked together to bring the teen into custody on june 25			0
they said they also were able to identify and rescue a child victim			2
' due to the ages of the individuals involved and the sensitive nature of this on - going investigation , no further information can be released at this time , ' @entity3 said in a statement			2
the @entity45 district attorney 's office said today that a 7 - count charge was filed today in @entity64 in the juvenile division in connection with this case			1
' the success of this investigation is another example of the important role all citizens play in protecting our children , ' said @entity45 attorney general @entity75			0
the first four counts are first - degree sexual assault of a child , the fifth count is the sexual exploitation of a child and the remaining two involve exposing genitals to a child			1
the assistant district attorney said that they will be pursuing a waiver to try the suspect in adult court			0
in the pictures released last week , the teen appears to be in a basement and aged between 13 and 19			0
he is wearing a @entity36 baseball t - shirt			1
this was one of the few leads the agency had			0
@entity3 believes that the recording was made within the last 18 months or two years , based on the design of the boy 's t - shirt			1
the logo was first marketed by the baseball team in july 2010 but appears to be faded			0
in danger : it is thought that an adult might be involved and officials expect state - level charges to be filed in connection with the case ' we have reason to believe that this person may now live , or may have lived at one time , in either @entity48 or western @entity45 , ' @entity3 spokesman @entity112 told @entity116			1
' it is entirely possible this young man is not currently in @entity48 or @entity45 , but has either a friend or relative in the area , or recently moved from one of those states , ' he said			0
in the photos , it looks like he may be talking to another person - possibly an older person - off camera			2
' we believe there 's an adult involved in all of this , ' said mr @entity112			0
it is thought that the teen is particularly at risk because he is unable to ask for help from the police			0
' if we can identify the young person involved , we suspect that we 'll be able to remove a couple of young people from a dangerous environment and also , perhaps , identify an adult			0
' it is not usual for @entity3 to issue a public appeal , but their hope that the public would be able to identify the boy and help him was rewarded			2
' issuing a public plea is an extraordinary step by @entity3 's @entity2 , warranted by our belief that there may be young people at risk without the ability to ask for law enforcement 's help , ' he said .			2

' @entity158 ' plea to find boy in online video wearing @entity36 t - shirt results in successful rescue mission
