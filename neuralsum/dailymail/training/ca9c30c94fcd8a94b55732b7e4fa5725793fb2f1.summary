by @entity0 he 's the jealous uncle who lured the king to his death before being murdered by his own henchmen in a plot of @entity6 violence			0
now @entity8 's villain @entity7 is back - and he 's prowling the vast @entity10 game reserve in @entity11			1
@entity13 photographer @entity12 , 43 , spotted the dead ringer for the @entity16 character at the 580 square mile reserve complete with a cut across his eye - albeit on the wrong side of his face			1
even so , the lion - who looks like he has been in a terrible fight - bears a distinct resemblance to @entity25 's covetous uncle from the hit film , voiced by @entity27 , who lured @entity28 beneath a stampede of wildebeest			0
' i could n't believe it , ' said mr @entity12			2
' what are the chances of a lion having a scar on its eye just like from @entity8 ? ' he was really trying to woo a lioness whilst i was there			0
he was roaring and showing his ferocity , just like @entity16 's @entity7 would			0
' dead ringer : there may be a few differences - the mane is n't as dark , and the scar is on the wrong side - but otherwise this lion is a spitting image of @entity16 villain @entity7 , with the snarling personality to match damage : it is not known how the lion in the @entity10 sustained the injuries to its face @entity57 : the @entity16 villain ( right ) overthrew @entity28 to take @entity59 as his own before being betrayed aggressive : in the @entity16 film , the lion coveted the throne and would do anything to get hold of it ... lonely : ... but in real life , the scar - faced lion seemed far more interested in calling out to find a mate			1

@entity71 with distinctive cut across its eye was spotted in the @entity10
the *animal* was caught on *camera* by @entity12
43 - year - old from @entity13 said : ' i could n't believe it - what are the chances ? '
