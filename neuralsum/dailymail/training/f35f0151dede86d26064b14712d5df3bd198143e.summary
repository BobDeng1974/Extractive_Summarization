@entity1 's hopes of claiming @entity3 's fifth goal in the romp against @entity5 have been dashed by referee @entity6			1
the @entity8 official has recorded it in his match report as an own goal and @entity12 have awarded it officially to @entity14 , who now has two for @entity3 , the same as @entity15 , who also found the net at @entity17			1
@entity1 's chipped shot - or - cross from an angle on the @entity3 right clipped @entity14 on the chest , swerved over goalkeeper @entity21 and landed in the net			1
@entity1 ( right ) crosses the ball in for @entity3 and @entity5 's @entity14 deflects it into the net despite @entity1 crossing the ball , the @entity8 referee decided that it was a @entity14 own goal @entity1 ( right ) runs with the ball during the 5 - 0 victory as @entity14 ( left ) slides in to tackle him sir @entity31 - 49 goals @entity33 - 48 own goals - 47 @entity35 - 44 @entity1 - 42 the @entity37 striker tried to claim it after the match but has discovered he will remain on 42 international goals from his 98 games			1

@entity47 was hoping it would go down to his captain and give him a boost before the trip to face @entity52 on sunday			0
' i would give it @entity1 , all day , ' smiled @entity47 , after the @entity5 game			1
' but the record wo n't play on his mind			0
he 's 29 later this month and we 'd like to think with the way he is and the footballer he is that he has a few years in him yet			0
' there are plenty of games left			0
i do n't think we should put any pressure on him to reach targets early			0
the important thing is he keeps playing well and doing a job for the team and working hard , as he did			0
@entity14 ( left ) has now scored two own goals against @entity3 , having also netted in march 2013 @entity1 celebrates after scoring the second goal on an extremely comfortable night against @entity5 @entity5 's @entity14 scored his second own goal against @entity3 on thursday evening , having already netted in the @entity3 ' 8 - 0 victory away in march 2013			1

his runs were very good			0
he 's a bit disappointed with the chip he missed , because he thought it was on , but i 'm more than happy with him			0
it was another good captain 's performance , solid throughout			0
' @entity1 did not have the same good fortune with the referee as @entity93 , three years ago			2
with @entity3 on 1,999 goals , there was much interest generated in who would score the 2,000th goal , ahead of a friendly against @entity100			2
the only goal of the game skidded off @entity93 's face and on to the head of @entity106 defender @entity105 before it flashed into the net			2
