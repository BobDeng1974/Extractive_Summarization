the sensational images show the natural phenomenon at its majestic best , with swirls of green , red and purple reaching out into the cold night sky			1

@entity6 followed information about the weather conditions in the days before he took his photographs to give himself the best chance of capturing the images braving temperatures as low as minus @entity58 - as well as bears , wolves and frostbite - @entity6 waited for several nights to take the perfect picture displays of the @entity2 occur when solar particles enter the @entity37 ’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green , yellow and blue - coloured lights the lights themselves can only be seen between september and march each year			1
they are notoriously unpredictable and can not be forecast in advance			0
@entity72 , who lives in the village of @entity74 in @entity75 , said : ‘ i love photography and i love nature			2
‘ so , for me it is an ideal situation where i live as it 's a great region surrounded by fantastic nature and i can capture moments like the @entity2 and share them with people			2
‘ photography for me is when my soul tries to reach something so beautiful that you ca n't describe it with words , but can you capture it , and then share it			2
‘ it 's never about money , it 's about this moment of beauty that i 've been lucky to witness			0
’ the 37 - year - old father - of - one is an amateur photographer and he has a normal full - time day job working as an engineer at a nearby diamond mine			1
he was brought up in the @entity74 area having moved there from @entity98 with his parents and brother 30 years ago			0
@entity6 has been taking photographs since he was a schoolboy using his @entity103 film camera			1
in 2001 he began trying to capture images of the night sky			1
he said : ‘ my heart demanded much better results than what i was achieving with its limited abilities though			0
the traditional places for optimum @entity2 viewings are the northern reaches of @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ‘ four years later , in 2005 , i bought my first amateur @entity114 , which brought me a step further to what i wanted			2
‘ i had been dreaming about a camera that would allow me take pictures of @entity2 within split seconds since the sky changes so rapidly that if you miss a moment your picture is gone			2
‘ of course no camera is supposed to work for four , five or six hours at temperatures like -50c and below , so i have to invent some tricks			2
‘ i cut a sleeve off an old fur coat , turned it inside out so that the fur is inside , and then cut holes for the lenses , tripod , viewfinder and lcd monitor			0
@entity6 has been taking photographs since he was a schoolboy using his @entity103 film camera			1
in 2001 he began trying to capture images of the night sky @entity6 travelled into @entity1 to capture the @entity2 , risking his life by equipping himself samurai sword to protect him from wolves ‘ that helps to protect the camera , and it gives a bit of extra warmth to my hands			1
‘ taking pictures of the @entity2 is a bit of a sport			0
you have to follow information about solar flashes and then possible days of the sun 's winds reaching earth			0
' on the day you also monitor any rise in this activity and then finally rush with all the equipment to the shooting area			0
‘ i do get frostbite on my face , legs and fingers while waiting for the next shot , but i am quite used to it			0
’ being alone in the @entity9 - which is closer geographically to the @entity167 than it is to the @entity7 capital @entity169 - can have its dangers and @entity6 ensures he is armed , for security			1
shooting the @entity2 is extremely difficult as the sky changes within a split second , meaning many are unable to take the perfect shot the 37 - year - old father - of - one is an amateur photographer and he has a normal full - time day job working as an engineer at a nearby diamond mine it gets so cold in the wilderness he even designed a special fur coast for his camera to protect it from the harsh conditions he said : ‘ i have always had to carry hunting knives when going on trips in case i meet any wolves			1
so far our paths have never crossed			0
‘ i am against killing animals but these days i carry a small samurai sword , called a @entity193 , which i bought on a website that specialises in @entity196 and @entity197 made weapons			0
‘ i bought the most expensive one they had and it was just like they promised , so it cuts bottles and logs			0
' the sword weighs a bit more than a kilogram , but it 's worth carrying it around as it gives me a feeling of security and confidence while i am alone in @entity9			2
‘ my family supports me in my passion and applauds my little victories , when i catch a very good shot			0
so i am a very happy man indeed			0
