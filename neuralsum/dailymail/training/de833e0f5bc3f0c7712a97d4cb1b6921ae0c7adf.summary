' principal @entity19 's decision to suspend the boys came a month after the shooting at @entity22 , which cost the lives of 26 people including 20 young children , and less than three weeks after another six - year - old boy in the state was suspended for making the same gesture			1
' it was a pair of 6 - year - olds playing with imaginary pistols , one of whom has a father who is charged by the @entity48 with using firearms in his defense			2
' three weeks ago , @entity51 was suspended from his @entity53 school after pretending to fire an imaginary gun at another student			2
@entity51 told @entity56 : ' just pointing your fingers like this and then she did the pow sound and i just went like that and then i got sent to the office again			0
' the school reversed its decision after @entity51 's parents hired an attorney and appealed			0
