it is the biggest photo ever created of the moon - and lets budding astronomers explore the lunar north pole like ever before			0
@entity4 today revealed the stunning six - and - a - half feet ( two - meters ) - per - pixel image , which covers an area equal to more than one - quarter of the @entity8			1
constructed from 10,581 pictures , the mosaic provides enough detail to see textures and subtle shading of the lunar terrain			1
use your mouse below to begin exploring the @entity18 surface @entity19 entered lunar orbit in june 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface , probe the radiation environment , investigate water and key mineral resources , and gather geological clues about the moon 's evolution			0
researchers used additional information about the moon 's topography from @entity19 's @entity32 , as well as gravity information from @entity4 's @entity34 ( @entity34 ) mission , to assemble the mosaic			1
launched in september 2011 , the grail mission , employing twin spacecraft named @entity39 , generated a gravity field map of the moon -- the highest resolution gravity field map of any celestial body			2
@entity4 used cameras aboard the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , to create the high resolution mosaic of our moon ’s north polar region			1
web viewers can zoom in and out , and pan around an area			2
constructed from 10,581 pictures , the mosaic provides enough detail to see textures and subtle shading of the lunar terrain			2
' this unique image is a tremendous resource for scientists and the public alike , ' said @entity60 , @entity19 project scientist at @entity4 's @entity61			1
' it 's the latest example of the exciting insights and data products @entity19 has been providing for nearly five years			0
' the lunar north pole in a completely zoomed out version of the image the images making up the mosaic were taken by the two @entity70 , which are part of the instrument suite known as the @entity19 ( @entity19 )			0
the cameras can record a tremendous dynamic range of lit and shadowed areas			0
' creation of this giant mosaic took four years and a huge team effort across the @entity19 project , ' said @entity80 , principal investigator for the @entity19 at @entity81 in @entity82			0
' we now have a nearly uniform map to unravel key science questions and find the best landing spots for future exploration			0
' the entire image measures 931,070 pixels square – nearly 867 billion pixels total			2
a complete printout at 300 dots per inch – considered crisp resolution for printed publications – would require a square sheet of paper wider than a professional @entity8 football field and almost as long			1
the image would cover a quarter of the @entity8 if the complete mosaic were processed as a single file , it would require approximately 3.3 terabytes of storage space			1
instead , the processed mosaic was divided into millions of small , compressed files , making it manageable for users to view and navigate around the image using a web browser .			0
