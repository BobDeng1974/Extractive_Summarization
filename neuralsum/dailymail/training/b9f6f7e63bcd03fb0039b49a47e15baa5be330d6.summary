from the glamour of the roaring ' 20s to the short skirts and @entity4 of the swinging ' 60s , @entity0 captured it all			1
now a new exhibition at @entity8 in @entity9 is to unveil previously unseen images from his - and @entity11 's - archives			1
described as ‘ a worldly @entity12 who never aged ’ , @entity0 regularly worked for @entity13 and @entity14 and made his name documenting the antics of the aristocracy , royals and @entity20 stars			2
clowning about : @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity0 writer : @entity27 , was photographed by @entity0 dressed as queen elizabeth i in 1932 but although his subjects included some of the brightest stars of the era , photographing @entity34 's youthful bohemian set , known at the time as @entity35 , became his passion			1
among them were members of the aristocratic @entity40 family , the owners of @entity42 and the stars of the new exhibition			0
curated by designer @entity46 , the works are a vivid portrait of country house parties and costume balls , and there 's even a rare glimpse of the entertainment laid on for the troops billeted at @entity8 during @entity54 one particularly charming image shows @entity56 dressed , rather incongruously , as a severe @entity28 , complete with layers of white panstick make - up			2
ms @entity56 , a long - standing friend of @entity0 and the @entity59 , was a brilliant writer and society hostess , and was given an mbe for helping create the @entity62 during the @entity63			0

by 1937 , such was his success that he was selected to photograph the wedding of the @entity87 and @entity88 in 1937 and @entity89 herself in 1939			0
his love for costumery and flair for fancy dress earned him @entity95 for @entity96 ( 1957 ) and @entity97 ( 1970 ) and @entity98 for @entity99 ( 1958 ) and the big screen adaptation of @entity96 ( 1964 )			0
but it is for his high society portraits that he is most famous , and unsurprisingly , the parties held at his @entity9 home , @entity105 , were legendary among his aristocratic friends			2
fancy dress featured heavily and his costume balls became the highlight of the @entity9 social calendar			0
one guest who was no stranger to dressing up was the countess of @entity66 , who appears in the photos sporting an elaborate costume for her role in ' @entity68 ' - a pantomime co-written by @entity0 in 1939 for the troops stationed at @entity8 during @entity54 in it , @entity0 played one of the @entity119 while the famously beautiful countess of @entity66 took the role of the @entity89			1
