it should have been the happiest day of their lives , a time for celebration and feasting on the £ 5,000 buffet spread			1
but for @entity8 and @entity9 , both 22 , their wedding day quickly turned in to a nightmare as almost the entire 120 - strong guest list were struck down with food poisoning at the reception			2
the newly - weds realised something was awry when their guests kept disappearing to the toilet , before excusing themselves and making a swift exit			1
the couple ( left ) look elated on their special day , but the smiles quickly turned to frowns ( right ) when almost their entire guest were struck down with food poisoning and had to keep dashing to the toilet the chicken , eggs and salad at the buffet spread at the reception all contained some dangerous bacteria the guests , pictured here at the wedding , later complained about upset stomachs and vomiting from the food but the couple were so busy entertaining their guests they had failed to eat any thing and did not notice the extent of the disaster until the end of the reception			1
the guests who attended the wedding in @entity46 , a village in south - eastern @entity48 complained of upset stomachs , vomiting , diarrhoea and headaches			1
recounting her ' special ' day , the devastated bride said : ' every hour there were fewer and fewer people as they disappeared into the toilets and then went home or to hospital			0
' me and @entity60 had been so busy enjoying ourselves and socialising , we had n't bothered to eat anything so we did n't notice until the end			0
' and as nobody wanted to ruin our special day they did n't tell us what the problem was until we phoned the next day and asked why everyone had left so soon			0
' then it became clear that with everyone having the same symptoms , it was food poisoning			0
@entity8 and @entity9 , both 22 , said the catering company that supplied the food had ignored them @entity60 added : ' eighty people , including a one - year - old child , were treated for food poisoning			2
' we then found out that the chicken , eggs and salads all contained some dangerous bacteria			1
' we had to throw away more than £ 5,000 worth of food that had been left over and when we contacted the catering company they ignored us and now wo n't even answer the phone			0
' what should have been the happiest day of our life turned out to be the worst for our friends and family			0
