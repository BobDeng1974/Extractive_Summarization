by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 will return from injury on wednesday with one of his senior lieutenants vowing to provide more help to prevent @entity8 ’s honeymoon period under new management coming to an abrupt halt			1
@entity11 believes @entity8 ’s experienced players let their captain down badly during the winter and wants them to take more responsibility to ensure that sunday ’s crushing defeat by @entity17 in @entity18 is not repeated on wednesday at @entity19			1
@entity2 came through a full training session on tuesday and looks sure to return to a team who crashed to their heaviest defeat in a home one - day international			1
eleventh hour : @entity8 skipper @entity2 is set to make his return from injury on wednesday preparing : @entity2 came through a full training session on tuesday ahead of the third odi against @entity17 one heavy defeat can be understood in a side rebuilding from somewhere near rock bottom but another today would set alarm bells ringing			1
the emphasis in practice was on positive cricket ahead of today ’s third match			2
‘ i do n’t think the senior players did as much as they could over the winter to take some of the pressure off @entity42 , ’ said @entity11 at his home ground			1
‘ a captain ’s job is difficult and he needs his senior men to share the burden			2
‘ we ’ve got a @entity48 in eight months so any honeymoon period is going to be very short and we have to concentrate on building some momentum			0
if we are going to lift that cup we need to start winning quickly			0
‘ it ca n’t always be the captain ’s job to discipline people , set tactics or make the bowling changes			1
it ’s everyone ’s job to be thinking about how we can improve			0
‘ when we ’ve done well in the past is when we ’ve had five or six people who can stand up in the dressing room and give feedback			0
that eases the pressure on the captain			1
’ it is a message consistent with @entity8 wanting their players to stand up for themselves rather than relying on support staff			2
back in the nets : @entity2 practising at @entity19 in order to keep sharp there was even a little glimpse of @entity8 ’s new attitude after they had a team picture taken on the @entity19 outfield — the players were told to carry their own chairs back into the new pavilion			1
an attempt to imitate the @entity81 rugby team , perhaps , who sweep their dressing room after matches			2
the role of coach @entity86 in the desire for self - sufficiency will be fascinating , because the most common complaint about his first spell in charge was that he was too ‘ full on ’ and intent on doing things his way too quickly			2
@entity11 , a big supporter of @entity86 during his first stint in charge and now , has noticed a subtle change in the former @entity100 coach ’s methods			1
‘ he ’s kind of let everyone get on with their jobs and has n’t forced too much on us at this early stage , ’ said @entity8 ’s most successful bowler			0
‘ i think he ’s going to drip feed things in as we go along			0
‘ he ’s got strong ideas on where he wants this team to go , as has @entity42 , and hopefully in the coming months you will see us playing a positive brand of cricket			0
this is n’t just about getting results , it is about playing cricket that is good to watch			0
’ there was little positive about @entity8 ’s performance at @entity119 and @entity17 will attempt to take a 2 - 1 lead in this five - match @entity122 series by concentrating on their traditional strength of spin			1
hopeful : @entity8 bowler @entity11 has called on players to take the pressure off @entity2 hard as it was to imagine in @entity131 on tuesday , @entity17 captain @entity129 expects a ‘ sub-continental ’ type pitch at @entity19 , similar to the one produced here for a one - day international in 2011			1
to that end @entity135 and possibly @entity136 , who joined the touring party on tuesday , could join @entity139 in a spin attack aimed at taking advantage of @entity8 ’s age - old weakness against slow bowling			2
yet the fact that the forecast says it will be wet here today should dash any @entity147 hopes of a dust - bowl			0
bringing back @entity2 in place of @entity150 is likely to be @entity8 ’s only change			2
one change that may be made going forward relates to @entity153 , with his @entity155 coach and now @entity8 selector @entity156 suggesting that the fast bowler will have to give up @entity158 because of knee problems			0
‘ @entity153 is a key man in @entity160 and one - day international cricket so in terms of managing his fitness i think we are going to have to look at @entity158 , ’ said @entity156			0
it follows @entity153 ’s admission earlier this month that he may have to give up the @entity158 captaincy because of his desire to prolong his @entity160 career			0
it seems now that , if @entity156 has his way , he will go one step further and give up short - form cricket altogether			0
cover : @entity158 star @entity175 was expected to get the nod if @entity2 did n't make it			1

@entity2 *'s* set to make injury return on wednesday
the captain sat out the second match of the @entity184 against @entity17
@entity11 has called on players to help take pressure off @entity2
@entity17 will attempt to take a 2 - 1 lead in five - match @entity122 series
