by @entity0 for @entity1 the nation 's students are set to launch the next stage in their angry campaign against the tertiary overhaul , as laid out in the @entity7			1
while the decision to provide support for the @entity13 mission in northern @entity14 has diverted attention , albeit briefly , from stalled budgetary measures in the @entity9 , they will shortly take centre stage again			0
with more than $ 1 billion ripped out of higher education funding , universities have been offered a sweetener , effectively giving them the opportunity to charge what they feel is a market competitive price for courses			0
@entity26 students have vowed to step up their campaign against the planned overhaul of tertiary education once upon a time			1
the @entity30 ( left ) , treasurer ( centre ) and education minister ( right ) in their younger days			2
collectively their university courses cost about $ 6000 , according to the @entity35			2
students say the planned reforms to tertiary education means just one of the courses they undertook could cost upwards of $ 100,000 in future the three men in the middle of the education brawl with university students			1
education minister @entity47 ( left ) , prime minister @entity48 ( centre ) and @entity50 ( right ) then and now			1
the marked difference between the fees when the prime minister , his treasurer and @entity47 undertook tertiary studies and what those same courses cost today			1
the @entity57 says law and medicine will top $ 100,000 , if @entity7 measures on education get through in essence , universities will need to recoup those losses by bumping up course costs by as much as 30 per cent by 2016			1
ultimately , that means the most popular courses will be driven up , pricing many out of tertiary education , according to @entity57 ( @entity35 ) president @entity69			1
' the government has made it clear that they intend to massively deregulate the higher education system and move towards a @entity13 - style system , which would inevitably lead to fee hikes , ' ms @entity69 said			2
' it 's not an exaggeration to say you wo n't get much change out of $ 100,000 for the most popular			2
' @entity57 president @entity69 ( left ) says future student protests against @entity7 measures to overhaul higher education will focus on treasurer @entity50 's time as a campaigner against increased university fees and charges she said those from lower socio - economic or disadvantaged backgrounds will find it almost impossible to ' follow their dreams '			1
' universities across the country which have the most market power , those with prestige and reputation on their side will be able to send what they charge for certain courses , through the roof , ' she said			0
the @entity57 president added that those proposing fee deregulation have short memories			0
' just stop and look at what our decision - makers paid for their degrees and what we are asked to pay now and what we will have to pay in the future , with no guarantees of a job or support after graduating			0
' the @entity35 has accused the treasurer in particular of ' hypocrisy ' , referring to the then arts and law student leading protests in 1987 against the proposed $ 250 administration fee			2
ms @entity69 said that back - flip by the one - time pro-student campaigner will be highlighted in the lead - up to the next national day of action on october 16			1
' this is a massive overhaul they are proposing			0
it 's not just the deregulation of fees , the huge cuts in funding , it 's also the impact of interest rates and changes to the @entity140 allowance , ' she said			0
education minister @entity47 took offence when protesters burned effigies during the august 20 demonstrations education minister @entity47 said tertiary students were in fact ' the big winners '			1
he said @entity7 measures would ensure that there will be 80,000 more student places by 2018			0
' they 'll benefit by more revenue for universities leading to more research and better quality teaching			0
' in return the government is asking on behalf of the taxpayers that students contribute 50 per cent of the cost of their education when they 're currently contributing 40 per cent			0
' we are asking for a 50/50 split , when currently it is 60/40 in favour of the student			0
' the education minister has been a constant target of student anger since the plans for a tertiary overhaul were announced in the @entity173 but ms @entity69 said the @entity47 has missed the point			1
' how is it right that anyone and everyone aspiring to be a lawyer or doctor , taking on those traditional degrees of law , medicine , dentistry and the like should have to pay off a debt effectively the size of a second mortgage , just to get an education ? ' ' these are people who will one day provide a vital service to the community and they 're being punished for it , twice			2
if they ca n't find a job in the legal professions , they do n't get any support from the government once they have finished studying , that 's grossly unfair			0

@entity57 says with planned caps on fees to be removed , the cost of popular courses will soar
' some will top $ 100,000 ' says @entity35 president @entity69
the campaign against an education overhaul as announced in the @entity7 will go into *over-drive* with october 16 set down as a national day of action
students say you tube video proof that , when it comes to education costs , the treasurer is a ' hypocrite '
those from lower socio - economic backgrounds ' are being priced out ' of traditionally prestige courses like law and medicine
education minister @entity47 *insists* students are ' the big winners ' from the planned reforms
