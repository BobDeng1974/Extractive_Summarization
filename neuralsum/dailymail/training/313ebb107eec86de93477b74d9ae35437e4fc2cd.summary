by @entity0 last updated at 6:00 pm on 25th october 2011 action : violinist @entity2 started legal proceedings against @entity4 after it rejected him from entering a competition for 19 to 26 years olds a musician who is suing an arts management company for placing age restrictions on a competition has officially complained about the judge handling his case - because he says he is too old			1
violinist @entity2 , 60 , launched legal action against not - for - profit @entity4 after it rejected him from entering a competition as it set the limit for musicians aged between 19 to 26			1
but in a bizarre twist , @entity2 is now opening himself up for ridicule - and being labelled a hypocrite - by describing 88 - year - old @entity20 federal judge @entity19 as ' slow - witted and unable to function '			1
he wrote in a judicial complaint , obtained by the @entity23 : ' judge @entity19 could barely see unless he put his face almost on top of a document			0
' judge @entity19 should be removed from the bench , both because of his mental and physical limitations			0
with all due respect , he may have been a very learned jurist in his day			0
' mr @entity30 admitted he sounded like a hypocrite , but added that his fight against ageism was too important to allow the judge , who wears a hearing aid , to mess up			1
he filed his complaint after judge @entity19 threw out his legal case after finding several mistakes in mr @entity30 's court papers			1
in re-filing the case , he asked for a new judge			0
mr @entity30 added : ' i know it sounds kind of like hypocrisy			2
i asked the judge to recuse himself on the grounds that he 's too old			0
is n't that ironic ? ' the musician , who lost his job with the @entity51 last year after more than 25 years , filed a suit against @entity4 in march			1
his complaint stemmed from being rejected from taking part in a competition which was only open to musicians a third of his age			0
legal action : @entity4 is a not - for - profit organisation that was holding a competition for musicians aged 19 to 26 - with the prize of $ 75,000 worth of career support and management to several winners after losing his job , he decided to take part in the competition - which offers $ 75,000 worth of career support and management to several winners			1
he was allowed to perform with 277 others in the preliminary auditions only after he threatened to sue and filed age - discrimination complaints with the @entity74 and the state @entity75			0
despite the @entity4 competition 's focus on budding musicians , director @entity77 said she allowed @entity30 to play in the first round , thinking she might recommend him to another agency			2
but she added that his performance was ' less than stellar ' judge @entity19 , who graduated from @entity84 a year before mr @entity30 was born , declined to comment on the complaint			2
but his supporters say he is as ' sharp as a tack ' , despite wearing a hearing aid and ordering lawyers to speak up as he cups a hand to his ear			0
in 2009 he stepped in mid-trial when a judge fell ill. he ripped through a 2,282 - page legal transcript in a single weekend and handled the case with aplomb , @entity20 federal court chief judge @entity93 told the @entity97 .			2

@entity30 played violin for @entity51 for 25 years
