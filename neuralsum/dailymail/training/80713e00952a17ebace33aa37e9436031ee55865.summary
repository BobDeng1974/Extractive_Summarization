by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 20:56 est , 3 january 2014 children are likely to have stronger muscles if their mothers had a higher level of vitamin d in their body during pregnancy mothers - to - be with high levels of vitamin d have stronger children , scientists have found			1
in a study of almost 700 @entity16 mothers and their children , they found that the more of the so - called sunshine vitamin a woman had in her blood during pregnancy , the stronger her child ’s grip at the age of four			1
it is thought that vitamin d has an effect on the way muscle fibres grow in the womb , helping them to work harder in later life			1
young people with strong muscles have been shown to be less susceptible to debilitating falls and fractures in old age , and have more protection against diabetes			0
@entity39 , of @entity40 , said the research published in the @entity42 and @entity43 added to evidence that showed the seeds for the diseases that plague the elderly are sown early in life			1
although vitamin d is found in oily fish and other foods , it is mostly created by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight			2
the @entity57 climate means many people struggle to make enough of it , and pregnant women are advised to take daily supplements			0
but around a third of white women and up to 90 per cent of black and @entity66 women in @entity16 have low levels during pregnancy			0
dr @entity39 and fellow researcher dr @entity69 used data from a long - running health study in @entity40 to compare the vitamin d levels of pregnant women with how tightly their children could squeeze a pressure sensor at the age of four			1
@entity57 researchers found that by the age of four , children whose mothers took vitamin d during their pregnancy had stronger grips and greater muscle mass all pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to take a daily vitamin d supplement of 10 micrograms			1
@entity84 regulates the amount of calcium in the body , which helps to keep bones and teeth strong and healthy , as well as providing a baby with enough vitamin d in their first months			0
all pregnant and breastfeeding women , particularly teenagers and young women , are at risk of vitamin d deficiency			0
the people most at risk are those who spend long periods inside without much sunlight and people of @entity66 or @entity103 descent as darker skin foes not produce as much vitamin d in response to sunlight			0
source : @entity109 they said increased strength at four was likely to have positive consequences decades later because strong children tend to grow into strong adults			1
the importance of vitamin d in pregnancy is underlined by another study that found children born to women with low levels had weaker bones as adults			2
muscles also play a role in regulating hormones , so less muscle raises the risk of diabetes			0
@entity84 is known to be essential to bone health and the government advises mothers - to - be to take ten micrograms a day			2
the research is one of a growing number of studies to credit vitamin d with benefits beyond boosting bone health			2
these include helping to ward off @entity140 , keeping the heart healthy and prostate cancer under control and preventing multiple sclerosis			0
greater muscle strength observed at four years of age in children born to mothers with higher vitamin d levels could one day help to reduce the burden of illness associated with loss of muscle mass in old age			1
all pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to take a daily vitamin d supplement ( pictured ) of 10 micrograms			0

*toddlers* whose whose mothers took vitamin d during their pregnancy had stronger grips and greater muscle mass
@entity40 researchers said links between *maternal* vitamin d and offspring muscle strength could have consequences for later health
