by @entity0 published : 00:31 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 03:51 est , 17 june 2013 a specialist military unit which is able to secure @entity3 's chemical weapons is to be reinstated by the @entity4 - two years after it was axed as part of budget cuts			1
the move will be made after @entity9 president @entity8 decided that intervention is necessary in the civil war - ravaged country , with @entity14 forces able to join @entity9 forces sent to @entity3 to try and prevent its stockpile of weapons falling into terrorist 's hands			2
the unit was cut in 2011 in a bid to save Â£ 129million a year			1
reopening : a specialist chemical weapons unit could be reopened by the @entity4 as @entity14 considers joining the @entity9 and intervening in the @entity3 conflict			1
chemical weapons have reportedly been used in the bloody civil war an @entity4 source said that the unit could be operational again before the end of september , according to @entity29			1
the source told the paper : ' the @entity4 has been engaged in a very rapid re-think of what @entity14 is able to do in @entity3 , and concluded that the lack of a capability would largely prevent active participation in a @entity9 ground incursion , or even a post-conflict offer to sort out chemical weapons sites that are vulnerable to terrorists ' looting			1
' the unit will be funded using money from other parts of the defence budget			1
two specialist @entity46 vehicles which had been put in storage after the unit was closed are reportedly already being tested and reconditioned at @entity50 in @entity51			1
the only remaining specialist chemicals unit within @entity14 forces is the @entity54 and @entity55			1
bold move : the move comes after @entity9 president @entity8 made the decision that his country should intervene in @entity3 but that unit is described as only having limited collection and analysis capabilities			2
an @entity4 spokesman told the @entity29 that resources to tackle the chemical weapons threat to the @entity14 are constantly being reviewed			2
security services see the danger that chemical weapons could fall into the hands of @entity71 fighters or extremist allies such as the @entity74 - backed @entity73 as a prime risk			2
the threat of an attack against @entity14 using chemical weapons was downgraded in 2010 , a year before the specialist unit was scrapped			2

writing for @entity29 , mr @entity79 said : this is the moment for a total ceasefire , an end to the madness			0
' it is time for the @entity9 , @entity100 , the @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity74 , @entity103 and all the players to convene an intergovernmental conference to try to halt the carnage			0
' we ca n't use @entity3 as an arena for geopolitical point - scoring or muscle - flexing , and we wo n't get a ceasefire by pressing weapons into the hands of maniacs			0
' @entity100 president @entity115 also warned against arming the rebels , saying that if it was a good idea then his country would have already done it			0
mr @entity84 has been warned that he could face defeat in @entity120 if he tries to get @entity122 ' backing to arm the rebels amid growing political opposition to the move			0
