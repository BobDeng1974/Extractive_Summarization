@entity0 was accused of being a ‘ chicken ’ tonight after leaving plans for televised leader debates in tatters by refusing to take part			1
the prime minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from @entity9 ’s main broadcasters for the tv debates unless it was changed to include the @entity12			1
mr @entity0 ’s refusal put the plans in chaos with growing doubts over whether the debates would take place , although there is still the possibility they could take place without him			2
the @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 had set - out plans that would have seen @entity38 leader mr @entity30 invited to take part in one debate also featuring @entity0 , @entity31 and @entity24			1
the @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 leaders would have then taken part in a three - way discussion , before mr @entity0 and mr @entity31 went head - to - head in a final clash			1
when asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands , mr @entity0 told @entity52 : ‘ @entity53			1
’ mr @entity31 seized on the response to accuse mr @entity0 of dodging the debates			0
‘ the prime minister should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared , ’ the @entity43 leader said			1
mr @entity30 added : ‘ looks like mr @entity0 is a chicken running scared over the tv debates			1
’ mr @entity0 is not thought to have been happy with mr @entity30 ’s inclusion in the debate , while being eager for @entity12 leader @entity64 to be added to the line - up to split the left - wing vote			1
labour leader @entity31 speaking at his first @entity67 at @entity68 , near @entity69 , today @entity12 leader @entity64 ( left ) has insisted she should be included in televised debates alongside @entity30 ( right ) the move came as @entity73 ruled commercial television and radio broadcasters should give @entity38 the same standing as conservatives , @entity43 and @entity44 in their general election coverage for the first time			1
it will mean the @entity82 party will get extra party election broadcasts and increased coverage in new bulletins			1
mr @entity31 said : ‘ it 's not for the prime minister to choose who is in the tv debates			2
‘ what 's now clear is that @entity0 is trying to find any excuse to stop these debates happening			0
the prime minister should stand on his record and stop running scared			0
‘ he wants to avoid these debates at all costs			0
‘ this is a prime minister who is running scared , trying to chicken out of these tv debates			2
‘ he should n't be doing it because he owes it to the people as do i to make sure these debates happen			0
‘ @entity0 does n't have the right to block these debates or choose who is in them			0
but it is now clear that he is trying to do anything to stop these debates happening			0
the pm should be able to stand on his record and stop running scared			0
’ mr @entity24 told the prime minister to ‘ stop making excuses ’ and warned that voters will expect him to take part			2
the deputy prime minister said : ‘ come on , @entity0			0
the broadcasters have invited us , the public expect it , just say yes and stop making excuses			0
’ mr @entity30 added : ‘ mr @entity0 's comments about the tv debates show disdain for the @entity9 public who are very keen to hear from the major political party leaders - a point that mr @entity0 was not shy of making in 2010			1
‘ this proves that the prime minister is now a chicken , running scared , and running away from having an open and honest debate			0
‘ at a time when people seem increasingly disillusioned with @entity9 politics , it seems deeply irresponsible of mr @entity0 to hide away when this is obviously the most important general election for a generation			2
‘ it 's unsurprising , given that mr @entity0 spent yesterday reiterating his support for the @entity136 , and the open border immigration policy imposed upon @entity9 by it			0

@entity95 said he would refuse to take part with only @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity38
media *regulator* @entity73 has ruled @entity38 are a ' major ' party but not @entity143
it means @entity38 will receive more tv and radio air time in run - up to may vote
