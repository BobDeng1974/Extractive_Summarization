by @entity0 follow @ @ martinkeown5 @entity1 are right to be nervous about facing @entity2 tonight			1
they need only ask @entity4 just how dangerous their opponents are			0
the way @entity2 rotate their midfield is so impressive and the key to their success			2
the players do n’t seem to have concrete positions yet they all know their roles precisely			0
it ’s typical of their incredible team ethic			0
rotation : @entity18 is @entity2 's key player but their fluid system means they can attack from anywhere danger man : @entity2 will challenge themselves to make it difficult for the seemingly unstoppage @entity1 striker their two front players are the first line of defence : they work so hard to close down the opposition defenders			1
from front to back , every player has to defend and get forward , which makes them very dangerous			0
the credit for that system has to go manager @entity38			2
i genuinely believe they could smother @entity1 in possession			0
@entity38 will surely have a plan to stop @entity43 , which is maybe why he stopped training earlier this week when a helicopter hired by @entity48 tv flew over their training ground			1
mastermind : @entity38 has built a brilliant team who even saw off world champions @entity4 to qualify team spirit : @entity2 have a style that caused trouble in their group and @entity1 will need to watch out underdogs : @entity2 wo n't be favourites against @entity1 - but neither were @entity4 who they saw off brillaintly			1

@entity38 *deserves* credit for @entity2 's dangerous and fluid system
@entity2 's frontmen are their first line of defence and work really hard
the helicopter over @entity1 's training ground could help stop @entity43
