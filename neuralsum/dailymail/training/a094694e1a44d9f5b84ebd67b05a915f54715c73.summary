job seekers : more young people are submitting video footage of themselves to employers when applying for jobs the era of drafting a short and punchy cv to catch the eye of employers may be coming to an end			1
instead , job seekers are including videos of themselves - dubbed @entity13 - as part of their applications to stand out from the crowd			1
leading companies including @entity18 are increasingly looking out for the videos , showcasing the personality of candidates , before offering interviews			1
such footage can be sent in on a memory stick , uploaded to the internet or accessed through specialist recruitment websites			1
the trend was initially driven by well - educated young , tech - savvy job seekers experimenting with innovative ways to get noticed at a time when there are some 85 applications for every graduate post			1
but 83 per cent of employers now believe cvs fail to show ‘ important qualities such as personality and confidence ’ , according to a poll by recruitment specialist @entity39 ( @entity41 )			2
almost three - quarters of firms went further and said cvs were no longer ‘ an effective tool in securing a new job ’			1
@entity47 , the executive director of general merchandise at @entity18 , said : ‘ as an employer , there ’s no doubt it can be problematic differentiating between candidates by @entity35 alone			2
the @entity53 allows you to see beyond the cv to the person behind it			0
‘ the development of the @entity53 is going to transform recruitment			0
’ the poll of 540 employers and 500 university students and recent graduates also revealed 85 per cent of young people believe their personality was just as important as their qualifications and experience when applying for jobs			2
@entity41 co-founder @entity70 said : ‘ while the technology for video applications has been in place for some time , only now are candidates taking full advantage of this option , which in turn has given recruiters a real appetite for innovative applications			0
’ statistics : almost three - quarters of firms said cvs were no longer an effective tool in securing a new job business partner @entity86 added : ‘ the @entity53 is the leading trend in recruitment for 2014 and beyond			1
it ’s set to revolutionise both the way people apply for jobs and the way recruiters shortlist applications , by embracing video as an effective solution to seeing beyond the cv			0
‘ our research confirms it can be really tricky for recruiters to differentiate between candidates ’ written applications			0
but a @entity53 gives job - seekers the ability to showcase so much more than their qualifications			1
’ however , recruitment experts said a well - written cv still remains the priority when contacting prospective employers as human resources staff usually immediately reject poorly written examples			2
earlier this year it emerged that a survey of 500 cvs had found a staggering 98 per cent with gross spelling mistakes , bad grammatical errors or poor presentation			0
@entity116 , recruitment manager at management , engineering and development consultancy @entity119 said at the time : ‘ a large percentage of the cvs that we receive have errors and it ’s the first switch - off point for us			0
spelling and grammatical errors are easily avoidable and simply show us that the candidate is lazy			0
