rising numbers of ‘ massive ’ babies born by caesarean section are driving @entity4 ’s obesity epidemic , by allowing infants to thrive that would never have survived in the past , according to a controversial expert			1
natural selection is being written out of the equation by the operation , claims dr @entity11			1
speaking to @entity12 , he said : ‘ when a mother is inactive and obese , their baby grows massive			0
the baby ca n’t get through the birth canal , and the doctor has to perform a c - section			2
‘ that allows both the mother and foetus to survive , when previously they would have died			0
’ dr @entity11 , pictured , wrote that obesity is hard - wired into babies while they are still in the womb dr @entity11 claimed that in the past both the obese mother and baby would have died ( file photograph ) his comments follow an article in the journal @entity35 , suggesting obesity is not just a matter of genetics , or eating too much and exercising too little			1
rather , it is hard - wired into the children of fat mothers while they are still in the womb			2
with girls of c - section mothers more likely to have caesareans themselves , the effect has snowballed over the generations , he said			2
‘ the evolutionary consequence is we are getting much bigger children than ever in the history of mankind			0
’ caesareans account for more than one in four @entity4 births – up from nine per cent in 1980 – with the figure continue to climb , leading to ‘ sky - rocketing ’ numbers of extremely obese people , dr @entity11 , of the @entity59 in the @entity60 said			1
dr @entity62 , spokeswoman for the @entity63 , agreed women who had a higher body mass index were more likely to have caesareans			1
and babies born by caesarean did have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity in later life , she noted			1
but while there was a ‘ complex association ’ between the two , that did not necessarily mean cause and effect existed			0
and she stressed : ‘ i do n’t know of any obstetric data that relate being inactive in pregnancy directly to growing a big baby			0
very small women who are very active can also have very big babies			0
’ she also emphasised that caesareans were carried out for a variety of reasons , and not just to deliver big babies .			0

dr @entity11 said c - sections remove the *chance* of ' natural selection '
caesarean sections now account for one in every four births in @entity4
babies born by c - sections have higher rates of cardiovascular disease
