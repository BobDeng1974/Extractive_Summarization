if you 're looking for a lakeside retreat on a budget , it 's likely you could easily pick up a villa near to @entity6 's beautiful @entity5 and still have change left for a new sofa			1
but it 's probably worth bearing in mind that in 1990 just standing on the shore for an hour would give you a radiation of dose of 600 roentgen			0
in case you were wondering , that 's more than enough to kill you			0
in 1990 standing on its shore for more than an hour would be lethal the lake , in @entity6 's south - west @entity20 region , close to the modern border with @entity29 , is located within the @entity30 , one of the country 's largest — and leakiest — nuclear facilities			1
built in the @entity34 as @entity35 moved armament production east to avoid the @entity38 invasion , @entity30 was one of the @entity6 's most important nuclear weapons factories and was off limits to foreigners for 45 years			1
it was only after president @entity43 signed a 1992 decree opening up the area that @entity47 scientists were able to gain access - and promptly declared it the planet 's most polluted area			0
in their long decades of obscurity , the nuclear engineers at @entity30 spent their time mainly having nuclear meltdowns and dumping radioactive waste into the river			1
the watered - down waste was a cocktail of radioactive elements , including long - lived fission products such as @entity60 and @entity61 – each with a half - life of approximately thirty years			2
when their facility 's existence was finally acknowledged , the @entity20 region had seen a 21 per cent increase in cancer , a 25 per cent increase in birth defects , and a 41 per cent increase in leukaemia			0
irradiated : the ruins left by an explosion of nuclear waste storage tanks at the @entity30 nuclear facility in 1957 the nearby @entity78 , on which several villages relied for water , was so contaminated that up to 65 per cent of locals were stricken with radiation sickness			1
prevented from mentioning radiation in their diagnoses , doctors treating those who had fallen ill termed the sickness ' special disease '			0
even then , these notes were classified until 1990			0
the rural communities surrounding the nuclear facility suffered greatly from their government 's nuclear arms race with the @entity95 eager to catch up with the technological development of @entity47 weapons , the @entity30 engineers did n't worry too much about safety and the facility suffered several major accidents in the @entity103 and @entity104			1
radioactive wasteland : this map shows the location of @entity5 and the surrounding @entity20 region , which is still badly contaminated by nuclear waste by the mid-fifties they decided , belatedly , to cease dumping nuclear waste into nearby lakes and rivers , instead pumping it into a row of vats			1
then in september 1957 they exploded with a force equivalent to about 85 tons of @entity120 , spewing about 70 tons of radioactive waste a mile high			1
the dust cloud spread isotopes of cesium and strontium over 9,000 square miles , affecting some 270,000 @entity35 citizens and their food supplies			2
with their waste storage system obliterated , authorities decided to direct @entity132 's constant flow of radioactive effluent into @entity5 , which lacked any surface outlets making engineers optimistic that anything dumped there would be entombed indefinitely			1
this worked okay for ten years , until a severe drought struck the whole of @entity20			0
@entity5 gradually began to dry up , exposing the radioactive sediment in its basin			2
the spread of toxic dust peppered about 900 square miles of land with @entity60 , @entity61 and a host of other unpleasant elements			0
today , huge tracts of @entity20 remain uninhabitable as a result of the river contamination , the 1957 blast and the 1967 drought			0
@entity5 's surface is now more concrete than water , but its contamination is still not contained			2
estimates suggest approximately a billion gallons of groundwater have been contaminated with 5 megacuries of radionuclides and even today , the local population still does not know the actual levels of radioisotopes in its home grown products .			0

@entity5 was a dumping ground for one of the @entity35 's biggest nuclear weapons facilities
a string of accidents and *disasters* has left the surrounding regime completely contaminated with radioactive waste
