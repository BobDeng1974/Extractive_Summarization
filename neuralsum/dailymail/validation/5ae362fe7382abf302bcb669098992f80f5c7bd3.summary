the song is straightforward and carries the usual expletive , for semi-rhyme as well as effect			0
@entity4 , cry @entity6 fans to the tune of @entity8 , is rather fast			1
that ’s the clean version			0
the frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to @entity6 ’s chances of remaining a @entity16 team			2
they have not been sounded all too often this campaign			0
but at @entity19 on tuesday night , especially during the first half , @entity4 produced a performance to warrant adulation			1
@entity4 salutes the @entity19 crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against @entity26 @entity4 threads the ball through @entity29 's legs to give the hosts the lead in the @entity33 derby it was arguably his best display in years , a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the @entity39 set - up			1
@entity4 consistently harried @entity40 and @entity41 , chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach , using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat			2
@entity48 got the headlines for his late winning goal , but it was @entity4 who set the tone			1
his goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference			0
he latched onto @entity48 ’s nodded flick and finished while making statues of the @entity26 central defenders			2
he did similar when creating a pass out @entity63 ’s hopeful ball , sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by @entity41 ’s goalline clearance			0
boy @entity68 ’s ditty rang loud			0
@entity4 beat @entity29 again shortly after but @entity41 raced back to clear the ball off the line @entity4 reacts after @entity26 keeper @entity29 almost dropped the ball over his own goal line @entity29 initially caught the shot from @entity4 but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly in all , he had three shots on target – including the badly fumbled effort by @entity29 than nearly trickled over the line – which is a significant uplift of recent matches			1
in this statistic , the sequence of his last 12 games reads : 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1			0
fantastic figures should @entity82 be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the @entity87			0
as shots on target for a @entity16 striker ? not so much			0
@entity4 failed to test the goalkeepers of @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 ( admittedly as a substitute ) , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 ( albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes ) and @entity26			1
his inability in that period to make a difference in opponents ’ penalty areas is symptomatic of @entity6 ’s wider attacking paralysis , stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent			2
@entity6 manager @entity110 ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after @entity4 's goal @entity48 sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for @entity6 it is hard as a centre - forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target			1
@entity4 would often operate on the wings under @entity123 too			2
this is not to absolve the 28 - year - old			0
as one of the club ’s senior figures his form has been disappointing , particularly since he signed a new four - year contract last september			0
born locally and graduating from @entity6 ’s youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago			2
so it has been odd to see his on - field demeanour at certain times this season , exhibiting none of the vim @entity6 fans know well			1
@entity48 celebrates his goal with @entity6 team - mates @entity145 and @entity147 @entity148 looked on in horror as @entity150 equalised for the visitors before @entity48 's winner that was back with a bang against @entity26			1
@entity110 restored @entity4 up front alongside @entity48 and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes			1
@entity4 found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable			1
each one of his four @entity16 goals has counted for something : a draw against @entity166 and wins against @entity96 and @entity168 , accompanying the @entity26 victory			0
seven extra points in total			0
@entity110 knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant			0
the @entity6 manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 @entity16 matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out			1
@entity4 on song means @entity6 should stay up .			1

@entity6 beat @entity26 2 - 1 in @entity182 on tuesday night
@entity4 scored his first league goal in 14 top flight matches
the striker put in a rejuvenated performance for @entity110 's side
@entity6 will need similar from the striker if they are to beat the drop
