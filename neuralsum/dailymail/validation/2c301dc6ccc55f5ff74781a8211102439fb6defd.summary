mrs may today published an independent review into whether the @entity46 knew what was going with undercover police officers			2

' i 'm delighted to announce today that @entity10 has been appointed to lead the inquiry			1
' while i initially said that @entity111 's further work and criminal investigations needed to conclude before the inquiry commences , it has become apparent that these pieces of work were much larger than initially envisaged			0
in the interest of learning the lessons of past failures , i have decided to establish the inquiry now while ensuring existing work is not affected			0
' undercover policing is an essential tactic in the fight against crime but to improve the public 's confidence in undercover work we must ensure there is no repeat of these failings in the future			0
