@entity1 manager @entity0 has no interest in records as he bids to maintain the champions ’ winning momentum			1
@entity1 equalled a long - standing club best as they chalked up a ninth successive win in all competitions by beating @entity9 3 - 1 on @entity10			1
their feat matches one first recorded by the club in 1910 and last achieved during their hot streak of autumn 2011 , which memorably included a 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity15			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 watches on during their 3 - 1 win over @entity9 on @entity10 @entity18 opened the scoring as he pounced on a @entity21 error and @entity22 doubled the lead with a penalty after @entity25 was fouled by former team - mate @entity26			1
@entity25 made it 3 - 0 with a well - taken third 11 minutes before half - time after @entity26 gave away possession			2
@entity1 played a more conservative game in the second half as the rain and sleet developed into a heavy blizzard			2
that gave @entity9 some encouragement and they claimed a deserved consolation three minutes from time as @entity39 missed a corner and the ball ricocheted in off @entity42			2
the victory kept @entity1 within three points of @entity45 at the top of the table but there is little time to reflect before sunday ’s game			1
@entity1 midfielder @entity18 netted an acrobatic opener after eight minutes at the @entity52 @entity22 then converted a penalty to make it 2 - 0 just five minutes later @entity25 slotted in a third from inside the area just after half an hour they now have a good chance to go one better as they host relegation battlers @entity61 in the @entity62 on sunday , but @entity0 is taking no notice of statistics			1
the @entity65 said : ' really i am not aware of the records			0
we just want to continue adding points because it will be a very close fight for the title this year and we want to keep our title			0
' @entity1 have played some superb football in recent weeks , making light of the absence of all their recognised strikers through injury			2
@entity78 did make the bench at @entity80 after recovering from a hamstring injury but was not required as @entity1 raced into a 2 - 0 lead within 13 minutes			1
@entity83 has been playing as a makeshift striker as @entity1 have suffered injury problems @entity78 could play against @entity61 after recovering from injury captain @entity87 could be set to return from injury to play on sunday @entity0 said : ' this is very rare for me			1
before 72 hours it is not good to play ( again ) but we know how it is here , in the @entity62			0
it is difficult for all the teams			0
' the important thing is not to have an advantage for any one team			0
' @entity78 could come back into contention for @entity1 , who have operated in their last two games with midfielder @entity83 as a makeshift centre - forward			1
captain @entity87 , the team ’s talismanic central defender , could also return after hamstring and calf problems but the other two injured strikers , @entity103 and @entity104 , are still out			0
@entity0 is taking nothing for granted against a @entity61 side which have shown plenty of fighting spirit of late			1
he said : ' i have watched some games that they have played and i think they are playing well			0
i watched their game against @entity119 away			0
' they are an offensive team , they play with two strikers and i think they have good players			0
if you think it is an easy game , you can have great problems			0
' so we hope we will play against @entity61 the same way we play against any other team			2

@entity1 boss @entity0 says he has no interest in records
equalled a long - standing club record ninth *straight* win against @entity9
could break their record by beating @entity61 at home on sunday
