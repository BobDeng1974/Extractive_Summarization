' it seems to me that it would be harsh , indeed , if you were sent immediately to prison when your co-accused appears to have been dealt with in a very lenient way			1
' it would have been far better if he had been committed to this court for sentence so you could have both been dealt with together , and i see no reason why that could not have been done , bearing in mind he was 18			1
' passing sentence at @entity30 , recorder @entity54 , @entity56 , said it would be ' harsh ' if @entity1 was jailed immediately when his co-accused ' appears to have been deal with in a very lenient way ' @entity1 , 21 , from @entity24 , and the teenager , both pleaded guilty to a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm			1

' it is not possible for youth defendants to be tried alone at @entity30 on these particular charges and as @entity128 , the adult defendant , pleaded guilty and did not face a @entity130 trial , there was no option but to send the youth defendant â€™s case to the @entity133			2
