higher temperatures contribute to dehydration , which increases the risk of kidney stones in those people predisposed to the condition , a new study has found			1
researchers at @entity13 examined 60,000 patients in several cities across the @entity16 , with varying climates , discovering a link between hot days and kidney stones			1
the study raises the theory that as the planet warms up climate change is taking its toll on human health			0
a new study carried out at @entity13 has found that as average temperatures rise above 10 ° c a person 's risk of developing painful kidney stones increases lead researcher and urologist , @entity31 , said : ' we found that as daily temperatures rise , there is a rapid increase in the probability of patients presenting over the next 20 days with kidney stones			1
the team analysed medical records of more than 60,000 adults and children with kidney stones between 2005 and 2011 in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 as well as weather records for each city			1
they recorded the risk of stone presentation for the full range of temperatures in each city			2
as average daily temperatures rose above 10 ° c , the risk of a person getting kidney stones increased in all cities , except @entity47			1
the delay between a person being out in the hot weather and developing stones was short , peaking within three days of exposure to high temperatures			1
' these findings point to potential public health effects associated with global climate change , ' said mr @entity31			0
' however , although 11 per cent of the @entity16 population has had kidney stones , most people have not			1
' it is likely that higher temperatures increase the risk of kidney stones in those people predisposed to stone formation			1
' higher temperatures increase the risk a person will become dehydrated , which leads to a higher concentration of calcium and other minerals in the urine , which cause stones to grow in the kidneys			1
it is a painful condition , which causes around 500,000 patients to visit emergency departments across the @entity16 each year			1
and the number of cases has increased markedly across the world in the last 10 years			0
while stones remain more common in adults , the numbers of children developing kidney stones has soared in the last 25 years			2
scientists examined the medical records of 60,000 patients , in five @entity16 cities			1
they compared the prevalence of kidney stones , pictured left on an x-ray and right after extraction from a patient , and weather patterns			1
the researchers warned global warming could be a factor behind the rising number of cases lead researcher and urologist , @entity31 , said : ' with some experts predicting that extreme temperatures will become the norm in 30 years , children will bear the brunt of climate change ' the factors causing the increase in kidney stones are currently unknown , but are thought to be influenced by changes in diet and fluid intake			1
when stones do not pass on their own , surgery is often necessary			0
the new study also found extremely low temperatures increased the risk of kidney stones in three cities - @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity48			1
kidney stones are stone - like lumps that can develop in one or both kidneys			2
when stones cause severe pain , it is known as renal colic			0
small stones may be passed out painlessly in the urine and may even go undetected			0
but it is common for a stone to block part of the urinary system , including the : the waste products in the blood can cause crystals to form , collecting inside the kidney			0
over time the crystals build up to form a hard , stone - like lump			0
it is more likely to happen if a person does not drink enough fluid			0
some medications also increase the chances of stones developing			0
kidney stones are common , affecting people aged 30 to 60 years old			2
they affect more men than women			0
while most small stones pass in the urine , larger stones may need to be broken up with x-rays or ultrasound in hospital			0
in some cases surgery is needed			0
source : @entity175 the researchers said low temperatures causes more people to stay inside in the warm , causing changes in diet and decreased exercise levels , which could increase risk of stone formation			0
they argued that the number of hot days in a year , may better predict the risk of a person suffering kidney stones , compared to the average annual temperature			1
@entity44 and @entity47 share the same annual temperature , of 17 ° c , but @entity44 has more hot days than @entity47 - as well as twice the prevalence of kidney stones			1
@entity31 added that while the five cities chosen for their study are representative of those found across the world , more research is needed to explore the current findings			0
future studies should examine how risk patterns vary in different populations , including among children , which only represented a small percentage of those analysed in the current study			2
the team 's findings have a broader context , in the patterns of global warming			2
the authors note that other scientists have reported overall global temperatures between 2000 and 2009 were higher than 82 per cent of temperatures over the last 11,300 years			2
furthermore , increases in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to raise @entity219 's average temperatures by 1 to 4.5 ° c by 2100			2
@entity31 added : ' kidney stone prevalence has already been on the rise over the last 30 years , and we can expect this trend to continue , both in greater numbers and over a broader geographic area , as daily temperatures increase			0
' with some experts predicting that extreme temperatures will become the norm in 30 years , children will bear the brunt of climate change			2
the study was published in the journal of the @entity235 .			0

a study by experts at @entity239 of @entity240 examined the medical records of 60,000 adults and children
they *focused* on five @entity16 cities - @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity247 , analysing the records as well as weather patterns in each city
the risk of kidney stones rose as average temperatures rose above 10 ° c
dehydration brought on by high temperatures leads to a higher concentration of calcium and minerals in the urine , which cause stones
painful condition causes 500,000 people to visit @entity16 hospitals each year
scientists link rise in cases to global warming , warning children will bear the brunt of the health risks associated with rising temperatures
