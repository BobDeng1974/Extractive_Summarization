for most young people , turning 30 is seen as something of a landmark in life			0
but @entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , has celebrated the milestone two years earlier , after giving birth to the child she thought she could never have and two healthy decades passing since her lifesaving kidney transplant			1
the 28 - year - old had the transplant when she was nine and is now the proud mother of five - month - old @entity15			1
@entity7 , 28 , ( right ) from @entity8 , @entity9 , had a kidney transplant aged nine and for years she worried it would affect her ability to have a child			1
she and her partner @entity20 ( left ) are now parents to a five - month - old boy called @entity15 ( centre ) @entity7 said : ' when i was growing up , i always wondered if i would be able to have a baby			1
' i had to change all my medication before my fiance , @entity27 , and i could start trying , but even then i did n't know if i would get pregnant			2
' then it happened and i was over the moon			0
i think @entity15 is our little miracle			1
he 's everything we wanted and more			0
' even before @entity7 , who works at @entity34 , was born , doctors knew she might encounter renal problems in her life as it was clear on the hospital scans that her kidneys were small			1
@entity15 was born six weeks early when she was seven - years - old , her details were added to the @entity41 and it took two years for a suitable match to become available			1
she said : ' my blood group is quite rare and that made it hard to find me a kidney			2
' when i was little , i knew kids who were having their transplants just a few weeks after dialysis			0
' for me , the wait was much , much longer			0
i do n't think i was bothered at the time because i was young and obviously i did n't know the importance of the transplant			1
' now i 'm a mum , i ca n't imagine how my own mum felt about it			2
she must have been so worried			2
' @entity7 received her donation from a young boy , who lost his life after being involved in an accident and many of his organs , including his other kidney , lungs and liver , were given to others			1
@entity7 said : ' he saved the lives of so many people , including mine			2
' i will always feel indebted to the boy			0
' but @entity7 's problems did n't end after the transplant - during the six months after the operation , she developed infections and had to go back into hospital			1
she said : ' i think my mum and dad regretted the transplant for a while because i had not been so well on my dialysis but after about six months , things settled down and it was fantastic for me to say goodbye to the regular renal treatment			2
' @entity7 with her newborn baby @entity15 , who weighed just 4lb 8oz at birth but although the procedure was successful , @entity7 was always left wondering if her condition would affect her ability to have children			1
she said : ' when i talked to my consultant at @entity93 about wanting a baby , he was very supportive			0
' he said he would have to change some of the drugs i took and that i would have to wait three months for the other medication to leave my system before i could try and get pregnant			0
' @entity20 and i were really happy			0
obviously , we had to be patient because getting the medication right was important but we were in no rush			0
three months later , after @entity7 and @entity20 had been given the green light to try for a baby , they received some wonderful news			1
@entity7 was pregnant and she says @entity20 , a 33 - year - old aircraft designer , was in complete shock at the news			1
at the 20 - week scan , special attention was paid to @entity15 's kidneys to make sure that he was alright she said : ' it was hilarious really			1
' @entity27 and i had talked about just how long it might take me to get pregnant and i 'd told him it could be a while			0
' obviously , because of my kidney transplant and all the medication i took , i thought it could take us at least a year			1
luckily , that was n't the case			0
' i got pregnant straight away and i was so thrilled			0
it was everything we wanted			0
' almost as soon as @entity7 revealed a positive pregnancy test , she was back seeing the renal team at the @entity124			2
checks were immediately carried out on her kidney function and doctors were pleased with the results			0
@entity7 and @entity20 fell pregnant almost immediately after he was born at the @entity124 , @entity15 was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit she said : ' i was looked after so very well			1
it was wonderful to have so many scans and to see the baby growing normally			0
' at the 20 - week scan , special attention was paid to @entity15 's kidneys			1
i guess everyone wanted to be sure that he was alright			0
' @entity15 was born six weeks early at the @entity124			2
he weighed a tiny 4lb 8oz and was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit			0
she said : ' having a kidney transplant could have stopped me from enjoying life but that has not been the case			1
' i 've done some wonderful things and my health issues have never got in the way			0
' when i wanted @entity15 , the team at @entity93 were only too happy to support and help me			2
' i do n't know what the future holds , no - one does , but i 'm so proud of what i have achieved and my son will know all about what i 've been through when he 's older			2
