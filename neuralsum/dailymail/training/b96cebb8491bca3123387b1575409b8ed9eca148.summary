nearly 100 lawmakers have now come out in favor of placing travel restrictions in order to decrease the odds that someone who is infected with @entity6 will be able to enter the @entity7 at least 80 members of the @entity9 and 20 senators have said they would like the president ban flights that have carrying passengers coming out of @entity13 or temporarily rescind the visas of residents of @entity6 stricken nations			1
president @entity17 said on thursday evening that he has no ' philosophical objection ' to a travel ban , but he believes ' a flat - out travel ban is not the way to go			1
' the @entity9 clarified on friday that if the president believed such a move would be in the interest of the public 's safety , ' he would n't hesitate to do that			2
also pictured is @entity42 director dr. @entity41 the president 's spokesman , @entity43 , said friday that @entity17 's remarks last night after a meeting with health officials indicate that he is willing to ' keep an open mind ' about how to address the @entity6 crisis			1
he then noted : ' at this point , if our core priority is protecting the @entity7 public , then we 're not going to put in place a travel ban			1
' @entity43 later claimed that a moratorium on travel into the @entity7 from @entity6 hot spots ' will continue to be on the table ' even though it 's not something that is ' being considered right now			1
' the @entity61 claimed that the screening measures at airports are working and the government has had a ' 100 percent success rate ' of preventing people who are showing symptoms of @entity6 from getting into the @entity7 that , @entity43 , said , is the purpose of the screenings , and by that standard the current policies and procedures have been a great success			2

' if he concluded that an all out travel ban actually would be in the best interest of protecting the health and safety of the @entity7 public , if circumstances change on the ground in a way that an all out travel ban needed to be implemented , the president would n't hesitate to do that			1
' the @entity9 's indication that the president could impose a travel ban in the future comes as a cavalcade of lawmakers , mostly @entity242 , but also some @entity243 , have demanded that @entity17 reconsider his position on the issue			1
@entity242 members of the @entity81 delegation joined the fray on thursday , sending a letter to @entity17 that urged him to use his authority to block individuals from @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 from coming to the @entity7 also on thursday , @entity137 rep. @entity137 of @entity134 announced that when @entity255 resumes its legislative session after the midterm elections , he will introduce legislation demanding @entity17 put a ban into effect			1
' now that two of our healthcare workers have contracted the virus i am putting my foot down , ' @entity137 said			0
' this legislation is a more serious approach to preventing @entity6 from further infiltrating our homeland			0
' even former @entity9 flak @entity271 said on thursday that the president and his administration ought to take it under review			0
' i think substantive actions need to be taken , and they may involve flight restrictions , they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle @entity6 , and i think those would be wise decisions to make , ' @entity271 , now a @entity278 contributor , said on the network yesterday			0
@entity271 admitted that he 's not ' an expert ' on the issue but said a more aggressive approach ' would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point			0
' @entity43 responded in depth to proponents of travel restrictions in his daily briefing on thursday			0
‘ if we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban , it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the @entity7 to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country , ' he claimed			1
' and that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that 's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the @entity7 public , ’ he added			0
@entity43 also said that allowing commercial travel to @entity13 is critical ' to making sure supplies , equipment and personnel are able to enter the region			0
as a ' practical matter ' a travel ban would make it ' harder for the international community to respond to this incident , ' he said , because airline companies do n't make flights into @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 if they ca n't take any cargo back			2
the @entity9 spokesman confirmed that president @entity17 made calls to members of @entity255 on thursday to talk about the @entity6 crisis , including @entity9 speaker @entity175 , who has endorsed the travel ban			1
he would not say whether @entity17 and any of the members discussed a travel ban , though			1
rep. @entity130 , chairman of the @entity340 's @entity339 , endorsed a travel ban at a rare recess hearing on @entity343 yesterday			2
@entity130 charged that ' screening and self - reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure ' @entity9 spokesman @entity43 was blitzed with questions about the @entity17 administration 's handling of the @entity6 crisis for the second day in a row on friday			1
the @entity17 administration official said again today that the president would not put restrictions on commercial travel from @entity13 to the @entity7 , however he left the possibility open for a future travel ban at a congressional hearing on the @entity6 crisis in @entity359 on tuesday , members ginned up their support for travel restrictions			1
at the @entity340 subcommittee @entity363 rep. @entity130 alleged that ' screening and self - reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure			0
' @entity130 , who chair 's the committee , estimated that approximately 1,000 people from @entity6 afflicted countries are arriving in the @entity7 on a weekly basis , which presents a great threat			2
at the hearing @entity42 director @entity41 declined to say whether his agency had talked about a travel ban with the @entity9			1
however , he too , suggested that he would be open to the idea			0
the @entity42 does not have the authority to restrict flights or visas , however , explained			0
' at @entity42 , our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals			0
' congressman @entity386 of @entity129 said he did n't but the @entity9 's claims that travel restrictions would make it too hard to send equipment and personnel to @entity13			2
' surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries , ' he said			0
' from terrorist watch lists to quarantines , there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety			0
why not here ? @entity386 argued that the @entity17 administration needs to rethink it 's approach to fighting @entity6 ' to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in @entity13			2
' ' this includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today			0
' the @entity9 announced on friday morning that @entity410 , a former chief of staff to two vice presidents , had been tapped to lead the administration 's response to the @entity6 crisis			1
@entity43 said this afternoon that he did not know when @entity410 would start and that he had only just accepted the job when his appointment was announced to the press .			0

that number includes members who want an *outright* travel ban and those who want the @entity7 to temporarily rescind @entity424 ' visas
president @entity17 said today that he has no ' philosophical objection ' to a travel ban - but that he does n't think it would be effective
the @entity9 says a travel ban would lead to @entity432 to find other ways to enter the country , potentially leading to more cases of @entity6
@entity17 's spokesman said today that the president is willing to ' keep an open mind , ' though , and that *option* ' will continue to be on the table '
