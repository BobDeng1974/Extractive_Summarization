migration watch @entity0 : ' these figures lay bare the legacy of the @entity5 government ' number of @entity7 living in the @entity0 has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year @entity9 added 239,000 to @entity11 ’s population last year – because immigration remained sky - high while @entity11 can no longer afford to leave the country to live abroad			1
the figure is more than a fifth higher than in 2009 and the second biggest annual total ever			0
the increase came despite @entity18 promises to curb immigration			0
the number of immigrants – 575,000 last year – has run at a similar level for the past seven years			2
soaring figures : the number of people migrating to the @entity0 increased by 20 per cent last year fewer @entity11 are emigrating because falling incomes and pensions mean hundreds of thousands have abandoned the dream of retirement or a new life in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 or the @entity35 the recession has also reduced the number of @entity11 able to take jobs elsewhere in the world			1
@entity40 fell by more than a fifth in two years after the recession began in 2008			0
the figures also showed that @entity7 and other @entity45 workers are no longer heading home because of the impact of the recession but are now coming back to @entity11 in large numbers			1
last year 71,000 people from @entity7 and other @entity45 countries came to @entity11 , up from 52,000 the year before			1
only 31,000 eastern @entity52 emigrated from @entity11 compared with 47,000 in 2009			0
the figures released yesterday by the @entity54 reignited the political row over migration			2
let down : home secretary @entity57 will be disappointed to hear that the net migration figures have jumped @entity5 accused ministers of dishonesty over the pledges to reduce the impact of immigration on the population , while the @entity65 said net migration – the numbers added to the population by migration – had begun to level off after the unprecedented mass migration of @entity5 ’s years in power			1
the new estimates mean the day when the country ’s population hits 70million , the symbolic figure which a @entity5 minister once declared would never be reached , has come even closer			2
at this rate a 70million population will be reached in 2025 – four years earlier than the officially - projected date of 2029			0
the @entity18 has introduced schemes to cut the number of work permits given to migrants from outside @entity45 and drawn up a scheme to reduce numbers of foreign students			2
immigration minister @entity87 said yesterday : ‘ in various sectors , this country has become addicted to immigration , and , like weaning anyone off an addiction , it requires time , it requires patience and perseverance			0
‘ we need a better balanced immigration system and we need lower immigration			0
we also need a better - skilled workforce			0
’ mr @entity87 said the government would not lower its targets for slashing immigration levels			2
speaking to @entity102 , he said : ‘ it ’s very important we get immigration at a sustainable level , not just for our economy but for the wider health of society			0
‘ if people have confidence in the immigration system , then some of the social stresses and strains we have seen in recent years go away			0
’ the 239,000 figure has been surpassed only once – in 2004 , the year @entity11 ’s doors were opened to workers from @entity7 and @entity45 under @entity119 rules , when net migration reached 245,000			1
sir @entity121 , of the @entity0 think - tank , said : ‘ these figures lay bare the legacy of the @entity5 government			1
’ @entity126 , associate director of the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) think tank , slammed the figures , saying : ' politicians should n't promise what they ca n't deliver , particularly on immigration			2
' before the election , conservatives and @entity134 said immigration was out of control ; afterwards , they said they would cut it dramatically			0
' today 's figures reinforce how stable immigration has been both before and after the election : the @entity54 estimate @entity144 immigration for 2010 at 455,000 , compared to 437,000 in 2009 - and broadly stable since 2006			0
' emigration has continued to fall , down over 20 per cent since 2008 , meaning that " net inward migration " , the @entity133 ' chosen target , remains high at 239,000 , a 21 per cent increase on 2009			0
' the number of @entity7 people living in the @entity0 has risen from 75,000 in 2003 to 532,000 at the end of last year , other @entity54 figures released today showed			1
net migration from the so - called @entity156 countries which are eight of the ten countries that joined the @entity119 in 2004 , - the @entity159 , @entity7 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 - rose almost eight-fold last year to 39,000 from 5,000 in 2009 , the @entity54 figures showed			1
around two in three of all @entity156 citizens who have migrated to the @entity0 have been @entity7 , the figures showed			1
the figures also showed the number of @entity7 working in the @entity0 between april and june this year reached 449,888 , up 15 per cent from january to march			1
more than four in five @entity7 aged 16 to 64 were employed , compared with just seven in 10 of the @entity0 population as a whole , during the second quarter of 2011			1
other @entity54 figures showed births to mothers born outside the @entity0 accounted for one in four of all live births in the @entity0 last year			1
@entity7 became the most common country of origin for @entity181 born mothers , while for fathers it was @entity183			2
the figures released today also showed the number of people granted settlement - known as ' indefinite leave to remain ' and requires a good knowledge of language and life in the @entity0 - reached a record 241,000 last year			1
this number included those already living in the country , as well as those applying in the last year			1
settlement is decided on a case by case basis , depending on a variety of factors including the applicant 's employment status , whether they are refugees or if they already have family living the @entity0			1
the high settlement figure was partly attributed to the number of people being allowed to stay as the backlog of asylum cases was cleared , other figures published by the @entity204 showed			2
long - term immigration was 575,000 , similar to the levels seen since 2004 , while long - term emigration fell to 336,000 from 427,000 in 2008 , estimates from the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) showed			0
study remained the most common reason for those coming to the @entity0 , with three in four of the 228,000 overseas students who come to the @entity0 to learn coming from outside the @entity119			2
but the number of people heading to the @entity0 's shores for a definite job was at its lowest in more than six years , at 110,000			1
and the amount of those leaving the @entity0 for work - related reasons was at its lowest for three years at 179,000 , the @entity54 estimates showed			2
work - related grants of settlement also reached a record last year of 84,000 , reflecting high numbers admitted for work five years earlier			0
but figures for the first half of this year showed an 8 per cent fall in the number of people being granted settlement , down to 208,000 , with falls in both the work and family categories			1
a total of 195,000 people were granted @entity11 citizenship last year , down from the record high of 204,000 in 2009 but more than double the level of a decade earlier			0
the number of people applying for asylum also fell in 2010 , but has started to rise again this year with 4,800 applications between april and june			2
this is up 9 per cent from the same quarter in 2010 , mainly due to an increase in applications from war - torn @entity183 and @entity249 , the figures showed			0
the number of people being removed or leaving the @entity0 voluntarily fell to a record low between april and june this year , the @entity204 figures showed			1
just 11,388 people were removed or left voluntarily , the lowest quarterly figure since such data became available in 2001			0
it came as an audit showed the huge costs the last government spent on asylum claims			0
@entity5 spent £ 2million every day on a shambolic asylum system which failed to remove hundreds of thousands of bogus claimants , revealed a study by the @entity0 think - tank			1
the audit showed how officials spent as much as £ 10billion processing applications as they struggled to cope with a surge in numbers			0
but only one in four of the 660,000 decisions made on asylum claims between 1997 and 2010 led to the applicant being removed .			0
