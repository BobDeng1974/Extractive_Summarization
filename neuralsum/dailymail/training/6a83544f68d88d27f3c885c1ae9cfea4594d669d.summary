by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 14:41 est , 31 july 2013 this is the moment a council street sweeper caused up to £ 10,000 of damage after crashing into a 190 - year - old @entity4 listed hotel which had survived a @entity7 bombing raid			1
the portico at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , had managed to remain unscathed since it was built in 1824			1
but it was shunted out of position by the street sweeper as it attempted to make its way through a gap between the pillar and a 4x4 car			1
@entity38 has since apologised to the hotel following the incident last thursday			1
hotel manager @entity41 , 27 , said : ' i looked at the cctv and i was amazed at what i was seeing and i did n't know whether to be angry , upset or just laugh			1
' if the sweeper would have twisted the pillar by another three inches , the full portico could have collapsed and crushed anything in its path			2
' the incident was not brought to our attention for another 40 minutes , and we had around 50 guests arriving for breakfast meetings walking under the entrance			0
it could have been catastrophic			0
' i had a phone call from a member of staff saying that the portico had been twisted , and i thought they were joking at first			0
expensive : a structural engineer has estimated it could cost between £ 5,000 and £ 10,000 to fix the damage apology : @entity38 has since apologised to the hotel following the incident last thursday historic : the @entity4 listed hotel was built in 1824 and survived a @entity7 bombing raid ' i phoned the police who cordoned off the area and i looked through the cctv to find it was a road sweeper			1
' i was angry to see that the sweeper had just driven off without any apology given at the time			2
there must have been some force and power behind the sweeper to cause the pillar to twist			2
' the @entity85 was bought by mr @entity41 's parents @entity86 and @entity88 in 2008			0
business : the parents of hotel manager @entity41 ( pictured ) bought the building in 2008 and have since ploughed £ 2m and three years ' work into restoring it they have since ploughed £ 2m and three years work into restoring the hotel			1

mr @entity41 has said with the hotel looking at months of repair work , planned weddings at the site have been put in jeopardy			2
he said : ' the entrance to the hotel is one of the main draws to it , as we recreated the luxurious @entity110 feel of the place with our investment			2
' i have weddings booked in august and now a lot of the photos and their overall day experience is now going to be spoilt by this incident			0
' the hotel has been up for a very long time and we were bombed by @entity121 on august 9 , 1915 , and it blew out all the windows , but it has taken a bit of modern technology to cause this			0
' we want to get this fixed as soon as we possibly can but we 're waiting for the report from the structural engineer first			0
the hotel is currently covered in scaffolding and it looks like a building site rather than a place to stay			0
