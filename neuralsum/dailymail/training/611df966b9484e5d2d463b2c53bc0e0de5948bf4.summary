lives are being put at risk because traffic authorities fail to show discretion towards drivers who try to ‘ do the right thing ’ by clearing a path for ‘ 999 ’ emergency vehicles , according to the @entity8			1
hard - line automated camera enforcement means that law - abiding drivers ‘ with a conscience ’ who instinctively divert into a bus - lane , move into a yellow box , or nudge forward through a red light to let an ambulance or fire - engine pass , are rewarded with a hefty fine through the letterbox			1
‘ motorists who act like saints are being treated like sinners ’ , said the @entity8			1
‘ the bottom - line is that local authorities and firms operating bus lane cameras have been making such a killing with fines that many drivers do n’t now trust enforcers to show discretion			1
that rises to one in six ( 17per cent ) in @entity59 , a new aa / @entity61 poll reveals			0
such reluctance to move threatens emergency services response times , says the @entity8			1
but it also exposes the extent to which automated traffic enforcement cameras have removed ‘ common sense and discretion ’ from the rules of the road			1
for the strict letter of the law is clear - no matter how much it pricks their conscience , drivers should only move into a bus lane , a yellow box junction or through a red light when specifically ‘ directed to do so by a police officer in uniform			1
’ otherwise they should harden their hearts , sit tight and let the emergency vehicles find their own way around them			0
the boom in cameras policing bus lanes and yellow boxes means that if they obey their conscience they will be hit with a hefty automatic penalty - charge dropping through their letter box , says the @entity8			1
the letter of the law says motorists should only pull over if directed to do so by a police officer in uniform a fear of fines means that one in six ( 13per cent ) of the 18,026 @entity8 members surveyed would not stop in a yellow box junction to allow emergency vehicles to pass , rising to nearly one in five ( 19per cent ) in @entity59			1
the capital is the only part of the @entity108 where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras though this is expected to move more widely across the country			0
many @entity108 cities fine drivers £ 60 , reduced to £ 30 if paid within 14 days , for entering a bus lane			2
in @entity59 , the penalty charge is £ 130 , halved to £ 65 for early payment			0
drivers in @entity59 face the same if they stop in a yellow - box junction			1
drivers do appear more prepared to carry out riskier manoeuvres to help emergency vehicles on their way , with nearly half ( 48per cent ) prepared to go through red lights and nearly a third ( 31per ) prepared cent to exceed the speed limit to give them clearance , even though they lay themselves open to prosecution by the police and points on their licence , as well as a fine			2
failure to stop at a red traffic light can result in a £ 100 fixed penalty plus three points , the same as for speeding			0
overall , four out of ten ( 39per cent ) say they would n’t worry about bus lanes , red lights , box junctions , speed limits , or pulling up on to the pavement if an emergency vehicle needed to get past			0
@entity8 president @entity143 said : ‘ when it comes to emergency vehicles stuck in heavy traffic , most drivers think : ‘ there but for the grace of @entity150 go we – because , the next time , that emergency vehicle could be for us ’			1
and that is why most @entity8 members and other drivers will risk the chance of a penalty charge to save a life			1
’ @entity59 is the only part of the @entity108 where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras , though this is expected to move widely across the country			0
traffic enforcers will ' seize on the chance to impose fines ' ‘ but in return too many bus lane , yellow box junction and moving traffic offence enforcers will seize the opportunity to dish out a penalty charge			2
inevitably , some drivers wo n’t take the risk and it only takes one to block and hold up an ambulance or fire engine			1
’ mr @entity143 noted : ‘ the firms and councils operating enforcement cameras say that they take into account the presence of an on - call emergency vehicle before issuing a penalty notice			1
but in reality that is too often not the case			0
’ sussex police advises on its website that motorists should ‘ stay alert to approaching emergency vehicles ’			2
it says : ‘ when you hear the sirens or see flashing lights , try to locate the vehicle and consider the route that it may take			0
take any appropriate action to let it pass , but be careful not to contravene any traffic signs or rules of the road			0
‘ it adds : ‘ remember : emergency vehicle drivers are specially trained and have exemptions to the law that you do n’t have , so you must not go through red lights or speed to allow them to pass			2
' motorists should not ‘ panic or brake suddenly ’ , mount the kerb , or pull - over on or near to a hill , bend or narrow section of the road			1
@entity215 has sought to clarify their enforcement of bus lanes			2
it notes there are ‘ a small number of reasons when it is ok to enter a bus lane			0
' principally this is ‘ when directed to do so by a police officer in uniform ’			0
other reasons it cites include : to avoid a collision or debris in the road ; to drop off or pick up a passenger ; circumstances outside the control of the driver ; or to enter or exit a driveway to a roadside property			0
it adds : ‘ in all cases it is expected that the stay in the bus lane is as brief as possible			0
’ @entity241 insists that if a driver is spotted using a bus lane to ‘ undertake a vehicle which turning right into a side road , then the council will ‘ treat each case on its merits and try to adopt a common sense approach			0
’ drivers will have 20 metres ’ ‘ discretionary ’ driving in the lane , it said : ‘ the driver of such a manoeuvre should ensure that the route back out of the bus lane is clear before undertaking			2
' in most cases the discretionary 20 metres distance will not be exceeded			0

drivers who pull over for an ambulance or fire - engine hit with hefty fines
@entity8 says motorists who are ' acting like saints are being treated like sinners '
say penalties from enforcement camera has taken ' discretion ' off roads
camera policing is netting local authorities and *private* firms ' a killing '
