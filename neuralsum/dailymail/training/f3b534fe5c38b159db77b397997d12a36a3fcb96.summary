the number of young children diagnosed with coeliac disease – where they react to gluten in food – has tripled in the last 20 years , say researchers			1
but poorer children are only half as likely to be diagnosed with the condition as those from wealthier families			0
the disease causes stomach pain and weight loss , and at its most serious can lead children to be malnourished			2
often mistaken for a food allergy or intolerance , coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by the immune system mistaking parts of the body as foreign			1
for people with coeliac disease , this attack is triggered by gluten			1
once diagnosed with the condition , sufferers are advised to eat a gluten free diet for the rest of their lives			2
as many as one in every hundred children in the @entity50 have blood markers for the disorder , which can occur at any age			0
researchers at @entity55 have found a big increase in the number of children who have been diagnosed with the disease			2
a @entity50 database of health records identified all children from birth to the age of 18 registered with general practices between 1993 and 2012			0
sufferers of coeliac disease are advised not to eat any foods with gluten			1
rates of disease rose 39 per cent in boys and doubled in girls since 1993 among the total of 2,063,421 children , 1,247 had been diagnosed with coeliac disease during this period , corresponding to around 1 new case in every 10,000 children every year			1
this case rate was similar across all four @entity50 countries , and was 53 per cent higher among girls than among boys			1
between 1993 and 2012 , diagnoses rose by 39 per cent in boys , but doubled in girls			1
while the numbers of new cases in infants and toddlers remained fairly stable , diagnoses among children older than two years almost tripled in the space of 20 years			0
they found that children from less well - off backgrounds were only half as likely to be diagnosed with the condition			0
this pattern was evident for both boys and girls , and across all ages , says a report published online in @entity101			2
the researchers said the rise in cases may be partly due to more sophisticated biopsies carried out today compared with @entity107 - initiated tests in the 1990s , as well as better awareness			0
but this does not explain the differences in diagnoses among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds , they say			0
lead researcher dr @entity114 , a public health specialist at @entity116 , @entity117 , said the ‘ most plausible explanation ’ was lower rates of diagnosis among those in deprived areas , rather than wealthier areas having a greater problem .			0

coeliac disease is autoimmune disorder triggered by foods with gluten
@entity55 research shows one new case per 10,000 every year
disease among boys up by 39 per cent , as diagnoses double in girls
