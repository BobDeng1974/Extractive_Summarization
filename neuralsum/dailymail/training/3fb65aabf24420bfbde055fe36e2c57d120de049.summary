the cover photo for @entity2 ’s first match programme of the new gaal - actico era tried to capture the mood with one simple image : a picture of @entity8 ’s no 7 shirt hanging in the @entity10 dressing - room alongside that of @entity13 ’s no 9			1
two superstars who alone could end up costing in excess of £ 110million			2
on the next peg you could only just about make out @entity19 ’s jersey			2
and if you did n’t know the identity of the other new signing making his home debut yesterday , it was practically impossible to read the blurred name and number on the back of the fourth shirt			2
when @entity31 was unveiled next to @entity13 at a press conference last thursday afternoon , he might as well not have been there			1
a couple of polite questions were put to the baby - faced @entity36 with the mop of blond hair , but the spotlight was inevitably fixed on the @entity42 striker			1
@entity31 battles with @entity44 ' @entity43 in the midfield at @entity10 on sunday @entity36 midfielder @entity31 wins the ball off @entity47 in a way that was typical of his afternoon there was little change yesterday			1
@entity51 deservedly stole the show with his match - winning contribution , and the biggest ovation of the day was reserved for @entity13 ’s introduction in the second half			1
@entity31 , meanwhile , eased seamlessly and selflessly into his new surroundings at the other end of the pitch			1
patrolling the area in front of @entity2 ’s experimental defence , he sniffed out and then snuffed out any trouble he could detect on the rare occasions @entity44 threatened			1
it was if he had been there for years			2
this is a job he perfected at @entity68 and is the reason @entity70 paid £ 14million to take the son of his old captain and right - hand man @entity73 with him to @entity10			2
@entity31 was able to disrupt @entity44 whenever they came forward but also showed his passing ability while @entity8 may have dominated the game offensively , behind him @entity31 was always there to @entity70 , @entity77 is the epitome of an @entity68 player : an intelligent , disciplined , and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach ’s instructions to the letter			1
they do n’t make you @entity87 — an award blind accepted at the start of this month — for any old reason			2
‘ i have worked with @entity31 in the @entity94 national squad , so he is no stranger to me , ’ wrote @entity70 in his programme notes yesterday			1
‘ he is a very intelligent player and a great reader of the game			0
he has the versatility to play in many positions which is a great asset to have and gives me many options for him			0
’ @entity70 played @entity77 primarily as a left - back for @entity94 at the @entity101 , and it was the 24 - year - old ’s arrowing through ball that picked out @entity104 for his spectacular diving header against @entity106			0
he also weighed in with a goal in the third - place play - off against hosts @entity108			0
going forward there will be tougher tests for @entity31 and his teammates , but it was a good start @entity2 's new holding midfielder makes yet another tackle to win the ball from @entity118 but @entity31 prefers the midfield holding role and that is where the manager hopes to utilise him most at @entity2 — a defensive anchor to the fearsome offensive line - up he has assembled at @entity10			1
that is not to say that @entity77 will not have licence to get forward			0
it was his 25 - yard effort yesterday that led to the parry from @entity131 and loose ball that @entity13 could — and perhaps should — have turned into his first goal for @entity2			1
but not every game will be a comfortable four - goal canter against weak opposition , and @entity31 knows that his job going forward will be to screen his defence , break up play and get the ball rolling for @entity2 ’s high - octane attack			1
he is a lot more than ‘ a water carrier ’ , as @entity142 once dismissively described @entity143			0
observers in @entity94 talk about his almost metronomic passing and an ability to set the tempo of a game			0
it was hard to remember him misplacing a pass yesterday			0
it was not just a defensive display , @entity31 's shot forcing @entity131 to spill the ball to @entity13 @entity13 was given all of the attention before the game , but he could n't take his chance when it came afterwards @entity31 could not have been more satisfied with his debut			1
‘ i was really excited before the game , ’ he said			0
‘ it was a really good debut and everything has gone well			0
i felt at home straight away			0
‘ it is a new team and it can be difficult at first but i think we did well			2
everybody is feeling good and everyone helped each other when we lost the ball			0
‘ it ’s important that we do that as quickly as possible when we lose it — that is the manager ’s philosophy			0
we did a good job as a team and this is a new beginning			2
’ when @entity2 fans wake up this morning , @entity51 will be the name on the lips			0
the prospect of him teaming up with @entity13 is mouthwatering indeed			1
but in his own way , @entity77 could prove to be an equally important addition to the new order at @entity10 .			0

@entity36 midfielder given little attention but puts in superb display
@entity31 looked like he *'d* been in the team for years
@entity8 stole the show but holding man broke up any @entity44 attacks
@entity31 also had the shot which *provided* @entity13 his best chance
