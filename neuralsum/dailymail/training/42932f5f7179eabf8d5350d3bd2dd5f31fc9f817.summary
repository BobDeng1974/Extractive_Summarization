insisting that @entity1 was an all - american company , mr @entity0 brushed off criticism from a @entity17 panel , saying : ‘ we estimate that the @entity19 has developed over 300,000 jobs in the @entity22 none of that activity was there five years ago			1
’ he said the ‘ design and development ’ of @entity1 products remains focused on the @entity22 and blasted @entity22 ’s tax laws for not keeping pace with ‘ the digital age			1
the probe discovered that @entity1 employs a group of affiliate companies outside @entity22 to avoid paying tax			1
one @entity1 satellite in @entity53 earned $ 22 billion in 2011 – but reportedly paid just $ 10 million in taxes			1
@entity1 ’s arrangement has allowed it to pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $ 37 billion in overseas profits in 2012 , despite the fact that the average tax rate for countries in its main markets was 24 per cent last year , says the report			1
‘ @entity1 was n’t satisfied with shifting its profits to a low - tax offshore tax haven , ’ said subcommittee member senator @entity39			1
‘ @entity1 sought the @entity65 of tax avoidance			1
it has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars , while claiming to be tax resident nowhere			0

‘ this is going to be an @entity1 - bashing day , ’ he added			0
@entity1 uses five companies located in @entity53 to carry out its tax strategy , says the report			1
the companies are located at the same address in @entity103 and they share members of their boards of directors			2
while all five companies were incorporated in @entity53 , only two of them also have tax residency in that country			2
that means the other three are n’t legally required to pay taxes in @entity53 because they are n’t managed or controlled in that country , in @entity1 ’s view			1
sworn in to testify : @entity1 ceo @entity0 testifies over the offshore profit shifting and the @entity22 tax code , on @entity14 media attention : @entity1 ceo @entity0 arrives on @entity14 , in @entity32 , and is swarmed by photographers and journalists @entity1 says it complies with the law and pays ‘ an extraordinary amount ’ of tax			1
‘ @entity1 does not use tax gimmicks , ’ the company said in a statement			2
‘ and @entity1 pays all its required taxes , both in this country and abroad , ’ it added			0
the spotlight on @entity1 ’s tax strategy comes at a time of growing concern in @entity134 and @entity32 over the amount of revenue lost because of money stashed offshore			0
search giant @entity142 , online retailer @entity140 and coffee chain @entity139 have all come under criticism for arranging their affairs in a way that leaves them liable to low rates of tax on billions of pounds of overseas sales			0
@entity150 has used ‘ aggressive ’ transactions to shift assets to subsidiaries in @entity154 , @entity53 and @entity155 , in part to avoid taxes			2
@entity158 has used complex offshore loan transactions worth billions while using the money to run its @entity22 operations , according to the panel			0
the subcommittee ’s report estimates that @entity1 avoided at least $ 3.5 billion in @entity22 taxes in 2011 and $ 9 billion in 2012 by using the tactic			1

@entity22 firms invested $ 30 billion in @entity53 last year , more than in @entity173 and the rest of emerging @entity175 combined , according to the @entity176			1
getting a grilling : @entity0 got aggressive as he testified over @entity1 's tax ethics and offshore subsidiaries meanwhile , @entity53 deputy prime minister @entity180 yesterday said it was not to blame for @entity1 's low global tax payments and said they had no special rate with the company			1
the @entity53 government , which has seen the luring of @entity22 multinationals with low taxes as a key part of its economic policy since the 1960s , said its system was transparent and other countries were responsible if the tax rate paid by @entity1 was too low			1
he told national broadcaster @entity197 : ' they are issues that arise from the taxation systems in other jurisdictions , and that is an issue that has to be addressed first of all in those jurisdictions			0
' the @entity17 subcommittee identified three subsidiaries that have no tax residency either in @entity53 , where they are incorporated , or in the @entity22 , where those companies are managed			1
the main subsidiary , a holding company that includes @entity1 's retail stores throughout @entity213 , has not paid any corporate income tax in the last five years , the report said			2

@entity17 investigation found @entity1 uses affiliate companies in @entity53 ( pictured ) to avoid billions in @entity22 income tax horses graze over the road from the @entity53 @entity1 headquarters on the edge of @entity103 the report says @entity1 capitalizes on a difference between @entity22 and @entity53 rules regarding tax residency			1
in @entity53 , a company must be managed and controlled in the country to be a tax resident			2
under @entity22 law , a company is a tax resident of the country in which it was established			2
therefore , the @entity1 companies are not tax residents of @entity53 nor of the @entity22 , since they were not incorporated in the @entity22 the strategies @entity1 uses are legal , and many other multinational corporations use similar tax techniques to avoid paying @entity22 income taxes on profits they reap overseas			1
however , the tactics have raised questions about loopholes in the @entity22 tax code , lawmakers say			1
the spotlight on @entity1 's tax strategy comes at a time of fevered debate in @entity32 over whether and how to raise revenues to help reduce the federal deficit			2

however , @entity1 has been lobbying to change @entity22 law so it can erase its tax liabilities in a less conspicuous fashion			1
in its second quarter ended march 31 , @entity1 posted its first profit decline in ten years			0
net income was $ 9.5billion , or $ 10.09 a share , down 18 per cent from $ 11.6billion , or $ 12.30 a share , in the same period a year ago			0

in the @entity302 , @entity142 was accused of doing evil ' by a parliamentary committee after mps claimed the internet giant by using ' devious , calculated and unethical ' trucks to minimize its liabilities			0
it paid just $ 11 million in corporation tax last year despite having a @entity302 turnover of $ 4.5 billion			0
elsewhere , @entity140 could be investigated by the @entity302 @entity317 after paying just $ 3.7 million in corporation tax on @entity302 sales of $ 485 million last year			0
but the @entity321 - based group told its investors that it actually made 13 times this amount , claiming the @entity302 sales were actually more than $ 6 billion			0
@entity139 was one of the first companies to be accused of tax avoidance when the row erupted last year			1
it has since agreed to pay $ 30 million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009			0
@entity334 has also said it will fight tax avoidance and president @entity336 has called for the ' eradication ' of tax havens			2
