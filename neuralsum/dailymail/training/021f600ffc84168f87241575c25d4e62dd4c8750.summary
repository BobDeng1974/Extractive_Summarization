@entity0 insists @entity1 will recover after being outclassed by @entity2 in a disturbing start to their @entity5 group campaign			1
@entity6 and @entity7 struck in a 2 - 0 victory for the @entity10 club , but the winning margin should have been a landslide after the @entity13 were overwhelmed at @entity14			1
it was clearly their toughest fixture in @entity17 but the dismal performance has raised concerns over their ability to make any meaningful impact in @entity22 this season			2
@entity1 midfielder @entity0 shows his frustration during the @entity13 defeat to @entity2 the @entity1 midfielder looks to get the better of @entity7 during the game on tuesday adding to the despondency is the ankle injury that forced @entity0 off in the closing stages			1
@entity31 played down the severity of the sprain , but a more informed assessment is expected ahead of saturday 's @entity36 trip to @entity37			0
' we 'll bounce back			0
our next @entity5 game ( against @entity40 on october 1 ) is at home and hopefully we 'll get the three points , ' @entity0 told the @entity43			1
' it 's never nice to lose a game - we wanted to come here and win - but that was our first @entity5 group game			1
' we have got five more so we have an opportunity to try and get 15 points and that is what we 'll try to do			0
' it has n't quite clicked for us yet but we 've got a lot of quality players and i 'm sure it 'll come right			0
' @entity1 's shortcomings have left @entity31 open to criticism on multiple fronts and the @entity59 faces some tough decisions			2
@entity2 ran amok in midfield , exposing club captain @entity63 's inability to shield the defence against bright opponents who think and act quickly			1
once again @entity66 drifted anonymously around the pitch , playing a couple of sublime passes but otherwise contributing little and his substitution on the hour mark was barely noticed			0
@entity73 races past @entity74 during the @entity5 encounter but to no avail @entity31 will hope to have full - backs @entity77 and @entity79 available for @entity37 after they missed out against @entity2 through injury and illness , but problems persist in defence			1
misfortune has robbed @entity1 of @entity85 for two to three months - the @entity59 has ankle ligament damage - but @entity87 and @entity88 were poor at @entity14			1
@entity31 's refusal to add quality defensive cover other than @entity91 and @entity85 over the summer has now returned to haunt him , placing his transfer policy under renewed scrutiny			0
and the manager must hope striker @entity73 begins hitting the target as soon as possible after his second outing for @entity1 was against notable for wasted opportunities			2
' it was disappointing against @entity2			2
they are a good team and we have got to be a bit smarter when we come to places like this , ' @entity0 said			2
' with their gameplan , they wanted to press us high up the pitch and we let them do it in the first half			0
' we started the second half quite brightly in the first couple of minutes and then unfortunately it was the same thing again on the counter attack and then the game is over			0
' we knew what they were going to do			0
we should have played maybe a little bit longer in the first half than trying to play our football in our half of the pitch because once you lose it there , they are straight onto us			0
' we had a few chances and even at 2 - 0 , @entity73 had a chance and if he had scored that maybe the last 10 minutes would have been a different game			1

the @entity1 midfielder is *confident* his side will recover from being outclassed in their opening @entity5
@entity2 ran out *convincing* 2 - 0 winners at the @entity14
@entity0 *maintains* there are five games to go to make up for the defeat and get through to the last *16* of the @entity5
