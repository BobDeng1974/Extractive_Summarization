@entity0 believes golf ’s persistent slow play ‘ cheats ’ should be banned from tournaments – even if it means missing a major			1
the @entity5 pounced on @entity7 ’s recent plea for the game to be speeded up , recommending automatic one - shot penalties for anyone going over the clock			1
' everything 's so instant now and everyone does n't have as much time as they used to , ' the world no 1 told the @entity18			1
' so you maybe try some way of speeding the game up			1
' and @entity0 believes the game should follow the lead of cricket , pointing to @entity27 captain @entity26 ’s recent one - game suspension for his team ’s slow over rate as an example			1
@entity0 ( right ) has backed @entity31 team - mate @entity7 's ( left ) call to speed up golf @entity0 believes the game should follow the lead of cricket in tackling slow play ‘ i think certain forms of slow play is cheating , ’ said the @entity0			1
‘ i think guys who are slow , who know they are slow and get fined all the time but do n’t do anything about it are putting people off			1
they are certainly putting viewers off			2
the bit i think is cheating is they ’ve got two paces , speeding up once they ’ve been put on the clock			2
‘ we are on at the kids in our foundation all the time to speed up			1
apparently all the committee guys say every week that ’s what they talk about - but nothing happens			2
‘ i think on the pro tour you have to make it ruthless and say that ’s it a shot penalty			2
you ca n’t have a monetary thing			2
‘ in cricket , if he does n’t meet his over rate he ’s out			1
two - shot penalties and you are suspended the next week - and it might be @entity65			1
@entity0 and @entity7 both say it is time to address the issue of pace of play in golf the @entity5 has enjoyed his best year as a professional , which included winning the @entity31 at @entity74 ‘ guys are never ready			1
the guy who plays third can slow everything up			1
by the time he gets to play , he ’s not even got his glove on yet			1
as you get older you learn			2
i go out with my mates and go round in two and a half hours			0
we are always ready , with the glove out			0
‘ @entity84 playing third still have to get the glove on and get the yardage book out and you think : “ are you kidding ? ” look at putting			0
everybody looks at the putt from one side but the third guy has n’t looked , and he ends up looking at it from four different sides			0
’ @entity0 , aware that often some of the worst offenders are young players fresh to the professional ranks , believes the key lies in education – and reviving the old ‘ @entity100 week ’ , named after an equipment manufacturer , that the @entity98 used to run for rookies			1
‘ you need an @entity100 week , ’ he said , adding : ‘ get some @entity102 pros in to show them what to do			0
not many of us have bad times , the older generation			0
‘ you ’ll p * * * someone off			0
it has to be a uniformed approach			0
you go to the @entity110 and you only have three referees			0
how do you police that ? the players have to do it themselves			2
‘ when i was first came on tour we had @entity100 weeks			0
the new guys need something like that just to reiterate what happens on tour			0
they have to know what goes on			0
we had media training , we had tv training , you met the travel guys			0
it was like a big boot camp for a week and it was all laid out			0
that ’s the way forward			0
