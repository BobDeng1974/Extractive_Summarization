the ' @entity6 ' @entity5 , 39 , and thief @entity7 , 27 , escaped from @entity8 , a category d prison in @entity9 , @entity10 , on monday night			1

today , the government responded to the latest escape by ruling that prisoners with a history of escaping will no longer be placed in open prisons			1
it is the latest in a series of escapes that has heaped embarrassment on ministers and prompted critics to brand the prison service ‘ beyond a joke ’			2
@entity5 , 39 , originally from @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity7 , 27 , from @entity16 , failed to return to the open prison @entity48 in @entity9 , @entity10 , on monday evening			1
officers warned they may have been attempting to make their way back to the areas they originate from as they do not have any known connections in the @entity10 region			0
@entity5 was serving an indeterminate sentence , since 2007 , for a knifepoint robbery and @entity7 was on remand awaiting a sentence for a theft related matter			1
it came just the day after a murderer who absconded from an open prison was arrested after going on the run for the fourth time			1
back in custody : it comes the day after @entity70 ( left ) , a convicted murderer , was found , hours after robber @entity68 ( right ) was also recaptured in @entity71 armed robber @entity72 , @entity73 the @entity74 , went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison @entity70 , 44 , who stabbed a blind man to death , was held for being unlawfully at large at an address in @entity80			1
the killer was recaptured by @entity82 after failing to return to jail on saturday afternoon			0
the day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training			2
but it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed , dangeours criminals			0
the government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers , druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year			0
last july , @entity101 ( pictured above ) was convicted of murdering @entity102 in the village of @entity104 , @entity105 , while on day release			0
murderer @entity106 carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010			0
and @entity110 , a drug dealer , spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £ 14million cocaine deal			2
last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons , which have minimal supervision			0
@entity68 , a violent thief and fellow inmate with @entity119 tattoos who was also on temporary licence , also absconded on the same day from the same prison			1
@entity68 was arrested and is also being held in custody			0
their escape comes a fortnight after @entity30 absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society before being caught four days later			1
it came after mps attacked the ' absolute scandal ' of murderers being allowed out of prison ' willy nilly '			0
in 1991 , a judge said @entity70 appointed himself as an ‘ executioner ’ when he decided to kill 53 - year - old @entity136 , who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile			0
he was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on saturday			0
his three previous escapes have been from @entity140 in @entity141 and open prisons in @entity143 and @entity144			0
@entity70 , 44 , and @entity68 , 51 , had been allowed out from @entity145 – an open category c prison in @entity147 , @entity148 – at 9.30am on saturday			2
they failed to return as agreed at 4.30pm			0
@entity68 , who has swastika tattoos on his arms , was jailed for seven years in 2006 for a two - month spree of ‘ professionally executed robberies ’			0
he threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off - licences in @entity71			0
he was caught after an employee slipped an explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash			0
an urgent review is currently taking place into why @entity30 was allowed temporary day release earlier this month			1
@entity5 and @entity7 failed to return to @entity8 in @entity9 yesterday evening , and police believe they may be attempting to travel back to their home cities of @entity14 and @entity16 despite going on the run twice beforehand , the robber was allowed to walk out of @entity171 open prison in @entity32 where he was serving 13 life sentences			1
he was eventually caught in @entity174 on may 7 after spending almost four days on the run and has since been charged with robbing the @entity176 , in @entity177 , @entity178 , at gunpoint			2
last year , @entity180 chief inspector of prisons @entity181 said @entity145 had ‘ needlessly restrictive ’ security for an open prison			1
located near @entity186 , the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to @entity190 high security hospital , which houses @entity193 murderer @entity191			2
justice secretary @entity194 said : ' keeping the public safe is our priority and i will not allow the actions of a small minority of offenders undermine public confidence in the prison system ' @entity204 have reached record lows under this government but i take each and every incident seriously			1
i have already ordered immediate changes to tighten up the system as a matter of urgency			1
' with immediate effect , prisoners will no longer be transferred to open conditions or allowed out on temporary release if they have previously absconded , and there will also be no unrestricted " town leave "			2
' i am clear that open prisons and temporary licence remains an important tool in rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public safety			2

@entity5 and @entity7 fled @entity8 open prison on monday
police urged public not to approach the pair , found today
came day after murderer who absconded from open prison was arrested
also a fortnight after @entity30 absconded
he allegedly robbed a building society before being caught four days later
justice secretary has ordered ' urgent ' changes to tighten up system
