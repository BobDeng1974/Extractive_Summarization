by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 22 june 2012 updated : 18:12 est , 22 june 2012 he 's only little but he makes a very big noise			2
when @entity4 brays , his eeyore reverberates around the village , across the valley ... and if the wind is blowing in the right direction , it can be heard in the neighbouring village two miles away			1
he does it late at night and early in the morning , often waking residents			0
most residents in the village of @entity14 in @entity15 are fond of @entity4 the donkey , despite his noisy braying at all hours until now , everyone has accepted the loudmouth ass as a quirk of life in the @entity15 community of @entity14			1
but a single complaint to the council from an unknown source has prompted an investigation into ‘ whether or not the donkey is causing a noise nuisance ’			1
when residents learned his not - so - quiet life in a field behind the village club could be under threat , they rallied round to launch a campaign to save him			1
a @entity40 group called ‘ save the @entity41 from being shot ’ – not that he really faces such a grim fate – has more than 1,100 members			0
beauty therapist @entity46 , 41 , who set up the group , said she was often woken by @entity4 at 4am but could not bear it if anything happened to him			1
@entity4 has been threatened with eviction after neighbours of his owners @entity52 and @entity53 complained to the council about his eeyore she said : ‘ @entity4 has a really distinctive loud eeyore			1
it sounds like someone is being strangled but it ’s part of living around here			0
he makes everybody laugh with his braying , even if it is in the middle of the night			2
' he is very noisy , but he certainly does n’t deserve to be put down or moved out			2
how could anyone want to get rid of him ? ‘ sometimes the noise is a bit overwhelming at 4 or 5am but it ’s no different from living next to a busy road or a railway line			0
you get used to it			0
’ @entity4 ’s owners , @entity71 and @entity72 , discovered a complaint had been made to the council ’s environmental health department when an officer visited last month			1
mr @entity53 , a father of nine , said : ‘ he has got a very loud bray			0
you can hear it over the hill in @entity81 , the next village			2
@entity46 , left , from @entity14 set up a @entity40 page called " save the @entity14 donkey " to try and stop @entity4 , right , from being evicted ‘ we do n’t know why it is so loud but he is only doing what comes naturally and it can sound different depending on his mood			1
he brays if he sees someone coming or going to work in the early hours			0
it ’s his way of saying hello			0
‘ apparently there has been a donkey in the village for at least 100 years and it is supposed to be lucky			0
’ mr @entity53 has received a warning letter detailing the complaint and the council ’s procedure to investigate it			1
but with the support of most villagers behind @entity4 , he believes the complainants will not pursue the matter			1
residents have their suspicions about who lodged the complaint , but no one has claimed responsibility			0
for action to be taken , evidence must be obtained to prove @entity4 is causing a nuisance under the 1990 @entity111			1
councillor @entity112 , @entity113 ’s environment chief , said the complainant is asked to fill in a ‘ diary sheet ’ but the inquiry will be closed if the sheet is not handed in ‘ within the next few days ’			0
he said @entity4 would not be destroyed even if the case was proven			2
it is more likely that he would be moved to a remoter field .			0

most resident in the village of @entity14 , @entity15 are used to @entity4 's braying at all hours
but the council has been forced to investigate after a single complaint
showing their support for noisy @entity4 , villagers have rallied round gaining support for him online
