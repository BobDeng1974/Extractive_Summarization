for a team who only narrowly missed out on the @entity3 title last may and spent more than Â£ 100million on new players in the summer , sitting 11th in the table after 11 games of the season is simply unacceptable			1
that 's the situation facing @entity9 and manager @entity10 after a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity12 on saturday - already their fifth loss of the campaign - left the @entity14 in the bottom half below @entity16 and @entity17			1
but far more concerning than sitting underneath their great rivals is the gap between themselves and league leaders @entity12			0
victory for @entity25 's men at @entity26 took them 15 points clear of @entity28 and the gap looks certain to increase			0
@entity9 stars ( from left to right ) @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity28 look dejected against @entity12 manager @entity10 shakes hands with @entity33 during his side 's 2 - 1 defeat by @entity12 on saturday @entity12 striker @entity36 ( second from right ) blasts home his side 's winner at @entity26 games played ( all competitions ) : 17 wins : 7 ( one on penalties ) draws : 2 defeats : 8 goals conceded : 24 goals scored : 20 at the same stage last season , @entity10 had led his side to second place in the table , had beaten @entity55 ' @entity17 side and had seven wins			1
but having already lost to the likes of @entity58 and @entity59 this time around , @entity9 are nine points off the pace they set last term			2
perhaps even more worrying for fans of a red persuasion is an unwelcome comparison to @entity67 's unsuccessful spell as boss during the 2010 - 11 season			1
after working wonders at @entity71 , @entity67 arrived to oversee an @entity26 revolution but ended up being sacked just over six months into his three - year contract			2
despite his failings - both in the transfer market and on the pitch - the @entity76 @entity75 manager actually managed to accumulate more points after 11 fixtures than @entity10 has now			0
@entity67 masterminded a 2 - 0 win over @entity12 and respectable 1 - 1 draw with @entity84 during @entity9 's start to the 2010 - 11 campaign , earning 15 points , leaving them in ninth spot in the table			1
@entity67 covers his face during a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity92 during his brief spell as @entity9 boss @entity9 players react after @entity97 's equaliser in front of the @entity99 at @entity26 on saturday @entity9 had a better record under @entity67 in the 2010 - 11 season than they do under @entity10 this term but having failed to win any of their last three top - flight clashes , @entity10 ' side have only 14 points and are below @entity59 , @entity106 , @entity107 and high - flying @entity108			1
they have n't fared much better in @entity110 either , having made their return to @entity113 action following a five - year absence brought about by below - par performances in the @entity3			0
two defeats by @entity117 - the second of which came at the @entity119 after @entity10 decided to rest seven first - team players - and another away at @entity121 means @entity9 have now lost eight games in all competitions this season - the same amount as in the whole 2013 - 14 season ( 43 games )			1
@entity117 striker @entity126 ( right ) celebrates after scoring his side 's winning goal against @entity9 @entity28 , @entity129 and @entity130 ( left to right ) started on the bench at the @entity119 their soft defence and lacklustre attack has left their hopes of reaching the knockout stages hanging by a thread , with wins against the @entity140 side and @entity142 @entity141 almost certainly required if they 're to reach the last 16			0
as well as needing his back four to tighten - up considerably , @entity10 also needs his attack to become more potent - and fast - if @entity9 are to turn around their nightmare start			0
the @entity14 have scored just three goals in their last six games in all competitions , with @entity33 's strike against @entity12 coming courtesy of a hefty deflection			1
they failed to find the back of the net in four of those games			0
injured striker @entity154 watches from the stands at @entity26 as @entity9 lose to @entity12 @entity9 are struggling for goals after selling striker @entity157 ( right ) to @entity158 during the summer the sale of last season 's top - scorer @entity157 to @entity158 has undoubtedly had a huge impact on the @entity9 's ability to unlock opposition defences , while two injuries to @entity154 has left summer signings @entity166 and @entity31 toiling up front			2
@entity154 is set to return against @entity168 after the international break as @entity10 ' men aim to gain a measure of revenge on the @entity168 following their capitulation at @entity174 at the end of last season			0
fail to take three points in south @entity178 and @entity10 ' record this season will be even worse than @entity67 's was four years ago			2
@entity181 will tell if the same fate befalls him .			0

@entity9 lost 2 - 1 to @entity12 on saturday and are now 11th in the table
the @entity14 have already lost the same amount of games as they did during the whole of last season
*ex-liverpool* boss @entity67 had a better record at the same stage of the 2010 - 11 campaign
but @entity67 was sacked in *january* 2011 after a run of poor form
the @entity199 outfit have scored just three goals in their last six games
