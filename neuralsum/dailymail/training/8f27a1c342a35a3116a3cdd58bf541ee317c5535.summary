the move follows news earlier this week that it has been overtaken by @entity6 ’ s in terms of market share , pushing it down to third in the supermarket league			2
the chain is owned by @entity13 ’s @entity12 , which is the largest and richest supermarket chain in the world , and positions itself as the cheapest of the @entity15 ’ s major grocers			1
@entity1 in @entity17 , @entity18 : the chain is pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £ 1bn on keeping prices low over five years after losing its second - place market share spot to @entity6 's independent research shows it is routinely cheaper than @entity26 , @entity6 ’s and @entity27 , but despite this it has been losing shoppers to thriving budget chains , such as @entity31 and @entity32			1
the group is now pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £ 1billion on keeping prices down over the next five years			2
however , it is unclear whether this scheme will mean real reductions in the cost of putting food on the table or – more likely – efforts to curtail future rises			2
the company certainly has the financial muscle to demand low prices from suppliers and make savings by buying in bulk , however shoppers have become sceptical about price cut claims			2
all the major stores make great claims to offer low prices and match the deals of others , however the reality for struggling families is that food bills have risen faster than wages over the last five years			0
@entity1 yesterday unveiled a five year strategic plan that will also include hundreds of smaller convenience stores and 1,000 click and collect sites where shoppers can pick up purchases made online			1
budget : independent research shows @entity1 is routinely cheaper than @entity26 , @entity6 's and @entity27 , but despite this it has been losing shoppers to thriving budget chains , such as @entity31 ( pictured ) and @entity32 the chain ’s chief executive , @entity71 , said stores are performing well and sales in the july to september period were up by 0.3per cent on the previous three months			1
‘ we ’ve continued to invest in lowering prices which has held them down for our customers while driving volume growth , ’ he said			0
and he promised more action on prices , saying : ‘ looking to the longer term , we recognised some time ago that no matter whether the macro economy is slowly improving , every day finances remain under pressure and our customers have less time			0
consequently , they are changing the way they live , budget and shop , to adapt to this new economic reality			0
‘ we regard ourselves as the @entity15 ’s leading value retailer and it is against this backdrop that i have today set out our strategic priorities which will improve , extend and expand the business over the next five years			0
‘ there are three major components to this approach which will redefine value			0
first , we will build on our heritage of low prices by rebasing our pricing to the tune of £ 1 billion			0
‘ secondly , we will make a £ 250 million investment in quality , style and design and thirdly , we will expand @entity1 to reach new customers in the @entity15 , particularly @entity18 and the @entity109			1

@entity1 is owned by @entity12 , the world 's largest supermarket chain
research shows it is cheaper than rivals , but is losing out to @entity31 and @entity32
it is unclear whether prices will drop , or merely be maintained
