by @entity1 reporter published : 07:58 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 6 september 2013 accusations : paranormal medium @entity3 was giving a ghost tour around a hotel when a man was discovered hiding in the attic after ' ghostly sounds ' were heard from the roof the ghost hunters were gathered in awed silence in the stables of the inn when they heard a clear message from the other side – two knocks on the ceiling			1
it sent a shiver around the room , but one seeker of the supernatural still was n’t satisfied			0
he chose to hang around in the hope of a close encounter – and minutes later got more than he bargained for when a ‘ ghost ’ popped out of the attic , very much alive			2
now a row has now broken out between paranormal medium @entity3 who led the £ 12 - a - head ghost hunt and the owner of the hotel who are both accusing each other of pulling the stunt			1
hotel owner @entity37 said he spotted the man leaving the attic just 20 minutes after the ghost tour and has accused the psychic of foul play			1
but mr date , 38 , who calls himself the @entity45 , yesterday denied being to blame for the mystery man in the attic at the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50 , and claimed he has been set up			1
the historic hotel has been used as a coaching house with stables , a hospital , abattoir and even a prison over the course of its 225 year history			2
there have been numerous sightings of ghosts over the years - including the spirit of a five - year - old boy			2
mr date brought seven paying guests on the ghost hunt to try and contact the spirit world			1
the ghost hunters were led into the stables of the hotel when medium mr date asked a spirit to knock twice in answer to a question			1
and the guests were hushed as two ghostly knocks were heard from the ceiling above			2
but just 20 minutes later , hotel staff and members of the public saw a man climb out of an attic near where the knocking sounds had come from			1
location : staff at the @entity48 , pictured , in @entity49 , @entity50 , claim they spotted a man climbing out of the attic after the ghost tour and promptly made him leave the premises @entity91 owner @entity37 said : ' we gave him the keys to the hotel around 4pm in the afternoon to set up and i think he used that time to put someone in the attic			1
' during the hunt later that night he was calling out to the ghost world and asked for them to knock as an answer			2
well , it sounded like someone knocking on the front door			0
' a member of staff and a member of the public wanted to see if someone came down from the attic where the knocking was coming from			2
' twenty minutes went by and then this guy jumped down			0
our staff grabbed the guy and threw him out			0
' @entity114 [ date ] wanted his first evening running a ghost hunt to go with a bang but it backfired in a big way			1
@entity91 owner @entity37 said the man jumped down from the attic 20 minutes after the ' ghostly knocking ' from the ceiling ' he did n’t get away with what he expected to get away with			1
' ghost hunt guest @entity122 , 43 , said the attic man claimed he was homeless and had nothing to do with the spooky sounds			1
but sceptic mr @entity122 claims the ' homeless man ' was wearing ' designer jeans '			2
he claimed psychic medium mr date drove away from the hotel shortly after the man was caught climbing down from the attic			1
mr @entity122 said : ' in life the only certainty , other than being born , is death			0
' billions of people have a religion and they are all looking for the same thing - that there ’s something else after death			0
' people who are looking for answers could be vulnerable			0
' professional medium mr date denied allegations he planted a man in the attic to pretend to be a ghost			1
he said : ' it was nothing to do with me , i believe the whole thing was orchestrated to try and set me up , which is one of the reasons why i left			0
' the knocking did not sound like what i am used to			0
i said on several occasions that it was odd , the noise was too extreme			0
' i take what i am doing very seriously			0
i believe in what i do so i would never do anything like this			0
' i have got a very good track record			0
it ’s disgusting , i would never do that			0
' on mr date ’s website he is described as ' a great intuitive reader who speaks from the heart '			1
it tells potential customers : ' if you are lost and need to find your way again or if you need reassurance then a reading from @entity45 is for you			0
' a male medium with a strong spiritual guide who comes forward to help enable connections with those who have passed over			0
' witness : ghost hunt guest @entity182 , from @entity183 , saw the man escape from the attic and believes he may have been homeless			1
