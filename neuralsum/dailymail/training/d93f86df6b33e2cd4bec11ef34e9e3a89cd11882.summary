by @entity0 published : 08:27 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 10:58 est , 15 september 2013 so what did we learn from @entity3 ? for a start , that sports - luxe will yet again dominate next summer for what feels like the hundredth time running			0
but also that @entity3 really is something quite special			0
this , and it 's easy to forget it , is only her fifth outing but she already has a grasp of tailoring and colour of the sort that would make more established names proud			0
and she showed both off to the full in a collection that combined a pitch - perfect palette with sleek silhouettes and wearable separates			1
like them , she understands that a carefully calibrated palette of shimmering grey , delicate blush pink and fiery crimson lifts excellent tailoring out of the office and into must - have territory			1
and like them , she does it beautifully			0
a case in point were the lovely dove - grey chiffon trousers teamed with a rugged waffle knit in muted oatmeal and given a fashionable edge with the help of a perfectly - tailored thigh - length white coat			1
the blazer , a recurring piece , appeared in scarlet , paired with a delicate multi-layered minidress in a soft ombre that transitioned from black to grey to white before ending with bright crimson			1
showstopper : a column dress in pale grey and tomato red in the pink : blush gave the sporty look a shot of femininity accomplished : @entity31 showed off her grasp of tailoring wearable : @entity31 's perfectly chosen palette and well - executed styling brightened a gloomy saturday morning delicate blush and dove - grey ombre popped up again and again , most daringly on a beautifully tailored slouchy trousers and blazer combo			1
inevitably , @entity31 's trademark graffiti print put in an appearance : scaled down and mixed with charming doodles on a grey silk shirt dress and loud and proud in bold black lines on a body suit worn with a delicate pair of silvery shorts			1
a robust sportiness kept dresses from becoming too girly , with a striped column in tomato and pale grey benefiting from discreet sheer panels and flashes of print			2
most of what appeared was thoroughly wearable but more than that , everything was utterly wantable and deserving of more than a rainy saturday morning slot			0
although sports - luxe has become something of a recurring @entity106 trend , @entity31 showed that repeats do n't always have to be boring			2
her graffiti splattered , soft - hued vision for summer was proof that sporty summer separates still have fashion mileage , while her wonderful all - red finale did an excellent job of brightening up a gloomy saturday morning			2
roll on next summer .			0
