by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 04:43 est , 21 december 2012 a range of rude number of plates that use letters and numbers to spell out words such as penis and orgasm have been put up for sale for thousands of pounds each			1
the cheeky plates include the indiscreet ' @entity11 ' - on sale for a staggering a £ 90,000			1
but the rude registration is not even the most expensive in the range			2
rude : drivers wanting to purchase the registration @entity16 will have to fork out £ 135,000 expensive : the set of rude number plates is being sold by regtransfers.co.uk			1
@entity11 15 is being sold for £ 90,000 drivers who would like the registration ' @entity22 ' displayed on their car will have to fork out £ 135,000			1
other number plates in the collection include ' @entity27 ' , costing £ 22,650			1
the registration ' @entity30 ' - reminiscent of the word ' @entity29 ' - is even selling for £ 13,650			2
the plates are being sold by regtransfers.co.uk , who insist that they are legal despite licensing rules that say inappropriate combinations can be removed			0
the website 's @entity38 said : ' there is actually nothing rude or inappropriate about it , it ’s just the way that it is interpreted by some			0
' obviously , there are connotations associated with the plate , but arguably , it has become something of a modern day antique and in addition to providing hours of conversations and joviality , the @entity11 15 plate is also a wise investment			0
' although the rude range is being made available to the public , the @entity53 often ' suppresses ' number plates that may cause offence			1
banned : @entity59 from @entity60 , was instructed by the @entity53 to remove the plate ' @entity62 ' from his @entity63 last year , just six weeks after he had bought it for £ 399 plates that have been banned by the organisation include , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
a @entity53 panel decides what number and letter combinations may cause offence before plates are issued and offending combinations are then withheld from circulation			1
banned plates can include combinations clearly bearing a resemblance to offensive terms , including @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
but the agency 's decision to ban more trivial combinations has left some perplexed			0
in 2007 , number plates in @entity88 bearing the sequence @entity90 were banned for being offensive , as the sequence could bear a resemblance to the word ' snot '			1
@entity59 , from @entity60 , was instructed to remove a plate from his vehicle last year , just six weeks after he had bought it			0
@entity59 had spent £ 399 on the ' @entity62 ' plate for his new @entity63 , but soon received a stern letter from the @entity53 telling him the plate was ' causing offence ' and ordering him to remove it			2
cheeky : car - owners will have to spend £ 9,000 for this number plate many number plates , including @entity11 , were issued by local authorities before the @entity53 came into existence			1
if the agency receives a complaint about such a plate , a review can be launched as to whether it is appropriate			0
a @entity114 said : ' @entity53 regularly reviews the appropriateness of registration numbers as society changes			2
our policy in respect of withholding registration numbers is clear			0
' they are withheld in instances where if displayed on a number plate they are likely to cause general offence or embarrassment			0
the reasons can be on the grounds of political , racial and religious sensitivities or simply that they are regarded as being in poor taste			0
' if we are made aware that a previously issued number is deemed offensive , we would consider withdrawing the number			0
