by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor nearly 10 per cent of the criminals kept in open prisoners are murderers , the government has admitted			1
the revelation comes amid heightened fears over the security at open prisons after the armed bank robber known as the ' @entity11 ' walked out of one while on day release			1
@entity14 went on the run for four days after absconding earlier this month			0
he was eventually recaptured and charged with robbing a building society at gun point			0
armed robber @entity14 , @entity18 the @entity11 , went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison @entity14 , who earned his @entity21 nickname for ' pistol whipping ' bank staff with imitation guns , was allowed to stay in open prison despite being given 13 life sentences in 2002 for bank raids and having a history of prison escapes			1
now it has emerged that @entity14 is far from the only dangerous criminal kept in open prison			2
in a @entity34 the @entity33 said more than 350 murderers and 70 people serving sentences for manslaughter are in open prisons , which have minimal supervision			1
in december 2013 , figures showed that 363 murderers were housed in such institutions , almost 10 per cent of the 4,092 inmates in open prisons across @entity45 and @entity46			1
other prisoners include those convicted of attempted murder , wounding , assault and attacks in children			0
@entity14 , who was eligible for release after eight years , went on the run for four days earlier this month after leaving @entity55 open prison on day release and failing to return			1
he was arrested , together with another man , in @entity59 , east @entity60 , after allegedly robbing a branch of the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			0
@entity65 issued this mugshot of ' @entity11 ' @entity14 , after he went missing while temporarily being allowed out of prison earlier this month the notorious armed robber had a history of absconding since being jailed in 1984 for nine years following a series of shop raids			1
in 1988 he escaped while on a hospital visit and went on to commit nine break - ins			2
in 1989 he was jailed for 16 years for break - ins and robberies , reduced to 11 years on appeal			2
three years later , while on a day release to an optician , he went on the run again and went on to commit several armed robberies			1
and in 1993 he was jailed for a further seven years and in 2002 given the 13 life sentences , with a minimum term of eight years			0
last summer he was transferred to open conditions , but was returned to a proper prison in december after concerns were raised about his behaviour			0
in february his probation officer approved his return to an open prison before he disappeared on may 3			0
@entity90 , the @entity90 mp for @entity91 , @entity92 , said people would be ' shocked ' that murderers were serving sentences in prisons where ' they are basically free to … walk out of the gates '			2
he said : ' most people thought that the people who were in open prisons were no real threat to anyone , who would not go up to anyone and do anyone any physical harm			1
' the prison authorities try and create the impression that these cases are one - offs when you need a one - off inquiry , but this is not a one - off situation , it is general practice			0
i do n’t believe that all of those 363 murderers are safe , fully rehabilitated , no danger to the public			1
' @entity120 , the prisons minister , said all inmates housed in such conditions were ' suitably risk - assessed ' before they were released into the community under ' appropriate licence conditions '			2
@entity126 , an adviser to the probation union @entity129 , insisted that ' open jails are needed to help rehabilitation '			0
he said : ' however , prisoners should only be allocated following a full risk assessment			0
in this case staff seem to have been worried about further offending and absconding			0
' there is a history of running away while on day release			1
the issue is a failure of government to provide enough secure places and pressure on staff to move prisoners through the system			0

more than *400* *killers* are in open prisons - including 363 murderers
comes after armed robber the ' @entity11 ' escaped while on day release
