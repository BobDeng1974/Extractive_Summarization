@entity5 , still seeking his first win since the @entity26 in november last year which meant he became the first man to win the @entity28 and race to @entity30 in the same season , refused to throw in the towel and birdied the 13th to reduce his deficit			0
but after almost holing his chip from the back of the 14th green , the @entity34 could only look on as @entity0 holed from 12 feet for birdie to move three ahead again , this time with just four holes remaining			0
@entity5 fought back once more with a two - putt birdie on the par - five 15th , but was unable to birdie either of the next two holes as @entity0 - who had beaten @entity42 2 & 1 in the semi-finals - secured the biggest win of his career			0
@entity5 hits his tee - shot while @entity0 watches on during the all - @entity47 final at the @entity6 in @entity48 @entity0 , winner of the @entity12 in june , won arguably the biggest prize of his career on sunday			1
