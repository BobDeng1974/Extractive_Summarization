@entity0 up with feeling ripped off and patronised by male mechanics ? so was mother - of - two @entity3 , the brains behind @entity6 - the @entity8 's first all - female garage			1
now in its tenth year her business venture has proved so popular that many men - as well as women - flock to her @entity14 workshop			2
@entity16 , 42 , said : ' [ going to ] garages can be a terrifying experience for many women – i know women who prefer going to the dentist than going to a garage			1
' women come here because they know they can trust me , and that i ’m not going to rip them off			0
i want to encourage women to not be afraid and feel safe – it ’s engrained in society that women automatically know nothing about cars			0
' the success has even led to a strong demand by men to have their cars fixed and looked at by my garage – we ’re getting a good reputation and i think people just warm to women			1
' @entity16 was forced to work as an unpaid apprentice for four years before she convinced her male boss to take her on as a paid employee			2
as a result , she became one of the first women in the country to become a qualified @entity68 tester			0
but after hearing countless complaints from women who had suffered harrowing experiences at male - dominated garages @entity16 decided it was time to launch her own business			1
messy : @entity16 ( right ) and her staff have no qualms about getting covered in oil and grease at work results : @entity6 has lots of happy customers and @entity3 would like to open branches elsewhere @entity16 said : ' many women can leave feeling extremely intimidated and worried about the service they ’re being given			2
' some women even know they ’re being ripped off but are too scared to question the man ’s diagnosis so pay extortionate amounts out of fear			0
' having launched her business with help from two friends @entity95 and @entity96 , @entity16 has since been forced to hire some manly helping hands to cope with the workload			0
but there ’s always pink overalls - the shop ’s compulsory uniform - for any new additions			0
@entity16 said : ' whenever we have workshops we always get the men dressed up in pink uniforms - i even had my bank manager in them when he came in to my shop			0
' with dreams of being able to franchise @entity16 ’s cars and have test centres and garages across the @entity8 , the motoring enthusiast also thinks women should learn more about their cars			1
@entity16 launched a series of educational classes for women introducing common faults and how to maintain cars but soon received requests from men to attend the women - only lessons			1
@entity16 said : ' a lot of men complained about my female - only teaching classes so of course i opened my arms to them and now we cater for anybody who wants to learn a bit more about their car and what to look out for			2
' it ’s not just young women who prefer a female garage ; men are exactly the same about big burly mechanics and their " backstreet " reputations			1
' i hope to expand my business and franchise it so we can have female garages up and down the country			0
' @entity147 required : even the men who venture onto @entity16 's forecourt have to don the garage 's pink overalls			1

@entity16 's cars in @entity14 is the @entity8 's first all - female garage
according to founder @entity26 , 42 , women are sick of being ripped off
popularity among women has led to a strong demand from male clients
' people just warm to women , ' *explains* the owner and head mechanic
