just one district in @entity1 has seen its proportion of migrants fall in the last decade			1
the percentage of the population from abroad in @entity7 's @entity6 - a rural peninsula near @entity9 - was 0.9 per cent lower in 2011 than in 2001 , despite rising everywhere else			1
in some parts of the country the proportion of migrants in the general population doubled , the report found , and in two areas it more than tripled , according to an @entity18 report			1
rural : @entity7 's @entity6 features @entity19 ( pictured ) , retirement cottages , holiday homes ... and the status of the only district in @entity1 where the proportion of migrants fell between 2001 and 2011 the biggest increase was in @entity27 , @entity28 , where the proportion of migrants almost quintupled from 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the town 's residents			1
and in @entity33 , @entity34 , the proportion of migrants rose from 1.4 per cent to 4.5 per cent			1
the figures were compiled by the @entity36 , a body based at the @entity38 at @entity18			1
experts looked at the changes in @entity1 's make - up between the 2001 census and the 2011 census			2
although @entity45 still has by far the highest proportion of migrants per head of population , the biggest increases were almost all outside the capital			1
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 were among the biggest changers , with all seeing the proportion of migrants in the population more than double			1
increase : @entity27 , @entity28 , has seen its proportion of migrants increase from 3 per cent to 15 per cent @entity61 was the only place where the proportion of migrants fell , but even there , the actual number rose - by eight people			1
the rural area is popular with tourists and has become a hotspot for holiday homes and retirement cottages , driving up the price of houses for everyone else			1
most of @entity61 is made up of woods and fields and it features @entity19 , a former fortress which was partially demolished in the @entity80			2
@entity81 , director of @entity83 estate agents in @entity84 , @entity61 's largest town , said : ' there 's two reasons behind the low number of migrants			1
' the first is income - i would expect many new migrants are n't earning enough to pay what are the higher rents that we seem to have			2
' the rents are pushed up by the high number of second homes and retirement homes			0
a lot of our clients are cash buyers looking to settle down in the area for a quiet life			0
gradual change : the figures provided by the @entity36 at @entity18 coincided with a report by the same body , which looked at the rise in @entity1 's migrant population in the past 20 years ( above ) population : 45,200 average age : 45 cost of detached home : £ 410,000 average full - time wages : £ 24,000 unemployment : 4.1 % top - rated tourist sight : @entity117 population : 58,100 average age : 42 cost of detached home : £ 184,000 average full - time wages : £ 22,600 unemployment : 5.4 % top - rated tourist sight : @entity124 ' the second reason is the number of jobs			1
migrants would want to move somewhere that 's got good job prospects and a lot of work here is seasonal - although we do get some workers in the hospitality industry			1
' in @entity27 , high levels of migration have helped the 55,000 - strong population of 2001 rise by around 10,000			1
the town 's @entity142 mp @entity141 has led a campaign to win more government funding for the area , whose migration figures were described as unique in a @entity150 report last year			2
the rankings coincide with a report yesterday by the @entity36 which examined changes to @entity1 's make - up over the past 20 years			1
' the share of foreign - born people in the @entity1 ’s total population increased by over 50 per cent between 1993 and 2013 , ' the report said			1
data : @entity45 still has by far the highest proportion of foreign - born citizens overall compared to other areas ' the @entity1 population was 12.5 per cent foreign - born and 8 per cent @entity165 citizens in 2013			1
' the report included @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 , but not @entity170 , because of the number of people crossing the border from the @entity174 who count as @entity177 migrants			0
the top four countries sending people to @entity1 were @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity170			0
@entity183 , @entity184 , the @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 all featured high on the list , which looked at both nationality and country of birth			0
some 13 per cent of all migrants are now @entity182 nationals , higher than any other country			0
@entity182 nationals have been free to live and work in @entity1 since the country joined the @entity177 in 2004			0
