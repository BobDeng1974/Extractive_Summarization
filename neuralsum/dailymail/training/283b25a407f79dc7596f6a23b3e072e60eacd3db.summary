by @entity1 reporter published : 11:38 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 11:43 est , 15 november 2012 acknowledgement : @entity4 finance minister @entity3 has officially signed off on revisions to the original 1952 compensation treaty for holocaust survivors @entity4 has announced plans to increase pension payments to @entity11 survivors as they enter their final years			1
it comes sixty years after a landmark accord started @entity4 government compensation for victims of @entity17 crimes			1
most @entity11 survivors experienced extreme trauma as children , suffered serious malnutrition , and lost almost all of their relatives - leaving them today with severe psychological and medical problems , and little or no family support network to help them cope			1
in acknowledgement of that , @entity4 finance minister @entity3 has officially signed off on revisions to the original 1952 compensation treaty			0
it will increase pensions for those living in eastern @entity33 and broaden who is eligible for payments			1
contributions to home care for survivors have already been increased			2
@entity39 , chairman of the @entity40 , said : ' survivors are passing away on a daily basis but the other side is that individual survivors are needing more help than ever			0
' while a person came out of the camps very young and eventually developed a life of their own over the years , the impact of what happened at the beginning is now coming to the fore			0
' whether it 's mentally or physically , they 're sicker than their peers of the same age ' @entity4 has paid - primarily to @entity60 survivors - some 70 billion euros in compensation overall for @entity17 crimes since the agreement was signed in 1952			1
in one change to the treaty that @entity4 agreed to earlier this year , the country will provide compensation payments to a new category of @entity17 victims - some 80,000 jews who fled ahead of the advancing @entity4 army and mobile killing squads and eventually resettled in the @entity74			1
on november 1 , they became eligible for one - time payments of 2,556 euros			2
the amendment also formalizes an increase in pensions for @entity11 survivors living in formerly communist eastern @entity33 to the same as those living elsewhere - an icrease to 300 euro per month - from the 200 to 260 euro they had been receiving			1
lasting legacy : most @entity11 survivors experienced extreme trauma as children , suffered serious malnutrition , and lost almost all of their relatives ( pictured prisoners of the @entity91 ) @entity4 is set to increase the pensions for holocaust survivors			1
picture taken in 1942 shows @entity60 deportees in the @entity97 transit camp , their last stop before the @entity4 concentration camps @entity3 said on @entity100 before the signing ceremony at @entity103 's @entity102 that once @entity4 and the @entity40 had identified the additional victims living in the east , it was only natural to include them in the compensation agreement			2
' we still do not know the names of all of the victims , ' @entity3 said			0
' the crimes of the @entity11 were so inconceivably enormous that you ca n't know all of the victims or those with claims , so you have to adjust it again and again			1
' @entity4 already increased payments this year for home care for @entity11 survivors by 15 percent over 2011 , and has pledged to raise that further in 2013 and 2014			1
compensation has been ever evolving since the 1952 agreement , with annual negotiations between the @entity40 and the @entity4 government on who should receive funds and how much will be paid			0
yet , even 67 years after the end of @entity128 , there is much to set right , said @entity129 , the former @entity130 ambassador to the @entity131 who serves as the @entity40 's special negotiator			0
' one of the things that drives me is that with all of that , the best surveys out there are there are probably 500,000 survivors alive today worldwide and half of them are in poverty or very close to the poverty line , ' he said			0
' this is an ongoing responsibility - this is not the end of the road			0
' @entity129 said it is a tribute to @entity4 and officials there that the country continues to acknowledge responsibility for @entity17 - era crimes - both with the compensation payments and also in its actions			2
' i was very much taken by the degree to which they had come to terms with @entity128 and were dealing with its consequences , through mandatory @entity11 education ; through seemingly small , but important , things like putting plaques in front of homes of @entity60 who had been expelled ; by building a monumental above - ground holocaust memorial right in the center of reunified @entity103 , ' he said			2
' it 's a very sharp contrast to what @entity168 has done in recognizing their responsibilities ... it 's quite striking			0
' conference chairman @entity172 said the fact that the @entity4 government decided to host an event to announce the latest results of negotiations with the @entity40 at a @entity103 event shows it remains committed			0
' to me the most significant part of this event ... is that the @entity4 government wanted it ... telling again not only the whole world but more importantly telling the @entity4 people that it 's not over , ' he said .			0

announced 60 years after first payout for @entity11 survivors
will be paid in recognition of ' extreme trauma suffered by victims of @entity17 crimes '
it will increase pensions for those living in eastern @entity33 and broaden who is eligible for payments
