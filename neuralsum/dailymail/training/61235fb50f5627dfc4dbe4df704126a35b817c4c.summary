by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:26 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 9 april 2013 @entity2 faced a growing crisis over welfare yesterday as leading @entity6 figures backed calls for the party to adopt a tougher stance on benefits			1
at least seven of his mps – including his own parliamentary aide and members of the @entity15 – said @entity6 can not be the party of people ‘ languishing on benefits ’			1
they spoke out as mr @entity2 launched @entity6 ’s local election campaign yesterday , which denounced the government ’s attempts to rein in welfare spending as ‘ heartless and hopeless ’			1
challenge : @entity2 has faced calls from at least seven mps to back a tougher stance on welfare , including comments from @entity29 , right , who used an article to call on the @entity6 leader to change his stance however , there is growing concern among @entity25 that mr @entity2 ’s blanket opposition to every attempt to trim state handouts has left the party on the wrong side of public opinion			1
a @entity43 poll yesterday showed that 80 per cent of voters think that benefit payments are too high – including 51 per cent of @entity6 ’s own supporters			2
outlining his views on the issue in an article published online yesterday , @entity6 mp @entity29 led the calls for mr @entity2 to change his approach			1
he said : ‘ seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the @entity57 should be proud of			2
‘ it ’s something we should be fighting			0
otherwise why call ourselves the @entity6 ? ’ ‘ far too many people tell me they feel their taxes are “ wasted ” on welfare largesse and these voices can not be ignored			1
’ ‘ if welfare is to be targeted more efficiently at those who need it then we have to condemn those who abuse the system			0
’ ‘ the @entity6 is a moral crusade or it is nothing , said @entity72			2
it ’s time this sense of crusading zeal was applied to helping people off benefits			2
seeing people that are capable of working languish for years on benefits is not something the @entity57 should be proud of			2
it ’s something we should be fighting			0
’ ‘ @entity57 has to accept there are some people on the dole that do n’t want to work , and we need to have a plan to get them into work			0
’ @entity29 , @entity6 mp for @entity91 earlier , the mp had tweeted that ‘ simply complaining about cuts to benefits is easy , comfy , cosy politics which does n’t help anyone ’			1
@entity25 who mostly represent working - class constituencies then used @entity97 to show their support for his calls by endorsing mr @entity29 ’s article			1
@entity102 , a former aide to @entity103 who is now a @entity6 frontbencher on work and pensions , tweeted : ‘ completely right to say people left “ for years on benefits not something @entity57 should be proud of ”			1
’ @entity6 ’s international development spokesman @entity109 and mr @entity2 ’s parliamentary private secretary @entity110 retweeted a link to mr @entity29 ’s article , as did rising star @entity112 , another frontbencher			1
@entity114 mp @entity113 called it a ‘ strong ’ article , while @entity118 mp @entity117 hailed it as an ‘ excellent contribution to the welfare debate ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s time to hear new voices grounded in experience			2
’ former @entity6 general secretary @entity125 said it was evidence of ‘ sanity on welfare ’			0
by contrast , mr @entity2 yesterday took aim at the government ’s plans for welfare reform			0
he also accused @entity135 and @entity136 of ‘ exploiting ’ the case of child killer @entity138 last week when they condemned how the benefits system allowed him to milk £ 60,000 out of the state each year after fathering 17 children			0
mr @entity2 said : ‘ here ’s the problem with this government – they are not just heartless , they are hopeless too			0
support : @entity102 , left , and @entity113 appeared to back mr @entity29 's comments in the article ‘ do you try and unite the country and bring it together , or do you exploit tragedy , like the @entity138 tragedy , and the right place for him is behind bars			1
talking tough : @entity158 had called for a return to the contributory principle in comments at the weekend ‘ of course there are a minority of people on benefits who should be working and are not			0
‘ @entity6 is the party that is going to get them back to work			1
but what i ’m not going to do is engage in nasty , divisive politics			0
‘ if people want that nasty , divisive politics , then you have got the @entity173 – you ’re not going to get it from me			0
’ but shadow work and pensions secretary @entity158 sought to talk tough on the issue at the weekend			0
he called for a return to the contributory principle under which those who have worked for years get more generous benefits than those who have not			0
he also suggested the jobless should go to the back of the queue for council housing			0
but those proposals began to unravel within hours , with @entity6 ’s deputy leader @entity186 stressing that the plans were only ideas for ‘ discussion ’ and were not party policy			1
former @entity6 welfare reform minister @entity191 said the party faced a huge challenge on the subject , adding : ‘ we have been here before , and we ducked it before			1
‘ the real question is , as @entity6 now moves up towards the general election , are we going to have an alternative			2
