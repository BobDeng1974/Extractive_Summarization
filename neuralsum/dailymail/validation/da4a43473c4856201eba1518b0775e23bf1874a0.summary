and this is extremely dangerous , warn the researchers , as taking your eye off the road for just two seconds can increase the risk of an accident up to 24 times			0
researchers from @entity16 studied driver distractions			1
they found texting , eating and other tasks were more distracting than ever			1
and they warned that young drivers are unaware of the dangers			1
a previous study found that text - driving ( stock image shown ) was equivalent to being drunk the researchers , led by @entity16 compiled findings that showed so - called ' distracted driving ' was a bigger problem than ever			1

the striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across @entity35 on their way to work this friday			0
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the @entity35 , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment			0
experts have warned that drivers may be distracted as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter			2
@entity52 spokesman @entity51 told @entity53 : ‘ the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist ’s perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness			0
' he said that distraction is a major cause of accidents on the road and was a contributory factor in 23 per cent of fatal accidents in 2013			0
' based on recent studies , anything that takes your attention away , any glance away from the road for two seconds or longer can increase the risk of an accident from four to 24 times , ' said dr @entity75 from the university			0
' this is a dramatic increase in risk , with inexperienced drivers who are least able to handle it			0
' according to @entity16 , a previous study found that texting was equivalent to being drunk			1
' the absolute worst is texting on a phone , which is a whole group of distractions , ' added dr @entity75			2
' with texting , you 're doing something besides driving , thinking about something besides driving , and looking at the wrong thing			2
' in their study , the researchers found that interactive presentations administered to young drivers in a classroom or auditorium can raise their awareness of the problem			1
they concluded that more young people should be educated in this manner			0
while many young drivers understand the risks of texting , dr @entity75 said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real			1

while many young drivers understand the risks of texting , dr @entity75 said they are much less aware of other concerns that can be real			1
these include eating , drinking , talking on a cell phone , smoking , adjusting the radio ( stock image shown ) , changing a cd , using a digital map or other controls ' automobile manufacturers have made cars significantly safer , but in the interests of passenger comfort they also continue to add more pleasant distractions within the vehicle , ' dr @entity75 said			2
' more experienced drivers learn how to control these distractions , but we 're finding the most problems with the very young driver , within six months of getting a license			1
' aside from lack of experience , he said , young drivers also have a higher risk tolerance , use seat belts less , and choose higher speeds			1
the recent research found that 27 per cent of respondents changed clothes or shoes while driving , and some worked on homework			2
however , they added that it was ' reasonably safe ' to talk to other passengers in the car			0
' for one thing , if an incident happens that requires a quick reaction , everyone in the car may see it , stop talking and pay immediate attention , ' said dr @entity75			0
' and you literally have more sets of eyes on the road to see upcoming problems			0
' there are some gender differences among young drivers , too			1
females are more likely to use a phone while driving , and males are more likely to look away from the road while talking to others in the car			0
the project was funded by the @entity172 , an initiative supported by @entity16 , the @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and the @entity177 .			2
