a report into the management of the @entity3 that is said to be damning is being sat on by ministers , it was claimed last night			1
former @entity6 boss @entity5 was asked a year ago by health secretary @entity7 to assess how @entity3 hospitals could keep ‘ the very best leaders to help transform the culture in underperforming hospitals ’			1
he handed his report to ministers on time at the end of last year , but it has not been given a publication date , according to the @entity17			2
launching the @entity26 in february , mr @entity7 described lord @entity5 as ‘ one of the country ’s most inspirational leaders ’ and said his report could play a significant role in stopping hospitals failing in the future			1
mr @entity7 added : ‘ the difference between good and bad care can often lie in leadership			2
’ the @entity17 said last night that lord @entity5 ’s report – which is said to have described the overall standard of much @entity3 management as ‘ totally shocking ’ – had been handed to the @entity39 in december			1
despite ministers receiving it , the paper claimed that no publication date has been set			0
one individual who has been in meetings where the report was discussed said it had been put on ‘ the back burner ’			2
lord @entity5 , now chairman of online supermarket @entity49 , has concluded that mediocre managers are allowed to move from job to job without being held to account			0
the retail chief credited with turning around the fortunes of @entity6 is concerned that @entity3 managers – lacking the same control over pay and conditions as private sector counterparts – too often rely on top - down diktats to drive performance , according to a source with whom he discussed the report			1
the @entity3 has been @entity21 ’s spearhead policy which it has championed in its bid to win may ’s general election			1
but criticism of its track record in @entity71 , where @entity21 controls the @entity3 , has called the party ’s ability to run the health service into question			1
former @entity6 boss @entity76 ( above ) , who is now chairman of online supermarket @entity49 , was described by mr @entity7 as ‘ one of the country ’s most inspirational leaders ’ and said his report could play a significant role for this reason @entity84 strategists will be anxious to avoid criticism of their own record with the @entity3			1
@entity88 , @entity89 ’s election adviser , has emphasised that nothing should detract from the @entity91 ’ focus on their economic record			0
criticism of @entity3 management is a thorny issue for the coalition after contentious reforms were implemented almost two years ago in an attempt to make the @entity3 more efficient			2
the changes were designed to simplify management structures and hand power to clinicians			0
however the measures were recently branded by the @entity105 , a respected think tank , as an expensive distraction from the real problems facing the service , and the result had been a lack of ‘ system leadership ’			0
negative comments from a private sector leader could be particularly sensitive given opposition claims that the government is seeking to privatise the @entity3 – even though lord @entity5 ’s remit specifically precluded consideration of a bigger role for private sector companies			1
the @entity39 said : ‘ we will be publishing the report in due course			0
’ @entity122 has been accused of misleading voters after @entity21 sent out letters made to look like they were from a hospital or gp surgery			2
many were left upset by the mail , which could easily be mistaken for test results or notification of changes in local @entity3 provision			0
the letters come in envelopes saying that they contain important information about the @entity3			0
it is only when people read the contents that they realise it is a message from the @entity21 leader			0
mr @entity122 has been condemned as ‘ cruel ’ and ‘ insensitive ’ after the letters were received by hospital patients , the elderly and families of the recently deceased			0
opponents accused him of scare tactics and say it is further evidence of his campaign to ‘ weaponise ’ the @entity3 ahead of the general election			1
in the letter , mr @entity122 writes about the ‘ challenges facing your local hospital ’ and warns that ‘ services here are struggling ’			0
despite the claim that it concerns the future of ‘ local @entity3 services ’ , exactly the same message is being sent to homes across the country			1
misleading ? : across the top of the envelope is the message : ‘ important information about the future of local @entity3 services ' and recipients only find out the letter 's true message once they have opened it			0
