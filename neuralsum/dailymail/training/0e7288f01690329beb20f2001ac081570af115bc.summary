by @entity0 published : 04:32 est , 27 january 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 28 january 2013 families should help to feed and wash patients according to a new report to be presented to @entity4 families should take on the role of nurses by helping to feed and wash patients to ease pressure on busy hospital staff , a new report has said			1
as well as basic nursing duties , relatives should also be on hand to help patients to the toilet , it was claimed			1
the report , created by think - tank 2020health , says such duties should be mandatory in the same way as jury service			1
' @entity23 to @entity24 ' , which will be sent to health secretary @entity4 , claims that nurses are finding it impossible to meet all patients needs as the number of elderly people with complex conditions , such as dementia , rises			1
@entity33 , founder of 2020health , said the rules should be laid out in the @entity35 , making it compulsory for relatives and friends of patients to help unless they have a reason they are unable to - in much the same way as jury service			1
she said that many stories of substandard care stem from patients not having help with basic needs such as assisting to the toilet , feeding and drinking			2
she said : ' if you have 20 patients all being served lunch as the same time and 15 need help with eating , it is an impossible task			2
' she added : ' there is an opportunity here for the government , society and the @entity35			0
' the financial reality is that we simply ca n’t afford to employ ever more @entity35 staff to meet the needs of older people in hospital , who make up two thirds of inpatients with 30 per cent of them having dementia			1
' the @entity35 of today has completely different demands upon it compared to sixty years ago , and we have to adapt to this			0
' the cultural reality is that we need to encourage caring – as a common good and as a responsibility			0
' it comes after figures reveal that in 2011 43 patients starved to death in hospital and a further 287 died malnourished			1
@entity84 also show 558 cases where patients died severely dehydrated			0
the report has been welcomed by the @entity88			0
chairwoman @entity89 said it should be ' mandatory that relatives and friends help where possible '			1
@entity94 , chief executive of the @entity88 of @entity95 agreed the family should be at the heart of care planning			0
but patients ' groups do not agree			0
@entity101 of the @entity102 said : ' the first duty of the @entity35 is to provide safe care to patients and not to depend on relatives who may be frail or elderly or unable to visit as regularly because they have to work			1
' as well as basic nursing duties , relatives should also be on hand to help patients to the toilet			2
the report , created by think - tank 2020health , says such duties should be mandatory in the same way as jury service the report calls for a proper training and accreditation system for healthcare assistants , following the @entity121 scandal in @entity122 , in which care home staff were filmed abusing adults with learning difficulties it said it is possible to apply for a job in a care home with no experience and added that the bulk of care given outside acute hospitals is to the elderly and frail who ' deserve as much right to protection as the young			1
' a @entity138 spokesperson said : ' having the support of a loved one or family member can be of great help and comfort to patients			2
we recognise that , where appropriate , allowing them to assist with basic care can be beneficial			0
' however this can be no substitute for proper nursing care			0
there are sufficient nurses across the @entity35 and we expect managers to ensure that staffing levels are sufficient to deliver an excellent standard of care at all times			0
' we are keeping the situation under review , but we currently believe health support workers can be effectively supervised by professionally qualified staff , and by experienced nurses			2
we expect care providers and employers to ensure proper performance management processes are in place , and that every effort is made to deliver safe , high quality care			0
