@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has defended @entity3 's decision to include @entity4 in his @entity6 squad			1
the former @entity8 under - 20s back - rower only moved to @entity9 last month and has yet to even feature for the capital club			1
the 22 - year - old has been included at the expense of former @entity14 skipper @entity13 and @entity16 flanker @entity15			1
@entity4 in action for the @entity18 at the @entity19 in @entity20 retired @entity23 international @entity21 and @entity24 both criticised the hurried inclusion of @entity4 , claiming it sent the wrong message to the nation 's juniors			1
but @entity0 insists there are plenty of home - grown youngsters receiving their chance to shine			2
the chief exec - who previously described himself as a ' pure - bred @entity36 ' - said : ' i do n't think it is sending the wrong message out to our youngsters			2
' it might have done had we not capped so many young @entity43 players over the last two years			1
' @entity44 is in the squad , so is @entity46 and @entity47			2
it is not as if we 've brought @entity4 in and no - one else is getting capped			1
' people should also not make the assumption that we have not been tracking @entity4			1
we 've been tracking him for ages			0
@entity23 coach @entity3 believes @entity4 can bring something ' special ' to the national squad ' we had him watched down in @entity8 making sure the progress is there and @entity3 believes this boy can bring something to the squad that we do n't have			1
' he has a special skill set that we do n't possess			0
' former newspaper advertising chief @entity0 caused a stir three years ago when he set out a list of ambitious targets for the @entity1 - including a @entity19 win in 2015			2
he repeated that aim just before last year 's @entity6 kicked - off - then watched as the @entity43 were humbled 20 - 0 by @entity64 and thrashed 51 - 3 by @entity65			1
but with this year 's championships just a fortnight away and the @entity19 in @entity64 another eight months down the road , @entity0 insists he does not regret setting the bar high			2
former @entity23 international @entity21 has criticised @entity3 's decision to include @entity4 in his squad ' i said before our aim is to win the @entity19 and i do n't walk away from that , ' said the 53 - year - old			1
' what i mean is that we have got to get this tanker pointing in the right direction			0
when i first came the expectation was so low , that people did not think we had the wherewithal to win anything			0
' they all said we could n't pay down debt , we could n't attract top coaches , that we could n't get our pro teams in a decent place , we could n't sell the naming rights for the stadium and we will never get blue - chip sponsors			2
' well since i 've come in we 've got @entity3 in as coach , we 've got @entity92 to sponsor @entity93 , we 've paid more debt down than we 've ever done before			1
' so all those things that people thought were impossible we have done			0
' we 've turned the ship around off the pitch , now we need to do it on it			0
our goal should be to win the @entity19			0
if we win it , then fantastic			0
veteran flankers @entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 have been left out of @entity3 's @entity6 squad ' if we do n't , but improve as a nation , then we are moving in the right direction and that was what it was all about			1
' so bad were @entity23 in last year 's @entity6 that there were calls from some pundits for the @entity14 to be kicked out of the tournament - or at least made to pre-qualify			1
but following an encouraging autumn test series in which the @entity43 pushed the world champion @entity8 close as well as beating @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity0 does not expect to face similar opposition to their involvement			1
' there was a lot of hysteria around last year and justifiably people were upset , ' he said			0
' but we had the perfect storm of things that went wrong			0
we had injuries , we had a pitch that for no fault of our own cut up badly and we did n't perform against @entity64 , which the @entity43 public wo n't tolerate			2
' but things were n't as bad as people portrayed			0
' there is always people jumping the @entity138 bandwagon down south , especially in a year with an independence vote			0
' it was all ill - informed nonsense			0
it was all a year after @entity142 finished bottom of the @entity6 and i did n't see a clamour of people asking them to pre-qualify			0

@entity4 only moved to @entity9 last month
the former @entity8 under - 20s flanker has yet to feature for his club
@entity43 veterans @entity13 and @entity15 has been *omitted* from @entity3 's squad
