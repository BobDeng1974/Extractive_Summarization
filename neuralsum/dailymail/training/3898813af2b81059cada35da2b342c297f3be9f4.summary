@entity1 congregate on @entity16 in @entity2 : around 800 people from @entity9 were arrested in the capital last month there now needs to be a ‘ concerted effort ’ by both agencies , he added , to identify and kick out the most dangerous criminals operating on @entity5 soil			1
mr @entity72 said : ‘ by definition , much of the information that would help us deal with these people more effectively is held in their home country			0
‘ it is only if people are here a long time and develop a criminal history that this gap is equalised			0
there is a capability issue that needs to be closed			0
’ a @entity48 study discovered that foreign national offenders are more likely to be cautioned and less likely to be prosecuted			0
