but if @entity6 was hoping for a better performance away from the office , he 'd better steer well clear of the @entity10 hall			2
when the chancellor was last there , he tried his hand at skipping with less than flattering consequences and was even upstaged by a group of primary school pupils			1
embarrassing footage has now emerged of that moment as he tied himself in knots trying to complete as many skips as possible in two minutes			1
he starts tentatively and within just a few seconds gets himself in one of many tangles as the children around continue merrily skipping with far more success			0
in the end , he manages just 48 skips , even fewer than 65 - year - old @entity42			1
other unflattering footage shows deputy prime minister @entity44 and shadow chancellor @entity45 taking part with a little more success			1
more than 100 are currently involved , with a league table showing the @entity50 's best performers			0
conservative mp @entity51 currently tops the list , with an impressive 348 skips in the designated time			1

disgraced former mp @entity68 is the worst performing mp , managing just 27			1
they were both outperformed by ms @entity42 , who posted a respectable score of 78 skips			1
in one of the videos , released to @entity74 , mr @entity44 says he is ' exhausted ' by the efforts			0
meanwhile shadow secretary of state for health @entity76 joked he would text mr @entity45 to taunt him when he beat his score of 138 by four			0

the attempts take place either at local primary schools , or at the houses of @entity105 themselves			2
mr @entity80 said he has been amazed at just how many mps have got involved			2
he said : ' obviously the point in this was to get the children fit			0
the mps have been brilliant over the years , yes they may look a little bit silly , but they 've nearly all been up for giving it a go to show the children how it 's done			0
' we 've had mps feel ill , fall over and get ultra competitive			0
when @entity76 did it he said he was going to text @entity45 to tell him he had beaten his score			0
' @entity42 got the rope and ran around the room with it before the music had even started , beating a lot of the men - even at her age			1

' @entity5 suffered its first - ever sovereign ratings downgrade from a major agency last friday when @entity149 's stripped the country of its coveted triple - a rating			0
it was a major blow to mr @entity6 , who had vowed to defend the @entity5 's credit status when the @entity154 came to power in 2010			2
