@entity6 , pictured , with @entity15 , from @entity7 claimed her cat has been hit with ' an animal asbo ' council officials accused @entity15 , pictured , of scratching and biting some of his neighbours ms @entity6 put a sign outside her back gate defending @entity15 , claiming that he is not a nasty cat under the terms of the notice , @entity15 is banned from leaving ms @entity6 ' house or she will have to pay any damage caused			1
the letter read : ' i am in receipt of several complaints regarding your cat @entity15 causing alarm , distress and annoyance to other residents in the area of your property			1
' although i appreciate that cats do roam , i would prefer if you could take steps to keep your cat @entity15 from leaving the perimeter of your garden in the future			1
' should further complaints be received about damage done to neighbours ’ property by your pet you will be charged for the repairs			2
' several residents confirmed that @entity15 would not leave their property if he jumped over a wall			2
ms @entity6 claimed : ' @entity15 does n’t like being touched on certain parts of his body but he is certainly not aggressive			1
' he has been accused of damaging property because he scratched a fence			0
' the council has said if he does any more damage i ’ll have to pay for it			0
' the only time he has bitten someone was when they pulled its tail			0
' i ’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control , but never a cat			0
' ms @entity6 , who is studying @entity78 and @entity79 at @entity80 described the entire process as ridiculous			1
ms @entity6 said the council 's instruction to lock @entity15 inside is cruel : he 's a cat and wants to be outside ' she said : ' it ’s just like an animal @entity86 , and it is completely ridiculous			1
' how can a cat behave antisocially ? it ’s an animal , it ’s a pet - he ’s not going to bite your leg off , drink alcohol in the street or try and rob your phone			0
' when ms @entity96 phoned @entity97 to ask about the specific complaints she was told that @entity15 had allegedly bitten two people , scratched an outside fence , and had intimidated residents by entering their homes and refusing to leave			1
she said : ' even if @entity15 did do these things , it ’s hardly what you ’d deem to be antisocial behaviour			1
' but where ’s the proof ? i have n’t seen a shred of proof that any of this even happened			0
i think the council need to concentrate on doing their job properly instead of following up rubbish like this			0
' the council told me to lock him indoors , but in this weather i think that ’s extremely cruel			2
he ’s a cat and wants to be outside			0
' i ’ve heard of people being told to keep their dog under control , but never a cat			0
' rocky the cat , who has been hit with an ' @entity86 ' is banned from roaming the streets of @entity7 council officials said they had received one formal complaint and two verbal complaints from residents on the @entity137 estate over the behaviour of four - year - old cat , @entity15			1
one resident , who did not wish to be named , said : ' @entity15 has bitten me on numerous occasions			2
' one time he came into my house through an upstairs window and started terrorising my dog			0
' i could hear him going mad and went up to see what the problem was and @entity15 was there			2
' when i tried to get him out the house he bit me extremely hard			0
' the neighbour added : ' i do n’t want to see @entity15 locked up , but i just want @entity6 to look after him properly because he can be vicious			1
' @entity6 asked @entity97 to provide evidence of her cat 's anti-social behaviour next door neighbour @entity152 , 65 , said : ' he comes over to our house quite a bit , but we do n’t have a problem with him			1
' he did bite me once , but that was because he got stuck and was frightened			0
@entity158 was very apologetic about it afterwards and i did n’t have a problem			0
' he ’s a male cat , and he needs to assert his authority , but he ’s not a bad cat really			0
' i certainly did n’t make a complaint about him			0
' @entity164 , @entity165 for @entity97 , denied the authority was being heavy - handed saying that it had a duty of care to neighbouring tenants , who have made one formal complaint and numerous verbal complaints about @entity15			1
he added : ' we do appreciate it is very difficult to control a cat once they are let out but @entity15 has been causing problems around the area for quite a while now and is actually terrifying some local residents who are very vulnerable			2
' last year he allegedly bit two people and his bad behaviour has continued because he causes both internal and external damage when he visits neighbouring properties			0
he certainly does not like being challenged and lives up to his boxing namesake !			0
' we have asked his owner to take reasonable steps to try and cut down his wandering and have advised the neighbours to use a variety of cat deterrents , which certainly includes not feeding him			1
' the warning letter is very much a last resort and if the owner takes reasonable steps to control him and we get no further reports from neighbouring residents then obviously this will go no further			2
' as part of their tenancy agreements all pet - owning council tenants must keep any animal at their property under proper control so that they do not cause a danger , nuisance or annoyance to their neighbours or anyone visiting the property or the locality			2
' this often refers to dogs but cats can also cause problems , as this case has illustrated			0
