by @entity0 published : 06:09 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 06:22 est , 6 june 2013 a state - of - the - art scanner that produces live @entity2 of a patient 's body during surgery has been used for the first time in an @entity8 hospital			1
the machine means that surgeons no longer have to rely on low - quality images taken prior to the operation			1
surgeons at the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) in @entity15 are using the £ 500,000 scanner to carry out complex spinal operations more efficiently and safely			1
the @entity19 imaging scanner is a revolutionary type of x-ray machine that can circulate 360 degrees around a patient in just 13 seconds to deliver live @entity23 and 3d images of a patient it allows the surgeon to manipulate images created by the scan so that they can view a variety of different @entity32 angles of the patient ’s anatomy , including detailed images of the spine and bone structure			1
it also allows for much higher resolution and quality images than existing intra-operative imaging			0
the @entity19 imaging scanner is a revolutionary type of x-ray machine that can circulate 360 degrees around a patient in just 13 seconds , resulting in both the radiographer and the surgeon having significantly less exposure to radiation			1
once the images are obtained the surgeons can use the hi - tech navigation technology to insert metalwork into the spine safely , significantly reducing the risk of injury to the spinal cord and nerves			2
the scanner can also provide traditional @entity59 ( pictured )			0
surgeons at the @entity14 in @entity15 are using the £ 500,000 scanner to carry out complex spinal operations more efficiently and safely the device is so accurate that it also reduces the chance that the surgeon will have to adjust the position of screws and rods after they have been inserted			1
the new technology will also help improve surgery for patients with complex spinal deformities and anatomy			0
mr @entity74 , @entity14 consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon , said : ‘ we are delighted to be able to have this brand new technology available to improve care for our patients			2
once the images are obtained , the surgeons can use the hi - tech navigation technology to insert metalwork into the spine safely , significantly reducing the risk of injury to the spinal cord and nerves ‘ this really is a breakthrough in medical technology that will make performing an operation much safer and easier			2
‘ @entity93 will be able to pinpoint exactly where surgical implants , such as metal screws , should be positioned along the spine , providing much greater accuracy and safety			0
‘ being able to perform procedures in this way will ultimately reduce the time needed for surgery especially for complex procedures – an added benefit being that patients will require less time under anaesthetic			0
‘ it allows less soft tissue disruption and the use of more minimal access techniques meaning faster rehabilitation for our patients			0

the £ 500,000 @entity19 scanner delivers high - quality @entity116 images
it is being used by surgeons at the @entity14
gives surgeons live x-ray images of patient during spinal surgery
can circulate around patient in 13 seconds meaning less radiation exposure
so accurate it reduces risk of patient suffering spinal injury during surgery
