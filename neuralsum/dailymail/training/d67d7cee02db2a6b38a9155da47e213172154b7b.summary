@entity6 said that his goal in life now , post-death , is to have fun and make other people 's lives better			1
@entity6 , who described himself as a life - long atheist , said that both times he experienced ' just black emptiness ' devoid of any thoughts ' no personal achievement will matter to me once i 'm dead , ' he told his fellow @entity4 users			1
' the only thing that will live on after my death will be my impact on the people that are still alive			2
' he revealed that dying twice has made it easier for him to cope with his mortality and accept the impending end as a given			2
‘ all you have to do is accept that death is what it is , a part of life , then you will understand that it is nothing to be afraid of , ’ he said			2
' once you 're dead , that 's it , it 's over			0
’ last july , @entity6 posted an online message telling friends that on june 25 , he was riding his motorcycle on a highway when he ran into a construction site , slammed on the brakes and lost control of his vehicle , suffering a broken knee , shin and ankle			1
according to @entity6 , his shattered body shut down from the intense pain , and for about two minutes he had no pulse , breathing or consciousness			1
@entity6 's second run - in with death came after a surgery			1
he claimed his body was in agony , so he took so many pain pills that his pulse plummeted to 10bpm and his respiratory system temporarily failed			0
‘ both times i was just " not there "			0
it was just all black			0
i would describe it as when you take a nap			0
a short nap with no dream , you wake up and it feels like you 've been sleeping a long time , when in reality it 's only been about 15 minutes , ’ he recounted			2
asked about what he felt the moment he died , the @entity4 interviewee revealed that it was like as if someone had flipped the on / off switch			1
he added that both experiences felt roughly the same , with the only difference being that in the bike accident he remembered the seconds before everything around him went to black			0
mr @entity6 also called into question the stories of other people who have reported being conscious during clinical death			1
' i think that in their cases , their minds were still active			0
what they experienced was just a sort of dream			0
' close call : @entity6 's first brush with death took place in june 2014 when he lost control of his bike and broke several bones			1
he says for two minutes , he had no pulse , breathing or consciousness in the aftermath of @entity6 ’s two close shaves , the college student said that he is no longer afraid to take risks in life - but he did give up on riding motorcycles for the sake of his family and friends			1
@entity6 told his fellow @entity140 that being at death ’s door before the age of 23 did nothing to change his views on @entity146 and religion			1
‘ i have always been an atheist , but i have always had a part of me that hoped there was a @entity146 or @entity151 or something greater than us , ’ he said			0
‘ i am still an atheist , and now i know that there is no such thing as @entity146 or @entity151			0
at least not for me			0
‘ he also expressed some strong views on the subject of organ donation , saying that he plans to give up his entire body to help other when his time finally comes			2
