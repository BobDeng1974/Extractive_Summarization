after decades of being without their treasured memento , the couple - both in their 80s - had given up all hope of ever seeing it again			2
but today , that all changed after the devoted couple were reunited with their long - lost photographs after the album was found in a rubbish skip			1

' i ca n’t believe it has come back after 61 years of marriage and the condition is not too bad at all , the photographs are still quite new			0
' the leather cover is a bit damaged but not bad considering how old it has and that it was found in a skip , you would think it would be ruined			2
' mr @entity24 and his 85 - year - old wife had not seen the wedding album since they somehow lost it in just weeks after their wedding			1
kind : the photo album was saved from a rubbish skip by a builder , @entity52 , 83 , who put the keepsake in his shed and vowed to find its rightful owners found : mr @entity52 's daughter @entity56 took on the job of attempting to find the album 's owners after the second world war veteran died last month			1
she sent pictures to a local paper , where relatives of @entity52 and mrs @entity3 recognised the couple , pictured the couple eventually moved from @entity65 to @entity66 in @entity67 thinking the album had been lost forever			1
excited : the long - lost pictures show how the couple could barely contain their happiness on their wedding day but incredibly , it was saved from a rubbish skip by a builder , @entity52 , 83 , who put the keepsake in his shed and vowed to find its rightful owners			1
in the end , it was his daughter @entity79 who took on the job after the second world war veteran died last month			0
