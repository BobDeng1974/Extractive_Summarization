by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:20 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 11:13 est , 4 december 2012 conservative party divisions over green energy widened today , after climate change minister @entity4 hailed wind farms as ‘ wonderful ’ and ‘ rather majestic ’			1
mr @entity4 appeared to take a swipe at his @entity8 colleague @entity7 , who has made plain his opposition to more turbines ‘ peppering ’ the countryside			1
the government is expected to commit to a major expansion in gas generation , with up to 30 new power stations in operation by 2030			0
@entity8 minister @entity4 joined @entity17 on the now famous 2006 trip to the @entity19 on the island of @entity21 inside the @entity22 @entity8 split : climate change minister @entity4 says wind farms can be ' majestic ' but energy minister @entity7 insists ' enough is enough ' and he does not want more peppering the countryside the move , due to be announced by @entity27 in tomorrow ’s @entity28 , has angered green campaigners who accuse the coalition of abandoning a promise to be the ‘ greenest government ever ’			1
mr @entity4 , who joined @entity17 on his infamous hug - a - huskie trip to the @entity34 in 2006 , insisted the pm was still committed to the environmental agenda			1
‘ the idea that the huskies have been put to sleep is nonsense , ’ he told the @entity37			1
‘ i have no doubt at all about the prime minister ’s green convictions			2
’ he added that unlike mr @entity7 he did not object to ‘ wonderful ’ wind turbines , and even claimed one near his @entity47 constituency had become ‘ almost a tourist attraction ’			1
mr @entity17 's @entity22 jaunt was seen as key to burnishing his credentials as opposition leader dozens of @entity8 mps have urged mr @entity17 to row back on green energy policies			1
mr @entity4 said : ‘ i understand the worries of these groups around specific sites , however that should n’t be seen as a rowing back to our wider commitment to the renewable agenda			1
’ however , mr @entity7 appeared to back the @entity8 rebels in an interview with the @entity66 in october when he signalled an end to new turbines , declaring ‘ enough is enough ’			2
he revealed he had commissioned research on the impact of wind turbines on the landscape and whether they drive down house prices			0
he has also asked scientists to examine noise complaints and more sinister suggestions that the turbines endanger military aircraft by blocking radar signals			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ the onshore wind debate is skewing the whole debate , which is not good for the government , not good for people and not good for the renewables lobby			2
‘ we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities			0
i ca n’t single - handedly build a new @entity89 but i can protect our green and pleasant land			0
‘ firstly , i have asked the planning minister to look again at the relationship between these turbines and the landscape			0
‘ it seems extraordinary to have allowed them to be peppered around the country without due regard for the interests of the local community or their wishes			0
‘ we have issued a call for evidence on wind			0
that is about cost but also about community buy - in			0
we need to understand communities ’ genuine desires			0
’ the comments sparked a furious row with his boss , @entity114 energy secretary @entity112 , who wrote to mr @entity17 warning mr @entity7 ’ continued presence in the department risked future legal challenges			1
but @entity118 did not respond , and in a list of ministerial responsibilities published last week , mr @entity7 was listed as having renewable energy in his brief .			2

climate change minister @entity4 also claims turbines in his @entity126 and @entity127 constituency are a ' tourist attraction '
comments are at odds with fellow conservative @entity7 , who has complained about wind farms ' peppering ' the countryside
mr @entity4 joined @entity17 on infamous 2006 @entity22 trip
he said the pm is still committed to being green , adding : ' the idea that the huskies have been put to sleep is nonsense '
