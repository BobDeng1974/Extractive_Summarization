she has wowed audiences with her high - energy dance routines and incredibly toned physique			1
and now @entity5 finalist @entity4 has revealed to @entity6 the secrets behind her incredible body - gallons of coconut water and lots of bottom exercises			1
' i ’m such a gym freak , ' confesses the 26 - year - old @entity13 , speaking from the contestants ' house			1
' i ’m usually in the gym five days a week			1
with a gruelling rehearsal schedule , @entity4 admits that gym time has fallen by the wayside but says , ' i 've been eating a lot healthier to compensate '			1
so what goes into her body to help her look so good ? ' i 've been hyper - conscious about staying away from rubbish			1
i do n’t eat white bread , white rice or cereal unless it ’s porridge			2
' but the finalist , who makes herself beans and eggs on toast for breakfast every morning , says crazy dieting is n't her style			1
' i would never totally deny myself any specific type of food			2
' ' i also love coconut water , ' @entity4 says			2
' i have it all through the day – it 's so hydrating and even better than water			2
' the moment @entity4 discovered the public had voted her through on saturday feeling emotional with fellow contestants @entity68 ( centre ) and @entity70 ( right ) she adds : ' every morning i take a dose of @entity72 too , which gives me an energy boost and is full of vitamin c. ' @entity4 's usual workout involves lots of exercise classes and running			1
' i do body conditioning , spinning and yoga , ' she says			2
' on the treadmill i ’ll do intervals of running flat and then on incline			2
i 'll do that for an hour			0
' i find the running is amazing for my abs. ' and what about that very toned derriere ? ' i do loads of squats with weights , ' she says			1
' it 's great for your bum and legs			1
' on saturday night , the @entity5 front - runner received rave reviews from the judges and subsequently on social media for her high - octane performance of @entity24 , a track from @entity105 's upcoming album , and admits she felt something special in the studio			1
' it was incredible – i never expected this kind of reaction , ' she admits			0
' it 's the first time i ’ve ever felt anything like that from the audience			0
as soon as i stepped up there , the roar in that room – wow			0
i kept telling myself just enjoy it			0
' ' for my @entity121 performance i was originally wearing a massive hat ( pictured left during rehearsals ) , but @entity124 took one look and said , " hmmm , i do n’t like that hat " , so i lost it '			1
pictured right during the live shows but @entity4 says : ' i ’m not going to lie			0
initially when @entity124 suggested changing the song , i thought , " this is a huge risk "			1
@entity124 suggested i take five minutes to think about it and call him back			1
' i was standing on the street outside the rehearsal and i was waiting for a sign			0
then suddenly from nowhere i heard this funk song playing - and i thought i have to go for it			1
' when i went back into the rehearsal room and told the music team i was going for it , they all cheered			0
i only had friday afternoon to learn the dance routine but i decided not to stress and enjoy it			0
' the decision paid off as @entity4 sailed straight through to the finals on sunday 's results show			0
the black and gold gettup was also her favourite outfit of the competition			0
' i was comfortable and i thought it was sexy but classy - and i loved the gold jacket and gold jewellery			2
' @entity4 describes her style as ' street chic ' and loves gold jewellery ( left ) and patterned leggings ( right ) over the past eight weeks , the finalist has appeared on stage in shiny bodycon dresses , leather catsuits , eeny weeny shorts and mega heels - but says she 's lapped up every minute of playing dress - up			1
even @entity124 has got involved in the style stakes			1
' for my @entity121 performance two weeks ago i was originally wearing a massive hat			0
but @entity124 took one look and said , " hmmm , i do n’t like that hat " , so i lost it			1
' one thing @entity124 always comments on is my hair			1
whenever i wear it natural , he always says , " i like your hair like that , you should always wear like that "			0
' but behind the scenes there 's a man even more influential than @entity124 in @entity4 's life - her @entity176 fashion designer boyfriend @entity174 , who has previously dressed the likes of @entity178 and @entity179			1
' he knows me best , ' @entity4 says			0
' he knows what i ’m comfortable with and gives me great advice			2
sometimes he ’ll send me an image of something he likes and i ’ll try to put together something similar			0
' he also helped me plan my audition outfit			0
he said , " you need to stand out " and found this colourful jacket for me online			0
the judges first comments were , " wow - do you always dress like that ? " ' @entity4 has turned heads in the style stakes , showing she can do casual ( left ) and super glamorous ( right ) so does she ? ' no way ! when i 'm off stage , i ’ll mix high fashion and normal high street for a " street chic " look			1
i ’ll wear white skinny jeans , a pair of heels and a leather jacket or i 'll match patterned leggings with a long coat			0
' i always accessorise with gold jewellery too - i wear gold hoops and my gold @entity209			2
' with the finals just one week away , the stylish contestant says she 's been waiting a lifetime for this moment to arrive			0
breakfast : scrambled eggs and beans on a slice of brown toast lunch : chicken with salad and vegetables dinner : fish and brown rice snack : dried fruit and nuts ' i 've had times when i 've been sitting at home and nothing happening , ' she explains			1
' i was at a really low point at the beginning of this year and was considering giving up and getting a regular job			2
i thought , " i ’m 26 years old			2
if it was going to happen , it would have happened by now "			0
' i would make little videos and demos and hope the right person would see it but when nothing happens , it ’s really demoralising			0
' i used to do a lot of backing singing - especially for @entity243 fresh – but i 'd just be wishing that one day it would be me			2
' on saturday night , @entity5 viewers will decide whether @entity4 will finally have the chance to take that talent all the way to the recording studio			0
