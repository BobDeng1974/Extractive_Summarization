the bodies of 21 @entity2 soldiers entombed in a perfectly preserved @entity4 shelter have been discovered 94 years after they were killed			2
the men were part of a larger group of 34 who were buried alive when a huge @entity10 shell exploded above the tunnel in 1918 , causing it to cave in			1
thirteen bodies were recovered from the underground shelter , but the remaining men had to be left under a mountain of mud as it was too dangerous to retrieve them			2
nearly a century later , @entity22 archaeologists stumbled upon the mass grave on the former @entity24 in eastern @entity22 during excavation work for a road building project			1
@entity27 : the bodies of 21 @entity2 soldiers entombed in a perfectly preserved @entity4 shelter have been discovered in @entity22 94 years after they were killed amazing condition : the soldiers were buried alive in mud inside the underground shelter ( left ) which contained items including beds , a bottle and a helmet ( right ) some 7.5million men lost their lives on the @entity24 during @entity4			1
the front was opened when the @entity2 army invaded @entity41 and @entity42 in 1914 and then moved into the industrial regions in northern @entity22			1
in september of that year , this advance was halted , and slightly reversed , at the @entity45			0
it was then that both sides dug vast networks of trenches that ran all the way from the @entity51 to the @entity53 border with @entity22			2
this line of tunnels remained unaltered , give or take a mile here and a mile there , for most of the four - year conflict			0
by 1917 , after years of deadlock that saw millions of soldiers killed for zero gain on either side , new military technology including poison gas , tanks and planes was deployed on the front			2
thanks to these techniques , the @entity10 slowly advanced throughout 1918 until the war 's end in november			1
many of the skeletal remains were found in the same positions the men had been in at the time of the collapse , prompting experts to liken the scene to @entity80			1
a number of the soldiers were discovered sitting upright on a bench , one was lying in his bed and another was in the foetal position having been thrown down a flight of stairs			0
as well as the bodies , poignant personal effects such as boots , helmets , weapons , wine bottles , spectacles , wallets , pipes , cigarette cases and pocket books were also found			2
even the skeleton of a goat was found , assumed to be a source of fresh milk for the soldiers			0
archaeologists believe the items have been so well - preserved because hardly any air , water or lights had penetrated the trench			0
the 300ft - long tunnel was located 18ft beneath the surface near the small town of @entity114 in the @entity116 region of @entity22			1
@entity117 , the archaeologist leading the dig , said : ' it 's a bit like @entity80			2
everything collapsed in seconds and is just the way it was at the time			0
' here , as in @entity80 , we found the bodies as they were at the moment of their death			1
some of the men were found in sitting positions on a bench , others lying down			1
one was projected down a flight of wooden stairs and was found in a foetal position			0
' the collapsed shelter was filled with soil			0
the items were very well - preserved because of the absence of air and light and water			0
' @entity148 objects were rusty , wood was in good condition and we found some pages of newspapers that were still readable			0
leather was in good condition as well , still supple			0
' the items will be taken to a laboratory , cleaned and examined			0
' network of tunnels : @entity22 engineers stumbled upon the mass grave on the former @entity24 near the town of @entity114 in the @entity116 region of eastern @entity22 during excavation work for a road building project a drinks cup and the remains of a rifle that have survived almost intact for a century			1
archaeologists believe the items have been so well - preserved because hardly any air , water or lights penetrated the trench stuck in time : a @entity2 newspaper from 1918 lies partly preserved inside the shelter building tool : a large hammer ( left ) that archaeologists believe was used to help dig the trench network ( right ) archaeologists also uncovered the wooden sides , floors and stairways of the shelter			1
the dead soldiers were part of the 6th @entity186 , 94th @entity187			0
their names are all known - they include @entity189 , 20 , private @entity190 , 22 , and lieutenant august @entity191 , 37 , whose names are inscribed on a memorial in the nearby @entity2 war cemetery of @entity195			0
the bodies have been handed over to the @entity198 but unless relatives can be found and they request the remains to be repatriated , it is planned that the men will be buried at @entity195			1
the underground tunnel was big enough to shelter 500 men and had 16 exits			2
it would have been equipped with heating , telephone connections , electricity , beds and a pipe to pump out water			0
the @entity22 attacked the shelter on march 18 , 1918 with aerial mines that penetrated the ground and blasted in the side wall of the shelter in two points			1
it is estimated that over 165,000 @entity220 soldiers are still unaccounted for on the @entity24			0
