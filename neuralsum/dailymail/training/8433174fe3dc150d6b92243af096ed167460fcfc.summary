by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor town halls could be legally forced to empty black bins every week , under plans being considered by the @entity5			1
the move follows revelations that more than five million families have lost weekly bin collections since the government came to power - despite a pledge to stop the slide to fortnightly pick ups			1
under proposals being considered by local government secretary @entity16 councils will be required to meet a ' minimum service standard ' when it comes to waste collection			2
local government secretary @entity16 has called weekly bin collections a ' funadamental right ' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in @entity23 ministers have decided to act after a series of measures designed to stop councils axing weekly collections failed			1
half of councils have switched to fortnightly collections - rejecting a £ 250million @entity10 bribe introduced in 2012 to encourage them to maintain their weekly service			1
and earlier this year mr @entity16 issued a ' bin bible ' to try to stop councils from axing weekly rubbish collections			2
the @entity40 communities secretary said the guidance - issued to all local authorities - exposed the false claims made by council ' bin barons ' to justify scaling back services			0
and two years ago , mr @entity16 even claimed that having bins emptied once a week was a ‘ fundamental right '			2
but cutbacks to the service have accelerated under his watch			0
at least 60 councils have introduced a fortnightly waste collection since may 2010			2
by the time of the election next year , 18.5million families will have lost weekly bin rounds			1
mr @entity16 has now decided to force councils to change their policy by making it a legal requirement to collect people 's black bins every week , according to the @entity63			1
the @entity64 said : ' the @entity65 @entity10 will continue to standing up for hard working people who deserve a decent bin service			0
' one option being considered by the @entity40 is the introduction of a minimum service standard , which would reinstate the previous legal requirement for councils to collect rubbish weekly			1
' @entity74 , the founder of the @entity75 , said : ' this news is most welcome and our campaign members will be delighted			0
' as councils are now seeking to reduce general refuse collections to once every three or four weeks , legislation is obviously necessary to prevent them from doing so			0
weekly collections are essential , especially in summer months			0
' but @entity85 's shadow local government secretary @entity84 said : ' @entity16 has already announced that he wants to bring back weekly collections and he has totally failed to do so while wasting a quarter of a billion pounds of taxpayers money in the process			2
' he should let local councils work out what works best for their residents and stop trying to tell them what to do , especially when it would be more expensive for council tax payers			0
' a spokesman for the @entity97 added : ' our own polling shows the vast majority - about 80 per cent - of people are happy with the way their bins are collected			0
' satisfaction rates are broadly the same regardless of whether people have weekly or alternate weekly collections			0
' @entity16 is considering making it a legal requirement for councils to collect black bin bags every week			1

@entity16 wants to introduce legal requirement to collect black bins weekly
new rule will only be introduced if @entity5 *win* the next election
moves to encourage councils to drop fortnightly collections have failed
more than five million families have lost weekly collection since 2010
