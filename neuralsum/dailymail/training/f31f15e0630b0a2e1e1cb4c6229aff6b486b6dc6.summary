a shady online marketplace that anonymously sold drugs and guns has virtually disappeared , leaving illegal vendors believing they ’ve been scammed out of as much as $ 100 million			1
@entity4 emerged as the go - to replacement to @entity6 , a similar bazaar shuttered by the @entity8 in october			1
now users of the site , which operated outside the law to begin with and dealt only in anonymous @entity12 , fear it was a scam all along			1
fleeced : an illicit online bazaar where drugs , guns , and even hit men could be purchased went offline sunday			2
now its vendors and users fear they 've been bilked out of as much as $ 100 million , all in anonymous @entity12 through what may have been a scam website shielded from authorities and using special software to access the so - called ‘ deep web ’ site , buyers could find drugs , guns , and even hit men			1
buyers would put their @entity12 into the marketplace , where sellers would withdraw them , with all the transactions moderated by the website			1
which is where the issue first arose			0
in the days before the site shut down , vendors suddenly found themselves unable to access the @entity12 tied up in the site ’s wallet			1
down , but is it out ? @entity4 posted a note claiming it was they who were the victims of a scam			2
but users have their doubts and fear no one will ever get refunds of their nearly untraceable , illicit money as they complained , reports @entity50 , they found their comments suddenly yanked from the site ’s forums			2
buyers also began to see suspicious things in the time leading up to this possible scam			0
some vendors , though not all , began to list their drugs and other goods at prices far lower than ever before			2
now , many believe they were being bilked out of as many of their @entity12 — a difficult to trace form of online currency currently worth over $ 1,000 a piece — as possible before taking the money and running			1
on sunday , visitors to the site found a note in place of the homepage that claimed a vendor called @entity72 had stolen from the site ’s cache of @entity12			1
shoddy replacement ? the illegal bazaar rose to prominence after @entity6 was shut down by the @entity8 in october			1
while other marketplaces exist , users must now fear that each one is a scam like @entity4 appears to have been ‘ this vendor found bug in system and stole 5400 @entity12 , ’ reads the brief note			1
‘ your money , our provisions , all was stolen			0
’ however , according to a post on @entity92 , a wallet of far more @entity12 has been traced back to the site			1
@entity94 - short for @entity94 - is a seething matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity			2
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption to render users anonymous online			2
normally , file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user 's unique ip address that can be traced back to an individual computer			1
the @entity94 on the @entity111 hides the ip address and the activity of the user			0
most of the @entity117 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines - sites or pages do n't exist until created as the result of a specific search			0
an internet search is like dragging a net across the surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught , but a majority is deep and therefore missed			0
valued at $ 45 million , 39,918 in @entity12 could now be in the hands of a those behind the site after scamming untold numbers of hopeful drug users and gun toters out of their hard earned virtual cash			1
according to the @entity139 , one @entity138 claims to have engaged in a virtual chase with @entity142 computer programmer @entity141 , who user sheeproadreloaded2 claims is behind the site and has absconded with 96,000 bitcoins , or about $ 95 million dollars			1
despite a claim by @entity4 that they intend to refund users ’ money to their ‘ emergency addresses , ’ none of the commenters on @entity149 ’s r / @entity148 forum appear to have received any money thus far			1
some , however , do seem to be seriously worried their money will never come			0
a commenter using the handle wrote : ‘ i am a large vendor on @entity4 , or i was until recently			2
i sold hard drugs in reasonably large quantities			0
i have around $ 90k locked up in the site			2
i owe some money to some very nasty people , ‘ i have until monday evening			0
they have already threatened me with death			0
i have no doubt that they have killed before ... i am 26 and i do n't want to die			0
’ whether this is a true story or not remains unclear			0
however , with no way to track what illicit money belongs to whom , it seems clear that no one will be getting their @entity12 back even if the alleged thief ever gets caught			1
bitcoins are a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa			0
the main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap , anonymous transactions policed by its community of users			0
much like gold , there are a finite number of @entity12 - 21 million exist and are predicted to last until 2140			1
this number was designated by the inventor ( or inventors ) of the virtual coinage when it first came about in 2008			0
also like gold , @entity12 are mined			0
but instead of digging in the ground , @entity12 are extracted online via complex algorithms like virtual pickaxes			0
the value of @entity12 fluctuate like gold , too .			0

@entity4 , an anonymous marketplace accessible only with the help of software that hides its users ' *identities* , virtually vanished sunday taking its vendors ' money with it
@entity4 became the go - to ' dark web ' site for drugs , illegal arms , and other shady deals after @entity6 was *famously* shuttered by the @entity8 in october
the site claimed they *'d* been *hacked* but cache of 96,000 @entity12 , the *equivalent* to nearly $ 100 million , has been traced back to the site
