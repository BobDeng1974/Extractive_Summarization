by @entity0 published : 05:31 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 06:17 est , 10 october 2012 invention : the top of one of @entity5 's thermometers that has been in a private collection for 40 years one of the original thermometers made by @entity5 has sold for more than £ 67,000			1
the 300 - year - old brass instrument is one of only three known examples of @entity5 ’s work in existence today			1
it was thought to have been lost to history until it emerged for sale at @entity18 in @entity19 having been in private ownership for more than 40 years			1
the 4.5ins tall item got bidders hot under the collar when it went under the hammer , eventually going to an anonymous telephone buyer who paid £ 67,250 for it			0
@entity5 invented the mercury thermometer in 1714 , but it is unknown exactly how many he made			1
it divided the freezing and boiling points of water into 180 degrees			0
32 ° @entity33 was the freezing point of water and 212 ° @entity33 was the boiling point of water , set by @entity5 himself			1
0 ° f was based on the temperature of an equal mixture of water , ice , and salt			0
@entity5 based his scale on the temperature of the human body			1
the fahrenheit scale was the first widely used temperature scale			0
his other great invention was the fahrenheit scale that is still used today , and which the thermometer is annotated with			2
@entity5 was born in @entity52 , in the @entity53 , into a @entity56 @entity55 merchant family			1
his parents died from mushroom poisoning when he was just 15 , and he later moved to the @entity59 where he spent the rest of his life			0
he began training as a chemist , and his personal interest in natural science led to his studies and experimentation in the field			0
they culminated in his inventing the alcohol thermometer , for which he mastered glass blowing , and then the mercury version			1
the scale on the newly - discovered thermometer is marked from ' 0 ' to ' 132 ' degrees @entity33 and it is so small that the numbers had to be written on both sides of the mercury tube			1
the device is signed ' @entity81 ' , from the time the inventor worked in @entity83 , where he made it			2
signed by the inventor : he has marked the thermometer with ' @entity81 ' , short for @entity83 , where he made it great inventor : @entity5 had a strong interest in natural science and was fascinated by new inventions this example has been in a private collection for over 40 years and it was unknown to scientific historians until now			1
@entity95 , from auctioneers @entity18 , said in august when the auction was announced : ' until now , only two originals were thought to exist			2
' and these are both in the @entity99 in the @entity100			0
' so to have this one emerge is very exciting			0
' it is impossible to pinpoint exactly when it was made , but one in the museum is dated 1718 , and this was probably made between 1715 and 1730			2
' he made barometers with thermometers on the side , but this was one was a special scientific thermometer			1
' it is only 4.5 inches long and is made of brass and has the @entity116 scale down the sides			2
' the mercury tube is not the original and has been replaced , but it was clearly designed so the tubes could be taken out			2
' it was a thermometer for scientific purposes perhaps for measuring the temperature of liquids			2
' originally it was probably owned by a great scientist of the day			0
' @entity127 ( pictured ) whom @entity5 visited in 1708 and then improved on his scale , the result being the fahrenheit temperature scale @entity5 was born in @entity52 , in the @entity53 , into a @entity56 merchant family in 1686			1
he began training as a merchant in @entity83 after his parents died on august 14 , 1701 , when he was just 15 , from eating poisonous mushrooms			0
he later moved to the @entity59 where he spent the rest of his life and married @entity137 , daughter of a well - known business family			0
however , @entity5 had a strong interest in natural science and was fascinated by new inventions such as the thermometer			1
he began training as a chemist , and his personal interest in natural science led to his studies and experimentation in the field			0
in 1717 , @entity5 became a glassblower , making barometers , altimeters , and thermometers			1
from 1718 onwards , he was a lecturer in chemistry			0
he visited @entity154 in 1724 and was the same year elected a @entity155			0
his interests culminated in him inventing the alcohol thermometer , for which he mastered glass blowing , and then the mercury version			1
the mercury thermometer , with a standardised @entity116 scale , was invented in 1714			1
the fahrenheit scale was the first widely used temperature scale			0
it divided the freezing and boiling points of water into 180 degrees			0
32 ° @entity33 was the freezing point of water and 212 ° @entity33 was the boiling point of water , set by @entity5 himself			1
0 ° f was based on the temperature of an equal mixture of water , ice , and salt			0
@entity5 based his scale on the temperature of the human body			1
originally , the human body temperature was 100 ° f on the @entity116 scale , but it has since been adjusted to 98.6 ° @entity184 the thermometer was inspired by @entity127 , a @entity186 astronomer , in @entity187			2
@entity127 had invented a wine thermometer			1
@entity127 's thermometer had two points , 60 degrees as the temperature of boiling water and 7.5 degrees as the temperature of melting ice			2
at that time , temperature scales were not standardised and everybody made up their own scale			2
@entity5 modified @entity127 's design and scale , and thus , invented the new mercury thermometer with a @entity116 scale			1
@entity5 died in the @entity202 in 1736 and was buried there at the @entity203			1
after his death , in 1742 , the celsius scale was invented by @entity207 astronomer @entity206			0
also known as the ' centigrade ' scale , centigrade means ' consisting of or divided into 100 degrees			0
' the celsius scale has 100 degrees between the freezing point ( 0 ° c ) and boiling point ( 100 ° c ) of pure water at sea level air pressure			0
the term ' celsius ' was adopted in 1948 by an international conference on weights and measurements			0
the simplicity of the celsius scale led to it superseding the @entity116 as the universal temperature scale .			0

it was thought to have been lost to history but has been in private ownership for more than 40 years
@entity5 invented the mercury thermometer in 1714 , but it is unknown exactly how many he made
