police have vowed to spend another two years tracking down the rioters and looters who ransacked @entity4 's streets			1
those who thought they had escaped the law by now should not rest easy as police have pledged to trawl through 40,0000 hours of @entity9 footage in a bid to bring every single person involved to justice			1
officers have promised to pursue each offender they can identify , the @entity13 reported			2
police are determined to track down every single suspect , and have resorted to using big screens , like this one outside the @entity18 in @entity19 , as part of their investigation but it is anticipated that some of the more difficult cases will take years to complete			1
@entity26 say that so far 2,006 people have been arrested in connection with the rioting and looting			2
of those 1,135 have been charged , with 954 of those cases appearing before a court , 82 have been sentenced and 42 have been jailed			2
but the investigation is far from over , as police are determined to use every scrap of evidence they can find from @entity9 , which has been heavily criticised as being unnecessarily intrusive and imposing a ' @entity39 ' watch on society			1
police are seizing the opportunity to showcase just how effective the surveillance cameras can be in helping to combat crime			1
already they have set up dedicated websites filled with @entity9 images of suspects ' images , using social media websites including @entity50 to encourage people to view the pictures and ' shop a looter '			1
police are not daunted by the hours of @entity9 they will have to trawl through , or suspects ' attempts to disguise themselves , as they vow to hunt down every rioter and looter they have broadcast @entity9 images and video on huge billboards and used vans with screens attached to publish footage			1
police say their campaign to catch those involved has been overwhelmed by members of the public who have eagerly come forward to inform them of suspects			1
the @entity13 reported dedicated officers are ploughing through 10,000 hours of @entity9 material while cameras in the @entity18 in @entity19 have 743 hours of material			1
detective chief inspector @entity74 , of @entity34 , told the newspaper they would not rest until they had searched every avenue to identify offenders			1
and detective chief inspector @entity81 , from the @entity80 's riot investigation , @entity78 , told the newspaper harnessing the power of @entity9 was crucial			1
' there is a wider debate about @entity9 but in this investigation it is absolutely core , it 's critical			1
' we 're looking at footage where people have made little or no effort to disguise their faces			2
' sometimes they pulled up a scarf or a hood just before they go into a looted shop , then 50 metres down the road they take it off again , or they 'll get into a car with the registration number clearly visible			2
' crackdown : @entity104 , left , and @entity105 , right , have already been tracked down and jailed			0
@entity106 was punished for inciting violence on @entity108 , while @entity105 was imprisoned for taking a lick of stolen ice cream already the police have shown just how determined they are to track all of the rioters and looters down			1
a teenager who used @entity108 to encourage the ' killing of a million police officers ' during the riots has been jailed for 33 months			1
@entity106 incited his 2,000 friends on the site to commit violence and looting in @entity122			0
he asked if any of them ' wanted anything ' from a fashion store that was later targeted			0
the jobless 18 - year - old posted three messages on his @entity108 ' wall ' on august 9 , hours before serious disorder broke out in his home city			1
the first two read ' @entity130 whose onit ? ' and ' kill one black youth , we kill a million @entity135 ( police ) , riot til we own cities '			2
it is believed the second message was a reference to @entity141 , whose death in @entity144 sparked the original trouble			0
in his third message , @entity106 wrote : ' rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from ( fashion chain ) @entity150 ? ' the store , in @entity152 , had its windows smashed hours later			2
@entity106 had pleaded guilty to a breach of section 44 of the @entity156 , doing an act which was capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence , namely violent disorder			0
judge @entity161 told @entity106 that his comments ' encouraged attacks on the people of @entity122 as a whole , and the people of other cities			0
' upmarket shop : @entity105 walked into this @entity169 in @entity170 and helped himself to a cone and two scoops of ice cream sentencing the teenager to two years and nine months in a young offenders ' institution , he added : ' your offence was designed to , and could well have led to , increased numbers on the street intent on violence to persons and property			2
' an element of deterrence is called for in cases like this			0
a clear signal needs to be sent out that criminal conduct of the kind demonstrated in these cases is out of order and will not be brushed under the carpet			0
' his sentence came as a looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months			0
@entity105 , 21 , wandered into an upmarket store in central @entity170 after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops			0
but despite giving it to a passer - by because he did n't like the coffee flavour he was still given a lengthy prison term			0
the sentence will fuel fears that courts are meting out disproportionate justice to those caught up in the disorder			0
yesterday @entity170 @entity214 was told that ice cream thief @entity105 , 21 , was arrested after raiding @entity169 because he left dna behind at the scene			0
he admitted burglary and an unconnected charge of handling a stolen vacuum cleaner after his arrest			0
the court heard that @entity105 had already appeared in court charged with possessing drugs and an offensive weapon on the same day he got mixed up in the disorder			0
@entity227 , defending , said : ' he is remorseful and fully accepts how serious the matter was and why courts take such a serious view of this type of behaviour			0

*metropolitan* police have 40,000 hours worth of @entity9 to trawl through
*exhaustive* search to track down suspects could take years as police vow to ' search every avenue '
