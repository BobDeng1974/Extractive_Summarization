a 22 st actress has lost eight stone after fearing her frame would hold her back from being cast as @entity3			1
@entity4 , 34 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , has slimmed to an incredible size 12 so she can slip into floaty dresses and wings for her dream role in the @entity12 pantomime			1
and now the impish star , who is part of amateur drama group @entity15 , is set to star as the fairy this december			2
the events manager said : ' i knew that it might be a struggle to convince directors that i was fitting to be cast as fairy when i was stomping around on the stage			1
' now i 've never felt or looked better and i 'm a much better fit for the @entity3 costume ! ' for years , @entity4 had been consigned to roles for women many years her senior			1
her extra pounds meant she could n't pass for characters her own age and she ended up masquerading as the @entity36 in @entity37 and the @entity38 in @entity39 and @entity40			0
desperate to prove that she had the looks as well as the voice to match the character , @entity4 began an impressive diet focussed on curbing carbs			1
@entity47 said at 22 st it might be a struggle to convince directors that she was fitting to be cast as fairy she used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops she went from indulging in multipacks of sweets and crisps every single day to not touching carbohydrates at all and ditching sugary snacks			1
@entity4 also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out , riding , and tending for horses at her local stables			2
her husband is also delighted with her achievement			0
she said : ' i used to struggle to fit into public toilets and fitting rooms in shops - it was so embarrassing			2
' if someone had parked too close to me in a car park i risked getting stuck and found myself climbing in over the passenger side			0
' i knew i had to take action especially because there were some roles that i had n't got because of my size			0
' despite my weight i was getting strong roles and my singing voice was strong			0
but when i was a lot heavier i looked a lot older , so i ended up playing women who are meant to be twice my age			0
' i can dance without being out of breath and run around the stage without worrying about putting my foot through a board			0
' i look back and think , " how can i have let myself get that way ? " @entity4 also returned to horse riding and now spends hours every week mucking out and riding when she was heavier she looked older so ended up playing women twice her age @entity4 said : ' i 've done every diet under the sun - @entity92 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , even the cabbage soup diet - but never had much lasting success			1
' now i 've managed to the simplest thing in the world , just cutting out carbs and exercising more , and it 's worked			2
' i see people squeezing between cars in car parks or struggling to find clothes to fit and i think ' that used to be me '			0
' now i 'm the best i 've ever looked and feel fantastic			0
' breakfast : two cups of coffee lunch : two doorstep sandwiches with mayo , sweets , crisps , cake and a chocolate bar dinner : large bowl of pasta with cheese cream sauce and extra cheese snacks : @entity123 , chocolate , packet biscuits , large slice of cake breakfast : two low fat sausages with one egg lunch : chicken salad with a piece of fruit or yoghurt dinner : beef stir fry with zero carbohydrate noodles snacks : a handful of nuts @entity4 has done every diet under the sun but by cutting carbs and exercising she looks better than ever @entity4 , after losing 8 stone , can now slip into floaty dresses and wings for role of @entity12 's fairy friend			1
