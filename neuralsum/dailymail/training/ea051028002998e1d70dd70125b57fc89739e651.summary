significant blow : @entity1 , pictured in @entity2 , had tried to take the sting out of the vote more than 100 conservative mps condemned the government last night for not bringing forward an @entity8 referendum @entity9			1
a total of 130 mps , including 12 @entity13 rebels and @entity15 members , backed an unprecedented motion expressing ' regret ' that last week 's @entity18 did not include legislation paving the way for a referendum			1
in all , 114 @entity22 – more than half the party 's backbenchers and one in three of its mps – backed the amendment			0
ministers abstained on the issue , in which @entity31 backbenchers were allowed a free vote			1
the vote was the most significant on @entity35 since october 2011 , when 81 @entity26 revolted in a bid to call for an in / out referendum			0
@entity39 @entity38 , one of the leaders of last night 's revolt , said @entity26 had simply voted to reinforce the @entity31 's position and claimed @entity13 would now have to make its position clear			1
but the scale of the @entity31 rebellion was a significant blow for @entity1 , who had tried on tuesday to take the sting out of the vote by unveiling draft legislation , to be adopted by a @entity31 mp and backed by the leadership as a @entity51			1
the @entity52 have refused to countenance a @entity9 , arguing that talk of an @entity8 referendum in 2017 is causing uncertainty for business leaders			0
the prime minister , on a visit to the @entity68 , accused both mr @entity60 and @entity13 leader @entity70 of ' burying their heads in the sand ' over @entity35 and defended his handling of the referendum debate			1
speaking in @entity2 he said his pledge to hold an in / out referendum by december 31 , 2017 , was a ' very clear , popular and right position which is in the national interest '			0
he added : ' the other parties have got to make their mind up			0
' in the @entity82 , mr @entity60 was condemned as a ' hypocrite ' by @entity26 having promised an in / out referendum on the @entity85 , the last major transfer of powers from @entity87 to @entity88 , when it was signed by @entity89			2
rebels : @entity1 's three - day trip to the @entity68 has been over-shadowed by @entity31 infighting over @entity35 the deputy prime minister dismissed @entity31 calls for the @entity52 to allow a @entity95 paving the way for a vote on remaining in the @entity8 , which mr @entity1 has vowed to hold if he wins the next election			1
' get me out of here ' : @entity101 declared she wants to stand on a joint ticket with @entity103 mr @entity60 insisted the @entity104 had already legislated to guarantee a referendum if there was a significant transfer of powers to @entity88			1
but he then went further , suggesting that an in / out referendum was inevitable : ' by the way i think it 's a question of when , not if , because the rules are bound to change			0
' aides suggested later that mr @entity60 believed an in / out referendum would have to be held when countries in the eurozone agreed a new treaty to allow them to integrate more closely , even if that meant no new powers being transferred from @entity87 to the @entity8			2
however , mr @entity1 accused the other party leaders of trying to ignore the fundamental changes going on in the @entity8			2
' the single currency is driving a massive process of change in @entity35 and so as a result @entity87 needs to get its stance with respect to this massive change right , ' he said			0
' there are various responses you can make – sticking your head in the sand and pretending nothing has changed and just carrying on and accepting everything that comes out of @entity88			0
' this is not a sensible approach - although it does seem to be the approach some in @entity87 politics seem to take – or you can say @entity35 is changing , @entity87 needs to be a part of forging that change			0
' just as the eurozone countries come together and do more things together , so those countries outside the eurozone need to work out how they 're going to make their relationship work with @entity35			0
rebel : conservative @entity101 said it is ' important that the @entity146 unites ' over @entity35 ' it makes sense at the end of that to give @entity87 people the proper choice , which is not just do you back this new treaty , but do you back @entity87 being in this reformed organisation or coming out of it ? ' mr @entity1 dismissed talk of a ' rebellion ' in the @entity82 , pointing out it was a free vote			1
@entity159 hailed the draft legislation on an @entity8 referendum			0
he said : ' @entity13 can not answer the simple question : do they rule out offering an in / out referendum ? ' @entity31 grandee @entity165 said : ' i 've been arguing for a referendum for 20 years			2
only yesterday our prime minister became the first party leader to actually draw up a real @entity171			1
' this is not just a paper promise , the sort of thing that @entity60 wriggles out of			2
' but at a meeting of conservative mps , foreign secretary @entity176 was urged by arch - @entity179 to hold an @entity8 referendum before 2017			1
