' animated : @entity0 wags a finger at @entity1 , who appears to have a clenched fist , on the @entity9 this morning			1

but today , mr @entity0 insisted that @entity19 could not take power without the support of the @entity44 , and claimed the prospect was ' actually deeply alarming '			1
he said mr @entity1 would have to take help from the @entity51 party ' crouching on his back like a monkey ' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole @entity56			1
the @entity8 mayor added : i am not saying that your brother had to present himself at @entity61 with a dagger in his back ... [ but ] he [ @entity1 ] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother , and that is the key point			1
' verbal onslaught : mr @entity0 said that @entity19 could not take power without the support of the @entity44 time to go : mr @entity0 and mr @entity1 leave the politics programme after their massive on - air argument mr @entity1 arrived at the @entity10 studios in @entity8 by car , while mr @entity0 cycled there @entity1 won the @entity19 leadership in september 2010 by narrowly beating his brother @entity17 , who had been the runaway favourite for the top job			1

' mr @entity0 insisted the @entity29 attacks on the @entity44 were not risking the union			2
' i 'm so proud and so positive about what 's happening in this country at the moment , and i just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this @entity19 - @entity44 condominium , ' he said			0
' so the answer would be , no i do n't think we are in any way imperiling the union			0
the people who would imperil the union , because that 's what their party is called , is the @entity44			0
' and i imagine their strategy - like the parable , or the fable , of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting ... [ he is cut off ] ' the @entity29 have made the prospect of a @entity19 administration that 's reliant on @entity44 votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight			0

he said : ‘ are you for keeping non-dom status ? you ’re defending those people who come here , they live here for 30 years , they are permanently here and they do n’t pay taxes here			0
’ mr @entity0 responded : ‘ hang on , is this the @entity1 who was in the @entity164 with @entity165 for about ten years ? are you the same creature ? i mean , is there some sort of doppelganger going on ? ’ the @entity19 leader hit back , saying : ‘ do n’t get rattled , come on now			1
@entity9 interjected to ask the @entity8 mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused mr @entity173 of being a back stabber			2
he said : ‘ you attacked @entity1 very forcibly today , @entity0 , for backstabbing			2
do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election ? before mr @entity0 could speak , mr @entity1 said : ‘ he does n’t believe it			1
come on , @entity0 , you are better than that			0
’ but the @entity8 mayor replied : ‘ i am not saying that your brother had to present himself at @entity61 with a dagger in his back			2
