by @entity1 reporter for most parents , having grandma take care of the children once in a while is a godsend			2
but it seems she may not be sharing the benefits – at least not if she does it too often			0
looking after the children for five days a week or more can make grandmas less mentally sharp , a study claimed yesterday			1
staying sharp : grandparents who look after their grandchildren once a week stay mentally alert for longer , research has found it found those who did so performed poorly in a test of working memory and mental processing speed			1
however , grannies who looked after the children just once a week showed improved mental agility			1
@entity26 of the @entity27 , which published the study in its journal , said : ‘ we know that older women who are socially engaged have better cognitive function and a lower risk of developing dementia later			0
but too much of a good thing just might be bad			0
’ the research , carried out by the women ’s healthy aging project , looked at 120 @entity40 grandmothers aged 57 to 68			0
each woman was given three tests of mental sharpness			1
@entity44 knows best : caring for children was found to have a particularly positive effect on grandmothers those who spent one day a week taking care of their grandchildren performed best in two of the tests			1
but those who lent a hand for five days or more fared significantly worse in the test that looked at working memory and mental processing speed			2
the researchers also found that the more time grandmothers spent taking care of the grandchildren , the more they felt their own children had been demanding of them			1
this suggests that mood may have affected the result			0
the investigators are already following up the project with more research			0
although other studies have examined the relationship between mental sharpness and being socially engaged , this is the first to look at how it affects grandmothers			1
after the menopause , women are at an increased risk of developing @entity79 ’s and other cognitive disorders			2
‘ because grandmothering is such an important and common social role for postmenopausal women , we need to know more about its effects on their future health , ’ said dr @entity26			0
‘ this study is a good start			0
