a memo sent to participants ahead of the event by the club 's community arm , seen by @entity43 , lays down the sky blue law			0
' please note ' it reads , ' only participants registered for our sessions will be allowed access to @entity10 ( no spectators ) , the surface is the same as the tennis centre and please do not wear any @entity4 kit as you wo n't be allowed in '			2
it is understood the message was meant to be lighthearted but the tone was lost in translation			0
however , the club have been moved to say sorry			0

@entity61 is committed to providing footballing opportunities for all regardless of which team they support			0
' the letter was addressed to the regular participants of the project and was related to the one - off event involving both current and past @entity0 players			2
it is not a policy for @entity61 , nor will it be repeated			0
' @entity87 banned all football shirts while the sprawling , state - of - the - art training complex was being built but denied it was a move made to stop @entity4 fans wearing their colours at the site			1
