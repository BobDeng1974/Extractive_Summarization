by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 would have had his bite ban shortened had he not concocted a ludicrous defence in which he claimed he ‘ fell ’ into his opponent			1
the disgraced @entity6 star had claimed in a letter to @entity8 that in no event did he bite or ‘ try to bite ’ @entity11 defender @entity10 during tuesday ’s @entity13 clash in @entity14			1
but members of the disciplinary committee were infuriated by @entity1 ’s pathetic mitigation and threw the book at him , banning him from all football for four months as well as nine international games			0
@entity1 submission to @entity8 said : ‘ in the run - up to the impact , my knees came together , i lost my balance and that destabilised my body and i fell into my opponent			1
in that moment , my face came into collision with the player , causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth , which caused the referee to stop play			0
that is what happened and in no event did i , as is written in the document , “ bite ” or “ try to bite ”			0
’ @entity1 ’s defence will be an embarrassment to @entity57 who are desperate to sell the striker despite knowing he can not command the £ 80million transfer figure talked about prior to the shocking incident			0
@entity6 went on to beat @entity11 1 - 0 and qualify for the last 16 and set up last night ’s clash with @entity63			2
@entity1 ’s claim of innocence was a huge misjudgment			0
the @entity67 noted he did not show ‘ any contrition or repentance of any type , nor did he admit any violation of @entity8 regulations ’			2
painful : @entity1 fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back @entity10 evidence : @entity10 looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder show of support : @entity6 's wags have given their backing to @entity1 following the striker 's ban message for his followers : @entity1 took to @entity91 to thank his fans for the messages of support they 'd sent thumbs up : @entity1 gestures to fans from the balcony of his home after returning to @entity6 rapturous reception : @entity1 was joined by his children as he greeted the army of fans who had gathered			1

@entity1 told @entity8 panel he did not deliberately bite @entity10
@entity6 *frontman* claimed he fell on top of @entity11 defender
he would have been banned for a shorter period of time had he not made such a ludicrous defence
@entity1 hit with a nine - game international ban and four - month *suspension* from all football
@entity8 have been formally informed of an appeal against the ban and @entity6 will have a further seven days to prepare *paperwork*
@entity8 *suggest* *punishment* was hefty because @entity1 did not ' show any kind of *remorse* or admit to any violation '
