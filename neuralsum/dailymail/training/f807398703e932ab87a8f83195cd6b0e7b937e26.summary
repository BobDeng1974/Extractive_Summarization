many celebrities , including @entity1 , have claimed to have a porn addiction but a clinical psychologist claims there is no evidence to suggest such an addiction exists from @entity1 to @entity8 , many celebrities have claimed to have a porn addiction			1
but new research has revealed there is no strong evidence that such an addiction actually exists			2
dr @entity14 , a clinical psychologist , and executive director of @entity18 solutions , a large behavioural health programme , has reviewed research into pornography addiction			1
he found only 37 per cent of research articles about excessive use of porn describe it as an addiction			1
he also discovered that just 27 per cent of articles on the subject contain actual data			1
as a result , he concluded that experiments carried out into the topic have been poorly designed and lacked the rigour to provide any proof			2
consequently , he concluded that very little , if any , actual evidence had been found to suggest the addiction exists			2
he noted that pornography addition was also not included in the latest version of the @entity39 because of a lack of scientific data			1
this manual is published by the @entity43 and is seen as the ' bible ' of mental health disorders			0
dr @entity14 also discovered there is no evidence to suggest there are negative side effects of excessive porn viewing			1
he said there was no sign that it was linked to erectile dysfunction or that it changes the brains of users			2
instead , dr @entity14 says it can actually improve attitudes towards sexuality , increase quality of life and increase pleasure in long - term relationships			1
he added that it provides a legal outlet for illegal sexual desires and that its use has been associated with a decrease in sexual offences , especially child molestation			0
the research also showed that people who claim to have a porn addiction are usually male , not heterosexual and have a high libido			2
they also often have religious values that conflict with their sexual desires			0
x-files star @entity8 has famously battled a porn addiction			0
but new research has found there is no evidence to suggest there are side effects of excessive porn viewing ‘ we need better methods to help people who struggle with the high frequency use of visual sexual stimuli , without pathologising them or their use thereof , ’ wrote dr @entity14			1
‘ rather than helping patients who may struggle to control viewing images of a sexual nature , the “ porn addiction ” concept instead seems to feed an industry with secondary gain from the acceptance of the idea			0
' while dr @entity14 is sceptical about the existence of porn addictions , many celebrities have claimed to have one			1
will @entity1 told @entity104 that he could n't stop himself looking at x-rated videos online			0
he told the magazine : ' it never moved into sex addiction			0
for me , it was love addiction and fantasy			0
i was probably addicted to porn			0
' in 2011 @entity113 also told @entity114 that she ' loves porn ' .			0

dr @entity14 says only 37 **%** of research articles about excessive porn use describe it as an addiction and just 27 **%** contain actual scientific data
he says experiments that have been carried out were poor quality
so , he says there ***'s*** no scientific evidence for the addition ***'s*** existence
added there is ' no evidence excessive porn use has negative side effects , such as erectile dysfunction , or that it changes the brain '
in fact , he says watching porn can improve someone ***'s*** quality of life
