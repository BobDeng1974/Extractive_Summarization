by @entity1 reporter published : 20:25 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 20:49 est , 2 july 2013 @entity2 is a train lover like no other			0
not only did she make a career out of building model train displays but her expansive estate is an homage to the locomotive			2
and over the weekend , @entity10 did something she does but once per year : she opened up her gardens to the public and something like 6,000 curious train lovers descended on her home			1
with10 acres of gardens , waterfalls , lakes , trestles , bridges , and replica towns and pastoral scenes , her @entity25 & @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , it ’s no wonder they call her the @entity30			1
elaborate : about 6,000 visitors got a chance to view @entity2 ' elaborate , train display - covered estate outside @entity35 saturday @entity10 began her new life as the @entity30 after her beloved late husband @entity37 ’s law career took off , leaving her in search of a hobby			1
that hobby became @entity42 , a company that designs and manufactures model railroads for home and garden displays			0
@entity47 & @entity48 ’s work has been seen in the @entity50 book , in the lobby of @entity35 ’s @entity52 , and in @entity54 window displays			0
serious business : @entity10 ( pictured ) turned a love of trains into a famous business that creates high - end train displays , one of which even appeared in @entity35 's @entity52 lobby expansive : the ten acre @entity25 & @entity26 features @entity64 gardens , waterways , topiaries , and seemingly endless displays , all with model trains chugging through year round intricate : miniature people even populate the model train worlds but @entity10 ’ biggest accomplishment is her own garden display			1
eleven model trains chug about the lavish gardens all - year round			1
the half - inch g - scale trains ply a @entity64 water garden with waterfalls , a pond garden , rose gardens , a @entity84 topiary built especially for @entity10 ’ grandsons , and other floral landscapes			1
also open to the day ’s visitors was the private train museum on @entity10 ’ @entity90 museum was built in honor of the @entity30 ’s husband , a famous attorney who once represented @entity93			2
the museum is a scaled down replica of @entity35 that has 16 trains of its own , a drive - in movie theatre , and other transit - related exhibits like elevated trains and subway trains			2
' i live in heaven ' : a train traverses a @entity64 waterscape in @entity10 ' expansive gardens that she calls heaven durable : there are many water features in @entity10 ' gardens			1
the trains that chug over and around them run all year round down to business : though @entity10 ( left ) has plenty of personal passion for her trains , they are also her business			1
@entity42 ( right ) creations have appeared in @entity35 's @entity121 , @entity54 's window displays , and on the @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity125 , the @entity129 , and @entity130 choo - choo : @entity10 preoccupation , before it was an occupation , began when her husband 's law career took off , leaving her with time on her hands for visitors , the once a year opportunity was well worth the $ 10 entrance fee			2
‘ it was fun , ’ young @entity142 told the @entity143 as he reluctantly stepped off a replica @entity145 train , inspired by the @entity148 film and book series visitors continually thanked @entity10 for inviting the public onto her estate			1
‘ i always feel like @entity153 for a day , ’ @entity2 said			0
she even offered tips on how to create one ’s own @entity155 & @entity26			0
in memoriam : @entity2 , known as the @entity30 , maintains her huge , locomotive gardens in part as a memorial to her late husband @entity37 , a lawyer who once defended @entity93 high flying : like the bustling metropolis of @entity35 , which is close by , @entity10 ' garden has elevated trains as well as purely terrestrial ones ‘ i tell everyone it ’s real easy , ’ she said			1
‘ all you need is to live here 40 - plus years , and buckets of money			0
’ ‘ i ’ve lived here 44 years now , ’ @entity2 clarified			0
‘ there was almost nothing here — the pond was here and a shabby , 1,000 - square - foot house			0
’ and no matter how much her home and gardens are appreciated by visitors , @entity10 seems to love it all the most			2
‘ i live in heaven , ' she said			0
is n’t it beautiful ? ' proceeds from saturday ’s event will go toward providing scholarships to promising artists who hope to attend the prestigious @entity189 in @entity190 , of which @entity10 is an alum , but who do n’t have the financial ability .			0
