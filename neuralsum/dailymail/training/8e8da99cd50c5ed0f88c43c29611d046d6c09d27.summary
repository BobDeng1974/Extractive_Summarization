a daredevil has smashed the world record for the longest distance walked on a highline - tiptoeing a massive 1,230 feet			1
the drawn - out line , which was anchored between two limestone boulders at 330 feet above the ground , beat the previous record by 230 feet			2
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , spent three days trying to cross the line - falling scores of times - while battling ferocious wind and rain			1
@entity27 and his co-workers from one inch dreams , a slacklining company , set up the line in @entity29 , @entity30 , where towering rocks covered in jungle foliage inspired the filmmakers of science - fiction epic @entity34			2
but the striking setting was an additional trial for the team , as much of the rock was too loose to attach the pulley systems and the face of the boulder was covered in shrubbery			1
for @entity27 , the difficulty began when he attempted to cross the line and it took him three days before he could complete it			2
focus : @entity27 said the most important thing was ' to get away from the fear of failure in order to be fully relaxed and able to react to the oscillation of the line after smaller mistakes ' trials : but the striking setting was an additional trial for the team , as much of the rock was too loose to attach the pulley systems and the face of the boulder was covered in shrubbery day by day : for @entity27 , the difficulty began when he attempted to cross the line and it took him three days before he could complete it take a break : by the end , he had smashed the world record for the longest distance walked on a highline - tiptoeing a massive 1,230 feet relaxed : @entity27 poses for a photograph with his co-workers from one inch dreams , a slacklining company , before the world record attempt he said : ' the most important thing was to get away from the fear of failure in order to be fully relaxed and able to react to the oscillation of the line after smaller mistakes			1
' the longer i was on the line , the harder it was to keep up the concentration			0
' at the last third , wind came up and started shaking the line			0
i had to force myself to keep on walking			0
thirty metres before the end the wind was gone , but the fear of falling came up like never before			0
' when i touched the rock at the end of the line , my first words were ' it 's surreal , i ca n't believe what just happened			0

@entity7 , 23 , from @entity8 , spent three days trying to cross line
he and team had set it up in @entity29 , @entity30 , where film @entity34 was set
but the constant showers made the rope heavy and soggy with water
and striking setting was a trial as rock too loose to attach pulley system
still he smashed world record for longest distance walked on a highline
he said : ' the most important thing was to get away from the fear of failure '
