the police raid on sir @entity3 ’s £ 3million home may have been illegal and could wreck any case against him , a senior lawyer warned yesterday			1
the row over the investigation deepened after the police were warned that any evidence they gathered against the 73 - year - old may be struck out if it ever came to court			2
last night sir @entity3 announced that he was pulling out of a concert at @entity14 next month as the star feared it would be ‘ overshadowed ’ by allegations that he molested a schoolboy at a @entity20 rally in 1985 , which he denies			1
he is sorry for any disappointment or inconvenience caused			0
’ the blow for fans comes as sir @entity3 is yet to confirm when he will fly home from his villa in @entity36 to face a police quiz			1
yesterday his close friend @entity24 said she was ‘ absolutely positive ’ of his innocence			0
the singer and former @entity25 presenter has been a close friend since they recorded a song together in 1969			0
‘ i , like everyone else , was shocked to hear of these allegations and i am absolutely positive that they are without foundation , ’ she said			0
human rights @entity50 @entity49 yesterday questioned the legality of the search warrant obtained at @entity53 ’ court by detectives before they raided sir @entity3 ’s @entity56 home almost a week ago			1
the 1984 @entity58 requires police to satisfy a magistrate not only that there are reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed , but there is material on the premises relevant to prove the alleged crime			0
a warrant should be issued only if it is ‘ not practicable to communicate ’ with the owner of the premises			0
@entity24 , pictured with sir @entity3 at @entity69 this year , has come out in defence of her friend , insisting she is ' absolutely positive ' he is innocent of claimed sexual abuse @entity3 has spoken out against the @entity73 , claiming they were alerted to the raid before he was but in this case sir @entity3 only learnt of the search as the @entity73 filmed live from a helicopter			1
‘ the police can not raid your home on a hunch , ’ said mr @entity49			2
‘ they must make a solemn application to a court , identifying the material they are looking for and swearing that it will be of “ substantial value ” – in this case to supporting a complaint about an assault 30 years ago			0
‘ they must explain why they were unable to contact @entity3 or his lawyers or agents			2
‘ most significantly they should have told the court about their deal with the @entity73 , because that was a significant matter that would disincline any magistrate from granting the search warrant			1
before they blasted @entity3 ’s reputation throughout the world , they should have given him the opportunity to refute the allegation			2
the importance of police following the rules is that if they do not , any evidence they obtain may be ruled inadmissible and their case would collapse			0
’ @entity115 has said it reluctantly agreed to work with the broadcaster after being approached by a reporter with information about its investigation			0
yesterday , sources confirmed that chief constable @entity121 will appear before mps after the @entity123 wrote to him and @entity73 director - general lord @entity124 warning them they may be called to give evidence			2
yesterday the @entity73 released a statement saying its reporting had been ‘ balanced and proportionate ’ and it had given ‘ due prominence ’ to sir @entity3 ’s denials			1
‘ it is worth noting that we made contact with sir @entity3 ’s agent as soon as the search had started but well before we broadcast the story , ’ it said			1
