by @entity0 a mysterious fire which destroyed @entity3 's greatest ancient civilization has led to fascinating discoveries about social tensions , violent tendencies and religious practices within the society			2
the city of @entity10 , whose secrets lie underneath where @entity13 , @entity14 now stands , was ruined by a huge blaze around the year 1170 ce. following the disaster , the @entity18 city changed dramatically - defense walls were built , buildings fortified and a sun symbol incorporated into designs			1
the significant changes have led to one nagging historical mystery - just how did the fire start ? the illustration is an aerial perspective of @entity10 circa ad 1150 - 1200 which was destroyed by a huge blaze secrets of the past : @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity33 is believed to have been built as a place of worship in ancient cultures an 1887 illustration of @entity34 blown a little out of proportion			1
however the ancient civilizations have long been of interest to history buffs @entity10 , pictured in this illustration , was originally a vast city encircled by 120 pyramids , stretches of farmland and wealthy communities			1
those who built the model city were known as the @entity52 because of the earthen structures similar to @entity54			1
the mounds appear to have had religious significance to the dwellers , with tombs below and places of worship on top			2
( only one remains today called @entity34 near @entity35 , @entity33			2
) like the @entity64 , the civilization was known to make human sacrifices , including dismembering and burying people alive			2
the city appeared in the year 600 around the same time as @entity69 culture was booming hundreds of miles to the south			1
@entity10 flourished over the next few hundred years , growing to a population of around 15,000 people - comparable to @entity73 or @entity74 at that time			1
what lies beneath : the secrets of the ancient city of @entity10 are buried below where @entity13 , @entity14 stands today a museum explains the practices of the ancient culture which reached its peak around @entity83 however at the height of the city 's boom , a huge fire tore through the center destroying many of the buildings which were wooden with thatched roofs			1
in 1250 , @entity10 had a population of 15,000 - similar to @entity73 or @entity74 at that time civilization was known to make human sacrifices - sometimes burying people alive according to a study , published this month in the @entity98 , strange new evidence is leading to exciting theories about the fire			1
at the new dig in east @entity13 , archaeologists found luxury items such as clay pots and animal bones used in ceremonies			1
the homes that were destroyed in the fire - around 100 in all - appeared to have been temporary structures			2
the scientists now believe that instead of the fire being an accident or being set by an enemy , it was in fact a mass sacrifice			0
the inhabitants left no written records beyond symbols on pottery , shell , copper , wood and stone			0
however one clue that led researchers to this theory is that evidence shows that the homes which were burned were not rebuilt			0
previous digs in @entity10 showed that if houses burnt down , then dwellers would rebuild on top however in this instance , the ashes were swept into piles and left untouched			1
another clue , is that home design changed dramatically in the wake of the fire			0
in the original city , the rich and powerful lived in large homes whereas following the blaze all the structures became more regulated and smaller			0
archaeologists believe that it is possible a group of rebels started the fire and took over the city			0
the use of the sun imagery may have been symbolic of a new religion or political leadership			0
the fire was a major event in the city 's existence and by 1400 , there was almost no one left			0
it lost power and never regained its reputation			0
@entity164 appears on a map of @entity33 in 1718 ( approximate modern state area highlighted ) from @entity167 by @entity168			0

@entity10 was built around @entity170 and stood on the site of @entity13 , @entity14
it was surrounded by 120 pyramids similar to @entity69 temples
with a population of 15,000 people , @entity10 was similiar in size to @entity74 or @entity73 at the time
