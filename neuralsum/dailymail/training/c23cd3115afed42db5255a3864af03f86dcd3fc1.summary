by @entity0 animal charities , including the @entity2 and @entity3 , have gone into ' partnership ' with @entity5 and animals are being sold in stores for an ' adoption fee ' rescue dogs and cats from some of @entity13 ’s biggest animal charities are being sold from the giant pet store chain @entity5			1
after years of campaigning for dogs and cats not to be sold in pet shops , charities such as the @entity2 and @entity3 & @entity18 have gone into ‘ partnership ’ with the @entity13 ’s biggest pet supermarket , and some animals – including cats – are on display in pens at stores , where they can be purchased for an ‘ adoption fee ’			1
the partnerships are a coup for @entity5 , which earned £ 600 million last year and was last week floated on the stock market for £ 1.23 billion			0
the company , which boasts that it raises tens of thousands of pounds in donations for animal charities every year , is planning an expansion programme in the @entity13 , aiming to operate more than 500 stores , 700 veterinary practices and 300 dog grooming outlets			2
but as @entity38 became the latest animal charity to announce a ‘ partnership ’ with @entity5 , the deals were slammed as ‘ irresponsible ’ and ‘ appalling			1
’ vet @entity41 , a past president of the @entity43 , said : ‘ selling animals from a pet store is an appalling idea			1
animal welfare organisations have fought for years to keep dogs and cats out of pet shops and you no longer see puppies and kittens in shop windows			1
‘ so this is a huge step backwards			0
i am also very concerned that shoppers will be encouraged to buy a pet on the spur of the moment			0
and i feel uncomfortable about cats being kept in pens in what will surely be stressful conditions			0
confined to a pen for too long , they can become depressed			0
’ @entity38 is to open its first rehoming centre at the supermarket ’s branch in @entity68 , @entity69 , next month			0
cats will be displayed in pens provided by the supermarket to the charity ’s specifications			0
shoppers will be able to choose a cat and , after paying an ‘ adoption fee ’ , return the next day to pick it up			1
@entity38 also hopes to sell its own branded merchandise in the store			0
if successful , the scheme could be rolled out to at least four other @entity5 stores			2
meanwhile , both the @entity2 and @entity3 & @entity18 have opened @entity5 rehoming centres over the past 18 months			1
but the move has come under criticism			0
vet @entity41 , a past president of the @entity43 , said : ' selling animals from a pet store is an appalling idea			1
animal welfare organisations have fought for years to keep dogs and cats out of pet shops and you no longer see puppies and kittens in shop windows			1
so this is a huge step backwards ' feelings are running high among @entity38 ’s 8,500 unpaid volunteers who have flooded the charity ’s private forums			2
one said : ‘ the thought of cats being screamed at by unruly kids with parents who will get them one to appease them , is frightening			0
it feels wrong and irresponsible			0
’ @entity38 said it hopes that the move will ‘ bring the message of responsible cat ownership to a wider audience ’ , adding : ‘ the cats will be safeguarded in the same way as the cats in our care , ensuring people can not buy on impulse			1
’ @entity5 said : ‘ we always put pets before profit and make no money from this partnership			2
we offer store space free of charge to certain charities to allow them to carry out their much - needed rehoming work			0
’ an @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ all animals rehomed via @entity5 are done so in accordance with the charity ’s strict adoption procedures			1
’ a @entity3 spokesman said : ‘ we are happy to work with this major retailer as it enables us to reach some of their customers who may not previously have considered rehoming an animal from a rescue centre			2

@entity5 has gone into partnership with charities including the @entity2 , @entity38 and @entity3 & cats
animals are on display in stores and sold for an ' adoption fee '
*top* vet *claims* the practise is ' an appalling idea '
he said animal welfare organisations campaigned to s*top* the selling of animals from stores , and this move is a ' step backward '
