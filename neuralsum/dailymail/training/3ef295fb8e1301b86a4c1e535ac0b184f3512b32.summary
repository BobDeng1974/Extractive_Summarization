by @entity0 flying robots that can ‘ think ’ for themselves are already being developed , which some people fear will be able to snoop on and attack people living below			1
and now a team of @entity8 scientists have managed to engineer the first ‘ flock ’ of drones that can fly as a coordinated group			1
the collection of 10 copters can fly in formation , follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input , to act a little like migratory birds			1
the collection of 10 copters can fly in formation , follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input they are the first ‘ flock ’ of drones that can fly autonomously as a coordinated group			1
the collection of 10 copters can fly in formation , follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input			1
they can be instructed to form a circle and they each find a position along it and rotate slowly in the same direction			0
their autonomous decisions avoid collisions in the air			0
the drones are commercially available quadcopters – with four rotor blades – but have specially designed hardware on board that allow them to act as a swarm			0
created by scientists at @entity55 in @entity56 , the drones navigate using signals from gps receivers and let each other know their positions via radio , @entity52 reported			1
the researchers ' breakthrough could mean that flocks of autonomous flying robots could take to the skies sooner than previously thought			1
experts created their own computer simulation after fitting tiny gps trackers to pigeons ( stock image pictured ) to see how the birds fly as a flock and used the knowledge to inform the behaviour of their drones @entity77 , a physics professor at the university , explained that the group of 10 drones can coordinate their movements to form circles or lines , which could be useful if one day the technology is used to create swarms of surveillance drones			1
he and his team was inspired to create the robots after seeing a 1986 computer game called @entity90 that simulated flying objects according to three rules – alignment , attraction and repulsion - so that robots could fly in formation without crashing into each other			2

while some people might fear that swarms of thinking drones could prove a surveillance menace , the scientists said they could be used for many peaceful applications , such as delivering food they created their own computer simulation using the same ideas after fitting tiny gps trackers to pigeons to see how they fly as a flock and used the knowledge to inform the behaviour of their drones			1
‘ we fed flocking algorithms to them so the copters can fly autonomously – totally eliminating the need for manual control , ’ professor @entity77 said			2
‘ each has a little brain in the form of an on - board computer and is completely autonomous			0
all decisions , directions , flight positions are decided by them , ’ he explained			0
the drones can be instructed to form a circle and they each find a position along it and rotate slowly in the same direction			0
their autonomous decisions avoid collisions in the air			0
the group of 10 drones can coordinate their movements to form circles ( pictured ) or lines , which could be useful if one day the technology is used to create swarms of surveillance drones the researchers had to overcome the challenges of noise and delay , which it hard for copters to ‘ see ’ each other ’s positions and sped up their reaction times			1
they plan on replacing radio signals with cameras to help the drones ‘ see ’ one another more easily in the future			2
they will present their research at the @entity160 , to be held in @entity161 , @entity162 in september			0
while some people might fear that swarms of thinking drones could prove a surveillance menace , the scientists said they could be used for many peaceful applications , such as delivering food and parcels			2
commenting on the study , @entity171 , an expert on collective animal behaviour at @entity173 in @entity174 , told nature : ‘ this is remarkable work			0
it is the first outdoor demonstration of how biologically inspired rules can be used to create resilient yet dynamic flocks			0
’ the research suggests that ‘ we will be able to achieve large , coordinated robot flocks much sooner than many would have anticipated , ’ he added .			0

scientists in @entity56 created the first ' flock ' of flying robots
the collection of 10 copters can fly in formation , follow a leader and change flight patterns without human input
they navigate using signals from gps receivers and let each other know their positions via radio
experts predict that swarms of surveillance drones could be used soon
