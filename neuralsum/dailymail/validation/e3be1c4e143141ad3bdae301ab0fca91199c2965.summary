next time someone asks you how wide the @entity2 is , you might want to rethink your answer of ' 100,000 light - years '			1
astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy , making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light - years wide			1
this is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy , which the astronomers think is now actually part of the @entity2			1
astronomers in @entity16 have revised the size estimate for our galaxy ( shown )			1
they now say it is 50 per cent bigger in size at 150,000 light - years wide , not 100,000 light - years			1
this is based on re-examining a ring of stars in the so - called @entity24 the team of scientists from @entity27 in @entity16 studied the @entity24 , which is a long ring - like filament of stars that ‘ wraps ’ around our galaxy three times			1
it is located 65,000 light - years from our galaxy ’s centre , and in total is 200,000 light - years in length			1
previously it was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby @entity39 due to interactions with the @entity2			1
the @entity2 is thought contain more than 200 billion stars			2
this makes it a ‘ middleweight ’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known , @entity46 , containing more than 100 trillion stars			0
on a clear night , when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the @entity52 is about 2,500 stars			0
like more than two - thirds of the known galaxies , the @entity2 has a spiral shape			0
at the centre of the spiral , a lot of energy and , occasionally , vivid flares are created			0
astronomers believe the @entity2 was n’t always a stunning barred spiral			0
it formed into its current size by ‘ eating ’ other galaxies			0
now , however , it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy , and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies			2
‘ it looks to me like maybe these patterns are following the spiral structure of the @entity2 , so they may be related , ’ dr @entity73 , from the @entity27 in @entity16 , told @entity74			2
‘ it now looks to me like it ’s part of the disk , ’ she added			0
the latest discovery was made using the @entity82 , a projecting to map parts of the universe in three dimensions			0
the results will be published in the @entity87			0
another ring , known as the @entity89 , may also be part of the @entity2 , further increasing its size			2
to verify their theory , astronomers will use data from @entity97 ’s @entity96 telescope , which is also mapping stars in the @entity2			2
previously the @entity24 was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby @entity39 due to interactions with the @entity2 ( illustration shown )			1
now , however , it seems that the ring may actually be part of our own galaxy , and could have been disturbed by other dwarf galaxies			0

astronomers in @entity16 have revised the size estimate for our galaxy
they now say it is 150,000 light - years wide , not 100,000 light - years
this is based on re-examining a ring of stars called the @entity24
previously this was thought to belong to a nearby dwarf galaxy
now astronomers are *fairly* certain it is part of the @entity2
