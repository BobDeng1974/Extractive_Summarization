they were once sprawling palace compounds that were used to intimidate and strike fear into the hearts of @entity4			1
now the homes and residences of colonel @entity7 have been reduced to rubble - and even used as pet markets to sell birds and dogs			2
four years after the 2011 revolution that saw @entity7 's hold on @entity4 crumbled , the once feared @entity14 , situated in the capital city of @entity16 , resembles a wasteland			1
the dictator ruled for almost 42 years , after he took control in a coup d'etat in 1969			0
following an uprising as part of the @entity42 in 2011 and ensuing civil war , he was hounded out of @entity16 and killed by members of the @entity46			1
speaking about life before the uprising , @entity16 taxi driver @entity47 said people feared to go near the @entity51 in @entity16			0
' people were afraid even to look at the walls , for fear of being arrested , ' he said			1
all that remains of the palace , which had been hit in a 1986 @entity58 air strike before being pounded by @entity59 four years ago , are a few ruined buildings , the green flooring of @entity7 's home and a dug - up network of underground tunnels			1
then : a mural of a smiling @entity7 was painted on the side of the @entity14 palace , but was a symbol of fear and terror to @entity4 growing up @entity7 's children enjoyed their own fairground within the palace in @entity16 - yet millions of @entity4 people suffered under his reign now : the palace has lain in ruin for almost four years , after it was hastily bulldozed by rebels once they took control of it in 2011 nowadays , only shabby outbuildings are left on the palace grounds , covered in graffiti and revolutionary slogans , while holes leading to a network of underground tunnels that once ran under the stronghold can still be accessed the monument of a gold - coloured fist clenching a @entity58 fighter plane was vandalised and sent off to @entity92 , a rebel bastion during the revolt which ousted and killed @entity7			1
at a safe distance from his people , @entity7 lived behind fortified walls with his wife , their children , close advisers and guards			2
apart from the bedouin tents on which @entity7 prided himself and which accommodated him on travels abroad , the compound once showcased a zoo , an indoor pool , countless murals and a fairground in its gardens			1
rebels posted for photos in a foreign dignitaries reception room at @entity14 when they stormed the building in 2011 the rebels later bulldozed the palace - but the green flooring from @entity7 's home is still visible in parts of the derelict site @entity7 had expanded the grounds by knocking down adjacent neighbourhoods			1
@entity14 ' was a symbol of the @entity7 era			0
today , we have destroyed this symbol , we have demolished and razed it to the ground , ' said @entity130 , tourism ministry spokesman of a @entity16 - based government			1
' he ( @entity7 ) will be mentioned briefly in history books and documentaries but nothing of his will remain as it is , ' said @entity130			0
rebels hastily bulldozed much of the compound when they captured it in august 2011			0
a @entity4 army soldier patrols the heavily - fortified compound in march 2011 , before the beginning of the civil war and fighters took it over having taking control of the palace in late 2011 , rebels used a crane to remove the statue of the @entity58 plane clutched by a fist outside the building rubbish now piles up at the site of the former @entity16 palace			1
plans to turn the site into a national park have never materialised homeless families moved into the few buildings left standing , and initial plans to turn @entity14 into a national park have not materialised			0
the walls are splattered with graffiti and revolutionary slogans - some with the names of fighters killed in the battle for the compound			2
another of @entity7 's homes in @entity172 in the south of the country has suffered the same fate			2
in the eastern city of @entity178 , birthplace of the revolution and which has since become an @entity182 stronghold , traders have converted his more than 10 - hectare palace grounds and barracks into a marketplace to sell birds , dogs and other pets			2
' we dreamt of a better life after the fall of @entity7 , but here we are in his ruins , ' said @entity193 , 43 , surrounded by children			0
the site of @entity7 's palace in the @entity4 city of @entity178 is now a market place , packed with traders selling bric and back , clothes and pets a @entity4 man holds high a bird , available to buy from the market			1
four years on , the landscape has completed changes for @entity4 people the old palace site was out of bounds for many but is now a thriving market			2
' it is is a powerful message to the new rulers ' says one @entity4 ' this is a powerful message to the new rulers of @entity4			0
if @entity7 had given us freedom and treated us with dignity , with a decent standard of living , he would still have been here			0
' in 2012 , the @entity182 group @entity224 which the @entity58 has branded a terrorist organisation occupied @entity7 's @entity178 home and turned it into their headquarters			0
it was pulverised in air strikes launched last october by @entity231 forces loyal to the internationally recognised @entity4 government based in the country 's far east			2
now , the area is used as a dumping ground where the city 's municipality burns household rubbish			0
' this place is not worthy of being anything but a dump			0
it reminds us of a black chapter in our history and many painful memories , ' said @entity248 , a passer - by			0
the former palace in @entity178 is now a dumping ground for people 's rubbish , having once symbolised @entity7 's grip on @entity4			1

opulent palace in @entity16 - which once had a zoo , fairground and pool - was razed to the ground during revolution
@entity4 were ' even afraid to look at walls of palace ' , for fear of being arrested while @entity7 was in power
now his former strongholds lie in ruin , after civil war which devastated country and saw @entity7 killed by rebels
