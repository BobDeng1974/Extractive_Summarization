by @entity0 published : 09:25 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 6 may 2013 victim : @entity2 said his teaching career is ruined after online harassment from an ex a @entity7 teacher has claimed that his career has been ruined because his ex-girlfriend refuses to stop posting naked pictures of him online and calling him a pedophile			1
@entity2 , 35 , from @entity12 , has been relentlessly cyber-stalked and harassed by @entity13 , whom he dated for several months while working as a teacher in @entity15 in 2010 , he said			1
he claims that after ending the relationship with @entity13 , she broke into his apartment , stole his laptop and uploaded naked pictures of him - which she had previously taken - to ' cheater ' websites			1
he has been applying for jobs since january and has received no positive responses - and he is certain it is because of the online posts and pictures			2
despite winning a defamation case against @entity13 , many of the sites are still active			1
they show pictures of a nude @entity2 beneath headings including ' child lover ' and ' pedophile '			1
' would you want this man to teach your children ? ' another reads			0
@entity13 also allegedly hacked into his email account and , posing as @entity2 , sent messages to his contacts ' revealing ' how he had sex with underage students , @entity37 reported			1
the harassment has been relentless - with her posting hundreds of comments on social networks such as @entity48 , accusing him of vile , criminal acts , and claiming that he cheated on her			0
' i did a @entity55 search of my name and i saw profiles listed saying i am a psychopath , i am a child molester , a pedophile , i am involved with my students and so on , ' he told @entity37			0
@entity61 : he successfully sued his ex-girlfriend , @entity13 , for defamation but the posts remain online @entity2 , who returned to @entity12 in january after his contract with the @entity15 school ended , said the treatment - and his struggle to remove posts from the web - has left him unable to get a job			1
' i feel not only shut out of my own profession - but any job i apply for , ' he said			0
' it 's a very , very dark place to be ... and i am powerless			0
' he believed there was some hope when a judge in @entity15 found @entity13 guilty of defamation and ordered her pay him the equivalent of $ 66,000 in damages in 2011			1
yet even this did not stop her , @entity2 said , as she left court and immediately began posting more pictures and comments			2
the judge then ordered her to be jailed for contempt of court but she fled the country			0
relentless : @entity2 's name and picture appears on numerous websites such as ' liarscheatersrus.com ' no giving up : even when a court found her guilty of defamation , @entity13 continued to post messages in an unprecedented move , the court also told search engine providers @entity55 , @entity102 and @entity103 to block @entity2 's name from search engines , but the companies have said this is impossible			1
' even if we did remove the name it would not make the content disappear from other places on the web , since @entity55 â€™s search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the web , ' @entity55 spokesperson @entity107 said			0
' users who want content removed from the internet should contact the webmaster of the page directly			0
' @entity2 said he has also gone done this avenue - getting mixed responses from webmasters - but even when the posts are taken down , @entity13 will just put them back up again			2
he has even gone to @entity12 police , in the hope of getting an international arrest warrant for @entity13			1
cruel : she uploaded naked photos of @entity2 and emailed his friends to say he 'd had sex with students but authorities said they are only able to get a @entity7 - wife warrant for the arrest - which is useless as @entity2 believes she is in @entity139			1
@entity141 said he understood @entity2 's frustrations			0
' the internet and society has moved at such a fast pace , that government and law enforcement are unable to keep pace , ' said @entity141			0
' this is a huge mess ... and it feels awful			0
' for now @entity2 said he can merely continue to contact websites , search for jobs with good references from previous posts - and warn students against the memory of the internet			2
' everything that was digital and saved in my life - whether it was in the hard drive or laptop - is just at the disposal of this woman , ' said @entity2			2
' it will never stop ... it will go on and on			0

@entity2 dated @entity13 for several months in @entity15
she ' broke into his home , stole his laptop , *shared* nude pictures of him online and emailed his friends to say he 'd slept with underage students '
he won defamation case against @entity13 but she has not stopped
@entity2 , who lives in @entity7 , can not get an arrest warrant for her as the case was won in @entity15 and she is now in @entity139
