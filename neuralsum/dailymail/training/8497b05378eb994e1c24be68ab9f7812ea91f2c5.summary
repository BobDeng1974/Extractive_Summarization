putting the kitchen knives away and out of reach of our 11 - year - old son for fear he would deliberately hurt himself has been , without doubt , our lowest point as parents			2
but we had no choice			2
two months after starting ‘ big school ’ last year our lovely boy , @entity9 , our previously care - free fourth child , had made an attempt to cut his arm with a large chopping knife			1
@entity9 had skipped off to secondary school full of excitement			1
when your child breaks a leg it ’s a blue light into @entity20			2
but when you arrive at a @entity24 surgery to seek help on mental problems , the first response was to tell our child to pull himself together ( file picture ) but within weeks he had descended into a mental health freefall — consumed with worry about being late to school and struggling with his homework , he became severely withdrawn and paranoid			1
he was n’t sleeping , and his anxiety was making him physically unwell			2
my husband and i were not remotely prepared for it			2
three months after he tried to cut himself — and by now nearly halfway through his school year — @entity9 was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder ( @entity42 ) , which means you feel anxious about almost everything			1
sufferers also start catastrophising , imagining the worst possible outcome for everything that is bothering them			0
indeed for @entity9 , every problem would morph into something far bigger			1
our son is now well on his way to a complete recovery , thanks to cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity57 )			0
but accessing the specialist help he needed was unbelievably difficult , and if i had n’t kept battling his corner , there is no doubt in my mind that by now he would be in hospital			0
when your child breaks a leg it ’s a blue light into @entity20			2
when their asthma gets worse , the doctor will write you a new inhaler prescription			0
but when you arrive at a @entity24 surgery to seek help on mental problems , the first response — at least in our case — was to tell our child to pull himself together			2
so a crushing report published last month by the @entity83 made painfully familiar reading			2
it is estimated that one in ten children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder — including @entity42 — which equates to three children per class			1
that ’s 290,000 children in @entity93			1
the report concluded there were ‘ serious and deeply ingrained problems ’ with mental health services for these young people			1
at first , i approached the school , two weeks into @entity9 ’s first term			1
doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis , according to the report from the @entity83 i explained he seemed disproportionately stressed			1
but responses from staff were feeble : ‘ do n’t worry , it ’s @entity111 , they all feel a bit like this ’ and ‘ we have children here with real problems , just give him time , he ’ll settle ’			1
although @entity9 was able to keep it together at school , every day he would come home crying and all the problems would tumble out			1
‘ i do n’t like that school , i do n’t like my tutor , i ’ve no one to sit with at break , ’ the list was endless			2
as the weeks went by , he started having trouble sleeping			0
he would regularly still be awake into the early hours , crying and screaming that he hated life			0
he began to sleepwalk and lost weight			0
it was a frightening time for all of us			0
every waking minute of every day my thoughts were centred on @entity9			1
after two months , i took him to see the gp			0
i could n’t get an appointment with my usual doctor , so we saw another @entity24 in the practice			0
she did n’t know our family at all , and had no way of gauging if this behaviour was usual for us			0
indeed , doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis , according to the new report			1
in a poignant comment , gp @entity147 , who is the @entity148 ’ clinical champion for youth mental health issues , told the @entity83 : ‘ in a ten - minute consultation it can feel overwhelming to open a @entity152 and begin to look at what is troubling a young person			1
especially if the options for referral are limited and difficult to access			0
’ the report ’s authors want @entity159 to receive better training in young people ’s mental health , saying everyone has a right to see a professional with sufficient knowledge			1
@entity167 , chairman of the @entity148 , says it has been campaigning to include mandatory placements in mental health care in gp training			1
the gp we saw initially advised us to give @entity9 a few more weeks to see if school became more familiar			1
but a week later @entity9 came home with his older brother , who announced he could n’t cope any more with his sibling ’s increasingly erratic behaviour to and from school			1
he said @entity9 was constantly checking his bag , checking the time and , on occasions , would try to go back to school at the end of the day to check his homework with the teachers			1
it 's estimated 290,000 children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder it was as he was telling me this that @entity9 took a large kitchen knife to his arm			1
it was a half - hearted attempt and thankfully he did n’t actually pierce the skin			0
my ‘ lioness protecting her cubs ’ instinct kicked in			0
through his tears — and mine — i calmly told him to put down the knife and hugged him , saying whatever i could think of to comfort him			0
you will do anything to protect your child , but i knew i was woefully out of my depth			0
as much as i was saying we would help him , i knew ‘ the system ’ was failing us			0
that same day , i went to the gp surgery and asked for an appointment then and there			0
but it was the end of surgery hours and it was only when i quietly refused to leave they agreed to see us			0
we saw yet another @entity24 , who leaned forward and told @entity9 all about the patients she had seen that day , who were perhaps more in need of help than him			1
i told her calmly that our son had dallied with knives and told his brother he wanted to die			0
the gp — barely out of med - school — stayed completely expressionless , not so much as a raised eyebrow			2
i asked for a referral to child and adolescent mental health services and at first she suggested we wait and see and come back in the @entity231 — some four weeks later — if need be			1
with tears of frustration now rolling down my cheeks , i again indicated my willingness to camp in the surgery until the referral letter was written			0
she begrudgingly agreed , though our son still was n’t seen — even as an emergency referral — until january			0
the psychiatrist we saw was sympathetic but made a shocking suggestion			0
if we could afford it we should pay privately for @entity57 — @entity9 could wait to get it on the @entity245 , but that could take as long as three months			1
she could see he needed help urgently , but said there was nothing she could do			0
@entity252 , policy manager at the charity @entity253 , is not surprised by our story			0
he says last year 77 per cent of clinical commissioning groups , ( the bodies responsible in @entity257 for commissioning , planning , agreeing and monitoring health services ) had their budgets cut or frozen for such services			2
in emergency cases , children can end up in police cells as there are no @entity245 beds available			2
we have private medical insurance			0
but still it was a battle — at every stage i had to keep chasing , and it was n’t until march we had our first appointment with the psychologist who would finally help our son			0
@entity9 found it hard — @entity57 works on changing your thought processes , which is not easy — but he is now well on the road to recovery			2
he found it difficult returning to school this september but his psychologist helped him with strategies so he could cope			2
we ’ve been warned by @entity9 ’s therapist that he may always be someone who does n’t react well to big change			1
but how wrong it is that the help he badly needed was not there for him			0
please , health provider decision makers , wake up and make child and adolescent mental health issues a bigger priority			1
just last week it was revealed seven mental health patients have killed themselves since 2012 while waiting for a bed on a specialist ward			1
what more will it take before mental healthcare is taken seriously ? it has to be , for all our sakes — but most of all for those young people who need it			1
