by @entity1 reporter homeowners living in the world 's tallest residential skyscraper are having to climb up more than 1,300ft of steps - the equivalent of walking one - third of the way up @entity9 - after all the lifts broke down			1
@entity10 in @entity11 , which stands at 1,355ft tall with 97 above - ground residential floors , has been named the tallest residential building in the world @entity15			1
but residents living in the luxurious tower block - many of whom are @entity16 - have been told they have ' no choice ' but to walk up to their flats , some on the 97th floor , after all eight lifts in the building broke down last week			1
tall order : residents of @entity11 's @entity28 , the tallest building pictured with a domed roof , have been told they will have to use the stairs to reach their flats after all eight lifts in the building broke down the building , which has six levels in the basement and 101 above ground level , opened in september last year , with two - bed flats on the rental market for £ 140 - a - day and penthouse flats selling for more than £ 2million			1
it is 339ft taller than the @entity40 , although still dwarfed by the world 's tallest building , the 2,722ft tall @entity43 in @entity11 which is not classed as a residential building			2
princess @entity10 boasts 763 luxury apartments as well as eight giant stores and overlooks the @entity48 , the manmade ' palm island ' where @entity49 and @entity50 are said to have bought luxury pads			0
but after a persistent water leak , the owners of @entity53 have shut down all of its eight lifts - forcing residents to walk the equivalent of one - third of the way up @entity61 's highest mountain - which stands at 4,408ft tall			1

rooms with a view : all eight lifts in the @entity10 , pictured centre with the domed roof , broke down after a hose pipe leak on the 96th floor flat owners have today been told that a solitary ' service elevator ' is available for ' limited ' trips to the 50th floor - but anyone living above that level will still have to walk the rest of the way			1
bosses at the skyscraper - owned by @entity85 estates - say the flooding was caused by water from the ' fire protection system ' and that a ' faulty fire hose ' was to blame			2
water from the hose got into the residents ' lift shafts , flooding them and causing them to be shut down			0
one resident , who lives on the 78th floor , said : ' i came home after a hard day of work and was told i 'd have to walk to my apartment on the 78th floor			2
' i truly could n't believe it - there was no way i was walking all that distance so i just booked myself into a hotel			0
' the 47 - year - old , who left the @entity16 two years ago to take a job in @entity11 , added : ' they need to get this fixed pronto - i ca n't afford a hotel every night			0
' quite a climb : the startling view from the 85th floor of the @entity10 in @entity114 gives an idea the stair climb faced by residents after the building 's lifts broke down an email sent by the skyscrapers owners ' association , called @entity123 , said : ' the serious leak occurred from a fire hose reel located on the 96th floor and although there are strong indications as to the cause of the leak , all associated contractors , insurance loss adjusters and building design consultants are completing their investigations and reports into the incident at this time			1
' once we have received the conclusions we will advise all residents of the findings forthwith			0
' we ask that all residents continue to be vigilant with taps / hand sprays in their apartments , as we all know that the implications to the building systems can be quite severe in the event of water leaks			0
' in the meantime , parts from @entity150 in @entity151 are being flown in before repairs can be made			2
a spokesman for @entity150 said : ' we have had engineers on site 24 - hours a day since the water leak occurred			0
