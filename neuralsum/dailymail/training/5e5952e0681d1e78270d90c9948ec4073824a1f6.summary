by @entity0 last updated at 2:38 am on 15th november 2011 @entity2 ’s life changed last year , on november 9 , when he turned on his car radio			1
‘ a specialist was on talking about aneurysms , ’ recalls the 73 - year - old grandfather			1
‘ i ’d never heard of them before but he described them as a swelling in an artery that can cause fatal blood loss			2
lucky to be alive : @entity2 had a dangerously large aneurysm ‘ i was n’t listening too intently at first			1
but then he said men aged 65 and over could be at risk — and that you would n’t know you had one as there were no symptoms '			1
the presenter gave out a contact number for the local @entity23 aneurysm screening programme			1
@entity2 scribbled it on the back of his hand at the next set of traffic lights and called later that day			0
the retired @entity23 administrator , from @entity30 , @entity31 , was booked to have an ultrasound scan in hospital the following monday			0
‘ i just lay down on a couch and lifted my shirt , and they rubbed some jelly on my tummy			0
it only took about 15 minutes in all and they gave me the results immediately , ’ says @entity2			0
he was told he had a large aortic aneurysm			1
that meant a section of his aorta — the largest artery in the body , which carries blood from the heart down to the bowel , liver , kidneys and legs — was weak and bulging , and could rupture at any time			2
aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body , but the aorta is most prone to the problem			2
@entity2 had been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm ( @entity62 ) — @entity64 ’s fourth biggest killer in men over 65 , after cancer , heart attacks and stroke			1
killer : it is estimated that 6,000 people die from aneurysms every year an estimated 6,000 people — mostly men — die from them every year			1
frighteningly , the condition often has no symptoms			0
‘ there ’s usually no warning , ’ says @entity77 , consultant vascular surgeon at the @entity78 , and director of the @entity23 screening programme			2
‘ generally speaking , you do n’t know you ’ve got one until it bursts			0
most people die from a loss of blood			1
you can be perfectly well one day and dead the next '			0
an abdominal aortic aneurysm may develop when the aorta wall loses its elasticity , he adds			1
‘ the aorta wall can stretch with age			0
that means the aorta can develop a bulge — an aneurysm			2
it usually takes a few years for the aneurysm to grow , but once the bulge is more than 5.5cm wide there ’s a significant risk of it bursting '			1
although some aneurysms will never swell to that red alert of 5.5cm , about 50 per cent of people with the condition will eventually need treatment			1
@entity2 ’s aneurysm was 6.5cm when he went in for his scan			1
four weeks later , surgeons at @entity112 , in @entity110 , carried out the life - saving operation			2
the swollen section of his aorta was cut open and replaced with a synthetic tube			0
tissue from the artery was then wrapped round the new tube and stitched into place			0
‘ i had to take it extremely carefully at first after the operation , ’ says @entity2			0
‘ but in a few months , i was completely back to normal '			0
not all aneurysm operations involve major surgery such as @entity2 ’s			1
sometimes the condition can be treated with keyhole surgery to insert a stent — a man - made narrow tube — inside the aneurysm itself , which reduces pressure on the artery			1
high cholesterol , smoking and being overweight can all contribute to developing an aneurysm , as they all encourage fatty deposits in arteries			2
these deposits cause inflammation , which makes artery walls lose their elasticity and bulge as a result			0
the @entity23 is running a screening programme to cut deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms			1
already available in 40 per cent of @entity149 , it started to roll out to the rest of the country last month			0
all men in screening areas will receive a letter inviting them for a scan when they turn 65			1
@entity156 also has a programme			0
@entity158 and @entity159 plan to start theirs from 2012			0
‘ many of the men we see will have nothing to worry about , ’ says @entity77			2
‘ but we ’ve found 130 men with a large aneurysm in the first two years of the programme			1
‘ any of those could have burst and killed them '			0
@entity2 is well aware this could have been his fate : ‘ if i had n’t been listening to the radio that day last november , there ’s a real chance i might not have been here today			2
i really do feel incredibly lucky ' .			0

an estimated 6,000 people - mostly men - die from aneurysms every year
