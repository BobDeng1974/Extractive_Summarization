by @entity0 published : 11:46 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 11:55 est , 6 august 2013 mother - of - four @entity2 competing in and winning her first ever bodybuilding competition a female barrister has been dubbed ' the strong arm of the law ' after winning a national bodybuilding competition			1
mother - of - four @entity2 , from @entity9 , south @entity10 , spends her days in a wig and gown but at night changes into a sparkly bikini and has just won her first competition after less than a year of training			1
mrs @entity2 says she is showing what can be achieved while juggling a demanding job and a growing family			1
she said : ' it was the first bodybuilding contest i have ever taken part in so it was a huge personal achievement for me			0
' i 'm still a practising barrister and i 'm a busy mum of four , so that adds to the sense of victory			0
' i 'm flying the flag for the working mums and showing what we can achieve			2
' the hard work she puts in at the gym has clearly paid off as she has just scooped the top prize at the @entity34			0
despite only starting to train properly in october last year she came first in the over forties women 's class at the @entity38 section of the event			1
and although it might not be the most normal of hobbies mrs @entity2 's four children @entity42 , 20 , @entity44 , 18 , @entity45 , nine , and @entity46 , five , are all extremely proud of her achievement			1
mrs @entity2 was called to the bar in 1998 and is a member of @entity50 in @entity9 but despite her professional success says she has always been ' interested ' in fitness			2
by day she is a successful family law barrister specialising in child law , adoption and child abduction cases			0
but far from being a problem in her busy schedule she says her intense workouts have actually helped keep her sane			1
she added : ' i have always been interested in fitness , it 's not an off the cuff thing			0
' but i have only been seriously training since about october last year			1
lady of the law : @entity2 scooped the top prize after training for less than a year ' i set myself the challenge and decided to enter the championships			1
' if you have a busy lifestyle , it gives you that challenge and a personal sense of achievement			0
' it has kept me sane mentally and physically to deal with all the other elements of my busy life			0
' but her relaxed attitude belies the strict regimen she follows as she admits she has to be extremely careful about what she eats			0
juggling : @entity2 finds , despite the challenge , her intense workouts actually help her to balance the pressures of being a top lawyer and a mother she added : ' the important thing in this is the diet - it has to be very strict			1
it 's chicken , fish , cottage cheese and all the healthy options			0
' for her , she explains it is important to be feminine as well as strong and so follows a natural workout routine to avoid the pitfalls of the stereotypical female bodybuilders			0
her average workout regime is resistance weight training with some low intensity cardio work to burn fat			2
a spokesman for @entity50 chambers said : ' we joke that @entity2 is the strong arm of the law - but we are very proud of all her achievements			2

@entity2 , 45 , only began training in october last year
she says intense workouts have helped her cope with the pressures of being a working mother
