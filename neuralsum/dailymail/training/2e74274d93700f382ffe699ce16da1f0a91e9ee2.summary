the @entity1 phenomenon has reached fever pitch with many travellers opting out of staying in conventional hotels			1
but the reality of staying in someone 's home - or indeed sharing your own home with relative strangers - can be whirlwind of social expectations and potential for awkwardness			1
which is why long - standing etiquette experts , @entity16 's , have formulated a guide to navigating the minefield of modern manners , whether you 're hosting or staying in someone else 's home			1
airbnb guests are advised to be punctual , remove muddy shoes and avoid prying into their hosts ' affairs sixty - eight per cent of the @entity29 public think that social etiquette is on the decline according to research by @entity1 , as part of their collaboration with @entity16 's			1
the guide hopes to rectify this by combining guidance rooted in centuries of @entity29 etiquette , such as rules on punctuality and how to make the perfect introduction , with advice on modern predicaments like smartphones and social media at the dinner table			1
guests are advised to be punctual , remove muddy shoes before entering their accommodation , and avoid poking their noses where they 're not wanted			1
lingering baths and making a mess of the bathroom are frowned upon , as is smoking real - or e-cigarettes in no - smoking zones , and the excessive use of mobile phones			2
' giving , and enjoying , hospitality is an occasion on which everyone should be on their best behaviour , and it is imperative that both hosts and guests put their gadgets away , look up and focus on the other people in the room , ' it states			2
' talking while glancing at a screen looks adolescent and ill - mannered			2
' social skills experst , @entity16 's , have formulated a guide to hosting or staying in someone else 's home 1			1

open the door with a smile @entity1 's research revealed that playing with a mobile phone was the most sociably unacceptable thing to do in someone else ' home - according to 65 per cent of those asked			1
getting drunk and announcing special dietary requirements at the last minute were also looked down upon			0
meanwhile , hosts are expected to create a welcoming environment			0
rooms should contain freshly made - up beds , guest towels , storage space and some welcoming touches , for example a vase of flowers , some bedside reading or guest soap			0
' it is deeply discouraging for guests to find themselves accommodated in , for example , a children 's bedroom , forced to squeeze into a small divan , negotiate their way past piles of cuddly toys and gaze up at mobiles and luminous stars , ' the guide says			1
stocked up loo roll and plenty of clean towels are advised if hosts want to stay in favour with their guests and do n't forget to offer guests a hot drink			0
not being offered a cup of tea was found to be ' shocking ' by @entity1 's research team			1
when it comes to pets and children , while you might adore yours , others might find a yapping dog or yelling toddler a trifle irritating at 5am			0
' look carefully at the behaviour of your children and dogs and try objectively to understand the effect they have on other people			0
then do your utmost to ensure that any negative impact is minimised , ' advise @entity16 's			1
@entity148 , ceo at @entity16 's , comments : ' etiquette is as relevant now as it 's ever been			1
shared economy businesses like @entity1 are very clever because by and large everyone wins – guests get more authentic travel experiences while the hosts can make money and strike up new friendships			0
it is , however , a relatively new phenomenon , and with that comes confusion regarding manners and behaviours			0
' the results of the @entity1 survey are interesting , and dovetail with our advice that manners are there to make everyone feel welcome , remove any anxiety , and minimise social difficulties or awkwardness			1
' it 's not difficult to be a great guest or host – you just need to make sure you 're fully engaged with the other person , give them your full attention , be courteous and be respectful			1
' infographic shows common faux pas to avoid to keep both guests and hosts happy			0
