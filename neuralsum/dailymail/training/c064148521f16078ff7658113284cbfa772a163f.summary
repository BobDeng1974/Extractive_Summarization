@entity2 ' @entity1 shots of herself smiling alongside her rare safari trophy kills may have been taken down , but she 's now replaced them with shots of herself alongside living animals as she struggles to repair her public image			1
despite the thousands of people who 've lashed out over @entity11 's photos , the teen scored a victory thursday when another account was removed for threatening her with violence			1
the move came after the 19 - year - old @entity18 cheerleader 's dad @entity16 demanded the removal of the page ' @entity21 ' that featured posts condemning the huntress as well as a picture of a lion smiling atop a dead hunter			1
public relations ? @entity11 , who 's said she 's gunning to get her own hunting tv show , has posted more sympathetic photos since the public outcry over her hunting shots but the victory may be short - lived			1
a second @entity11 page had already cropped up thursday afternoon as online petitions to stop the self - proclaimed hunting conservationist continued to draw global animal lovers ' signatures			2
@entity1 has deleted trophy photos showing rhinos , elephants , lions and leopards killed or tranquilized by the @entity18 cheerleader			1
@entity16 has sparked outrage across the social media site for sharing images of herself with the big game she has hunted through @entity52			2
fair game ? a mock facebook page called ' @entity21 ' cropped up in the wake of the controversy over a @entity59 teen college cheerleader 's @entity1 pictures featuring her rare @entity61 trophy kills ' credible threat ' : @entity1 removed this page by thursday despite initial claims from @entity11 's supporters that their calls to have it taken down had been rebuffed in a statement , @entity1 said it removes ' reported content that promotes poaching of endangered species , the sale of animals for organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse '			1
the decision sparked outrage from @entity16 ' father , who sent to tmz the response he got from @entity1 saying the @entity84 page could stay			1
@entity1 has since removed the page for representing a ' credible threat of violence ' toward the teen			1
following the removal of @entity11 's images , she shared a @entity93 montage of the deleted photos but by friday , there was no sign of the montage			2
removed : @entity1 had taken down this photo of @entity2 , 19 , with a lion that she hunted in @entity52			1
the social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards it came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging @entity1 ceo @entity109 to take down the photos in which @entity16 smiles proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from extinction			1
' for the sake of all animals , ' the petition against @entity16 reads as it implores animal lovers to sign , ' especially the animals in the @entity61 region ... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal ! ' after starting the social media firestorm , the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife			2
in a typo - laden defense that invokes the safari - loving 26th @entity130 president @entity129 , she claimed killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them			0
' this is a conservation effort to assure [ sic ] that they never do become extinct , ' the teen from @entity136 , @entity59 posted to @entity1			1
gone : @entity1 has also removed this image of her with an elephant			0
it said it removes ' content that promotes poaching of endangered species ... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse ' ' [ @entity129 ] was a hunter too , right ? he killed the same species that hunters now chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure			0
' yet , how can it be possible that someone can love the earth , and take from the @entity157 in the name of conservation ? for some folks , they 'll never understand			0
for the rest of us ... we were born that way			0
@entity165 , ' wrote @entity16			0
@entity16 , whose @entity1 indicates she ' is looking to host a tv show in january 2015 , ' said here is n't always space for threatened species like elephants or lions			1
' controlling the male lion population is important within large fenced areas like these , ' @entity16 writes			0
' funds from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their property			0
' ' this is a conservation effort ! ' : the @entity18 cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them @entity189 5 : @entity16 says her first kill was a rare african white rhino , part of her quest to bag the @entity61 game animals ( rhino , elephant , @entity198 , leopard and lion ) legal : the young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she 's doing is fine , since she pays the governments of @entity61 countries to kill the animals @entity16 ' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras , hugging a dead leopard , and smiling beside elephants she had killed			1
one particular photo , in which she posed alongside an extremely endangered rhinoceros , had her critics especially steaming , but the @entity18 cheerleader says it was alive and well			2
' the vet drew blood , took dna samples , took body and head measurements , treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics			0
i felt very lucky to be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the @entity233 population through conservation , ' she wrote			0
however , @entity16 has in her quest to bag the @entity61 game animals ( lion , elephant , @entity198 , leopard , and @entity240 / black rhinoceros ) shot a white rhino , which number around 20,000			2
because of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her dubious standing as a conservationist , some critics say @entity16 should be banned from hunting in @entity52 completely			2
pride : @entity16 learned how to hunt after she went with her father to @entity52 for his own hunts at age 9 ' cruelty ' : critics say she is not a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures boasts : ' this time i got my leopard , ' she wrote a safari when she was 14			0
' and also took down a hippo ' a second petition , this one on @entity268 and originating from @entity52 , is hoping to do just that			0
' @entity2 is an @entity130 born hunter who has entered the continent and has been hunting @entity61 wildlife under the facade of conservation , ' reads the petition			1
it continues : ' she has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless @entity61 animals as a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms			2
' but she also has her supporters			0
a @entity1 account , @entity285 , has also started			0
' support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in @entity52 , ' reads the page			0

@entity2 has drawn the ire of thousands with her @entity1 photos showing her smiling alongside rare @entity61 beasts
@entity1 removed the @entity84 page because it represented a ' credible threat of violence ' to the 19 - year - old @entity59
her own @entity1 images of dead elephants , hippos and lions , among others , were removed because they violate their standards
she 's replaced them with photos of herself posing with a *doe* and an adult deer
@entity16 , a cheerleader at @entity18 who is gunning for a *reality* show , claims her hunting is actually a conservation effort
