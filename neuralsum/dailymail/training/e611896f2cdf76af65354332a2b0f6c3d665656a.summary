@entity16 is brilliant with my kids and he is just a softie			1
' unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves			0
' she added : ' if i thought my dog was a danger to any kids or any other people i would n't be able to live with myself and i would n't put anybody 's life at risk			1
' if i even had one per cent doubt in my mind that he would turn he would be gone no matter how much i love him			0
' @entity16 did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although i accept it must have been scary for the postman			1
' anyone who knows my dog will say he does n't have it in him to hurt anyone			1
as soon as i shouted ' @entity16 stop ' and pulled him back he stopped straight away			1
it was n't a vicious attack because if it was he would not have let go of the postman			1
people are going to be mad about the post but there is no reason why they should n't deliver the post now			2
