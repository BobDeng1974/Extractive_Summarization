by @entity0 published : 10:50 est , 27 may 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 27 may 2013 an outspoken @entity2 politician apologized monday for saying @entity4 troops should patronize adult entertainment businesses as a way to reduce sex crimes , but defended another inflammatory remark about @entity2 's use of sex slaves before and during @entity11 @entity13 mayor @entity12 , co-leader of an emerging nationalist party , said his remarks two weeks ago rose from a ' sense of crisis ' about cases of sexual assaults by @entity4 military personnel on @entity2 civilians in @entity22 , where a large number of @entity4 troops are based under a bilateral security treaty			1
@entity12 also said he had not tried to condone a system of so - called comfort women , but meant to say military authorities at the time , not only in @entity2 but in many other countries , considered it necessary			1
' i understand that my remark could be construed as an insult to the @entity4 forces and to the @entity4 people ' and was inappropriate , he told a news conference at the @entity52 in @entity53			0
' i retract this remark and express an apology			0
' @entity12 , a lawyer and former tv personality , created an uproar with comments to journalists two weeks ago about @entity2 's modern and wartime sexual services , which he said were misquoted			1
the comments added to recent anger in neighboring countries that suffered from @entity2 's wartime aggression and have complained about a lack of atonement for the atrocities			2
@entity12 said then that the practice of using women from across @entity70 to work in front - line brothels before and during @entity11 was necessary to maintain discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers			1
he added that on a recent visit to the southern island of @entity22 , he suggested to the @entity4 commander there that his troops ' make better use ' of the legal sex industry ' to control the sexual energy of those tough guys			2
' on monday , @entity12 called the use of comfort women an ' inexcusable act that violated the dignity and human rights of the women , in which large numbers of @entity90 and @entity2 were included			1
' he did not mention women from other countries , such as @entity93 , the @entity94 and @entity95 , where many teenagers were forced into sex slavery			0
forgotten women : @entity12 failed to mention the @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity95 women also exploited as sex slaves during @entity102 , @entity94 former - comfort women march in 2004 to protest their wartime abuse an ' inexcusable act ' : historians estimate that the @entity2 military forced up to 200,000 women to act as prostitutes during @entity11 he said @entity2 must express deep remorse and apologize to the women			1
he repeatedly denied any intention to whitewash @entity2 's wartime responsibility			2
but he did n't apologize for those comments about @entity2 's wartime brothels , and insisted that the country 's wartime government did not systematically force girls and women into prostitution			1
historians say up to 200,000 women , mainly from the @entity123 and @entity93 , were forced to provide sex for @entity2 soldiers in military brothels			1
while some other @entity11 armies had military brothels , @entity2 is the only country accused of such widespread , organized sexual slavery			2
' if only @entity2 is blamed because of the widely held view that the state authority of @entity2 was intentionally involved in the abduction and trafficking of women , i will have to inform you that this view is incorrect , ' he said			0
@entity12 urged the government to clarify or revise @entity2 's landmark apology in a 1993 statement by then - chief cabinet secretary @entity142 to clearly state that @entity2 did not systematically force women into prostitution for its wartime military			1
the @entity142 apology acknowledged the military 's involvement , both direct and indirect , in the forced recruitment of the women			0
@entity12 said the apology does not say whether the operation was run under ' state will ' and that such murkiness has contributed to longstanding disputes between @entity2 and @entity155 over the issue			0
he raised doubts of accounts by some of the women who have come forward as victims of @entity2 's sexual slavery as reliable evidence of coercion			1
before taking office in december , prime minister @entity165 advocated revising the @entity142 apology , but now says he stands by it			0
@entity12 said he was quoted out of context in saying he believed that the use the system was necessary			0
he said he was trying to say that armed forces around the world ' seem to have needed women ' in past wars and had violated women 's human rights during wartime			0
singling out @entity2 was wrong , as this issue also existed in the armed forces of the @entity4 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and the @entity183 during @entity11 , he alleged , without elaborating			1
' based on the premise that @entity2 must remorsefully face its past offenses and must never justify the offenses , i intended to argue that other nations in the world must not attempt to conclude the matter by blaming only @entity2 and by associating @entity2 alone with the simple phrase of " sex slaves " or " sex slavery , " ' @entity12 said in a statement to journalists			2
@entity12 's suggestion to the @entity4 troops brought sharp criticism from @entity199			2
the @entity200 called @entity12 's comments ' outrageous and offensive			0
' @entity22 was invaded by @entity4 forces in @entity11 and has had an @entity4 military presence since			2
the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl by two @entity206 and a sailor spread rage across the island , and more rapes and other crimes linked to @entity4 servicemen over the years , along with military land use and aircraft noise , have caused longstanding anti- @entity4 military sentiment there			0
sense of crisis : @entity12 made the comments because of a ' sense of crisis ' over sex crimes committed by @entity4 soldiers stationed in @entity22 , where there has been a @entity4 military presence ever since @entity11 @entity12 , 43 , has become well known in recent years for his outspokenness			1
last year , he formed the @entity225 with former @entity53 gov. @entity226 , a strident nationalist			0
it is now an opposition party in parliament .			0

@entity13 mayor @entity12 took back his comment that @entity4 soldiers stationed in @entity22 should use brothels in order to reduce sex crimes
