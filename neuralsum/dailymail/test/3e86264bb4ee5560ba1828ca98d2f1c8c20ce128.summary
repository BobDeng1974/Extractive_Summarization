almost two weeks on from @entity1 ’s wretched afternoon against @entity2 at @entity3 , it would appear that lessons have already been learned			1
asked about a setback that may yet cost @entity8 and his players a place in next season ’s @entity11 , the club ’s midfielder @entity5 was rueful			1
‘ they were ready to go and maybe we were n’t , ’ @entity5 told a young supporter at @entity14 this week			1
‘ yeah , maybe the rivalry can sometimes get in the way			2
’ @entity5 battles it out with @entity20 during @entity1 's @entity22 defeat to @entity2 at @entity3 @entity1 midfielder @entity5 spoke to @entity24 's @entity23 at @entity1 's @entity14 training ground midfielder @entity5 believes @entity1 have performed well against the big teams during the last two seasons for @entity5 , and indeed for @entity1 , one suspects that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed as merely another kink in the road			1
certainly there is nobody at @entity3 who will accept the opinion offered by @entity37 ’ @entity38 , the former @entity2 defender , that @entity1 froze			1
‘ no , i do n’t think that ’s the problem , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ i think over the last two seasons we have performed against the big teams			1
games can just be like that sometimes			2
it does n’t happen very often			2
next time that game comes around we will get it right			2
’ over the past few months at @entity1 there has certainly been more right than wrong			1
going into saturday ’s game at @entity48 , they are five points off fourth place in the @entity22 but that still represents progress from the dark days of autumn and early winter			2
@entity5 , one senses , has been integral to recent improvement			1
with captain @entity57 no longer an automatic starter and the @entity59 @entity58 recently injured , the 25 - year - old midfielder has been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth			1
@entity5 has been given an opportunity with captain @entity57 no longer an automatic choice for @entity1 while @entity57 is no longer the first name on the teamsheet , @entity58 ( left ) has also been sidelined having arrived with @entity8 from @entity66 in 2012 , @entity5 could not always be relied on			1
he admitted this week that at times the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hopes that recent performances in big victories against @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity66 will one day be seen as evidence of a genuine breakthrough			1
‘ i think so , i hope so , ’ @entity5 told @entity24			1
‘ personally i have always been confident that i just needed games			2
‘ i will be open and honest , though			2
in my first season there were moments when i look back and am disappointed about how i did cope with that [ mental ] aspect of things			1
‘ maybe i underestimated it a little bit before i came			2
i tried to anticipate it but you ca n’t do it until you get here			2
now i have come through that and the only issue this season has been injuries			2
hopefully i can stay fit now and show people the best of me			1
’ @entity5 ’s increased standing at @entity1 saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporters this week			1
guest of honour was @entity96 , a volunteer at the @entity97 who was present at @entity14 as a ‘ @entity22 spirit of the game hero ’			2
during a 20 - minute q&a with a group of supporters , @entity5 talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when @entity57 announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season ’s title failure			1
‘ we understand that we gave it to @entity70 , ’ he said			0
@entity5 admits , at times , the challenge of playing for @entity1 felt a little too big but has impressed recently @entity57 consoles @entity111 as @entity1 's title hopes were dented against @entity113 last season @entity5 also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain @entity57 announced he would be leaving the @entity118 later on , however , his conversation with @entity24 was more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother @entity121 , a talented footballer who plays for the @entity123 deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis as a toddler			1
‘ when we were younger , he was a striker and he was a better player than me , ’ revealed @entity5			1
‘ at primary school i played with him and his mates and that gave me a little bit of a head start as they were two years older			0
‘ he is profoundly deaf but he speaks so well			0
i used to sign a little bit but he communicates so well now that i do n’t need to			0
‘ sibling rivalry is the perfect description of what we had , though			0
we loved playing against each other but there was a competitive edge to it			1
it ’s a while back but i guess that is where the path all started for me			0
‘ it ’s hard to say whether he would have made it - it is something that i do wonder about			0
but going out on to the pitch profoundly deaf is a huge disadvantage			0
so i do n’t know			0
it ’s one of those that we will never know the answer to … ’ home these days for @entity5 is the house he shares in @entity160 with his wife @entity161 and son @entity162			1
inherently private , he was a little embarrassed when @entity161 posted a photograph on @entity164 of last year ’s birthday present			0
then again a photograph of a top footballer holding a live chicken is rather unusual			0
@entity5 poses with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the @entity1 midfielder 's 24th birthday @entity5 's wife , @entity173 , shared the snap of @entity5 and his birthday present on @entity164 last year @entity5 poses with @entity96 , a volunteer at the @entity97 who was present at @entity14 as a ‘ @entity22 spirit of the game hero ’ ‘ it was just a “ what do you get the guy who has everything ? ” kind of present , ’ laughed @entity5 , fidgeting rather uncomfortably in his chair			1
‘ my wife is a big animal lover and it was , yeah , my surprise present			1
it has got a name but i ’m not telling you ! we already had a couple of chickens and this is a cockerel			0
that was the point of it really			0
in the dressing room , it ’s a bit of a random one			0
‘ i keep my private life private and i guess that was a rare insight			0
we did n’t realise what impact it would have but it was harmless enough			0
’ @entity5 was rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and , in particular , @entity123 ’s weekend win in @entity209 that left @entity211 ’s team at the top of their qualifying group for @entity214 was in @entity216 ’s @entity215 in 2004 when @entity218 ’s team lost a play - off to @entity220			1
now he wants to make some history with his country and finish off the work started by one of his early national coaches , the late @entity224			0
@entity5 is keen to make history with @entity123 and finish the work started by former manager , the late @entity224 ‘ his presence is still there for everyone , ’ @entity5 said poignantly			1
‘ he began this journey for us and his big dream was for us to qualify			2
in lots of ways we want to make sure we can do this for someone like @entity38			0
‘ he was a real people person			0
for a young midfielder going into the squad , he certainly had a huge impact on my career			2
‘ it was a huge win for us in @entity209 and we have a great chance now			0
for me it was the perfect thing to happen after the @entity2 result			0
‘ that ’s the beauty of football			0
there is always the next game to put things right			2
’ @entity5 played in the 3 - 0 win over @entity209 which took @entity123 to their top of their @entity256 qualifying group domestically , @entity1 ’s opportunity to make amends begins at the @entity259 tomorrow and continues in @entity260 next wednesday with an @entity262 quarter - final replay at @entity263			1
there is still much to aim for at @entity3 this season and , with @entity57 suspended for three games , opportunity continues to knock for one of the next generation			0
‘ whatever happened in one game has gone , ’ said @entity5			1
‘ we can start another run and do it again			0
that has to be our belief and confidence now			0
‘ last season we had a similar run			0
we have to use that to inspire us			0
if the teams above us do slip up then we will be waiting			0
’ @entity5 was speaking at a @entity22 event to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the game			1
