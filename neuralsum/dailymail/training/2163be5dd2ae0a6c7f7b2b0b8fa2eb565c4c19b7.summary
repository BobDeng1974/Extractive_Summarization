the blame game has started since @entity2 ’s mauling in @entity3 and nobody has been spared			1
@entity5 , only a few weeks into his reign at @entity7 , has been criticised for picking an inexperienced team , playing a system that is alien to his squad — and signing autographs immediately after that 4 - 0 defeat			1
@entity13 , sacked in april , had the spotlight on him			1
he was at fault , so the arguments went , because he was n’t brutal enough when he arrived last summer and failed to get rid of the players who were not up to @entity2 standard			1
under pressure : @entity5 has endured a rocky start to his reign as @entity2 manager shock : @entity2 were thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity24 in their @entity26 second - round tie the players have been blasted			1
so , too , have the @entity29 family and chief executive @entity30			2
but another figure has been embroiled in the post-mortem			0
when his name was mentioned , however , i found myself shaking my head in disbelief			0
he should have left a better squad , the theory goes			0
he left @entity2 weak because he did not sign better players and , as a result , his legacy is being damaged because @entity2 appear to be in freefall			1
@entity45 has claimed he will need a year to turn the situation			0
i find it remarkable anyone could genuinely feel @entity38 has anything to do with what is happening now			1
what we are actually seeing , with each passing week , is how far @entity38 ’s genius stretched and just how much of an impact he had on the club			1
blow : @entity57 scored the winner as @entity59 beat @entity2 2 - 1 at @entity7 on the opening day consider this : on august 28 , 2011 , @entity2 demolished @entity62 8 - 2 at @entity7			1
the performance was widely described as being ‘ spell - binding ’ and ‘ ruthless ’ and was the product of slick football			2
they terrorised @entity62 with the speed of their passing and movement			0
the team @entity38 selected that day was as follows : @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 : @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 : @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
three weeks later , the majority of that team lined up against @entity85 and beat them 3 - 1			2
makes you think , does n’t it ? of the xi who tackled @entity62 , all bar @entity76 started the current campaign at the club			0
some , such as @entity78 and @entity82 , could move before the transfer window closes on monday but three years ago they were being hailed as @entity2 ’s future			1
held back : despite @entity98 's goal , @entity2 were held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity100 it has to be said that some of the above named now look distinctly average but @entity38 got the best out of them			1
he had a unique ability to drive @entity2 on to win titles and squeeze every last drop out of his players			1
he drummed into them that they were the best and made them believe it			0
it was n’t just in matches			0
on a friday afternoon , you would hear opposition managers talking about what bottle of wine they intended bringing him , sounding beaten before they had turned up at @entity7			0
we all know he was partial to making comments about referees before big games			0
and there were times when i saw him waiting in the tunnel for the official			0
i made it my job to man - mark the referee so @entity38 could n’t bend his ear ! @entity2 always had a way of winning under @entity38 , even when they were not at their best			1
you had to fight to the last second for every point you took off them and you always knew how dangerous they were to cope with in the dying moments if a game was delicately poised			0
glittering : sir @entity38 ended his long reign at @entity7 with the title in 2013 how much was down to him ? more than you would think			1
last season , they scored seven times between the 81st and 90th minute — the period when they always seemed to get one more chance under @entity38 — but not one goal secured them a point			1
in 2012 - 13 , his final campaign , @entity2 scored 12 late goals			1
they were worth nine points			0
what @entity2 are discovering now is that they are in the real world			1
@entity38 distorted reality for the @entity29 and , in some way , the supporters through his ability to keep getting spectacular results on a consistent basis			1
he broke the @entity166 transfer record five times before the @entity29 came in 2005 but only did it once — for @entity168 — after they arrived			0
yet between 2007 and 2013 , @entity38 led them to the @entity169 five times			1
the years they missed out ( 2010 and 2012 ) , they had a chance to win it on the final day			2
misery : @entity13 was sacked after one season in which @entity2 missed out on the top four during a period in which @entity85 ’s @entity176 and @entity178 ’s @entity177 attempted to exert their financial power , to keep @entity2 ahead of the game without spending like their rivals was remarkable			1
at the start of this season , i said things would never be the same again for @entity2 and the £ 237.1million they have spent since @entity38 has gone into retirement is not going to recreate the success his teams enjoyed for over 20 years			1
it was only down to @entity38 that the @entity29 never had to spend like this before			1
one thing that is beyond doubt is that @entity2 — and football in general — are unlikely to see another like him			2
that ’s why i find it startling that his name was included in the recriminations that followed @entity2 ’s @entity26 capitulation			1
the only mistake @entity38 has made is underestimating just how good he actually was			2
@entity202 move is best option for @entity204 so @entity204 ’s time in @entity207 football is over and i am glad he is heading to @entity202			1
i have said in these pages before that i do n’t like to see players who are on big contracts sitting on the bench and hopefully a move to the @entity214 will revive his confidence			2
when @entity204 joined us at @entity217 in 2007 , he was in the top four strikers in world football			2
big , strong and quick , he used to leave defenders trailing and his goal return was magnificent			0
the end : @entity204 is heading to @entity202 on a two - year loan deal from @entity85 jumping for joy : torres in training with @entity85 at their base in @entity228 machine : the @entity230 earned a reputation as one of @entity234 's best strikers during his time at @entity217 clash : @entity237 was impressed by the character displayed by the @entity240 striker it was a joy to be on the same team as him during that period and what really impressed me about him was his character			1
he would stand up to defenders and was never someone who could be bullied out of a game			0
he could give as good as he got			0
the @entity225 who joined @entity85 in january 2011 , though , was not the same forward who arrived from @entity253 and we had seen the deterioration in him over his final 18 months at @entity256			0
appearances : 142 goals : 81 goals per game ratio : 1.8 matches cost per goal ( signed for £ 24m ) : £ 296,000 appearances : 172 goals : 45 goals per game ratio : 3.8 matches cost per goal ( signed for £ 50m ) : £ 1.1m lethal : @entity204 scored 81 goals in 142 games during his three and a half years at @entity217 strike : @entity204 holds off @entity270 to score in a 2 - 0 win over @entity2 at @entity256 in 2009 dry : the @entity230 only managed 45 goals for @entity85 after a £ 50m move to @entity275 slowing down : @entity204 ' pace was one of his biggest assets during his time at @entity217 he suffered some knee and hamstring injuries and when explosive players like him are hindered by such problems , it is difficult to recapture the spark			1
so much of @entity204 ’s game was based on his pace and he found himself unable to race away from defenders as he used to			2
people wondered why he could n’t do for @entity85 what he had initially done for @entity217 but we were never surprised			0
if anything , we were pleased with the £ 50million transfer fee we received for him , even if we did n’t reinvest it properly			0
@entity204 might not have scaled the heights that were expected of him in @entity296 but he still leaves with a collection of some of the game ’s biggest medals			2
it will be interesting to see if a switch to @entity303 revives his goalscoring talent			0
this week i 'm looking forward to seeing ... how @entity306 and @entity307 fare after being called into the @entity207 squad			0
while not many would have expected to see @entity309 include their names in his party for the games against @entity314 and @entity315 , @entity207 ’s manager will not have selected them on a whim			2
both players will find this weekend that they are judged differently , as the moment you are selected for @entity207 you find your games scrutinised like never before			0
it is important they handle all the extra attention			0
call up : @entity307 ( left ) and @entity306 ( right ) have been named in @entity309 's @entity207 squad @entity306 clearly has no issues over dealing with the mental side of the game			0
he made a big decision in moving from @entity100 to neighbours @entity330 but he has settled in quickly on @entity331 and uses the ball well			2
as for @entity307 , he should not be regarded as a surprise inclusion			0
he is someone who was talked about as having @entity207 potential 10 months ago and might have had a chance by now were it not for injury			0
he has been @entity336 ’s best player and both will be desperate to win their first caps at some point in the friendly against @entity314			2
before then , though , it will be interesting to see how @entity306 does against @entity342 and @entity307 gets on against @entity343 .			0

@entity2 without a win yet this season under @entity5
@entity2 were thrashed 4 - 0 by @entity24 in @entity26 second round
sir @entity38 stepped down as manager in 2013 after glittering reign
@entity13 was sacked after terrible first season in charge
moving to @entity202 is the right move for @entity204
