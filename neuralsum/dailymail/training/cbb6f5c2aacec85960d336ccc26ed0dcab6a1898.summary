by @entity1 reporter published : 19:45 est , 2 march 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 2 march 2013 a consortium from the @entity3 has launched the biggest ever takeover bid for a football club with an offer of £ 1.5bn for @entity8 side @entity7			1
the group , made up of investors from @entity11 and the @entity12 , hope to tempt @entity14 owner @entity13 with the world record sum , reports the @entity16			2
the mystery consortium members , who are apparently being backed by funds from @entity11 and the @entity12 , are to bid for every share in the club and have promised the money will be invested in the faltering team , who face a battle to qualify for next season 's lucrative @entity27 competition			1
money men : @entity7 majority owner @entity13 ( left ) and major shareholder @entity30 it blows out of the water the world 's previous highest bid for a football team the £ 800m was made by the @entity38 family for @entity39 and reinforces the growing power wielded by the @entity3 in the @entity42 game			1
@entity11 already own another leading @entity8 side , @entity43 , who are bankrolled by billionaire sheik @entity45 , while @entity47 club @entity46 , who recently signed @entity49 , are backed by the @entity50			1
@entity51 is the club 's majority shareholder , while @entity54 @entity30 also holds a significant stake			2
the cash offer for @entity7 would reportedly see the potential investors bid around £ 20,000 per share , making @entity13 's holding worth £ 830m , and wipe out the club 's £ 250m debts			1
a meeting has already been reportedly been requested with the @entity14 to discuss the proposed offer			0
another @entity11 , @entity62 ( middle ) , is in charge at @entity7 's rivals , @entity43 @entity49 's new club , @entity46 , are also bankrolled by @entity11 it is unlikely @entity30 will want to sell his shareholding , given his ' dream ' of taking control of @entity7 himself , but the @entity3 consortium believes it will be able to work with the billionaire , who does not currently have a seat on the board			1
any takeover would inevitably raise questions over the future of manager @entity79 but the @entity47 is understood to be highly - regarded by the consortium			0
a bid source was quoted as saying : ' @entity7 is at a pivotal position at the moment			2
the fear is that the club is facing a cycle of decline like @entity87			0
from our point of view it is the perfect moment to make this bid because at this moment in time you can still genuinely justify this extraordinary valuation on the club			0
big fans : the consortium want @entity7 manager @entity79 to stay on ' we will not bid for @entity7 if they go into decline			0
@entity13 and @entity30 will not get this kind of valuation if @entity7 do not succeed and will not get this kind of valuation ever again			0
' the amount of capital required to pump into @entity7 to make it competitive within @entity107 , @entity42 and the world means that the valuation can not go any higher			0

bid *dwarfs* previous record of £ 800m for @entity39 by @entity38 family
arabs already run @entity43 and @entity49 's @entity46
