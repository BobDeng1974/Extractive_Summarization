midfielder @entity0 has been rewarded for his contribution to @entity3 's bid for @entity5 football with a first call - up to the senior @entity8 squad			1
the 25 - year - old , who regularly represented his country at @entity11 and @entity12 19 levels , has been included in a provisional 35 - man party for the @entity16 qualifier against @entity17 at the @entity18 in @entity19 on march 29			1
manager @entity20 will reduce the initial squad before the players meet up on march 22 ahead of what could prove to be a key game in the qualification campaign , but there could yet be a place for a surprise inclusion in the shape of @entity0			1
@entity0 ( left ) has been called up to the @entity8 squad after impressing for @entity3 this season @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity32 ( @entity31 ) @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , @entity56 ( @entity41 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , @entity42 ( @entity43 ) , @entity44 ( @entity45 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity48 ( @entity39 ) , @entity49 ( @entity41 ) , @entity50 ( @entity36 ) , @entity51 ( @entity37 @entity0 ( @entity3 ) , @entity59 ( @entity58 ) , @entity60 ( @entity39 ) , @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity39 ) , @entity64 ( @entity65 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( all @entity47 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 ) @entity73 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , @entity77 ( @entity78 ) , @entity79 ( @entity58 ) , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , @entity82 ( @entity83 ) , @entity84 ( @entity45 ) , @entity85 ( @entity78 )			1
@entity20 said : ' he is having a very good season			2
i think , yeah , why not ? it would be nice to have a look at him			0
' he 's obviously played at under - age level and i wanted to introduce another fresh face			2
there are no guarantees of anything			0
i 've met him twice now and i think he deserves that chance			0
' this might be a surprise to him as i did n't say anything to him			0
he will hopefully be pleasantly surprised			0
' former @entity104 trainee @entity0 is currently in his fifth season with the @entity106 after joining them from @entity108 in june 2010 , and has scored six goals in 38 appearances to date during the current campaign			2
@entity3 head into the weekend having returned to the top of the @entity115 table as a result of their 5 - 1 victory at @entity119 last weekend , but only on goal difference with @entity41 , @entity121 and @entity122 all level with them on 66 points and @entity72 just a point behind			1
@entity47 midfielder @entity68 and @entity39 counterpart @entity63 have been included , although @entity68 in particular is struggling with a torn calf muscle , while former @entity83 winger @entity63 is nursing a bruised knee			2
@entity0 has been the driving force behind @entity3 's quest for promotion to the @entity5 but there was no place for @entity36 's @entity133 , who is yet to make up his mind over whether to opt for @entity8 or @entity135 , a process which has been ongoing for some time to the particular frustration of @entity20 's assistant and former @entity36 number two @entity139			1
the @entity17 game could prove crucial to the @entity8 's hopes of making it to the finals in the wake of november 's 1 - 0 @entity146 defeat in @entity147			1
@entity20 's men opened their campaign with victories in @entity151 and at home to @entity153 , and a 1 - 1 draw in @entity155 in october boosted their hopes of claiming second spot with the reigning world champions expected to recover from a less - than - impressive start by their lofty standards			0
however @entity17 , who were expected to rival the @entity162 and the @entity163 for the runners - up spot , currently enjoy a three - point lead over @entity155 , @entity147 and @entity166 at the top of the table having beaten the @entity155 2 - 0 in @entity168 during october , only to be held to a 2 - 2 draw by @entity171 's men three days later			1
@entity20 said : ' @entity17 are a very strong team , they 've obviously got off to a great start			2
confidence is obviously very high there			0
they look up to the task			0
it will be a tough game for us			0
