the evolution of hind legs actually began as enhanced fins , according to a new study			0
researchers came to the conclusion after discovering well - preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin ( pictured , centre ) from a 375 million - year - old fossil of a transitional species named @entity9 ( reconstruction pictured left ) the fossils are described by scientists in the journal @entity29			1
corresponding author of the study doctor @entity32 , of the @entity33 , said : ' previous theories , based on the best available data , propose that a shift occurred from ' front - wheel drive ' locomotion in fish to more of a ' four - wheel drive ' in tetrapods			0
' but it looks like this shift actually began to happen in fish , not in limbed animals			0
' discovered in 2004 by @entity45 and co-authors dr @entity47 , associate curator of @entity49 at the @entity50 , and the late doctor @entity51 , @entity9 roseae represents the best - known transitional species between fish and land - dwelling tetrapods			1
a lobe - finned fish with a broad flat head and sharp teeth , @entity9 looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile , growing up to a length of nine feet as it hunted in shallow freshwater environments			2
this illustration of @entity9 reveals its transitional fin that eventually gave way to hind legs it had gills , scales and fins , but also had tetrapod - like features such as a mobile neck , robust ribcage and primitive lungs			1
in particular , its large forefins had shoulders , elbows and partial wrists , which allowed it to support itself on ground			2
however , only specimen blocks containing the front portion of @entity9 have been described up until now			2
as the researchers investigated additional blocks recovered from their original and subsequent expeditions to the dig site in northern @entity89 , they discovered the rear portion of @entity9 , which contained the pelves as well as partial pelvic fin material			1
the fossils include the complete pelvis of the original ' type ' specimen , making a direct comparison of the front and rear appendages of a single animal possible			2
the scientists were immediately struck by the pelvis , which was comparable to those of some early tetrapods			0
the @entity9 pelvic girdle was nearly identical in size to its shoulder girdle , a tetrapod - like characteristic			1
it possessed a prominent ball and socket hip joint , which connected to a highly mobile femur that could extend beneath the body			0
crests on the hip for muscle attachment indicated strength and advanced fin function			0
and although no femur bone was found , pelvic fin material - including long fin rays - indicate that the hind fin was at least as long and as complex as its forefin			1
dr @entity47 said : ' this is an amazing pelvis , particularly the hip socket , which is very different from anything that we knew of in the lineage leading up to limbed vertebrates			2
' @entity9 was a combination of primitive and advanced features			0
here , not only were the features distinct , but they suggest an advanced function			0
they appear to have used the fin in a way that 's more suggestive of the way a limb gets used			0
' according to scientists , @entity140 were still clearly fish - like , but the expanded size , mobility and robusticity of the pelvis , hip joint and fin of @entity9 made a wider range of movements possible			1
dr @entity32 added : ' it 's reasonable to suppose with those big fin rays that @entity9 used its hind fins to swim like a paddle			1
' but it 's possible it could walk with them as well			0
african lungfish living today have similarly large pelves , and we showed in 2011 that they walk underwater on the bottom			0
' regardless of the gait @entity9 used , it 's clear that the emphasis on hind appendages and pelvic - propelled locomotion is a trend that began in fish , and was later exaggerated during the origin of tetrapods			1

researchers discovered a well - preserved pelvis and a partial pelvic fin from the fossil of a transitional species called @entity9
bones hint at a limb - like appendage that helped the *ancient* creature move
the find challenges the existing theory that large , mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land
