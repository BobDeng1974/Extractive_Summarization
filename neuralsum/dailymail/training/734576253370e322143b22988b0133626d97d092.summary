by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 19 july 2012 a gay couple are thought to have become the first in the @entity3 to hold a civil partnership ceremony in a church building			1
@entity6 and @entity7 made a commitment to each other at the @entity10 , in @entity11 , last month and are currently enjoying their honeymoon			1
the couple , who described the event as a ' milestone for equality ' , only received council approval that the church could register civil partnerships a week before their big day			1
plans to allow religious buildings to host civil ceremonies were announced last february but the legislation was only implemented in december after public consultation			2
@entity6 , 41 , who runs a youth group , said : ' the pace of change is extraordinarily remarkable , but there is still work to be done			1
life partners : @entity6 and @entity7 have become the first gay couple to hold a civil ceremony in a religious building , but do other want the same ? ' there has been a lot of controversy over the government ’s consultation over the equality of marriage and civil partnerships			1
' when we booked our blessing over a year ago we had no idea this would be possible			0
we are delighted to have achieved this milestone on the road to equality			1
' the couple , from @entity49 , @entity11 , have been together for four - and - a - half years and met through their involvement in groups for gay people of faith			1
@entity7 , 36 , an administrator originally from @entity55 , said : ' bringing the two elements together means we are able to integrate our sexuality and our spirituality , to celebrate our love for each other and our love of @entity62			1
' around 150 people attended the service at the grade i - listed building , where @entity66 , the lay minister , of the @entity10 led the blessing service and the couple made a commitment to each other			1
@entity66 , said : ' many of our unitarian churches have conducted blessings for same sex couples , either to complement a legal civil union or simply to affirm a relationship , for many years			2
' we are so pleased to have the first civil partnership on religious premises , but we will continue striving for all couples to have equal access to civil marriages , religious marriages and civil partnerships			1
' the @entity85 is traditionally a far more liberal @entity87 tradition than the @entity88 and the @entity89			0
they proclaim to be an open community celebrating diverse beliefs that does not discriminate ' on grounds of gender , age , race , religion or sexual orientation '			0
last month ’s ceremony is understood to have contained elements of both the @entity89 and @entity88 traditions			2
@entity6 said there was a ' lot of ignorance and fear ' around the issues of same - sex marriages but the @entity10 had been very welcoming			1
registrar @entity108 said : ' i am delighted that the couple got what they wanted - a religious celebration and legal recognition			2
' the chief executive of lesbian , gay and bisexual charity @entity118 , @entity114 said : ‘ this is an important matter of religious freedom and tolerance			1
' faiths like the @entity126 , the @entity122 and @entity123 and @entity124 are committed to celebrating unions between loving and committed same - sex couples , which is why @entity118 lobbied hard to make sure religious groups can celebrate civil partnerships if they wish			1
' @entity6 and @entity7 are pioneers , and we send them our very best wishes			1
we hope to see many more registrations take place in tolerant places of worship in the years ahead			0
' @entity138 : @entity6 and @entity7 held their blessing service in a church legislation allowing such same - sex ceremonies in churches was brought in as part of @entity146			1
but the @entity88 , the country ’s largest denomination , has refused to allow civil partnerships , while the @entity89 ’s views on homosexuality has stood in the way of same - sex ceremonies in its churches			2
the government has begun a consultation on allowing gay couples in @entity157 and @entity158 to marry			0
but the proposal is fiercely opposed by some senior church figures , as well as a number of conservative mps			0
civil partnerships , introduced in 2005 , give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples			2
but the government wants them to be legally allowed to make vows and declare they are married before the next general election , due in 2015			0
@entity171 threw his weight behind the proposals in a speech to last year ’s @entity176 conference			0
the prime minister ’s parliamentary secretary @entity177 has also backed the plans			0
he said marriage was a blessing he wants extended to everyone and added : ‘ i have come at this issue of equal marriage principally because i ’m a @entity87			0
’ but a number of @entity176 mps have voiced their opposition to the measures and a poll by @entity190 found that 70 per cent of the public want to keep the current definition of marriage			0
@entity194 from @entity195 said : ' we are happy that this wedding has taken place as long as the church has not been in anyway coerced into performing the ceremony			2
' we accept that some churches will choose to hold them as they already do in @entity203			0
but we are strongly opposed to anyone forcing churches to perform same sex marriages against their will			0
' the proposed reform of the marriage laws , on which consultation will finish this month , would cover only civil marriages for gay and lesbian couples and would not affect religious marriages or offer heterosexual couples the option of civil partnerships			1
the reform would have the force of law in @entity157 and @entity158 , but not @entity221 or @entity222			0
under the plans , lesbian and gay couples who are already in civil partnerships will be offered the option of an ' upgrade ' to civil marriage status			2
launching the proposals , the equalities minister , @entity228 , described marriage as a celebration of love that should be available to everyone			0
' i believe that if a couple love each other and want to commit to a life together , they should have the option of a civil marriage , whatever their gender , ' she said			2
* in a previous version of this article words normally reserved for traditional marriage and not civil partnerships were used			0
the terminology has now been amended .			0
