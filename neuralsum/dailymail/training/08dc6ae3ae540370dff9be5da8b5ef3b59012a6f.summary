by @entity0 there ’s nothing quite like biting into a warm , soft cookie oozing with chocolate			0
@entity5 has spent decades trying to create the perfect recipe , but often no two batches are ever the same			0
now , in his quest to create a flawless confectionary , an engineer from @entity9 has developed what could be the holy grail of cookie - making			2
using specially - designed software , the recipe of every single cookie can be tweaked to different preferences @entity16 has created a machine that mixes the perfect amount of each baking ingredient to make a single cookie			1
using specially - designed software , the recipe of every single cookie can be tweaked to different preferences			2
for those who like their cookie chewier , they move the slider on the software which sends a signal to the machine to release more flour			0
@entity16 has developed a machine that mixes the perfect amount of each baking ingredient to make a single cookie the single - serving cookie machine claims to measure the ingredients completely accurately each time			1
‘ this machine allows me to mix a single cookie and vary the recipe for each cookie on the sheet , ' said mr @entity16 in his blog			2
' hence , i can test many different recipe variations with one batch of ingredients in one afternoon ’ this machine would be welcome news to serious eats chief creative officer @entity52 who last month baked 1,536 cookies in his quest to find his personal perfect chocolate chip cookie			1
but for some , a major downside is that the machine creates only one cookie at a time			1
this means you ’ll no longer be able to secretly feast on those cookies that ‘ did n’t make the grade ’			0
using specially - designed software , the recipe of every single cookie can be tweaked to different preferences			0

@entity16 developed the machine which creates one cookie at a time
ratio of ingredients can be changed each time using a *computer* *program*
' i can test many different recipe variations with one batch of ingredients in one afternoon ’ said the @entity9 - based *inventor*
