they were the 18th century equivalent of a glitzy night out at the @entity2 , beloved by the great , the good and the royal			0
but while today 's society parties are fuelled by nothing more than alcohol , @entity5 ' @entity4 ' were decidedly risqué - to say the least			1
now the @entity5 love of public fancy dress promenades is the focus of a display at the @entity13 , with beautiful colour plates revealing a glamorous - and seedy - side of 18th century life			1
entertaining : the jubilee ball of 1759 was held in front of the house and rotunda at @entity21 @entity4 were large areas of land made for lavish entertainment , which first became popular following the restoration in 1660 and remained so until well into the 19th century			1
fringed by elaborate colonnades , the elaborate public spaces , most of which were in @entity31 , were a place to see and be seen and the location for everything from balls to public breakfasts , fireworks displays and , most infamous of all , masquerade balls			1
' the popularity of fancy dress seems to coincide with periods when the structures of society are very rigid , to provide a relief from strict hierarchies , ' explains curator @entity46			0
' but masquerades are also popular in times when society is in flux or our notions of gender are changing			0
illicit : walks like those seen in this 1750 depiction of @entity21 were seen as hotbeds of illicit romance @entity60 : the costumes worn by revellers , in particularly the female ones , tended to be revealing fan : as @entity65 , the future @entity65 adored attending masked balls and masquerades ' the latter was probably the case in the second half of the eighteenth century , with the rise of the middle classes and their different perception of the role of men and women			1
' at the balls , revellers , among them the future @entity65 , would dress up in a variety of revealing outfits and dance the night away - often going home with partners who were n't their spouses			1
unsurprisingly , the antics of @entity4 revellers led to outrage in some quarters , with many commentators pointing to disguise as a means of indulging in all kinds of debauchery without being recognised			2
and they were n't entirely wrong			0
one of the most scandalous events of the 18th century took place at the @entity97 of 1749			0
@entity98 ( later the @entity99 of @entity100 ) , appeared as the tragic iphigenia of ancient @entity103 mythology , undressed for sacrifice , in a costume so transparent she appeared almost naked			2
@entity98 certainly was n't the only one			0
according to @entity46 , women often used masquerade balls as a means of dispensing with the restrictive fashions of the day , replacing them with ensembles that were both more comfortable and less concealing			1
as a result , milkmaid styles with their shorter skirts and low bodices became hugely popular as did sweeping @entity118 styles , including harem pants			1
' masquerades allowed trying out different roles but also , on a more prosaic level , gave licence for wearing more revealing clothes , ' explains @entity46			2
' popular ‘ characters ’ were shepherdesses and milkmaids which allowed wearing shorter skirts , revealing some leg			1
' costumes inspired by @entity118 dress , involving the use of trousers , were also popular			1
and apparently some women event went as far as dressing as men			0
' worse still , in the moralist 's eyes , were the many dark nooks within the gardens , all of which - whether mazes or shaded walks - lent themselves to secret romances and extracurricular liaisons			2
particularly notorious was @entity145 ’ @entity146			0
' the most experienced mothers have often lost themselves in looking for their daughters , ' noted society commentator @entity149 of the walkway in 1700 ’ elaborate : although in theory open to all classes , balls were very much the preserve of the upper classes striking : an entrance ticket for the @entity157 festivities of 1786 ( left ) and a scene inside the gardens the gardens were known to be rife with prostitution , while @entity162 mentions in his diaries ‘ young gallants misbehaving and insulting the ladies ’			1
drunken nights fuelled gossip and excitement that was widely reported in newspapers and periodicals			0
' the @entity4 were said to be swarming with prostitutes and while in 1766 " pickpockets , sharpers , and common prostitutes " were indeed caught executing " the respective branches of their trades " , sometimes one wonders whether the talk of loose woman was a marketing ploy by the owner of @entity157 , ' says @entity46			0
but while the many prostitutes fuelled scandal , what was even worse in society 's eyes was the idea of different classes mixing			0
' the owners of the @entity4 were aware of the confusion that masquerade outfits could bring and usually were strict in not allowing any actual masks to be worn , ' explains @entity193			2
' what was most feared was a mingling of the different strata of society and on one occasion one journalist remarked that " several of the music " , had mixed with the rest of the company - a sign of " rudeness and impropriety of conduct "			0

@entity4 became a popular part of @entity31 life from 1660 *onwards*
the gardens were the site of risqué masquerade parties and masked balls
*critics* *accused* them of fuelling prostitution and *encouraging* illicit affairs
women often chose revealing milkmaid or ' @entity118 - style ' ensembles
in 1749 , a guest arrived wearing a costume so diaphanous , she looked naked
