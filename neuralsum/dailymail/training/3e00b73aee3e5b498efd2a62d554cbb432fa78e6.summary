the pilots of a helium - filled balloon who have embarked on a daring flight across the @entity4 have drawn closer to @entity5 as they attempt to break two world records			1
@entity7 of @entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 are expected to cross into @entity5 sometime thursday evening			1
the accomplished balloon pilots are on course to break a distance record that has stood for more than three decades			1
they 're also looking to break the flight - duration record set in 1978			1
during their voyage , they will cross over the @entity31 @entity30 and land somewhere in the northern @entity33 , possibly @entity34 or @entity35 , on saturday morning			0
the last time that anyone crossed the @entity4 in a gas balloon was in 1981			1
but to break the distance record , the balloonists need to exceed the current records by one percent to claim a new world record			2
that means they need to travel 5,260 miles to break the mark			2
another important record is the duration of the flight , set in 1978 when @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 made the first trans - @entity52 balloon flight			1
that record of 137 hours in the air in a traditional gas balloon is considered the ' holy grail ' of ballooning achievements			1
the pilots on the current flight are at about 100 hours			2
pilot : @entity7 and @entity9 will pilot their helium - filled balloon from @entity20 in a bid to break a distance record of 5,208 miles ( 8,381 kilometers ) if they get that far , the team will notify the @entity66 of its claim within seven days of landing			1
all the documentation will be forwarded to the @entity71 for consideration			0
the process can take weeks , but the team will have plenty of data to present since the balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments			0
in a visible sign of the progress , the tracking monitors at mission control in @entity8 switched to showing @entity33 cities as the closest landmarks wednesday			0
record breaking : the pilots also want to break the flight - duration record of 137 hours set in 1978 when @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 made the first trans - @entity52 balloon flight ' that just made it very real that we 're getting close , ' team member @entity92 said			1
but not even the pilots know where they will land			0
it depends on the winds encountered along the way			0
the balloon 's speed has slowed significantly , which is something forecasters had expected			0
the balloon , made up of a massive envelope and a specially - designed carbon fiber - composite capsule , is capable of staying aloft for as many as 10 days			2
the team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there 's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down			0
a network of balloonists have been established across the @entity33 and in southern @entity31 who can serve as chase crews , those who are on the ground to help with tethering the capsule and rounding up the balloon 's envelope as it deflates			0
the volunteers are ready to travel within a 200 - mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear .			0

the pilots of a helium - filled balloon have drawn closer to @entity5
@entity7 and @entity9 hope to smash the world records
the last time anyone crossed the @entity4 in a gas balloon was 1981
they 're also looking to break the flight - duration record first set in 1978
