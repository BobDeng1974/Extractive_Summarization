pretty spot : queen @entity1 spent her holidays in @entity3 on the @entity4 ' it is impossible to imagine a prettier spot , ’ queen @entity1 said of her holiday residence , @entity3 on the @entity4			1
it was at the beach there that she would take to the sea in her wooden bathing machine , and that all of her children learned to swim			0
but , however pleasing her days at @entity3 , @entity1 ’s journeys there were never easy			1
she would travel to @entity17 by train and then by ferry to @entity20			2
from @entity20 there was a railway line that passed not far from @entity3 but the nearest station was at @entity24 , more than two miles from the property			1
so , in 1875 , a station was built at @entity27 , the closest point on the line to @entity3 – just to serve the royal residence			1
accommodation was built for the stationmaster , as well as waiting rooms with toilets for both ladies and gentlemen			0
the building is now a five - bedroom family home , currently on the market for £ 625,000 , while the track has become a cycle path			1
@entity1 died in 1901 and the station went into public use in 1903			1
however , services ended in 1966 , after which the station was converted into a home			2
the current owners , retired electrician @entity49 , 69 , and his 70 - year - old wife @entity51 , a retired hairdresser , are selling because they want to move to a smaller bungalow			0

royal connection : the home that was once a railway station built to serve the monarch ‘ we are very sad to leave our unique home and its gardens , which have given us many years of pleasure			1
it ’s been a lovely family home			0
’ it is thought that @entity1 @entity1 , who , famously , would not allow herself to be conveyed at more than 40 miles per hour , would wait at @entity66 in the room that is now used as a sitting room			2
@entity1 , and those who visited her on the @entity4 , would be taken by horse and carriage from @entity27 station to @entity3			1
in 1900 , @entity27 station made another piece of history , with the appointment of a stationmistress , rather than master – almost unheard of at the time			2
@entity79 took over the role from her father - in - law			0
immensely proud of being in sole charge of the station , she would dress in a white starched apron over a black dress , and would sport a straw boater hat			0
spacious : the large , open - plan kitchen in the @entity4 property , which has five bedrooms the part of the house now used as a sitting room used to be the station ’s waiting room , while the main bedroom used to be the points room , where the signalman would pull levers to control trains on the track			1
where the main platform once stood there is now a lawn that leads down to an @entity106 garden , with raised beds , a rockery , an orchard and a small woodland beyond			0
@entity111 £ 625,000 @entity27 , @entity4 @entity112 5 unique features former train station built for @entity1 @entity1 to reach @entity3 ; sitting room that @entity1 used as a waiting room ; main bedroom that used to be a points room			1

to the left of the driveway is a common meadow with wild orchids			0
the property is also very versatile : alongside its five bedrooms , it has four reception rooms , a conservatory , a kitchen / dining room , a utility room , three shower rooms , a family bathroom and a downstairs cloakroom			0
‘ this is a wonderful home which holds a great deal of character and warmth , as well as its own slice of history , ’ says @entity137 , sales manager at @entity138			0
‘ it could meet a number of needs : it could be a home to serve the requirements of two or even three generations of the same family ; a holiday home ; or a combination of the two			2
‘ one thing is for certain here – the choices are plenty within this amazing property , and it certainly delivers substantial levels of charm and appeal			0
