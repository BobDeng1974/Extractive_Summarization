by @entity0 published : 17:18 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 17:19 est , 4 july 2012 a new backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases has been uncovered by inspectors in the latest border shambles			1
the total – which is about the same as the population of @entity7 – is increasing by nearly 100 every day			1
it is made up of migrants whose visas allowing them to stay in @entity11 have expired and who have been refused permission to stay on			1
a report has revealed the @entity15 has a backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases but border officials have no idea if they have actually left the country or are still living here illegally			1
and inspectors found the beleaguered @entity15 has no plan for finding out how many remain , or taking action to remove those who are still here			2
in 40 per cent of cases examined by inspectors , the migrants had not even been sent a letter telling them they must quit @entity11			1
the ' significant ' new backlog emerged in a report by @entity31 , the chief inspector of the @entity15			2
the report , published today , revealed that in mid-december , the total number of cases in the @entity35 across the @entity11 stood at 159,313			1
in the preceding two months , it had increased by 5,492 – or nearly 100 cases a day			0
cases put in the pool were foreign students or workers here legally who applied for their visas to be extended but were refused , and told they must leave within 28 days			0
immigration minister @entity43 , pictured at @entity44 of @entity45 , said : ' we are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the @entity11 illegally			1
' mr @entity31 said urgent action was needed to tackle it because , currently , tracking down and removing such illegal migrants was not seen as a priority			0
' ' the agency does not know how many of these individuals have left the country or who are waiting to be removed , ' he said			2
' i also saw no evidence that there is a clear plan in place for the agency to deal with this stream of work to ensure this does not become another backlog			0
' @entity69 officials last night refused to say what the total is now , saying they would not provide a ' running commentary '			2
sir @entity73 , chairman of the think - tank @entity74 , said : ' it is vital to the credibility of the whole immigration system that people who have no right to be in @entity11 should be removed			1
' there clearly needs to be a much greater focus on this			0
it is absurd , for example , that people who overstay should not even be contacted to be told to go			0
' ' i am astonished that the @entity15 has no idea where 159,000 individuals – the size of a city like @entity7 – have gone since their application was rejected			1
' @entity94 mp @entity93 the report looked specifically at immigration officials in @entity97 and the @entity98 , where immigration officials massively underestimated the number of such cases in their area			2
they put the total at between 400 to 600 but the real total was 1,893 , more than three times higher			0
a detailed examination of a sample of cases revealed barely half were recorded as having left the country , and only one had been forcibly removed			2
others had launched new appeals or could not be removed because of human rights or legal barriers			0
in 40 per cent of cases migrants were not even sent the legal letters telling them they must leave the country			0
the report said : ' the issue is a national problem			0
we believe the agency needs to be much more pro-active in providing a clear strategic direction for its staff to follow			0
this should stop the already significant backlog from increasing and ensure steps are taken to reduce it			0
' immigration minister @entity43 said : ' under the last government there was no effective strategy in place to ensure migrants left at the end of their time in the @entity11			1
' the @entity15 is now working through a group of potential over-stayers to identify those who have not left			2
we are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the @entity11 illegally			1
' @entity93 , chairman of the @entity145 home affairs select committee , said : ' i am astonished that the @entity15 has no idea where 159,000 individuals – the size of a city like @entity7 – have gone since their application was rejected			1
this is yet another group of cases we did not know about			0

@entity157 is about the same as the population of @entity7
border officials have no idea if they have left the @entity11
