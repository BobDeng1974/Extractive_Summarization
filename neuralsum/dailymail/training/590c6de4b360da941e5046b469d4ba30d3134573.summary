it would literally never occur to me			0
’ according to the magazine , mr @entity47 welled up as he told how he fell in love at first sight when he and @entity8 were students in @entity52			1
‘ it was total thunderbolt stuff , ’ he said before @entity53 - born mrs @entity8 , a successful lawyer who uses her maiden name @entity55 professionally , interrupted to say : ‘ oh no , this is going to get embarrassing			1
’ mr @entity47 went on : ‘ ( @entity8 was wearing ) this dark green velvet thing			1

and i was this pimply @entity64 , trying to impress her … ’ the couple are pictured in their @entity67 card			0
the @entity34 leader told @entity39 magazine he would never try to use her for publicity he explained that at first their language of love was pidgin @entity74 , as he did n’t speak @entity53 and her @entity75 was ‘ not very strong ’			1
