proud : the men also added to it the elite squadron ’s badge and the ' he who dares , @entity100 ' motto comrades : men of the @entity103 ( the @entity3 ) returning from a 3 - month trip behind enemy lines during war in @entity21 - is was in the same area that trooper @entity13 seized the @entity5 flag @entity109 , from @entity111 auctioneers of @entity112 , @entity113 , which is selling it , said : ' this is a fascinating relic from the war , taken as it was by the very early @entity3			1
