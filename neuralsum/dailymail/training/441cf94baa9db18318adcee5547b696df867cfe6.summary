a @entity1 pensioner has been left scarred for life following a botched facelift			1
@entity4 was awarded more than £ 43,000 in compensation after her life was ' almost ruined ' by a procedure carried out in 2010			1
after the operation , the 69 - year - old developed necrosis - a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds			1
@entity4 developed necrosis after her facelift performed by an @entity18 surgeon in 2010 but despite a court finding in favour of mrs @entity4 and awarding compensation , she says she still has n't received a penny and the surgeon , from @entity18 , is still believed to be operating in the @entity24			1
mrs @entity4 , from @entity25 , @entity1 , took her civil case to a county court hearing in april , where a judge awarded costs against the surgeon for negligence			1
now she is calling for the government to take action over ' seagull surgeons ' - foreign doctors who fly into the @entity24 and undertake procedures before returning home			1
should problems arise following surgery , it is often difficult and expensive to pursue restitution for patients			1
' this might sound dramatic to people , but this has almost ruined my life , ' said mrs @entity4			1
' i always took pride in my appearance and over the years i went from having lots of photos of myself around the house , to having none			0
' i had talked about having a facelift but they are expensive and we did n't have the money			2
my kids had always talked about buying one for me and one year my daughter @entity59 , who has her own business , was able to do just that			0
' despite being awarded £ 43,000 in compensation @entity4 has yet to received any of the money the company which organised the £ 8,000 facelift has now gone into administration			1
the centre introduced mrs @entity4 to an @entity18 surgeon before she underwent the procedure at a hospital in @entity71			1
necrosis is literally the body 's cells dying prematurely			2
this tissue death can occur anywhere on the body and is usually caused by an external factor such as injury , infection , or chemicals			0
if a substantial area of tissue dies completely the condition is know as gangrene			2
treatment involves the removal of the dead tissue , keeping the area clean , and antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy where suitable			0
she added : ' he never talked about necrosis at all			2
he talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis			2
i just remember him saying that he would make me happy			0
' when they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much , i screamed and it started to go purple			2
it went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather			0
' the company contacted the surgeon in @entity18 and he arranged an emergency appointment with mrs @entity4			1
she said : ' when he saw me he took me straight into a treatment room and said it had to be treated like first degree burns			0
he told me he was so sorry and that it did not happen very often			0
' he offered laser treatment which i had and he said he would do everything he could to make it better and put it right			0
that is the last we have ever heard from him			0
' clinical negligence lawyer @entity127 , of law firm @entity128 , is now pursuing the case			0
she said : ' i am aware of ' seagull surgeons ' but have not come across the issue to such a horrific degree			1
he does have insurers but because he has not notified them of the incident , they will not cover him			0
@entity4 , pictured here with @entity128 clinical negligence lawyer @entity127 ( left ) wants to warn others about ' seagull surgeons ' ' his residency outside of the @entity24 should n't , in theory , make a difference			1
what it means is we can get a judgement here but it has to be enforced abroad which can be expensive			1
if there are no assets in the @entity24 , you can not enforce here and it has to be pursued abroad			2
' mrs @entity4 is now urging anyone contemplating surgery to undertake extensive checks			2
she added : ' surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances			0
' clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use			0
' i would not want ( this ) to happen to another single person			0

@entity4 developed necrosis after facelift performed by an @entity18 surgeon
condition , where cells die , left her in agony and her face scarred
was awarded more than £ 43,000 in compensation in court
has yet to receive a penny as her doctor has returned to @entity18
it is much more expensive and difficult to enforce a judgement abroad
@entity4 wants to warn others about so - called ' seagull surgeons '
