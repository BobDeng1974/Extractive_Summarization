by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 07:43 est , 30 august 2013 a newly discovered species of shark that ' walks ' along the sea floor to hunt for its next meal , has been discovered and filmed by scientists			1
in the intriguing video , the spotty fish , which is a type of bamboo shark , uses its front four fins to crawl along the sea floor in a clever technique to sneak up on its prey off the islands of @entity16			0
it has been named @entity18 after the group of sharks it is closely related to and also the place it was found , the eastern @entity25 island of @entity26			1
see the footage below ... a newly discovered species of shark that ' walks ' along the sea floor to hunt for its next meal , has been discovered by scientists the shark , which is harmless to humans , grows up to 27 inches in length and two specimens , which differed slightly in colour , were spotted hugging the sea floor to search for small fish and invertebrates to feast on at night			1
a video captured the creature 's unusual hunting habits at the @entity44 on one of the @entity25			2
@entity46 , a coral reef ecologist and marine conservationist , filmed the shark on the small island of @entity26 and said his team were very excited at the discovery			0
he said : ' local indigenous communities have been aware of the shark for many generations - but it only came to the attention of science once diving began to take off in the region			2
it has been named @entity18 after the group of sharks it is closely related to and also the place it was found , the eastern @entity25 island of @entity26 ' walking sharks are an excellent ambassador for marine conservation and for the conservation of sharks in general			1
dr @entity68 , a biologist at @entity69 , led the team that found the fish , whose research is published in the @entity73			0
its unusual wriggling ' walking ' action could help scientists understand how some of the first animals evolved from living in the sea to walking on land			0
before now similar types of shark had been confined to the island of @entity85 and northern @entity86 and scientists from @entity16 and @entity86 are now working to find a connection between the species			2
it is thought the species could help save the shark population in the area			0
@entity16 is well known for exporting shark fins as food or medicine but this discovery comes alongside an announcement by the government to increase marine tourism and conservation			1
@entity46 , a coral reef ecologist and marine conservationist , filmed the shark on the small island of @entity26 and said his team were very excited at the discovery			0
he said local indigenous communities have been aware of the shark for many generations but it has only just been spotted by scientists @entity111 , director of the @entity112 of the @entity16 @entity113 , said : ' there is a growing awareness in our country of the important ecological role that sharks play in maintaining healthy fish stocks and especially in the tremendous economic potential of shark - focused marine tourism			1
' the shark is very distinctive with its leopard spot pattern together with the darker spots that collect under its ' chin '			0
@entity46 , who grew up in @entity129 , @entity130 , but has lived in @entity16 for 21 years , thinks this species will help in an important step by the government			0
he said : ' the local government of @entity26 is now very hopeful that this finding will further promote marine tourism to the area as a sustainable economic alternative to destructive fishing			2
' the discovery of the animal ( pictured ) coincides with a move by the @entity16 government to protect sharks and increase marine tourism and conservation			1

scientists found the newly discovered species off the coast of @entity16 although local indigenous *people* were already aware of its hunting habits
it 's named @entity18 after a group of close shark relatives and the place it was found - the eastern @entity25 island of @entity26
the find coincides with a move by the @entity16 government to protect sharks and increase marine tourism and conservation
