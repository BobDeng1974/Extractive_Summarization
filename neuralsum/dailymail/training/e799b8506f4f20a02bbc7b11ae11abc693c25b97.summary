find out how the other players got on with @entity20 's player ratings			0
@entity0 ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : @entity21 - 6.5 little chance to keep out @entity12 's strike but parried well from @entity25 chances and looked solid on return in goal			1
@entity0 keeper @entity21 applauds the home crowd after returning to the starting line - up at @entity5 @entity30 - 7 looked untroubled in unfamiliar defensive role , spraying superb attacking passes and playing very comfortably			1
@entity33 - 7 kept @entity25 quiet and led @entity0 's developing back three well			1
looked an attacking threat from set - pieces too			0
@entity0 defender @entity30 holds off the challenge of @entity37 during a comfortable performance @entity39 - 6.5 still does n't look good enough for an elite @entity41 side and was often poor in trying to clear defensive lines			2
@entity17 - 7.5 captained @entity0 in @entity44 's absence and did n't disappoint			1
controlled the midfield and set up opening goal			0
@entity0 left back @entity6 ( right ) celebrates his opener at @entity5 on monday evening @entity6 - 7 scored first @entity5 goal but was just as effective defensively as he was going forward			1
looks settled in 3 - 4 - 3 formation			1
@entity51 - 6.5 @entity52 seemed to pass midfielder by , but was alert defensively to prevent @entity2 from gaining an attacking influence on the wing			2
@entity57 went close with this effort on monday but could n't score in the 4 - 1 victory at @entity5 @entity60 - 7 the enforcer in the @entity0 midfield displayed a mature performance with a 90 per cent completion rate from 59 passes			1
@entity66 - 7.5 ( @entity67 90 ) full of invention and was a key attacking influence , with his back heel assist key in build up to @entity9 's second goal			2
@entity57 - 6.5 ( @entity75 83 ) a menace on the run , but night was spiked by poor finishing and a moment of madness to lash out at @entity81			0
lucky not to see red			0
@entity82 international @entity9 ( right ) fired in a brace to ensure @entity0 beat @entity2 at @entity5 @entity9 - 8 ( @entity84 77 ) fortunate , yet alert for first goal			1
but second strike was much more liking of a player costing Â£ 25million			0
@entity90 @entity84 - 6.5 given just 13 minutes and slotted well into a team which already had the game won			0
more to come though from the forward			0
@entity75 ( 83 ) @entity67 ( 90 ) @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity94 - 5 should have done better with opening goal and left embarrassed by @entity9 on second strike			1
@entity2 keeper @entity94 ( right ) gifted @entity9 @entity0 's second with a poor clearance @entity81 - 5.5 made seven interceptions , two clearances and battled well with @entity57			1
but also in a defence that conceded four goals			0
@entity104 - 5 bullied by @entity33 when defending corners and could n't prevent @entity0 's attackers from running riot			2
@entity108 - 4.5 ( @entity109 45 ) had so many problems dealing with @entity0 's attacks , he was hooked off at half - time for @entity109			2
@entity113 - 5.5 attempted to add width to @entity2 's left wing and often resourceful in possession			2
not as convincing in defence however			0
former @entity0 midfielder @entity118 ( centre ) headed into his own net during a disappointing evening @entity118 - 3.5 hard to imagine how @entity5 return could have got much worse			1
should have seen red for elbow on can and scored own goal			0
@entity12 - 6.5 could n't trouble the @entity0 defence with much of his attacking play but was well alert to pounce for @entity2 goal			1
@entity12 celebrates scoring immediately after @entity0 's second but it failed to ignite a comeback @entity132 - 5.5 on a night when @entity2 needed their speedy wingers to shine , the midfielder was literally caught with his shorts down			1
@entity136 - 5.5 struggled like @entity136 to carry @entity2 's main creative threat			2
had a header comfortably saved but offered little else			0
@entity139 - 5.5 ( @entity140 67 ) lost out in the midfield battle			0
passing as accurate as ever but could n't prevent @entity0 from controlling middle of the park			0
@entity2 striker @entity25 attempts to dispossess @entity0 defender @entity39 at @entity5 @entity25 - 6 ( @entity144 62 ) scored the most @entity41 goals of 2014 but only had a couple of half - chances at @entity5 to add to tally			1
@entity90 @entity144 - 6 got involved after replacing @entity25 , but could n't find the target despite going close on a few occasions - including hitting woodwork			0
@entity140 - 5 a replacement for @entity139 but offered no improvement as @entity0 took total control of the game following his introduction			2
@entity109 - 4.5 came on to help nullify @entity0 at the break and ended up being in a side which looked like conceding at will in the second half .			0

former @entity161 midfielder @entity9 scored a brace in 4 - 1 win
@entity118 , who used to play for @entity0 , endured a miserable game
the win pushes @entity0 level on points but above @entity2 in *eighth*
