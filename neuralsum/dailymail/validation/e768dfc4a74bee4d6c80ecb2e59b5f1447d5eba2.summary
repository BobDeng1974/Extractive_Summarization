@entity0 will use his @entity3 @entity2 stars to inflict yet more @entity5 misery on @entity6 – and says the @entity7 missed a trick in not taking @entity9 with him to @entity10			1
the @entity12 boss has already been on the receiving end of two defeats on @entity15			2
first , with @entity16 in 1997 , he was the victim of @entity18 ’s famous hat - trick in a 3 - 2 loss in the @entity21 group stages			1
ten years later he was back with @entity22 as they were beaten 4 - 2 in the last 16 of the @entity24 , turning the tie with a 2 - 0 victory back in @entity3			1
@entity27 returns with @entity12 on wednesday where he will come up against @entity9 and @entity29 , two of the players who helped @entity3 to the semi-finals of the @entity2 last summer			1
@entity0 described @entity9 ( left ) as an ' exceptional player ' ahead of @entity34 's match the @entity34 boss ( right ) was surprised @entity12 did n't make a move for the impressive full back and @entity0 said : ‘ @entity9 and @entity29 have been very helpful in terms of how @entity27 organises his teams			1
‘ they actually came to me with the advice , which was nice , and it was a helpful insight			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’ve heard his record here is n’t very good and he ’s lost twice , hopefully it will be third time unlucky			0
‘ i was there for that @entity16 game and i would n’t mind another night like that			2
’ meanwhile , @entity0 admits that @entity34 ’s £ 5million capture of @entity9 has proved one of the best pieces of business from last summer			1
@entity29 ( left ) and @entity9 have been giving @entity0 insight into how @entity27 sets his sides up the 25 - year - old was an ever - present in @entity57 and , with @entity12 short of options on the right side of defence , @entity0 is surprised @entity27 did not rival them for his signature			1
‘ i think @entity27 perhaps had more pressing issues to sort out because let 's not forget , when he came in he was talking about playing with three centre - backs , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but even as a wing - back @entity9 would have fitted into the system nicely			0
‘ he 's a top , top player			0
we lost a top player in @entity69 but replaced him with an exceptional player			1
‘ he 's been the most consistent player for us this season and is a great character			0
‘ he is a good defender and likes playing on the front foot and he gives you real quality going forward			0
the @entity7 goalkeeper played under @entity27 at the @entity2 including his heroics in a penalty shoot out ‘ that 's what we saw when we signed him			2
he 's second on the list of assists in the @entity86 for defenders and he ’s been excellent for us			0
’ there has been talk of @entity27 making a move for @entity9 at the end of the season			2
and the former @entity94 star certainly talks highly of his former international boss			1
‘ he is a fantastic trainer and he has had a magnificent career , ’ he said			0
‘ i have been very fortunate to work with him and i can not say a bad word about him			0
‘ he is one of the best trainers i have ever worked with , and if you see how he works tactically , it is great			0
he always seems to know what to do to win a game			0
’ @entity6 does n't have a good record at @entity5 and has lost his last two games there			2

@entity34 boss @entity0 says his @entity7 players have been helping him in his *preparation* for the game against @entity6
@entity0 also thinks @entity12 missed out on not signing @entity9 , who he describes as an ' exceptional player '
the 50 - year - old was at @entity5 when @entity27 was @entity16 boss and they were beaten 3 - 2 by @entity34 in the @entity21
@entity9 also spoke highly of his former international boss
