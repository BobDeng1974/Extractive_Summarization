this party was meant to be all about @entity1 coming home to @entity3 , but the guest of honour turned out to be the 28 - year - old son of a @entity8 cabbie			0
@entity1 responded to the earsplitting support from the people who love him the most by delivering a winning start for @entity12 against @entity13 in their @entity15 first - round knockout			1
but the @entity18 champion ’s four - set win over @entity19 turned out to be a mere warm - up act , as @entity22 's @entity21 screamed on @entity23 as he battled @entity24 to a standstill to put the home side 2 - 0 up with three rubbers to play			1
@entity23 dug out a sensational fightback against @entity24 on friday night @entity1 celebrates epic victory with team - mate ward @entity23 embraces @entity12 captain @entity31 after near five - hour thriller an emotional @entity23 finally clinched his sixth match point to sensationally beat the world no 20 6 - 7 , 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 , 15 - 13			1
he is transformed when in national colours			0
@entity1 seemed close to tears as he embraced him at the end of a career - best win that makes @entity40 firm favourites to reach the quarter finals			2
@entity23 so often saves his best for @entity15 , to the extent that it is fairly staggering to think that he has never cracked the world ’s top 100			1
‘ this is by far the best atmosphere i ’ve ever been part of in the @entity15 , ’ said @entity23			1
‘ i ’d prefer not to play five sets every time but the crowd was incredible and really helped			0
’ against the @entity13 in @entity52 13 months ago he put another tall man , @entity53 , to the sword with a comeback win to put @entity12 2 - 0 up			1
@entity24 , though , is a tougher proposition altogether			2
@entity13 no 1 @entity24 let slip a two - set lead against @entity23 in @entity22 @entity58 did little wrong in the first two sets , except for blowing the five points that followed him going 4 - 2 up in the opening tiebreak			1
one thing apparent in this match was how @entity12 have got the court surface right in making it relatively slow and low , and he fashioned his rebound by keeping the ball skidding and attacking the @entity13 ’s weaker backhand side			1
the 111 - minute deciding set became a tug of war in which neither man would yield			0
@entity24 is , after all , the player who once won an 11 hour five minute match over @entity74 at @entity75			2
@entity23 forced two match points at 5 - 4 , one at 10 - 9 and one at 11 - 10 , then needed to save two break points at 11 - 11 before breaking to love to clinch the match			1
@entity40 captain @entity31 said : ‘ it ’s really tough for the @entity13 now but they have @entity83 as captain and he will not let them go down without a fight			2
’ @entity1 and @entity87 roared on @entity23 to victory in five - set thriller the question now is whether @entity1 will put himself on the line in today ’s doubles with brother @entity87 for what would be a highly charged encounter with the world champion @entity95			2
after @entity23 ’s win he is surely much more likely to make way for @entity99 and save himself for tomorrow			2
@entity1 completed the first leg of his task when he took down @entity13 no 2 @entity19 6 - 1 , 6 - 1 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 in just under two hours			1
apart from an untimely dip at the end of the third set , @entity1 was in imperious form against world @entity107			0
by the time he had finished the warm - up the crowd had joined in a rousing singalong to @entity113 ’s @entity112 , and for @entity1 it was the perfect preparation			0
‘ i used that energy and emotion very well at the beginning of the match			0
i had a bit of a lull but i could n’t maintain the intensity i had in the first two sets			0
’ @entity1 compared the feel of the occasion to what he experienced at the @entity125 , and he responded in much the same way			0
it was certainly different to the lacklustre defeat by @entity130 teenager @entity129 in @entity131 last week			0
@entity1 was ever so slightly more pumped up yesterday			0
it might still come down to @entity23 in a fifth and deciding rubber , but after yesterday evening ’s heroics that that may not be necessary			0
@entity1 had put @entity12 1 - 0 up in tie by beating @entity19 6 - 1 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 2			1

@entity23 fought back from two sets down against @entity24
he dug out a sensational fightback to win 6 - 7 ( *4/7* ) 5 - 7 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( *7/3* ) 15 - 13
@entity12 lead 2 - 0 against @entity13 in @entity15 first - round clash
