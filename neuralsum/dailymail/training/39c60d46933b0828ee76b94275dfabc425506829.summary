but you would n't guess it			1
while most of his breed is healthy at 22 - 25 pounds , this seven - year - old @entity4 weighs a hefty 85			1
and when he was surrendered to animal rescue volunteers by his elderly @entity9 owner , they needed a wagon to wheel him into the shelter			1
' they used it to wheel him from his kennel to us , so we could take him out of the shelter			2
he had to be lifted out and helped to the car			2
' it was a shock - despite the fact that @entity4 , according to the @entity36 , ' are one of a very few breeds that will literally eat themselves to death			2
' @entity40 of the @entity36 explains that ' most dogs will self - regulate and only eat the amount of food they need to maintain the level of exercise they are getting			1
' however , beagles have a tendency to eat all the food they can get and use those soft brown eyes to beg for more and more			2
' but few have been known to gorge to such extremes			2
' his owner relinquished him to the shelter because they were elderly and unable to care for him , ' @entity54 told us			1
' we do n't know much beyond that , but we think it was a situation in which they were unable to walk him , and as time went on it got worse and worse			0
' hoping to tempt fate with a diet - friendly name , the volunteers came up with @entity1			1
video courtesy : one tail at a time special measures : his joints are so weak he had to be wheeled into the rescue center on a wagon he will now be placed on an intensive program to slim down			1
while exercise will be important , the volunteers will ease him into movement as he is so out of shape and his joints are weak			1
and on the menu , it wo n't be much more than kale chips			0
' we called him @entity1 to signify his new healthy life			1
we wanted to give him a fresh start with a new name			0
' i 'm sure he would have liked to be just chips , ' @entity54 said			0
the dog will remain at one tail at a @entity71 until he is adopted			0
' we are currently waiting for blood test results to see if he has any underlying medical issues			0
' if he does , we 'll take care of those first			0
if not , we teamed up with @entity100 who will be providing him with high quality , high protein , low calorie dog food			0
' we are also working with @entity106 and will be starting him on a slow weight loss program which will include hydrotherapy ( underwater treadmill )			0
it 's going to be a slow , steady process			0
