click here for more from our brilliant @entity1 , including this map of @entity5 's stunning goal for @entity6			1
this , even @entity7 would have to concede , was not a game for sitting on a barstool			1
it was a game that had you on your feet			0
that had you wondering if the @entity15 that keeps on giving really can get any better			0
the finest players on the planet will certainly do well here in @entity19 to better @entity5 ’s 21st minute strike ; an equaliser that goes straight into the greatest volleys in history file alongside men like @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
it was @entity6 ’s 10th @entity15 goal and a perfect one at that			1
but it was more than just the quality of the goals			0
it was the sheer , unexpected drama of the encounter			0
the courage and determination of an @entity40 team , the lowest ranked side in the competition , that dared to dream and dared even to lead the beaten finalists of 2010 and most recent conquerors of @entity45			2
having beaten @entity45 5 - 1 , they clearly thought this was going to be easy			1
@entity107 might have opened the scoring but after little more than a minute @entity5 had levelled in spectacular style , and deservedly so			1
@entity6 had been the better team against their apathetic opponents , maintaining that momentum to the break			2
for @entity128 it was proving most uncomfortable			0
more even than he imagined when he complained that a restricted view meant he might have to stand , or perhaps bring a barstool , to see from the sunken dug - outs			2
it seemed he did get the television cameraman moved , having also moaned about that			0
but the @entity40 were giving him a much bigger problem , so much so that @entity128 abandoned the 3 - 5 - 2 formation he had employed for this tournament and switched to a back four			1
in fairness to @entity140 ’s next manager , he had said a back four might work better against these opponents			0
deadly : @entity47 winger @entity107 ( right ) drives the ball into the bottom corner to give his side the lead nothing but net : @entity107 's powerful effort eludes @entity6 goalkeeper @entity55 helpless : @entity55 watches on as @entity107 's shot nestles into the bottom corner after 20 minutes on fire : @entity107 celebrates scoring his third goal of the competition in only his second game @entity47 's @entity104 saw plenty of the ball on the left side of midfield in his side 's 3 - 2 win against @entity6 - click here for more in our @entity1 @entity104 heat map vs @entity6 it proved a smart move , even if his side first had to overcome an @entity6 penalty before @entity28 struck an equaliser and @entity51 produced a slightly fortuitous winner			1
after that thumping victory against @entity45 @entity128 stuck with the same side , no doubt in the hope of being able to rest players in their final group game			0
@entity6 made just two changes , bringing in @entity46 and @entity86			2
but they employed the same determined approach they demonstrated against @entity181			0
even though they lost that game , their effort could not be faulted			0
indeed here they actually displayed more energy than the @entity118 in the opening exchanges			0
@entity128 ’s side were a little sluggish and disjointed			0
perhaps even a touch complacent			0
but a goal for the @entity118 nevertheless came , and far too easily for @entity6 ’s liking			2
it was classic @entity107 , from the manner in which he escaped the clutches of @entity83 to the way he then accelerated away before driving a low , left - foot shot past @entity55			1
but it was the failure to close him down , in particular by @entity84 , that would have disappointed @entity200			0
on the spot : @entity94 scores from the penalty spot to put @entity6 in front on 54 minutes perfect penalty : @entity94 's spot - kick is fired into the bottom corner of the @entity47 goal all smiles : @entity94 celebrates his goal as his @entity6 team - mates run to join him at the @entity211 of course , @entity6 ’s coach was on his feet only 69 seconds later , courtesy of @entity5 ’s quite staggering finish			1
it was brilliant , spectacular ; the fashion in which he connected with @entity46 ’s long diagonal ball just fantastic ; a left - foot volley , his weaker foot , crashing home off the underside of the crossbar			2
a further opportunity would fall to @entity107 but to @entity88 an even better chance would come			2
he had the goal at his mercy but just when it seemed he would send @entity6 into a most unexpected lead , he blasted his effort over the bar			1
if @entity128 ’s view was less restricted , he would not have been happy with what he was seeing			0
even less so when @entity5 caught @entity235 with a foolishly late challenge			2
particularly foolish given it earned the former @entity238 midfielder a yellow card that rules him out of the final group game against @entity45			0
it also marked the end if @entity98 ’s afternoon			0
he left the field on a stretcher , with @entity57 coming on to replace him			2
lining it up : @entity47 striker @entity28 ( centre ) prepares to strike the ball at goal rocket : @entity105 smashes a powerful strike into the roof of @entity6 's net to make it 2 - 2 jumping for joy : @entity140 striker @entity105 leaps into the air to celebrate his goal the half - time statistics said it all , though			1
@entity6 had enjoyed 51 per cent of the ball and they had managed five shots to @entity47 ’s four			1
@entity128 needed to make a change and he did , switching to that back four formation			0
no sooner had the second half started than @entity105 had also collected a booking – for a naughty lash out at @entity84 - that excludes him from the next game			0
so that was both centre - forwards in the book			0
but @entity128 ’s mood would darken further still , with the sight of @entity94 scoring the 54th minute penalty that put @entity6 ahead			1
the penalty , while it clearly struck @entity277 ’s hands , was harsh given the arm was down and @entity89 ’s cross was struck from close - range			1
but @entity281 pointed immediately to the spot and the @entity6 captain converted with ease			1
under pressure : @entity6 's @entity90 ( right ) attempts a pass as @entity28 ( left ) closes him down going down : @entity6 midfielder @entity88 falls on top of @entity47 's @entity288 during the first half heads up : @entity105 wins a header as players from both sides tussle inside the @entity6 box yellow : @entity5 is booked after clashing with @entity47 defender @entity235 ( right ) game over : @entity98 is placed on a stretcher and taken off the pitch after being injured four minutes later and the @entity118 would draw level , @entity105 turning brilliantly on a neat pass from @entity51 before slotting his shot beyond the reach of @entity55			1
but @entity105 was flirting dangerously with controversy too , a clattering challenge on @entity94 serious enough for the @entity304 referee to at least consider a second yellow for the @entity47 skipper			1
in the end , the @entity118 just proved too strong , too technical good , for the courageous @entity40 , even if @entity86 perhaps should have scored prior to @entity57 ’s 68th minute winner ; a 30 - yard shot that @entity55 , on reflection , is sure to feel he should have saved .			1

substitute @entity57 completed @entity47 's comeback after @entity6 had led 2 - 1
@entity94 gave @entity6 the lead from the penalty spot after @entity5 's stunning volley had cancelled out @entity107 's opener
@entity28 struck to make it 2 - 2 in @entity116
@entity7 's @entity47 are now on the brink of the last 16
