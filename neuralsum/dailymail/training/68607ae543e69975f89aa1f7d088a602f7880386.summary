by @entity0 published : 15:38 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 01:36 est , 21 may 2013 despite expectations that he will serve half of his 17 - year jail term , @entity1 has asked the @entity5 to shorten his sentence @entity1 has asked for his 17 - year prison sentence for his role in killing @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , and @entity14 , to be reduced			1
the announcement comes one day after @entity1 's legal team appealed to the @entity17 to cut her 17 - year jail term			1
@entity1 , 32 her husband @entity19 , 56 and their friend @entity1 , 46 were all convicted of manslaughter last month			2
they started a house fire in @entity25 , which claimed the lives of the six children who were sleeping upstairs			1
it is believed that @entity1 , who was given a life sentence , is also considering an appeal			1
barrister @entity31 , who spoke for @entity1 during the seven - week trial , today said : ' we have lodged an application with the @entity17 for leave to appeal the length of the sentence			1
' @entity1 's appeal against her jail sentence has been criticised by her father @entity40 , who said he was ' disappointed ' by the news			1
he said : ' appealing like this will just drag everything back up and cause a lot of upset to the family			0
' it will cost tax payers a lot of money to get it through the appeal court , there will be a lot of bad feeling and i do n't think she will succeed			0
i 'm disappointed by it			0
she should just get on with her sentence			0
' i do n't think it was too long , she should have got as long as @entity19 for what she did			0
' six little children lost their lives and nothing will change that			0
' mrs @entity1 's barrister , @entity65 said : ' the reaction to the sentence is we think it was too long , and so we are going to see whether or not we can persuade the @entity17 to reduce the sentence			1
@entity1 ( left ) was jailed for 17 years for killing her six children but says her sentence is ' too long ' @entity1 ( pictured with husband @entity19 ) was told that she ignored ' obvious ' risks to her children 's safety and is said to have been in a ' horrendous relationship ' with her husband ' @entity1 was instrumental in killing six children but we feel her role in the killing of the six children was not as substantial as the trial judge has assessed so we will have to wait and see what the @entity17 says			1
' @entity83 , 10 , and her brothers @entity10 , 13 , @entity11 , nine , @entity12 , eight , @entity13 , six and @entity14 , five , died from the effects of smoke inhalation following the blaze on may 11 last year			0
their parents , along with @entity1 , all denied starting the fire , which the prosecution said was ' a plan that went tragically wrong ' - aimed at framing @entity1 's former live - in mistress @entity93			2
but following a trial at @entity96 , a jury found the trio guilty of six counts of manslaughter			2
@entity1 's father ( pictured left with daughter @entity101 , and right , outside court ) said he is disappointed in his daughter 's appeal the cramped three - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity25 was shared by @entity1 , his wife , mistress and all 11 children he had with both women the six children perished when the fire tore through their home ( above ) in @entity25 , last may a spokeswoman for @entity115 police said the force would not comment			1
' any appeal against the sentence is a matter for the courts			2
it would be inappropriate for the police to comment on the reports , ' she said			0
earlier this month , @entity40 completed a 100 - mile walk from @entity125 to @entity25 to raise money for @entity130 , a @entity25 organisation that helps families of sick children			0
mr @entity40 was one of 12 walkers who finished the walk on saturday may 11 - exactly one year after the fire			2
it culminated in a fun day held at @entity134 in @entity25 , which began with the releasing of six white doves into the air .			0
