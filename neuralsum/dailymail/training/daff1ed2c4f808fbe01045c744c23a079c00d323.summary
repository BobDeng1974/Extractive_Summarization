they 're sisters , they ’re all four years old – but , remarkably , these three little girls are not triplets			1
the eldest , @entity4 , was just nine months old when she became a big sister to twins @entity6 and @entity8			1
her mother , @entity9 , 40 , had become pregnant again within 12 weeks of her birth , and the twins were born prematurely at 28 weeks			1
@entity12 's company : big sister @entity4 , centre , is only nine months older than her sisters , twins @entity6 , left and @entity8 it means for three months of each year , the sisters are all the same age			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ people ca n’t believe it when i tell them all the girls are the same age , yet they are n’t triplets			1
‘ i ca n’t quite believe i ’ve given birth to three girls in just nine months			1
i ’ve certainly had my hands full			2
’ mrs @entity9 , a teacher , and her hairdresser husband @entity27 , 39 , had their first daughter @entity4 in july 2008			2
they started trying for another baby three months later			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ we had wanted to have babies close together so we thought when @entity4 was three months old that we should start trying as we did n’t know how long it would take			1
happy surprise : @entity9 and @entity36 began trying for another baby three months after @entity4 was born , but did not count on falling pregnant on the first try ‘ if it was going to take a year or so to fall pregnant , then we wanted to start trying straight away			1
i actually fell pregnant the first time we started trying , which was a bit of a surprise			2
’ the couple , who live in @entity44 , @entity45 , were in for a further surprise when mrs @entity9 went for a 12 - week scan and the sonographer told her she was expecting twins			2
she said : ‘ i could n’t believe what i was hearing			2
i was in complete shock			2
i ’d had a lot more morning sickness with this pregnancy , but i had never imagined that i could be carrying twins			2
there are no twins in either side of our families			2
‘ i was actually offered counselling by the hospital after i ’d found out			2
i think they thought that three babies in under nine months was a bit too much to cope with			1
‘ we discussed it and decided that it was daunting , but as long as we were organised , then we would be able to manage			0
’ same , same , but different : the three @entity9 sisters have a very close bond , ' acting like triplets ' and all sleeping in one bed but in april 2009 , when mrs @entity9 was 27 weeks pregnant , she went into premature labour			1
she said : ‘ it was so frightening that the babies were on their way at such an early stage			0
we did n’t even know if they would survive			0
we really thought that we were going to lose them			0
’ proud parents : @entity9 and @entity36 doctors at @entity79 managed to hold off the contractions for a week			0
then the twins were delivered , each weighing only 2lbs			0
the girls were transferred to @entity84 in @entity45			0
@entity8 suffered two bleeds on the brain , had a hole in her heart and had a collapsed lung			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ it was a terrifying time for us when the twins were first born			1
they were so tiny and so poorly			0
at one point we said goodbye to @entity8 , but amazingly she managed to fight on			1
’ @entity8 was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and the doctors warned mrs @entity9 that she may never walk			1
but she has proved the medics wrong , something that mrs @entity9 believes is down to her close relationship with her sisters			0
she said : ‘ they have such a strong bond			0
@entity4 was only nine months old when the twins were born , so she has never known life without them there			1
‘ it is as if they are all triplets			0
they are never apart from each other			0
she has just as strong a bond with the twins as they do with each other			0
they always want to sleep all together on one bed			0
’ ‘ @entity8 has been helped so much by her sisters			1
it has given her the goal and incentives to keep up with them , which has helped her enormously			0
’ she added : ‘ it may have been a shock to give birth to three babies in nine months , but i would n’t change it for the world			1
’ mrs @entity9 is fundraising for @entity122			0
she has just completed the @entity123 to raise funds			0
