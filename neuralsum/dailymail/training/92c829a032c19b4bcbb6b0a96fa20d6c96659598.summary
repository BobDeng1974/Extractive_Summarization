arriving in his typical smooth style , the film star was pictured apparently at the helm of the boat , wearing sunglasses and a tee - shirt advertising his own brand of tequila			2
people have turned a blind eye to the alleged illegal driving of the water - taxi - all bar one			0
under investigation : @entity3 is being investigated for allegedly driving a @entity2 water taxi without a permit authorities said checks will be made to establish of @entity3 was in command of the taxi as he attended the city 's films festival @entity2 lawyer @entity32 has reported the incident to authorities demanding that police take action against the star , according to @entity37			1

photos of the film star in @entity2 , with co-stars of his latest film ' gravity ' , appear to show @entity3 stood at the front of a gondola , behind the wheel , more than once			1
on one occasion he is wearing a grey tee - shirt with the logo of his own tequila on the front ; in another he is wearing pale blue shirt with an open collar and a dark blue blazer			0
the claim that he drove without a permit comes as the city deals with criticisms that its waterways are chaotic and dangerous			0
if found to have been driving the taxi , the film star would be committing an administrative offence , in which case his taxi driver would be issued with a fine , an official said earlier this month , a @entity73 tourist was crushed and killed when the gondola he was travelling in collided with a vaporetto water taxi			1

exceptions for film stars were not mentioned in the new laws , however , so authorities are now looking into the claims that @entity3 was at the helm without a permit			1
