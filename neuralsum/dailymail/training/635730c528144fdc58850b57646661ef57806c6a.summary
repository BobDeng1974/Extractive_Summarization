world markets were hit by another bout of global economic growth fears today with @entity4 shares falling 2.8 per cent as the copper price was hammered			1
the euro also fell below its 1999 launch value versus the dollar for the first time in nine years , and to six - year lows against the pound			1
the single currency was hit by growing expectations that the @entity14 will announce a government bond - buying programme to jumpstart the eurozone economy out of deflation			1
but wider market jitters were caused by the @entity20 slashing its overall growth forecast for 2015 from 3.4 per cent to 3 per cent , citing stagnation in @entity23 and in @entity24			1
both the @entity25 ( above ) and the @entity26 ( below ) have fallen today due to a fall in copper prices the bank also highlighted a slowdown in @entity32 's expansion and estimated growth for 2014 at 2.6 per cent , well below earlier expectations of 2.8 per cent			1
that hammered copper , a leading barometer of industrial demand , whose global price fell 6 per cent - its biggest drop in nine years mirroring the continuing slump in the world oil price , which has more than halved in six months , also on global growth concerns			1
in turn that hit heavyweight commodity and mining shares in @entity4 , sending the @entity25 plunging 180 points to 6,362.2			1
leading shares on @entity50 meanwhile opened 1.2 per cent down , and the @entity52 and @entity53 blue - chip indices were down by a similar amount			0
the euro fell 0.4 per cent to $ 1.1728 , its lowest level in nine years and below $ 1.1747 , the level it started trading at in @entity59 on january 4 1999			0
the euro also hit a new six - year lows against sterling at 77.40p , making a pound worth € 1.295			1
the fresh falls by the single currency came as an adviser to @entity23 's top court said that an earlier , unused , @entity14 bond - buying programme proposed in 2012 was pretty much legal			1
@entity69 , advocate general at the court , said while the @entity14 was entitled to buy bonds and that the @entity73 scheme outlined was ' necessary ' and ' proportionate ' , it would first have to spell out its justification and remove itself from any direct aid programme to a eurozone member state			2
that ruling was seen as leaving the door open for the central bank to embark on outright money - printing for the first time after its next policy meeting on january 22			2
@entity83 at @entity84 said : ' there is nothing in this ruling that blocks @entity88			0
' although the advocate general 's opinion looked at a bond - buying blueprint from 2012 , designed at the height of the financial crisis to avert a break - up of the euro , it could shape future quantitative easing moves by the @entity14 in order to combat deflation in the eurozone			1
@entity101 at @entity102 said : ' the reason why this ruling was so important was because of the implications it could have had for @entity88 , which the @entity14 is expected to announce next week			0
' the euro has fallen sharply against the dollar over the last month and is now below its 1999 launch level stimulus expected : @entity14 boss @entity111 is expected to unveil a government bond - buying programme after next week 's policy meeting for the eurozone 's central bank			2
he added : ' had the @entity118 ruled against @entity119 , @entity117 would have come up against significant opposition as the two programs are very similar			0
both involve purchasing government bonds on the secondary market , which some have argued constitutes government funding			0
' with this hurdle now out of the way , @entity117 is free to announce a bond buying program without fearing a backlash from those that previously called it illegal and outside of his remit			0
' the opinion is another milestone in a long - running dispute between the @entity14 and @entity53 , the largest member of the 19 - country bloc about the merits of printing money to aid the struggling eurozone economy			1
the @entity145 had referred the @entity73 legality question to @entity23 's top court			0
oil prices that have fallen by about 60 percent since june are wreaking havoc on economies that depend on commodities exports			0
@entity153 finance minister @entity152 called for a 10 percent spending cut on everything but defence on wednesday			0
at the same time , @entity23 is on shaky ground despite the @entity14 's bond - buying stimulus plan			2
' the global economy is running on a single engine ... the @entity160 one , ' the @entity20 's chief economist , @entity159 , said			1
' this does not make for a rosy outlook for the world			0
' analysts said oil prices would remain weak as a result of oversupply , prompting cuts to price forecasts for 2015 and 2016			0
growth for this year is expected to be better than last year partly due to the economic benefits of low oil prices and the strengthening @entity160 economy as well as low interest rates , though the pace will be lower than had been thought			1
@entity178 bashed : copper prices saw their biggest drop in nine years , following on from sharp falls in oil prices , as the @entity20 slashed global growth forecasts raising worries about demand or commodities the eurozone is expected to grow by just 1.1 per cent this year , down from a forecast in june that it would expand by 1.8 per cent , according to the @entity20 's @entity190 report			1
the report expects the @entity192 to grow by 2.9 per cent this year , above the average for high income countries of 2.2 per cent but behind the @entity160 at 3.2 per cent			2
@entity32 is expected to grow by 7.1 per cent this year , a slowdown from 7.4 per cent in 2014 , according to the @entity20			2
@entity197 crude was lower again today at around $ 46 a barrel compared to $ 114 in june			0
@entity4 - listed mining and commodities firms were hammered by the plunge in metal prices , with @entity203 shedding £ 3billion of its value and @entity205 losing more than £ 1billion of its worth as both plunged by 9 per cent			0
meanwhile , @entity206 fell 8 per cent and @entity207 was down 6 per cent			0
the falls by less commodity - focused @entity23 markets were less pronounced , however , with @entity53 's @entity212 index and @entity52 's cac 40 index both down around 0.3 per cent , helped by the enhanced @entity14 bond - buying hopes .			2
