by @entity0 a set of mastodon tucks and a stone - age tool dredged together out of the @entity4 by fishermen suggest that human could have settled in @entity7 thousands of years before previously thought , according to a controversial new study			1
the mastodon remains are 22,000 years old , according to radio - carbon dating - up to ten thousand years older than the @entity12 culture , thought to be the first settlers in the @entity14			1
most researchers believe the first humans inhabited @entity7 between 13,000 and 16,500 years ago after crossing the @entity18 land bridge from @entity19			2
this flint tool , which was found with a 22,000 - year - old mastodon skull in the bottom of the @entity4			1
it could be proof that humans inhabited @entity7 up to ten thousands years before previously thought the mastodon tusk that was hacked off a skull found in the @entity4 was carbon - dated to 22,000 years old despite the incredible claims , much of the archaeological community remains skeptical , @entity27 reports			1
' the bottom line is , there simply is no context for these discoveries , ' @entity32 - @entity31 archaeologist @entity30 told the site			0
he added : ' there 's absolutely no dna evidence			0
' just because the two items were found together , he argues , does n't meant that they were from the same time frame			0
there is no way to prove the flint tool is as old as the mastodon skull , dr @entity30 said			1
the incredible archaeological find was discovered in 230 feet of water 60 miles off shore in 1974			0
fishermen who were dragging their scalloping nets across the bottom of the bay snagged a massive mastodon skull and dragged it to the surface			2
also in the net was a flint knife			2
the skull of the giant ice - age beast was too big to carry back to shore , so the crew cut off the tusks and teeth and threw the rest back in the water			0
the captain of the boat donated his artifacts to the local @entity71 's @entity70 in @entity72 , where the sat unnoticed for near 40 decades			0
these are the teeth hacked from the mastodon skull in 1974			1
they suggest the beast was less than 30 years old when it died they were re-discovered by a @entity79 geologist , who alerted @entity80 , an archaeologist at the @entity81			0
dr @entity80 believes that the tool shows wear - proof , he says , that it was used before it was submerged in water			0
the @entity4 has been underwater since the last ice age ended 14,000 years ago - meaning the tool is at least 14,000 years old			2
dr @entity80 , however , believes it was used to butcher the mastodon , which would make it 22,000 years old , according to @entity27 .			1

a flint knife was found with a mastodon skull in the @entity4 in 1974
the skull is 22,000 years old and could prove that humans were in @entity7 up to ten thousand years before previously thought
