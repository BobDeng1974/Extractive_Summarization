@entity5 , 55 , had to put on a brave face as she worked as an unpaid intern for a public relations firm in @entity9 earlier this year			1
the former media relations manager has been building contact lists and fetching lunches as she tries to boost chances of full employment again			1
trying everything : @entity5 , 55 , had to put on a brave face as she worked as an intern for a public relations firm in @entity9 ms @entity5 is one of many older @entity2 struggling to find jobs and keep their skills up to date in the worst labour market in decades			1
internships were once the domain of high school and college students - but older workers are trying to build up their resume in between jobs			1
‘ you have to suck it up sometimes and do what a 17 - year - old would happily do and be happy about it , ’ ms @entity5 said			2
@entity34 , founder of online job search advice website @entity35 , said lots of adults laid off are looking for new ways to improve their cv			0
she said : ‘ the last thing you want to do is look the interviewer in the eye with a blank stare when they ask you : “ what have you been doing for the last year ? ” ’ careers advisor @entity46 said she had never been approached by mid-career clients seeking help securing an internship before 2008			2
‘ there has definitely been almost an explosion of this kind of thing , ’ she explained			0
‘ in 2008 , i had about 20 of them			0
’ that increased to 36 annually in 2009 and 2010 , ms @entity46 said			0
ms @entity46 says @entity58 's 2006 movie ‘ @entity59 ’ may have contributed to the uptick in post-college - age interns			1
film link : 2006 movie ' @entity59 ' with @entity58 and @entity64 may have contributed to the uptick in post-college - age interns in the film , mr @entity58 's character loses everything in a get - rich - quick scheme selling bone density scanners			1
but in a @entity70 twist , he lands a stock brokerage internship , which , after six gruelling months , turns into a job			0
@entity73 , who analyses initial employment at @entity75 , said the number of graduates taking internships ‘ ballooned last year ’			2
but it did ease off as the labour market improved earlier this year			0
chatting : ms @entity5 , left , talks with a colleague at @entity82 in @entity9 , where she was media relations director for more than 16 years college internships did not take off until the 1970s , when baby boomers flooded universities			1
from 1970 to 1983 , the number of colleges and universities offering internship programs increased from 200 to 1,000			0
‘ if i could get someone like me for free , i would be apologetic about it , but i would do it ' @entity5 the rising number of older interns now represents a broader crisis in the labour market in which job seekers can not get the kind of work they want			1
while the unemployment rate ticked up to 9.1 per cent in may , almost 16 per cent of @entity2 were ‘ underemployed ’ in the same month			2
this means they were either out of work but looking , working part - time involuntarily or discouraged from searching for a job			2
@entity108 data this week showed initial claims for unemployment benefits have dipped by just 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 428,000			0
presentation : ms @entity5 , left , is now a part - time consultant at the museum and had to work as an unpaid intern earlier this year during her job search that is far from the drop below 400,000 claims that would signal an improvement in the labour market			1
' the last thing you want to do is look the interviewer in the eye with a blank stare when they ask you : “ what have you been doing for the last year ? ” ' @entity34 , online job search advice website @entity35 ms @entity5 , now back doing freelance consulting for the same museum that laid her off , is grateful for her internship , which ended in may			2
she understands the business logic of using older workers as interns and learned about social media without having to pay the cost of education			1
‘ if i could get someone like me for free , i would be apologetic about it , but i would do it			0
’ but she says there is nothing easy about starting over at 55 and it was difficult when she made early errors during her internship			0
‘ it was very stressful , ’ she said			0
‘ even though they were n't paying me , i felt badly i could n't do it well			0

@entity5 learned about social media at a public relations firm instead of paying for education
one of millions of @entity2 struggling to find jobs and filling spare time with unpaid internships
careers expert *believes* more older interns may be down to @entity58 's film ' @entity59 '
