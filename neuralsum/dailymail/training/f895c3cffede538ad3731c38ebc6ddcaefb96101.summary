legend : @entity1 was once dubbed ' the most beautiful woman in the world ' @entity5 screen siren @entity1 has won a bitter legal tussle with her son over her vast fortune			1
only son and heir @entity9 had wanted to wrest control of her estimated £ 30 million estate from the 87 - year - old actress , claiming she had fallen under the sway of several young male admirers			1
last year the screen goddess once dubbed ' @entity17 in the @entity18 ' took legal action against her former toyboy lover over claims he married her by proxy without her knowledge to get his hands on her money			2
mr @entity9 had asked for her estate , including properties in @entity30 and @entity31 , to be managed by a court - appointed administrator			1
he told @entity30 newspaper @entity34 earlier this year : ‘ my mother needs an administrator - i fear she may no longer be capable of handling her affairs by herself			1
’ the lifestyle of his mother recently seen in the company of a ' very young manager , ' had given mr @entity9 reason for concern , the newspaper reported			0
however on wednesday a judge in @entity45 rejected the request , ruling that the octogenarian diva was perfectly capable of managing her own finances			0
according to a statement put out by the @entity52 star 's agent , @entity50 , the judge 's ruling ' found that ms @entity1 had no need of an administrator as she is , from a mental point of view , autonomous , coherent and lucid , in the light of an excellent interview with her			1
' the prosecutor was of the same opinion that there was no substance to any supposition to the contrary			0
' she added : ' @entity1 is left with the profound bitterness of a mother having to face and fight this deeply sad occurrence			1
' ' she always had faith in the understanding and reasoning of the judges and today that faith has been rewarded			0
' sham wedding ? @entity1 pictured with @entity78 @entity77 , who she claimed married an imposter version of her her lawyers , @entity83 e @entity81 , said they were satisfied and had maintained from the beginning ' the absence of any element that justified any such request '			1
the case has additionally damaged the image of ms @entity1 because of the pre-emptive media coverage , they said			2
the actress , known for her rivalry with fellow @entity30 @entity93 , made headlines the world over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in @entity99 in 2010			1
ms @entity1 first met @entity99 businessman @entity77 , 43 years her junior , at a party in @entity31 in the 1980s			1
the couple became companions and planned to marry in 2006 but miss @entity1 changed her mind before the ceremony could take place			2
sour : the pair were engaged in 2006 , but @entity108 backed out at the last minute declaring he could not handle the media spotlight flying visit : @entity1 pictured with her former husband @entity111 at @entity112 the former sex symbol , who acted with @entity115 and @entity116 , said she had no knowledge of her 2010 wedding to mr @entity77 and would never have agreed to it			2
she only discovered it by chance on the internet with the help of her young male manager , @entity124			0
she told the @entity125 last year : ' i knew nothing about this until i did some research on the internet			0
he invented a false document to carry out this wedding and now he will pay			0
' i will not rest until he has been brought to justice			0
he is nothing but a vulture , circling me , sniffing my blood			0
he married me and was waiting for me to die so he could inherit my possessions			0
' but @entity77 claimed the marriage was ‘ completely legitimate , ’ and witnessed by eight people .			2
