by @entity0 an 18 - year - old @entity2 girl has won her bid to have a $ 680,000 - a - year drug subsidised so that she can receive ongoing medical treatments to keep her alive			1
@entity6 , who spent her recent 18th birthday wishing to stay alive , will finally have access to her first government - funded dose of @entity11 , which will save her family more than $ 24,000 a fortnight and help her fight a very rare immune disease which attacks her internal organs			1
ms @entity6 is suffering the life - threatening blood disease called atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome , or @entity18 which can result in blood clots and can destroy internal organs			1
@entity6 has had 11 doses of @entity11 since february , costing her family about $ 250,000 , but now she will be given the drug for less after a joint @entity24 and federal government - funding agreement was reached			1
so far she is the only @entity34 with access to the subsidised drug but it is hoped her case will open the debate up further for @entity11 to be accessible to everyone			1
it is a short - term solution , her mother @entity42 said , but one that she hopes receives long - term funding			2
“ we have won but we have n’t secured @entity6 absolutely to access this medicine long - term , ” ms @entity42 told @entity48			1
@entity6 's mother , who had given up her job running her own mentoring and business consultancy company to care for her daughter , thanked senator @entity55 and @entity2 mp @entity56 who told her on tuesday that @entity6 would get the treatment			1
she had been spending all of the family 's money , as well as money borrowed from friends , on the life - saving treatment			1
she was forced to stop the treatment on june 5 , given the ongoing financial demands			0
she said the government intervention in helping @entity6 prolong her life is a big bonus - given @entity11 ' is the only treatment ' which helps manage her condition			1
' without a doubt @entity11 is the most expensive drug in the world , ' said ms @entity42			2
' it is the only treatment in the whole world for @entity18			2
' @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity18 , which can strike at any age , when she was seven months old			2
she then found out then that her uncle had died of the disease as a child			0
unusually , the illness lay dormant in @entity6 before resurfacing late last year , just a few weeks after she finished high school			2
@entity6 's mother @entity42 ( left ) discovered a drug that could treat @entity18 , called @entity11 , which costs $ 24,000 per fortnightly dose @entity6 was first diagnosed with the life - threatening illness when she was seven months old ( pictured here after her initial diagnosis ) so far ms @entity42 has been able to pay for five courses of the treatment , with help from her family and from donations @entity11 is currently available at a subsidised rate for people suffering with another ultra-rare disease , called paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria ( @entity96 ) through the @entity97 ( @entity97 )			1
it was being considered by the @entity97 as a treatment for @entity18 when the @entity97 was put under review by the federal government earlier this year			2
the drug was then moved for consideration to the @entity104 ( @entity104 )			0
the @entity104 recommended that @entity11 be subsidised under the @entity105 for sufferers of @entity18 , though there are still several bureaucratic steps to go through before any subsidy will come into effect			1
@entity111 , a representative of the @entity112 said that the @entity104 recommendation leaves many questions unanswered			0
of particular concern , she says , is that under the proposed conditions , patients will only be eligible for the drug is they are currently experiencing a flare - up of the condition , and will only be allowed to take the drug for six months after they have recovered from the attack , even though it is recommended that sufferers remain on the drug for the duration of their lives			2
' sufferers want to know who will qualify for @entity11 , whether they 'll be able to stay on it long - term , there are so many question marks , ' she said			1
' the tragedy is there 's a drug that 's available , that works , and it sits on pharmacy shelves , the doctors want to be able to prescribe it but they ca n't			0
' a spokesperson for the @entity139 confirmed that it was currently in negotiations with @entity142 , who hold the patent for the drug			0
@entity142 were contacted for comment			0
' @entity147 noticed symptoms and she took me to hospital and they told me the @entity18 had come back			0
since then i was faced with this terrible battle , ' she said			0
' i could n't keep any food down , i was always vomiting , i could n't stand up , i 'd feel very dizzy , i had fevers … sadly i have chronic kidney failure now			0
' she required an endless run of hospital visits – with @entity6 requiring eight - hour stretches of dialysis three to four days a week , as well as plasma infusions – before ms @entity42 heard of @entity11			1
' thank @entity161 for @entity162 ! ' she said			0
ms @entity42 was able to fund five doses of the drug , with the help of her family and friends , and two further doses were bought using donations , including a $ 19,000 donation from @entity6 's school and an anonymous $ 10,000 donation			1
' i am so grateful for that , ' said @entity6			0
' i thank everyone for that			0
' since starting on @entity11 on @entity176 , @entity6 has turned a corner			2
she still requires dialysis , but the plasma infusions , which she describes as ' weird ' and ' scary ' have stopped , her hours in hospital have significantly decreased and she is feeling much better			0
her blood tests are also showing vastly improved results , with the nephrologist telling @entity6 on monday that if her results continue in the direction they 're going she might be able to come off dialysis			0
but with the cost of @entity11 currently so high , it was cost $ 680,000 a year to keep her on the drug , @entity6 and her mother do not have the money to buy their next dose , which @entity6 is due to take on thursday june 19			1
without @entity11 , @entity6 will likely deteriorate , and if left too long , the damage to her kidney will be so severe that she will have to remain on dialysis for the rest of her life			1
' she 's 17 , can you imagine a lifetime of chronic kidney failure ? and when i say a lifetime , it 's not going to be a long life , ' said ms @entity42			2
ms @entity42 is frustrated at @entity207 , the @entity208 company that produce @entity11 and own the patent for the drug			0
' on the one hand $ 680,000 a year to save your child 's life is a big price , it 's too high , ' she said			1
however , most of her anger is directed at the @entity34 government , which she says is ' a system that we thought was there to protect and look after us [ and ] has in a way let us down '			0
' it baffles me how could you justify fuelling aeroplanes to go and look for an aeroplane that ’s who knows where			0
but when someone needs mediciine , and it is the only medicine that is available , you sit there and negotiate and it might take six months , ' she said			0

@entity6 ( pictured right going to her school formal just before the @entity18 resurfaced ) is @entity42 's only child the 18 - year - old is trying to stay positive despite her chronic condition @entity11 costs $ 24,00 for each dose of the drug			1

@entity6 will receive subsidised life - saving drug treatment
she suffers from a rare immune condition called @entity18
@entity11 treats the condition but at full price costs $ 24,000 a fortnight
the 18 - year - old 's mother spent up to $ 250,000 treating her daughter
her case has opened up debate to subsidise the drug long term
