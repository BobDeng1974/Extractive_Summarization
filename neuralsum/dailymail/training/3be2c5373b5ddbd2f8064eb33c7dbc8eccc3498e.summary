more than 150,000 people have signed petitions to block a @entity3 hunter from importing and killing an endangered black rhinoceros			1
@entity5 bid $ 350,000 at an auction last january for the ' privilege ' , which the @entity8 billed as a fundraising effort to save the species			2
since publishing the application request to import the carcass , @entity12 officials have received 15,000 comments against , and 135,000 signatures on a petition to the same effect			1
it is an unprecedented response to a @entity12 application , which normally receives around eight comments per case			1
controversy : @entity5 bid $ 350,000 at a january auction for a rare permit to hunt endangered black rhinoceros in @entity27			1
his request has received an unprecedented number of responses blocking it ' i 'm not sure we 've ever received a petition quite like this one before , ' said service spokesman @entity35			2
@entity36 said the agency will examine the public comments ' for substantive information ' as it weighs whether the hunt in @entity27 — where 1,800 of the remaining 4,880 black rhinos live — is a form of conservation			0
the club said the hunt is postponed until @entity5 gets permission to import the trophy of one of five black rhinos approved by the @entity27 government for culling			0

the agency granted a permit to import a sport - hunted black rhino taken in @entity27 in 2009 , but has said it is applying extra scrutiny to @entity5 's request because of the rise in poaching			0
this is a stock photo of the rare species of black rhinoceros that mr @entity5 hopes to hunt happy hunters : @entity5 ( right ) has been leading tourist hunting trips for over a decade environmentalists say the animals are already under the gun for their prized horns , and that allowing them to be hunted is wrong			1
' kill it to save it is counterintuitive and flawed logic , ' said @entity81 , the @entity82 regional director for the @entity83			0
' the fact that some @entity55 are showing they will pay any price to kill one of the last black rhinos is not going to help the species in the long run but only continue to put a price on its head			0
