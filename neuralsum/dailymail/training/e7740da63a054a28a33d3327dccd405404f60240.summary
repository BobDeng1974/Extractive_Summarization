by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 05:39 est , 24 june 2013 a teacher has been told he can return to the classroom in just two years despite performing a series of sexually explicit actions with a string of young pupils			1
in one instance , @entity8 inflated a condom covered in baby oil and asked a boy to rub it until it burst , a disciplinary tribunal heard			1
on another occasion , the 40 - year - old talked about porn to a pupil , aged 14 , who he had befriended on @entity21 , a report into his conduct said			1
banned : @entity8 , 40 , was found guilty of ' unacceptable ' behaviour while teaching at @entity23 at @entity24 , @entity25 , pictured and an investigation into @entity8 's behaviour also found he used school computers to access pornography			1
he was found guilty of ' unacceptable professional conduct ' and not maintaining ' appropriate boundaries ' with pupils while teaching at @entity23 at @entity24 , @entity25 , and banned him from the classroom			1
but despite a report concluding that ' mr @entity8 's actions tend to indicate a deep - seated attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour ' , a decision by an @entity41 official , acting on behalf of education secretary @entity42 , paves the way for him to return teaching after just two years			1
at the end of the two year ban @entity8 will be entitled to apply to return to teaching			1
but he will first have to convince another panel from the @entity48 that he is fit to return			0
an investigation into @entity8 's conduct found : ' we consider that mr @entity8 's comments in relation to this subject were inappropriate given that he was not conducting a sex and relationship education class and there were younger pupils in the classroom			1
' it continued : ' he failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries in his relationship with a 14 - year - old student , student a , by accepting her as a friend on @entity21 , communicating with her through @entity21 on four occasions and made an inappropriate comment to her on the site by saying he was " watching porn "			1
cleared to return : married @entity75 teacher @entity74 , pictured , was deemed fit to return to teaching after being found with indecent images of children ' there was no good reason why mr @entity8 needed to befriend @entity81 and the dangers of doing so are clearly illustrated by the comment about pornography			1
' earlier this month , teacher @entity74 , 36 , was sacked , given a police caution and ordered to sign the @entity87 after admitting viewing sickening images over several years			0
but a professional conduct panel said the married @entity75 teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘ excellent teaching ’			2
a senior @entity41 official rubber - stamped the decision , saying there was a ‘ need to be proportionate and to act in the public interest ’			0
the case sparked a furious reaction from mps , schools campaigners and a children ’s charity			0
research has shown that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse children			0
in this case , @entity8 was also found to have befriended another 14 - year old girl , student b , on @entity21 and to have used @entity110 equipment to access pornographic material			1
however , an allegation that he had discussed his sex life with pupils was dismissed			0
announcing the ban @entity116 , deputy director teacher regulation at the @entity117 , said : ' mr @entity8 failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries in his relationships with students			1
' @entity121 find these actions amount to unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute			2
' the panel find that mr @entity8 's behaviour was simply not consistent with the standards that are expected of a teacher			2
they also say that it is of the utmost importance that a teacher at all times maintains a proper and professional relationship with students			0
' @entity121 also say that mr @entity8 's actions tend to indicate a deep - seated attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour , although they qualify that by saying that there is not a lengthy pattern of behaviour that proves that conclusively			2
' it is in part the cumulative impact of his conduct that lies at the heart of this case			0
although he has shown remorse , the panel have been shown no evidence in the form of references or testimonials in his support			0
' i have given careful attention to the totality of the findings in this case and to the need to be proportionate			0
i have also given careful attention to the need to balance the rights of the individual with the wider need to protect the reputation of the profession			0
' in my judgement , this case is one where the outcome should be a @entity170 to reflect the serious nature of the findings and the fact that those actions were not a one off event			0
' however , in the light of the fact that the panel identified some remorse from mr @entity8 , he said that he should be entitled to apply to have the @entity181 set aside after two years			2
@entity8 has a right of appeal to the @entity184 .			2

@entity8 found guilty of ' unacceptable ' conduct
@entity8 , 40 , got another pupil to ' rub inflated condom until it burst '
he told girl , 14 , he was watching porn after befriending her on @entity21
@entity195 imposes ban from classroom which could last just two years
