if @entity0 put as much effort into being a success at @entity3 as he did avoiding the dog in his latest @entity6 post the striker would currently be celebrating a trip to @entity9			1
but he does n't , and he was yet again blasted on sunday as @entity3 failed to get past a determined @entity10 at @entity11 , putting a potential @entity9 trip on hold			2
