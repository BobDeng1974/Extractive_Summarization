@entity0 resigned amid claims that the party had been ' infiltrated by the @entity4 occult ' a @entity6 parliamentary candidate has resigned amid claims the party has been infiltrated by ‘ occultists ’			1
teacher @entity0 was due to stand in next year ’s general election , but has stood down amid a row over a ‘ continuous campaign ’ to oust him as the candidate			1
and his allies have pointed the finger at two ‘ oddball ’ party members who run an ‘ angelic healing group ’ in the @entity17 town of @entity4			1
they say the pair are responsible for stirring up trouble at the local party branch in @entity24			2
the members in question , @entity28 and @entity27 , practise ‘ alternative healing ’ and work , according to their website , ‘ hand in hand with the @entity31 … and @entity32 ’			1
they have been described as ‘ oddballs ’ belonging to ‘ the @entity4 occult crowd ’ by one of mr @entity0 ’s allies			1
@entity39 , who has also resigned from his post as branch manager , said of the @entity42 : ‘ they put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present			0
the public can be very wary of that sort of thing			0
@entity6 has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the @entity53 or the @entity54 should be a member			0
‘ but when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list , they would n't have thought to put occultists down			0
‘ i 'm nervous about the occult and many people i know who ’ve seen that these people are involved in @entity6 have said , “ well , i 'm not voting @entity6 with them in position ”			0
these people say that they take angelic guidance and defer in all things to @entity61 – and at the same time we ’re experiencing such vitriol and bile from them			0
’ mr @entity0 , 40 , won 1,711 votes in 2010 and may have helped liberal democrat @entity73 win the @entity24 seat , which she took with a majority of just 800 over @entity77 @entity76			1
he was re-selected as @entity6 ’s @entity24 candidate in april			2
but soon afterwards he claims he became the victim of a vendetta by the @entity42			0
they say mr @entity0 is simply ‘ not up to the job ’ and deny having any vendetta			1
@entity84 , @entity6 's leader with @entity0 who was due to stand in next year ’s general election in return , his supporters say the @entity42 are just the kind of ‘ fruitcakes and loonies ’ which have dogged @entity6 ’s attempts to be seen as a serious party			1
resigning on tuesday evening , mr @entity0 explained : ‘ there has been a continuous campaign by people who , for some reason did n't want me selected , to work their very hardest to oust me			1
‘ it ’s got so bad that i really want to get out of it – i do n’t want to get involved in politics again			2
‘ i 've realised politics is a very ugly , dirty business , and i want nothing more to do with it			0
’ referring to the owners of the @entity104 and @entity105 in @entity4 , a town said to have ‘ mystic ’ properties , he said : ‘ @entity4 has many different quirky things about it , and that ’s what makes it unique i love that			1
‘ but i do n’t think it has a place in politics , especially when you are in conversation with the @entity116			0
i do n’t think i have experienced any of their [ the @entity118 ’s ] angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me			0
’ mr @entity118 stood unsuccessfully as a @entity6 candidate in the county council elections a couple of years ago , while mrs @entity27 is the @entity125 treasurer			1
he said of mr @entity39 : ‘ he accused us of being part of the occult , which is ridiculous			2
‘ what we do here has nothing to do with our involvement in @entity6			0
we ’re stalwarts of the community in @entity4			2
’ ‘ he is confused , if he thinks it is an occult he really does n't understand what we do			0
