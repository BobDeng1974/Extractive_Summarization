by @entity0 last updated at 10:38 am on 8th february 2012 a woman who had to have 20 operations to rebuild her face after being thrown from a horse is suing the keeper for huge damages			1
@entity7 , 39 , alleges she was left in persistent pain and had to give up her job after the animal trampled on her face in march 2008			2
in a @entity12 action which could have serious implications for hundreds of riding centres nationwide , the mother - of - two claims that equestrians should be granted better legal protection when riding animals that are not their own			1
the case against businessman @entity21 has already been thrown out by judge @entity22 , sitting at @entity23			1
test case : the appeal could have huge implications for riding centres nationwide but mrs @entity7 appealed the decision and today her barrister argued that the earlier judgment was unfair and left his client – and every horse rider in @entity33 and @entity34 , with no legal protection if their mount unexpectedly behaved ' nastily or viciously '			1
addressing three @entity12 judges , @entity37 described how mrs @entity7 had taken nine - year - old gelding @entity40 for a ‘ test ride ’ at @entity42 , in @entity43			1
the pair had trotted and cantered for approximately 20 minutes without any problem			0
but on the way back to the stable , @entity40 ‘ suddenly and without warning reared up full height on his hind legs ’			0
' he then bucked violently several times			0
mrs @entity7 was thrown from the horse and was then struck in the face by the horse ’s hoof , ’ mr @entity37 said			1
' her face was stamped upon by the horse			0
she has undergone 20 operations to try and rebuild her face and a remarkably good job has been done , but she still suffers persistent pain and is permanently on pain killers			0
' mrs @entity7 , who lives with her husband @entity64 and children , aged ten and six , in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , had been trying @entity40 out with the intention of buying him			2
the court was told that the horse ’s previous owner was getting rid of him after a fall which caused her to ' lose her confidence '			1
her barrister said that mr @entity21 knew this – and should have warned her @entity40 , who was being given away for free , was tricky to control before she took the animal for a ride			2
mr @entity37 argued that she should have won the original case under the @entity77 , which makes keepers of animals ' strictly liable ' if they are aware they have particular ' characteristics ' , not normally found in their species , which create a risk of serious injury			0
' the judge wrongly concluded that mrs @entity7 voluntarily assumed the risk of injury when in fact the only evidence was that the horse bucked in a violent manner so as to throw her from the horse , ' he said			1
' such behaviour could not have been expected from the horse and mrs @entity7 would not have ridden the horse if she had been aware of the risk			1
' the judge wrongly concluded she voluntarily assumed the risk of injury caused by violent bucking simply by virtue of the fact that she knew that horses could buck when spooked and cause the rider to fall off			0
' mrs @entity7 , an experienced rider , is suing for damages and loss of earnings			1
@entity105 , defending former pharmaceutical company boss mr @entity21 , said : ' neither party contended that the horse had a known propensity to buck violently			1
' mrs @entity7 consented to the risk that the horse could buck			2
it is obvious that on occasions when a horse bucks it will throw its rider			0
' the distinction mrs @entity7 seeks to draw is between general knowledge that a horse may buck and throw its rider , and knowledge that a horse may buck so violently that even an experienced rider can not stay in the saddle			2
' it is suggested that she consented to the former but not the latter			0
given that the behaviour of horses is unpredictable it is submitted that the @entity23 judge ’s approach was correct			1
' any other approach would produce a wholly unreasonable test ' , he added			0
' the court may need to consider how many bucks may be anticipated in a normal horse and how high such bucks may be - six inches off the ground ? seven inches ? eight inches ? ' why should strict liability apply to a person who voluntarily gets on the back of a horse ? ' if it does , you are going to get innocent owners penalised who know nothing of any vicious propensity in their animals			0
' it is submitted that this was a nasty , vicious horse and it bucked and reared much more than mrs @entity7 could have expected , ( but ) any horse can buck or rear and you simply do n’t know as a rider , ' mr @entity148 concluded			2
recognising the importance of the case , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 have now reserved their decision until an unspecified later date .			0

@entity7 had her case against the horse ’s keeper , @entity21 , *rejected* last year by a @entity23 judge , but is still seeking huge damages
@entity12 case has implications for riding centres nationwide
