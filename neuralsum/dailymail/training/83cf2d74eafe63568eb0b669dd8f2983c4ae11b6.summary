by @entity0 a ' misleading ' advert for an electronic cigarette brand which claimed it ' poses no health hazard ' has been banned			1
the website for @entity5 claimed the vapour inhaled and exhaled resembled smoke but was ' completely harmless '			1
watchdogs launched an investigation after a complaint the website misleadingly claimed that the product was not harmful and whether that could be substantiated			2
a person smokes a @entity13 , which the company nicocigs markets as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes following an investigation the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) found the ad breached rules regarding " misleading advertising " and ' substantiation ' and ordered that it should not appear again in its current form			1
the makers of @entity5 , @entity28 - based @entity27 , was told to ensure it did not claim products were harmless in future in the absence of adequate evidence			2
the website claimed : ' although the vapour inhaled and exhaled when using @entity13 resembles smoke , it 's simply a completely harmless vapour			1
' the vapour has no odour and does not linger the way tobacco smoke does			2
so there 's no danger of passive smoking posed to those around " vapers , " as e-cig users are called			0
it 's the tobacco that 's harmful , not the nicotine , which is mildly addictive but poses no health hazard			0
' the makers claimed the ingredients in their liquid , which was heated to create a vapour , were tested in the @entity52 and had been subject to a toxicology risk assessment to confirm that all of the ingredients were safe and the vapour caused no harm			1
they said a full safety report had also been conducted on the safety of the inhaled aerosol and it was concluded that ' it was very safe relative to cigarettes and also safe in absolute terms on all measurements we have applied '			0
@entity5 said there was a long history of research conducted on nicotine and , while there was no doubt that it was addictive , studies had shown that nicotine itself was not the cause of smoking related illnesses			0
@entity78 claim their product has converted 400,000 smokers to e cigarettes they said the same pharmaceutical grade nicotine that was used in products such as nicotine patches , gum and inhalators was used in their electronic cigarettes and they could therefore claim that the nicotine would pose no health hazard , in the same way that other nicotine delivery products would not			0
however , an @entity19 spokesman said : ' we noted the evidence @entity97 submitted , which took the form of literature reviews or references to individual ingredients in the product and also made reference to studies involving animals			1
' although we did not see any studies in their entirety , we noted one of the documents referred to a trial related to vaporising propylene glycol and children but were concerned about the small scale of the study , the fact it was not on the target audience of the claims , which we presumed to be adults , as well as about whether the ingredient tested reflected the make - up of the advertised product itself			0
' it was also unclear whether the inhalation method used reflected that users of the product would experience			0
' in addition , we noted the toxicology risk assessment , which also did not take the form of a controlled clinical trial , concluded that the e-cigarette was unlikely to pose a risk to health over and above that of cigarettes			1
' we considered , however , the implication of the ad , via claims such as ' it 's simply a completely harmless vapour ' and ' poses no health hazard ' was that the product would pose no risks to health at all			1
' for the reasons given , we considered the claims that the product was not harmful had not been substantiated and we therefore concluded that the ad was misleading			2
' he added : ' the ad must not appear again in its current form			0
we told @entity5 to ensure they did not claim products were harmless in future in the absence of adequate evidence			0

@entity13 advert claimed smoke from e cigarette was a ' completely harmless vapour '
@entity19 said this claim was misleading as it had not be substantiated
pointed out toxicology risk assessment did not take the form of a controlled clinical trial
