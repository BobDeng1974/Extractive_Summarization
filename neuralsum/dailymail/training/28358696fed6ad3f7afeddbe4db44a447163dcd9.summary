by @entity1 reporter published : 07:32 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 09:13 est , 10 december 2012 an unexpected new proposal put forward by @entity4 states to create sweeping governmental powers to regulate the @entity6 today raised fears of an expansion of online censorship			2
the plan , co-signed by @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15 , caused deep divisions when it was revealed over the weekend at a global conference which is attempting to re-write a longstanding treaty on web regulation			1
a leaked draft of the @entity11 - led proposals would block some internet locations and wrest control of allotting web addresses from a @entity27 - based body			1
it could allow governments to render websites within their borders inaccessible , even via proxy servers , and create multinational pacts in which countries could terminate access to websites at each others ' request			1
a controversial proposal for a new treaty which would give countries more powers to block websites and monitor emails has been put forward by a group of @entity4 states at a global conference in @entity46 ( above ) the coalition also wants the new treaty to include measures to combat spam email , but its definition of spam is so broad that it could be applied to almost any emailed message			1
that would provide a pretext for authoritarian regimes to suppress opponents , critics warn			1
@entity11 and its supporters , which include many @entity60 and @entity4 states , seek to formally extend the remit of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) to govern many aspects of the @entity6			1
but the @entity27 , @entity64 and other allies including @entity66 and @entity67 insist the treaty should continue to apply only to traditional telecommunications such as international wireline and wireless calls			2
the proposals have caused a deep rift between the 193 nations at the conference as the @entity76 is calling for lighter regulation of the internet countries can opt out of parts of the revised treaty when it emerges or refuse to sign it altogether			1
' if we have no agreement it will create political tension around the @entity6 , ' said @entity87 , vice president for public policy at industry think tank @entity89			2
a leaked draft of the @entity11 - led proposals would give countries ' equal rights to manage the @entity6 including in regard to the allotment , assignment and reclamation of internet numbering			1
' such moves would undermine @entity100 , a self - governing , non-profit organisation under contract to the @entity27 @entity103 , which is ultimately responsible for making sure that people trying to reach a given website actually get there			2
' much of the @entity6 was developed from @entity27 research funding , and the @entity27 has kept a residual role , so many other governments say it 's not right that one government ' controls ' the @entity6 , ' said @entity87			0
' the irony is the @entity27 has a very laid - back role and protects the internet from political interference , but the fact it 's the @entity27 makes it highly political			1
' @entity87 , vice-president of the @entity89 @entity119 , until recently the chief executive of @entity100 , which currently sits atop the addressing system , said : ' the reason some countries want to create national control over addresses is so they can have another point of control			1
' decentralising the process could prove chaotic if many countries demand that companies use only their national system			0
beyond web locations and addresses , the @entity11 - led coalition document says @entity62 member states should be able to control other elements of the @entity6 's infrastructure within their borders , as @entity11 has sought for months			1
the revision would give nations the explicit right to ' implement policy ' on net governance and ' regulate the national internet segment , ' the draft says			0
' if you throw in addressing and naming , that puts the entire ecosystem in play , which is what the @entity27 and @entity149 said they would never agree to , ' said a @entity76 participant at the conference who asked not to be named to maintain his ability to negotiate			0
' you 're almost guaranteeing lock - up in certain areas that might prevent the other areas from easily going forward , ' he said			0
the coalition wants the new treaty to include measures to combat spam email , but critics fear that would encourage authoritarian regimes to suppress opponents , while also doing little to solve what is a technical problem			1
another clause states any country should have the right to know the route of telecom traffic ' where technically feasible , ' which differs from an earlier submission and appears to acknowledge tracing internet traffic is impractical			0
' internet networks do n't follow national borders and a lot of governments are not happy with that notion , that they do n't have control over their territory , ' said @entity87			0
' some governments feel threatened , which they see as undermining their national sovereignty			0
' @entity189 was named as a co-author of the @entity11 - led submission , but on sunday it disavowed the document in what may be a sign of cracks emerging in the loose anti- @entity27 coalition			1
' our name was associated to this proposal by mere misunderstanding , ' @entity197 , a department manager at @entity189 's @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , said in an emailed statement to @entity204			0
' @entity189 has always been supporting the basic @entity6 principles that ... the @entity6 should remain free , open , liberal			0
we do not see that the @entity62 mandate deals with the @entity6			0
' the @entity27 has made a counterproposal co-signed by @entity208 that would stop the treaty being applied to @entity6 companies such as @entity213 or government and business networks			2
it say increasing the treaty 's scope could provide a platform for governments to stifle free speech , reduce online anonymity and censor @entity6 content			2
but @entity11 and its supporters argue they need new powers to able to fight cyber crime and protect networks			2
after six days of largely private talks , very little seems to have been agreed , with the main plenary committee meeting on monday to again consider the @entity27 - @entity208 proposal among others			0
the @entity62 usually agrees decisions by consensus , but the intransigence of both sides means it could come down to a vote , which may leave the @entity27 and its allies in the minority			0
' the @entity27 is not considering walking out of the conference and is still participating as normal , ' a @entity27 spokesman said in an emailed statement , denying an earlier report that the @entity27 could quit the summit , which ends on friday .			0

@entity11 , @entity13 and @entity15 among countries which signed have controversial new plan
want to create multinational pact to allow countries to stop access to sites at *eachother* 's request
includes measures that could allow authoritarian regimes to suppress opponents , critics warn
has led to deep divisions at 193 - country conference which is trying to re-write treaty on web regulation
