by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 17 october 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 18 october 2012 a mother claims she has spent a tiring three years struggling to make her 12 - year - old son attend school because he does n't like homework and finds it ' boring '			1
when her son @entity7 was younger , @entity6 used to pull him out of bed , dress him and push him through the school gates			1
but as he is nearly a teen , ms @entity6 , 37 , says he is ' much bigger and stronger ' and ' built like a mini rugby player ' , making it physically impossible for her to force him to learn			1
@entity6 , left , has battled for three years to get her son @entity7 , 12 , right , to attend school but he refuses she now faces hefty fines and being hauled before a court because of her son 's truancy			1
and surprisingly , the mother - of - four says she would welcome the decision			2
ms @entity6 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , said : ' i ’m happy to go to court if that means i will get some help			1
' she said she needs help to force her son to go to school and insists she will go to court if that is what it takes			1
she said : ' there has got to be ' some sort of change '			0
she added : ' i ’ve been trying my hardest , i used to pull him out of bed and get him dressed , push him in the car and through the school gates , but i ca n’t do that anymore			1
@entity40 : despite @entity7 's mother , right , facing hefty fines and court action , he still wo n't go to school @entity46 , @entity21 , which @entity7 attends just once a week a mother who refused to pay a fine for taking her son out of school in term time to attend her wedding in the @entity52 lost her court battle today			1
@entity54 ( pictured ) , 31 , fell foul of anti truancy laws after teenager @entity57 ( left ) was taken out of classes for 11 days so he could walk his mother down the aisle			2
mrs @entity54 had originally booked her £ 8,000 ceremony at a four star hotel in @entity63 in 2011 in the belief this year 's event would be taking place during the @entity68 holidays			2
but when she realised the @entity68 holidays for 2012 differed by up to two weeks , mrs @entity54 repeatedly tried to email @entity57 's headmistress dr @entity69 at the 1,397 pupil @entity70 in @entity72 , @entity73 to alert her			2
she was eventually refused permission to take @entity57 to the paradise ceremony - only a month before it was due to take place			0
mrs @entity54 pressed ahead and took @entity57 anyway and was then issued with a £ 50 fixed penalty notice under anti truancy laws upon her return from the 14 day trip			0
her younger son @entity81 , six , was allowed out of classes by his primary school for the luxury ceremony			2
today at @entity85 mrs @entity54 pleaded guilty under @entity86 of the @entity87 after she refused to pay the fixed penalty			0
' i ’m 5ft 3in and he ’s much bigger and stronger , he ’s built like a mini rugby player			0
' he also knows the law and says that if i touch him that it ’s assault			1
i ’m at my wits ’ end			0
' ms @entity6 was given an official warning last week and if her son 's truancy is not curbed she has been told she could face the courts			1
@entity7 is in year 8 at @entity46 but attends on average just one day a week			2
ms @entity6 said she called a meeting on friday to discuss the issue further			1
the meeting was held in ms @entity6 ’s car because @entity7 refused to get out and go into the school building			1
now @entity7 needs to attend school every day for four weeks under the ‘ fast track to attendance ’ scheme			1
any unauthorised absence will result in a £ 60 penalty notice which ms @entity6 will have to pay			2
miss @entity6 said : ' however @entity7 did not go in to school on monday or tuesday			1
' why are they prosecuting me when it should be him ? ' ' if you ’ve got a child that ’s stronger and bigger than you then what more can i do ? ' @entity6 has three other children aged 20 , 18 , and seven , and she said all of them have regularly attended school with one currently at college			1
she said : ' i ’ve had enough and i ’m absolutely sick of it			0
i ’m going to write a letter to @entity126			0
' i do n’t understand what the problem is , something needs to be done , there must be other parents in my position			0
there ’s just got to be some sort of change			0
' it ’s not fair , we need to fight back for changes to get some help			0
why should i be prosecuted when i have n’t done anything wrong ? ' she said the problems started when she fell 30ft down a quarry while @entity7 and her youngest son were there			1
' i thought he may be worried about me but it ’s been going on for years now			0
' then it was homework , then it was boring			2
he ’s very headstrong and does what he wants			0
' @entity6 has tried to make @entity7 ’s life at home unappealing in a hope that will make him go in , but she says that ’s not helping either			1
' i ’m doing everything i possibly can , i take everything away to make it boring for him and i do n’t let him go to football training			2
' meetings are all well and good but where is the action ? police officers have come and he runs off , he hides in the woods , and then they go , ' she said			0
he still finds it funny : ms @entity6 held a meeting with school officials in her car because her stubborn son wo n't go near the building @entity170 prosecuted 67 parents for their child ’s irregular attendance during the last academic year			1
of the 67 council prosecutions this year , 24 were as a result of parents not paying the penalty notice			0
@entity178 issued 203 penalty notices during the last academic year , with 143 prosecutions			0
asked about ms @entity6 ’s case , a spokesman for @entity178 said : ' parents have the ultimate responsibility to ensure their child attends school			1
' education welfare officers will work with schools and colleges to try and help with specific issues resulting in why students are not attending			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity46 said : ' we monitor attendance on a daily basis to promote the good habit of punctuality and good attendance			0
' we have a robust system to track and support any students who may be absent			0
this begins with parents contacting the college if their child is absent and is further supported by an automated service to our parents			0
