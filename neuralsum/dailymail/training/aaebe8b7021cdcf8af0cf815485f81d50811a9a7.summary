by @entity1 reporter published : 18:35 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 18:36 est , 14 december 2013 a motion - tracking device that can ' see ' through walls without using a camera could change the face of video gaming			1
researchers at @entity8 have developed the @entity10 motion tracker which uses radio waves to mark a person 's location			2
the device can plot moves and even follow gestures , meaning that a person can switch a light off in a separate room just by raising their arm			2
@entity24 relies on four antennae to plot movements			1
one sends radio waves and three receive them			0
an algorithm is then used to sift through readings caused by waves hitting household objects such as sofas			0
@entity47 , one of the researchers behind it , told @entity50 that the transmitted waves were ' structured in a particular way to measure the time from when the signal was transmitted until the reflections come back '			0
the designers behind @entity24 envision it being used for video games and to control household appliances			1
plot : movements can be tracked though a wall , above , and followed on a computer in a separate room , below with video game user , players would no longer have to remain in front of the computer , and could stalk enemies in hallways and launch ambushes from behind the sofa			1
it could also be used to help monitor elderly people who are at risk of falling , without an individual having to wear an alarm or put cameras inside their home			0
while it will be years before the device is ready for commercial release , it is already making its mark as being cheaper than other devices and also does away with the need of cameras and other wearable technology .			0

@entity24 uses radio signals to plot movements in *breakthrough* that could *improve* video games
players will no longer have to stay in front of screen and could use *furniture* to act as *obstacles* as they *fight* *virtual* enemies
