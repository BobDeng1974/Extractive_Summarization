by @entity1 reporter published : 23:12 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 07:57 est , 20 may 2012 confronting an economic crisis that threatens them all , president @entity2 and leaders of other world powers on saturday declared that their governments must both spark growth and cut the debt that has crippled the @entity10 continent and put investors worldwide on edge			1
' there 's now an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now , ' mr @entity2 proclaimed after hosting unprecedented economic talks at @entity19 , his secluded and highly secure mountaintop retreat			1
seeking a second term amid hard economic times , president @entity2 hailed a debate heading in the direction he likes , with nations now talking of ways to spark their economies instead of just slashing spending			1
members of the @entity31 including president @entity2 ( centre ) , @entity33 ( fourth from right ) and @entity35 ( third from right ) pose for their group picture @entity44 's president @entity43 ( left ) , @entity39 president @entity2 , @entity40 's prime minister @entity35 and @entity42 's prime minister @entity41 attend the first working session of the @entity46 at @entity19 , @entity47 may 19 , 2012 yet there were no bold prescriptions at hand			1
instead , leaders seemed intent on trying to inspire confidence by agreeing on a broad strategy no matter their differences			0
with all of them facing their own difficult political realities , they built some sovereign wiggle room into their pledge to take all necessary steps , saying ' the right measures are not the same for each of us			0
' mr @entity2 played international host as @entity10 's debt crisis threatens to drag down the @entity39 recovery and his own political future , underscoring the stakes for him in getting allies abroad to rally around some answers			1
much of the new emphasis on government - led growth seemed aimed at @entity74 chancellor @entity33 , who came to the summit as the @entity10 leader who had demanded austerity as the most important step toward easing the eurozone 's debt crisis			1
but the election of socialist @entity43 as president of @entity44 , and @entity85 elections that created political chaos in the country were clear rejections of the belt - tightening @entity33 represented			2
president @entity2 walks ( left ) to the podium to deliver his remarks at the end of the @entity46 at @entity19 in @entity47 mr @entity43 , a new voice at the table in just his first week on the job , offered president @entity2 a reminder of his own responsibilities to work to expand the economy , ' even if he 's in an electoral period and who has a @entity102 that 's not necessarily easy to deal with			1
' coping with shaky oil markets , the leaders set the stage for a united release of world oil reserves to balance any disruption in world markets when tough new sanctions are imposed on @entity112 's exports because of its disputed nuclear program			0
the leaders said they were ready to take ' appropriate action ' to meet any shortages			0
the mere preparation to release oil reserves could help calm markets and ensure that oil prices , which have been dropping , do n't climb again and anger consumers as @entity39 elections approach			2
the @entity31 summit includes leaders of the @entity39 , @entity125 , @entity40 , @entity74 , @entity44 , @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity42			1
the @entity31 including president @entity2 ( centre ) meet to discuss the eurozone crisis and the ability of @entity85 to remain in the @entity131 at @entity19 in @entity47 a joint summit statement reflected how urgently the countries must contain a financial crisis that could spread from the eurozone to the @entity39 and infect the rest of the global economy			1
they declared unanimity in ensuring that @entity85 , which is crippled in debt and politically gridlocked , remains as part of the 17 - member euro currency union			2
' the leaders here understand the stakes , ' mr @entity2 said in summing up a packed , unusually intimate day of world talks			2
' they know the magnitude of the choices they have to make and the enormous political and economic and social costs if they do n't			0
' mrs @entity33 said growth and deficit - cutting reinforced each other and that everyone around the table agreed			0
' that is great progress , ' she said			0
as for promoting growth , she said investments under consideration include research and development , internet networks and infrastructure			0
but she said ' this does n't mean stimulus in the usual sense			0
' president @entity2 talks to the gathered media at @entity19 on the conclusion of the @entity46 @entity42 prime minister @entity41 speaks to reporters following the @entity46 at @entity19 , @entity47 , saturday , may 19 , 2012 @entity39 officials agreed , saying growth measures that the @entity10 might pursue do n't all require outright public spending , and could be in the form of public - private partnerships or in initiatives designed to loosen credit			1
and the leaders stayed away entirely from the world ' stimulus , ' which has taken on an unpopular political connotation , including in the @entity39			2
' the global economic recovery shows signs of promise , but significant headwinds persist , ' said @entity46 leaders said			0
the tension between austerity and growth - whether to slash debt by cutting budgets or use public money and other means to help spur economic growth - was the backdrop as president @entity2 welcomed an emerging push for a balance between the two			1
there was time for light relief in the evening as @entity33 ( centre left ) and @entity35 ( centre right ) watched the @entity204 final between @entity205 and @entity206 from @entity19 he seized the opportunity to cast the debate in terms favorable to his own re-election , closing the summit with the steps he took to right the @entity39 economy and his economic vision for a second term			2
he said he was confident @entity10 could get on a path to recovery as has the @entity39			1
' we know it is possible in part based on our own experience here , ' he said			0
' in my earliest days in office , we took decisive steps to confront our own financial crisis			0
' president @entity2 chose @entity19 in part to encourage a freewheeling discussion out of sight of most media and potential protests , allowing the leaders to sit around a cabin table to negotiate terms , or stroll through the leafy paths for chats that seemed a world away from the typical summit convention - hall setting			1
it all came before mr @entity2 was to lead a much larger @entity239 in @entity240 on sunday and monday that will be heavily focused on the @entity242 war			0
the @entity31 reached an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now according to president @entity2 the drag of a eurozone crisis comes as joblessness and doubts about a life of better opportunities are already the chief concerns for @entity39 voters			1
in their united view , the leaders conceded some points about @entity33 's push for austerity , saying budget deficits must close			0
but their joint statement added that budget cutting should ' take into account countries ' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economic recovery			2
' that suggested a willingness to let indebted countries take more time to reduce their deficits in line with eurozone rules in order to lessen the deadening impact of cuts on the economy			0
it also called for ' investments in education and in modern infrastructure , ' which would involve more government spending			0
@entity35 ( centre right ) laughs with president @entity2 ( centre left ) during @entity46 talks at @entity19 , @entity47 that approach also meshes exactly with mr @entity2 's campaign - year strategy for accelerated economic growth , which is to keep spending money on core priorities while taking on the debt through cuts and higher taxes			1
the statement of support for @entity85 remaining in the euro underlines the unpredictable damage to the global financial system that could come from a @entity85 departure			1
it follows a week of increasing speculation that @entity85 might not be able to stay the course , and in which a top @entity302 official said officials were working on emergency plans in case of a @entity85 exit			0
@entity40 's prime minister @entity35 ( l to @entity307 ) , @entity39 president @entity2 , and @entity74 's chancellor @entity33 watch @entity206 vs. @entity311 final in the @entity19 conference room during the @entity46 at @entity19 , @entity47 that country is facing the most acute financial crisis of the eurozone and is set to hold elections june 17 to end political deadlock			1
at issue is whether @entity85 abandons the euro to escape austerity measures			2
meanwhile , @entity10 's woes have given shudders to @entity323			2
the @entity324 dropped @entity85 to the lowest possible grade for a country not in default thursday			0
@entity328 said @entity85 's departure from the euro ' would be probable ' if elections next month do not reverse political trends there , which have brought in politicians opposed to the terms of @entity10 's bailout .			1

' there 's now an emerging consensus that more must be done to promote growth and job creation right now , ' said president @entity2
