it has proved controversial in @entity1 and has been banned outright in @entity2 but it seems the burka does have at least one high profile supporter - the @entity5			1
' it ’s very evident that @entity8 women can be fashionable while also retaining their modesty , ' said the 49 - year - old in an interview ahead of her 50th birthday this month			2
' and it 's a great way of bringing people together , and saying , " look , this is what we 're really like "			0
' controversial : @entity5 made the controversial comments during a recent interview modest : the @entity5 said the garment proves you ' do n't have to show a lot of flesh to be beautiful ' @entity24 , who was speaking in her role as patron of the @entity27 , made the comments in an interview with the january issue of fashion bible @entity31 , which along with the article on @entity5 , features pieces on actresses @entity35 and @entity37			1
it promises titbits on ' how i stay close to @entity41 ' from ms @entity35 and further features on new season fashion , which this year includes new ways to wear nautical and the return of culottes			0
one item that is n't featured is the burka , although as the @entity5 goes on to say , most conceal a fashionable ensemble			1
' what people forget is that underneath the burka and everything else , there is somebody who is probably wearing something really quite fashionable , ' she added			0
' it proves you do n’t have to show a lot of flesh in order to be beautiful and stylish			0
' her comments are likely to prove controversial thanks to the debate surrounding the burka , which some campaigners say should be banned in the @entity1 as it is in @entity2			1
a @entity71 campaign calling on the government to ban the garment boasts 39,858 likes , while in july , a @entity76 ruling upheld @entity2 's burka ban on the grounds that it made it easier for different cultures to live together			1
nevertheless , the debate about the garment , which covers a woman from head to foot and usually masks the face , continues to rumble on , with opponents describing it as being a means of oppressing the female wearer			0
schools have also questioned whether burkas should be allowed in classrooms with teachers saying that being unable to make eye contact pupils makes it harder to teach			0
some @entity8 groups have also rounded on those who insist the garment must stay , pointing out that it is not required by the @entity102			0
debate : @entity5 , seen here with her son @entity105 , risks reigniting the debate on a @entity1 burka ban spotlight : @entity35 features in the magazine which also includes an interview with @entity37 but opponents of a ban , among them @entity113 , the director of human rights campaign group @entity114 , say the debate is fuelled by racism and not women 's rights			1
speaking to the @entity118 following the @entity76 ruling , ms @entity113 said the ban ' has nothing to do with gender equality and everything to do with rising racism in western @entity125			2
' how do you liberate women by criminalising their clothing ? if you suspect bruises under a burqa , why punish the victim , and if you disapprove of the wearer 's choices , how does banishing her from public engagement promote liberal attitudes ? ' other opponents of the @entity2 ban include @entity138 and @entity139 , an organisation that promotes tolerance of people 's religion and culture .			2

the @entity5 made the comments in @entity31
she was speaking in her role as patron of the @entity27
said it is ' very evident ' that wearers are fashionable as well as modest
the burka has long been controversial in the @entity1 and is banned in @entity2
human rights groups have opposed ban , saying it is about racism instead
