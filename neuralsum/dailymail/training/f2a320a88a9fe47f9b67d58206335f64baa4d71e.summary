by @entity0 when @entity1 learned she was pregnant with extremely rare identical triplets , she was stunned and delighted			1
but , she said , doctors took a different view of her one - in - 200million pregnancy and twice gave her an option to terminate it			1
they feared the three foetuses could take each other ’s fluid and space and might not survive			2
later in the pregnancy she was told she could choose to keep only one or two of them			2
but mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity15 were determined to have their three little girls			1
now @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 – who were born two months early on august 2 – have come home from hospital			0
delighted : @entity1 with @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , whose birth weights were 3lb 80z , 3lb 5oz and 3lb 4oz mrs @entity1 , 32 , said : ‘ the pregnancy has taken its toll but now i ’m taking my time to recover and get to know my three beautiful girls			1
‘ the doctors thought it could be up to three months before we could bring them home so we feel privileged to have them here with us			2
’ mr @entity32 , a 34 - year - old business manager , said : ‘ we could n’t consider termination – they were our babies			1
they were scanned every week to make sure they were growing fine			0
’ identical triplets occur when one egg splits in three , a one in 200million chance without @entity38 say experts			2
the couple from @entity41 , @entity42 , also have an older daughter @entity43 , aged three			1
beating the odds : ( left to right ) @entity18 , @entity45 and @entity46 with their proud parents @entity1 and @entity15 doing well : the tiny trio spent the first six weeks of their life in intensive care but have now been allowed home but medical professionals feared the rare birth and lack of space inside the womb could see the babies killing one another potentially killing one another			1
' they were concerned about twin to twin syndrome , when the babies take each other ’s fluid or space and starve or cramp each other , ' revealed their father			2
' because they are identical , they all share the same placenta and the same fluid			0
' they all grew and fought so quickly it was practically ripping @entity1 ’s muscles apart			1
' but we could n’t consider termination - they were our babies			1
we were scanned every week to make sure they were growing fine			0
' at the last scan at @entity81 in @entity1 was in very serious pain			1
the doctors gave her pain killers but she started having contractions			2
' @entity1 gave birth at the @entity88 in @entity89 , but we got transferred back for the ante natal care			1
' painful : the strain of carrying the triplets took its toll on @entity1 and she is relieved the girls are safe and healthy sister act : the @entity96 ' oldest daughter @entity43 , three , cuddles her trio of newborn siblings admin assistant @entity1 , 32 , who gave birth by caesarian section two months early , said the experience had been ' crazy ' but added that she was looking forward to getting to know her newborn daughters			1
' it ’s been crazy , ' said @entity1 , who has another daughter named @entity43 , three			1
' i still feel like someone ’s going to tell me i ’ve had my time with them now and take them away			0
' we got married , went on honeymoon to @entity111 , and came back to find out we were expecting			0
at first we thought it was one , but at eight weeks i got some really bad pains			2
we thought it was a miscarriage but it turns out it was three babies fighting for space			2
' the pregnancy has taken its toll but now i ’m taking my time to recover and get to know my three beautiful girls			0
' their personalities are already starting to shine through and i ca n’t wait to get to know them better			0
' now eight weeks old , the three girls are still tiny and weigh just six pounds - smaller than the average newborn			1
' at first they did n’t look real and you could pick them up with one hand , ' said business manager father @entity15 , 34 , who added : ' it was a bit of a shock			0
intensive care : the babies spent the first six weeks of their life at the @entity81 in @entity134 home at last : the family are now back home in @entity41 and are looking forward to getting to know each other ' now we ’ve got them home we are coming to terms with it			1
they are starting to feel like our own			0
we had a few scares during the pregnancy , especially when @entity1 fell top to bottom down the stairs			1
' our three - year - old daughter @entity43 was in bed and i was at work			0
i came home to find @entity155 on the floor			0
i still ca n’t believe we made it through			0
' ' we were worried the hospital would n’t have enough beds and we ’d have to split them up			0
it would have been horrible , ' added @entity1			1
' there was also the worry that one would be ready to come home before the others			0
luckily , we managed to keep them together			0
' the doctors thought it could be up to three months before we could bring them home so we feel privileged to have got them here with us so soon			2
' @entity170 , press office for @entity81 , said : ' the midwives were all thrilled to have a triplet birth at the @entity88			0
' everyone involved has taken great care of the girls to ensure their speedy return home			0
we all wish [ the ] proud parents @entity15 and @entity1 all the very best for the future			1
