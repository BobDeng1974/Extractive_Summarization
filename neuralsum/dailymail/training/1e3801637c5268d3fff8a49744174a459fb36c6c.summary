@entity0 said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was ' damaging ' the cause of justice rape and domestic violence are not being investigated properly by police because of a ‘ misplaced belief ’ that false allegations are rife , the @entity9 has warned			1
@entity0 said the idea that women were regularly crying rape when none had in fact taken place was ‘ damaging ’ the cause of justice			2
a study published today by the @entity22 shows only a handful of false allegations of rape were made in 2011 and 2012			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ because people recognise the devastating effect of false allegations and because they perceive there to be more false allegations than this report would suggest there are , arguably they adopt a cautious approach			1
‘ that can lead to injustice for victims			0
’ the study reveals that over a 17 - month period between january 2011 and may 2012 – when all false allegation cases were referred to the @entity9 – there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape , but only 35 for making false allegations of rape			1
likewise , there were 111,891 prosecutions for domestic violence , but only six for making false allegations of domestic violence			1
a further three people were charged with making false allegations of both rape and domestic violence			1
furthermore , the study found that a significant number of the false allegation cases involved ‘ young , often vulnerable people , and sometimes even children ’			2
around half were brought forward by people aged 21 and under , with some involving people with mental health difficulties			0
‘ from the cases we have analysed , the indication is that it is extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice , ’ mr @entity0 added			1
‘ it is within this context that the issue should be viewed , so that myths and stereotypes around these cases are not able to take hold			0
’ a report into @entity77 says the shamed @entity80 star 's sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims ' complaints and mishandled evidence earlier this week a separate report by @entity86 showed how police mishandled allegations against @entity77 – in many cases because they did not believe the reports of his victims			2
the report concluded the shamed @entity80 star ’s sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as 1964 if police had not dismissed his victims ’ complaints and mishandled evidence			2
the latest report by the @entity22 is the first of its kind			1
it is part of a wider programme to improve the agency ’s handling of cases involving violence against women and girls			0
in the foreword to the report , mr @entity0 writes that victims of rape and domestic violence ‘ must not be deterred from reporting the abuse they have suffered ’ by popular misconceptions about rape and domestic violence			2
‘ in recent years we have worked hard to dispel the damaging myths and stereotypes that are associated with these cases , ’ he said			0
‘ one such misplaced belief is that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife			1
this report presents a more accurate picture			0
’ mr @entity0 last week announced radical measures in the way the criminal justice system tackles child sexual abuse to prevent ‘ another @entity77 moment in five or ten years ’ time ’			0
he will replace the 19 practice guidelines that have been introduced over the past ten years with a single policy for @entity134 and @entity135			0
the raft of measures is intended to ‘ draw a line in the sand ’ in the way child sex offenders are handled by the authorities			0
mr @entity0 said prosecutors and police will now be expected to ‘ explore patterns of behaviour and links to other cases ’ instead of just focusing on the account of the victim .			0
