by @entity1 reporter published : 19:44 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 19:44 est , 28 november 2013 @entity2 yesterday sent warplanes into a disputed region of the @entity5 it has claimed as within its air defence zone - days after @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 flew through the area			1
state media reported that the country plans to take ‘ defensive emergency measures ’ if any aircraft flying through the zone fail to identify themselves			1
@entity2 ’s air force sent several fighter jets and an early warning aircraft on normal air patrols into the area , air force spokesman colonel @entity23 told the @entity25 agency			2
the report did not specify exactly when the flights were sent or whether they had encountered foreign aircraft			0
@entity2 sent warplanes into a disputed region of the @entity5 it has claimed as within its air defence zone ( stock photograph ) it happened after the @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 said they have sent flights through the zone without encountering @entity2 response since @entity40 announced the creation of the zone last week			1
the zone includes an area of sea where gas had been discovered , which previously was only in an air defence zone marked out by @entity9			1
both countries regard any land there as within their economic zones , meaning they claim the exclusive right to any income to be made from the territory			0
the row centres on airspace to the north east of what the @entity9 call the @entity59 , and what @entity2 calls the @entity59			0
@entity61 also lays claim over the @entity59 islands , and @entity10 maintains claims over a submerged rock in the northern part of @entity2 ’s new air defence zone			1
@entity2 ’s reassertion of its sovereignty over the area yesterday marked a worrying escalation of the dispute			0
col @entity23 described the flights as ‘ a defensive measure and in line with international common practices			0
’ he said @entity2 ’s air force would remain on high alert and will take measures to protect the country ’s airspace			1
@entity2 says the establishment of the zone was ‘ completely justified and legitimate ’			2
the row centres on airspace to the north east of what the @entity9 call the @entity59 , and what @entity2 calls the @entity59 without prior notice , @entity40 began demanding on saturday that passing aircraft identify themselves and accept @entity2 instructions or face consequences			2
the move has been widely condemned , however , with @entity8 describing it as a ‘ destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region ’			0
concerns have grown over an escalation in tensions because both @entity2 and @entity9 have large naval fleets in the waters around the @entity5			2
some experts believe the spark for the latest action is thought to have been @entity9 ’s threat last month to shoot down drones @entity2 says it will send to the @entity59 / @entity59 islands for mapping expeditions			0
while @entity2 ’s surprise announcement last week to create the zone initially raised tensions in the region , some analysts believe @entity40 ’s motive was not to trigger an aerial confrontation but a more long - term strategy to solidify claims to disputed territory by simply marking the area as its own			1
@entity2 ’s lack of efforts to stop the foreign flights - including two @entity8 b - 52s that flew through the zone on tuesday - has been an embarrassment for @entity40			0
even some @entity2 state media outlets suggested on thursday that @entity40 may have mishandled the episodes .			1
