last updated at 4:09 pm on 27th october 2011 an inquest into the death of a former nurse who underwent a gastric bypass operation was told today that surgeons may have made a crucial miscalculation during her weight - loss surgery			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , lost ten stones in six months after the radical surgery at the @entity12 in august 2010			0
@entity13 heard how the mother - of - three , who suffered from type two diabetes , asthma and high blood pressure , was admitted to the hospital ' with vomiting and extreme weight loss ' in may			0
tragic : @entity8 , pictured with her grandchild before the operation , was worried about having the gastric bypass she was malnourished and her weight had dropped to eight stone by the time she was admitted for medical help			1
two days after the 67 - year - old was admitted she died after the weight - loss procedure carried out at @entity30 in august 2010			0
the inquest also heard that medics monitoring her progress after the surgery considered that the she had been doing well in the months following her treatment			1
but an expert witness explained that surgeons may have got their measurements wrong when carrying out the procedure			1
the inquest heard that it was possible that the common channel had been cut too short to be able to absorb food			1
surgeon @entity45 explained to the court how the routine operation would have been performed by disconnecting and cutting the stomach and creating a newer smaller stomach , known as the gastric pouch			1
fatal operation : @entity8 died in hospital in @entity9 after she lost more than ten stones following a gastric band operation he said this would allow food to bypass the original stomach completely but still be absorbed			1
however trainee surgeon , @entity59 , who carried out the operation alongside consultant bariatric surgeon @entity61 told the court that the operation had been carried out to ' standard procedure ' and that ' nothing unusual ' took place			1
coroner @entity68 - @entity67 added : ' it seems from all the evidence we 've heard at the minute that something in the operation has gone wrong and this has resulted in malabsorption taking place and as a result @entity77 has died			1
' it seems surgery in august had effectively gone awry in a way that resulted in her being unable to absorb nutrition appropriately or correctly			1
' during questioning , mr @entity61 said that , if the operation had gone wrong , he would have expected mrs @entity8 , known as @entity85 , to have shown symptoms , such as diarrhoea , within weeks			2
the inquest heard that her post-operative progress was what would have been expected until december			2
mrs @entity8 's gp , dr @entity92 , told the hearing that , when she saw her for the first time in march last year , her body mass index ( @entity95 ) was dangerously high at 47.6 and , after talking to her about different ways of losing weight , she referred her to @entity99			0
the retired @entity101 nurse was then initially assessed by clinical specialist @entity102			1
@entity104 : the hospital where mrs @entity8 underwent her gastric bypass surgery in august last year she told the inquest she first met mrs @entity77 in may last year and felt that she did not fully understand the operation that she would undergo			1
however after further consultations with other experts at the hospital she was deemed to have passed the assessment and was given the go - ahead for surgery			0
mrs @entity102 said that divorcee mrs @entity8 weighed 18st 10lb before the operation and that following the gastric bypass she passed on her mobile phone number and that of another nurse should she experience any difficulties			2
at the same time she was given a timetable outlining how long she should consume only liquids and she could restart eating solids			0
the grandmother 's gp said that her patient had seemed ' very pleased with her surgery and very cheerful ' and that her blood pressure had dropped			0
her son @entity128 , 47 , said at the time of his mother 's death that she had been desperate to lose weight before visiting her daughter in @entity134 but was ' extremely reluctant ' to go under the knife			2
the father - of - two said : ' she was questioning it right up until the last minute but eventually had it done			0
' ' she was being sick all the time			0
everything she ate just came straight back up			0
it was heartbreaking to watch because she just kept trying to stay smiling and happy			0
' she was sure there was something wrong but when she was re-admitted to hospital for a couple of weeks she came home saying they thought it was in her imagination			0
' @entity149 told there was nothing wrong , that it was a normal reaction to the surgery , made her lose confidence in herself and feel like she could n’t keep asking			2
' a spokesman for the @entity155 said shortly after her death : ' the trust very much regrets mrs @entity8 ’s death and our sympathies are with her family			2
