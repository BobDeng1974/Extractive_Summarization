by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:50 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:45 est , 20 december 2013 once the laminated book of dreams , the @entity4 catalogue has been every child 's @entity8 companion since it first emerged in the 1970s			1
a treasure trove of cutting - edge gadgets and must - have toys , it was the bible of the day 's popular culture			1
people would eagerly flick through the synthetic pages with a pen compiling a detailed list of product codes for @entity8 to reference			2
throwback : this 1973 edition of the iconic catalogue is a telling glimpse into the fads of the day , and the nation 's tastes			1
a secure family unit was a key marketing feature in 2013 , the front cover is cleared of smiling children and loving parents to make way for glitzy gadgets and bright colours with an advert for where to do your shopping 70s prices : back then , a rowing machine would only set you back £ 13.95 , compared to prices nearing £ 200 today			1
the models look like they 're having a playful time now , exercise is a solitary activity , and the model looks strained ; pushed to the limit			0
compared to the basic stock in 1976 , there are pages of equipment to choose from now three decades ago , the toys pages were void of beaming children and shiny colours to inspire their young shoppers			1
the pictures and toys are simple now , children want their own miniature versions of real - life cars like @entity61 that they can drive around with a remote control nostalgia : vintage collector @entity63 was amazed by the reactions from nostalgic shoppers when he shared the images of this dull - coloured 1976 edition online 1976 index : for shoppers desperate to flick straight to bread bins , dress forms , eternity rings , valet stands and typewriters , here are the pages children would sift through the wad of cutting - edge toys to note down product codes for @entity8			1
the news that the catalogues are ending was met with uproar @entity83 : the @entity84 was one of the nation 's favourite imports from @entity87 , and the figurine was essential for young boys			0
@entity90 were loved but faulty when store directors this year announced plans to go digital in the near future , millions of nostalgic shoppers were dismayed			2
but today , in a wistful tribute to the institution , a collector has unveiled one of the store 's first catalogues before the marketing revolution disappears into history			1
and they offer an incredible glimpse into the ever - changing tastes of @entity106 shoppers			1
in the booklet , found in a carboot sale by vintage collector @entity63 , models with @entity109 - flicked locks and glossed lips and men with helmet hair and @entity116 tracksuits posed with the 1976 must - haves , from instamatic @entity119 cameras to metal typewriters and gas coal - effect fires			1
just three decades on , typewriters are vintage collectors items that can cost hundreds			2
these are as little as £ 29.95			0
and a box advertises £ 1 gift vouchers for a wedding present writers today need a laptop , which can cost £ 399.99 if you 're lucky			1
the curved edges and soft , pastel colours of typewriters have been replaced with harsh edges and sleek black no house was complete without a record player			0
the catalogue puts a great deal of emphasis on on manual control of the sound on there £ 25 machines before the advent of ipods and mp3 players , a portable radio was the must - have accessory for young things walking around @entity106			1
the chunky devices were considered lightweight dramatic change : with technological advances , stereos can now be all shapes and sizes - usually enormous and dwarfing the sleek little iphone nestled inside it the whole booklet is a vision of orange and brown , featuring homes brimming with @entity162 furniture and patio sun loungers , complete with bronzed men in blinding white exercise gear			2
customers are invited to by state - of - the - art twin turntables on which to play all those early @entity168 , listened to through wooden speakers ( brown , of course )			2
it was the year of bell - bottom jeans , @entity173 , @entity174 , and disco			2
cassette tapes took off , and people without a walkman strapped to their pocket simply were n't worth the time of day			0
alternative and herbal medicines such as acupuncture started moving into @entity106 and from @entity182 as the nation embraced spirituality			0
glass eating and star wars action figures also made their debut			0
' @entity188 ' was the word on the street , where the trendy young things wore jackets inspired by @entity193 from @entity194			0
watches are glistening gold and opulent - compared to today 's practical , sleek , black gadgets			1
typewriters , adding machines , cassette players and ashtrays are just some of the things that either no longer appear or have a minimal amount of space now dedicated to them			0
but it is not only gadgets which have changed , as the pictures also show how far the nation 's obsession with body image and personal grooming has developed since the 1970s			2
whereas the 70s version shows a happy family gathered around the catalogue , the cover of the 2013 edition shows a tablet pc displaying the @entity4 website and a range of online purchasing options			1
the contents pages of the old catalogue list just one page of ' keep fit equipment ' , whereas the 2011 version has a staggering 40 pages of various sports gear			1
and while today 's man looks for an electric razor which moisturises his skin as he shaves , a sideburn trimming feature was the @entity234 which attracted the rugged 70s bloke			2
when it was launched in 1973 , @entity4 revolutionised the way we shopped			1
back then — before the computer age , and when there was only one commercial tv channel on which to advertise — the catalogue was a quick and inspiring way to reach customers at home			2
the original allure of the catalogue was in its aspirational products and fantasy homes — all of which was in your grasp , with a little help from @entity4			1
while browsing the pages at home , you could compare these fabulous homes and the happy families in them with your own living room and life , which suddenly seemed somewhat lacking			0
having scanned and uploaded every single page , mr @entity63 has shared the images which shed light on the way we used to live			1
and he was overwhelmed by the response from people who had fond childhood memories of the products featured within			0
he said : ' the images act as a way to connect with people to discover their stories , their past and their memories			0
' for example , people see teddy bears that they owned , or games consoles that they longed to own as a teenager and the catalogues also shed light into how it was to live back then			0
' looking at the catalogues makes people remember parts of their life that they had forgotten			0
' it is sad that the catalogues are being phased out but i guess it is a sign of the times			0
' in many ways catalogue shopping was a radical approach back in the day and it has slowly been replaced by the web			0
vintage collectors now clamour for items like the @entity295 camera , top right , which went for £ 3.95 in 1976 and with film would be more than 20 times the price today shiny : glittering colours , swirling patterns and optical zooms are the order of the day today and the page design crams far more information in around the cut - out images the @entity308 bike was at its height of popularity for teenagers to cruise around the streets , advertised by cyclist @entity314 , sporting some timely sideburns now : style has been shunned for substance as customers are now given close - up views of the bike 's suspension and details of the gear type gold : accessories were glamourous in 1976 , and there was never such a thing as too much gold			1
the layout is reminiscent of a jeweller 's store , with simple boxed photos multi-purpose : now , gold is gone			0
watches are a practical device that can tell you the date , time , your location , and hydration levels			0
they resist water and have in - built alarms the @entity344 , which sold for £ 11.95 , was a heavy - duty hairdressing kit for those bouffant manes that @entity174 and @entity347 inspired in the 1970s edgy : grooming has now lost its soft , feathered edge in favour of lasers , bright lights and photoshopped graphics - and prices rocketing past £ 200 playthings : the must - have toys of the day were air hostess dolls and @entity359 dolls			1
there is also the first sign of ' tiny tears ' dolls which drink , cry and wet their nappies the tiny tears toys are still a favourite today , but marketed with an adorable young girl , and a tumult of extra accessories ' it is all about technology making things even more convenient and easy for the customer now			2
' let 's see if it works out as great as the catalogues			0
' earlier this year @entity4 revealed plans to launch six ' digital only ' stores which would do away with the traditional catalogue seen at its other 732 outlets in the @entity106 and @entity382			1
this month the stores attracted controversy after customers reserved items online for instore pick - up , only to find them closed when they arrived .			0

the pages are telling of our changing tastes in gadgets , toys , the way we want to look - and how prices have *inflated*
it is a wistful throwback following the outrage caused recently as @entity4 announced the catalogue will be *scrapped*
