mr @entity33 said @entity10 deliberately targeted young women by introducing himself as a prospective employer looking for a nanny to travel with him on his boat , caring for his young son			1
four of the women who fell for the lure , said mr @entity50 , were drugged by @entity10 before he took advantage of them			1
the 17 - year - old was initially offered a job in 1986 as a receptionist at a motel he owned in @entity32 , but when she turned up to start her employment she was told he had been called to his yacht , moored nearby , and she should meet him there			1
on board , they discussed terms and conditions of employment and @entity10 and his intended victim celebrated with a glass of champagne , although she took only ‘ a couple of sips ’ , said the prosecutor			2
but as they sat in the galley , he forced himself onto her and raped her			0

she told police and she was able to identify @entity10 on a police photo board			2
' sophisticated tactics ' : @entity10 promised his victims a life of luxury on board his yacht , the @entity40 , in @entity32 , @entity4 the prosecutor said @entity10 ’ tactics ‘ grew more sophisticated ’ as he went on to hire and then rape another six young women in ‘ remarkably similar circumstances ’			1
