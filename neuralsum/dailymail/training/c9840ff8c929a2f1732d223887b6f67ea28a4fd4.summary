by @entity0 to millions of her subjects she is the ultimate @entity2			0
now @entity3 is turning her attention to the plight of @entity7 ’s honey bees , and funding grants from £ 500 to £ 1,000 to encourage people to set up beehives on @entity12 land			1
one condition for the grants is learning to distinguish queen bees from workers			1
funding : the @entity17 will offer out grants of up to £ 1,000 for those willing to keep bees on her estate the queen is apparently concerned by the rapid decline in @entity7 ’s bee colonies linked to the varroa mite which has also devastated honeybees in the @entity27 and mainland @entity28			1
other causes include poor weather , pesticides and pollution			0
without pollination by bees , @entity7 ’s crops will suffer			0
beekeeping enthusiasts include tv celebrities @entity38 and @entity39 , but many are put off by the cost			0
so the @entity42 , which provides a personal income to the @entity45 , has launched the start - up grants for tenant farmers or anyone else willing to keep hives on its 46,000 acres in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
the cash will be used for people to attend a training course , which costs about £ 60 for six three - hour sessions ; to purchase a hive , which varies from £ 250 to £ 350 ; to buy a swarm of bees for about £ 150 , and a protective suit with veiled helmet and gloves at £ 70 to £ 120			1
recipients will also have to join a local beekeepers ’ association which costs about £ 30 a year			2
there is no limited cash pot for the grants , and each application will be decided on merit			2
@entity75 , the @entity12 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ as a responsible landlord , the @entity42 is acutely aware of the need to protect the natural environment and supporting the bee population is an intrinsic part of that			0
’ beekeepers will be encouraged to keep the @entity7 native dark bee , or black bee , which is more resistant to @entity7 weather .			0

@entity17 will offer grants of up to £ 1,000 to encourage beekeepers
they will be available to those who start hives in @entity12
the cash will *pay* for training , hives , protective gear - as well as the bees
