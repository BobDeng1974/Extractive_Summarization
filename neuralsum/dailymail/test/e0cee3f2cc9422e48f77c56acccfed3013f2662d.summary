deported : @entity7 , left , has been told he must leave @entity14 and move to @entity3 weeks after the death of his brother @entity19 , pictured right receiving an award for bravery the family first came from @entity3 to the @entity14 in october 2007 to live with @entity7 and @entity19 's father , who was studying for a phd			1
@entity19 was subsequently diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma , a type of childhood cancer which attacks connective tissue in the face and left him severely disfigured			1
after years of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , he fell ill with meningitis , and died on march 4			1
the @entity12 denied the family 's request to stay in the @entity14 after their visa expired in 2013			1
