@entity8 beat plucky amateur @entity3 6 - 2 at @entity11 's @entity10 , coming through after a tricky first half of the match			1
it has often been said that the five - time world champion could win a snooker match with all manner of handicaps enforced , and playing on a broken left ankle after a fall while running backs that up			1
@entity0 was clearly in during his first round match at the @entity2 but for all the admirable courage shown , @entity0 admitted afterwards he will not start sunday 's second - round match against @entity26 veteran @entity25 or @entity28 's @entity27 if he has felt no improvements			1
' the injury is disappointing , a broken ankle			2
it is not too comfortable and i did n't enjoy any of that , ' the 38 - year - old said at his post-match press conference			2
' i thought i would give it a go but if it does n't improve i 'm not sure i 'm going to play my next match			2
' i ca n't get on the shot properly , i 'm hobbling around , it 's swelling up and it 's painful			2
' i 've taken all the painkillers , done all i can do , and if it 's not better by sunday i probably wo n't play			1
' @entity8 beat plucky amateur @entity3 6 - 2 at @entity11 's @entity10 on thursday a withdrawal from the sport 's most popular player would be a severe blow for the tournament but would , even at such an early stage , open the field up			1
@entity0 has looked near - unbeatable since his return to the main tour after a self - imposed year - long exile , and he was a short - priced favourite to win a fifth @entity58 title			1
the @entity60 man has cited running as one of the key reasons why he has finally beaten the mental troubles that plagued his career			2
he revealed in his recent autobiography , entitled ' running ' , that he had contemplated quitting snooker all together and dedicating himself to athletics			0
now , though , he says he is going to put the trainers away until he retires			0
' i am absolutely gutted			0
i am enjoying my snooker more than ever and to do that through running - i am really angry with myself , ' he said			2
' i am so annoyed at myself			0
i think i will probably stop running now until the end of my snooker career because you ca n't do this			0
@entity0 gets on a shot against @entity3 but broken ankle could force him to pull out of tournament @entity0 tweeted picture of his broken left ankle on tuesday ' it 's the third time i have broken my foot			1
i fell over in the forest			0
i was running with my mate and he 'd asked me what time i was doing on the run			0
i looked at my watch and i just lost my footing and i slipped			0
partly his fault , partly my fault and i am frustrated with myself because i am a snooker player , not a runner			0
i just should n't do it			0
' @entity0 was not the only walking wounded at @entity11 , with two - time world champion @entity98 beating @entity99 6 - 1 despite a muscle injury picked up during weight training			1
@entity102 also won by that scoreline against @entity104			0
elsewhere , 1997 world winner @entity105 beat @entity106 , @entity107 avoided a shock loss to @entity109 while @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 also progressed			0
