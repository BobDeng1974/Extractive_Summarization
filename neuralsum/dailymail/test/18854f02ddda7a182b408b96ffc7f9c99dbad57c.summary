a telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by @entity4 doctors , cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes			1
when tumours in the lungs are suspected , patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease , often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment			1
now doctors at @entity15 ( @entity16 ) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure			1
it even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer			1
the procedure involves inserting the @entity26 down the throat , guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube			1
an ultrasound scanner attached to one end of the tube takes a scan while a small needle takes a tissue sample			0
findings from a three - year trial at @entity16 reveal that the method halves the time it takes between a patient ’s first hospital appointment and for a decision to be made on the best course of treatment			2
@entity26 patients wait an average of 14 days for a decision , compared with 29 days for those diagnosed via more conventional techniques			2
and as well as getting a quicker diagnosis , patients who have undergone ebus survive for longer			2
doctors at @entity15 ( pictured ) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure they survive for 503 days after diagnosis , compared with 312 days for people assessed through more traditional methods			1
this is probably due to the fact that @entity26 can more accurately diagnose the type of cancer involved and therefore the type of treatment needed			1
consultant dr @entity67 , who has been testing the technique , said the results had been so impressive that he now hoped the procedure would be rolled out across the @entity4			2
‘ ebus routinely prevents the need for scans , tests and operations and speeds up the route to the correct treatment , ’ he says			1
he adds : ‘ the trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better – it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost			1
’ @entity83 political editor @entity82 announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year more than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the @entity89 every year , yet the disease is notoriously difficult to treat as it is often spotted at a late stage			1
the @entity83 ’s political editor @entity82 announced earlier this year that doctors had found a tumour on his lung , and he has since undergone a successful operation to remove the growth			2
diagnosing lung cancer can be a challenge – x-rays are not always definitive as it is hard to distinguish between cancer and other lung conditions			2
a biopsy is the traditional way to check conclusively whether a patient has lung cancer			2
however , obtaining a tissue sample can be difficult as lung cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes in the chest and these are hard to reach			0
this means that surgery may be necessary before a doctor can be sure that the disease is present , resulting in a wait for results			0
the health of many cancer patients can deteriorate because these delays mean they are not started immediately on lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy			1
by comparison , the @entity26 allows doctors to look directly into the windpipe and breathing tubes , while the ultrasound scanner can check the lymph glands in the centre of the chest for cancer			1
one patient who received faster treatment thanks to the @entity26 technique is retired sales worker @entity133			0
the 65 - year - old from @entity135 , @entity136 , had already had a tumour removed from her lung in september 2013 , and underwent a double mastectomy the following march after being diagnosed with breast cancer			0
then in june last year , she began to feel breathless while on holiday in @entity142			0
when she returned home to @entity89 , she was given the devastating news that she had a new lump behind her breastbone			0
her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further , so they recommended she have the pioneering @entity26 procedure			1
‘ they said i was a very sick lady , ’ reveals @entity133			0
‘ my consultant explained the procedure to me and i was taken into the operating theatre and sedated			0
it was all over so quickly – there were no side effects from the procedure , no dry mouth or sluggishness , and i felt really positive about the whole process			0
’ the @entity26 revealed @entity133 had small cell carcinoma , a form of lung cancer that can spread quickly , and she needed a course of chemotherapy immediately			0
she started treatment the next day , and after six months of chemo , the tumour was gone			0
‘ the ebus was brilliantly efficient , ’ adds @entity133			0
‘ by 4pm that day , my cancer had been diagnosed and the appropriate chemotherapy was ordered for me to start the next day			1
‘ had i had a traditional biopsy , who knows where i ’d be			0

when tumours in lungs are suspected , patients can face a raft of tests
some even need surgery to find out before lifesaving treatment can begin
now doctors at @entity15 are able to start vital treatment much sooner after single procedure
it even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer
