although the @entity3 first round is new territory for @entity5 , their manager @entity0 does have cup experience to draw upon , and not only as the younger brother of former @entity9 star @entity8			1
as a @entity11 player , he remembers standing toe to toe in the tunnel with @entity15 for a @entity17 tie when @entity19 's @entity18 were in their pomp			1
' @entity15 said to me : ' i 've done your kid and i 'm going to do you '			1
i knew then it was going to be a battle , ' recalls @entity0			1
former @entity27 boss and current @entity29 manager @entity26 , alongside brother @entity0 @entity0 is determined to follow in his brother 's footsteps and make the grade as a manager ' he was taller than me but i used to like them big			1
we kicked seven bells out of each other , we might as well not have had a ball , and some of the things that were said would get you put in jail today			2
' after the game we had a pint in the lounge at @entity45 and he said : ' @entity46 , i thought i was the maddest footballer on the planet '			2
' so @entity0 is not the type to be intimidated by @entity50 @entity49 in the first live @entity3 tie to be screened by the @entity52 since 2008			1
having spent his career in @entity8 's shadow , tonight is @entity0 's time in the spotlight			1
he is the first @entity5 manager in their 65 - year history to take them to this stage of the cup			1
to do it from the @entity62 — the eighth tier of @entity65 football — is some achievement , which is why their fans snapped up the 2,500 tickets within hours			1
their @entity5 ground , by the @entity70 , has never seen anything like it			1
average home gates rarely top 250 and the @entity5 players earn about £ 80 a week			2
@entity76 takes time out for a coffee ahead of his side 's @entity3 meeting with @entity49 on friday night @entity0 , 49 , says : ' i am a hothead , i wear my heart on my sleeve and i probably need to calm down or i 'll have a cardiac arrest			1
if you can get 18 or 20 people in the dressing room with the same desire , you can achieve			2
' my problem is i can not accept people going onto a football field and not giving everything			0
you 're not always going to have the best match in the world but you can stop your opponent from having the best match			0
' sometimes that passion has spilled over and he has received more than one touchline ban for berating referees			0
but @entity0 , who played more than 400 games in the @entity105 , has worked hard to tone down his behaviour and promises he will not be swearing on the touchline as this game will be beamed into family homes all around the country			2
eighth tier outfit @entity5 take on @entity50 side @entity49 in the @entity52 televised @entity3 game ' officials are in the game to improve as well — i try to improve them ! ' he smiles			1
' one thing i wo n't do is jeopardise my club and its standing in the community			0
unless they have an unbelievably good bleep machine , you wo n't hear me using bad language			0
the dressing room will be my domain , in there i will be myself			0
' ' i do overstep the mark at times but i am improving			0
i take advice from people , i speak to @entity8 because he 's been through most things in football and he knows me inside - out			1
' what differentiates @entity5 from most non-league underdogs is that there is potential to grow			2
' i was brought in by @entity135 ( @entity5 's chairman ) to try and achieve @entity137 status , ' said @entity0			1
' @entity5 is supposed to be a rugby league town but i do n't believe that because there are more kids playing football than rugby			2
@entity26 celebrates promotion to the @entity145 with @entity27 at @entity146 in 1999 the 58 - year - old also managed @entity148 for a brief spell in 2003 ' there are 200,000 people in this town and the @entity154 average gate is about 10,000			1
so there are 190,000 people out there who might just want to come and watch a football team			0
' ' this cup game is a start			0
words ca n't describe how special it is for the people who have worked behind the scenes for years			0
' we 've come so far			0
i joined in 2012 when we did n't have any players			0
i used to take a clipboard with the names of 50 players coming in for trials			0
' players to look out for include goalkeeper @entity178 , rated one of the best outside the @entity137 , defender @entity176 whose brother is @entity180 boss @entity178 , and former @entity182 trainee @entity181			2
@entity183 , a fitness instructor nicknamed ' @entity185 ' by team - mates because of his beard and flowing locks , scored the goal against @entity190 that got @entity5 here			1
@entity192 winner @entity191 , who played for @entity5 between 1955 and 1958 when they were known as @entity193 , still lives locally and joined the squad for the first - round draw			1
the 49 - year - old looks on during a training session with @entity5 last week for all the success he enjoyed at @entity182 under @entity198 , he never forgot his first club			1
' i owe @entity5 a lot , ' says @entity191			2
' it was our manager at the time , @entity204 , who persuaded me to join @entity182 rather than @entity206 even though they were offering less money			0
he said i 'd be happier staying in the north west			0
i am glad i took his advice			0
' one of @entity5 's directors is their local mp @entity211 , who joined other businessmen to save the club from administration in 2008			2
@entity211 said : ' we are closely knitted into the fabric of community life			0
' it is hard to think @entity5 's big night under the lights would have been possible without @entity0 , whose obsession with football once saw him walk out on a career 's advisor at school who suggested farming			1
' football is my fix , the thing that gets me up in the morning , ' he said			0
' you ca n't explain to people who say it 's ' just football '			0
please do n't say that , particularly when you see how special this has been			0

@entity0 is looking to follow in the footsteps of his brother @entity8
his older brother has managed the likes of @entity27 and @entity148
@entity76 was a no - *nonsense* *midfielder* like @entity8
@entity15 told @entity76 that he was a crazier footballer than him
