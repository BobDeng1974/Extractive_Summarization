by @entity0 in the film @entity2 , @entity3 the zebra famously wonders whether he is black with white stripes or white with black stripes			2
this one is neither - and was was spotted in @entity8 by wildlife photographer @entity9 who says in all his 25 years in @entity10 , he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat			1
he says , unlike most zebra , it has never travelled with a herd and has a nasty temper if ever anyone gets close			0
spot the difference : zebras are normally social animals but appear to have banished this unusual specimen because of his spotty back remarkable : the zebra was pictured by wildlife photographer and safari guide @entity9 who says in all his 25 years in the wilds of @entity10 , he has never seen a zebra with such an unusual coat @entity9 first came across the animal a couple of years ago whilst guiding in @entity8 from @entity31 , a set of camps he owns , and has tracked its movements ever since			1
he said : ' this animal was on its own , extremely bad tempered and i could not get a shot			0
' no - one believed me when i told them of this remarkable phenomenon			0
this time , on a long game drive in the @entity44 i saw him again			2
' he appears to have no mates and a lot of scars , however the differences are vast			0
unique body - prints : zebra are usually very sociable creatures who like to travel in herds			0
some experts say they developed stripes over time to help them recognise each other thinking : in the film @entity2 , @entity3 the zebra famously wonders whether he is black with white stripes or white with black stripes ' the mane is short and completely black the hooped markings on its legs are completely different to normal ones , it has the shape of a donkey it is much darker all over , but those spots are incredible			1
' every zebra in @entity10 has slightly different markings , but this one has taken that to extremes			0
' @entity9 guides wildlife photographic holidays for @entity75 all over the world , but specifically in the poles and @entity10			0
experts have come up with a variety of explanations as to why zebra have stripes			2
the stripey patterns that cover their bodies are as distinctive as human fingerprints and some scientists say they evolved in such a way to make it easier to recognise each other			1
others say it is to confuse predators when they bunch into groups to avoid attack			1
and this year a group of scientists came up with the theory that zebra developed stripes to keep blood - sucking flies at bay after putting out different coloured models of horses in a field - one brown , one black , one white , and one with black - and - white stripes			1
the model with black - and - white stripes attracted the least number of flies .			2

the *bizarre* specimen was spotted *wandering* alone in @entity8 **'s** @entity44
photographer @entity9 tracked the beast for two years and says it **'s** never been part of a herd
some experts say zebra developed stripes over time like human fingerprints to help them recognise each other
others say it is to fend off blood - sucking flies or to confuse predators
