@entity1 motor company @entity0 has teased the launch of a new three - wheeled vehicle to the public			1
dubbed the @entity5 , it looks to be a blend of a motorcycle and car and is not too dissimilar to the @entity9 from @entity12 's @entity11 trilogy			1
@entity13 will be revealed in full on 27 july , but experts have already pored over details to find out as much as possible about the hotly anticipated vehicle			1
the three - wheeled @entity5 ( patent drawing shown ) looks to be a blend of motorcycle and car - it has no doors , an open top and a windshield that looks like a bike visor two teaser video have been released so far , with a third scheduled for 14 july			1
name : @entity5 price : under $ 30,000 release : 2016 engine : 2.4 - litre ecotec four - cylinder engine horsepower : 200 to 250 bhp top speed : 130 miles ( 210 kilometres ) features : abs brakes , power steering , traction control and stability control steering : front wheel drive seats : two doors : none in them , some of the finer details of the vehicle can be spotted			1
the first and most obvious observation is that the vehicle sports three wheels , rather than two for a motorcycle of four for a car			0
the reason for this could be so that the vehicle can be classified as a motorcycle , superseding some stringent safety checks needed for cars			0
the slingshot is also devoid of doors , while it sports a windshield similar to the plastic on motorcycle helmet visors			0
it ’s also incredibly low to the ground , with one scene from the videos showing just a tiny gap between the driver ’s seat and the road			0
‘ this thing is going to have the seat of your pants getting warm from the asphalt passing under you at a high rate of speed , ’ said @entity76 on @entity77			0
in this still from one of the teaser videos the interior of the car can be seen			2
the two seats , which admittedly do n't look all that comfortable , are also very close to the ground so riders ' surf ' the road			1
the slingshot it can apparently reach speeds of 130 miles ( 210 kilometres ) per hour look familiar ? you 'd be forgiven for the three wheels of the @entity5 reminding you of a @entity99 ( left ) , while the aesthetic look of the vehicle also seems to bear a striking resemblance to the @entity9 from the @entity104 trilogy of movies , pictured right in @entity107 's @entity106 other rumours suggest @entity0 will be gearing up to sell the @entity5 beginning in 2016 , although exact dates are not known			1
a rumoured price tag is less than £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) but , again , that is just speculation for now			2
what is more concrete is what will be powering the vehicle ; most think it will sport a 2.4 - litre @entity118 four - cylinder @entity120 engine			0
estimates for the horsepower range from 200 to 250 brakehorsepower , while its top speed has been estimated at 130 miles ( 210 kilometres ) per hour			0
is this the car in the flesh ? this image was snapped by a user on @entity77 and apparently shows the car being made by @entity0 in a car park			2
the company has released two teaser videos , while the full reveal is on 27 july			1
rumours suggest it will launch in 2016 and will cost under £ 17,500 ( $ 30,000 ) two teaser video have been released so far , with a third scheduled for 14 july , while a series of patent drawings have also been submitted to the @entity1 patent office ( shown )			1
in them some of the finer details of the vehicle can be spotted ; here can be seen the ' open ' design of its back wheel other features , some that could probably be considered standard these days , are abs brakes , power steering , traction control and stability control reports @entity155			0
but while the tyres look road - worthy the seats do n’t look incredibly comfortable , suggesting this might be more of a ‘ boy ’s toy ’ car than one driven for comfort			2
in the video the driver is also seen to be wearing gloves , further hinting that @entity0 will classify the slingshot as a motorcycle over a car			2
for all the final details , though , motorheads will have to keep their eyes and ears peeled when @entity0 unveil the vehicle on 27 july			1
the slingshot is also devoid of doors , while it sports a windshield not too dissimilar to the plastic on motorcycle helmet visors			0
it 's also incredibly low to the ground , with one scene from the videos showing just a tiny gap between the driver 's seat and the road other features , some that could probably be considered standard these days , are abs brakes , power steering , traction control and stability control reports @entity155			0
