revolution : tech brands have overtaken more established firms in the @entity17 table of the most valuable brands , as this graph shows @entity2 , which has become an icon of globalisation and consumer society , has been top of the list every year since it was first published in 2000			1
but @entity1 's devotion to sleek design and @entity15 's almost universal popularity as the world 's top search engine helped them surpass the 127 - year - old drink for the first time			0
despite the death of @entity1 's visionary founder @entity41 in 2011 , the firm 's brand value has continued to rise , according to @entity17 , soaring 28 per cent in a year to reach $ 98.3billion			2
@entity15 's brand is worth $ 93.3billion - up 34 per cent on last year - with @entity2 worth $ 79.2billion			1

paying tribute to @entity1 's sucess , @entity17 ceo @entity70 said : ' every so often , a company changes our lives - not just with its products , but with its ethos			0
this is why , following @entity2 â€™s 13 - year run at the top of @entity81 , @entity1 now ranks # 1			2
' not only does @entity1 have the world 's best brand , it is also the most valuable company in the @entity86 , with a market capitalisation of more than $ 400billion			1
decline : @entity2 has been knocked from its perch as the most valuable company in the world after 13 years classic : @entity2 has long been an icon of globalisation and @entity86 consumer culture @entity95 's , another firm considered to be an icon of @entity86 consumer culture , came in seventh on this year 's list			1
