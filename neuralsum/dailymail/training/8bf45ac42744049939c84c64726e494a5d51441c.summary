by @entity1 reporter published : 05:15 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 8 april 2013 it is the world 's most remote group of islands , 6,173 miles from @entity5 , and has more birds and penguins than human residents			1
but there is one thing missing from the lives of the @entity13 islanders - it can not find a vicar to give them spiritual guidance			2
the volcanic @entity5 territory in the @entity18 has been without a parish priest since father @entity20 left in 2010			1
rugged : the island of @entity13 which is still looking for a parish priest for the 262 inhabitants almost three years after the last vicar left advert : the vacant position for a parish priest is displayed on the @entity13 website with skills the ideal candidate should have the post has been advertised several times , according to the @entity33 , but so far no one has agreed to make their home 1,750 miles from the nearest landmass of @entity38			1
now the residents , who number 262 , could have a woman as their next priest as the @entity43 diocese steps up its attempts to fill the vacancy			1
@entity46 , who was born on the island , is training in @entity48 to be a priest and is helping the search			2
she is and is due to be ordained this summer before serving a curacy in @entity52			0
@entity54 population : northern @entity55 on the nearby @entity56 ms @entity46 , the descendant of @entity59 @entity58 , who was shipwrecked on the island in 1892 , hopes to return to live on @entity13 ' one day ' , the @entity57 on sunday reported , she described the island as a ' very special ' place in which to serve , adding : ' if you are looking for a ministry where you want to be close to @entity65 and close to nature , then @entity13 is the place for you			1
locator : the tiny speck on the map of @entity13 and the distance to @entity5 ' there is something about being in the middle of the @entity18 , reliant on a community of people with whom you live			1
you hear the sound of @entity65 's voice much more clearly			1
' according to @entity13 's website , the new vicar of @entity82 's will ideally play a musical instrument and teach at the school			2
the advert said : ' applicants should be active and energetic			0
a keen interest in church music and the ability to play an instrument would be an asset			0
' @entity13 is a close - knit community with just seven surnames among its inhabitants , but some of its priests have found life depressing and lonely there			0
the reverend @entity99 , younger brother of writer @entity100 , grew so unhappy at the ' unnatural state of isolation ' he told of his despair four years after arriving as a teacher and missionary in 1880			2
he wrote : ' it has been my daily prayer that @entity65 would open up some way for us all to leave ... there is not the slightest reason for this island to be inhabited at all			1
' there was a 13 - year time lapse between a vicar 's appointment when the @entity116 quit the island in 1909			2
the archipelago , first sighted in 1506 , consists of the main island of @entity13 itself , which measures about seven miles across			0
it has an area of 37.8 sq miles , along with the uninhabited @entity123 and the wildlife reserves of @entity125 and @entity56			0
there is no airport and only nine ships are scheduled to visit from @entity43 , the nearest major port			0
@entity129 arrived only in 2001 , but there are only two terrestrial channels			0
during @entity133 , it was used as a listening post to monitor @entity136 ships while the entire population was evacuated from 1961 - 63 over a threatened volcano eruption .			0

volcanic @entity5 territory has been without a priest for three years
