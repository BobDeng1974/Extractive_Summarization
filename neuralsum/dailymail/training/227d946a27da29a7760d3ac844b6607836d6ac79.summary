to say that @entity0 and @entity1 are teams moving in the opposite direction can not be denied ... especially from a platform at @entity4			1
the two @entity6 sides passed each other on the concourse with champions @entity0 boarding the train to @entity10 for their match with @entity12 while relegation candidates @entity1 alighted to prepare for their meeting with @entity15			1
players including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 smiled as they walked past each other in regimented lines not far removed from their usual pre-match ritual			0
@entity0 players arrive at the train station just as @entity1 players are leaving managers @entity27 ( @entity28 ) and @entity29 ( @entity30 ) found the funny side of the situation @entity34 @entity33 ( @entity28 ) , @entity35 ( @entity30 ) and @entity36 ( @entity37 ) have a chat @entity0 were travelling to @entity10 for a meeting with @entity12 while @entity1 arrived in @entity4 to face @entity15 the players passed each other in lines that resembled a pre-match ritual at a @entity6 match managers @entity29 and @entity27 laughed at the situation while @entity34 @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 found time for a chat			1
@entity0 have headed south without their captain @entity48 - who has been ruled out after picking up a calf injury in wednesday night 's @entity51 defeat against @entity52			1
the @entity53 joins @entity54 and @entity55 on the treatment table as @entity0 try to bounce back from their @entity58 embarrassment - giving a rare chance for Â£ 32million summer signing @entity59			2
@entity48 will miss the match at @entity61 after picking up a calf injury in the @entity51 @entity63 is expected to captain the @entity6 champions in the @entity53 's absence either @entity63 or @entity67 will captain the team at @entity61 in @entity48 's absence			2
meanwhile , @entity29 believes @entity70 will play a major role in turning @entity15 back into a title - winning force			2
' i think he 's been a mainstay in @entity15 and he will be instrumental in them getting right back to the top in the next two or three years , ' @entity29 said of the @entity78 captain - who is set to win his 100th cap next week			0
@entity1 boss @entity29 has decided to stop complaining about referee 's decisions this season @entity1 have been left perilously close to the relegation zone following their previous loss to @entity85 ' i know he 's on a lot of money and so he 's open to criticism but , just the way he is , the fans love him and he comes back in and plays in midfield and he 'll pop out wide and up front and he just wants to play			0
' i think @entity70 would play anywhere you want , he 's such a good player			0
i always used to say about him when he first got started , i could just see him taking his shirt and shoes off and putting goalposts down in the park - he 's that kind of player and his enthusiasm			0
