offense : @entity3 as @entity20 was initially met with outrage by @entity0 ' with the release of this film , the number of visas issued by @entity0 grew tenfold			1
' it took six years for the a top @entity0 official to admit anything other than disgust at the portrayal of his country in @entity20 : @entity34 of @entity35			2
earlier the movie was banned in @entity0 , and tensions were inflamed when the @entity38 of @entity39 accidentally played @entity20 ’s spoof @entity0 national anthem during an awards ceremony for shooting medals in @entity43			2

the rest of her shooting team , for who she has just won the gold medal for , were less than impressed however , and demanded the ceremony be re-run as well as a full apology made			0
