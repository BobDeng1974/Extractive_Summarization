by @entity0 four men have been arrested after police swooped on an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout @entity5			1
officers found 800 blank credit cards , a card encoder and a laptop computer when they arrested four men at a motel at @entity11 , west of @entity5 , last week			1
the cards had the potential to fraudulently obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash , products and services			1
police seized a card encoder last week in an alleged credit card skimming syndicate targeting taxi customers throughout @entity5 a unit in @entity22 , @entity5 , was also raided and police seized two computers , mobile phones , and financial and identification documents			1

' i checked my account recently and discovered that $ 2000 had been withdrawn two days earlier from an atm in a suburb i 'd never been to and another $ 2000 transaction had been made the following day in the city			0
my card was still in my wallet and i 'm careful to cover my hand when i enter my pin at @entity38 's , so i had no idea who had taken the money and how they had done it			0
feeling sick i called my bank to report the unauthorised transactions and was asked whether i had used the @entity53 facility in a taxi cab recently and whether the driver had complained that his machine was n't working before trying a different machine			0
be wary of cab drivers using two different machines to swipe your card that had happened to me a few weeks earlier and as the bank explained is a very common method used to skim cards and pin numbers			2
i was warned to only ever use my credit card in a cab , before the bank quickly refunded the missing funds - including both the atm fees ! ' - @entity71 the skimmed information was allegedly then used to manufacture fraudulent credit cards , which were used to make @entity38 withdrawals and purchases			1
the acting commander of the @entity78 and @entity79 , detective acting superintendent @entity76 said ' people need to be alert every time they use their credit or debit card '			2
he went on to warn that ' it does n’t matter whether you ’re withdrawing money at an @entity38 , paying for a meal at a restaurant or settling a fare in a taxi , never let your card out of your sight			0
' ' some skimming devices look exactly like legitimate payment terminals , allowing criminals to skim a card ’s details right under the cardholder ’s nose			0
