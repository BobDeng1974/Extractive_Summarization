by @entity0 for @entity1 they 're as classically @entity3 as black cabs or fish and chips			1
now , nostalgic @entity3 can explore a historic exhibition dedicated to the iconic telephone phone boxes			1
it 's almost 100 years since the first public phone box was opened in @entity11 and the @entity13 museum in @entity14 , @entity15 , has assembled a collection of every model of phone box to have graced the @entity3 streets over the past 94 years			1
despite being on the streets since 1920 , phone boxes took some getting used to as there were fears you could catch tuberculosis from a shared handset			1
it was only in the late 1920s that the government confirmed they were safe to use			0
today , there are still 10,000 modern phone boxes functioning in the @entity3			1
the @entity30 ( left ) was @entity32 's first national kiosk in 1920 but it was installed more in rural locations than cities			1
in 1926 the @entity35 introduced the @entity36 ( right )			0
at this time , telephone boxes were still a novelty and the ' @entity40 ' sign helped educate people that the kiosk could be used any time of the day or night the @entity36 ( left ) was @entity32 's first @entity44			2
it was designed by @entity3 architect sir @entity45 , in 1926 and over the next nine years some 1,700 examples were installed , mostly in @entity11			1
just over 200 examples remain on @entity3 streets and these are given @entity50 listing status by @entity51			2
the @entity52 ( right ) was introduced in 1929			0
it was intended for use nationwide , whereas the @entity55 was limited to @entity11 due its cost and size the @entity58 ( left ) was designed by the @entity59 of the @entity35 and introduced in 1930			1
it used the successful design of the @entity36 , by sir @entity45 , expanded to include a post box and stamp machine			2
the @entity64 ( right ) never entered full - scale production			0
only a small number of sample k5 kiosks were manufactured , and no trace of these kiosks remains - pictured is a modern mock up the @entity71 ( left ) was a revolutionary design and equally radical in the use of materials , compared to earlier kiosks			2
the @entity35 wanted a modern kiosk to replace the @entity44 and considered designs by three of @entity32 's leading post war designers			2
the @entity71 was produced in prototype form only and ( pictured above ) is a surviving example			0
pictured right is the @entity82 that was introduced @entity83 , that was formed following the break - up of the @entity35 to form the @entity35 and @entity3 telecommunications the inside of the old boxes are almost unrecognisable from the aluminium modern phoneboxes - with all models featuring a cigarette rest and a shelf to store telephone directories - with some even adorned with carpets and flowers by the local communities from the early 1910s to the 1950s an estimated 500 examples were installed by the @entity97			1
the club installed a number of different types , with the @entity102 sentry box ( left ) being one of the earliest rac designs			2
pictured right is the updated design that had a flat roof , rather than pitched one the ' @entity107 ' sentry box ( left ) would have been a welcome sight for their patrolmen , offering shelter from bad weather while on the lookout for troubled motorists			2
the @entity107 , usually referred to as the @entity107 , began the introduction of a network of sentry boxes in 1912 and and by 1968 around 1,000 examples were installed			0
pictured right is the @entity118 was made famous by the @entity120 science - fiction series ' @entity121 ' , which first appeared on @entity3 television in 1963 the @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity44 were designed by sir @entity45			1
he was born on 9 november 1880 and came from a famous family of architects			0
sir @entity45 produced iconic designs in @entity32 including those for @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
his design for @entity129 was submitted in 1903 , when he was just twenty - two years old			0
knighted by @entity133 on 22 july 1924 , he died on 8 february 1960			0
@entity134 was a highly visible colour			0
the @entity35 's pillar boxes were already painted red so the choice of colour was an obvious decision			0
originally @entity45 had intended his kiosks to be painted silver , with a ' greeny - blue ' interior ; but for the internal workings of the @entity32 might never have had a @entity44			0
actor @entity144 poses with the @entity145 during a world tour to promote the new series of @entity121 in @entity148 this year the @entity118 was made famous by the @entity120 science - fiction series ' @entity121 ' , which first appeared on @entity3 television in 1963			1
the @entity151 - the doctor - travelled through time and space in a @entity145			0
in the series , the @entity145 was meant to adapt and blend into its surroundings , but a fault left it frozen in the form of a @entity118			1
through the fifty years of the television series , the @entity118 has become internationally recognised , yet only around 1,000 examples were installed			1
the blue police boxes were once commonplace on @entity3 streets , but now just a handful remain - mostly in @entity166			1
for short periods of time , the boxes were even used to lock up criminals .			0

@entity173 museum in @entity14 , @entity15 , has got a collection of every model of @entity3 phone box
the first public phone box opened in @entity11 in 1920 and there are only 10,000 modern phone boxes left in the @entity3
the exhibition includes famous boxes such as the @entity118 , made famous by the @entity120 series ' @entity121 '
