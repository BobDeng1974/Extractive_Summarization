captain @entity0 says @entity1 will leave @entity2 with ' a bit of a downer on ' after failing to force victory in the first test against the @entity7			1
the tourists , chasing a first away win since beating @entity10 in december 2012 , were halted by a stubbornly unresponsive pitch at the sir @entity12 , as well as a name - making century from all - rounder @entity15			1
in the end they could only muster five of the eight wickets they needed on day five as @entity15 's unbeaten 103 steered the hosts to 350 for seven			1
@entity0 holds his head in his hands after the chance to take a crucial wicket goes begging in @entity2 @entity0 stands next to @entity7 captain @entity24 as both sides settled for a draw in the first test @entity0 did everything in his power to force the issue , rotating his bowlers , tinkering with fields and leaving close catchers in place from first ball to last			1
but in the end he was deflated , with just three days before the second test in @entity38			1
' i think the whole dressing room has a bit of a downer on because we left everything on the pitch , as we had to do , ' he said			0
' i would n't swap much of what we did on a pretty docile wicket , but credit to @entity15 because he soaked up a bit of pressure			2
' i think you could start another test match again on that wicket and it would last another five days			2
it did n't deteriorate at all but we came close to winning a test match on it			0
@entity15 hits a shot past cook on his way to his maiden @entity60 century that earned his side a deserved draw ' we threw everything at the @entity7 , we played a pretty good test match and came up just a little short			1
' it was probably a points victory but we go to @entity38 now			2
' @entity1 are unlikely to get much more assistance from the deck in @entity68 's , though it could be more receptive to turn			2
that brings @entity70 into the equation , with the off - spinning all - rounder passed fit after an abdominal injury and linking up with the squad in @entity38			2
@entity1 will also be wary about over-burdening their seam bowlers in back to back @entity60 , but @entity0 was not ready to speculate on possible personnel changes			1
' it 's very tough to say without seeing @entity38 and the wicket , but @entity81 is flying out and we 'll see how he is , ' said @entity0			1
@entity84 drives a shot past @entity0 on his way to 65 runs in a patient 175 - ball second innings ' obviously when you do 130 overs in the dirt you need to see how the guys pull up			0
' @entity1 's task now is find a way to bowl their opponents out twice on flat @entity99 surfaces , a question that was already occupying @entity101 on the day he became the country 's leading @entity60 wicket - taker			1
' for a fifth day pitch i 've not seen many flatter			0
you expect a bit of deterioration but there was nothing , ' said the seamer			0
' i imagine that 's what we 'll get for the next two games too so we have to go away and think about ways to get 20 wickets in the next two games			0
' for all @entity1 's frustration , the @entity7 will view the result as a morale boost			0
captain @entity24 added : ' we have n't lost to @entity1 in @entity2 before so it was nice to keep up that tradition			0
' the draw will feel good , confidence is up and some of our batters have got good starts			0
' so we regroup , come again and take it all to the next game			0
' the @entity1 players leave the field frustrated after day five ends with @entity7 having forced the draw			1
