by @entity0 a @entity2 senator has come out in favor of what he calls ' chicken boxing ' , a less bloody form of cockfighting , by opposing a bill that would close loopholes in the poultry fighting business and shut down the sport			1
@entity12 senator @entity12 of @entity13 says the bill threatens the ' legitimate , less bloody sport of ' chicken boxing ' , a suggestion that baffled @entity18 judiciary committee members and @entity20 senator @entity19 , who proposed the bill			1
the bill would tighten the state 's cockfighting ban , bringing it up to date with state laws that prohibit dog fighting , by broadening the definition of ' chicken ' in the current law to include roosters , game fowl and other birds			2
senator @entity12 claims chicken boxing is a legal sport - which uses some of the equipment used in cockfighting - but differs because matches are not fought to the death			1
senator @entity12 described chicken boxing as similar to human kickboxing , with chickens wearing little rubber ' gloves ' , instead of sharp spurs , on their legs			1
according to his description , the chickens face off in rounds of ten minutes each , and there is little chance of serious injury to the animals as veterinarians monitor each fight			0
senator @entity12 said : ' instead of a blade or exposed spur , they hit each other with these boxing gloves on , which is quite safe			1
' there 's no blood			0
' @entity12 senator @entity12 ( left ) of @entity13 says that the bill threatens the ' legitimate , less bloody sport of ' chicken boxing ' , while his opponent , @entity89 senator @entity19 ( right ) , said he has never heard of the ' sport ' senator @entity19 said he was unable to comment because he had never heard of the sport			1
he said : ' i have no knowledge whatsoever of chicken boxing so i can not speak to that , i have never heard of that			2
' it sounds like something to circumvent cockfighting			2
' senator @entity12 responded by saying : ' there is a legitimate sport known as chicken boxing			1
' it has nothing to do with cockfighting , and it is clear that this bill would interfere , and would criminalize that legal enterprise			2
' however , according to @entity112 , two chickens fighting each other in an arena is already banned under a 2008 @entity2 law that criminalized cockfighting			0
cockfighting involves the pitting of two roosters or other game fowl against each other in a ring , with spurs or sharp knives attached to their feet			0
new @entity2 legislation would tighten up restrictions on the blood sport senator @entity12 of @entity13 believes that stricter rules on cockfighting would make the ' legitimate sport of chicken boxing ' illegal the ' sport ' of cockfighting is largely known as a very brutal activity that serves as a way to facilitate gambling director of animal cruelty policy for the @entity137 , @entity138 , said there was no such sport as chicken boxing			1
he said : ' chicken boxing is just a creative excuse the cockfighters have come up with to mask their real agenda , which is to maintain the weakest penalties for cockfighting possible			2
' cockfighting is a rural tradition in which specially bred roosters , often outfitted with spurs , gaffs or knives , fight to the death while spectators place bets on the outcome of the match			0
for years , lawmakers resisted animal rights activists ' efforts to outlaw it , but eventually gave up in 2007 , and the ban took effect a year later making @entity2 the last state to make the rooster fights illegal			0
senator @entity12 said : ' my concern is about the breadth of this bill			1
' it covers all chickens			0
i represent a rural area where people raise a lot of chickens , including chickens that are 15th - and 20th - generation fighting birds that are exported legally and legitimately to other nations			0
' @entity19 said it was illegal to raise chickens for fighting			0
' these are not fighting chickens , ' @entity12 replied			0
senator @entity12 intends to carry the fight into the full senate , as the judiciary committee voted 4 - 2 to advance senator @entity19 's proposal .			1
