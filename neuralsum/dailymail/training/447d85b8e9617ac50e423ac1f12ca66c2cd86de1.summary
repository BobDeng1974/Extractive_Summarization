@entity3 mayor @entity2 's official vehicles were spotted breaking several traffic laws on thursday , just two days after he laid out a sweeping traffic safety plan that included harsh restrictions on reckless drivers			1
@entity8 was in the front passenger seat of the lead suv of a two - vehicle caravan that was captured on video speeding , running through a pair of stop signs and not signaling when changing lanes			1
the footage , which aired on @entity17 , was taken as @entity2 returned to @entity18 after a news conference in @entity20			2
the mayor 's press office deferred to the police department for particulars of the incident because a member of the @entity27 was behind the wheel of @entity2 's suv			1
' ' with that in mind , mayor de @entity2 is firmly committed to the traffic safety policies outlined this week , ' @entity42 said in a statement that did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing			1
the @entity27 did not address the specifics of thursday 's incident in a statement , but said members of the security detail ' receive specialized training in driving based on maintaining security as well as safety			2
' the statement spoke broadly about acceptable tactics used to keep vehicles together and said the handling of vehicles transporting any ' protectee ' is determined by police personnel based on ' protection and professional judgment			0
' the footage shows @entity2 's vehicles starting their journey in a quiet residential stretch of @entity71 , where they mayor had just held a news conference discussing his administration 's plans to combat potholes			1
the two bulky , black vehicles did not stop at two stop signs in the neighborhood			1
later , the @entity83 camera â€” which was in a car that followed the mayor 's motorcade - showed @entity2 going 40 mph in an area where the speed limit was 30 mph , and then nearly 60 mph in a 45 mph zone			1
need for speed : the cars were spotted doing 60mph in a 45mph zone ignored signs : the two cars breezed straight through stop signs full of holes : @entity8 filled in some potholes after giving a speech in @entity100 about road safety the @entity102 were also shown changing lanes without using their directional signals			1
the total number of violations witnessed by the news crew would yield a suspended license , according to the @entity83 report			0
it was not clear from the footage if @entity2 was aware of the traffic infractions			2
the mayor 's cars are typically driven by members of @entity2 's security detail , which is made up of @entity27 detectives			1
security protocols suggest that @entity2 sit in the backseat because the suv 's side windows , unlike the front windshield , are comprised of bulletproof - glass			1
but @entity2 , who is 6 - foot - 5 , frequently sits in the front , where he has more room to stretch out			2
just two days earlier , @entity2 released his ' @entity127 ' traffic safety plan which aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities			1
the plan proposed reducing the citywide speed limit to 25 mph , detailing more @entity27 officers to enforce speeding violations and toughening penalties for on speeding drivers			2
' we hope that every time someone reads one of your stories , they 're also asking themselves the question , are they handling their vehicle as responsibly as they could ? ' the mayor told reporters at the tuesday press conference			0
' the likelihood of a fatal crash and this statistic is very powerful , ' he also said at the traffic event			0
' the likelihood of a fatal crash drops significantly for speeds below 30 mph			0
if we get those speeds down , it will be the difference between losing a life and saving a life			0
' @entity156 , communications manager for the transit advocacy group @entity158 , said in a statement that ' no driver is above traffic law			0
' second time : the cars drive through stop signs without stopping , again switching lanes : the footage shows the cars changing lanes without indicating ' we look forward to other city officials leading by example as well , ' said @entity156 , who suggested that it could be a teaching moment for all drivers			1
the incident also comes just more than a week after @entity2 drew criticism for calling the @entity27 about the arrest of a political ally			2
bishop @entity177 was pulled over for a traffic violation and then arrested on an outstanding warrant stemming from an immigration rally last year			0
the bishop was later released on a desk appearance ticket instead of spending a night in jail			0
@entity8 said he did not ask for his release and denied any improper behavior , saying he was just asking for information about the incident			0
@entity8 is not the first mayor whose official vehicles were caught speeding			0
in 1998 , @entity189 observed @entity191 's car going more than 20 mph over the speed limit while driving on @entity193			0
@entity191 denied that he broke the law .			0
