a big debate researchers have been having about how small life on @entity2 can get may be over			1
scientists from the @entity4 @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 , captured photos of ' ultra-small bacteria ' for the first time			1
the photos may end a debate which has been raging for two decades.about whether the tiny bacteria exist or not			0
scientists from the @entity4 @entity6 's @entity5 and the @entity7 , captured photos of ' ultra-small bacteria ' ( pictured ) scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell the comprehensive electron microscopy images and @entity22 - based description of the microbes researchers were able to obtain seem to indicate the bacteria are very small - but very real			1
ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns [ one micron is one millionth of a meter ] , according to @entity5 close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell			1
more than 150,000 @entity30 cells could fit onto the tip of a single human hair			0
the bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common			1
in their abstract , the scientists wrote : ' ultrastructural features potentially related to cell and genome size minimization include tightly packed spirals inferred to be dna , few densely packed ribosomes and a variety of pili - like structures that might enable inter-organism interactions that compensate for biosynthetic capacities inferred to be missing from genomic data			2
' the results suggest that extremely small cell size is associated with these relatively common , yet little known organisms			2
' since it was founded in 1931 , @entity5 ( pictured above ) has been recognized with 13 @entity50 prizes findings about the bacteria were published in the @entity54 journal			2
a @entity7 professor in the departments of @entity2 and @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity59 , co-wrote the paper with @entity61 , a reearchers at the @entity63			1
@entity59 said : ' these newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about			0
' these bacteria are detected in many environments and they probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems			0
' but we do n't yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do			0
' @entity61 said their research was ' a significant step in characterizing the size , shape , and internal structure of ultra-small cells '			0
she added : ' there is n't a consensus over how small a free - living organism can be , and what the space optimization strategies may be for a cell at the lower size limit for life			2
' since it was founded in 1931 , @entity5 has been recognized with 13 @entity50 prizes .			0

@entity5 and @entity7 , @entity7 , scientists have taken pictures of ' ultra small bacteria '
the researchers believe the bacteria are the smallest form of life on @entity2
they were able to get a dna - based description of the microbes
bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be *fairly* common
