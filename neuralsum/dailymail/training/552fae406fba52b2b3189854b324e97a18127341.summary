the great - grandmother lived with her parents and two brothers in the @entity17 suburb of @entity38 during @entity39 and times were tough for her family			1
so when ms @entity7 was given the book by her father @entity43 - a major during the war - she treasured it			1
@entity19 is a story book about two children who travel around @entity47 learning about their country			2
' we did n't have toys in the war years and to be presented with the lovely new book , that 's why it made such an impression on me , ' she said			0
in 1948 her family moved from @entity38 to @entity56 and the book got lost during the move			2
the gift inscription ms @entity7 ' father wrote to her when he gave her the book when she was 11 years old last month she was listening to the radio when she heard author @entity20 mentioned during a discussion about books			1
the name ' rang a bell ' so ms @entity7 asked her daughter to @entity68 the name and check if she was the author of @entity19			1
ms @entity14 found that this was correct but she told her mother she was mistaken , planning to track down a first edition copy and surprise her for @entity73			0
ms @entity14 found a number of copies at second - hand book shops around the world and on a whim she decided to contact the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity22 , because she had been a nurse at @entity81 in @entity17 for many years			2
in the book 's condition report it mentioned there was a gift inscription so she contacted the shop to ask for more details			0
ms @entity7 , 80 , and ms @entity14 , 48 , with the book @entity19 at the home they share in @entity15 , north - east of @entity17 three days later ms @entity91 received a reply telling her the inscription read : ' to @entity94 , from @entity95			1
ms @entity14 said when she got the email she felt like her heart had stopped			0
' i thought " @entity100 , it ’s @entity101 ’s book ! " ' she said			0

' i do n't expect anything less form the universe , ' she said			0
ms @entity7 as a child with her war veteran father @entity43 ( left ) and the book he gave her in 1944 ( right ) when she told her mother what she had found , ms @entity7 was shocked and amazed			1
' she had so many she could have tapped on to and just something made her do that , ' ms @entity7 said			2
they ordered the book and when it arrived last month and ms @entity7 unwrapped the parcel with her hands trembling and tears in her eyes			2
' i cried , naturally i cried for a long time			0

ms @entity7 wonders how the book ended up in @entity22 after 66 years and she said the book shop had not been able to give her any clues			1
ms @entity7 ' daughter found the book in a stroke of luck at @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity22 ' @entity132 did get in touch with these people to see if they could give us any idea about how they might be arrived by it , ' ms @entity7 said			1
' but they did n't show any interest in our interest			0
' the only thing we 've come up with is that during those days it was war years and there could have been @entity148 soldiers here and maybe they saw the book and took it home for their children			0
