cardinal @entity0 has resigned as archbishop of @entity2 's and @entity3 over the allegations			1
one of his accusers says the church would ' crush ' him , given the opportunity church leaders are debating whether to allow @entity11 ’s most senior @entity10 clergyman to take part in the vote to choose a new pope after he was accused of ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’ towards young priests 30 years ago			1
@entity18 officials last night admitted they were aware of the accusations against cardinal @entity20 and that the final decision was ‘ in the @entity23 ’s hands ’			1
@entity24 , head of the @entity10 in @entity25 and @entity11 ’s only representative at the election of the next @entity23 , missed a morning @entity28 in @entity3 at which he was due to celebrate the @entity23 ’s eight - year tenure			1
he denies all the allegations			0
it is understood the complaints by three serving priests and a former priest were reported to the @entity18 through the papal ambassador to @entity11 a week before the @entity23 ’s announcement that he was to step down			1
the complainants – all associated with the @entity38 and @entity3 – are said to have told @entity39 they want @entity24 to resign before next month ’s conclave to pick a new pontiff			0
the 74 - year - old , who is due to retire next month , will be the only @entity11 churchman eligible to vote			1
the former priest claims the cardinal made an inappropriate approach to him in 1980 after night prayers , when he was a seminarian at @entity49 in @entity49 , @entity50 , where the cardinal was spiritual director			1
the complainant , who is now married , is reported to have said he gave up the priesthood when @entity24 was first made a bishop			0
he said : ‘ i knew then he would always have power over me			0
it was assumed i left the priesthood to get married			0
i left to preserve my integrity			0
he said the proposal represents a ' grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right '			0
' same - sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child , ' he added			1
' it would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father			0
' he also opposed the introduction of civil partnerships , saying he believes that ' such relationships are harmful to the physical , mental and spiritual well - being of those involved '			2
after he was awarded the ' @entity88 ' award , @entity90 @entity25 director @entity89 said : ' in the past year the cardinal has likened the campaign for same - sex marriage to slavery , he has called it grotesque			1
' the second complainant is reported to have said he was living in a parish when he was visited by @entity24 , and ‘ inappropriate contact ’ took place			2
the third complainant is said to have alleged ‘ unwanted behaviour ’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after they shared a late - night drinking session			1
and the fourth reportedly claims the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact			1
@entity24 was supported yesterday by @entity109 , a former archbishop of westminster			2
@entity111 said : ‘ i was obviously very sad , but the cardinal has denied the allegations , so i think we will just have to see how that pans out			2
’ asked whether or not @entity24 should be able to take part in the selection of the new pope , he added : ‘ the allegations have not been proved so he will have to decide whether he wants to go			0
’ allegations against members of the @entity10 have dogged the papacy of @entity123 and some in the @entity18 believe the endless scandals prompted him to resign			0
whether or not @entity24 will be welcomed to the conclave is in the balance even though , according to canon law , no cardinal eligible to vote can technically be prevented from doing so			2
retiring : pope @entity123 delivers his blessing during his last @entity131 noon prayer from a window overlooking @entity133 at the @entity18 yesterday a youngster holds a banner during pope @entity123 's last @entity136			2
it reads : ' you are not alone , i am with you ' there was outcry last week when it emerged that the disgraced archbishop of @entity143 , @entity142 , would participate in the conclave , despite shielding accused priests from prosecution			1
the @entity23 told 150,000 pilgrims yesterday he is stepping aside because @entity148 told him to			0
at his last sunday appearance in the @entity18 ’s @entity133 pope @entity123 revealed @entity148 had called on him to devote himself to prayer and ‘ climb the mountain ’			0
@entity123 , who steps down on thursday , said he was ‘ not abandoning the church ’ but aims to serve with the same dedication ‘ in a way more suitable to my age and my strength ’			0

@entity0 , 74 , faces claims of inappropriate attention by four priests
one priest alleges ' unwanted behaviour ' after late - night drinking
another priest said he was 18 when ' inappropriately approached
@entity0 now faces demands for his immediate resignation
but a former archbishop says people ' must *listen* ' to the cardinal 's side
