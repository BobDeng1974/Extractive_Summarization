the address of a property belonging to @entity3 and @entity4 was found on a terror suspect , the @entity0 heard a terror suspect was caught carrying bombmaking instructions and @entity4 ’s address , a court was told yesterday			1
@entity10 , 26 , was arrested at gunpoint after a bug that police planted in his car recorded his rants against the @entity16			1
officers allegedly then found a micro memory card hidden in his @entity20 case with a step - by - step guide on making an improvised explosive device			1
the mobile , which had the black flag of jihadist group @entity25 as its home screen , had been used to visit extremist sites and monitor the war in @entity30			2
an @entity0 jury was told the handwritten address of mr @entity4 and his wife @entity3 was found in @entity10 ’s @entity35 glasses case			1
opening the prosecution ’s case yesterday , @entity36 said the law student was plotting a terrorist outrage			2
he said the target was unknown and may have been ‘ against a limited number of individuals , an individual of significance or a more wide ranging and indiscriminate attack ’			2
the @entity47 suggested the plan might have been to copy the carnage in 2008 in @entity50 when more than 150 people were killed by marauding gunmen			2
the @entity0 trial is being held in conditions of extreme secrecy with the vast majority of the evidence to be heard behind closed doors			1
the case would not have been reported at all had the media not persuaded a high court judge that complete secrecy was an affront to centuries of open justice			2
@entity10 and @entity66 , 26 , were arrested in a dramatic police swoop as they travelled through east @entity69 in a black 2010 - plate @entity70 last october 13			1
the court heard that counter terrorist police discovered identical memory cards wrapped in masking tape and concealed in the cases of their iphones			1
forensic experts discovered they were loaded with three files with innocent titles but which allegedly contained detailed bombmaking instructions			0
the material included a ‘ car bomb recognition guide ’ , details of a ‘ gas bomb ’ , information to help make detonators and a photograph of an exploding jet			0
one of the documents began with the advice : ‘ the first rule of bomb - making is your first mistake will be your last			2
’ the court heard that almost a fortnight earlier police had covertly photographed the contents of the @entity70 and installed a bug after stopping @entity10 for a traffic offence			1
mr @entity36 said the device recorded him referring to a ‘ plan b ’ because he feared the authorities were on to him			0
londoner @entity10 , 26 , centre , who is of @entity107 origin , is accused of terror charges but denies them watched : @entity10 on a quad bike ( left ) and @entity66 , 26 ( right ) who pleaded guilty last week the court was told he said : ‘ we might have to destroy everything and do something else , plan @entity112 ’ speaking to his wife , with whom he has three young children , he added : ‘ these pigs , i just feel like running them over			1
’ when she asked why he was calling the police ‘ pigs ’ , he replied : ‘ they are pigs , they are known as pigs			0
everyone , even the kuffar [ non-muslims ] call them pigs			0
’ in another conversation , he said : ‘ they made a big mistake there			0
there was some very important stuff in the car … if they found it … effed			2
’ police discovered @entity10 had access to a property other than his family home and found a laptop there , the court heard			1
it contained evidence of email and @entity151 conversations with an unknown figure overseas who used a woman ’s username			0
@entity10 was handcuffed and did not reply when told he was a suspected terrorist , the prosecutor said mr @entity36 said some of the ‘ cautious ’ deleted exchanges were recovered and contained coded references to a terrorist attack			1
in one , @entity10 referred to ‘ straps ’ , which the court was told is slang for guns			1
the other man replied : ‘ these straps are not the little ones			0
they are like the ones we have here			0
’ he then used a code word which police believe meant ‘ @entity170 ’			0
in a further exchange a code word for ‘ @entity50 - style ’ was also used , the jury was told			1
on his laptop , counter terrorism police found a prayer to mujahedeen fighters and those who create improvised explosive devices			0
@entity10 , formerly known as @entity180 and a @entity182 citizen of @entity107 origin , is accused of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing bombmaking instructions			1
he denies all the charges			2
@entity188 pleaded guilty to possessing bombmaking instructions last week and is not on trial			0
the trial is expected to last up to six weeks			0
@entity10 , pictured in court , had the black @entity194 flag as his @entity20 's wallpaper , jurors at the @entity0 heard dozens of terror trials have been staged at the @entity0 but few have involved the level of secrecy seen yesterday			1
the opening remarks by the prosecution were heard in public but the vast majority of the trial until the jury returns its verdict will be held behind closed doors			1
the evidence will be heard in three ways , in public ; with a small group of journalists who can not report what they hear ; and entirely in secret			2
the unusual arrangements are the result of a compromise struck after a successful @entity219 challenge by the media			0
several organisations , including this newspaper , objected to plans by the trial judge to hold the trial entirely in secret for reasons of national security			1
a panel of senior judges ruled that total secrecy would go against the principle of openness at the heart of the @entity182 criminal justice system			0
as a result , ten accredited journalists are allowed to witness some of the closed proceedings – but will not be able to report what they heard			0
they must also hand over their phones before every session , leave their notes in a locked safe and not discuss the case with outsiders			0
the journalists have been warned that breaching the order could lead to prosecution for contempt of court			0
