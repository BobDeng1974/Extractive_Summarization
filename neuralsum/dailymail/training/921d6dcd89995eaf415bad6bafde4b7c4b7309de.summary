@entity0 running back @entity1 ' pride and joy is n't a sports car , a hummer or a @entity6 - it 's a 1991 @entity7 , which until recently had no air - con and a large dent in the back right panel			1
the @entity12 star certainly makes enough money to afford a brand - new car , but @entity1 has no interest in other vehicles			1
' i did n’t grow up with a lot			0
this helps me remember where i come from and where i ’m going , ' he says			0
the @entity21 : @entity1 ' beloved 1991 @entity7 is back to her best after a refurb first love : @entity1 says he does n't see why he should buy a new car when his old one is still running since @entity1 is an @entity12 player on an @entity12 salary , the question must be asked : why the attachment to a small sedan that 's more than 20 years old ? @entity1 purchased the car from his pastor while he was a student at @entity34 for the sum of $ 2			1
and while he could be getting around in something a little more lavish , @entity1 only has eyes for his first love			2
' it ’s more than just a car , ' @entity1 , who started as a rookie with the @entity41 , team last year , told @entity44			1
refreshingly , @entity1 does n't have any desire to acquire status symbols , despite his success on - field			1
' i 'm loyal to my car , ' he said , explaining that he does n't feel the need to show off his money with expensive cars and clothing			2
' i love my car , and that 's what i 'm going to drive			2
i 'm a lot better off than i was but at the same time ... i feel like it 's a waste of money to go buy a new car if my car is running perfectly fine , you know ? i just do n't get that concept , ' he told @entity62			1
good as new : @entity1 will now enjoy air - conditioning in his @entity7 pro : @entity1 is running back for the @entity0 the car , which @entity1 refers to as ' the @entity21 , ' recently underwent a complete overhaul to keep it up and running for another 20 years			1
after hearing about @entity1 ' love for his car , @entity7 offered to refurbish the @entity21 , which had broken air - conditioning and was in need of some @entity71			1
@entity1 was separated from his car as it underwent a total of 275 man hours of labor and received more that 450 new parts			1
@entity7 sent him regular updates on the progress , although sometimes he found it all a little much			2
' i was like , " oh , wow			0
’ i did n’t know they were gon na go that deep , ' @entity1 told the @entity81			2
' it was weird seeing her like that			0
i was like , " no ! they took her apart ! " it hurt , just a little bit			0
' at the big reveal on tuesday at the @entity90 dealership , @entity1 was eager to see how his trusty car scrubbed up			1
' she has n’t changed , ' he told the @entity81			0
' i mean , she looks different , but it ’s still the same car			2
sometimes when something changes , you ’re like , " oh man , i want it the old way			0
" but when i sat in her , i still got that feeling			0
she ’s still the @entity21			2
' loyal : @entity1 has been driving the car since his college days when he bought it from his pastor for $ 2 the @entity21 looked as good as when she was first driven off the lot in 1991			1
on the outside , the car had been completely repainted and new headlights and taillights were installed			0
according to @entity44 , the car received new 626 emblems and @entity7 created some new exterior trim pieces using the original molds in @entity119			1
a dent on the back right side was panel - beaten out , despite some misgiving from @entity1			1
' the character , the dent that was in the back right side			0
i had the option to keep it , but then i called them and was like , " do n’t worry about it			0
" all the hard work that they put into it , i think it would have took away from it if it still had the dent in the side			0
so i was like , i wo n’t be selfish			0
i ’ll just keep the memory in my mind and said they could take it out			0
' @entity7 man : with help from the @entity7 team , @entity1 and his ride have many more years together to look forward to @entity7 technicians removed the powertrain , rebuilt the 2.2 - liter , 110 horsepower four - cylinder engine , installed new hoses , gaskets and rubber items , put in a new air conditioner , added new brakes front and rear , put on a new exhaust system , and even replaced the battery and alternator			1
' it ’s old school , like i am , ' @entity1 said at the reveal , according to @entity44			2
' i know i have n’t been around long , but i have an old spirit			0
' there are a few new - school features that @entity7 has added to the new and improved @entity21 , including @entity21 - style cross-stitched leather seats in homage to the car 's namesake , and a new dashboard and a seven - inch touchscreen @entity165 stereo with @entity167			1
' man , i got my baby back , and she looks better than ever , ' @entity1 said tuesday			1
' i just want to ride around and go nowhere in her			0
i ’ll bet she ’s been missing it			0

@entity1 , running back for the @entity0 , bought the 1991 @entity7 for $ 2
@entity1 refers to the car as ' the @entity21 ' and says as long as it 's running he wo n't part with it
