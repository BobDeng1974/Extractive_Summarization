by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:37 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 16:39 est , 14 may 2013 prosecutors in the @entity4 theater shootings have listed about 3,500 potential witnesses they could call during the trial of defendant @entity7			1
the estimate was in a motion filed tuesday			0
none of the witnesses have been publicly identified			0
lawyers also say nearly 40,000 pages of documents about evidence have been filed			0
@entity7 is accused of killing 12 and injuring 70 in the july 20 shooting at an @entity18 movie theater			1
he 's charged with multiple counts of murder and first - degree murder			0
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty			0
changing their stance : @entity7 , pictured during a march court hearing , has now entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity back in court : accused movie theater gunman @entity7 , is led into the courtroom in this sketch @entity33 : @entity7 ' mother @entity7 , left , is escorted by a member of the defense team as she arrives for monday 's court hearing @entity7 has asked to change his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity , but the judge has n't decided whether to accept it			1
the judge said that he finds ' good cause ' to allow the change in plea but will not make his decision until may 28 - three days before a new hearing begins			1
@entity7 had bushy hair and beard at his hearing on monday			2
he did n't speak at all and entered the courtroom with his eyes downcast			0
the not guilty by reason of insanity plea is widely seen as @entity7 ' best - and perhaps his only - hope of avoiding the death penalty			1
but his lawyers have held off until now , fearing a wrinkle in the law could cripple their ability to raise his mental health as a mitigating factor during the sentencing phase			0
two judges have refused to rule on the constitutionality of the law , saying the attorneys ' objections were hypothetical because @entity7 had not pleaded insanity			1
defense : attorney @entity69 made the request to change @entity72 ' plea to not guilt by reason of insanity in court monday judge : @entity78 district judge @entity77 will rule on the plea change on may 28 the defense had little choice but to have @entity7 enter the plea and then challenge the law			1
@entity7 ' lawyers announced last week that he would ask to change his plea at monday 's hearing			1
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against @entity7 , who faces more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder charges			2
they say @entity7 , a former neuroscience graduate student , spent months acquiring weapons and ammunition , scouting a theater in the @entity96 suburb of @entity18 and booby - trapping his apartment			2
then on july 20 , dressed in a police - style helmet and body armor , he opened fire during a packed midnight showing of the @entity104 film ' @entity105 , ' prosecutors say			1
twelve people were killed and another 70 were injured			0
arrest : much of his actions have hinted that an insanity plea might be in the cards , especially after his first court appearance where he seemed out of it no motive has emerged in nearly 10 months of hearings , but @entity7 ' attorneys have repeatedly said their client is mentally ill. he was being treated by a psychiatrist before the attack			1
the insanity plea carries risks for both sides			1
@entity7 will have to submit to a mental evaluation by state - employed doctors , and prosecutors could use the findings against him			2
' it 's literally a life - and - death situation with the government seeking to execute him and the government , the same government , evaluating him with regard to whether he was sane or insane at the time he was in that movie theater , ' said attorney @entity133 , a past president of the @entity134			1
among the risks for prosecutors : they must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity7 was sane			2
if they do n't , state law requires the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity			2
' that 's a significant burden on the prosecution , ' @entity133 said			0
if acquitted , @entity7 would be committed to the state mental hospital indefinitely			2
a judge entered a standard not guilty plea on @entity7 ' behalf in march , and he needs court permission to change it			1
@entity133 said it 's a foregone conclusion the judge will accept the new plea to preclude appeals later			2
the mental evaluation could take weeks or months			0
tragic : the shooting at the multiplex left 12 people dead and injured 70 in july 2012 evaluators will interview @entity7 , his friends and family , and if @entity7 permits it , they 'll also speak with mental health professionals who treated him in the past , said dr @entity164 , a professor of psychiatry and adjunct professor of law at @entity167			1
evaluators may give @entity7 standardized personality tests and compare his results to those of people with documented mental illness			0
they will also look for any physical brain problems			0
@entity164 estimates he has conducted around 200 mental evaluations of criminal defendants , including some death penalty cases			0
' all cases are tough , ' he said			0
meticulous planning , as in the scenario prosecutors laid out against @entity7 , does n't necessarily mean a defendant is sane , @entity164 said			0
@entity164 said he helped evaluate @entity183 , who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 2009 shooting death of @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity189 , where she was attending college			1
evidence showed @entity183 planned the shooting , @entity164 said , ' but he was delusional as hell			0
