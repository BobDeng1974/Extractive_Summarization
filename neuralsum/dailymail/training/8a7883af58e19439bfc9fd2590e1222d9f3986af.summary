@entity0 finally broke his @entity2 duck as @entity3 routed @entity4 , closing the gap on leaders @entity7 to just one point			1
although the @entity10 was delighted to end his eight - game goalless streak in the competition , it was strike partner @entity14 that took the plaudits , bagging the first and then playing in @entity0 for his goal			1
@entity19 was having a quiet game but had the final say with two late goals to add gloss to the scoreline , after @entity24 had nodded in the third , providing a sweet end to what had been a bitterly disappointing year for his club			1
they lost in the @entity40 final to @entity7 , they threw away @entity2 on the final day against @entity41 at the @entity31 , and were booted out of the @entity42 by @entity44 's side as well			1
then there were off - field problems , with @entity48 's contract controversy forcing the resignation of @entity50 and the tragic death of former coach @entity52			0
the start to life under @entity55 has been rocky , with a good start crumbling away after defeats in the @entity58 and then at home against @entity60			0
but slowly they are picking themselves up and dusting themselves down			0
this was the fourth home game in two weeks , and they have scored a total of 21 goals in that time			1
@entity0 hugs @entity14 enthusiastically , almost looking like he is nibbling him , after scoring his first @entity2 goal at the @entity31 on saturday the @entity71 striker performs his trademark celebration by kissing his wrist following his goal at the @entity31 on saturday @entity3 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity75 ; @entity76 , @entity24 , @entity77 , @entity78 ; @entity79 ( @entity80 65 ) , @entity81 , @entity82 ( @entity83 76 ) ; @entity14 , @entity19 , @entity0 subs not used : @entity85 , @entity48 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 goals : @entity14 ( 2 ) , @entity0 ( 53 ) , @entity24 ( 80 ) , @entity19 ( 82 , 90 ) booking : @entity91 @entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity92 ; @entity93 , @entity94 ( @entity95 60 ) , @entity96 , @entity97 ; @entity98 , @entity99 ( @entity100 72 ) ; @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 ( @entity104 76 ) , @entity105			1
subs not used : @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 in between , there was last weekend ’s weak performance away at @entity113 , when without @entity48 they lacked the skill and incision to destabilise the @entity7 minnows and suffered a goalless draw			2
the @entity118 had an ankle injury , which saw him left on the bench for this game , but he was not needed			0
@entity14 , who now has six goals in six games after netting only one in the previous 16 games , opened the scoring after just a minute			1
@entity79 played a crafty through ball towards the six - yard box and @entity14 took one touch to control it and another to ram it into the top right corner , with @entity92 helpless			2
the forward , always patient despite his reserve status at the club , turned provider for the second goal			0
@entity82 played the ball into the area and @entity14 took control , weighed up his options and rolled the ball back for @entity0 in the middle			2
since signing from @entity145 , he has fluffed his lines a few times in @entity2			2
he had a chance after 10 minutes when @entity149 charged up the left and cut it back , but @entity0 volleyed into the side netting			1
but receiving @entity14 ’s pass , he took his 17th shot of the league campaign , in his eighth appearance , and finally got the goal he cherished			2
from just a couple of yards out he prodded the ball through @entity92 ’ legs and turned the @entity31 into a cauldron of camera flashes			0
@entity79 , who has been in and out of the team since signing from @entity163 , nearly added a third two minutes later , cracking a fierce drive off the outside of the post			0
@entity14 celebrates after putting @entity3 ahead at the @entity31 less than two minutes into the game with @entity4 the @entity3 forward ( right ) shoots with both feet off the ground to put the home side ahead at the @entity31 @entity171 celebrates by running away and jumping in the air while trying to grab his boot on saturday @entity149 ( right ) of @entity3 runs across to @entity14 and jumps on him in celebration of the former 's goal @entity24 celebrates scoring @entity3 's third goal against @entity4 at the @entity31 on saturday @entity4 , who only had one win in their previous 15 @entity2 games , never looked like getting something here			1
the closest they came was a rambling break by @entity183 , who skinned @entity77 but then fired into the side netting of @entity75 ’s goal			0
while many thought @entity188 - ter @entity85 would be the replacement for @entity190 , the @entity186 has been faultless in his stead			0
there was more to come from @entity3 , even if the game had already been won			2
substitute @entity80 whipped in a free kick which @entity24 planted into the net with a firm header , before @entity19 smashed one home himself , despite putting in a subdued performance , overall			2
his second goal , right at the death , was even better			0
@entity19 pulled off a phenomenal , elastic piece of control to bring a cross in , swivelled and then fired home inside @entity92 ’ near post			0
@entity3 are now breathing down @entity7 ’s neck at @entity2 ’s summit , although @entity7 have a game in hand because of their @entity211 participation			1
there is still plenty for @entity55 to work on			0
he selected a 24th different line up in his 24th game in charge , which suggests he has worked out neither his best eleven nor the optimal system			0
but @entity3 can head into 2015 with the wind in their sails , given @entity0 has finally broken his duck in domestic competition and @entity14 looks close to rediscovering his form			1
the @entity225 centre back ( second right ) rises highest to power a header into the @entity4 goal and put @entity3 3 - 0 up @entity19 of @entity3 looks on during saturday 's match in @entity2 at the @entity31 @entity0 ( left ) of @entity3 advances with the ball as @entity4 's @entity94 tries to pull him back @entity4 defender @entity98 ( left ) and @entity3 's @entity79 ( right ) both compete for the ball at the @entity31 @entity14 ( left ) curls the ball around @entity4 goalkeeper @entity92 to give @entity3 an early lead at the @entity31 @entity3 players crowd around @entity14 after the @entity235 put them ahead less than two minutes into the match @entity81 ( left ) of @entity3 holds off the challenge of @entity4 's @entity101 @entity19 ( left ) waits for the ball to drop down from the air as @entity4 's @entity97 runs across to challenge him @entity24 ( left ) celebrates with team - mate @entity80 following @entity3 's third goal against @entity4 @entity19 fires in his team 's fourth of the afternoon at the @entity31 against @entity4 on saturday @entity19 celebrates with his team - mates @entity24 , @entity0 and @entity149 after scoring his side 's fifth against @entity4			1

@entity3 went ahead through @entity14 just one minute and *12* seconds into match at @entity31
@entity0 scored his first goal in @entity2 with a *scuffed* finish to *double* @entity3 's lead on saturday
@entity24 scored @entity3 's third goal with just 10 minutes remaining at the @entity31
