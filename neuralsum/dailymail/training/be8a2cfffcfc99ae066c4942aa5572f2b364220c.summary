by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 05:06 est , 23 november 2013 @entity1 , son of @entity2 , said his father had acquired the priceless works legally more works have been revealed from the £ 1billion stash of looted art which was found behind stacks of tins and rotting food in a @entity12 flat			1
@entity14 authorities released images today of valuable sketches and etchings by two of the early @entity20 's most prominent artists			2
jewish @entity21 was one of the leading lights of @entity14 impressionism , growing up in central @entity25 and becoming a highly - respected artist before his death in 1935			0
and @entity29 artist @entity28 , most famous for his iconic painting @entity31 , was highly favoured among @entity22 collectors in 1930s @entity14			2
both had works among the thousands which were declared ' degenerate art ' by the @entity37 and were unceremoniously strong - armed at knock - down prices from their @entity22 owners , only to fall into the hands of wealthy collectors after the war			1
now striking works by the pair , never shown before publicly , have been revealed from the 1,401 artworks found in the @entity12 flat of @entity1 - bringing the total so far seen publicly to 79			1
@entity2 , 80 , the son of dr @entity2 , was stopped by customs officials in 2010 on a train from @entity49 with 9,000 euros in cash and empty envelopes bearing the name of a @entity49 bank			1
the chance find led customs officials to his flat , where they stumbled across what is described as one of the greatest art discoveries of modern times			2
they kept the hoard secret and its existence became known only a month ago			0
@entity2 had been living a hermit 's life , it is said , existing outside the systems of modern society , dealing entirely in cash and selling works on the black market whenever he ran out			1

there are now 79 works listed on a website dedicated to the stash gems : the @entity82 revealed the works via the @entity84 , the government agency in charge of former hoards			1
pictured : people on a @entity89 by @entity21 icon : a self - portrait by @entity21 , left , and his work couple kissing at a desk and @entity94 , right two people by @entity28 , one of the new images of hoarded work to be revealed , depicts a couple in love @entity100 , by @entity28 , shows hallmarks of the bold , chunky style he used in his masterpiece @entity31 among the works revealed were two @entity28 woodcuts from 1930 , @entity106 ( left ) and @entity107 ( right ) man on horse in a busy street by @entity21 , the @entity22 @entity14 artist who died in 1935 , is on show @entity111 , by @entity28 , is one of the 79 works revealed so far			1
the artist was known for the deep psychological readings behind his works , depicting agonised mental states , and he suffered a breakdown himself some works were easier to date than others - woman at the sea by @entity21 carries key details in a rambling interview last month he said the works were rightly his - and they were all he had			0
' i will not give anything back voluntarily , ’ said mr @entity2			2
‘ i hope this gets resolved soon and i finally get my pictures back			0
' i ’ve never committed a crime , and even if i had , it would fall under the statute of limitations			0
if i were guilty , they would put me in prison			0
' he added : ‘ i just wanted to live with my paintings			0
' it is thought @entity14 authorities are unable to prosecute him for ownership of the works themselves , but they are investigating him over related allegations including of tax evasion			2
@entity2 , who suffers from a heart condition , said he had given state prosecutors investigating him ‘ enough ’ documents to prove his innocence			2
the new works have appeared on the official @entity154 website			0
others include works by @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
the works include @entity161 by @entity21 , a key figure in early 1900s @entity14 impressionism @entity164 at the @entity165 @entity21			0
if the works ' rightful owners can not be found they could be returned to @entity2 under @entity14 law , despite the manner in which they were taken from @entity22 owners people , by @entity21 , depicts an ambiguous scene which could be as much a courthouse as a pub the @entity176 , a lithograph print by @entity28 dating back to 1896			1
the works have been published online @entity179 , woman resting ( 1919 - 20 ) by @entity28 , and woman sitting with @entity182 by @entity21 , right			1
with artists of such stature any sketches have value , such as these on a sheet owned by @entity21 genius : @entity28 , pictured left in a self - portrait , is best - known for his four versions of @entity31 , right breathtaking : a montage of some of the works which have already been released by @entity14 authorities @entity2 's @entity12 flat was home to 1,406 paintings by such greats as @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 at least 500 of the pictures have been identifed as being bought at rock - bottom prices from @entity22 seeking to raise the necessary cash to buy exit visas from @entity203 ’s @entity14			1
but in the interview with @entity205 , @entity2 said he had nothing to do with acquiring the paintings and felt deeply attached to them , having never loved another human being			1
he told the newspaper : ‘ there are people who are still climbing mountains at 97 , but i wo n’t live to be that old			0
at least they could have waited until i was dead to take away the pictures			0
there is nothing i have loved more in my life than my pictures			0
' @entity203 declared a war on much modern art and culture , which he saw as hostile to @entity222 ideals , when he became @entity14 chancellor in 1933			0
books were burned and paintings like those belonging to @entity2 were confiscated or bought cheaply from @entity22 families , often as a bartering chip to allow them to flee the country			1
@entity2 's father @entity231 was just one of a handful of experts trusted by @entity203 to judge the qualities of what made a work of art degenerate			1
many of the works were exhibited publicly in @entity12 in 1937 so the @entity14 people could learn what their rulers were telling them not to like .			1
