sweet - natured honey the @entity24 won the @entity27 ' pet elfie ' competition			1
her owner @entity28 claimed the £ 250 voucher as well as a £ 250 charity donation to the dog rescue charity of her choice these two dogs do n't look all that happy to be dressed up as @entity35 and his lone reindeer the company was inundated with entries for their @entity35 competition including these two cute pooches , one of which wore a snowman outfit complete with top hat and carrot nose , while the other wore a @entity23 hat @entity49 offered a £ 250 gift voucher and a £ 250 charity donation for the best snaps and @entity17 's animal lovers entered in their droves			1
some took the @entity35 theme even further , dressing their animals up as @entity35 on his sleigh with a reindeer			0
the company say that they were inundated with entries but they eventually awarded the prize to adorable @entity24 , honey			1
her owner @entity28 said : ' honey loves lots of attention and fuss and is extremely placid			0
' as she is short - haired she wears a jumper when we take her for walks when it 's cold , so she does n't mind wearing elf outfits at all			0
' a festive @entity74 bull terrier wears an ' i believe in @entity23 ' bib , left , while a labrador wears a red hat this long - haired cat climbed into the sink it its @entity35 outfit , perhaps it was hoping to wash it off in the most accurate elf costume , this collie seems to have been collecting @entity35 baubles for its owner ' when i found out she had won i was over the moon to say the least			1
' my husband had an accident a couple of weeks ago , and now i will be able to take him for a relaxing weekend away with the prize			0

these two pals both have @entity35 outfits , while one wears reindeer ears the other has its @entity23 on while not as cute and cuddly as a dog or cat , buying a hat small enough for this lizard is a feat in itself she said : ' they do n't receive any financial support from councils or the government and work hard raising funds doing car boot sales and raffles to enable them to continue their fantastic work trying to re home dogs			2
