the crux of the matter with @entity2 is that you always want a little more			1
just imagine how good he might be if he tried harder , or broke into a sprint even , just now and then			2
those who formed the best working relationships with him , like @entity9 , seemed to get beyond that temptation and accept @entity2 was not like the others			1
perhaps he understood the enigma better than others or saw traces of the @entity16 in his game			2
@entity2 fashioned his game on @entity19 and there were flickers of @entity22 in his effortless control , vision and appreciation of the space around him			1
@entity2 ( right ) is back in @entity27 on wednesday night as @entity28 face @entity29 @entity2 ( here sauntering away from @entity32 's @entity31 in 2013 ) is known for his laid - back nature the @entity38 ( celebrating scoring against @entity35 in the 2008 @entity37 final ) had his best years at @entity39 ' in his style , he works hard , ' said @entity9 , who coached him at @entity39 and lured him to @entity41 , where he hailed this piece of business as ' @entity44 's biggest ever signing '			1
in a way it was			0
@entity2 arrived from @entity47 at the age of 31 , with plenty in the tank , certainly for someone who operates at strolling pace			1
no - one ever questioned his talent			2
a flash of his brilliance could brighten the dullest of games			0
questions about his application , however , were never far away , exaggerated by his demeanour			0
he rarely spoke but his body language screamed that he could n't care less			0
not good , especially for the captain of a struggling team			0
at @entity64 and @entity65 , the quality of those around him could carry him along on those quiet days , but at the @entity41 the team was misshapen , high on flair , low on graft and ultimately unable to shield their best player from criticism			0
@entity9 was sacked and @entity44 were heading for relegation when the @entity38 departed for @entity28 , bringing an end to his seven - and - a - half years in the @entity76 , with most people none the wiser about how good he had actually been			1
@entity9 was the manager to get the best out of @entity2 after signing the striker at @entity39 @entity2 modelled his game on @entity16 striker @entity19 ( pictured scoring for @entity81 in 1989 ) @entity2 is as casual on the pitch as he is off it ( pictured while at @entity47 back in 2012 ) there was certainly more to him than the miserable looking figure playing in tights , gloves and a roll - neck vest for protection from the wind whipping off the @entity91			1
there were trophies , two @entity76 titles and two @entity37 wins			1
he came on in the @entity97 final when @entity47 lost to @entity98 in 2009 , although sir @entity99 left him out of the squad two years later when they lost again to the same team			1
there were goals , lots of goals at a healthy rate			2
he scored five in a game for @entity47 against @entity109			0
there were fabulous volleys and crafty flicks , swerving free - kicks and ice - cool penalties , tap - ins and headers to prove there is deceptive strength in his wiry frame and the occasional overhead kick			2
then there were the tricks and flicks , a sneaky nutmeg , a disguised pass or an aerial back heel with a hint of @entity127 or @entity128			0
perhaps these are too quickly forgotten			0
the striker ( pictured winning a penalty against @entity132 in 2011 ) was impressive at @entity47 @entity44 under @entity9 signed @entity2 but he was never at his best during the spell at @entity41 if football is purely about entertainment , then @entity2 is a worthy prince but he would never become the new @entity128 at @entity47 as @entity99 hoped he might when he forked out Â£ 30million			1
there was the same brooding presence , physical gifts and technical craft but without the ability to influence the big games at the crucial moments			0
there was a time when there seemed a chance he might join @entity29 where he will appear on wednesday night			1
with six months left on his deal at @entity44 , @entity147 lost @entity149 to injury and the rumours started but he joined @entity28 instead , which seemed an appropriate fit in many ways			1
he has always fancied himself as something of a matinee idol with an elegance and idle swagger to suit @entity158			0
he often played as if there was a pastel - shaded jumper draped across his shoulders , tied loosely by the arms , which he really did n't want to fall in the mud			2
@entity2 netted 48 @entity76 goals for @entity47 in 108 starts under sir @entity99 for a thirty - something striker of mature years with no great desire to return to his native @entity38 , this seemed like a good place to wash up			1
' he is a really important player for us , ' said @entity28 's vice president @entity171			1
' his vision of the play and his technical ability is outstanding			0
and he likes @entity28 a lot			2
his team - mates like him			2
it is going well for him			0
it is good for us			0
' @entity2 's is the image on the posters pushing tickets for sunday 's game against @entity184 at the @entity185 he still has box office glamour for a club which has changed tack and allowed some of its big names to depart			1
he is also perhaps the closest thing @entity193 has to a reliable goal source with six in @entity195 , the top scorer in a team which has found the net 26 times this season			0
@entity28 , fourth in the @entity201 league , reached the last 16 of the @entity97 by winning their group with only four goals			1
last year , he scored six in 12 games after his move from @entity44			0
still he contributes and yet , still you want more .			0

@entity2 's @entity28 face @entity29 in the @entity97
the @entity38 enjoyed his time in the @entity76
