i ’ll never forget the day @entity1 made me jump 10 feet off my couch			1
it was a midweek afternoon and i was at home , winding down after training , when @entity1 called to tell me he had important news : i was going to be his @entity8 captain			1
it was an unbelievable feeling , a real ‘ punch the air ’ moment , and i ’m pretty sure @entity11 will get to experience the same emotions this week when my successor is revealed			1
as far as i am concerned , there is no more worthy candidate to take over			1
@entity1 has tremendous faith in @entity17			2
when the @entity24 striker was under pressure in the summer , when there was increased speculation about his place in the @entity8 team , his manager stuck by him and played him in the games that mattered			1
it was a big show of respect			0
on target : @entity8 forward @entity11 celebrates after scoring against @entity30 at the @entity31 chilling out : @entity11 ( left ) and @entity32 relax during an @entity8 training session in the @entity34 in may captain : @entity11 ( right ) leads out @entity24 for the pre-season friendly against @entity37 on august 12 red devil : @entity11 celebrates scoring for @entity24 against @entity39 in their @entity41 opener perhaps other managers would have taken him out of the firing line and put him on the bench when the scrutiny increased , but @entity1 knows what @entity47 brings to @entity8 ’s team and , just as crucially , what he will continue to contribute in the next few years			1
so why do i think @entity47 is the no 1 choice ? for starters , he is a natural leader			1
aside from being a top player , one who commands respect within the group , @entity47 is passionate about representing his country and wo n’t be fazed by the responsibility			2
before a game , he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room			1
he would n’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one - to - one , telling them what is expected			0
when he was my deputy , he gave me great support and during our 11 years with @entity8 i saw him blossom			2
there were times when , as a young lad , he did n’t always say the right things in the dressing room but he has matured and chooses his words carefully			1
teammates : @entity32 ( left ) is congratulated by @entity11 after scoring against @entity76 at @entity77 last year called it a day : @entity32 retired from international football in july after winning 114 caps for @entity8 he ’s brave , too			1
@entity47 wo n’t go missing in a game nor will he duck any issues with the media ; whether he is in world - class form or going through a difficult patch , he does n’t shy away from questions			2
do n’t think , though , he will expose players in public if things are n’t going well			2
that was n’t my style , nor will it be his			0
he knows the best place to deliver such words is in closed quarters and those he will have to speak to will appreciate him doing it the right way			0
i also believe it is important for an @entity8 captain to lead his club			2
everything that compelled @entity105 to make @entity107 captain after working with him for six weeks are the qualities that @entity1 has seen at every get - together for the past two years			1
my @entity8 journey with @entity47 started in march 2003			2
i ’d known of him since he was playing for @entity112 ’s under - 13 side with my cousin , @entity113			0
i was well aware of the hype surrounding him when he broke into @entity112 ’s first team			0
younger days : @entity32 ( right ) congratulates @entity11 on scoring for @entity8 against @entity116 in 2003 the heat is turned up , however , when you get selected for @entity8 and i remember thinking , when we joined up for that @entity121 qualifier away to @entity116 , ‘ let ’s have a proper look at what you ’ve got ’ before training with him for the first time			1
i missed his debut against @entity129 the previous month as i was injured			0
it quickly became apparent this was his stage			0
during a training game he conjured a chip from nothing that sailed over @entity136 ; it was an audacious thing to attempt but @entity47 — then only 17 — carried on as if it was the most natural thing to do			0
as the ball nestled in the net , the session stopped so everyone could applaud			0
it was n’t a bad way to settle yourself into the group			0
taking the armband wo n’t be new for @entity47 — he ’s led @entity8 before , against @entity146 in @entity147 in 2009 and @entity148 in october 2012 — but it is a different feeling from when you are just borrowing it			1
wearing the armband : @entity11 ( right ) is put under pressure by @entity148 's @entity153 in october 2012 @entity24 : @entity11 ( 3rd left ) captained @entity8 for the international friendly against @entity146 in @entity156 in 2009 i could n’t wait to walk into the dressing room after @entity1 gave me the news , and it will be the same for @entity47			1
he will be desperate to get to @entity77 for the @entity161 friendly and the added responsibility could be the catalyst to go on and break sir @entity165 ’s record of 49 goals			1
everything is there for him now			0
he is set to be captain and the next two tournaments , in @entity171 and @entity172 , are the most important he ’ll play in — they can define his legacy			0
we played together 71 times for @entity8 and at his best , he is a world - class talent			2
after the disappointment of @entity146 , this is a fresh start for everyone and @entity47 can lead the team positively into the new campaign			0
tearful goodbye : @entity32 ( centre ) was emotional after his last match for @entity8 at the @entity31 in @entity146 if and when he leads the team out on september 3 , i ’ll be delighted for him			1
we are two lads from council estates in @entity190 who have loved playing for @entity8 , and i know what emotions @entity47 will feel when he stands at the head of the line in the tunnel			0
and how will i feel ? i know i ’ve made the right decision and i ’ll enjoy having a breather , but i ’ll miss playing for @entity8			0
i know that for a fact .			0

there is no more worthy candidate to take over as captain than @entity11
the @entity24 captain is a natural leader and wo **n't** be fazed by the responsibility
@entity11 is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room
the *28* - year - old did **n't** always say the right things but he has matured
@entity11 has led @entity8 before against @entity146 in @entity147 in 2009 and @entity148 in october 2012
it could be the catalyst for him to break sir @entity165 's record of 49 goals
@entity8 manager @entity1 will reveal his new skipper this week
