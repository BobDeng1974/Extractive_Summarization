by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 10 august 2013 updated : 16:08 est , 10 august 2013 doctor @entity1 has the best burglar alarm system in the world – his reputation			1
known from television and radio appearances as the ‘ dog whisperer ’ , @entity1 spends his life surrounded by vicious canines , as he tames them for their wealthy owners , including royalty			1
you imagine a pack of slavering hounds patrolling his grounds			2
alpha dog : animal psychologist @entity1 and his dogs have made the 19th century mansion in @entity22 , @entity23 their home so it ’s a surprise when i arrive at his country house outside @entity22 , @entity23 , to find dog behaviourist @entity1 with only a deaf , cuddly 16 - year - old ‘ @entity31 mutt ’ called @entity33 ( named after @entity34 , whose distant demeanour he is said to share ) and bounce , a labrador with impeccable manners			1
in the conservatory i confess to being relieved at the reception			2
‘ hmm , wait until you meet the other two , ’ says @entity1 , 67 , with a twinkle in his eye , before making a quick call on his mobile			2
within minutes his son , @entity46 , 24 , appears clutching leads on which are tethered @entity48 , a @entity50 shepherd whose darting eyes give the distinct impression he is not to be messed with , and @entity53 , a @entity55 mastiff cross who makes an immediate lunge at parts of my body i ’d prefer to keep			2
‘ i got them both from the courts where they were about to be put down , ’ says @entity1 , patting and calming both dogs			2
‘ in the case of @entity53 , a very funny @entity71 judge announced , “ @entity72 , i sentence you to live with @entity1 for the rest of your life			2
” he is no problem , living here			2
sadly , @entity75 are one of the nicest breeds of dogs owned by some of the nastiest people			0
’ worth taking the plunge : after restoring the four - bedroom mansion , @entity1 has put it on the market for £ 1.25million @entity1 finds a story behind most things , including his house – one half of a 19th century mansion			1
‘ i found details of its history with the deeds , ’ he says			0
it was built in 1870 for @entity95 , of @entity96 in @entity98 fame , by her husband , @entity99 , whose father was a notable @entity101 politician , because she was scandalising polite @entity98 society			1
so she was sent here to the country and it seems she scandalised @entity23 too , although we are n’t sure how			1
’ @entity1 bought the house three years ago for £ 765,000 as a renovation project because he ‘ felt sorry for it ’			1
lady of the manor : the mansion was built for @entity95 in 1870 the heating did n’t work ; the roof needed mending ; the wiring was dangerous ; the colour scheme was out of @entity118 ’ wives ; and as it had been empty for some time , thieves had stolen stone from the terrace			1
at a cost of £ 200,000 , the house is now beautifully restored			1
@entity1 proudly shows off the large , modern kitchen leading to the elegant hall with black - and - white tiled floor , then two beautifully proportioned living rooms			1
upstairs , a grand landing has arches leading to four bedrooms			0
the colour scheme – muted pastels and light green shades – is soothing and the views , over farmland to the @entity136 , are to die for			0
curiously , @entity1 spends most of his time in his large , untidy conservatory			0
here , over tea , he regales me with tales of his royal clients			0
‘ the @entity143 is very knowledgeable and very authoritative , which is good because democracy does n’t work with animals , ’ he says of the time he was summoned to correct the @entity148 corgis after they attacked princess @entity150 ’s terrier			0
he was even more impressed by @entity151 , for whom he appeared in court when she was convicted under the @entity153 in 2002 after her bull terrier , @entity155 , attacked two children			0
‘ before we went into court , she whispered , “ if i go down , just remember one thing – @entity160 is a long way away ” – referring to the days when people would be banished there			0
’ the gardens , which @entity1 has also rescued , are a mixture of formality , in the rebuilt terrace and elegant swimming pool , and the unruly , in an area of wild garden			0
the house , admittedly , suffers road noise from the @entity173 , but it is an easy commute to @entity98 and it is n’t on the flight paths			0
it would suit a family , perhaps with a horse - loving child , as @entity1 owns adjoining land and would sell or rent a field to a future owner			1
as for @entity1 , he already owns a bungalow nearby and intends replacing it with an eco-house that he will design himself			0
dr @entity1 ’s house in @entity186 , @entity22 , is for sale at £ 1.25 million with @entity188 ( 01344 843000 )			1
the @entity189 , by dr @entity1 , is out now , published by @entity190 .			0
