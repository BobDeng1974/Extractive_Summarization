such is the global sporting fame of @entity1 that guests attending the star 's wedding to @entity5 this weekend might have wondered if they would be seated next to a famous face			1
@entity7 perhaps ? or fellow @entity9 @entity8 ? the answer is a resounding ' not likely '			0
when @entity1 , 27 , says ' i do ' with his long - term girlfriend , also 27 , on april 11 , the guests wishing them well in his hometown of @entity16 will be largely a gathering of close family and friends			1
low - key : in spite of high profile friendships with the likes of @entity24 , @entity1 and bride - to - be , @entity5 ( pictured here when @entity1 received his obe in 2013 ) have n't invited many big names to attend their wedding in @entity29 this weekend @entity30 in @entity31 shop the current collection at @entity33 ! buy now @entity5 has perfected her pristine style over the years			1
she always looks incredible whether she 's cheering on @entity1 at @entity35 or walking the red carpet at a glitzy event			1
she is renowned for championing @entity39 designers and has the ability to sell out items immediately after she 's worn them			1
@entity5 's often seen sporting chic outfits from the likes of @entity44 and @entity45 , but she really steps up her style game in high end designers like @entity48 and @entity49 when the occasion calls			2
this stunning fit - and - flare monochrome skater dress from celebrated @entity39 designer @entity30 is certainly no exception			2
the super-stylish silhouette puts a bold spin on the traditional evening dress			0
nipping in at the waist is the in shape this spring and it flatters all sizes			0
unfortunately @entity5 's style is from a previous season but click right to shop @entity30 's current collection			2

wear with black courts for a sophisticated nighttime look or tap into the grunge trend and dress yours down with biker boots and a luxe leather jacket			0
either way , this is one wardrobe essential that will be in favor with the fashion pack for seasons to come ! @entity79 w / @entity80 at @entity81 buy now @entity83 @entity82 @entity84 at @entity81 buy now @entity85 buy now @entity86 with pockets buy now @entity1 's status as one of the world 's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from @entity94 celebrities such as @entity24 to the prime minister and even the @entity96			1
but the biggest name likely to be in attendance at @entity99 , where the couple are tying the knot , is one - time @entity39 tennis star @entity102			1
indeed , when the sport 's world number one , @entity7 , was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration , he replied with a curt : ' not invited ' , before following up with a more charitable : ' but i wish him all the best			0
' as one of @entity1 's fiercest rivals on the court , it 's not surprising @entity7 is n't at the top of the guest list but it seems that , unlike a lot of famous faces , the couple have taken a more low - key approach when it comes to who to invite			1
@entity1 has said : ' there wo n't be any celebrities as such			2
' i do n't have any celebrity friends so it was n't something that was planned			0
' [ it 'll be ] everyone who we 're close to , people we 've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future			0
' that 's how we came up with the names			0
pretty much everything is done now and under control			0
i 'm sure a few things will come up next week but it 's pretty much sorted			0
' who made the list ? @entity39 player @entity144 ( left ) is a close friend of @entity1 's but celebrity pals such as @entity24 ( right ) , who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the @entity147 , wo n't be attending there will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of @entity154 or @entity155			1
@entity1 has invited @entity157 doubles player @entity156 , who he spends time with while training in @entity159 and @entity161 team mate @entity160			2
another @entity39 pro @entity144 will also attend			2
bride - to - be @entity5 was spotted cheering on her fiancé this weekend as he battled @entity7 in the men 's final at the @entity167 before the couple fly back to @entity169 ahead of their nuptials			1
for the 27 - year - old ’s many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community			2
it is understood local residents and businesses urged the former @entity35 champion to hold the april 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel @entity187 in nearby @entity188 – so they too could toast his big day			1
the reception will be held at @entity187 , which @entity1 owns			1
there 's a friendly rivalry on court between @entity1 and tennis world number one @entity7 but the @entity194 wo n't be attending @entity1 's nuptials this weekend lady in waiting : @entity5 watched her husband - to - be lose to @entity7 in the @entity167 in @entity198 , @entity199 last weekend			1
hundreds of well - wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at @entity99 , before @entity1 and @entity5 hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel @entity187 the 300 - seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at @entity187 , which seats only 28			1
thousands are expected to line @entity206 on the day			0
@entity1 ’s uncle @entity207 said : ‘ i ’m sure it will be a popular decision , as he ’s had so much support from the people of @entity16 in the past			2
@entity1 has admitted that , food aside , he 's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed : ' @entity5 ’s been pretty much doing it ' ' i ’ve tried to help out when she has asked , but i have n’t been over-involved			1
i did all the food and cake tasting which i really enjoyed , although i did n’t think i was going to			0
he added : ' it ’s a big day for @entity5			0
pretty much everything is taken care of now			0
she seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change			0

@entity1 and @entity5 will tie the knot on *saturday* april 11
wedding reception will be held at tennis star 's hotel @entity187 in @entity188
biggest star likely to attend is one - time @entity39 tennis star @entity102
